5|$|Exterior {{shots of}} Adipose Industries were filmed at the British Gas {{building}} (Helmont House) in Cardiff's city centre. For {{health and safety}} reasons, Tennant was prohibited from performing his own stunts in the window cleaning platform. His only <b>shot</b> <b>that</b> required stunts was when he catches Miss Foster's sonic pen, a <b>shot</b> <b>that</b> took several takes to perfect.|$|E
5|$|Seattle {{replaced}} Lamar Neagle with Pappa in the 74th {{minute in}} an attempt to create an advantage. Philadelphia answered with two more chances that almost won the match. Casey received a yellow card at the 57th minute and was later replaced by Pedro Ribeiro. In the 88th minute, Raymon Gaddis won the ball and took a <b>shot</b> <b>that</b> was deflected. Ribeiro took a shot but it lacked power. In stoppage time, Vincent Nogueira had another close <b>shot</b> <b>that</b> struck the post and ricocheted dangerously close to the goal before being cleared.|$|E
5|$|Overtime {{began with}} a jump ball that was won by Kansas' Chamberlain, who quickly passed the ball to King. King took a jump <b>shot</b> <b>that</b> missed and Carolina's Cunningham grabbed the rebound. The Tar Heels traversed the court and Bob Young managed to score a basket to give Carolina the edge. However, North Carolina was unable to stop Kansas during the ensuing drive as Chamberlain scored a basket to bring the score to 4848. After Kansas score the tying basket, North Carolina {{proceeded}} to hold the ball for one final shot before time ran out. Carolina's Kearns drove and put up a <b>shot</b> <b>that</b> was blocked by Chamberlain as time ran out.|$|E
50|$|A reason many box {{scores and}} stat sheets list {{the number of}} scoring chances is to {{differentiate}} between <b>shots</b> <b>that</b> are relatively easy saves for the goaltender (<b>shots</b> <b>that</b> are not scoring chances) and <b>shots</b> <b>that</b> are not easy saves (<b>shots</b> <b>that</b> are also scoring chances).|$|R

5|$|During this episode, {{the dogs}} had to {{interact}} with the main characters, which proved difficult. Actor Sean Bean reported that for the final scene where he has to sacrifice Lady, the animal was too scared to remain still. They had to keep rehearsing the scene until the dog felt comfortable, making a <b>shot</b> <b>that</b> should have taken a few minutes about three hours long.|$|E
5|$|England won the toss {{and elected}} to kick off. Within ninety seconds, Stanley Mortensen sent a cross {{from the left}} wing to Roy Bentley, who let off a <b>shot</b> <b>that</b> was barely pushed aside by U.S. goalkeeper Frank Borghi. By the 12th minute, England had six clear shots on goal but could not convert, with two shots hitting the post, one just going over the top, and another brilliantly saved by Borghi.|$|E
50|$|<b>Shots</b> <b>that</b> sail wide or high {{of the net}} and <b>shots</b> <b>that</b> hit the goalpost or {{crossbar}} are {{not counted}} as shots on goal, rather they are counted as 'missed shots'. Additionally, if a goaltender stops a puck that is going wide or high anyway, it is recorded as a 'missed shot'. Since it is not counted as a shot on goal, the goaltender does not get credit for a save.|$|R

5|$|Following the season, the Flames signed Regehr {{to another}} five-year {{contract}} extension worth {{a total of}} US$20-million. The deal {{was considered to be}} worth less than he could have gotten as an unrestricted free agent the following year, but he chose to take less to stay in a city his family enjoyed and on a team he felt was competitive. Regehr played all 82 games for the Flames in 2007–08 despite being hit in the face by the puck in a game, and suffering a deep bruise on his foot while blocking a <b>shot</b> <b>that</b> was initially feared to be a broken bone.|$|E
5|$|Frank, now entirely across Fremont {{street and}} still walking {{at a good}} pace {{according}} to Claiborne's testimony, fired twice more before {{he was shot in}} the head under his right ear. Both Morgan and Holliday apparently thought they had fired the <b>shot</b> <b>that</b> killed Frank, but since neither of them testified at the hearing, this information is only from second-hand accounts. A passerby testified to having stopped to help Frank, and saw Frank try to speak, but he died where he fell, before he could be moved.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Altgens testified for the Warren Commission and {{was asked}} about the gunfire and whether he knew its source. He said he had not been keeping track of the number of gunshots fired in Dealey Plaza because he {{believed}} them to be fireworks, but he was certain of at least two. Altgens believed Kennedy's wounds suggested a final <b>shot</b> <b>that</b> came from the vicinity of the book depository building, but he could not say with any certainty.|$|E

The pistol has three capabilities: a {{standard}} fire mode, {{the ability to}} create force fields to block enemy fire, and a powerful charged <b>shot</b> <b>that</b> can break through force fields and some walls. Enemies also have the same capabilities, requiring the player {{to take advantage of the}} three gun modes and the environment to overcome them.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's {{opponent}} in the fourth round was Leeds United. The match was played at Elland Road on 27 January 2001 {{in front of a}} near-capacity crowd of 37,108. The home team enjoyed much of the possession, but struggled to find a breakthrough as Liverpool's defence stood firm. Two minutes before full-time, Barmby, on as a substitute, scored the winning goal, rebounding a <b>shot</b> <b>that</b> came off the post. Barmby then turned provider for Liverpool's second, setting-up Heskey to score.|$|E

In the second round, Jensen began to visibly tire and after being hit, began to bleed from the nose. McGee won the second round after a takedown just before the bell. In the third round, McGee successfully executed a takedown and a full mount, where he secured an arm triangle choke to force the tapout at 1:21 of the final round.|$|E

5|$|The episode opens {{showing a}} horde of walkers as they follow a {{helicopter}} overhead, leaving Atlanta and migrating to the countryside over several days. As they near the Greene farm, they {{hear the sound of}} a gunshotfrom the <b>shot</b> <b>that</b> Carl (Chandler Riggs) used to kill a reanimated Shane Walshand they turn to head towards the farm. As Rick (Andrew Lincoln) escorts Carl back to the others, the walker horde emerges from the forest, and Rick and Carl take shelter in the barn.|$|E
5|$|The next possession, Kansas' John Parker {{stole the}} ball and crossed half court when coach Harp called a timeout. Chamberlain {{received}} {{the ball in the}} post, went up for a shot and received some contact; however, no referee called a foul and the ball rolled out of bounds off Carolina. The next play, Elstun was run into by a Tar Heel and went to the line for two shots with 31 seconds remaining, where he missed the first and made the second shot. Out of timeouts, Kearns drove into the lane and put up a <b>shot</b> <b>that</b> was blocked out of bounds by Chamberlain. The following play, Quigg pumpfaked and went up for a <b>shot</b> <b>that</b> Chamberlain blocked; however, simultaneously King made contact with Quigg's body while shooting and the referees called a shooting foul. Quigg went to the free throw line for two shots with six seconds to go and made both, which gave the Tar Heels the lead 5453. Kansas called a timeout and in-bounded to Loneski who then passed the ball towards Chamberlain who was under the basket. The pass was under thrown and Quigg tipped the ball away from Chamberlain. Kearns grabbed {{the ball and}} got away from a defender before he threw the ball into the air to run out the clock. Time expired as the ball was in the air and the Tar Heels won the National Championship.|$|E
5|$|United faced Liverpool {{at home in}} the {{following}} round, where the visitors took the lead from a Michael Owen header inside three minutes. In spite of creating plenty of goalscoring chances, the team failed to equalise until the 86th minute, when Yorke scored off a Beckham free kick. In the second minute of stoppage time, Ole Gunnar Solskjær hit a <b>shot</b> <b>that</b> sent Liverpool goalkeeper David James the wrong way to give United the win.|$|E

5|$|A {{reported}} 10,000 Celtic fans travelled to Germany {{to cheer}} on Celtic {{in the second}} leg. John Hartson returned from suspension to the starting line-up whilst defender Ulrik Laursen also came into the side; with Shaun Maloney and Jackie McNamara dropping out. After early pressure from Stuttgart, Celtic scored on 12 minutes; Hartson played a pass from midfield out wide right to Didier Agathe, who raced down the wing and on reaching the bye-line crossed in to the Stuttgart penalty box. Hartson headed the ball towards the back post and Alan Thompson scored with a diving header. Two minutes later Celtic extended their lead. Agathe was again the provider, racing 50 yards down the right wing and cutting {{the ball into the}} penalty box to Chris Sutton who scored from close range with a powerful <b>shot.</b> <b>That</b> left Stuttgart requiring to score five goals to salvage the tie. A comeback by the Bundesliga club saw them eventually win 3–2 on the second leg, but Celtic won the tie 5–4 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the book}} Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, the censors in charge of {{enforcing}} the Production Code wrangled with Hitchcock because some of them insisted they could see one of Leigh's breasts. Hitchcock held onto the print for several days, left it untouched, and resubmitted it for approval. Each of the censors reversed their positions: those who had previously seen the breast now did not, {{and those who had}} not, now did. They passed the film after the director removed one <b>shot</b> <b>that</b> showed the buttocks of Leigh's stand-in. The board was also upset by the racy opening, so Hitchcock said that if they let him keep the shower scene he would re-shoot the opening with them on the set. Since they did not show up for the re-shoot, the opening stayed.|$|E
5|$|After fierce fighting, the Comanches fled. Ross {{and several}} of his men pursued the chief and a second, unknown, rider. As the Rangers neared, the second rider slowed and held a child over her head; the men did not shoot, but instead {{surrounded}} and stopped her. Ross continued to follow the chief, eventually shooting him three times. The chief refused to surrender, even after falling from his horse. Ross's cook, Anton Martinez, who had been a captive in Nocona's band, identified the fallen chief as Nocona. With Ross's permission, Martinez fired the <b>shot</b> <b>that</b> took Nocona's life. Nocona was the only Comanche male to die in the fighting; 13 Comanche women were also killed. Ross's men suffered no casualties.|$|E

50|$|On March 22, 2008, Andrade {{scored the}} biggest victory {{of his career}} against former IBF number one {{contender}} Robert Stieglitz of Germany. Andrade dominated the fight from the opening round with uppercuts and body <b>shots</b> <b>that</b> left Stieglitz continually on the defensive. Landing a solid right in the eighth round, Stieglitz was left staggered. Andrade followed up with flurry of <b>shots</b> <b>that</b> led to referee stop the fight, giving Andrade a TKO victory. As this was an eliminator bout, Andrade has been lined up for a fight with IBF Super Middleweight champion Lucian Bute.|$|R
