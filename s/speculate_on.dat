At the time, both Rowe and Jackson requested privacy {{and asked the}} public not to <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> {{the reasons for their}} divorce.

5|$|On 18 September, 96, Domitian {{was assassinated}} in a palace {{conspiracy}} organised by court officials.

Nerva was old and childless, and had spent much of his career out of the public light, prompting both ancient and modern authors to <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> his involvement in Domitian's assassination.|$|E

5|$|The {{receiver}} {{offered the}} barn to Hillingdon Council and English Heritage for £1, but both refused the offer. Instead, a Gibraltar-based company calling itself Harmondsworth Barn Ltd bought the barn. The company {{had no other}} assets and {{it was reported that}} it was seeking to <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> obtaining compensation from a proposed expansion of Heathrow Airport. Such compensation would be paid should the land be required and the property demolished, although the barn fell just slightly outside the area required for a new runway. The new owners made no effort to maintain the barn, which fell into disrepair and was closed to the public apart from an annual one-day opening in conjunction with the Open House Weekend each September.|$|E

5|$|In 1806 Jennings {{headed west}} to Jeffersonville in the Indiana Territory, but stayed only briefly. He moved to Vincennes, {{the capital of}} the Indiana Territory, in early 1807 to open his own law {{practice}} and was admitted to the bar in April. Jennings had difficulty earning an income as a lawyer, finding there were too few clients in the territory to keep him busy. In July 1807 Nathaniel Ewing, the federal land receiver at Vincennes and a friend from Pennsylvania, invited Jennings to take a job as assistant to John Badollet, the registrar at the federal land office in Vincennes. Along with Badollet, Jennings engaged in land speculation. He obtained significant land holdings and made substantial profits. In 1807 Jennings became an assistant to the clerk of the territorial legislature and continued to <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> the sale of public lands.|$|E
5|$|The impenetrable Venusian {{cloud cover}} gave science fiction writers free rein to <b>speculate</b> <b>on</b> {{conditions}} at its surface; {{all the more}} so when early observations showed that not only was it similar in size to Earth, it possessed a substantial atmosphere. Closer to the Sun than Earth, the planet was frequently depicted as warmer, but still habitable by humans. The genre reached its peak between the 1930s and 1950s, at a time when science had revealed some aspects of Venus, but not yet the harsh reality of its surface conditions. Findings from the first missions to Venus showed the reality to be quite different, and brought this particular genre to an end. As scientific knowledge of Venus advanced, so science fiction authors tried to keep pace, particularly by conjecturing human attempts to terraform Venus.|$|E
