50|$|Zoggs is a {{brand of}} {{swimming}} goggles, training aids, swimwear and other related products. The company launched in Sydney, Australia in 1992 {{and was the first}} brand to offer UV protection and <b>split</b> <b>yoke</b> straps as standard features on all goggles.|$|E
40|$|Following the {{successful}} {{testing of the}} first 1 -metre model of the 70 mm aperture quadrupole for the LHC low-beta insertions, two further 1 -metre magnets have been built. All magnets feature a four-layer coil wound from two 8. 2 mm wide graded NbTi cables and a four-way <b>split</b> <b>yoke</b> supporting structure. In this paper we review the training history of the three magnets performed at 4. 3 K and 1. 9 K in several tests. All magnets surpassed the operating gradient required for the LHC, with the third magnet reaching 260 T/m, its short-sample gradient at 1. 9 K. The peak temperatures in the superconductor at various operating conditions are reported and a summary of magnetic field measurements is given...|$|E
40|$|The 56 mm single {{aperture}} superconducting dipole {{model with}} a 5 -block coil configuration was reassembled and tested to investigate {{the full support of}} electromagnetic forces using a high-manganese steel collar structure without $ 9 mechanical contribution from an iron yoke. The reassembled model, which has a gap between the high manganese steel collar and the horizontally <b>split</b> iron <b>yoke,</b> reached a central field of 9 tesla (93554330 f short sample) at the firs...|$|R
40|$|The picture {{shows the}} cold {{mass of the}} Quadrupole with its outer {{aluminium}} alloy rings pre-compressing the superconducting coils via the magnetic <b>yoke</b> <b>split</b> in 4 parts. The end of the inner vacuum chamber,supporting the 6 -pole correction windings, {{can also be seen}} as well as the electrical connections. See also photos 7702690 X, 7702307...|$|R
40|$|Fermilab {{has begun}} {{investigating}} Nb/sub 3 /Sn twin aperture dipole magnet designs as a next step towards {{the realization of}} high field magnets for a Very Large Hadron Collider (VLHC). The magnet design is based on two-layer shell-type Nb/sub 3 /Sn coils with 43. 5 mm aperture. Two different mechanical designs were investigated, one with "cold" iron yoke {{and the other with}} "warm" iron yoke. The former has a vertically <b>split</b> three-piece iron <b>yoke</b> with a cut parallel to a flux line to reduce the transverse magnetic flux. The two outer halves are locked in place by aluminum clamps. Both the clamps and the stainless skin provide the required pre-stress to the coils. The "warm" iron yoke design consists of thick freestanding stainless steel collars with wide keys and an insert separating the two coil blocks. The paper presents both the mechanical design and analysis for the two designs. (5 refs) ...|$|R
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the suppression of flux jumps and the enhancement of trapped field on a thin, high-J$_{c}$ MgB₂ bulk (30 mm in diameter and 7 mm in thickness) for the pulsed field magnetization (PFM) using a split-type coil with a soft iron yoke, and compared the results to those magnetized using the split-type coil without a yoke and a solenoid-type coil with a yoke. A maximum-trapped field, B$_{z}$, of 0. 71 T at 14 K was achieved on the bulk surface without flux jumps by using the <b>split</b> coil with <b>yoke.</b> On the other hand, low B$_{z}$ values with flux jumps were observed for the cases using the split-type coil without a soft iron yoke, and the solenoid-type coil with a yoke. These results reproduce previous ones for a thick, high-J$_{c}$ MgB₂ bulk (22 mm in diameter and 15 mm in thickness), for which the trapped field was enhanced to a record high value of B$_{z}$= 1. 10 T at 13 K by PFM using the split-type coil with a yoke...|$|R
