40|$|Abstract- – The {{biological}} {{characters of}} Scolytus nitidus were investigated {{both in the}} field and in the laboratory as well. This common <b>shot-hole</b> <b>borer</b> overwinters in larval stage on apple trees in Kashmir. After emergence the adults fly to suitable trees and undergo maturation feeding for 4 - 6 days. The copulation takes place at the entrance hole. The maternal gallery is one armed longitudinal, in average 4. 6 cm long. The female lays 52 eggs on an average. The eggs hatch in 5 to 7 days. The larvae have 5 instars and complete their development in 38 to 50 days constructing larval galleries 5 - 8 cm in length. The larvae pupate for 6 - 18 days and finally the adults emerge to attack new suitable trees. The adults live for 45 - 60 days and the total life-span of this species ranges from 97 to 124 days. The seasonal distribution of various life stages and the number of generations were also recorded...|$|E

40|$|In 1898 a <b>shot-hole</b> <b>borer,</b> {{identified}} as X. perforans (Woll.) appeared in an experimental plantation of sugar-cane varieties at Kagok, near Tegal, West Java. Zehntner, the Swiss entomologist {{on the staff}} of the Sugar-cane Experimental Station at Kagok, used the opportunity to study the borer extensively in the laboratory as well as in the field. The borer was already notorious at the time by its boring into the bung and staves of wine-casks in Madeira and beercasks in India, which caused leakages ²). Zehntner published the very important results of his investigations in an extensive paper written for the planters in the Dutch language, in 1900. A summary of this paper on ”De riet-schorskever” (the cane bark-borer) was inserted in an annual report for 1900. An excerpt of the paper, quoting some parts verbatim but wanting several of the most interesting biological details, appeared in 1906 in VAN DEVENTER’S volume on „De dierlijke vijanden van het suikerriet en hunne parasieten” (= The enemies of sugar-cane and their parasites) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} on {{the rate of}} development of Xyleborus fornicatus (Eichh.) was determined by rearing individuals under a range of constant temperatures (15 - 32 degrees C). Rates of development changed in a linear fashion {{over a wide range}} of temperatures. Estimates of lower development thresholds were obtained for eggs (15. 7 +/- 0. 50 degrees C), larvae (15. 8 +/- 0. 8 degrees C) and pupae (14. 3 +/- 1. 4 degrees C) and the degree days (DD) for development were 70 +/- 4. 4, 95 +/- 8. 5 and 72 +/- 5. 1 DD, respectively. Optimum temperature for development was around 30 degrees C for all stages. Temperature fluctuation in cooler High Country areas (above 1400 m) with a mean temperature around 15 degrees C seems to be critical {{for the development of the}} pest, which may be responsible for the near absence of pest in those areas. Temperature fluctuations (18 - 30 degrees C) in the Mid Country region (600 - 1200 m) favor the development of the pest compared to development under constant conditions. The altitudinal distribution of the <b>shot-hole</b> <b>borer</b> across tea growing areas in Sri Lanka is, therefore, mainly governed by temperature...|$|E
40|$|The tea <b>shot-hole</b> <b>borer,</b> Euwallacea fornicatus Eichhoff, is an {{ambrosia beetle}} endemic to Asia and a pest of {{commercial}} tea, Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze. Recently, {{a complex of}} species morphologically similar to E. fornicatus has been recognized, which includes new pests established in Israel and the USA, both in California and Florida. Collectively termed E. nr. fornicatus, these cryptic species carry symbiotic Fusarium spp. fungi, some of which cause dieback disease in susceptible hosts, which include avocado, Persea americana Miller. Due to the threat to this economically important crop, research was initiated to evaluate efficacy of kairomone-based lures for detection of the beetle in Florida (termed the Florida tea shot hole borer, FL-TSHB). A series of field tests were conducted in 2016 in commercial avocado groves known to have FL-TSHB at various population levels. All tests evaluated lures containing quercivorol (p-menth- 2 -en- 1 -ol) and α-copaene, presented separately and in combination; and one test evaluated effect of trap type on beetle captures. In addition, electroantennography (EAG) was used to quantify female olfactory responses to lure emissions. This study identified (-) -α-copaene as a new attractant for FL-TSHB, equivalent in efficacy to quercivorol (the standard lure for Euwallacea detection in the USA); however, the combination of lures captured significantly more FL-TSHB than either lure alone. This combination resulted in synergistic attraction at two field sites and additive attraction at a third site. Sticky panel traps captured more FL-TSHB than comparably-baited Lindgren funnel traps. Females engaged in host-seeking flight from 11 : 00 to 16 : 00 hr (EST), with peak numbers observed between 12 : 00 and 13 : 00 hr. EAG analyses confirmed olfactory chemoreception of both kairomones, with a higher response elicited with the combination of volatiles. Results indicate that detection of pest E. nr. fornicatus in Florida can be improved by using a two-component lure consisting of p-menth- 2 -en- 1 -ol and (-) -α-copaene...|$|E
30|$|Olive {{is one of}} the {{important}} economical crops in Egypt. Olive trees are attacked by insect pests that affect quality and quantity of the yield. On olive trees, populations of the fruit fly, Bacteracera (Dacus) oleae Gamel are suppressed by the braconid parasitoid, Opius concolor Szepl. (Ajjan 1962), and those of the olive scale insect Parasaissetia oleae by the pteromalid parasitoid Sautellistea cyanea Mols. (Hosny et al. 1966). The two stem borers, Phlocotribus scarabaeides Bern. and Zeuzera pyrina L. are parasitized by two pteromalids, Cheiropochus quadrum and Rhaphitelus maculatus, and two unidentified species belonging to the genera Euplemus and Eurytoma (Ismail et al. 1988). The <b>shot-hole</b> <b>borer</b> Scolytus amaygdali (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) of olive trees is parasitized during its larval stage by seven hymenopterous parasitoids, i.e., Cerocephala cornigera, Cheiropachus quadrum, Rhaphites maculatus (Pteromalidae), Cephalonoma sp. (Bethylidae), Eupelmus sp. (Eupelmidae), Eurytoma sp. (Eurytomidae), and Leptomastix trunctellus (Encyrtidae) (Ismail et al. 1988). In most recent studies, El-Khawas et al. (2000) presented a detail record concerning parasitoids on common olive pests in Egypt, in Alexandria, Fayoum, and North Sinai Governorates. Opius concolor Szeph. (Braconidae), Prigalio agraules Walker (Eulophidae), Eupelmus sp. and Macroneara sp. (Eurytomidae), Eurytoma martelli Masi and Eurytoma sp. (Eurytomidae), and Cryptoprymna latipes Ronaldi (Pteromalidae) were reported on larvae of Bacterocera (Dacus) oleae, and Prays oleae Bern that feed on leaves, flower buds, and fruits was subject to attack by Apanteles sp. and Bracon sp. (Braconidae), while the Jasmine moth, Palipta unionalis Hb., that feeds on buds was parasitized by Apanteles syleptae F. (Braconidae) and Brachymeria aegyptiaca Masi (Chalcididae). The armored scale insect Leucaspis riccae Targ was attacked by Aphytis sp., while the California red scale A. aurantii by Marietta sp. (Aphelinidae) and Habrolepis sp. (Encyrtidae). A recent survey on parasitoids of B. oleae carried out by El-Heneidy et al. (2001 b) in Alexandria and El-Fayoum Governorates included eight hymenopterous parasitoids namely Cyroptyx latipes R., Cyroptyx sp., Eupelmus sp., Eurytoma sp., Eurytoma martelli, Macroneura sp., Prigalio agraules W., and Opius concolor S. The first seven species were recorded {{for the first time in}} Egypt. The eighth parasitoid species was recorded in the fresh fruits, while only six were recorded from the fallen fruits. All species were recorded during the period from July to November. Mean percentages of parasitism reached 38.9 and 10.8 % by the two species; O. concolor and P. agraules, respectively.|$|E
