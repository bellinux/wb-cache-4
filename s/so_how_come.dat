5000|$|The {{origin of}} this people forms a complex {{aspect of their}} pre-colonial {{historical}} information. Some of the earlier sources including the colonial once are mostly inadequate and contradicting. For instance, in attempt to trace this people’s origin, A.G. Armstrong asserted {{that the people of}} Ijigban, Ekele and Ulayi traced their traditions of origins to the Ngor in Ogoja province and are closely related. He therefore quoted Simey [...] "that the Igumale, Ulayi, Agila and Ijigban are closely related, and all entered the area {{at about the same time}} and there are definite boundaries between these clans based on hunting right". His description of the people by name referred to as [...] "Ijigbam-Ishieke" [...] was not only contradicting but also has generated derogatory pitfall because, while the Ijigban people are one section of the original Idoma, the same could not be true about the Ishieke people of the Abakaliki. <b>So</b> <b>how</b> <b>come</b> [...] "Ijigbam-Ishieke"? In another dimension, the Agila and the Ijigban (including Igumale, Ulayi and Utonkon alike) did not come to this present abode at the same time as claimed by Simey and supported by A.G. Armstrong. Reason been that while Agila traced the traditional of origin to [...] "western origins" [...] C. 165-1775, the Ijigban alongside Igumale attributed theirs to [...] "Eastern origins" [...] C. 1535-1745. For instance, according to E.O Erim, [...] "The modern Agila district in Idomaland recalled that their ancestor Ago, who moved out from areas south of Idah C. 1625 - 1655, was of Bini extraction. He was the son of an unnamed Oba of Benin". The point we are trying to put across here, is that while Ijigban, Igumale claimed Apa as their traditional home land, the people of Agila may ignore that. At this juncture, R.G. Armstrong account could be say to be devoid of empirical historical fact.|$|E
