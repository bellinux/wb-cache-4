40|$|Using a mode {{coupling}} technique we investigate the dynamics near the isotropic-nematic transition in liquid crystalline sidechain polymers. While in mean field approximation one obtains z = 1 for the dynamical critical exponent z for the relaxation {{time of the}} order parameter, we get from {{mode coupling}} the value z = 1. 5, a result which is in agreement with recent experiments done in Martinoty's group on two different classes of sidechain liquid crystalline polymers using electric and acoustic birefringence measurements. An analysis of recent measurements of the dynamic <b>stress-optical</b> <b>coefficient</b> in sidechain elastomers shows that mode coupling effects are also important in that case. ...|$|E
40|$|The complex strain-optical {{coefficient}} and {{the complex}} Young's modulus of Bisphenol-AP Polycar-bonate were measured around the glass-to-rubber transition zone. The {{data were analyzed}} with the modified stress-optical rule, and two component functions (denoted by G and R) were determined. The results were {{compared with those of}} Bisphenol A polycarbonate, and the effect of the displace-ment of methyl side groups by phenyl groups was discussed. The displacement reduced the modified <b>stress-optical</b> <b>coefficient</b> of the R component which is related to the orientation of polymer chains and determines the viscoelastic behavior in the rubbery plateau and flow zones, but did not affect the coefficient of the G component in the glassy zone. The displacement also affected the glass transition temperature and entanglement spacing...|$|E
40|$|Results of stress-strain, {{infrared}} dichroism, and birefringence {{experiments on}} silica-filled poly(dimethylsiloxane) networks show strong upturns {{of the stress}} with increasing deformation while segmental-orientation-strain relations remain linear over the same deformation range. As {{a result of this}} difference, the <b>stress-optical</b> <b>coefficient</b> exhibits an unusual dependence on deformation. The upturn in the stress results from the limited extensibility of the chains, inferred from the upturns in the Mooney-Rivlin plots presented. To explain these observations from a molecular perspective, we characterized the end-to-end distributions of different length poly(dimethylsiloxane) chains by Monte Carlo isomeric state calculations and derived stress-deformation-orientation relations for networks made of these chains by employing the three-chain network model. The results of the molecular model, in parallel with experimental observation, show strong differences between stress and orientation behavior...|$|E
40|$|The dynamic Young's modulus E′ {{and loss}} modulus E″ were {{obtained}} for isolated bovine cornea using a direct-reading dynamic viscoelastometer. Within the temperature range (0 - 60 °C) and frequency range (3. 5 - 110 Hz) studied, both moduli were temperature and frequency independent. The dynamic birefringence of the cornea was measured in a special apparatus designed for this purpose {{in conjunction with the}} dynamic viscoelastometer. The <b>stress-optical</b> and strain-optical <b>coefficients</b> as well as the corresponding phase angles were evaluated as a function of temperature and frequency.

40|$|In high {{performance}} electronic systems, with increasing chip speed and {{larger number of}} processors, the system performance is being limited by off-chip metal interconnects. In such systems, polymer optical waveguides are being considered to replace electrical interconnects because of their high capacity for bandwidth and less constraints on interconnect length. The optical loss in the polymer optical waveguides is the key criterion used to evaluate their performance, and is significantly affected by thermal curing and aging. The evolution of degree-of-cure is determined from differential scanning calorimetry and compared to optical absorption from spectroscopy. Optical loss due to scattering mechanisms is related to local density fluctuations, which is studied using dielectric analysis. Based on the optical loss trends in uncladded and cladded waveguides, the underlying mechanisms for the optical loss variations are proposed and a cure process schedule to realize the lowest optical loss is recommended. Process-induced thermal stresses can also affect the polymer waveguide by introducing stress birefringence. The <b>stress-optical</b> <b>coefficients</b> of the siloxane polymer are extracted and employed in a numerical modeling method to determine the stress-induced birefringence in an optical waveguide system. The thermal-aging dependent optical loss is determined for waveguide samples at several different accelerated temperature conditions. To get the field-use conditions, the temperature distribution {{in the vicinity of}} the embedded laser and the polymer waveguide is determined. Using such thermal experimental data, the analytical reliability models were employed to relate the optical loss with time, and provide a practical way of determining whether the optical waveguides would perform within the optical loss budget during field-use conditions.

40|$|The {{orientation}} {{dynamics of}} low-mass compounds (LMCs) in cross-linked rubber during uniaxial stretching were studied. Small amounts of LMCs such as 4 -cyano- 4 '-pentylbiphenyl (5 CB) and styrene-based tackifier (TF) were added into polybutadiene rubber (BR). The rubber sheets were uniaxially stretched by a tensile machine {{equipped with an}} optical system to measure both the retardation and the stress-strain curve simultaneously. It is found that the orientation of LMC molecules does not relax even after the cessation of stretching. The results demonstrate that orientation relaxation of LMC molecules hardly occurs because of the Nematic interaction, i. e., internal orientation correlation. The <b>stress-optical</b> <b>coefficient</b> C_R is enhanced {{by the addition of}} 5 CB, whereas the TF addition decreases the birefringence. The results demonstrate that both 5 CB and TF-molecules are oriented to the stretching direction with BR chains...|$|E
40|$|International audienceReflection {{anisotropy}} spectra (RAS) of transparent elastomeric polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) {{have been}} determined over the spectral range 1. 5 eV to 5. 0 eV {{for a range}} of tensile loads. Using a slight wedge shaped sample the spectra from the incident air/PDMS surface are shown to be weak and largely featureless at all loads. By contrast the spectra from the light transmitted through the sample and reflected at the other interface are large in magnitude and exhibit features which arise from the small stress birefringence of PDMS. The birefringent dominated spectra can readily be simulated using expressions derived from a Stokes-Mueller treatment of the optical system and this enabled the <b>stress-optical</b> <b>coefficient</b> to be determined at any energy within the spectral range covered. It is shown that there is a small angle between the optical axes and the mechanical axes in the sample and that {{this is consistent with the}} model of an elastomer which comprises a network of soft linear chains cross linked with stiff bridges...|$|E
40|$|Cross-linked {{samples of}} {{polyethylene}} were prepared by electron irradiation of both {{high and low}} density polymers in the crystalline state. A further cross-linked sample was obtained by curing a high density polyethylene by reaction with dicumyl peroxide at 180 °C. The stress-strain birefringence relations were obtained, on specimens cut from these samples, at temperatures between 130 and 250 °C. All samples showed a substantial decrease in <b>stress-optical</b> <b>coefficient</b> with increasing degree of cross-linking and with increasing temperature. The stress-optical properties at each temperature were extrapolated to zero degree of cross-linking to give quantities characteristic of the Guassian network. Comparison of these properties with Gaussian theory of the network leads to a value of ca. 1150 cals/mole for the difference in energy between trans and gauche conformations of successive links of the polyethylene chain and also indicates that the optical anisotropy of a - CH 2 group in the elastomeric state is more nearly given by Denbigh’s than by Bunn and Daubeny's polaris-abilities...|$|E
40|$|Multiple-beam Fizeau fringes {{are used}} to study the changes in optical {{parameters}} of annealed Nylon 66 fibers. Changes in the refractive indices and birefringence of skin and core have been measured interferometrically. The application was carried out using multiple-beam Fizeau fringes in transmission to determine the principal optical parameters characterizing the skin-core layers. The density of the fibers was measured by a system based on the theory of vibrating strings. The results of density and optical measurement were {{used to calculate the}} degree of crystallinity, the form birefringence, the number of monomeric units per unit volume, the harmonic mean polarizability of the dielectric, the harmonic mean specific refractivity and the virtual refractive index. The results also were used to obtain the <b>stress-optical</b> <b>coefficient</b> C s, the optical configuration parameter D a, the mean square density fluctuation , the segment anisotropy g s, molar refractivity R and the thermal stress s in different annealing conditions. The results clarify the reorientation, and layer changes occuring due to annealing conditions. The optical orientation function and the angle of orientation are also calculated. Relations between the optical parameters with different thermal effects are discussed...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Stress, strain, {{and optical}} {{birefringence}} were measured {{for a series}} of peroxide-cured natural rubbers, having both isotropic and double network structures. The residual stretch (permanent set) for the latter ranged from 2. 0 to 4. 5, with elastic moduli that were an increasing function of this residual strain, as found in previous works. A small birefringence, ca. 10 - 5, was observed for the unstressed double networks, and its magnitude increased with increasing residual strain. The sign of this birefringence corresponded to extension of the (undeformed) double networks. Under stress, the birefringence followed the stress optical law. The double network properties were interpreted using the constrained-chain model of rubber elasticity, with the assumption of independent, additive contributions from the two component networks. The calculated results differed from the experimental findings, in particular underestimating the residual strain. This failure is a consequence of the overprediction of the stresses during compression, a limitation common to molecular theories of rubber elasticity. The modeling of the double networks does account qualitatively for the sign of their unstressed birefringence, which is due to the <b>stress-optical</b> <b>coefficient</b> being larger in tension than in compression. This particular deviation from the stress-optical law is known from both theory and experiment...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In the {{preceding}} publication, {{we showed that}} the hyperbranched polystyrenes (HBPS) synthesized {{as part of this}} study may be viewed as starlike molecules with a high branch density, which are either unentangled or weakly entangled. In this paper, the role of architecture, especially the branch density, on the rheological and orientation behavior is investigated using simultaneous, quantitative stress and flow birefringence measurements in the melt state. Linear PS and eight-arm symmetric PS stars follow the stress-optical rule (SOR) over a wide dynamic range, with the <b>stress-optical</b> <b>coefficient</b> (C) governed by the arm molecular weight. When the branch density is “moderate ” (greater than 20 arms), there is only a hint of nonterminal behavior in the viscoelastic moduli, while the C drops by 30 % compared to a star with eight arms of comparable length. When the branch density is “high ” (50 arms), and the arms are unentangled, the nonterminal behavior in G * is clearly apparent, and there is a dramatic breakdown in the stress-optical rule in these homopolymer melts. The quantitative birefringence measurements suggest that the “excess ” birefringence {{may be due to the}} “form ” contributions from the core-shell structure. Such a structure may be formed by the preferential radial stretching of the chain segments near the core, as suggested by other studies on hyperstars. For comparable chain density, the core would be bigger than the shell when the arm length is smaller. Therefore, the 5 K-HBPS exhibits a more severe breakdown compared to the 10 K-HBPS...|$|E
40|$|The rheo-optical {{behaviors}} and suspension stability of silica particles coated with silane coupling agents were investigated experimentally. Mono-dispersed silica particles were synthe-sized by the sol – gel method and the particles were coated with silane coupling agents such as vinyltriethoxy silane (VTES) and g-methacryloxypropyl triethoxy silane (MPTES). Although all the suspensions of identical particle volume fraction exhibited similar rheological behaviors at high shear rates, only the sta-bilized suspensions coated with either VTES or MPTES dis-played smooth shear thinning rather than abrupt {{change in the}} shear viscosity, as is typical of suspensions with no surface treatment. The present study showed that the MPTES coating was very effective in enhancing the phase stability compared to the VTES coating. The flow-induced dichroism for the MPTES-coated suspensions did not experience sign change, while those of the non-stabilized suspensions changed sign as the shear rate was increased. The VTES-coated suspensions underwent a transition from a stable to an unstable state as the particle volume fraction increased. Specifically, the rheological behav-iors of the VTES-coated suspensions of particle volume fraction 0. 35 {{were similar to those}} of the MPTES-coated suspensions. When the volume fraction exceeded 0. 45, however, the effect of VTES coating diminished. Finally, the stress-optical rule pro-posed by Bender and Wagner was adopted to model the stabi-lized suspensions considered here. The present results indicated that the <b>stress-optical</b> <b>coefficient</b> could be predicted successfully by the proposed stress-optical rule if the contribution from the hydrodynamic interaction is considered separately from the thermodynamic contribution. © 1998 Academic Press Key Words: stabilization; silica dispersion; shear thinning; rheo-optics; dichroism; silane coupling agents...|$|E
40|$|In this work, hyperbranched {{polymers}} {{of different}} molecular weights and different molecular architectures have been simulated using a coarse-grained model and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics techniques. A number of structural parameters and the rheology of hyperbranched polymer melts under shear were analysed {{to explain the}} effect of the molecular structure and molecular weight on microscopic as well as macroscopic properties. In order to determine the shear-induced changes in the structural properties of hyperbranched polymers, various parameters were calculated at different strain rates. The radii of gyration which characterize the size of the polymer were evaluated. The relationship between the zero shear rate mean squared radius of gyration and the molecular weight as well as the Wiener index was established. The tensor of gyration was analysed and results indicate that hyperbranched polymer molecules have a prolate ellipsoid shape under shear. As hyperbranched polymers have compact, highly branched architecture and layers of beads have increasing densities which might lead to an unusual distribution of mass, the distribution of beads was also studied. The distribution of terminal beads was investigated to understand the spatial arrangement of these groups which is very important for hyperbranched polymer applications, especially in drug delivery. Flow birefringence was characterized by taking into account both form and intrinsic birefringences which result from molecular and bond alignment respectively. The melt rheology of hyperbranched polymer structures with different molecular weights and different number of spacers was also studied. Systems were simulated over a wide range of strain rates to capture the crossover behaviour from Newtonian to non-Newtonian regimes. Rheological properties including the shear viscosity and first and second normal stress coefficients were computed and the transition to shear thinning was observed at different strain rates for hyperbranched polymers of different sizes and topologies. The results were consistent with findings from NEMD simulations of linear and dendritic polymers. The stress-optical rule was tested and shown to be valid only in the Newtonian regime and violated in the strong flow regime where the rule {{does not take into account}} flow-induced changes of the micro structure. The <b>stress-optical</b> <b>coefficient</b> was found to be independent of the molecular weight and topology of polymers. Blends of hyperbranched polymers and linear polymers were also simulated and their rheological properties were investigated. Results show that even a small proportion of hyperbranched polymer in a melt of linear chains can reduce the shear viscosity of the whole system. This feature makes hyperbranched polymers a potential candidate as rheology modifiers. However there is no observed limit in the proportion of hyperbranched polymers in the samples above which the viscosity is stabilized. The viscosity drops continuously, correlating with the amount of hyperbranched polymers present...|$|E
