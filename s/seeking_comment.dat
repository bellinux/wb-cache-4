2500|$|During his post-game press conference, Texas Tech's Mike Leach {{used most}} of his time to rail against the officiating crew for making what he felt were bad calls. [...] He speculated that the {{officials}} may have favored Texas because the head official lives in Austin, because they are incompetent, or possibly because the conference wants Texas to appear in a BCS bowl because of the increased appearance fees that such a bowl generates for the conference. [...] Jim Vertuno of the Associated Press wrote [...] "Leach was upset officials disallowed two Tech touchdowns in the third quarter. The first was overruled when video replay clearly showed the receiver let the ball hit the ground. On the next play, a touchdown pass was negated by a holding penalty. Leach also wanted, but didn't get, a flag for roughing the quarterback." [...] The Lubbock Avalanche-Journal reported, [...] "Big 12 policy prohibits coaches from commenting publicly about game officials, so Leach's actions leave him open to reprimand, fine or worse." [...] ESPN reported, [...] "Big 12 official spokesman Bob Burda did not immediately respond to telephone messages <b>seeking</b> <b>comment.</b> Leach's rant will likely draw a fine from the league and possibly a suspension." ...|$|E
