5000|$|The {{conductivity}} of such polymers is {{the result}} of several processes. For example, in traditional polymers such as polyethylenes, the valence electrons are bound in sp3 hybridized covalent bonds. Such [...] "sigma-bonding electrons" [...] have low mobility and do not contribute to the electrical conductivity of the material. However, in conjugated materials, the situation is completely different. Conducting polymers have backbones of contiguous sp2 hybridized carbon centers. One valence electron on each center resides in a pz orbital, which is orthogonal to the other three <b>sigma-bonds.</b> All the pz orbitals combine with each other to a molecule wide delocalized set of orbitals. The electrons in these delocalized orbitals have high mobility when the material is [...] "doped" [...] by oxidation, which removes some of these delocalized electrons. Thus, the conjugated p-orbitals form a one-dimensional electronic band, and the electrons within this band become mobile when it is partially emptied. The band structures of conductive polymers can easily be calculated with a tight binding model. In principle, these same materials can be doped by reduction, which adds electrons to an otherwise unfilled band. In practice, most organic conductors are doped oxidatively to give p-type materials. The redox doping of organic conductors is analogous to the doping of silicon semiconductors, whereby a small fraction silicon atoms are replaced by electron-rich, e.g., phosphorus, or electron-poor, e.g., boron, atoms to create n-type and p-type semiconductors, respectively.|$|E

The calculations show that the protonation should occur at the metal center, giving a coordinately unsaturated five-coordinate Pt(IV) hydride which is trapped by acetonitrile; otherwise monophenyl solvento cations (N-N) Pt(Ph) (NCMe) (+) should be isolated and characterized spectroscopically. Of the H exchange process, oxidative addition-reductive elimination and <b>sigma-bond</b> metathesis mechanisms (including direct <b>sigma-bond</b> metathesis and indirect <b>sigma-bond</b> metathesis) are considered. The indirect <b>sigma-bond</b> metathesis, which goes through a two-step H migration, is dramatically higher in energy {{than that of the}} direct one, so we can safely rule it out. The barrier associated with direct <b>sigma-bond</b> metathesis is 14. 70 kcal/mol, to be compared with 20. 56 kcal/mol found in oxidative addition. So, unlike the methane C-H activation, the direct <b>sigma-bond</b> metathesis pathway is predicted to take place predominantly. Furthermore, the solvent-induced associative elimination of benzene is also confirmed by the current theoretical studies for the first time. The trigonal bipyramidal transition states offer substantial evidence for this process, and the principle of microscopic reversibility then implies that benzene coordination will also be a solvent-assisted, associative process for a C-H activation reaction. For the different rates of benzene elimination, our calculations show that nucleophiles with higher electron-donating abilities and small steric effects of the diimine ligands will favor elimination greatly...|$|R

In a one-to-one correspondence between pi and tangential molecular orbitals of a cycle, local rotation turns each d to a tangential basis function, changing bonding interactions to antibonding and inverting the order of filling of molecular orbitals. The ipsocentric ring-current mapping approach is used to evaluate aromaticity on the magnetic criterion.

40|$|The {{chemical}} {{manifestations of}} orbital interactions through four <b>sigma-bonds</b> in the base-induced and -directed reactions of monosulfonated tratis-perhydronaphthalene- and norbornane- 1, 4 -diols are discussed. Through-bond interactions (TBI) and sigma-participation {{are the most}} important stereoelectronic effects which principally determine their reactivity. Dependent on the geometry of the relaying C-C bonds, these compounds react by three chief pathways: rearrangement, elimination, and homofragmentation. Substituents at carbon atoms adjacent to the carbon atom bearing the sulfonate ester group increase the contribution of sigma-participation, which-is expressed in a higher reactivity of these compounds. In cases where the ideal W arrangement is not distorted by alkyl substituents, the co-operation of TBI and sigma- participation results in a fast homofragmentation. Through-space interactions (TSI), if occurring next to TBI, have only a modest influence on the reactivity of these compounds. Secondary monosulfonate esters of rigid 1, 4 -diols do show these typical reactions after induced ionization but the ionization of primary sulfonate esters can not be induced in a similar way. The results obtained from the reactions on monomesylated cholestane- 3, 7 -diols, as model systems for cyclic 1, 5 -diol monosulfonate esters, show that chemical consequences of TBI and sigma-participation still can be observed in these systems, but play only a minor role in their reaction patterns.

The D-B-A compounds under study possess an N,N-dialkylanilino donor and a 1, 1 -dicyanoethene acceptor. The bridge is of the oligo(cyclohex- 1, 4 -diylidene) type (D[3 pi 3]A, D[3 pi 3 pi 3]A and D[3 pi 3 pi 3 pi 3]A), of the oligo(cyclohex- 1, 4 -diyl) type (D[7]A and D[11]A), or of a mixed type (D[3 pi 7]A and D[7 pi 3]A). The bridge topology is indicated between brackets (in D[3 pi 7]A, donor and acceptor are separated by 3 <b>sigma-bonds,</b> one pi-bond and 7 <b>sigma-bonds).</b> Efficient intramolecular triplet-triplet energy transfer from the N,N-dialkylanilino chromophore to the alkene was observed in 1 -phenyl- 4 -cyclohexylidenepiperidine (D[3 pi 3]) and 4 -[4 -(propan- 2 -ylidene) cyclohexyl]-N,N-dimethylaniline (D[4 pi 1]) (Chapter 2).

In Paper II we expand the model Hamiltonian to treat the revolution of phenylene rings around the <b>sigma-bonds</b> and demonstrate the great impact of stochastic ring torsion on the intra-chain mobility in conjugated polymers using poly[phenylene vinylene] (PPV) as a model system. Finally, in Paper III we go beyond the original purpose of the methodology and utilize its great flexibility to study radiationless relaxations of hot excitons.

Chapter 1 : This chapter provides a {{brief review of}} the chemistry of metal catalyzed C-C sigma-bond activation reactions. Literature examples for a variety of methods to activate C-C <b>sigma-bonds</b> and their limitations are discussed in detail. Introduction to C-CN sigma-bond reaction and its advantages over the typical C-C sigma-bond activation reactions are discussed with literature examples. Motivation for the current work is also presented. Chapter 2 : Presented herein development of new reaction methodology, intramolecular cyanoesterification of alkynes to synthesize highly functionalized butenolides. The reaction proceeds with commonly used palladium catalyst (Pd(PPh 3) 4) under microwave conditions in five minutes. The reaction tolerates wide variety of substrates and corresponding results are presented. Plausible mechanistic hypothesis is also discussed. Chapter 3 : Presented herein new methodology for intramolecular cyanoacylation of alkenes to synthesize highly functionalized indanones. The major challenge of decarbonylation has been overcome using iminonitriles. The reaction proceeds in the presence of commonly used palladium catalyst (Pd(PPh 3) 4) and very common Lewis acid ZnCl 2. The reaction tolerates wide variety of substrates and corresponding results are presented. Results of mechanistic study of the reaction and plausible mechanism are also presented. Chapter 4 : Presented herein our attempt towards development of intramolecular azidocyanation of alkenes using carbamoyl azides. Interestingly instead of azidoacylation product, 2 -quinazolinone was isolated by the loss of CH 2 and N 2. Future work on optimization and applications of this interesting reaction are discussed...|$|E

50|$|In {{some cases}} of {{multiple}} bonds between two atoms, {{there is no}} net <b>sigma-bonding</b> at all, only pi bonds. Examples include diiron hexacarbonyl (Fe2(CO)6), dicarbon (C2), and diborane(2) (B2H2). In these compounds the central bond consists only of pi bonding because of a sigma antibond accompanying the sigma bond itself. These compounds {{have been used as}} computational models for analysis of pi bonding itself, revealing that in order to achieve maximum orbital overlap the bond distances are much shorter than expected.|$|R
5000|$|The 2-norbornyl cation {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{examples}} of a non-classical ion. Non-classical ions can be defined as organic cations in which electron density of a filled bonding orbital is shared over three or more centers and contains some <b>sigma-bond</b> character. The 2-norbornyl cation is seen as the prototype for non-classical ions. Other simple cations such as protonated acetylene (ethynium, [...] ), protonated ethylene (ethenium, [...] ), and protonated ethane (ethanium, [...] ) have been shown to be best described as non-classical through infrared spectroscopy.|$|R
