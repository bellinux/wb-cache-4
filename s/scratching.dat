5|$|DJ Hero 2 is {{the sequel}} to DJ Hero, a spinoff of the Guitar Hero series. DJ Hero 2 was {{developed}} by FreeStyleGames, published by Activision and released worldwide in October 2010 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii consoles. Like its predecessor, DJ Hero 2 simulates turntablism, the playing of two songs in mix, using a special turntable-based controller that includes the ability to crossfade between the two songs, and <b>scratching</b> the recording. Players are challenged to match these actions, shown through on-screen scrolling indicators in synchronization with the mix; correct actions boost the player's score, while correctly performing several consecutive actions can increase the player's scoring multiplier. Specifically marked sections of songs allow the player to freestyle through crossfading, <b>scratching,</b> or inserting music samples into the mix. The player is not penalized for failing to perform actions. The goal is to obtain a high score for each mix, earning the player a star rating from one to five, which helps to advance the player's progress through the game.|$|E
40|$|Variation in the <b>scratch</b> {{behaviour}} of polymers with {{incorporation of}} different types and amounts of fillers was investigated {{both in terms of}} <b>scratch</b> visibility and <b>scratch</b> hardness. <b>Scratch</b> tests were carried out by a microscratch tester. The effect of fillers on the <b>scratch</b> deformation mode and hence on <b>scratch</b> visibility was evaluated by examining recorded penetration depth and acoustic emission traces together with optical microscope images of the groove left on the surface. <b>Scratch</b> hardness was determined by using a recently proposed <b>scratch</b> model. Adequacy of the model to interpret the local phenomenon induced by addition of fillers was questioned. It was demonstrated that incorporation of hard fillers can enhance the <b>scratch</b> hardness of polymers as well as their basic mechanical properties but leads to an increase in <b>scratch</b> visibility due to a change in <b>scratch</b> deformation mode from ductile ploughing to a brittle failure with crack formation. On the contrary, addition of soft fillers causes a reduction in <b>scratch</b> hardness but it also reduces <b>scratch</b> visibility since it improves the recovery characteristics of the polymer...|$|R

5|$|In many species, fleas are principally a {{nuisance}} to their hosts, causing an itching sensation {{which in turn}} causes the host to try to remove the pest by biting, pecking or <b>scratching.</b> Fleas are not simply a source of annoyance, however. Flea bites cause a slightly raised, swollen itching spot to form; this has a single puncture point at the centre, like a mosquito bite. Besides this, the eczematous itchy skin disease flea allergy dermatitis is common in many host species, including dogs and cats. The bites often appear in clusters or lines of two bites, and can remain itchy and inflamed for up to several weeks afterwards. Fleas can lead to hair loss {{as a result of}} frequent <b>scratching</b> and biting by the animal, and can cause anemia in extreme cases.|$|E

30|$|Surface <b>scratches</b> {{of various}} {{features}} were artificially generated and damaged with UV laser. The effect of <b>scratches</b> on laser damage was investigated there. It is {{found that the}} morphologies vary from <b>scratches</b> depending on the orientation of <b>scratches</b> relative to crystals. That in 90 ° direction is full of micro-cracks while the <b>scratch</b> in 0 °direction contains few micro-cracks. The causes are the anisotropy of KDP. All the laser damage thresholds of <b>scratches</b> are much lower than <b>scratch</b> free surface, but no obvious dependence of the LIDT on the <b>scratch</b> morphology is found. Moreover, the numerical simulation of light intensity shows that cross-section shape of <b>scratches</b> also influences the local electrical field of incident laser light. <b>Scratches</b> with smaller width-to-depth ratio enhance laser light intensity more significantly and more harmful to the improvement of laser damage threshold of KDP. The {{results suggest that the}} mechanical <b>scratches</b> must be avoided to achieve high-quality surface of strong resistance to UV laser pulses, especially those with smaller width-to-depth ratios.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} rock art sites containing <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs in the Bennett Hills, Idaho. Despite their research potential, <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs have received little attention in rock art research or literature. This study contributes valuable data to <b>scratched</b> rock art {{research and the}} corpus of rock art research in general. Two samples of ten <b>scratched</b> petroglyph sites were examined and recorded {{for a total of}} twenty petroglyph sites. Using formal and contextual research methods, multiple attributes of <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs are identified and analyzed. The formal qualities of <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs are examined to define the extent and to characterize the motif assemblage. Formal qualities were also studied to test hypotheses concerning the relationship between <b>scratched</b> and pecked petroglyph styles and associations between <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs and other archaeological phenomena. The contexts of <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs are studied on site and landscape scales to identify correlations with other archaeological phenomena and environments. The formal analyses revealed that there are more <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs in the Bennett Hills than records and literature currently indicate. Few site records document the presence of <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs, although {{as a result of this}} analysis it appears to be ubiquitous in the Bennett Hills. It is possible that <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs are under recorded in other locales as well, and that further investigations may identify a greater frequency of <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs throughout the Great Basin. Proper identification of <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs may alter how these properties are evaluated and in turn how they are managed. The Bennett Hills encompass a limited and unique assemblage of <b>scratched</b> petroglyph motifs that are dissimilar to petroglyphs manufactured using other techniques. This is significant in that it helps support the idea that <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs are distinct. Rather than just an alternative method to pecking, <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs serve a unique function that is different from and independent of pecked petroglyphs. Contextual analyses indicated that <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs are located in patterned and significant associations with artifacts, features, environments, and landscapes. The contextual analysis suggested that <b>scratched</b> rock art was produced in a public context in close proximity to subsistence related activities, perhaps in association with resource gathering events. There are various hypotheses that deal with the interaction between <b>scratched</b> and pecked petroglyph styles. <b>Scratched</b> petroglyphs occur both independent of and in association with other pecked petroglyph styles, although <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs do not commonly occur with any one pecked motif. When <b>scratched</b> and pecked petroglyph styles overlap <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs are always later than and superimposed over earlier pecked petroglyphs. Data was collected to test three hypotheses concerning the intention of association between <b>scratched</b> and pecked petroglyphs. It does not appear that <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs serve to obliterate earlier pecked petroglyphs or function as a sketch that would be pecked later. There is evidence that some <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs enhance earlier pecked petroglyphs however, this hypothesis cannot sufficiently describe the range of patterns and associations found in the Bennett Hills <b>scratched</b> petroglyph assemblage. Hypotheses suggesting associations between <b>scratched</b> rock art and other archaeological phenomena were also examined. The association between <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs and <b>scratched</b> stones is deserving of further research. It may also be too soon to dismiss the association between <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs and quartz. The examination of <b>scratched</b> petroglyphs in the Bennett Hills provides a unique insight into the minds of the makers of these petroglyphs, contributing valuable data our knowledge of the prehistoric peoples of the Bennett Hills and surrounding areas...|$|R

The <b>scratches</b> {{were characterized}} with varied depth, directions and shapes. The morphology of <b>scratches</b> in different directions is quite different resulting from anisotropy of KDP crystals. The <b>scratched</b> surface along with surfaces free of <b>scratches</b> were irradiated with a 355  nm pulsed laser to acquire the damage threshold of KDP.

Comparing the LIDTs of <b>scratches</b> in different depth, directions and shapes, no significant difference is observed, however. In addition, the experimental phenomena are interpreted by modelling the light field around the <b>scratches</b> with 2 -D FDTD.|$|R

40|$|As part of {{a larger}} effort to {{understand}} the fundamental knowledge of polymer <b>scratch</b> behavior, this dissertation is focused on both experimental study and numerical analysis of <b>scratch</b> deformation of a broad range of polymers, with an emphasis on the mechanical understanding of how the scratch-induced damage is formed. An instrumented progressive load <b>scratch</b> method recommended by ASTM/ISO standards was adopted for the experimental work. The commercial finite element (FE) method package ABAQUS was employed as a numerical simulation tool to describe the stress-strain fields, and it analyzes the deformation mechanisms during the <b>scratch</b> process. A thorough parametric study has been performed to assess the influence of material parameters and surface properties, such as Young's modulus, yield strength, and friction coefficient, on the polymer <b>scratch</b> behavior. Upon investigation of the <b>scratch</b> behaviors of a broad range of polymer materials, various kinds of <b>scratch</b> damage features are identified and correlated with the mechanical characteristics of the polymers. A generalized <b>scratch</b> damage mechanism map for polymers is presented. Correlation between different material types and <b>scratch</b> damage mechanisms is made.
