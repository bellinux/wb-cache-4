25|$|Robinson {{remained}} in the Seanad for four more years, although at this point {{many of the issues}} she had campaigned for had been tackled. Contraception had been legalised although heavily restricted, women were on juries, and the marriage bar on women in the civil service had been revoked. To the surprise of many, she decided not to seek re-election to the senate in 1989. One year later, however, Labour approached her about running for president in that year's election. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> being asked her legal advice about the type of policy programme party leader Dick Spring was proposing. However, as she read the briefing notes, she began to realise that the programme was aimed at her. After some consideration, she agreed to become the first Labour nominee for the presidency and the first woman candidate in what was only the second presidential election to be contested by three candidates since 1945.|$|E
25|$|Hurd-Wood {{attended}} Rodborough Technology College in Milford, Surrey from 2001 to 2006 for her GCSEs with Art, English Literature, Psychology and Philosophy as subjects. She had tutored lessons {{during the}} filming of Peter Pan in Australia during 2002 to 2003 as her work lasted for a span of 8 to 9 months. She later attended sixth-form Godalming College from 2006 to 2008 to study for her GCE Advanced Levels with Art, Psychology and Philosophy as subjects. Hurd-Wood had considered becoming a marine biologist because of her love for dolphins. She gave up on the idea when she discovered that it would require studying science because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{not very good at}} it. She became interested in working with children who have special needs or disabilities. Hurd-Wood studied linguistics from 2008 at University College London, having completed her first year in 2009, but left the course incomplete before travelling to Australia for the filming of Tomorrow, When the War Began, when she decided to focus entirely on her career in acting.|$|E
25|$|Stewart {{continued}} her stellar play in her sophomore year; her coaches {{noticed that she}} was demanding the ball more often, something she occasionally did as a freshman, but usually only if <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> playing well. By {{the end of her}} sophomore year, she was named the American Athletic Conference Player of the Year in the league's first season after the split of the original Big East Conference, an honor she would go on to win the following two seasons. Additionally, she was named AP Player of the Year, only the third time in history a sophomore had claimed the honor. The other two sophomore recipients were UConn's Maya Moore and Oklahoma's Courtney Paris. Stewart started and played in all 40 games of 2013â€“2014 season. She led the team at 19.4 points and 2.8 blocks per game, was second on the team with 8.1 rebounds per contest, and fourth on the squad at 49.7 percent shooting and her 291 field goals made was the third-highest single-season total in UConn annals. Her 324 boards marked the 12th-highest single-season total in school history, and her 110 rejections was the third-highest mark.|$|E

50|$|All seems {{well with}} the couple engaged to be married. However, in a cruel twist of fate Yi Feng shows his true colours and {{is not at all}} what Mei Le <b>thought</b> him to <b>be.</b> When <b>she</b> finds out that their {{relationship}} isn't as pure as <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> set with the difficult task of rediscovering herself (with some help!) and in the process, learns to trust and fall in love again.|$|R
2500|$|Addams {{spent her}} {{childhood}} playing outdoors, reading indoors, and attending Sunday school. When she was four she contracted tuberculosis of the spine, known as Potts's disease, which caused a curvature in her spine and lifelong health problems. This made it complicated {{as a child}} to function with the other children, considering she had a limp and could not run as well. As a child, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> [...] "ugly" [...] and later remembered wanting not to embarrass her father, when {{he was dressed in}} his Sunday best, by walking down the street with him.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Let It Be version of the song, Lennon can be heard jokingly saying [...] "Sweet Loretta Fart (often misheard as [...] "fat", due to Lennon's pronunciation), <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a cleaner, but she was a frying pan." [...] The album version of the song also ends with him famously quipping [...] "I'd like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves, and I hope we passed the audition". (Originally he said {{that at the end of}} the rooftop concert, but Phil Spector edited it into the [...] "Get Back" [...] song on the Let It Be album.) ...|$|E
2500|$|An Nanba {{was born}} in Tokyo on March 7, 1984. She says she was very {{outgoing}} as a high-school student and looked much older than her age. She had met scouts from the AV industry often but only decided to begin an AV career after she was robbed and needed the money. She had done some gravure model work for Bejean {{a few months before}} and <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> again doing photographs for a magazine and was shocked when she realized it was a video shoot. The title of her debut video, Number.1!, released in October 2002 by Moodyz when she was 18, is a play on her name (in Japanese name order, Nanba An sounds close to English [...] "Number One").|$|E

50|$|Barbara and her husband, Mike Kenny, {{have three}} sons, Theo, Josh and Billy. Theo <b>was</b> {{so named because}} <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> would <b>be</b> unable to have {{children}} after suffering a miscarriage.|$|R
2500|$|Doping was {{widespread}} at the 2003 USA Championships. A {{year after the}} competition, hurdler Brenda Taylor revealed she was offered banned substance modafinil and claimed that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> [...] "the only person that didn't take it". This followed the revelation that several athletes had tested positive for that drug at the championships and received bans from the sport, including Kelli White, Chryste Gaines, Sandra Glover and Eric Thomas and John McEwen. The governing body USA Track & Field was criticised for not acting more quickly in reporting the failed tests. Despite the failed drug test, the American body failed to report this to the International Association of Athletics Federations until after she had won gold medals in both the 100m and 200m at the World Championships.|$|E
2500|$|Her father wasn't {{completely}} {{supportive of}} her basketball interest, calling her {{in from the}} neighbor's basketball hoop, telling her, [...] "Basketball won't take you anywhere. Come in and do your algebra." [...] Tara was equally certain that algebra wasn't {{going to take her}} anywhere. Her family moved to Niagara Falls in her sophomore year in high school. The house in West Hill had a gravel driveway, making a basketball hoop impractical, but when her parents got her a hoop for Christmas when they were in Niagara Falls. By then, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> too old for basketball, although she would take it up again after she transferred to Buffalo Seminary, an all-girls college preparatory school, in her junior year. She ended up earning a place in the Buffalo Seminary's Athletic Hall of Fame.|$|E
2500|$|These {{delusions}} {{appear to}} have started in 1832 with the [...] "low fever" [...] and the conviction that {{she was part of}} the Trinity, and they continued {{for the rest of her}} life. During the full moon at Broadwater she was observed by worried neighbours to dress in white and to drive the same route in her yellow carriage ritually: past the old Sussex Pad Inn (now replaced with a hotel), over Old Shoreham Bridge, and back home again." [...] <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> the Bride of Christ and that Judgement Day would occur in her lavishly-prepared Hyde Park drawing room. She would talk to her friend Louisa Little, her niece Mrs Cook who noted Ann's sayings in a diary, and to servants and tradesmen, about her religious beliefs, but would close the discussion if rebuffed. She would allow sermons to be read to her, and did not attend church; however she paid for a vault at Broadwater and Worthing Cemetery for the interment of Simm Smith and herself.|$|E

50|$|Sepulveda {{told the}} New York Post that, after earning her MBA, {{she decided to}} work in law enforcement, not finance, because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> would <b>be</b> more able {{to help people in}} law enforcement.|$|R

2500|$|During the episode, Ziva tells {{a witness}} {{that she and}} Tony shared a hotel room, and that she took the couch so she wouldn't have to hear Tony whine about his back. Tony in turn tells McGee that he took the couch. Ziva asks him why he lied and he returns the question. There was much {{speculation}} {{on the part of}} fans about whether the characters might have shared more than was divulged, but Weatherly said in response, [...] "The truth of what happened is probably something that can be discovered inside the episode itself. If you really listen to what they say, I think it is pretty clear what happened: Nothing." [...] He clarified that Tony and Ziva had [...] "a tremendous amount of fun" [...] in Paris and that, [...] "Ziva had more fun with Tony than <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> going to have, which maybe shocked her a little bit, because she was so angry at him after he killed her boyfriend last year." [...] Cote de Pablo added, [...] "Michael has his views of what happened in Paris. I have mine. We haven't discussed it. But all I can say is it was good." [...] Shortly afterwards, Glenn Diaz from BuddyTV reported that the cast was divided on whether or not the characters should be allowed to progress beyond [...] "unfulfilled sexual tension".|$|E
2500|$|She {{rang the}} wall-crank phone two times before being shot {{twice in the}} face from the same window. One bullet entered her right cheek and exited behind her left ear. The other went in her lower jaw just below the lip, {{breaking}} it and splintering out several teeth before lodging under her tongue. She dropped to her knees but soon managed to get on her feet. She ran to get a pistol from the living room, but she was blinded by her own blood. She heard the killer tearing loose the rusted screen wire on the back porch. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> going to be killed, so she stumbled toward her bedroom {{near the front of}} the house to leave a note. Meanwhile, the killer ran to the back of the house and made his way up the steps and into the side-screened porch through the back screen door. She heard the killer coming through the kitchen window, so she turned around and ran through the dining room, through the bedroom, down a hallway, through another bedroom, and then into the living room and out the front door, leaving behind a [...] "virtual river of blood" [...] and teeth throughout the house and across the street. Barefooted and still in her blood-soaked nightgown, she ran across the street to her sister and brother-in-law's house. Since no one was home, she ran 50yards more to A. V. Prater's house. Prater answered her call for help. She gasped, [...] "Virgil's dead", then collapsed. Prater shot a rifle in the air to summon another neighbor, Elmer Taylor. Prater called to Taylor to bring his car because Mr. and Mrs. Starks had been shot. Taylor, along with Mr. and Mrs. Prater and their baby, rode with Mrs. Starks to Michael Meagher Hospital (now Miller County Health Unit) at 503 Walnut Street. Mrs. Starks gave Mr. Taylor, the driver, one of her teeth with a gold filling. She was in a semi-conscious state, slumping forward on the front seat. Although she lost a considerable amount of blood, she showed no signs of going into shock and her heart rate remained normal. Miller County Sheriff W. E. Davis, who became head of the investigation, questioned Mrs. Starks in the operating room at Michael Meagher Hospital. The news was printed on the front page the next morning, on Saturday May 4, reading [...] "MURDER ROCKS CITY AGAIN; FARMER SLAIN, WIFE WOUNDED". Four days later, Sheriff Davis talked with Mrs. Starks again at the hospital. Mrs. Starks discounted a rumor that was circulating about Virgil hearing a car outside his home several nights in a row, fearing of being killed.|$|E

60|$|And Mary {{obtained}} a dreamy soothed submission, so that <b>she</b> almost <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> brushing her victim {{to sleep in}} her chair, before the maid {{came up with the}} viands that Dr. May had ordered.|$|R
50|$|Arnold has a daughter, Alijah Kai Haggins (born March 16, 2004), {{with music}} {{producer}} Carvin Haggins. In {{an interview with}} Joan Rivers, Arnold revealed that <b>she</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> unable to conceive after bouts with endometriosis.|$|R

6000|$|... "No; {{at least}} not so far as I have heard of. Mary {{said that they were}} talking together, and {{something}} was said about Miss Carne's murder; that your daughter turned very pale, and that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> going to faint." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 1975 interview, Welch said <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> had <b>been</b> [...] "good" [...] in Kansas City Bomber, Myra Breckenridge and The Last of Sheila [...] "but {{being good}} in a bad movie doesn't do {{anything}} for your career." ...|$|R
50|$|Caro {{found the}} Cannes Film Festival to <b>be</b> {{different}} from what <b>she</b> <b>thought.</b> <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> would <b>be</b> mingling with other filmmakers and discussing other films, but the festival is only a market and is very cut-throat.

50|$|While Andrew Curtin was {{carrying}} Catherine E. Davidson, she gave Curtin her ring. Catherine E. Davidson {{gave him the}} ring because <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> going to die and wanted to thank Andrew Curtin for carrying her to the ambulance.|$|R

6000|$|... 'I {{am not a}} fellow; I am a young lady!' {{said the}} Darning-needle; but no one heard. The sealing-wax had gone, and she had become quite black; but black makes one look very slim, and so <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> even finer than before.|$|E
60|$|She {{very nearly}} {{had a chance}} to fight or fly; for just as they were {{preparing}} to leave the table, a sudden sneeze nearly undid her. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> lost, and hid her face, expecting to be dragged out--to instant death, perhaps--by the wrathful men of war.|$|E
