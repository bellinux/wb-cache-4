Octopus arms do not become tangled or stuck to each other because the sensors recognise octopus skin and prevent self-attachment.|$|E
5|$|The {{inspection}} robot of the European project Robair, funded from 2001 to 2003, {{is designed}} to mount on the wings and fuselage of an aircraft to inspect rows of rivets. To move, the robot uses a flexible network of pneumatic <b>suction</b> <b>cups</b> that are adjustable to the surface. It can inspect the lines of rivets with ultrasonic waves, eddy current and thermographic techniques. It detects loose rivets and cracks.|$|E

25|$|The {{root system}} of Pinguicula species is {{relatively}} undeveloped. The thin, white roots serve mainly as an anchor {{for the plant}} and to absorb moisture (nutrients are absorbed through carnivory). In temperate species these roots wither (except in P. alpina) when the hibernaculum is formed. In the few epiphytic species (such as P. lignicola), the roots form anchoring <b>suction</b> <b>cups.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some limbless animals, such as leeches, have <b>suction</b> <b>cups</b> {{on either}} end of their body, which allow them to move by {{anchoring}} the rear end and then moving forward the front end, which is then anchored and then the back end is pulled in, and so on. This is known as two-anchor movement. A legged animal, the inchworm, also moves like this, clasping with appendages at {{either end of}} its body.|$|E
25|$|Rubber was {{introduced}} to Europe and America and created a shift in shoes from the pattens and clogs to the galosh. The galosh was soft and gummy in warm weather and hard and stiff in the cold. The style of men's shoes closely mirrored that of women's, as they were narrow, heelless slippers with low-cut vamps. They were very flimsy looking, {{as though they were}} held on by <b>suction</b> <b>cups,</b> for the leather barely covered the toes and hardly gripped the heel.|$|E

25|$|Where {{the foot}} is {{important}} to the legged mammal, for limbless animals the underside of the body is important. Some animals such as snakes or legless lizards move on their smooth dry underside. Other animals have various features that aid movement. Molluscs such as slugs and snails move on a layer of mucus that is secreted from their underside, reducing friction and protecting from injury when moving over sharp objects. Earthworms have small bristles (setae) that hook into the substrate and help them move. Some animals, such as leeches, have <b>suction</b> <b>cups</b> on either end of the body allowing two anchor movement.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{coercion}} {{can lead}} to sexual dimorphisms, in which males and females have significant morphological differences. For example, in some species, larger males are more successful in forcefully mating/insemination, leading to a higher fitness. In red-sided garter snakes, Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis, {{it has been shown}} that heavier-bodied males were better courters and their size gave them an advantage over smaller bodied snakes. This helps lead to an evolution of sexual dimorphism, with males larger than females. In other species, males that are smaller than females have higher fitness. Basically, many sex-specific morphological adaptations (for example, in Dytiscidae diving beetles, females have setose dorsal furrows that males do not and males have <b>suction</b> <b>cups</b> on their forelegs that females do not) are sexual dimorphisms caused by sexual coercion.|$|E
500|$|When {{longitudinal}} {{muscles in}} the ampullae contract, valves in the lateral canals close and water is forced into the tube feet. These extend to contact the substrate. Although the tube feet resemble <b>suction</b> <b>cups</b> in appearance, the gripping action {{is a function of}} adhesive chemicals rather than suction. [...] Other chemicals and relaxation of the ampullae allow for release from the substrate. The tube feet latch on to surfaces and move in a wave, with one arm section attaching to the surface as another releases. Some starfish turn up the tips of their arms while moving which gives maximum exposure of the sensory tube feet and the eyespot to external stimuli.|$|E

40|$|Porous cups {{are widely}} used to extract soil water for {{monitoring}} solute transport. However, {{it is not yet}} clear how the <b>suction</b> <b>cup</b> influences the matric potential in the surrounding soil and which part of the soil is sampled. This research was designed to numerically evaluate the activity domain, the extraction domain, and sampling area of a <b>suction</b> <b>cup</b> under constant infiltration. A finite- element model (HYDRUS- 2 D) was used to simulate the effect of various applied suctions at two infiltration rates on the water status in three soils (clay loam, sandy clay, and sand). Particle tracking was used to track the streamlines that define the sampling area and extraction of the <b>suction</b> <b>cup.</b> In general, the activity domain, the extracdomain, and sampling area of the <b>suction</b> <b>cup</b> depend primarily on the soil hydraulic parameters and the upper boundary, and secondarily on the applied suction. Results showed that the activity domain, the extraction domain, and the sampling area are largest for highest ambient hydraulic conductivities. The activity domain and the sampling area also decrease with increasing infiltration rates. Further, the activity domain of the <b>suction</b> <b>cup</b> depends strongly on the duration of water extraction. Soil heterogeneity seems to play a minor role with respect to the activity domain and sampling area of the cup...|$|R

500|$|On August 9, 2016, a man {{posted a}} YouTube video that {{subsequently}} went viral, {{in which he}} said that he was an independent researcher wishing to speak to Donald Trump. The next day, a man, suspected to be the same man who had posted the YouTube video, climbed the outside of Trump Tower from the 5th to the 21st floors. The man was aid climbing using industrial <b>suction</b> <b>cups.</b> During the incident, the police attempted to [...] "safely isolate" [...] the climber, breaking and removing windows to try to capture him. After climbing for 2 hours and 45 minutes, he was apprehended by the NYPD Emergency Service Units (ESU) at the 21st floor of the tower. The man identified himself as Stephen Rogata, a 20-year-old Virginia resident. Rogata was arrested for endangerment and criminal trespassing and taken to Bellevue Hospital for psychiatric evaluation.|$|E
500|$|It was Johnson who {{suggested}} the creature {{should be a}} shapeshifter, having used the idea in an episode of The Twilight Zone he wrote called [...] "The Four of Us Are Dying". The creature was designed by Wah Chang, and dancer Sandra Gimpel wore the costume on-screen. She had previously appeared as a Talosian in [...] "The Cage". The head of the creature costume was sculpted in clay then covered in a plaster cast. Once the cast was removed, liquid latex was applied to create a flexible single-piece mask, which was then painted. Chang added a white wig and attached glass lenses to the mask for eyes. Once Gimpel was wearing the mask, cuts were made into its wrinkles to offer the actress some limited vision while wearing it. Gloves were modified by Chang to give the fingers the appearance of tentacles with <b>suction</b> <b>cups.</b> William Ware Theiss created {{the rest of the}} costume out of a fur bodysuit.|$|E

30|$|This study {{presents}} a finger-triggered portable polydimethylsiloxane <b>suction</b> <b>cup</b> that enables equipment-free microfluidic pumping. The key {{feature of this}} method is that its operation only involves a “pressing-and-releasing” action for the cup placed at the outlet of a microfluidic device, which transports the fluid at the inlet toward the outlet through a microchannel. This method is simple, but effective and powerful. The cup is portable and can easily be fabricated from a three-dimensional printed mold, used without any pre-treatment, reversibly bonded to microfluidic devices without leakage, and applied to various material-based microfluidic devices. The effect of the <b>suction</b> <b>cup</b> geometry and fabrication conditions on the pumping performance was investigated. Furthermore, we demonstrated the practical applications of the <b>suction</b> <b>cup</b> by conducting an equipment-free pumping of thermoplastic-based microfluidic devices and water-in-oil droplet generation.|$|R
