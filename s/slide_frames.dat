5000|$|The {{original}} standard {{color was}} matte black with highly polished <b>slide</b> <b>frames.</b> A complete high polish blued finish or a {{hard chrome plating}} were optional. A factory presentation model was produced with a high polished gold plated slide.|$|E
50|$|The {{first step}} in the process was the removal of the antihalation backing with an {{alkaline}} solution and wash. The film was then developed using a developer containing phenidone and hydroquinone, which formed three superimposed negative images, one for each primary color. After the first developer was washed out, the film underwent re-exposure and redevelopment. Re-exposure fogged the silver halides that were not developed in the first developer. A color developer then developed the fogged image, and its exhaustion products reacted with a color coupler to form a dye in the color complementary to the layer's sensitivity. The red-sensitive layer was re-exposed through the base of the film with red light, then redeveloped forming cyan dye. The blue-sensitive layer was re-exposed through the emulsion side of the film with blue light, then redeveloped forming yellow dye. The green-sensitive layer was redeveloped with a developer that chemically fogged it and formed magenta dye. After color development, the metallic silver was converted to silver halide using a bleach solution. The film was then fixed, making these silver halides soluble and leaving only the final dye image. The final steps were to wash the film to remove residual chemicals which might cause deterioration of the dye image, then to dry, cut, and mount the film in <b>slide</b> <b>frames.</b>|$|E

5000|$|This chalet-type two-storey {{house was}} built in 1932. Unlike any other houses, the facade has a {{striking}} appearance, showing its walls and pediment with geometric designs. A variety of windows can be seen. There is a glass on wood <b>sliding</b> <b>frame</b> window, wood ventanilla w/ metal grills and diagonal metal window grills on the facade with [...] "GM" [...] initials; and capiz on <b>sliding</b> wood <b>frame</b> and metal window grills on the lateral part of the house. Its exterior walls are made of wood panels {{on the front and}} horizontal clapboards on the sides. The house is located at 2233 Dela Rosa Street.|$|R
40|$|Simulation at the machine-control level {{plays an}} {{important}} role in designing machine controls and operational specifications. Recently, there has been a considerable amount of work done in the area of manufacturing systems control. This micro-level type of modeling is as important as modeling at the plant level. This paper is an application case study of modeling at the machine-control level. The objective of this paper is to address the issues of augmenting control design for automated production systems through the use of DES. The case study is an automated process of a frame turnover. In this process, an inbound conveyor transfers large frames into a turnover unit. Frames are accelerated toward the lift and rotate unit using a hydraulic <b>slide.</b> <b>Frames</b> are lifted and rolled over side to side then lowered onto an outbound pedestal conveyor. The pedestal conveyor shifts frames to the unloading station. The objectives of the case study were to visualize the turnover process and to design the sequences and timing of its operations. Based on that, it is required to verify that there is enough time for the turnover process to take place in synch with the movement of the inbound and pedestal conveyors. Finally, the machine controls are designed so that the system throughput and operational specifications are achieved...|$|E
25|$|A current {{production}} Glock 17 {{consists of}} 34 parts. For maintenance, the pistol disassembles into five main groups: the barrel, <b>slide,</b> <b>frame,</b> magazine, and recoil-spring assembly. The firearm {{is designed for}} the NATO-standard 9×19mm Parabellum pistol cartridge, but can use high-power (increased pressure) +P and +P+ ammunition with either full-metal-jacket or jacketed hollow-point projectiles.|$|R
2500|$|The Glock 23 is a [...]40 S {{version of}} the compact Glock 19. It is {{dimensionally}} identical to the Glock 19, but is slightly heavier and uses a modified <b>slide,</b> <b>frame,</b> [...]40 S barrel, and a standard magazine capacity of 13 rounds. The factory 15-round magazine from the larger Glock 22 will function in the Glock 23.|$|R
5000|$|This {{varies from}} the {{transfer}} bench, in {{that instead of}} scooting to the other side, the user {{does not have to}} move their hips across the seat. The user simply sits on a seat and then slides to the other side, usually on rails or some kind of <b>sliding</b> <b>frame.</b> This reduces friction considerably and eases the movement for more highly dependent patients.|$|R

50|$|There is a fenced {{playground}} {{with safety}} surface containing swings, <b>slides,</b> climbing <b>frames,</b> spring toys and seating.|$|R
50|$|Its {{strength}} lies in {{the somewhat}} sloppy fitting between <b>slide</b> and <b>frame,</b> securing reliability even after 2000 rounds without cleaning.|$|R
25|$|The {{compensator}} cuts start {{about halfway}} {{back on the}} top of the barrel. The two rear cuts are narrower than the two front cuts. The slide is hollowed, or dished-out, in a rectangular pattern between the rear of the ejection port and the rear sight. The rate of fire in fully automatic mode is around 1,100–1,200 rounds per minute. Most of the other characteristics are equivalent to the Glock 17, although the <b>slide,</b> <b>frame,</b> and certain fire-control parts of the Glock 18 are not interchangeable with other Glock models.|$|R
2500|$|The 92A1 and 96A1 [...] were {{introduced}} in 2010, based on elements from the 92FS and 90two. The overall shape and styling builds on the 92FS with more parts commonality than the 90-two had. From the 90-two comes a heavier slide construction combined with a slightly altered frame to accommodate the picatinny rail and [...]40 S power levels. While most internal components are compatible with standard 92 models, the <b>slide,</b> <b>frame,</b> captive recoil spring assembly, and takedown lever and button of the 92A1 and 96A1 are not interchangeable with other models other than the 90-two.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} analyzing audio signals with an adaptive ``parametric dictionary''. We use <b>sliding</b> <b>frames</b> to extract elementary signals or grains from the anal- ysis signal. We search for similarities amongst the collected grains to form classes, which we then use to derive a signal model for each class. These signal models or prototypes, are used to decompose the audio signal and compute analysis parameters for each grain. As a preliminary evaluation, we tested the method with real-life, monophonic and monaural recordings and obtained encouraging results...|$|R
50|$|Several {{companies}} currently offer upgrades or comprehensive rebuild {{packages for}} AMLs, particularly {{with regards to}} the elderly Panhard Model 4 HD engine, for which spare parts are difficult and expensive to source. Saymar, an Israeli firm, has proposed replacing it with a two-litre Toyota diesel engine developing 76 kW (102 hp). Another extensive AML modernisation programme is being marketed by a subsidiary of the Saudi Military Industries Corporation. Overhauled Saudi AML engines are supported on a horizontal <b>sliding</b> <b>frame,</b> allowing them {{to be replaced by a}} trained maintenance team in twenty minutes.|$|R
5000|$|In 1994, an Eland was showcased with a {{turbocharged}} diesel four-cylinder powerpack developing 103 hp at 4,000 rpm. This {{was mounted}} on a <b>sliding</b> <b>frame</b> to facilitate easier engine removal and maintenance. Apart from the new engine, other changes were made to enhance performance in tropical climates. These included modified air conditioning and cooling systems. Reumech OMC - then a subsidiary of Vickers - marketed the design as Eland Mk7 Diesel Turbocharged, or simply [...] "Eland Mk7 DT". An estimated 200 Mk7s were haggled from the SANDF for diesel conversion.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the out-of-plane {{response}} of infill walls is investigated {{by means of}} non-linear monotonic (push-over) analyses through a combined finite and discrete modelling approach. The model accounts for material deformability, crack formation, sliding, separa-tion and formation of new contacts. Masonry units are modelled as finite elements, and differ-ent material models are assumed for the masonry. Contact between masonry units, and between masonry and frame elements is modelled by means of interfaces, which permit tan-gential motion with frictional <b>sliding.</b> <b>Frame</b> elements are modelled {{by means of a}} linear-elastic material. The results of the numerical analyses are compared with those of experimen-tal tests available in the literature. The advantages and disadvantages of the adopted model-ling strategy are investigated...|$|R
