25|$|Eukaryotic SRP RNAs are {{transcribed}} from DNA by RNA polymerase III (Pol III). RNA polymerase III also transcribes {{the genes}} for 5S ribosomal RNA, tRNA, 7SK RNA, and U6 spliceosomal RNA. The promoters {{of the human}} SRP RNA genes include elements located downstream of the transcriptional start <b>site.</b> <b>Plant</b> SRP RNA promoters contain an upstream stimulatory element (USE) and a TATA box. Yeast SRP RNA genes have a TATA box and additional intragenic promoter sequences (referred to as A- and B-blocks) which {{play a role in}} regulating transcription of the SRP gene by Pol III. In the bacteria, genes are organized in operons and transcribed by RNA polymerase. The 5'-end of the small (4.5S) SRP RNA of many bacteria is cleaved by RNase P. The ends of the Bacillus subtilis SRP RNA are processed by RNase III. So far, no SRP RNA introns have been observed.|$|E

40|$|CO 2 ocean {{disposal}} {{is one of}} several ways proposed to mitigate the greenhouse gas effect. In this paper, we estimate the cost of various CO 2 disposal options. The system consists of a conventional pulverized coal power plant, CO 2 separation using an amine scrubber, liquefaction and transportation. I this investigation, the power plant and the CO 2 separation plant are common. The liquefaction process and transportation systems are different. We evaluate the costs of pipeline, liquid CO 2 tanker for CO 2 lake, liquid CO 2 tanker dispersion, dry ice tanker and CO 2 dispersion by OTEC. The effect of distance between a power plant and the disposal <b>site,</b> <b>plant</b> size, and plant efficiency on the cost for each case is evaluated.
