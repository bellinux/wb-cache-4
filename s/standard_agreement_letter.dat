A qualitative method is applied in searching data of business practices. This study uses a normative research which guides the rule of law or determines some business standards and norms.

(Nonstandard Agreement) Previous studies of subject-verb agreement (Wolfram & Christian 1976; Feagin 1979; Woods 1979; Eisikovits 1991; DeWolf 1992; Meechan & Foley 1994) have found that <b>standard</b> <b>agreement</b> is particularly infrequent in existential constructions. Indeed, existential constructions are typically characterized as triggering high frequencies of nonstandard agreement as in (1 b). Most studies exploring the agreement pattern in existentials, however, have focused on informal speech situations, such as Meechan and Foleys (1994) corpus survey of Ottawa and Nova Scotian English, where speakers are recorded in general interview or casual conversation style situations. Studies of this type find {{a high degree of}} nonstandard agreement. Occasionally, mo...|$|R

As the Malaysian and Singaporean stock markets evolved, the respective regulatory bodies implemented the introduction of <b>standard</b> remisiers' <b>agreements</b> governing the {{relationship between}} all remisiers and member companies in the stockbroking industry (under these <b>standard</b> <b>agreements,</b> the remisier is regarded {{as an agent of}} the stockbroking company to trade in securities {{in the name of the}} company.
