50|$|After {{going through}} a name change, ON Subscription Television's {{broadcast}} signal was secured with a relatively simple analog <b>scrambling</b> <b>method</b> over the UHF spectrum; therefore, it was a popular target for those who chose to pirate the signal. In most U.S. markets where an over-the-air subscription television service operated, viewers could purchase descrambler kits from various specialty retailers or through mail order services advertised in magazines. The increased availability of cable television, coupled with the relative ease of obtaining descramblers contributed to a significant loss of revenue for the service.

This key was easily defeated with a decoder built around an FM stereo demodulator chip known as the LM1800. All of WQTV's subscribers were transitioned to another area subscription television service known as Preview, operated by Time Warner's New England Subscription Television on Worcester's WSMW-TV (channel 27, now WUNI).

50|$|A {{disadvantage}} {{of the original}} NMT specification is that voice traffic was not encrypted, therefore {{it was possible to}} listen to calls using e.g. a scanner. As a result, some scanners have had the NMT bands blocked so they could not be accessed. Later versions of the NMT specifications defined optional analog scrambling which was based on two-band audio frequency inversion. If both the base station and the mobile station supported scrambling, they could agree upon using it when initiating a phone call. Also, if two users had mobile (phone) stations supporting scrambling, they could turn it on during conversation even if the base stations didn't support it. In this case, audio would be scrambled all the way between the 2 mobile stations. While the <b>scrambling</b> <b>method</b> was not at all as strong as encryption of current digital phones, such as GSM or CDMA, it did prevent casual listening with scanners.

The PDL measurements were conducted both in the laboratory and in the field. For field measurements, a buried link (28. 8 km) and an aerial fibre (7. 1 km) were extensively studied. The findings obtained from these studies are very important for network operators who must assess the impact of PDL on the network reliability. The three different PDL measurement methods (JME, OSA and polarization scrambling) were compared and their PDL values were found to agree very well at the selected wavelength of 1550 nm. Concatenation of PDL components showed that as expected, PDL increase as the number of PDL components were added. The interactions between PMD and PDL measurements were analyzed. A PMD/PDL emulator was constructed. We observed that PMD decreased while PDL increased. The PMD decrease was a result of the PMD vector cancellation enhanced by the randomly distributed mode coupling angles while PDL increase was a result of each PM fibre segments contributing to the overall global PDL. It was observed that the presence of PMD in a link containing PDL, results in PDL being wavelength dependent and this resulted in the extraction of the PMD information from the PDL data. PDL was found to be Maxwellian distributed when considering low values of PMD. High PMD values resulted in the PDL distribution deviating from Maxwellian. Long-term PDL and PMD (average DGD) measurements indicated that the PDL and PMD varied slowly with time and wavelength for both the laboratory and field measurements.

Despite his folksy background, general lack of literacy, and what were considered generally vulgar ways, Liu Bang had a great regard for literature and learning. His patronage of literature and the arts, as well as his connections with the unique culture of Chu would set a precedent {{for the rest of the}} dynasty which he founded, and which managed to keep much of the political power in the hands of the Liu family: often this was implemented by allowing Liu family princes a great deal of autonomy in their local areas, thus encouraging the development of subsidiary royal courts, besides the main imperial court; and, in some cases, this encouraged princely patronage of literature and the arts, with some greater diversity and cross-fertilization of artistic genres and styles. Other important features of the Han era include the location of the capital in Chang'an during Western Han, and its move to Luoyang in Eastern Han, the extension of the Han empire into new regions, and contact with new peoples and cultures, a development which was extended by the further explorations by people such as Zhang Qian of the Silk Roads fame who in the 2nd century BC got as far as Bactria and Dayuan (Ferghana, in modern eastern Uzbekistan), and among other things brought back alfalfa and grapes to China. Also important in the history of the Han dynasty is the method of recording words, such as poems. Brushing characters with ink is archeologically attested to during the Han period, including on silk, hemp paper, and bamboo slips. The bamboo (or wood) slips were tied together carefully with delicate string cords. When these rotted and broke, the individual slips would become mixed up, and the text which was written upon them thus have often become <b>scrambled.</b> <b>Methods</b> such as stamping or marking on clay or engraving on stone were also used; and, though relatively durable required fairly elaborate craftsmanship to produce. Little poetry from the Han dynasty survives as originally recorded or published, instead most of the preserved poems exist as passed on to the future by the Six Dynasties poetry era anthologies.|$|R
