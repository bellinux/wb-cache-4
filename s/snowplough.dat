25|$|In this classification, skiers with {{cerebral}} palsy have difficulty walking in ski boots and sometimes require assistance when walking in them. When going up hill, they often have their weaker side on the uphill side. In learning to ski, a ski bra {{is often used to}} teach the proper technique. Skiers sometimes have difficulty with the <b>snowplough</b> technique. In teaching skiers with {{cerebral palsy}}, instructors are encouraged to delay the introduction ski poles as skiers may overgrip them. Use of a ski bra is also encourage as it helps the skier learn correct knee and hip placement. Some skiers {{with cerebral palsy}} have better balance while using skis than they would otherwise. This presents challenges for coaches who are working with the skier. Compared to other skiers in the class, the skier with cerebral palsy may tie more quickly.|$|E
25|$|Three further lots of {{cars were}} obtained, all being open-topped {{vehicles}} with reversed stairs. The first batch was numbered 78 to 83, built by G. F. Milnes, mounted on 21E trucks, with B.T.H. equipment and 2x30 h.p. B.T.H. motors. The second batch was also built by Milnes, {{but these were}} bogie cars mounted on 22E maximum-traction trucks, also with B.T.H. equipment and 2x30 h.p. motors; they were numbered 84 to 89 and were known as the “pony wheel bogies”. The third batch was really {{part of the same}} order as cars numbered 26 to 57, being similar in every respect. At the same time two works cars were obtained; they were no. 1, a water sprinkler and line clearer, and no. 2, a <b>snowplough.</b> Both of these had 21E trucks and 2x35 h.p. Dick, Kerr motors.|$|E
500|$|Turns, used while {{descending}} or for braking, {{include the}} <b>snowplough</b> (or [...] "wedge turn"), the stem christie (or [...] "wedge christie"), parallel turn, and the Telemark turn. The step turn {{is used for}} maintaining speed during descents or out of track on flats.|$|E
50|$|Tb is a {{diesel-electric}} locomotive used by Banverket of Sweden for line service and <b>snowploughing.</b> Ten locomotives were built for Swedish State Railways (Statens Järnvägar, SJ) in 1969-70 by Nydquist & Holm (NOHAB) for combined freight and <b>snowploughing</b> service, along with 20 smaller Tc locomotives. When Banverket was demerged in 1988 the Tb {{were transferred to}} it.|$|R
50|$|Tc is a diesel-hydraulic {{locomotive}} used by Banverket of Sweden for line service and <b>snowploughing.</b> Twenty locomotives were built for Swedish State Railways (Statens Järnvägar, SJ) in 1969-71 by Nydquist & Holm for combined freight and <b>snowploughing</b> service, along with 10 larger Tb locomotives. When Banverket was demerged in 1988 the Tc {{were transferred to}} it. Since 1994 some of the units have {{been taken out of}} service.|$|R

2500|$|During a 2011 {{episode of}} Top Gear, James May drank from an urn of Bovril while driving a <b>snowplough</b> in Norway and commented: [...] "We {{all know that}} when it's snowing and it's cold you have Bovril. [...] That's a rule of life." [...] Bovril reappeared in another episode of Top Gear {{in the form of}} Jeremy Clarkson's V8 Food Blender, wherein it was used to make a [...] "Man's V8 Smoothie" [...] {{complete}} with raw beef and a brick.|$|E
2500|$|Some skiers with {{cerebral}} palsy have better balance while using skis than they would otherwise. This presents challenges for coaches who {{are working with the}} skier. Compared to other skiers in the class, the skier with {{cerebral palsy}} may tire more quickly. In teaching skiers {{with cerebral palsy}}, instructors are encouraged to delay the introduction ski poles as skiers may overgrip them. [...] Use of a ski bra is also encourage as it helps the skier learn correct knee and hip placement. Some skiers with cerebral palsy in this class have difficulty with the <b>snowplough</b> technique.|$|E
5000|$|The Class DD15 was {{developed}} from the Class DD13 locomotive design, {{with the addition of}} <b>snowplough</b> units at either end. The <b>snowplough</b> units could be detached, allowing the locomotives to be used for shunting and other duties outside the winter periods. However, with the <b>snowplough</b> units mounted, the locomotive axle load was nearly 16 t, restricting use on rural lines, and so the class was superseded by the later Class DE15 locomotives, which had separate <b>snowplough</b> units. As with the Class DD13 locomotives, the Class DD15 had two [...] DMF31SB diesel engines.|$|E
50|$|In late 2006, {{all three}} sets {{underwent}} modifications at JR East's Kōriyama Works {{to reinforce the}} front end <b>snowploughs</b> and add protection plates to underfloor equipment.|$|R
50|$|On {{almost all}} the beltway, the speed limit is 90 km/h and filling {{stations}} are present. A regular service of gritters is active during winter, including <b>snowploughs</b> when needed.|$|R
50|$|In 1987 {{the depot}} had an {{allocation}} of Class 08 shunters. The depot also had two <b>snowploughs.</b> Other locomotives usually stabled at the depot included Classes 26, 27, 37 and 47.|$|R
5000|$|Based on {{the earlier}} Class DD13 6th-batch locomotives, the Class DD14 was a single-end-cab design with a rotary <b>snowplough</b> {{unit at the}} cab end. It was the first {{diesel-powered}} rotary <b>snowplough</b> built by JNR. The locomotives had two [...] diesel engines. One engine {{could be used for}} propulsion with the other driving the rotary <b>snowplough</b> unit, giving a snow-clearing capacity of approximately 3,000 tonnes per hour, or the unit could be operated in multiple with a second locomotive allowing both engines to drive the rotary <b>snowplough,</b> giving a snow-clearing capacity of approximately 4,000 tonnes per hour.|$|E
50|$|The Class DE15 was {{developed}} from the Class DE10 locomotive design, {{with the addition of}} separate two-axle <b>snowplough</b> units at either end. The <b>snowplough</b> units could be attached and detached relatively easily, allowing the locomotives to be used for shunting and other duties outside the winter periods, unlike the <b>snowplough</b> units on the earlier Class DD15 locomotives, which were mounted directly onto the locomotives and required a crane to be attached and detached.|$|E
5000|$|Six Class DE15-1000 {{locomotives}} {{were built}} between 1971 and 1973 by Nippon Sharyo using the DML61ZB engine uprated to [...] Locomotive DE15 1002 had a <b>snowplough</b> unit designed for clearing single-track lines, {{while the other}} five locomotives were designed for clearing double-track lines. Initially, the locomotives operated with only one <b>snowplough</b> unit, but locomotives DE15 1002, 1004, and 1006 were subsequently modified with <b>snowplough</b> units at both ends. DE15 1002 was renumbered DE15 2052.|$|E
50|$|These {{sets were}} built {{for use on}} the Kosei Line, due to the heavy amounts of {{snowfall}} in the region. They feature semi automatic doors, <b>snowploughs</b> and improved brakes. Some trains were also transferred to the Sagano Line.|$|R
50|$|In 1987 {{the depot}} had an {{allocation}} of Class 08 shunters and DMU Classes 101, 105 and 107. The depot also had two <b>snowploughs.</b> Other classes usually stabled at the depot included Classes 20, 26, 27, 37 and 47.|$|R
50|$|Inaugurated in 1994, {{the museum}} {{comprises}} 23 standard gauge locomotives, 10 narrow gauge locomotives, 3 <b>snowploughs</b> and 2 steam cranes. 7 of these locomotives are active, {{and are used}} {{on a variety of}} special trains for enthusiasts and other groups.|$|R
50|$|Between 1979 and 1983, four {{locomotives}} (DD16 2, 5, 4, and 13) {{were converted}} at JNR's Nagano and Matto workshops to become self-propelled <b>snowplough</b> units, numbered DD16 301 to 304, {{with the addition}} of bogie <b>snowplough</b> units on either end.|$|E
50|$|Gives {{information}} to <b>snowplough</b> crews. A yellow or white 'V' shape indicates 'lower snowplough', an inverted yellow or white 'V' indicates 'raise snowplough'. These are placed {{to warn the}} crew to raise the <b>snowplough</b> {{so as to avoid}} hitting any obstructions at rail level, such as level crossings/grade crossings.|$|E
5000|$|Six Class DE15-0 {{locomotives}} {{were built}} between 1967 and 1969 by Kisha and Nippon Sharyo. The locomotives {{were based on}} the Class DE10-0 design and were equipped with a [...] engine and train-heating steam generator. Locomotive DE15 3 had a <b>snowplough</b> unit designed for clearing single-track lines, while the other five locomotives were designed for clearing double-track lines. Initially, the locomotives operated with only one <b>snowplough</b> unit, but locomotives DE15 1 to 3 and 6 were subsequently modified with <b>snowplough</b> units at both ends. DE15 3 was renumbered DE15 2053.|$|E
50|$|The 968xxx series (in the {{carriage}} and wagon number series) {{was used for}} departmental locomotives from 1968 onwards. Previously, some former Class 08 shunters that were converted to <b>snowploughs</b> had been numbered in the 966xxx series, but this was discontinued {{and some of these}} locomotives were renumbered into the 968xxx series.|$|R
5000|$|Nine two-car [...] sets (numbered Z1 to Z9) were {{delivered}} to Yamagata depot in 1999, {{ahead of the}} opening of the extension of the Yamagata Shinkansen to [...] in November 1999. During 2001, the original PS105 lozenge-type pantographs were replaced with PS106B single-arm pantographs. <b>Snowploughs</b> were added to the front ends at the same time.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{rural and}} urban bus {{services}} in Britain and Ireland were suspended. Transport for London reported that several bus routes had been [...] "suspended or redirected" [...] due to blocked roads. All buses were cancelled on 2 February after 20 buses slid off the road the previous day. London {{did not have enough}} <b>snowploughs</b> to cope with the widespread problems.|$|R

50|$|Due {{to their}} {{off-road}} capabilities, Unimogs {{can be found}} in jungles, mountains and deserts as military vehicles, fire fighters, expedition campers, and even in competitions like truck trials and Dakar Rally rally raids. In Western Europe, they are commonly used as <b>snowploughs,</b> municipal equipment carriers, agricultural implements, forest ranger vehicles, construction equipment or road-rail vehicles and as army personnel or equipment carriers (in its armoured military version).|$|R
50|$|In 1987, the {{allocation}} of the depot included Classes 20, 26, 27, 37 and 47, and DMU Classes 101 and 104. Meanwhile, Class 08 shunters were also stabled. At that time, the depot had a wheel lathe and two <b>snowploughs.</b> The depot's logo is commonly noted as having been a Scottie dog, however it was more closely reflective of a West Highland White Terrier.|$|R
5000|$|... 52K Consett (54D until 1958) - {{provided}} {{facilities for}} locomotives working {{the lines in}} and out of Consett, (only the former Stanhope & Tyne route remaining for traffic to and from the steelworks by 1980, when the plant finally closed) as well as being allocated <b>snowploughs</b> which were essential in winter due to the town's location being a high fell {{on the edge of the}} Pennines.|$|R

Three two-car sets (N36 to N38) were later modified with some transverse seating, and from 2005, the entire fleet had the original PS104 scissors-type pantographs replaced with PS109 single-arm pantographs. <b>Snowploughs</b> were also {{added to the}} front ends at the same time.|$|R
5|$|On 1 December 2010, {{the bridge}} was closed {{for the first time}} due to heavy snow. After several {{accidents}} meant <b>snowploughs</b> were unable to clear the carriageways, {{the bridge was}} closed in both directions at 6.40a.m. and remained closed for several hours. As part of celebrations of the fiftieth anniversary of the bridge's operation, artist Kate Downie was commissioned to create a print of the bridge and hold an exhibition of works portraying it.|$|R
25|$|Land Rovers (the Series/Defender models) are {{available}} {{in a variety of}} body styles, from a simple canvas-topped pick-up truck to a twelve-seat fully trimmed station wagon. Both Land Rover and out-of-house contractors have offered conversions and adaptations to the basic vehicle, such as fire engines, excavators, 'cherry picker' hydraulic platforms, ambulances, <b>snowploughs,</b> and six-wheel-drive versions, as well as one-off special builds including amphibious Land Rovers and vehicles fitted with tracks instead of wheels.|$|R
