40|$|This paper {{explores the}} use of {{different}} types of <b>sentence</b> <b>bargaining</b> tactics in ten federal district courts. We distinguish between proactive and reactive prosecutorial orientation, and hypothesize that proactive prosecution of upperworld crime is associated with more explicit <b>sentence</b> <b>bargaining</b> than is the reactive prosecution of underworld crime. We present evidence for and explanations of this relationship...|$|R
40|$|Bearing on {{mind the}} idea of the proverb “Justice Delayed is Justice Denied” Macedonian Legislator within the new Code of Criminal Procedure (CPC) has {{introduced}} several legal mechanisms for accelerating the criminal procedure. The most important instruments among them, by all means, are the Guilty Plea and <b>Sentence</b> <b>Bargaining...</b>|$|R
50|$|In charge bargaining, {{defendants}} {{plead guilty}} to a less serious crime than the original charge. In count bargaining, they {{plead guilty to}} a subset of multiple original charges. In <b>sentence</b> <b>bargaining,</b> they plead guilty agreeing in advance what sentence will be given; however, this sentence can still be denied by the judge. In fact bargaining, defendants plead guilty but the prosecutor agrees to stipulate (i.e., to affirm or concede) certain facts that will affect how the defendant is punished under the sentencing guidelines.|$|R
40|$|Plea and <b>sentence</b> <b>bargaining</b> is {{characterized}} by several general features that we might recognize as common {{across a range of}} jurisdictions and procedural traditions. It requires an admission of guilt from the accused; the accused is offered some reward, incentive or advantage, either in exchange for, or {{as a result of the}} plea; and there is some benefit to the criminal justice system – typically the avoidance of a more lengthy and expensive contested trial. The point in the criminal process at which these negotiations are initiated, the personnel involved, and the relative incentives and benefits available will of course differ. In some instances, explicit bargains are struck between prosecutor and defense lawyer; in others, there is direct judicial involvement; and in others, the system benefit may operate as an implicit reward, without any explicit bargaining taking place...|$|R
50|$|According to Italian law, {{a bargain}} doesn't need a guilty plea (in Italy {{there is no}} plea declaration); for this reason, a <b>bargaining</b> <b>sentence</b> is only an {{acceptance}} of the penalty in exchange with the stop of investigation and trial and has no binding cogency in other trials, especially in civil trials in which parts argue of the same facts at the effects of civil liability and in other criminal trials in which are processed the accomplices of the defendant that had requested and got a <b>bargaining</b> <b>sentence.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1991, Juan David Ochoa Vásquez, {{together}} with his brother Jorge Luis, turned themselves in to the Colombian government {{in order to receive}} the benefits of collaborating with the judicial system. Juan David Ochoa negotiated a surrender and was imprisoned in a medium security prison outside Medellín. In January 1996, {{as the result of a}} <b>sentence</b> plea <b>bargain</b> with the state, Juan David Ochoa Vásquez was released from prison after serving five years.|$|R
40|$|After {{initially}} rejecting {{plea bargaining}} as incompatible with their unique mandate, {{the ad hoc}} International Criminal Tribunals are increasingly using plea bargaining {{as a means to}} manage their expanding caseloads. At first they employed only 2 ̆ 7 <b>sentence</b> <b>bargaining,</b> 2 ̆ 7 but recently, in Plavsic, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia permitted 2 ̆ 7 charge bargaining 2 ̆ 7 - agreeing to drop the charge of genocide and to issue a relatively lenient sentence in return for the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s guilty plea on one count of persecution, a crime against humanity. This article examines {{the costs and benefits of}} the use of charge bargaining by international tribunals. First, it shows that charge bargaining may violate the spirit, though not the letter, of the international duty to prosecute and issue proportionate sentences for certain international crimes. Next, it reveals that charge bargaining is not a functional necessity for the international tribunals. Finally, it demonstrates that charge bargaining distorts the historic record generated by the Tribunal. Nonetheless it concludes that charge bargaining is likely here to stay and offers recommendations for making charge bargaining more compatible with the unique functions of international justice...|$|R
40|$|Prosecutors control {{statutory}} ranges {{by selecting}} charges. In addition, prosecutors {{decide whether to}} use or forego special sentencing statutes that carry mandatory minimum penalties higher than the maximum Guidelines sentence that would otherwise apply to the defendant's conduct, as well as statutes that authorize a sentence lower than the minimum Guidelines sentence that would otherwise apply ("safety valve," "substantial assistance," and Rule 35 reductions). By creating these additional provisions and then removing any effective judicial oversight of their application, Congress has expanded the opportunities for prosecutors to decide when {{to opt out of}} the national Guidelines and when to abide by them. Other authors [in this Issue] address whether lawmakers should modify some of these statutory mechanisms that expand the government's unilateral power to select very different punishment ranges for not-so-different cases. This Article will focus instead on the parties' ability to circumvent consistency by bargaining around the rules that structure sentences within statutory ranges. Without careful control by judges, <b>sentencing</b> <b>bargaining</b> carries risks for structured-sentencing systems that may outweigh gains in efficiency. After a discussion of weaknesses in the ability of judges to oversee the factual accuracy of sentencing decisions, this Article advances several options that would strengthen that supervisory role, promoting greater accuracy, transparency, and consistency in federal sentencing...|$|R
5000|$|A {{defendant}} who {{enters a}} {{plea of guilty}} must do so, in the phraseology of a 1938 Supreme Court case, [...] Johnson v. Zerbst, [...] "knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently". The burden is on the prosecution to prove that all waivers of the defendant's rights complied with due process standards. Accordingly, in cases of {{all but the most}} minor offences, the court or the prosecution (depending upon local custom and the presiding judge's preference) will engage in a plea colloquy wherein they ask the defendant a series of rote questions about the defendant's knowledge of his rights and the voluntariness of the plea. Typically the hearing on the guilty plea is transcribed by a court reporter and the transcript is made a part of the permanent record of the case in order to preserve the conviction's validity from being challenged at some future time. [...] "Voluntary" [...] has been described as [...] "an elusive term which has come to mean not induced by 'improper' inducements, such as bribing or physical violence, but not including the inducements normally associated with charge and <b>sentence</b> <b>bargaining</b> (except for inducements involving 'overcharging' by prosecutors)." [...] "Intelligent" [...] has been described as [...] "also an elusive term, meaning that the defendant knows his rights, the nature of the charge to which he is pleading, and the consequences of his plea." ...|$|R

40|$|A {{plea bargain}} allows an individual, {{accused of a}} crime, an {{opportunity}} to reduce their <b>sentence</b> by <b>bargaining</b> with the prosecution. Although such agreements often stipulate that the accused waive certain constitutional rights, the conditions attached to a bargained-for-probation sentence are not beyond judicial review. Normally, courts examine {{the constitutionality of the}} probationary condition, but in United States v. Barnett, the Seventh Circuit summarily upheld the suspicionless search of a probationer upon the consent/contract theory. This Comment contends that the consent/contract theory employed by the Seventh Circuit improperly hooks the crook by upholding unreasonable probationary conditions that violate the constitution on the questionable basis that a convict voluntarily consents to conditions that they cannot avoid...|$|R

40|$|This {{symposium}} essay {{explores the}} impact of Rita, Gall, and Kimbrough on state and federal <b>sentencing</b> and plea <b>bargaining</b> systems. The Court continues {{to try to explain}} how the Sixth Amendment jury trial right limits legislative and judicial control of criminal sentencing. Equally important, the opposing sides in this debate have begun to form a stable consensus. These decisions inject more uncertainty in the process and free trial judges to counterbalance prosecutors. Thus, we predict, these decisions will move the balance of plea bargaining power back toward criminal defendants...|$|R
40|$|CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. INITIATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT AND STATUTE. Amends {{constitution}} to enact changes in criminal trial proceedings. Provides judges rather than attorneys shall question prospective jurors; questions limited to determining whether jurors can be challenged for cause. Requires that questioning be in {{presence of other}} jurors. Excepting death penalty cases, provides that verdict may be rendered by 10 of 12 jurors rather than by unanimous vote. Provides grand jury indictment is sufficient to compel a trial without a preliminary hearing. Requires Superior Court judges prepare and post specified reports, including <b>sentences,</b> plea <b>bargains,</b> and <b>sentence</b> recommendations. Makes other changes. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: Some changes, especially those relating to the jury selection process and nonunanimous jury verdicts, probably would result in savings {{to state and local}} governments. Provisions imposing additional judicial recordkeeping requirements would result in additional costs to counties. Given data presently available, measure would probably result in unknown net savings to the state and local governments...|$|R

50|$|One {{controversial}} {{legal issue}} in this film is possible witness coaching, a violation of legal canons. The only plausible legal defense Lt. Manion has—the insanity defense—is virtually spelled out to a befuddled Manion by his prospective counsel, who then temporarily suspends the conversation and suggests that Manion rethink his factual/legal position. Witness coaching by the prosecution is even more blatant as they call in other jail inmates awaiting sentencing to testify against Manion, and is portrayed as subornation of perjury to an extent. The first suggests that the defendant may be concealing the truth and manipulating his story {{in order to obtain}} the best possible verdict, and the latter that the prosecution dangled a possible lighter <b>sentence</b> through plea <b>bargain</b> as an incentive to perjury.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the potential role that plea bargaining may serve {{in an environment}} where trials and incarceration are costless, there is no chance of convicting innocent defendants, and coercion is not necessary to obtain further information from arrested defendants. This analysis shows that even in the frictionless judicial system environment outlined above, a risk-averse society may still 8 ̆ 5 nd it optimal to resolve a large fraction, or even all of its cases through plea bargaining. However, this is not always the case. If defendants are generally risk-loving, mutually acceptable plea bargains may not be possible, but when they are, the plea <b>bargain</b> <b>sentences</b> will necessarily fall short of even the expected sentence from going to trial, regardless of the relative bargaining power between prosecutors and defendants...|$|R
40|$|This {{anthology}} collects the ten {{winners of}} the 2014 Best American Newspaper Narrative Writing Contest, run by the Mayborn Literary Nonfiction Conference. The event is hosted by the Frank W. Mayborn Graduate Institute of Journalism at the University of North Texas. The contest honors exemplary narrative work and encourages narrative nonfiction storytelling at newspapers across the United States. First place winner: Dan Barry, “The Boys in the Bunkhouse,” published by The New York Times, exposed thirty years of physical and mental abuse of intellectually disabled men living in an Iowa group home. Second place: Christopher Goffard, “The Favor,” published by the Los Angeles Times, describes the plea <b>bargain</b> <b>sentence</b> of {{the son of a}} former California assembly speaker, after the son pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter, and whose prison sentence was later reduced by then-California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Runners-up include Nathan Bomey, John Gallagher and Mark Stryker, “How Detroit was Reborn” (Detroit Free Press); Monica Hesse, “Love and Fire” (Washington Post); Sarah Schweitzer, “Chasing Bayla” (Boston Globe); Sarah Kleiner Varble, “Then the Walls Closed In” (The Virginian Pilot); Joanne Kimberlin and Janie Bryant, “Dangerous Minds” (The Virginian Pilot); Molly Harbarger, “Fred Nelligan” (The Oregonian); and Mark Johnson, “Murray's Problem” (Milwaukee Journal Sentinel) ...|$|R
40|$|Econometric {{measures}} {{of the effect of}} capital punishment have increasingly provided evidence that it deters homicides. However, most researchers {{on both sides of the}} death penalty debate continue to rely on rather simple assumptions about criminal behavior. I attempt to provide a more nuanced and predictive rational choice model of the incentives and disincentives to kill, with the aim of assessing to what extent the statistical findings of deterrence are in line with theoretical expectations. In particular, I examine whether it is plausible to suppose there is a marginal increase in deterrence created by increasing the penalty from life imprisonment without parole to capital punishment. The marginal deterrence effect is shown to be a direct negative function of prison conditions as they are anticipated by the potential offender – the more tolerable someone perceives imprisonment to be, the less deterrent effect prison will have, and the greater the amount of marginal deterrence the threat of capital punishment will add. I then examine the empirical basis for believing there to be a subset of killers who are relatively unafraid of the prison environment, and who therefore may be deterred effectively only by the death penalty. Criminals, empirically, appear to fear a capital sentence, and are willing to sacrifice important procedural rights during plea bargaining to avoid this risk. This has the additional effect of increasing the mean expected term of years attached to a murder conviction, and may generate a secondary deterrent effect of capital punishment. At least for some offenders, the death penalty should induce greater caution in their use of lethal violence, and the deterrent effect seen statistically is possibly derived from the change in the behavior of these individuals. This identification of a particular group on whom the death penalty has the greatest marginal effect naturally suggests reforms in <b>sentencing</b> (and plea <b>bargaining)</b> which focus expensive capital prosecutions on those most resistant to alternative criminal sanctions...|$|R
