The video begins by showing Wade sitting alone on a bed, with {{pictures}} of him and his girlfriend on the wall. He proceeds to walk around the house, while various things in the room he's in begin to explode around him, such as the bed and pictures in the bedroom, and various food and drink items in the kitchen. Near the end things begin going in reverse, and everything that had exploded is put back together. The video ends with Wade <b>sitting</b> <b>back</b> on the bed with his girlfriend now lying next to him.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, the Coast Guard cutter Chase took over, escorting the KD II to San Diego. Along {{the way the}} {{investigation}} continued. The Coast Guard reported that the four-man crew was cooperative with {{the investigation}}, largely <b>sitting</b> <b>back</b> and watching television in the lounge. Since they claimed not to have finned the sharks themselves, they believed they had not done anything wrong. Ship's records revealed that the KD II had met fishing vessels, primarily Korean longline fishing boats, at prearranged locations {{on the high seas}} near the Fiji and Solomon Islands and bought fins from them for a total of $250,000. On an earlier voyage that summer, the ship had made $6 million from shark fins obtained the same way. Korean-language records from a broker on board indicated an ongoing operation, giving the names of other ships involved. The refrigeration unit on board had broken before the ship had left Honolulu, and the fins were out on deck in an attempt to dry them out and reduce the odor.|$|E

500|$|... "Sexy! No No No..." [...] is an electropunk song, which {{consists}} of three songs welded together, according to journalist Peter Robinson: one with a samba rhythm, one with a sped-up sample and a breakbeat, and an intro from elsewhere. The track opens with Cole singing over a [...] "spooky" [...] instrumentation. Her vocals have been vocodered and she sings [...] "Cause I've been <b>sitting</b> <b>back,</b> no chance of falling / Hoping that nothing ever blows, no no / Boy, {{did you ever think}} that loving would be / Nothing more than walking me home, no no". As the chorus begins, the song incorporates a sample from Scottish rock band Nazareth's 1975 track [...] "Hair of the Dog", and the group starts singing, [...] "Did you tell him? No no no / Give him kisses? No no no / Whisper honey? No no no / You're delicious? Hell no". John Murphy of musicOMH noted that [...] "Sexy! No No No.." [...] is not [...] "structured like a proper pop song - there's no verse-chorus-verse". The instrumentation of [...] "Sexy! No No No..." [...] is composed of multi-layered guitar riffs and [...] "euphoric woo woo-oo harmonies", while the song's structure follows as introduction, chorus, chorus, verse, bridge, chorus, middle eight, verse. A Newsround reviewer described the lyrical content, saying that Girls Aloud are [...] "trying a different approach to getting the guy", in that [...] "instead of being 'sexy', they've backed off." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the chancel {{the scenes}} of Adam and Eve cover the west wall above the chancel arch. They include an unusual trompe-l'œil {{representation}} of the Temptation, {{made to look like}} a textile wall hanging. Other scenes show the pair hiding their nakedness, <b>sitting</b> <b>back</b> to back, and lamenting after the fall. Eve is depicted being tempted by the forbidden fruit by a wyvern-like serpent, and milking a cow. This last scene is a unique depiction of Eve. [...] The figures are [...] "violent and elongated [...] as distorted as a Russian ikon, and Ian Nairn noted the [...] "diagrammatic sketching in of belly and buttocks is brilliant".|$|E
2500|$|Ford hired Harry {{to work in}} one of his auto plants. Several months later, Ford gave Harry a job as a {{test pilot}} for the Stout Metal Airplane Division of the Ford Motor Company. Although still very young, Brooks soon became Ford’s top pilot, as well as a close friend whom Ford nicknamed [...] "Brooksie". Brooks {{demonstrated}} the capabilities of the new monoplane Ford Trimotor to biplane maker, William Boeing by handing him the controls and <b>sitting</b> <b>back</b> in the passenger cabin. For the first night flight of a Ford Trimotor, Brooks flew Charles Lindbergh's mother from Detroit to Cleveland. Brooks was also the pilot that flew Lindbergh's mother to Mexico, alongside the Spirit of St. Louis in their 1927 publicity trips. On February 10, 1927, Brooks flew the first aircraft guided solely by a radio-beacon system.|$|E
2500|$|The seventh {{track on}} Odd Blood, [...] "Rome", {{features}} beats taken from Moroccan and Syrian dance music that Keating's wife {{had on her}} iPod, while for [...] "Strange Reunions", Yeasayer created a short song under three minutes by exploring unconventional time signatures in different parts {{in the style of}} fellow New York City band Dirty Projectors. [...] "Mondegreen" [...] follows and is an old song created by Keating using samplers plugged into a television set. Using four channels which showed programs like infomercials and soap operas, he recorded four banks of sound and structured a song by singing on top of the material. The last track, [...] "Grizelda", is, according to Tuton, [...] "a nice way to close an album. It lulls you into <b>sitting</b> <b>back</b> in your chair, puts you in a trance a bit, although the subject matter might be a bit dark." ...|$|E

2500|$|Trump {{called the}} book [...] "terribly written" [...] and said, [...] "Rather than <b>sitting</b> <b>back</b> and letting false {{statements}} be published without challenge, I {{believe it is}} important to expose irresponsible, malicious and false reporting. The writer and publisher of this book knew full well that their statements were false and malicious, but in hopes of generating book sales, they did not care. In so doing, they exposed themselves to this lawsuit." [...] Trump's attorneys stated: [...] "The obvious purpose of that malicious scheme and those vile statements is to embarrass Trump, to damage him in his business and professional dealings and to create publicity in order to increase sales of O'Brien's newly released book." [...] Trump's attorneys also alleged that O'Brien spent a three-hour visit at Trump's office attempting to pressure one of Trump's lawyers into going on a date with him, rather than researching Trump's finances.|$|E
2500|$|Perry {{described}} the process [...] "a very pure moment for me" [...] and continued saying, [...] " [...] where I started my creative juices. And also {{it kind of}} exudes this euphoric feeling because everybody remembers what their teenage dreams were — all the girls that were on your poster walls." [...] After she recorded the vocals, McKee pulled Luke and Martin aside and told them her idea, to which they responded, [...] "Well why didn't you {{say that in the}} first place?". The chorus was rewritten, and the line [...] "Skin tight jeans" [...] was taken from the early [...] "trying me on" [...] version. When the final version was finished, McKee said, [...] "We were all so pumped that it had paid off. I remember Max <b>sitting</b> <b>back</b> and saying 'I wish we could bottle this feeling'. It was really magical." [...] Perry commented that even though the song was rewritten many times, she was [...] "so happy to finally get somewhere that we all agreed on" [...] after it was finished. During an interview in June 2010, Perry confirmed [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] as the second single from the album, and said that the song was about [...] "kind of like feeling that way when you were a teenager: really emotional, really invested..... It's intense being in love and being a teenager." [...] After confirming that [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] was also the title of the album, she explained that it was a throwback to her teenage years, as she thought back to her youth while contemplating marriage to her boyfriend Russell Brand. She added, [...] "To me, this year is pretty heavy. I am going to be getting married and putting out this record, and there is so much going on that it's nice to think of those young dreams." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to damages {{for not getting}} the thing promised itself, a contract breaker must compensate for the costly consequences of the breach that one would reasonably expect to exist. There must be a causal connection between the breach and the consequence complained of. In Saamco v York Montague Ltd it was held a bank could not recover damages from property valuer {{for all of the}} difference in what the properties it bought after getting the valuations were assured to be and actual property values, because {{a large part of the}} difference resulted from generally depressed market prices following [...] "Black Wednesday" [...] in 1992. In a business deal, calculation will typically be based on the forgone profits that one could reasonably have expected to make. This could also include the [...] "loss of a chance" [...] to profit, so in Chaplin v Hicks an entrant in a beauty contest wrongfully excluded from the final round was awarded 25% of the final prize money to reflect her 1 in 4 chance of having won. One limit lies at consequential losses that are too [...] "remote", or are not a natural result of the breach, and are not in the parties' contemplation. In Hadley v Baxendale a miller tried to recover damages from Baxendale's delivery company for the lost profits from his mill grinding to a halt, after they were late delivering a crankshaft back from being fixed. But Alderson B held that because millers would usually be expected to keep spare crank shafts, and because he had not informed Baxendale of the importance of the timely delivery, an award for profits could not be compensated. More recently in The Achilleas the majority of the House of Lords preferred to express the remoteness rule as one of construing the contract to reflect the parties' [...] "background of market expectations". Transfield Shipping returned The Achilleas late to its owner, Mercator, which led Mercator to lose a lucrative contract with Cargill that would make over $1.3million, an occurrence that was plainly a natural consequence of the breach and easily foreseeable. Yet because the standard practice and expectation in the shipping industry was that if a ship were returned late only the ordinary sum for hire would be due, this was the limit on recovery. It is also possible to lose one's entitlement to damages if steps are not taken to mitigate further losses, that any prudent person would, rather than <b>sitting</b> <b>back</b> and letting losses run up. But the burden of proof of a failure to mitigate is on a contract breaker, to whom the courts are unlikely to be sympathetic. A contract breaker could may also, if a concurrent liability arises in tort, argue a claimant's damages should be reduced to reflect their contributory fault, and the courts can reduce an award to achieve a just and equitable result. Sometimes potential profits will be too uncertain, or a general fall in market prices means that even claiming damages for the thing itself would leave one in a negative position, and so the courts allow a claimant to choose whether to sue, not for a failure in expectations, but to cover her expenses in preparing for the contract, or the [...] "reliance interest". In Anglia Television Ltd v Reed a TV channel successfully sued Robert Reed for not turning up for shooting a film. It was unclear whether the film would make any profits at all, and so Anglia TV got compensated for its wasted expenses in preparing the set. The level of damages is generally assessed at the date of the breach, but this is variable if the court thinks another time would be fairer.|$|E
