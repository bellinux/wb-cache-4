5|$|The {{group was}} renamed Gipsy in 1969, which they {{considered}} more macho and Western-sounding. The <b>schedule</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> band, {{which had no}} manager, became increasingly busy, since they had begun giving regular performances at Ismail Marzuki Park. As a result, Chrisye decided {{to drop out of}} UKI; in 1970 he transferred to Trisakti Tourism Academy, where he considered the study schedule to be more flexible.|$|E
5|$|The <b>schedule</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> mission {{called for}} the astronauts to follow the landing with a five-hour sleep period {{as they had been}} awake since early morning.

5|$|By {{the time}} the tenders were submitted, it turned out only NSB, DSB and Veolia had chosen bid. The tender was won by NSB Anbud on 30 May 2005, wanting NOK 70 million {{annually}} for the contract, ten million less than with the former agreement. After the contract was won, NSB Anbud announced the <b>schedule</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Gjøvik Line. The number of train services would increase by 40%. Three stations serving the recreational area Nordmarka outside Oslo would be dropped—Elnes, Stryken and Bjørgeseter. Skogsholm tried to make an agreement with NSB to not abandon all the stations, but since this had not {{been part of the}} PSO tender, an agreement could not be made and the service was canceled.|$|E

5|$|Coleman {{hired the}} Portland company Sandstrom Design {{to help with}} marketing. Sandstrom helped to improve the promotional {{materials}} of the organization, while Portland Center Stage modified the nature and style of its performances. Sandstrom Design produced a 56-page flyer that showed the performance <b>schedule</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 2003–2004 season which was mailed to subscribers, potential customers, handed out at performances and placed around town. The promotional campaign stressed the unique qualities of a live theater performance as entertainment over television and film. PCS's productions were presented in the Winningstad and Newmark theatres in Portland through the 2005–2006 season. Portland Center Stage moved to the new Gerding Theater at the Armory beginning with the 2006–2007 season.|$|E
5|$|Jim Carrey was {{considered}} for the part of Jack Sparrow. However, the production <b>schedule</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> Curse of the Black Pearl conflicted with Bruce Almighty. Others {{considered for the}} role include Michael Keaton and Christopher Walken. Although Cook had been a strong proponent of adapting Disney's rides into films, the box office failure of The Country Bears (2002) made Michael Eisner attempt to shut down production of Pirates of the Caribbean. However, Verbinski told his concept artists to keep working on the picture, and when Eisner came to visit, the executive was astonished by what had been created.|$|E
5|$|Knights of the Old Republic II was {{developed}} by Obsidian Entertainment and published by LucasArts. It is the sequel to BioWare's Knights of the Old Republic, and it uses the same Odyssey Engine as the original game. BioWare suggested that Obsidian should be offered the Knights of the Old Republic license due to their familiarity with Obsidian's past work and the good {{relationship between the two}} developers, as well as due to finding LucasArts' development <b>schedule</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sequel to be too tight. The game was released in PC and Xbox versions, but due to the Xbox version being released two months prior to the PC version, it has multiple unfixed bugs.|$|E

5|$|MTV {{reported}} in February 2008 that Summit Entertainment intended {{to create a}} series {{of at least three}} films based on Meyer's books. The studio had optioned New Moon, the second book in the series, by October 2008, and confirmed their plans to make a film based on it November 22, 2008. Because Catherine Hardwicke had wanted more preparation time than Summit's <b>schedule</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> production and release of the sequel would provide, Chris Weitz was selected to direct it in December 2008.|$|E
5|$|Hershey faced a {{challenging}} <b>schedule</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{end of its}} regular season, with {{only three of the}} last 14 games scheduled for home. This marked the fewest in team history, with a previous low of five games in the final 14 of 2002–03. The team also experienced significant roster changes in March, with Orlov, Oleksy and Schilling all being recalled to the Washington Capitals. Almeida and Kostenko were reassigned to the Reading Royals, Nicolas Deschamps joined the Bears roster, and Kevin Marshall was for defenseman Chay Genoway. Capitals winger Joey Crabb also cleared waivers and was assigned to Hershey on March 23. The Bears ended a two-game losing streak with a 4–1 victory over Worcester on March 24, but lost 5–3 on March 29 to Albany, who had just lost six consecutive games. Grubauer was replaced by Sabourin after surrendering three shots on seven goals. Hershey defeated Providence 3–2 the next day, rallying with two goals in the final 12 minutes. It marked the first time this season the Bears had won a game after trailing for two periods.|$|E
5|$|Sound Transit began {{exploring}} {{means to}} accelerate {{the construction of the}} South 200th Street station in 2010, using federal grants to align the opening with the University Link Extension in 2016 and provide additional parking capacity to supplement Tukwila International Boulevard station. In December 2010, amid a tax revenue shortfall during the ongoing economic recession, the Sound Transit Board elected to suspend all design work on the light rail project south of South 200th Street. The Sound Transit Board officially approved an accelerated <b>schedule</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> South 200th Street station in July 2011, seeking a federal Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant of up to $34 million; a $10 million grant was awarded in December, allowing the opening date for the station to move from 2020 to September 2016.|$|E
