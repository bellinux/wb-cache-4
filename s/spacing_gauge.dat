The kinematical problem is solved using a generalized eigenvector formalism based on the Segré classification of symmetric rank 2 tensors {{with respect to a}} Lorentzian metric. Securing the correct relationship between the two null cones dynamically plausibly is achieved using the naive gauge freedom.
