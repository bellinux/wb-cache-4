5|$|A Megalosaurus rib {{figured in}} 1856 and 1884 by Sir Richard Owen has a {{pathological}} <b>swollen</b> spot {{near the base}} of its capitular process. The <b>swollen</b> spot {{appears to have been}} caused by a healed fracture and is located at the point where it would have articulated with its vertebra.|$|E
5|$|Although Wipha did not {{directly}} impact the Philippines, the outer bands of the storm produced severe flooding in Negros Occidental. The flooding washed out large areas of agricultural land worth PHP10.3million ($211,000USD). Numerous farm to market roads were also damaged or destroyed, costing PHP5million ($103,000USD). The floods also destroyed 13 homes and damaged 31 others. A rare tornado spawned by the storm destroyed four homes and damaged 19 others. A total of 7,640 families were affected by Wipha in the Philippines. The heavy rains caused a landslide which killed one person on September16. Another man drowned in a flood <b>swollen</b> river on September21. Three other people were listed as missing after being swept away in a river <b>swollen</b> by Wipha.|$|E
5|$|Areas from {{northern}} Nicaragua to South-Central Mexico experienced heavy rains from the storm, with notable flooding occurring in many areas. <b>Swollen</b> rivers displaced thousands in Veracruz and killed two people, while two others {{were killed by}} a river in Oaxaca. In El Salvador, one person was killed by flooding.|$|E
5|$|Factors {{indicating}} infection include {{movement of}} fluid in the tissues during palpation (fluctuance), <b>swollen</b> lymph nodes in the neck, and fever with an oral temperature more than 37.7°C.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} {{was reported}} {{throughout the state}} of Sinaloa. A total of 26 neighborhoods were flooded with up to 4.9ft (1.5m) {{of water in the}} town of Culiacán, while a 14-year-old boy was swept away by a <b>swollen</b> river.|$|E
5|$|In June 1911, Charlotte {{attended}} {{her cousin}} George V's coronation in England, but the country's summer heat left her bed-ridden with a <b>swollen</b> face and {{pain in her}} limbs. On 25 June 1914, her husband inherited his father's dukedom and became Bernhard III, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. World War I broke out on 28 July; Bernhard left for the front while Charlotte remained behind to oversee the duchy, serving mainly as a figurehead. During the war, Charlotte increasingly experienced various pains including chronic aches, <b>swollen</b> legs, and kidney problems. The degree of the pain became so severe that she took opium as her only comfortable treatment.|$|E
5|$|A {{subgroup}} of solar urticaria, fixed solar urticaria, {{has also been}} identified. It is a rare, less intense form of the disease with wheals (<b>swollen</b> areas of the skin) that affect certain, fixed areas of the body. Fixed solar urticaria is induced by {{a broad spectrum of}} radiative energy with wavelengths ranging from 300–700nm.|$|E
5|$|Adult {{specimens}} have {{a moderately}} flared, posteriorly protruding outer lip, which is considerably thickened and completely devoid of marginal spikes or plicae. The body whorl is roundly <b>swollen</b> at the shoulder, {{with a few}} anterior spiral grooves. The shell has a medium-to-high cone-shaped spire, with at least five delicately furrowed whorls.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{infestation}} by this aphid, leaves of sugar beet become <b>swollen,</b> roll, and cease developing. The roots grow poorly and the sugar content is reduced. In some other plants the leaves do not become distorted but growth is affected and flowers abort due to {{the action of the}} toxic saliva injected by the aphid to improve the flow of sap.|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy {{for breast}} or skin cancer may cause scar tissue to form around the {{treatment}} area. In {{the case of}} breast brachytherapy, fat necrosis may occur {{as a result of}} fatty acids entering the breast tissues. This can cause the breast tissue to become <b>swollen</b> and tender. Fat necrosis is a benign condition and typically occurs 4–12 months after treatment and affects about 2% of patients.|$|E
5|$|Disorders of {{the thyroid}} are functional–caused by {{dysfunction}} {{in the production}} of hormones, and nodes and tumors either benign or malignant. Functional disorders can cause inflammation as can some other forms of thyroiditis. Functional disorders can result in the overproduction or underproduction of hormones. Any of the functional thyroid disorders can result in the gland's enlargement and cause a <b>swollen</b> neck termed a goitre.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, {{the floods}} {{were the worst}} in Haiti in decades. There, a <b>swollen</b> river {{destroyed}} several homes in Les Cayes, and there were 21deaths nationwide. In neighboring Dominican Republic, flooding isolated several towns and caused mudslides that killed 12people. In Cuba, flooding was worst in the easternmost four provinces, and there were five deaths. The overall system spawned a subtropical cyclone on June5 that later became Tropical Storm Andrew.|$|E
5|$|From the lake, Cortés {{continued}} {{south along}} the western slopes of the Maya Mountains, a particularly arduous journey that took 12 days to cover , during which he lost {{more than two-thirds of}} his horses. When he came to a river <b>swollen</b> with the constant torrential rains that had been falling during the expedition, Cortés turned upstream to the Gracias a Dios rapids, which took two days to cross and cost him more horses.|$|E
5|$|Gout {{is a form}} of {{inflammatory}} arthritis characterized by recurrent attacks of a red, tender, hot, and <b>swollen</b> joint. Pain typically comes on rapidly in less than twelve hours. The joint {{at the base of the}} big toe is affected in about half of cases. It may also result in tophi, kidney stones, or urate nephropathy.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, George Bentham {{published}} the first infrageneric arrangement of Adenanthos in Volume 5 of his landmark Flora Australiensis. Bentham divided the genus into two sections, placing A.obovata in A.sect. Eurylaema, defined as containing those species with one sterile stamen, and perianth tubes that are curved and <b>swollen</b> above the middle.|$|E
5|$|In {{advance of}} the system, {{officials}} issued storm warnings for coastal areas of Alabama and western Florida, and residents in low-lying areas were advised to seek higher ground. Damage associated with the cyclone was generally minor, and only one life was lost when a boy fell into the <b>swollen</b> waters of a river and drowned.|$|E
5|$|Landslides were {{reported}} in eastern Jamaica, triggered by heavy rain as the storm passed south of the island. Five people were killed due to an accident caused by flash flooding. Damages in Jamaica were estimated at $65million. Damage was also reported in Trinidad and Tobago, where landslides and flooding damaged several homes. In Honduras, a man drowned in a river <b>swollen</b> by rains from Emily.|$|E
5|$|Mycena adscendens {{produces}} a white spore print. The spores are broadly , amyloid, and have dimensions of 8–10 by 5–6.5µm. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are two-spored, club-shaped, and measure 14–17 by 7–9µm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill faces) {{may be present}} or absent. If present, they {{are similar to the}} cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edges). The cheilocystidia are abundant, measuring 28–44 by 8–12µm. They are variable in shape, often fusoid-ventricose (fuse-shaped with a <b>swollen</b> center) or with 2–3 needle-like projections arising from the apex; the projections are sometimes forked. The <b>swollen</b> parts of the cheilocystidia are covered with short rodlike protuberances or warts. The flesh of the gills is vinaceous-brown when stained in iodine. The flesh of the cap is made up of greatly enlarged cells, with the surface covered with club-shaped to almost globular cells measuring 25–40 by about 20µm. Their walls are finely verrucose (covered with small warts), and all but the verrucose cells are -brown in iodine. Clamp connections are abundant in the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|PVSJ 407, a Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis, had a pit in a skull bone {{attributed}} by Paul Sereno and Novas to a bite. Two additional pits {{occurred on}} the splenial. The areas around these pits are <b>swollen</b> and porous, suggesting the wounds were afflicted by a short-lived non-lethal infection. Because of the size and angles of the wound, {{it is likely that}} they were obtained in a fight with another Herrerasaurus.|$|E
5|$|Phlegmasia cerulea dolens is a {{very large}} and {{dangerous}} type of DVT. It is characterized by an acute and almost total venous occlusion of the entire extremity outflow, including the iliac and femoral veins. The leg is usually painful, tinged blue in color, and <b>swollen,</b> which may result in venous gangrene.|$|E
5|$|Reversion is {{a serious}} disease {{transmitted}} by the blackcurrant gall mite Cecidophyopsis ribis. It causes a decline in yield and is quite widespread in Europe but is rarely encountered on other continents. Symptoms include a modification of leaf shape in summer and <b>swollen</b> buds ("big bud") in winter, each housing thousands of microscopic mites. As pest control has limited effectiveness, severely infected bushes should be destroyed. All new plants purchased should be certified as virus-free.|$|E
5|$|The {{acute phase}} lasts {{for the first}} few weeks or months of infection. It usually occurs unnoticed because it is symptom-free or {{exhibits}} only mild symptoms that are not unique to Chagas disease. These can include fever, fatigue, body aches, muscle pain, headache, rash, loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. The signs on physical examination can include mild enlargement of the liver or spleen, <b>swollen</b> glands, and local swelling (a chagoma) where the parasite entered the body.|$|E
5|$|The bat has a {{distinctive}} <b>swollen,</b> pig-like snout with thin, vertical nostrils. Its ears are relatively large, while its eyes {{are small and}} mostly concealed by fur. Its teeth are typical of an insectivorous bat. The dental formula is 1:1:1:3 in the upper jaw and 2:1:2:3 in the lower jaw, with large upper incisors.|$|E
5|$|The {{brightest}} star in this constellation is Alpha Lyncis, with an apparent (visual) magnitude of 3.14. It is an orange giant of spectral type K7III located 203 ± 2 light-years distant from Earth. Around twice as massive as the Sun, it has exhausted the hydrogen {{at its core}} and has evolved away from the main sequence. The star has <b>swollen</b> to about 55 times the Sun's radius and is emitting roughly 673 times the luminosity of the Sun. The stellar atmosphere has cooled, giving it a surface temperature of 3,880K., see Table 1. The only star with a proper name is Alsciaukat (from the Arabic for thorn), also known as 31 Lyncis, located 380 ± 10 light-years from Earth. This star is also an evolved giant with around twice the Sun's mass that has <b>swollen</b> and cooled since exhausting its core hydrogen. It is anywhere from 59 to 75 times {{as wide as the}} Sun, and 740 times as luminous. Alsciaukat is also a variable star, ranging in brightness by 0.05 magnitude over 25 to 30 days from its baseline magnitude of 4.25.|$|E
5|$|The light {{infantry}} of 1,200 velites {{consisted of}} unarmoured skirmishing troops {{drawn from the}} youngest and lower social classes. They were armed with a sword and buckler (90cm (3ft) diameter), {{as well as several}} light javelins, each with a 90cm (3ft) wooden shaft the diameter of a finger, with a c.25cm (10in) narrow metal point. Their numbers were <b>swollen</b> by the addition of allied light infantry and irregular rorarii.|$|E
5|$|The onion eelworm (Ditylenchus dipsaci), a tiny {{parasitic}} soil-living nematode, causes <b>swollen,</b> distorted foliage. Young {{plants are}} killed and older ones produce soft bulbs. No cure is known and affected plants should be uprooted and burned. The site {{should not be}} used for growing onions again for several years and should also be avoided for growing carrots, parsnips, and beans, which are also susceptible to the eelworm.|$|E
5|$|The skull is {{somewhat}} {{smaller than that}} of N.matroka and the braincase and palate are narrower. Compared to N.somalica, the skull is broader. The ridge on the lacrimal bone is better developed, the palate is broader, the frontal bones contain a depression and are <b>swollen</b> at the sides, the mastoid bones are smaller, and the coronoid and angular processes of the mandible (lower jaw) are more prominent.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is dark purplish-brown. Spores range in shape from roughly rhomboid to roughly elliptical, and {{typically}} have dimensions of 5–6 by 4–6μm. They are thick-walled {{and have a}} large germ pore. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped to <b>swollen,</b> hyaline, usually four-spored (although rarely two- or three-spored forms are present), and measure 13–19 by 4.4–6.6μm. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are ventricose (<b>swollen)</b> near the base and often mucronate (ending abruptly in a short sharp point) at the apex, and measure 14–25 by 4.4–10.5μm. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are variable in shape, and measure 14–40 by 4.4–7.7μm. Pleurocystidia are relatively sparse, while cheilocystidia are abundant. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} hyphae. The application of a drop of potassium hydroxide solution turns both the cap and the stem from brown to blackish.|$|E
5|$|The spores are {{translucent}} (hyaline), smooth, have {{an ellipsoid}} shape, with dimensions of 12–16 by 3–5µm. Spores contain {{one or two}} oil droplets. The imperfect (conidial) form of the fungus produces smooth, hyaline spores that are 3–3.5 by 1–2µm. The asci – sexual spore-bearing cells – have a cylindrical shape, with dimensions of 115–125 by 8–10µm. The paraphyses (sterile filamentous cells interspersed among the asci) are cylindrical with slightly <b>swollen</b> tips, and few branches.|$|E
5|$|Upon arrival, the {{children}} were exhausted and virtually naked. Their appearance was skeletal, especially those transported from Stara Gradiška. Many had <b>swollen</b> bellies due to malnourishment, thin pale faces, and teeth falling out. Almost all were suffering from severe diarrhea, and most had multiple diseases. Some children died after the effort of simply getting up.|$|E
5|$|Albeit disorganized, Emily and its {{remnants}} dropped extensive precipitation {{across the}} Dominican Republic, with maximum totals {{of up to}} 21inches (528mm) recorded in Neiba. Among other consequences, severe flooding and isolated mudslides left 56 communities isolated from surrounding areas. The storm displaced up to 7,534 people throughout the country, of which 1,549 sought refuge in storm shelters. Consecutive hours of rainfall resulted in the overflow of some rivers, although no significant damage was reported to adjacent areas. Offshore, squalls generated rough waves that briefly affected boating operations and oceanside homes. To the east of Santo Domingo, two men drowned after getting caught in a <b>swollen</b> river. A third drowning fatality occurred elsewhere in the capital due to flooding.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it appears}} to be a single star to the naked eye, Capella is {{actually}} a system of four stars in two binary pairs. The first pair consists of two bright yellow giant stars, both of which are around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun. They have exhausted their core hydrogen, and cooled and <b>swollen,</b> moving off the main sequence. Designated Capella Aa and Capella Ab, they are in a very tight circular orbit some 0.76 astronomical units (au) apart, and orbit each other every 104 days. Capella Aa is the cooler and more luminous of the two with spectral class K0III; it is 78.7 ± 4.2 times the Sun's luminosity and 11.98 ± 0.57 times its radius.|$|E
5|$|By 1859, Rosalie Cadron-Jetté's {{health was}} {{worsening}} significantly. Information about the particular conditions she was afflicted with is contradictory. Testimony from Cadron-Jetté's family suggests that Cadron-Jetté had become ill {{when she was}} 36 years old and never fully recovered. Other sources suggest generalised edema, known {{at the time as}} dropsy, while still others diagnose her with chronic nephritis, known at the time as Bright's disease, which worsened over the following years. Symptoms observed in Cadron-Jetté by her contemporaries included difficulty breathing, almost constant coughing, fits of breathlessness while standing and at rest, and <b>swollen</b> legs displaying open sores.|$|E
5|$|By mid-February the {{symptoms}} of those involved were deteriorating; their symptoms included burn wounds, <b>swollen</b> hands, diarrhoea, fever, and hair loss. One of the scrap collectors went to Samut Prakan Hospital on 15 February and was admitted the next day, while the two scrapyard employees were also admitted, on 16 and 17 February. The scrapyard owner's husband was admitted to Bangkok General Hospital on 17 February due to epistaxis (nosebleeds), while the scrapyard owner, her mother, and her maid (all of whom {{lived across the street}} from the scrapyard and sometimes entered) also began to feel ill. A stray dog that was often seen in the scrapyard also died.|$|E
5|$|Communications with severed with towns {{along the}} southwestern {{coastline}} as roads and rail lines were washed away. Thousands of residents sought refuge by moving to higher ground. The Korean relief center reported that 762homes were destroyed and another 11,700flooded {{due to the}} storm. Other reports indicated that upwards of 5,900homes were destroyed. More than 191,000acres (77,300hectares) of farmland was washed out. Throughout South Korea, 113people lost their lives. Most of the deaths resulted from landslides, <b>swollen</b> rivers, and collapsed embankments. Total damage in the country amounted to $134million, with agriculture accounting for at least $24million. Additionally, 28,000people were left homeless. The disaster relief agency Hope Bridge provided 7.5billion won ($10.2million) in aid to areas affected by the storm.|$|E
5|$|Depicting the {{eyepiece}} of the microscope is Gamma Microscopii, which—at magnitude of4.68—is {{the brightest star}} in the constellation. Having spent much of its 620-million-year lifespan as a blue-white main sequence star, it has <b>swollen</b> and cooled to become a yellow giant of spectral type G6III, with a diameter ten times that of the Sun. Measurement of its parallax yields a distance of 229±4 light years from Earth. At around 2.5 times the mass of the Sun, it likely passed within 1.14 and 3.45 light-years of the Sun some 3.9 million years ago, possibly massive enough and close enough to disturb the Oort cloud. Alpha Microscopii is also an ageing yellow giant star of spectral type G7III with an apparent magnitude of 4.90. Located 380±30 light-years away from Earth, it has <b>swollen</b> to 17.5times the diameter of the Sun. Alpha has a 10th magnitude companion, visible in 7.5cm telescopes, though this is a coincidental closeness rather than a true binary system. Epsilon Microscopii lies 182±2 light years away, and is a white star of apparent magnitude 4.7, and spectral type A1V. Theta1 and Theta2 Microscopii make up a wide double whose components are splittable to the naked eye. Both are white A-class magnetic spectrum variable stars with strong metallic lines, similar to Cor Caroli. They mark the constellation's specimen slide.|$|E
