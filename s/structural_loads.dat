5|$|It is an {{outstanding}} example of a late medieval aisled barn and is the largest timber-framed building in England. Barns of this type {{were based on a}} longitudinal frame, with two rows of posts connected by arcade plates. Because such barns tend to be both long and high, they experience high <b>structural</b> <b>loads</b> from the wind. They therefore have numerous internal braces, acting {{in much the same way}} as buttresses, to strengthen the structure. This gives the barn its distinctive internal appearance, with a lattice of beams and braces holding up the roof. The techniques used in its construction are similar to those employed on the great cathedrals being built at the time, and some of the same craftsmen were probably involved.|$|E

25|$|Missions {{flown by}} the 366th TFW {{consisted}} generally of two types—MiG-CAP patrols to protect strike aircraft from attack by marauding North Vietnamese fighters and fighter-bomber strikes {{carried out with}} iron bombs against ground targets. The MiG patrols and attacks in North Vietnam were {{taken over by the}} F-4s and F-105s based in Thailand, which could carry a larger bomb load further and faster. In addition, the F-105 was built to take the extreme <b>structural</b> <b>loads</b> of low-level, high-speed flight, whereas the F-100 was not. Consequently, the F-100D fighter bombers generally operated only in South Vietnam where the F-100 {{turned out to be a}} very effective ground support aircraft, and beat back many enemy attacks.|$|E
25|$|During flight testing, the snag on {{the leading}} edge of the stabilators was filled in, and the gap between the leading-edge {{extensions}} (LEX) and the fuselage mostly filled in. The gaps, called the boundary layer air discharge (BLAD) slots, controlled the vortices generated by the LEX and presented clean air to the vertical stabilizers at high angles of attack, but they also generated a great deal of parasitic drag, worsening the problem of the F/A-18's inadequate range. McDonnell filled in 80% of the gap, leaving a small slot to bleed air from the engine intake. This may have contributed to early problems with fatigue cracks appearing on the vertical stabilizers due to extreme <b>Structural</b> <b>loads,</b> resulting in a short grounding in 1984 until the stabilizers were strengthened. Starting in May 1988, a small vertical fence was added to the top of each LEX to broaden the vortices and direct them away from the vertical stabilizers. This also provided a minor increase in controllability as a side effect. F/A-18s of early versions had a problem with insufficient rate of roll, exacerbated by the insufficient wing stiffness, especially with heavy underwing ordnance loads.|$|E

Of particular note was a [...] "floating" [...] foundation—a reinforced concrete slab that provided the building's weight with a solid platform atop Chicago's notoriously swampy soil. [...] The term {{for the type of}} foundation that Root designed is grillage foundation, a foundation where iron rails and the structural beams are combined in a crisscross pattern and encased in concrete to support the building's immense weight without heavy foundation stones.

40|$|Conventional {{aircraft}} generally employ mixing algorithms or {{lookup tables}} to determine control surface deflections {{needed to achieve}} moments commanded by the flight control system. Control allocation {{is the problem of}} converting desired moments into control effector commands. Next generation aircraft may have many multipurpose, redundant control surfaces, adding considerable complexity to the control allocation problem. These issues can be addressed with optimal control allocation. Most optimal control allocation algorithms have control surface position and rate constraints. However, these constraints are insufficient to ensure that the aircraft's <b>structural</b> <b>load</b> limits will not be exceeded by commanded surface deflections. In this paper, a framework is proposed to enable a flight control system with optimal control allocation to incorporate real-time <b>structural</b> <b>load</b> feedback and <b>structural</b> <b>load</b> constraints. A proof of concept simulation that demonstrates the framework in a simulation of a generic transport aircraft is presented...|$|R

[...] Basin heaters, tower draindown, and other freeze protection methods are often employed in cold climates. Operational cooling towers with malfunctions can freeze during very cold weather. Typically, freezing {{starts at the}} corners of a cooling tower with a reduced or absent heat load. Severe freezing conditions can create growing volumes of ice, resulting in increased <b>structural</b> <b>loads</b> which can cause structural damage or collapse.|$|E

2500|$|At 8.9 {{seconds before}} launch, {{the first stage}} {{ignition}} sequence started. The center engine ignited first, followed by opposing outboard pairs at 300-millisecond intervals to reduce the <b>structural</b> <b>loads</b> on the rocket. When thrust had been confirmed by the onboard computers, the rocket was [...] "soft-released" [...] in two stages: first, the hold-down arms released the rocket, and second, as the rocket began to accelerate upwards, it was slowed by tapered metal pins pulled through dies for half a second. Once the rocket had lifted off, it could not safely settle back down onto the pad if the engines failed. The astronauts considered {{this one of the}} tensest moments in riding the Saturn V, for if the rocket did fail to lift off after release they had a low chance of survival given the large amounts of propellant. A fully fueled Saturn V exploding on the pad would have released the energy equivalent of two kilotons of TNT. To improve safety, the Saturn Emergency Detection System (EDS) inhibited engine shutdown for the first 30 seconds of flight. (See Saturn V Instrument Unit) ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Structural</b> <b>loading</b> {{produced}} by an impacting vortex is a hazardous phenomenon that is encountered in numerous applications {{ranging from the}} destruction of residences by tornados to the chopping of tip vortices by rotors. Adequate design of structures to resist vortex-induced <b>structural</b> <b>loading</b> necessitates study of the phenomenon that control the <b>structural</b> <b>loading</b> {{produced by}} an impacting vortex. This body of work extends the current knowledge base of vortex-structure interaction by evaluating {{the influence of the}} relative vortex-to-structure size on the <b>structural</b> <b>loading</b> that the vortex produces. A computer model is utilized to directly simulate the two-dimensional impact of an impinging vortex with a slender, cylindrical structure. The vortex’s tangential velocity profile (TVP) is defined by a normalization of the Vatistas analytical (TVP) which realistically replicates the documented spectrum of measured vortex TVPs. The impinging vortex’s maximum tangential velocity is fixed, and the vortex’s critical radius is incremented from one to one-hundred times the structure’s diameter. When the impinging vortex is small, it interacts with vortices produced on the structure by the free stream, and maximum force coefficient amplitudes vary by more than 400 % when the impinging vortex impacts the structure at different times. Maximum drag and lift force coefficient amplitudes reach asymptotic values as the impinging vortex’s size increases that are respectively 94. 77 % and 10. 66 % less than maximum force coefficients produced by an equivalent maximum velocity free stream. The vortex produces maximum <b>structural</b> <b>loading</b> when its path is shifted above the structure’s centerline, and maximum drag and lift force coefficients are respectively up to 4. 80 % and 34. 07 % greater than maximum force coefficients produced by an equivalent-velocity free stream. Finally, the dynamic load factor (DLF) concept is used to develop a generalized methodology to assess the dynamic amplification of a structure’s response to vortex loading and to assess the dynamic loading threat that tornados pose. Typical civil and residential structures will not experience significant response amplification, but responses of very flexible structures may be amplified by up to 2. 88 times...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Wheel-Rail {{systems are}} intensively {{subjected}} to {{damage caused by}} rolling contact and slip behaviour between the wheel and the rail. This is caused because of the brake block pushed against the wheel tread to create friction through which energy is dissipated. Friction also generates heat which results in distortion of the wheel as well as thermal stresses. In order to accurately predict this phenomena an accurate understanding of the thermal and <b>structural</b> <b>loading</b> on the wheel is required. In this paper this type of problem is being discussed. Two applications are presented.
