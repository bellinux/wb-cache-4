5000|$|The idea {{to hold a}} World's Fair {{to commemorate}} the {{completion}} of the Bay Bridge and Golden Gate Bridge started from a letter to the San Francisco News in February 1933. Architects W.P. Day and George Kelham were assigned to consider the merits of potential sites around the city, including Golden Gate Park, China Basin, Candle <b>Stick</b> <b>Point,</b> and Lake Merced. By 1934, the choice of sites had been narrowed to the areas adjoining the two bridges: either [...] "an island built up from shallow water" [...] north of Yerba Buena Island which would go on to be named Treasure Island, or the Presidio, which had previously been used in 1915 for the Panama-Pacific International Exposition. Yerba Buena Shoals was chosen as the site in February 1935. In August 1935, a $10 million proposal using federal WPA funds for construction work was advanced, and in October of that year, Leland W. Culter, president of San Francisco Bay Exposition, Inc., announced that President Roosevelt had approved [...] to help fund the cost of reclaiming land at Yerba Buena Shoals.|$|E
40|$|The mobile Internet {{of things}} on the ocean is {{significant}} {{for the development of}} marine economy. Meanwhile, the existing systems, such as AIS and LRIT, can’t meet the requirement of the mobile Internet of things. After analyzing weaknesses of them, it is found that the poor capacity of ocean communication is the <b>stick</b> <b>point</b> to build the Internet {{of things on}} the ocean. Then, the proposal based on the COFDM technology for improving it is put forward. By upgrading the analog shortwave radios into high-speed digital radios with the audio modem, a fundamental architecture for the Internet of things on the ocean can be built. At last, a way based on software-defined radio to realize the proposal is introduced, and the technical characteristics together with prospect of the technology are revealed...|$|E
40|$|Syntax use by {{non-human}} animals {{remains a}} controversial issue. We present here {{evidence that a}} dog may respond to verbal requests composed of two independent terms, one referring to an object {{and the other to}} an action to be performed relative to the object. A female mongrel dog, Sofia, was initially trained to respond to action (point and fetch) and object (ball, key, stick, bottle and bear) terms which were then presented as simultaneous, combinatorial requests (e. g. ball fetch, <b>stick</b> <b>point).</b> Sofia successfully responded to object-action requests presented as single sentences, and was able to flexibly generalize her performance across different contexts. These results provide empirical evidence that dogs are able to extract the information contained in complex messages and to integrate it in directed performance, an ability which is shared with other linguistically trained animals and may represent a forerunner of syntactic functioning.

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{resistance}} training the so-called ‘‘sticking point’’ is commonly understood as the 9 position in a lift in which a disproportionately large increase in the difficulty to continue the lift is experienced. If the lift is taken {{to the point of}} momentary muscular failure, the <b>sticking</b> <b>point</b> is usually where the failure occurs. Hence the <b>sticking</b> <b>point</b> is associated with an increased chance of exercise form deterioration or break-down. Understanding the mechanisms that lead to the occurrence of <b>sticking</b> <b>points</b> as well as different training strategies {{that can be used to}} overcome them is important to strength practitioners (trainees and coaches alike) and instrumental for the avoidance of injury and continued progress. In this article we survey and consolidate the body of existing research on the topic: we discuss different definitions of the <b>sticking</b> <b>point</b> adopted in the literature and propose a more precise definition, describe different muscular and biomechanical aspects that give rise to <b>sticking</b> <b>points,</b> and review the effectiveness of different training modalities used to address them.

40|$|Since it {{was first}} {{observed}} and especially so in recent years, {{the phenomenon of the}} so-called "sticking point" in resistance training has attracted a substantial amount of sports and exercise science research. Broadly speaking the <b>sticking</b> <b>point</b> is understood as the position in the range-of-motion of a lift at which a disproportionately large increase in the difficulty to continue the lift is experienced. Hence the <b>sticking</b> <b>point</b> is inherently the performance bottleneck and is also associated with an increased chance of exercise form deterioration or breakdown. Understanding the aspects of lifting performance which should be analysed in order to pinpoint the cause of a specific <b>sticking</b> <b>point</b> and therefore devise an effective training strategy to overcome it, is of pervasive importance to strength practitioners and instrumental for the avoidance of injury and continued progress. In this paper we survey a range of physiological and biomechanical mechanisms which {{contribute to the development of}} <b>sticking</b> <b>points,</b> and led by this insight review and analyse the findings of the existing observational research on the occurrence of <b>sticking</b> <b>points</b> in three ubiquitous exercises: the bench press, the squat, and the deadlift. The findings of our analysis should be used to inform future research and current resistance training practice. Publisher PDFPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The Colony in the Fog is {{the story}} of transplanted fourth grader Eric Baker, who has moved with his family from Ohio to Virginia to {{facilitate}} his father's eye surgery. During a history lecture, Eric loses his concentration and his teacher assigns him to research and report on the Lost Colony at Roanoke. A series of adventures leads Eric to discover the actual colonists, allowing him to complete his research firsthand. The story emerges from research within three different disciplines: the history of the Lost Colony at Roanoke, writing children's literature, and an analysis of existing children's literature about the Lost Colony. The history of the colony and speculations as to the fate of the colonists provide a basis for a story, which discovers that the colonists had relocated to the Chesapeake Bay as they had intended to do in 1587. Research by such historians as David Beers Quinn and David <b>Stick</b> <b>point</b> to the likelihood of such a move. The research on how to write children's books provided different views of structure, plot and character development. Finally, the existing children's literature on the Lost Colony gave an indication of the historical information about the Colony that children have been exposed to, a condensed version of which became Eric's explanation {{of the history of the}} Colony, as well as the basis for a fictionalization of events subsequent to the last meeting of the Colonists with Governor John White in 1587.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the acute effects of the ‘Slingshot’ on bench-press performance, prime-mover surface electromyographic (sEMG) amplitude, and barbell velocity during maximal and submaximal bench-pressing in competitive male powerlifters. Fifteen male powerlifters (mean } SD age: 27. 05 ± 5. 94 years; mass: 94. 15 kg; 1 RM bench-press: 139. 7 ± 16. 79 kg) participated in the study. Bench-press strength, average barbell velocity, and sEMG amplitude of the prime mover muscles (triceps brachii, pectoralis major and anterior deltoid) were measured during two conditions; ‘Raw’ (without use of any assistance) and ‘Slingshot’ [using the ‘Slingshot’ to perform both the weight achieved during ‘Raw’ 1 RM testing (Raw max/SS), and absolute 1 RM using the ‘Slingshot’ (SS) ]. The {{results showed that the}} ‘Slingshot’ significantly increased bench press 1 RM performance by a mean } SD of 20. 67 kg } 3. 4 kg. Barbell velocity and <b>stick</b> <b>point</b> analysis indicate that this improvement is likely driven by an increase in peak and pre-stick barbell velocity as triceps RMS was lower throughout all rep max phases with the ‘Slingshot’. The ‘Slingshot’ also caused reductions in RMS, specifically of the triceps at all rep ranges but barbell velocity was better maintained in the last reps of all sets. These data indicate that the ‘Slingshot’ specifically de-loaded the triceps muscle throughout all rep ranges and provide assistance to maintaining barbell velocity under fatigue during later repetitions of multiple-repetition sets. The ‘Slingshot’ training aid could therefore be used in de-load phases of bench press training or as an over-reaching and velocity training aid...|$|E
