5|$|Natural predators of the California {{spiny lobster}} include bony fish {{such as the}} California sheephead, giant sea bass and cabezone, sharks {{including}} the horn shark and leopard shark, octopuses and sea otters. In response to an approaching predator, spiny lobsters including the California spiny lobster can produce a loud noise using the <b>stick-slip</b> phenomenon, akin to a bowed instrument. The bases of the antennae act as a plectrum, which is rubbed over a file {{on the edge of}} the antennular plate. If a predator is very close, spiny lobsters will flex their muscular tail in order to escape the predator, backwards.|$|E

25|$|A <b>stick-slip</b> motor works {{using the}} inertia {{of a mass}} and the {{friction}} of a clamp. Such motors can be very small. Some are used for camera sensor displacement, thus allowing an anti-shake function.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} {{stepping}} <b>stick-slip</b> motor, all these motors {{work on the}} same principle. Driven by dual orthogonal vibration modes with a phase difference of 90°, the contact point between two surfaces vibrates in an elliptical path, producing a frictional force between the surfaces. Usually, one surface is fixed, causing the other to move. In most piezoelectric motors, the piezoelectric crystal is excited by a sine wave signal at the resonant frequency of the motor. Using the resonance effect, a much lower voltage {{can be used to}} produce a high vibration amplitude.|$|E
25|$|Friction dampers {{tend to be}} {{available}} in two major types, linear and rotational and dissipate energy by heat. The damper operates {{on the principle of}} a coulomb damper. Depending on the design, friction dampers can experience <b>stick-slip</b> phenomenon and Cold welding. The main disadvantage being that friction surfaces can wear over time and for this reason they are not recommended for dissipating wind loads. When used in seismic applications wear is not a problem and there is no required maintenance. They have a rectangular hysteretic loop {{and as long as the}} building is sufficiently elastic they tend to settle back to their original positions after an earthquake.|$|E
25|$|Tectonic {{earthquakes}} occur {{anywhere in}} the earth where there is sufficient stored elastic strain energy to drive fracture propagation along a fault plane. The sides of a fault move past each other smoothly and aseismically only {{if there are no}} irregularities or asperities along the fault surface that increase the frictional resistance. Most fault surfaces do have such asperities and this leads to a form of <b>stick-slip</b> behavior. Once the fault has locked, continued relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress and therefore, stored strain energy in the volume around the fault surface. This continues until the stress has risen sufficiently to break through the asperity, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault, releasing the stored energy. This energy is released as a combination of radiated elastic strain seismic waves, frictional heating of the fault surface, and cracking of the rock, thus causing an earthquake. This process of gradual build-up of strain and stress punctuated by occasional sudden earthquake failure {{is referred to as the}} elastic-rebound theory. It is estimated that only 10 percent or less of an earthquake's total energy is radiated as seismic energy. Most of the earthquake's energy is used to power the earthquake fracture growth or is converted into heat generated by friction. Therefore, earthquakes lower the Earth's available elastic potential energy and raise its temperature, though these changes are negligible compared to the conductive and convective flow of heat out from the Earth's deep interior.|$|E

5000|$|Examples of <b>stick-slip</b> can {{be heard}} from {{hydraulic}} cylinders, tractor wet brakes, honing machines etc. Special dopes {{can be added to}} the hydraulic fluid or the cooling fluid to overcome or minimize the <b>stick-slip</b> effect. <b>Stick-slip</b> is also experienced in lathes, mill centres, and other machinery where something slides on a slideway. Slideway oils typically list [...] "prevention of stick-slip" [...] as one of their features. Other examples of the <b>stick-slip</b> phenomenon include the music that comes from bowed instruments, the noise of car brakes and tires, and the noise of a stopping train. <b>Stick-slip</b> also has been observed in articular cartilage in mild loading and sliding conditions, which could result in an abrasive wear of the cartilage. Another example of the <b>stick-slip</b> phenomenon occurs when musical notes are played with a glass harp by rubbing a wet finger along the rim of a crystal wine glass. One animal that produces sound using <b>stick-slip</b> friction is the spiny lobster which rubs its antennae over smooth surfaces on its head. Another, more common example which produces sound using <b>stick-slip</b> friction is the grasshopper.|$|E

5000|$|Below is a simple, {{heuristic}} {{description of}} <b>stick-slip</b> phenomena using classical mechanics that is relevant for engineering descriptions. However, in actuality, {{there is little}} consensus in academia regarding the actual physical description of <b>stick-slip</b> which follows the lack of understanding about friction phenomena in general. The generally agreed upon view is that <b>stick-slip</b> behavior results from common phonon modes (at the interface between the substrate and the slider) that are pinned in an undulating potential well landscape that un-pin (slip) and pin (stick) primarily influenced by thermal fluctuations.|$|E

50|$|<b>Stick-slip</b> {{can also}} be {{observed}} on the atomic scale using a friction force microscope. In such case, the phenomenon can be interpreted using the Tomlinson model.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stick-slip</b> can be {{described}} as surfaces alternating between sticking to each other and sliding over each other, with a corresponding change in the force of friction. Typically, the static friction coefficient (a heuristic number) between two surfaces is larger than the kinetic friction coefficient. If an applied force is large enough to overcome the static friction, then the reduction of the friction to the kinetic friction can cause a sudden jump in the velocity of the movement. The attached picture shows symbolically an example of <b>stick-slip.</b>|$|E

They can withstand the loads in CSP applications, are weather and corrosion resistant and also offer low and constant friction (no <b>stick-slip</b> effect) over the mechanism’s life cycle.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{stringed}} instruments {{such as the}} violin, viola, cello, {{and double}} bass also exhibit inharmonicity when notes are plucked using the pizzicato technique. However, this inharmonicity disappears when the strings are bowed, because the bow's <b>stick-slip</b> action is periodic, so it drives all of the resonances of the string at exactly harmonic ratios, even if it has to drive them slightly off their natural frequency. As a result, the operating mode of a bowed string playing a steady note is a compromise among the tunings {{of all of the}} (slightly inharmonic) string resonances, which is due to the strong non-linearity of the <b>stick-slip</b> action. [...] Mode locking also occurs in the human voice and in reed instruments such as the clarinet.|$|E
50|$|Within the {{electronic}} production, precision requirements increase greatly. This {{is due to}} smaller components and a technological change, e.g. chip-on board, flip-chip technology or wafer-level-chip packaging. A repeatability accuracy of less than 10 µm is required. Roller bearings do not achieve this because of their <b>Stick-slip</b> phenomenon and “a tight drawer” effect.|$|E
50|$|Surface texture {{is one of}} the {{important}} factors that control friction and transfer layer formation during sliding. Considerable efforts have been made to study the influence of surface texture on friction and wear during sliding conditions. Surface textures can be isotropic or anisotropic. Sometimes, <b>stick-slip</b> friction phenomena can be observed during sliding depending on surface texture.|$|E
50|$|For {{load-bearing}} applications, CNT powders {{are mixed}} with polymers or precursor resins to increase stiffness, strength and toughness. These enhancements depend on CNT diameter, aspect ratio, alignment, dispersion and interfacial interaction. Premixed resins and master batches employ CNT loadings from 0.1 to 20 wt%. Nanoscale <b>stick-slip</b> among CNTs and CNT-polymer contacts can increase material damping, enhancing sporting goods, including tennis racquets, baseball bats and bicycle frames.|$|E
50|$|During the {{scanning}} process with an AFM or FFM, the tip, sliding on the sample’s surface, passes through both low (stable) and high potential energy points, determined, for instance, by atomic positions or, {{on a larger}} scale, by surface roughness. Without considering thermal effects, the only force that makes the tip overcome these potential barriers is the spring force given by the support: this causes the <b>stick-slip</b> motion.|$|E

Software that solves NSDS systems exists, such as INRIA's Siconos.|$|E

5000|$|Bowing (Italian: arco) is {{a method}} used in some string instruments, {{including}} the violin, viola, cello, and the double bass (of the violin family), and the old viol family. The bow consists of a stick with a [...] "ribbon" [...] of parallel horse tail hairs stretched between its ends. The hair is coated with rosin so it can grip the string; moving the hair across a string causes a <b>stick-slip</b> phenomenon, making the string vibrate, and prompting the instrument to emit sound.|$|E
50|$|High-frequency flutter, above 100 Hz, can {{sometimes}} result from tape vibrating {{as it passes}} over a head (or other non-rotating element in the tape path), {{as a result of}} rapidly interacting stretching in the tape and <b>stick-slip</b> at the head. This is termed 'scrape flutter'. It adds a roughness to the sound that is not typical of wow & flutter, and damping devices or heavy rollers are sometimes employed on professional tape machines to reduce or prevent it. Scrape flutter measurement requires special techniques, often using a 10 kHz tone.|$|E

5000|$|When {{a string}} is struck or plucked, as with pizzicato, sound waves are {{generated}} {{that do not}} belong to a harmonic series as when a string is bowed. [...] This complex timbre is called inharmonicity. The inharmonicity of a string depends on its physical characteristics, such as tension, composition, diameter and length. The inharmonicity disappears when strings are bowed because the bow's <b>stick-slip</b> action is periodic, so it drives all of the resonances of the string at exactly harmonic ratios, even if it has to drive them slightly off their natural frequency.|$|E

A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, including dehydration, thermal runaway, and phase change.The geothermal gradient can be lowered where cool material from the surface sinks downward, increasing the strength of the surrounding mantle, and allowing earthquakes to occur down to a depth of 400 km and 670 km.|$|E
