This could be seen as similar to a Southern blot, however the interaction is between a DNA molecule(the aptamer) and a protein, rather than two DNA molecules.

40|$|Chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) binds to the {{envelope}} membrane of actively dividing chloroplasts (plastids) in young pea leaves. <b>South-western</b> <b>blotting</b> {{was used to}} identify and characterize the protein involved in the binding of cpDNA to {{the envelope}} membrane. A 130 kDa protein in the inner chloroplast (plastid) envelope membrane binds specific sequences within the cpDNA. These included a 0. 41 kbp sequence located upstream of the psaAB gene, a 0. 57 kbp sequence located downstream of the petA gene and a 1. 2 kbp sequence located within the rpoC 2 gene. The protein was detected in the envelope membrane of young pea leaves in which the cpDNA had been located by fluorescence microscopy at the chloroplast periphery, whereas it was undetectable in mature leaves. We therefore propose that the 130 kDa protein {{is involved in the}} binding of cpDNA to the envelope membrane, and named it plastid envelope DNA-binding protein...|$|E
40|$|We have {{identified}} and characterized a DNA-binding activity with specificity for the β-globin direct repeat element (βDRE) from rat βbminy-globin promoter, an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional regulatory element in mammalian adult β-globin promoters. We have also {{confirmed that the}} βDRE contributed to the transcriptional inducibility of rat βbminy-globin gene in rat erythroleukemia (REL) cells. By using gel mobility shift and <b>South-Western</b> <b>blot</b> competition studies we have shown that 60 kD erythroid-specific transcription factor and 35 kD and 20 kD ubiquitous factors from rat erythroleukemia cells specifically bind to the βDRE from the rat βbminy-globin promoter. Additionally, {{a significant increase in}} the quantity of 60 kD transcription factor was observed upon erythroid differentiation of REL cells...|$|R
40|$|Oncogenic {{transformation}} of fibroblasts by the src oncogene {{has long been}} known to cause an increase in the size of cell-surface protein-bound oligosaccharides, owing primarily to increased N-glycan branching mediated by increased beta- 1, 6 -N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT V) activity. The src-responsive element of the GnT V promoter was localized to Ets-binding sites and the promoter was transcriptionally stimulated by both ets- 1 and ets- 2 expression [Buckhaults, Chen, Fregien and Pierce (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 19575 - 19581; Kang, Saito, Ihara, Miyoshi, Koyama, Sheng and Taniguchi (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 26706 - 26712]. Because GnT V action requires the prior action of beta- 1, 2 -N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase II (GnT II) and the human GnT II promoter contains four putative Ets-binding sites [Chen, Zhou, Tan and Schachter (1998) Glycoconj. J. 15, 301 - 308], GnT II might also be under oncogenic control via Ets transcription factors. We now report that co-transfection into HepG 2 or COS- 1 cells of either ets- 1 or ets- 2 expression plasmids together with chimaeric GnT II promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmids results in a 2 - 4 -fold stimulation of promoter activity. Mobility-shift assays and <b>South-Western</b> <b>blots</b> localized the functional Ets-binding site to one of the four putative sites on the GnT II promoter. The GnT II promoter, unlike the GnT V promoter, is not activated by either src or neu. Therefore although both promoters are stimulated {{by a member of the}} Ets family of transcription factors, the functional role of this Ets transcriptional control seems to be different for the two genes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCharacterization {{of human}} foamy virus (HFV) gag-encoded {{precursors}} {{and the search}} for a Gag-Pol polyprotein and mature proteins derived from proteolytic processing were carried out in HFV-infected cells and with purified preassembled cores and extracellular virus by Western blotting and radioimmunoprecipitation using antisera against synthetic peptides corresponding to putative Gag and protease proteins. Precursor proteins, Pr 78 gag/ 74 gagand Pr 135 pol, were found in the nucleus of epithelial and fibroblast cells 3 – 4 days after HFV infection. Kinetic analysis of HFV Pr 78 gagand Pr 74 gagindicated that Pr 78 gagis a precursor to Pr 74 gag. <b>South-Western</b> <b>blot</b> analysis indicated that Pr 78 gagand Pr 74 gaghave properties associated with nucleic acid binding protein although they lack the typical zinc-finger motifs found in retroviral nucleocapsid proteins. Western blot analyses of preassembled HFV cores isolated from the cytoplasm of infected cells and purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation demonstrated the presence of Pr 78 gag/ 74 gagand Pr 135 pol, but no proteolytically processed Gag proteins were observed. The majority of extracellular HFV particles were found to have pentagon-shaped cores, as observed intracellularly, and are believed to be the immature extracellular form of the virus. The highest concentration of extracellular particles, estimated by EM, Western blot, and reverse transcriptase assays were found in sucrose gradient fractions having a density of 1. 21 – 1. 24 g/cm 3. Western blot analysis revealed that Pr 78 gag/ 74 gagand Pr 135 polwere the major viral proteins associated with these extracellular particles, as only small amounts of putative proteolytically cleaved capsid (p 32) were observed. Our results support the notion that Pol is translated independent of Gag in HFV-infected cells...|$|R
40|$|Nucleolin, a major {{nucleolar}} protein, forms {{a specific}} complex with the genome (a single-stranded DNA molecule of minus polarity) of parvovirus MVMp in vitro. By means of <b>South-western</b> <b>blotting</b> experiments, we mapped the binding site to a 222 -nucleotide motif within the non-structural transcription unit, {{referred to as}} NUBE (nucleolin-binding element). The specificity of the interaction was confirmed by competitive gel retardation assays. DNaseI and nuclease S 1 probing showed that NUBE folds into a secondary structure, in agreement with a computer-assisted conformational prediction. The whole NUBE may be necessary for the interaction with nucleolin, {{as suggested by the}} failure of NUBE subfragments to bind the protein and by the nuclease footprinting experiments. The present work extends the previously reported ability of nucleolin to form a specific complex with ribosomal RNA, to a defined DNA substrate. Considering the tropism of MVMp DNA replication for host cell nucleoli, these data raise the possibility that nucleolin may contribute to the regulation of the parvoviral life-cycle...|$|E
40|$|Jun oncoprotein, a {{component}} of transcription factor AP- 1, is responsible for expression of multiple genes which trigger cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The diverse regulatory roles that c-Jun plays point towards its varied and complex transcriptional regulation under different physiological conditions. This could possibly involve an interplay of different trans-acting factors and multiple cis-acting elements present in the c-jun. It is, therefore, important to identify such regulatory elements that could be involved in its stringent up- or down-regulation. In the present study, transient transfection analysis with stepwise deletion variants of the upstream region (563 to 273), linked to basal c-jun promoter in a reporter plasmid revealed the existence of multiple regulatory regions that modulated gene expression. Further delineation of the region, conferring positive regulation of transcription from the c-jun promoter, led to the identification of a cis-acting element spanning 538 to 514 region. The trans-acting factor(s) present in rat liver nuclear extract interacted specifically only in the phosphorylated form, and with a high affinity to the recognition sequence. UV cross-linking and <b>South-western</b> <b>blotting,</b> {{in conjunction with the}} analysis of affinity purified proteins interacting with this region, revealed that at least two protein factors of 45 kDa and 34 kDa bind specifically to this region...|$|E

To clarify the regulatory mechanisms of differential expression of two p 97 proteins of C. elegans, we performed detailed deletion {{analysis of their}} promoter regions. We found that the promoter of cdc- 48. 1 contains two regions necessary for embryonic and for post-embryonic expression, while the promoter of cdc- 48. 2 contains the single region necessary for embryonic expression. In particular, two elements (Element A and Element B) and three conserved boxes (Box a, Box b and Box c) were essential for cdc- 48. 1 expression in embryos and at post-embryonic stages, respectively. By using <b>South-Western</b> <b>blotting</b> and MALDI-TOF MS analysis, we identified HMG- 12 and CAR- 1 as proteins that bind to Element A and Element B, respectively, from the embryonic nuclear extract. Importantly, we found the decreased expression of p 97 in embryos prepared from hmg- 12 (RNAi) or car- 1 (RNAi) worms. These results indicate that both HMG- 12 and CAR- 1 play important roles in embryonic expression of cdc- 48. 1...|$|E
40|$|Since {{abnormal}} {{expression of}} {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor (EGFR) is frequently associated with cancer development, the analysis of EGFR gene expression {{at the transcriptional level}} as well as the transcript level is helpful to understand the abnormal nature of cancer growth. In this study, we attempted to localize EGFR transcriptional factors, EGFR specific transcription factor (ETF) and GC factor (GCF), in the frozen sections of A 431 human epidermoid tumor transplated into nude mice by southwestern histochemistry. As probes for southwestern histochemistry, (+) and (-) sequences of the DNA seqment (91 base pairs (bp)) including ETF and GCF regulatory element were synthesized, allowed to be annealed and then tailed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase with digoxigenin (Dig) - 11 -dUTP. The sites of Dig were visualized enzyme-immunohistochemically with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-Dig. The 91 bp probe detected effectively a single ETF band with a molecular mass of 120 kD on a <b>south-western</b> <b>blot</b> of the crude nuclear fraction extracted from A 431 tumor cells, but not a GCF band. When the frozen sections of A 431 tumor were fixed with 4 % paraformal-dehyde and reacted with the 91 bp probe, the staining of perinuclear area as well as nuclei in a speckled pattern were observed and the staining intensity was increased depending upon the concentrations of the probe and reached a plateu level at 0. 5 - 1 μg/ml. Moreover, the nuclear staining with the probe was dependent upon a salt concentration and the signal/noise ratio was a maximam at 150 mM NaCl. The staining with the 91 bp probe was abolished by the presence of an excess amount of unlabeled 91 bp DNA or unlabeled ETF responsive element DNA alone, but not by that of unlabeled GCF DNA, indicating that the nuclear and perinuclear staining with the 91 bp probe reflects the localization of ETF. Thus, southwestern histochemistry can be a novel tool to analyze cellular expression of gene-specific transcription regulatory factors...|$|R

40|$|Ribozymes {{are short}} strands of RNA that possess a huge {{potential}} as biological tools for studying gene expression and as therapeutic agents to down-regulate undesirable gene expression. Successful application of ribozymes requires delivery {{to the target}} site in sufficient amounts for an adequate duration. However, due to their large size and polyanionic character ribozymes are not amenable to transport across biological membranes. In this study a chemically modified ribozyme with enhanced biological stability, targeted against the EGFR mRNA has been evaluated for cellular delivery to cultured glial and neuronal cells {{with a view to}} developing treatments for brain tumours. Cellular delivery of free ribozyme was characterised in cultured glial and neuronal cells from the human and rat. Delivery was very limited and time dependent with no consistent difference observed between glial and neuronal cells in both species. Cellular association was largely temperature and energy-dependent with a small component of non-energy dependent association. Further studies showed that ribozyme cellular association was inhibited with self and cross competition with nucleic and non-nucleic acid polyanions indicating the presence of cell surface ribozyme-binding molecules. Trypsin washing experiments further implied that the ribozyme binding surface molecules were protein by nature. Dependence of cellular association on pH indicated that interaction of ribozyme with cell surface molecules was based on ionic interactions. Fluoresence studies indicated that, post cell association, ribozymes were sequestered in sub-cellular vesicles. <b>South-Western</b> <b>blots</b> identified several cell surface proteins which bind to ribozymes and could facilitate cellular association. The limited cellular association observed with free ribozyme required the development and evaluation of polylactide-co-glycolide microspheres incorporating ribozyme for enhanced cellular delivery. Characterisation of microsphere mediated delivery of ribozyme in cultured glial and neuronal cells showed that association increased by 18 to 27 -fold in all cell types with no differences observed between cell lines and species. Microsphere mediated delivery was temperature and energy dependent and independent of pH. In order to assess the potential of PLGA micro spheres for the CNS delivery of ribozyme the distribution of ribozyme entrapping microspheres was investigated in rat CNS after intracerebroventricular injection. Distribution studies demonstrated that after 24 hours there was no free ribozyme present in the brain parenchyma, however microsphere entrapped ribozyme was found in the CNS. Microspheres remained in the ventricular system after deposition and passed from the lateral ventricles to the third and fourth ventricle and in the subarachnoid space. Investigation of the influence of microsphere size on the distribution in CNS demonstrated that particles up to 2. 5 and O. 5 f. lm remained in the ventricles around the choroid plexus and ependymal lining...|$|R
40|$|We {{have shown}} that human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) gene {{expression}} is negatively regulated by the U 5 repressive element (U 5 RE) of its long terminal repeat (LTR). To isolate factors binding to U 5 RE, we screened a cDNA expression library by <b>south-western</b> <b>blotting</b> with a U 5 RE probe. Screening 2 x 10 (6) clones gave a positive clone with a 3. 8 kb insert encoding a novel 671 residue polypeptide, named HTLV-I U 5 RE binding protein 1 (HUB 1), with five zinc finger domains and a Krüppel-associated box like domain; HUB 1 {{may be related to}} a repressor belonging to the Krüppel type zinc finger protein. A 4. 0 kb mRNA for HUB 1 is ubiquitously expressed among all human tissues tested. HUB 1 recognizes the TCCACCCC sequence as a core motif and exerts a strong repressive effect on HTLV-I LTR-mediated expression. A new repressive domain, named HUB 1 repressive (HUR) domain, was identified, rather than the Krüppel-associated box like domain. The N-terminal region upstream of HUR domain seemed to be also indispensable to the repression. Thus, we propose that HUB 1 is a new type repressor and {{plays an important role in}} the HTLV-I U 5 -mediated repression...|$|E
40|$|Footprinting {{experiments}} {{involving the}} human thyroglobulin gene enhancer and thyroid nuclear extracts revealed a protected region called X 2, containing an incomplete cAMP-responsive element (CRE). Band-shift experiments identified two binding activities recognizing the X 2 element: a CRE-binding protein (CREB) /activating transcription factor (ATF) relative that binds the half CRE motif {{and a second}} factor that interacts with a G-rich motif located just upstream from the CRE. The first factor appears to be CREB itself, {{as indicated by the}} supershifting when using an antibody directed against CREB, and the second DNA-binding activity involved was shown to be zinc-dependent and exhibited an apparent molecular mass of 42 - 44 kDa in <b>South-Western</b> <b>blotting</b> experiments. This factor may represent a novel entity, which we named CAF, for 'CREB Associated Factor'. Three copies of X 2 sequence conferred a strong cAMP-dependent transcriptional activation to a heterologous promoter in transient transfection assay in cAMP-stimulated primary thyrocytes and HeLa cells. Transfection experiments of constructs containing the X 2 element mutated in either the CRE or the G-rich site showed that both motifs were required for this transcription activating function. Moreover, the combination of several individual X 2 elements mutated in either the CRE or the G-rich motif did not exhibit full transcriptional activity. This suggests that, {{in the context of the}} X 2 element, CREB requires a close interaction with CAF to achieve both basal and cAMP-dependent transcriptional activation.

40|$|DNA-protein cross-linkages {{were formed}} in intact nuclei of chicken {{erythrocytes}} and liver cells by {{the action of}} cis-diammine dichloroplatinum (II). Most cross-linked proteins were components of the nuclear matrix, and their heterogeneity reflected the different complexity of liver and erythrocytes matrices, respectively. Some basic proteins, including histones, were also cross-linked, particularly in erythrocyte nuclei. <b>South-Western</b> <b>blotting</b> revealed that a variety of proteins isolated from the cross-linked liver nuclei recognized DNA specifically. In this group of proteins two relatively abundant, acidic, species of 38 and 66 kDa, respectively, might represent novel DNA-binding proteins from the nuclear matrix. In the case of erythrocytes, only the basic proteins showed a DNA-recognition capacity, and among them there were some unidentified species, absent from liver. Lamin B 2 was cross-linked but was unable to recognize DNA, and the same was true for other abundant, cross-linked proteins from both types of nuclei. This led to the hypothesis that for some DNA-nuclear matrix interactions the aggregation typical of matrix proteins is essential for the specificity of DNA recognition. Hybridization analysis of the DNA isolated from the cross-linked complexes showed that SARs (scaffold attachment regions) and telomeric sequences were well represented in the cross-linked fragments, that the cross-linked DNA of liver was partially different from that of erythrocytes and that two defined SAR sequences were found to be present only in the cross-linked DNA. These results are in agreement with the present views on DNA-nuclear matrix interactions, which are usually studied on isolated nuclear matrices or purified proteins. Instead, our results provide experimental evidence obtained directly from intact nuclei...|$|E

This work was devoted to establishing a reliable procedure to select proteins {{on the basis of their}} interaction with a nucleic acid probe chosen to fold into a given structure. 2 D-electrophoresis and mass spectrometry were combined for protein identification. We applied this procedure to select and identify triplex-binding activities in HeLa nuclear extracts. To achieve this, we used a panel of deoxyribonucleic probes adopting intramolecular triple-helices, varying in their primary sequence, structure or triple-helix motif. A limited number of spots was reproducibly revealed by <b>South-western</b> <b>blotting.</b> Spots of interest were localised among a complex population of 35 S-labelled proteins according to their 32 P-specific emission.

The identities of several of them were confirmed by comparing western and South-western blots on the same membrane using specific antibodies. The recognition specificity of most of these proteins is large, according to previous reports and our own experiments.
