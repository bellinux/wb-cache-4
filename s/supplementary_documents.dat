25|$|When ICD-9 was {{published}} by the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Classification of Procedures in Medicine (ICPM) was also developed (1975) and published (1978). The ICPM surgical procedures fascicle was originally created by the United States, based on its adaptations of ICD (called ICDA), which had contained a procedure classification since 1962. ICPM is published separately from the ICD disease classification {{as a series of}} <b>supplementary</b> <b>documents</b> called fascicles (bundles or groups of items). Each fascicle contains a classification of modes of laboratory, radiology, surgery, therapy, and other diagnostic procedures. Many countries have adapted and translated the ICPM in parts or as a whole and are using it with amendments since then.|$|E

This manuscript serves as <b>supplementary</b> <b>document</b> for our letter to the Editor {{to appear in the}} Journal of Neuroscience.

40|$|Here {{we provide}} a {{thorough}} {{discussion of the}} model for Min protein dynamics proposed by Schweizer et al. [11]. The manuscript serves as <b>supplementary</b> <b>document</b> for our {{letter to the editor}} to appear in PNAS. Our analysis is based on the original COMSOL simulation files that were used for the publication. We show that all computational data in Schweizer et al. rely on exploitation of simulation artifacts and various unmentioned modifications of model parameters that strikingly contradict the experimental setup and experimental data. We find that the model neither accounts for MinE membrane interactions nor for any observed MinDE protein patterns. All conclusions drawn from the computational model are void. There is no evidence at all that persistent MinE membrane binding has any role in geometry sensing. Comment: <b>supplementary</b> <b>document,</b> 24 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

This underlying tension between the physical and the conceptual has imparted a multi-dimensional complexity to the term […]. Kevin Gray and Susan Gray What is a building? To begin to extrapolate our reasons for posing this question, consider the context of ‘Further Reading’, and the <b>supplementary</b> <b>documents</b> this supposes. To those whose profession {{is dedicated to the}} design of buildings, and whose professional life is, all too often, beleaguered by impediments threatening the actualisation, the construction, of their design, <b>supplementary</b> <b>documents</b> are not simply footnotes to design but evidence of struggles over design control. Within this trajectory, law is, most frequently, figured as yet another problematic. But consider a rather different trope – one which uses aspects of legal thinking, or rather thinking through law, to re-engage with the idea of ‘a building’ and of ‘design’. <b>Supplementary</b> <b>documents,</b> in this sense, become a ‘supplement’ which we could characterise as an ‘excess’. Documents which before might have been marginalised now become reconstituted as artefacts, evidencing other accounts of the processes of architecture. Legal artefacts related to design and building, which evidence a series of techniques and strategies for diagramming rights and responsibilities, may be deployed to open new perspectives on the question of ‘What is a building?...|$|E

Making subwavelength-sized structural elements from these metals seriously limits the optical performance of a device, however, and complicates the manufacturing process of nearly all metamaterial devices in the optical wavelength range.
