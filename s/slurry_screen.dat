Hard carbon {{particles}} ({{much larger than the}} ore particle sizes) can be mixed with the ore and cyanide solution mixture. The gold cyanide complex is adsorbed onto the carbon until it comes to an equilibrium with the gold in solution. Because the carbon particles are much larger than the ore particles, the coarse carbon can then be separated from the <b>slurry</b> by <b>screening</b> using a wire mesh.|$|R
30|$|Electrode {{material}} for supercapacitor fabrication was prepared using activated carbon (AC) derived from areca fibres [34] using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder dissolved in N-methylpyrrolidone (3 : 1 ratio). PVDF binder solution was mixed with AC in 0.3 : 1 weight ratio and grinded {{by means of}} pestle and mortar to form slurry. The obtained <b>slurry</b> was <b>screen</b> printed (200  µm mesh size) on two stainless steel electrodes. The thicknesses of the coated AC layer on electrodes were around 30  µm having weight of ~ 2 to 3  mg each. The supercapacitor cell was constructed using SPE sandwiched between two prepared AC-coated electrodes. The unit cell was sealed in a plastic-coated aluminium pouch keeping the two wires outside. We also fabricated a cell with 2  mol dm− 3 H 2 SO 4 solution without SPE using polypropylene sheet as separator. Electrochemical characterization {{was carried out by}} CV, AC impedance and GCD studies. All the electrochemical studies were carried out using a BioLogic SP- 150 instrument.|$|R
40|$|Thermophilic Bacillus spp. {{isolated}} from {{thermophilic aerobic digestion}} (TAD) of model agricultural <b>slurry</b> were <b>screened</b> for ability to secret linamarase activity and degrade linamarin, a cyanogenic glycoside toxin abundant in cassava. Screening was performed by both linamarin - picrate assay and by p-nitrophenyl β-d-glucoside (PNPG) degradation, and results of both assays were related. Linamarase positive isolates were identified as Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus licheniformis and Bacillus stearothermophilus. Enzyme production was growth related and peak production was reached in 48 h in B. coagulans and 36 h in B. stearothermophilus. B. coagulans produced over 40 times greater activity than B. stearothermophilus. Enzyme productivity in shake flask was not strictly related to screening assay result. Crude enzyme of B. coagulans was optimally active at 75 °C while that of B. stearothermophilus was optimally active at 80 °C and both had optimum activity at pH 8. 0. The thermophilic and neutrophilic- to marginally alkaline activity of the crude enzymes could be very useful in the detoxification and reprocessing of cyanogens containing cassava wastes by TAD for use in animal nutrition...|$|R
40|$|Composite film (ComFi) {{technology}} has been developed as an alternative technique to achieve thick (5 – 100 ?m) films at temperatures compatible with silicon processing. The technique entails producing a composite slurry consisting of PZT powder and a PZT producing sol. The slurry is then deposited onto the substrate, dried and fired at 710 °C. Intermediate sol infiltration and pyrolysis {{can be used to}} increase the density and improve the functional properties of the films. A <b>slurry</b> suitable for <b>screen</b> printing has been developed and used to print PZT thick films. The dielectric and piezoelectric properties of the screen printed material are presented.

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this project is to {{identify}} and test concentrates made from preparation plant fines as to their amenability as fee for slurry-fed, slagging, entrained-flow gasifiers. The high sulfur content and high BTU value of Illinois coals are particularly advantageous in such a gasifier. Elemental sulfur is recovered as a revenue-producing product in gasifier technologies, and the higher BTU Illinois coal concentrate requires less water to produce a pumpable slurry than western coal (30 [...] 35 % vs 45 %) thereby {{reducing the amount of}} heat lost in vaporization of entrained water. This means that 66 tons of Illinois coal concentrate, containing 13, 000 BTU per pound, at 70 % solids would provide as much net heat as 100 tons of 9500 BTU coal pumped at 54 % solids. During the current reporting period twelve 55 -gallon drums of preparation plant fines were obtained from a mine in Illinois. Part of the <b>slurry</b> was <b>screened</b> on 60 mesh to remove coarse material (about 9. 57 %) and the fines were used for preliminary flotation tests in a subaeration cell. Fifteen batch tests were conducted to establish flotation conditions for operation of the continuous flow column flotation unit. Varying the type and quantities of reagents, grades were recorded over 12, 000 BTU and the recovery of combustible matter or BTU varied from 41. 6 % to 88. 2 %...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{goal of this}} {{investigation}} was to isolate competent polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons degraders that can utilize polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons of former industrial sites at McDoel Switchyard in Bloomington, Indiana. Using conventional enrichment method based on soil <b>slurry,</b> we isolated, <b>screened</b> and purified two bacterial species strains PB 1 and PB 2. Applying the ribotyping technique using the 16 S rRNA gene analysis, the strains were assigned to the genus Pseudomonas (Pseudomonas plecoglossicida strain PB 1 and Pseudomonas sp. PB 2). Both isolates showed promising metabolic capacity on pyrene sprayed MS agar plates during the preliminary investigations. Using time course studies in the liquid cultures at calculated concentrations 123, 64, 97 and 94 ppm for naphthalene, chrysene, fluroanthene and pyrene, P. plecoglossicida strain PB 1 and Pseudomonas sp. PB 2 showed partial utilization of the polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons. Naphthalene was degraded between 26 % and 40 %, chrysene 14 % and 16 %, fluroanthene 5 % and 7 %; pyrene 8 % and 13 % by P. plecoglossicida strain PB 1 and Pseudomonas sp. PB 2 respectively. Based on their growth profile, we developed a model R 2 = 1 to predict the degradation rate of slow polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon-degraders where all the necessary parameters are constant. From {{this investigation}}, we confirm that the former industrial site soil microbial communities may be explored for the biorestoration of the industrial site...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{efficient}} and versatile types of modern dredges is the cutter suction dredge. Specific regulations mandate the placement of screens over the suction mouth during dredging operations to prevent ordnance, wildlife, and other debris from entering the system; however, these screens change the operational capability of the dredge {{in the form of}} an additional minor loss. The goal of this experiment was to determine the effects of different dredge operating parameters ? cutter head speed, ladder arm swing speed, flow rate, and screen opening area ratio ? on a screen?s calculated minor loss coefficient (or k-value). The Haynes Coastal Engineering Laboratory and Center for Dredging Studies at Texas A&M University houses a model cutter suction dredge that is used to test various parameters associated with hydraulic dredging. Testing consisted of 121 test dredge runs, which included water-only runs and slurry runs, at three flow rates, three swing speeds, three cutter head speeds, and three screen configurations. Minor loss coefficients were calculated for each test run and qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. The results showed that neither cutter head speed nor swing speed had a significant, direct correlation with the screen?s minor loss in the range of selected parameters; however, they did have an indirect effect on k-value through an increased specific gravity in the <b>slurry.</b> The <b>screen</b> opening area ratio (?) showed a direct correlation with the screen?s k-value and was quantified for water tests and sand tests {{in the form of an}} empirical equation which can be applied to both model and prototype cutter suction dredges. The k-values for different screen opening shapes showed an upward or downward shift in the overall k-value curves, indicating the possibility of inherent efficiencies for differently-shaped openings. Qualitative observations of the Haynes Laboratory model dredge included sediment spillage at high cutter head speeds and a sand bulldozer effect at low cutter head speeds. Future testing should focus on a wider range of cutter head speeds and swing speeds to determine if any correlation exists beyond the ranges tested in this experiment. Additional testing of screens with more ?-values and different screen opening shapes would increase the resolution and precision of the proposed k-value prediction equations...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen {{generation}} from {{gasoline is}} essentially {{one of the}} critical technologies for the commercialization of small-scale fuel cells auxiliary/backup power systems. so catalysts suitable for autothermal reforming (ATR) of gasoline are desperately needed. La 0. 8 Ce 0. 2 NiO 3 with a crystal structure of perovskite was developed both in pellet and on cordierite substrate by citrate method. Autothermal reforming of gasoline or its surrogates. n-octane with or without thiophene additive, was carried out on either bulk perovskite pellet or monolithic perovskite catalyst. During the 220 -h long-term test, the pellet catalyst exhibited high thermal stability and activity with hydrogen yield approaching to the theoretical maximum value and only minor amount of CH 4 slipping through. It possessed fairly good sulfur tolerance, almost immune to 5 ppmw sulfur although could still be seriously poisoned when subjected to high concentration of sulfur or gasoline. The monolithic perovskite catalysts were developed by <b>screening</b> <b>slurries,</b> binders as well as Substrates with or without pre-washcoating CeZrO 2. The monolithic La- 0. 8. Ce 0. 2 NiO 3 formed in situ on the raw cordierite monolith could be an effective catalyst for ATR of gasoline, exhibiting superior performance to the catalyst of 0. 3 wt. %Rh/CeO 2 -ZrO 2 /Cordierite at a temperature range 650 - 800 degrees C. On whatever the pellet or monolithic catalysts, the active sites were presumably the in situ reduced Ni- 0 which were well dispersed and stabilized by the perovskite crystal structure. The good performances of La 0. 8 Ce 0. 2 NiO 3, better thermal stability and immunity to carbon foul and sulfur poison than LaNiO 3 could be ascribed to the increased oxygen mobility {{with the presence of}} sesquioxide of cerium.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Cape Technikon, 2000. Internationally, {{there is}} an {{increase}} in the need for safer environmental processes that can be applied to mining operations, especially on a small scale, where mercury amalgamation is the main process used for the recovery of free gold. An alternative, more environmentally acceptable, process called the Coal Gold Agglomeration (CGA) process has been investigated at the Cape Technikon. This paper explains the application of flotation as a means of separation for the CGA process. The CGA process is based on the recovery of hydrophobic gold particles from ore slurries into agglomerates formed from coal and oil. The agglomerates are separated from the <b>slurry</b> through scraping, <b>screening,</b> flotation or a combination of the aforementioned. They are then ashed to release the gold particles, after which it is smelted to form gold bullion. All components were contacted for fifty minutes after which a frother was added and after three minutes of conditioning, air, at a rate of one I/min per cell volume was introduced into the system. The addition of a collector (Potassium Amyl Xanthate) at the start of each run significantly improved gold recoveries. Preliminary experiments indicated that the use of baffles decreased the gold recoveries, which was concluded to be due to agglomerate breakage. The system was also found to be frother-selective and hence only DOW- 200 was used in subsequent experiments. A significant increase or decrease in the air addition rate both had a negative effect on the recoveries; therefore, the air addition rate was not altered during further tests. The use of tap water as opposed to distilled water decreased the attainable recoveries by less than five per cent. This was a very encouraging result, in terms of the practical implementation of the CGA process...|$|R
