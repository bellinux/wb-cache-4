50|$|The base/{{junction}} rules (J-rules) of junction grammars are {{a set of}} algebraic formulas which generate {{for natural}} language what is akin to the Periodic Table of elements in chemistry, namely, an enumeration of well-formed linguistic structures {{sometimes referred to as}} the Periodic Chart of Constituent structures (PCCS). J-rules generate composite structures consisting of the labeled operands entering into them plus the relations established by operators, and assign a category to the composite produced, to wit: X ∘ Y ≐ Z. Composites thus generated become potential operands for subsequent operations. The resulting algebra may be represented in <b>string</b> <b>form</b> (e.g., infix, postfix, reverse polish) or graphed as a branching diagram (J-tree).|$|E

This is because Transact-SQL allows conversion from [...] and [...] types to numbers, and monetary data in <b>string</b> <b>form</b> may contain currency indicator characters such as the [...] or [...] symbols. The same is true of VBScript, where any string that can be converted to a currency value in the current locale is considered to be numeric. VBScript does not, however, consider dates and times to be numeric.|$|E

Since Chuck Wayne was an advanced classic guitarist {{as well as}} a plectrum player, he combined the two forms to play octaves.

His left hand used the [...] "skip one" [...] <b>string</b> <b>form,</b> which is using the index finger for the low note and the fourth finger for the upper note.

50|$|For digital {{signatures}} all of thischanges. Documents are immaterial {{because the}} information is represented by logical bits that can bestored on, and copied to, any suitable electronic medium, and they only become meaningful to humanswhen represented through an analogue physical medium such as a computer screen or a printout. Thevalidity of a digital document is authenticated by verifying that the digital signature logicallymatches the bit string representation of the document. Because a digital document in its bit <b>string</b> <b>form</b> can not beobserved or interpreted directly by the signer, the digital signature should only serve {{as evidence of the}} signer’s agreementto the high level semantic interpretation of the document, although technically speaking it represents thesigner’s agreement to the bit string document itself. For human signers, digital signatures should in fact be interpreted as an agreement to the analogue representation of documents e.g. on a computer screen. Highly complex instruments are now needed notonly for interpreting the document but also for producing the digital signature. The complexity of the instruments needed to interpret and visualize the digital document determines the semantic distance between its bit sting representation and its semantic interpretation.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} F and D-term cosmic <b>strings</b> <b>formed</b> in supersymmetric theories. Supersymmetry {{is broken}} inside the string core, but restored outside. In global SUSY, this implies {{the existence of}} goldstino zero modes, and the string potentially carries fermionic currents. We show that these zero modes do not survive the coupling to gravity, due to the super Higgs mechanism. Therefore the superconductivity and chirality properties are different in global and local supersymmetry. For example, a <b>string</b> <b>formed</b> {{at the end of}} D-term inflation is chiral in supergravity but non-chiral in global SUSY. Comment: 14 pages, no figure...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{describes}} a novel method for measuring structural similarity of proteins in three dimensions. The method gets its roots from computational linguistics {{and the related}} techniques for modeling protein structure in <b>string</b> <b>form</b> and pairwise comparison of protein sequences. The method uses n-gram based modeling techniques for capturing regularities in protein structure sequences and joints cross-entropy measures for comparing two protein sequences to do similarity test. In this way, the 3 D- structure of protein is represented in <b>string</b> <b>form</b> and, then, a similarity test is performed over these sequences. To find an overlap between two protein structures in 3 D-space, a superposition task is also applied. In order to confirm the validity of this method, some experiments were performed using a collection of the protein data sets on publicly available servers which showed that the method is efficient...|$|E

40|$|In the Yang-Mills theory, the {{apparent}} {{thickness of the}} confining string is known to grow logarithmically when its length increases. The same logarithmic broadening also happens to strings in other quantum field theories and domain walls in statistical physics models. Even in quantum field theories, the correlators used to measure and characterise this phenomenon are analogous to those in statistical physics. In this paper we describe it using the <b>string</b> <b>form</b> factor which is a meaningful quantum observable, obtainable in principle from scattering experiments. We show how the form factor {{can be obtained from}} field correlation functions calculated in lattice Monte Carlo simulations. We apply this method to 2 + 1 -dimensional scalar theory in the strong coupling limit, where it is equivalent to the 3 D Ising model, and through duality also to 2 + 1 -dimensional Z_ 2 gauge theory. We measure the <b>string</b> <b>form</b> factor by simulating the Ising model, and demonstrate that it displays the same logarithmic broadening as observed by other quantities.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that it is {{possible}} for bound fermions on a cosmic string to form a superconducting state. Due to the attractive force between them, particles moving in opposite directions along the <b>string</b> <b>form</b> bound pairs. This involves a similar mechanism to superconductivity in metals at low temperatures. The method of Gorkov is used to analyse the system. In contrast to the situation in metals, the unusual properties of the string fermion spectrum allow a massless Abelian gauge field to provide the required attractive force. This results in far stronger superconductivity than usual. A massive gauge field can also be used, in which case the standard results apply. ...|$|E
30|$|For the {{structure}} space, an existing tree edit distance is used that is obtained through a sequence alignment procedure and the minimization {{of the cost}} for transforming one tree into the other, allowing deletions, insertions and relabeling of nodes as edit operations [54]. Similarly, the distance measure for the transition states starts with an alignment procedure. This can either {{be done on the}} graph representation or a unique <b>string</b> <b>form</b> of the transition state [65]. Edit operations include substitution of atoms, rearrangement of electron re-ordering, substitution of bonds and increase/decrease of transition state size. The cost of the edit operations rises in this order, atom substitution thus being the cheapest operation. The total cost for transforming one transition state to the other is then minimized.|$|E
