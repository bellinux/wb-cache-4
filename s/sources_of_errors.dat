25|$|In the 2011 Faster-than-light {{neutrino}} anomaly, the OPERA collaboration published results {{which appeared}} {{to show that the}} speed of neutrinos is slightly faster than the speed of light. However, <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> were found and confirmed in 2012 by the OPERA collaboration, which fully explained the initial results. In their final publication, a neutrino speed consistent with the speed of light was stated. Also subsequent experiments found agreement with the speed of light, see measurements of neutrino speed.|$|E
25|$|The November main analysis, {{which showed}} an early arrival time of 57.8nanoseconds, was {{conducted}} blind to avoid observer bias, whereby those running the analysis might inadvertently fine-tune the result toward expected values. To this end, old and incomplete values for distances and delays {{from the year}} 2006 were initially adopted. With the final correction needed not yet known, the intermediate expected result was also an unknown. Analysis of the measurement data under those 'blind' conditions gave an early neutrino arrival of 1043.4nanoseconds. Afterward, the data were analyzed again taking into consideration the complete and actual <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>errors.</b> If neutrino and light speed were the same, a subtraction value of 1043.4nanoseconds should have been obtained for the correction. However, the actual subtraction value amounted to only 985.6nanoseconds, corresponding to an arrival time 57.8nanoseconds earlier than expected.|$|E

Descriptions of how each <b>of</b> these <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> occurs in mail surveys are provided.

2500|$|A more {{critical}} input is the [...] "forcing" [...] by wind fields: a time-varying map of wind speed and directions. The most common <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> in wave model results are the {{errors in the}} wind field. [...] Ocean currents can also be important, in particular in western boundary currents such as the Gulf Stream, Kuroshio or Agulhas current, or in coastal areas where tidal currents are strong. Waves are also affected by sea ice and icebergs, and all operational global wave models take at least the sea ice into account.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{there are}} pseudo-statements in which occur only {{meaningful}} words; these pseudo-statements are formed in a counter-syntactical way. An {{example is the}} word sequence [...] "Caesar is a prime number"; every word has a definite meaning, but the sequence has no meaning. The problem is that [...] "prime number" [...] is a predicate of numbers, not a predicate of human beings. In the example the nonsense is evident; however, in natural language the rules of grammar do not prohibit the formation of analogous meaningless word sequences that are not so easily detectable. In the grammar of natural languages, every sequence of the kind [...] "x is y", where x is a noun and y is a predicate, is acceptable. In fact, in the grammar there is no distinction between predicate which can be affirmed of human beings and predicate which can be affirmed of numbers. So [...] "Caesar is a general" [...] and [...] "Caesar is a prime number" [...] are both well-formed, in contrast for example with [...] "Caesar is and", which is ill-formed. In a logically constructed language—says Carnap—a distinction between the various kinds of predicate is specified, and pseudo-statements as [...] "Caesar is a prime number" [...] are ill-formed. Now, {{and this is the}} main point of Carnap's argument, metaphysical statements in which meaningless words do not occur, are indeed meaningless because they are formed in a way which is admissible in natural languages, but not in logically constructed languages. Carnap attempts to indicate the most frequent <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> from which metaphysical pseudo-statements can arise. One source of mistakes is the ambiguity of the verb [...] "to be", which is sometimes used as a copula ("I am hungry"), and sometimes to designate existence ("I am"). The latter statement incorrectly suggests a predicative form, and thus it suggests that existence is a predicate. Only modern logic, with the introduction of an explicit sign to designate existence (the sign [...] ), which occurs only in statements such as , never as a predicate, has shown that existence is not a predicate, and thus has revealed the logical error from which pseudo-statements such as [...] "cogito, ergo sum" [...] has arisen.|$|E

40|$|While {{one most}} often thinks <b>of</b> <b>error</b> from {{sampling}} variability, the total-survey-error paradigm establishes {{that there are}} many different <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> in surveys and that they may involve both random error (or variance) and systematic error (or bias) (Smith, 2005).
