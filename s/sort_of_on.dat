Spader is a funny actor for Seinfeld to feature in its ninth season, but his turn here comes at the start of his fallow period, after he was in Crash and then basically never appeared in a commercial movie again, but well before his career revival in The Practice and Boston Legal. He's actually perfect casting for the role of sarcastic recovering alcoholic Jason Hanky—it's never hard to buy Spader as a jerk, and his recovery clearly hasn't quite cured him of his jerkdom.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a fuzzy reward {{function}} for improving the learning efficiency of reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is a <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>on</b> line learning approach. During the learning process, learning system (often called an agent) learns how to operate in the environment, basing upon the effect of action action—reward reward signal. Actually, the reward signal is always represented with a reward function, of which the role is to evaluate whether the agent acts well or not. According to the distribution of rewards in the space of states, reward function can be classified as two basic forms, dense function and sparse function. Parse function has the advantage of the easy implementation, but its learning efficiency is relatively low. As for dense function, it is very difficult to design when the size of state space is very large. In response to these defects, we present a methodology for designing a fuzzy uzzy reward functions by the use of fuzzy inference system. As a result of this solution, not only generalization ability of reward function can be improved, but also we are apt to embed expert experience in reinforcement learning system. Through applying the fuzzy reward function to R-learning and making simulation experiment, we verify that the learning efficiency for R-learning is effectively improved.
