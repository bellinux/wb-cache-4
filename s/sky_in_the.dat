5|$|Charing Cross was {{a central}} staging post for coaches, but the {{congested}} narrow road was a frequent scene of accidents; here, a bonfire has caused the Salisbury Flying Coach to overturn. Festive bonfires were usual but risky: a house fire lights the <b>sky</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distance. A link-boy blows on the flame of his torch, street-urchins are playing with the fire, and one of their fireworks is falling in at the coach window.|$|E
5|$|In the 2016 UCI World Tour season-long competition, the top 10 of {{the standings}} {{remained}} relatively unchanged after the race.

Tinkoff remained ahead of Team <b>Sky</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> team rankings; in the nations' rankings, Australia moved back into the lead, with Belgium moving into second and pushing Spain into third.|$|E

5|$|As {{the race}} reached the summit, Romain Bardet attacked, {{and the bottom}} had gained a twenty-second {{advantage}} over the front group of around thirty riders, increasing it to one minute {{at the foot of}} the Pra-Loup climb. Sky again controlled the head of the chase, with Vincenzo Nibali, Alejandro Valverde and Wilco Kelderman the notable riders distanced. Chris Froome launched an attack in the final , with Tejay van Garderen and Beñat Intxausti following. Van Garderen dropped Intxausti and passed Froome to take second place, thirty-six seconds behind stage winner Bardet. The new leaders in the classifications were Van Garderen in the general, Bardet in the young riders' and <b>Sky</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> team standings.|$|E
5|$|Capella {{is closer}} to the north {{celestial}} pole than any other first magnitude star. Its northern declination is such that it is actually invisible south of latitude 44°S—this includes southernmost New Zealand, Argentina and Chile as well as the Falkland Islands. Conversely it is circumpolar north of 44°N: for the whole of the United Kingdom, Canada and the northernmost United States, the star never sets. Capella and Vega are {{on opposite sides of the}} pole, at about the same distance from it, such that an imaginary line between the two stars will nearly pass through Polaris. Visible halfway between the Belt of Orion and Polaris, Capella is at its highest in the night sky at midnight in early December and is regarded as a prominent star of the winter <b>sky</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Le Verrier {{by letter}} urged Berlin Observatory {{astronomer}} Johann Gottfried Galle to search with the observatory's refractor. Heinrich d'Arrest, {{a student at}} the observatory, suggested to Galle that they could compare a recently drawn chart of the <b>sky</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region of Le Verrier's predicted location with the current sky to seek the displacement characteristic of a planet, as opposed to a fixed star. On the evening of 23 September 1846, the day Galle received the letter, he discovered Neptune within 1° of where Le Verrier had predicted it to be, about 12° from Adams' prediction. Challis later realised that he had observed the planet twice, on 4 and 12 August, but did not recognise it as a planet because he lacked an up-to-date star map and was distracted by his concurrent work on comet observations.|$|E
50|$|Delta Canis Majoris is <b>the</b> third-brightest star <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{constellation}} after Sirius and Adhara, with {{an apparent}} magnitude of +1.83, and is white or yellow-white in colour. Lying about 10 degrees south southeast of Sirius, it only rises to about 11 degrees {{above the horizon}} at the latitude of the United Kingdom. The open cluster NGC 2354 is located only 1.3 degrees east of Delta Canis Majoris. As {{with the rest of}} Canis Major, Wezen is most visible <b>in</b> winter <b>skies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern hemisphere, and summer <b>skies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern. <b>In</b> Bayer's Uranometria, it is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Great Dog's hind quarter.|$|R

5|$|Opposite the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand is the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, {{formerly}} Old Trafford's {{main stand}} and previously {{known as the}} South Stand. Although only a single-tiered stand, the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand contains most of the ground's executive suites, and also plays host to any VIPs who may come to watch the match. Members of the media are seated {{in the middle of}} the Upper South Stand to give them the best view of the match. The television gantry is also in the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, so the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand is the one that gets shown on television least often. Television studios are located at either end of the Sir Bobby Charlton Stand, with the club's in-house television station, MUTV, in the East studio and other television stations, such as the BBC and <b>Sky,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West studio.|$|E
5|$|The first chorus has Koda {{walking through}} the land, and scenes of her singing. She grabs a compass, {{but it does not}} {{function}} properly.

As more smoke falls and black leaves con-stellate, Koda collapses and sings the bridge on the ground. When the bridge section ends, rocks start levitating and the smoke rises, forming a black Dust devil in the distance. As more dust devil's form, they become large and closely devour Koda.|$|E
5|$|The inaugural champions were Sarita and Wilde, who {{defeated}} The Beautiful People (Rayne and <b>Sky)</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> finals of an eight-team tournament to crown {{the first}} TNA Knockouts Tag Team Champions.

As of June 27, 2013, the championships are retired due to TNA not having enough female talent for a Tag Team Division. Young is the first and only male wrestler to have held the title.

5|$|The {{original}} idea was based around {{the premise of}} creating a town like those found in a role-playing game. The team chose the design elements of a fractured, floating world due to their wish to portray a <b>sky</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game, which is usually not possible with an isometric camera, as it always points down. They also wanted to forgo a map system, and felt that having the ground {{come up to the}} Kid allowed the player to easily see without a map where they had already been in a level. The story of the Calamity was created as a way to explain this game mechanic. Jen Zee developed the art style of the game to express beauty in a post-apocalyptic landscape. The hand-painted style was intended to soften the sharpness she saw as typical in isometric games and the colorless, harsh depictions of most devastated landscapes. Zee was inspired by the pixel art landscapes of earlier Japanese isometric games.|$|E
5|$|The video {{introduces}} a sober, contemplative side of Madonna, revealing a mature mysticism. It {{begins with the}} camera skimming along a cracked, desiccated desert floor, and within seconds Madonna appears, hovering just above {{the ground in the}} distance. Her hands are covered with mehndi and an enigmatic symbol on one palm. In the video she slowly gestures and sways her arms toward the <b>sky</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> video, desperately pleading to her cold lover cited in the song. At one point Madonna falls, and as she hits the ground, she transforms into a flock of large, dark birds. Later, she transforms into a black dog. Three Madonnas also appear walking and crawling amid the desert throughout the video. As the song progresses, the sky darkens, and Madonna levitates from the ground. Her form then changes to a shiny black liquid, which runs along the desert floor and appears to be absorbed by the tattooed hands of another Madonna, who is curled up on the crenellated ground. The video ends with a desperate and melancholy Madonna.|$|E
5|$|William Herschel was {{the first}} {{astronomer}} to attempt to determine the distribution of stars in the sky. During the 1780s he established a series of gauges in 600 directions and counted the stars observed along each line of sight. From this he deduced {{that the number of}} stars steadily increased toward one side of the <b>sky,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direction of the Milky Way core. His son John Herschel repeated this study in the southern hemisphere and found a corresponding increase in the same direction. In addition to his other accomplishments, William Herschel is also noted for his discovery that some stars do not merely lie along the same line of sight, but are also physical companions that form binary star systems.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of 1/2 November 1942, the Eighth Army {{attacked}} again in the north, with 2nd New Zealand Division in the lead. Freyberg placed 151 Brigade {{on the right and}} 152 Brigade on the left. The aim was to attack directly westwards across the Rahman track, with the infantry leading the night assault and 9th Armoured Brigade (now commanded by Brigadier John C. Currie) again passing through to break the enemy gun line and allow X Corps to break out. The assault went to plan except that opposition on the left was heavier than expected which slowed the advance. As a result, the advancing tanks were highlighted against the dawn <b>sky</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> east and began to be picked off by Axis anti-tank fire. The Regiment was in the centre of the 9th Armoured Brigade, and the CO lost touch with both his artillery support and close anti-tank support. In the growing light, the B squadron commander (Major M.StJ.V.Gibbs) realised that he was in a ring of enemy anti-tank guns, ahead and to both flanks. He gave the order to 'Charge' and B Squadron overran the anti-tank positions, losing some vehicles but destroying the enemy gun line. Meanwhile, the 21st Panzer Division was counter-attacking A and C Squadrons and at 4pm the Regiment (now down to four tanks) was withdrawn. The 1st Armoured Division from X Corps were just behind the 9th Armoured Brigade but there were no liaison officers between the units and 1st Armoured did not take the opportunity to push on through the broken Axis gun-line.|$|E

25|$|Pisces is {{classified}} as a short ascension sign; one which takes a shorter {{amount of time to}} ascend over the horizon than the other signs.
