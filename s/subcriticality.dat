To devise a representative measure of the <b>subcriticality</b> level, the mathematical and physical implications of the effective multiplication factor and the source multiplication factor have been reviewed. A set of criteria that bound the feasible <b>subcriticality</b> level is proposed {{in terms of the}} effective multiplication factor; the minimum required <b>subcriticality</b> is determined by the largest value of potential reactivity increase including the temperature defect and the calculation and measurement uncertainties, and the maximum allowable <b>subcriticality</b> level is bounded by the system economy and the technical feasibility of the system. Within this feasible domain of <b>subcriticality,</b> a preliminary estimation of the optimal range of <b>subcriticality</b> was performed for a lead-bismuth-eutectic (LBE) cooled ADS design based on the safety and transmutation performances.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is an {{investigation}} of the performance of the so-called source modulation technique for the measurement of reactivity in subcritical, source-driven cores. Methods of measuring reactivity by a single detector, including the source modulation method, are based on the assumption of point kinetic behaviour of the core. Deviations from point kinetic behaviour will lead to an inaccurate estimation of the reactivity. Hence, first, the conditions of point kinetic behaviour in subcritical source-driven cores are revisited. In addition to the known conditions for such behaviour, which have an analogy to those in critical cores, some additional cases are found which only exist in subcritical cores. Then the performance of the source modulation technique is investigated. It is found that the error of the method, originally thought to be due exclusively to the deviation of the local detector signal from the amplitude factor of point kinetics, remains finite and non-zero even in the limit of exact point kinetic behaviour (e. g., with low frequencies or deep <b>subcriticalities).</b> This is demonstrated and explained by analytical formulae. Some remedies for this shortcoming of the method are also suggested and discussed...|$|R
40|$|An {{effective}} method of calculating the pulsed Feynman-alpha formula for finite width pulses is introduced and applied in this paper. The method {{is suitable for}} calculating both the deterministic and the stochastic Feynman-alpha formulae, while also being capable of treating various pulse shapes through very similar steps and partly identical formulae. In the paper both the deterministic and the stochastic cases are treated for square and Gaussian pulses. The solutions show a very good agreement {{with the results of}} currently performed experiments by some of the authors at the Kyoto University Critical Assembly (KUCA). The formulae obtained are also used for a quantitative evaluation of the prompt neutron decay constant from a large number of experiments made at the KUCA {{for a wide range of}} parameters such as subcritical reactivity, pulse repetition frequency and pulse width. The suitability of the formulae to determine the prompt neutron decay constant a by curve fitting to the measured data was investigated. It was found that, despite the larger deviation from the traditional Feynman Y(T) -curves from the traditional ones with a constant source (i. e., larger ripples superimposed on a smooth curve), the stochastic pulsing method is superior to the deterministic one in that it yields the correct a value for all <b>subcriticalities.</b> The deterministic method also works fine for most cases, but its application is not so straightforward...|$|R
40|$|The Reactor Accelerator Coupling Experiments (RACE) are {{a set of}} {{neutron source}} driven {{subcritical}} experiments under temperature feedback conditions. These experiments will involve coupling an accelerator driven neutron source to a TRIGA reactor system in a subcritical configuration. The accelerator source will consist of a 40 MeV electron linear accelerator (LINAC) and a heavy metal target. The electrons from the accelerator produce bremsstrahlung radiation in the target which in turn produces a source of neutrons via photonuclear reactions. The available core at the The University of Texas at Austin (UT) with standard TRIGA fuel {{will be used to}} carry out these studies. The primary objective of this thesis was to study the feasibility of RACE especially with respect to the heat generation rates capable of placing the reactor in a temperature feedback regime. First, the accelerator target (or neutron source) was optimized for size, shape, and type of material to be used. Analyses were then performed for several arrangements of this target in the UT TRIGA reactor. One of these arrangements was found to provide heat generation rates well into the temperature feedback regime of the fuel. Lastly, a multi-target system [named the Texas Transmutation System (TTS) ] was designed to allow for more detailed accelerator driven systems (ADS) studies.

The very short neutron pulse (1 µs) provided by GENEPI, together with the possibility to change the pulse repetition rate up to 5 kHz and the different levels of sub-criticality available will facilitate a study of the reactor kinetic parameters in situations close to most of the proposed accelerator-driven Systems (ADS).

Transportation containers and storage facilities are designed such that nuclear fuels remain in a subcritical state. Such designs often involve excess conservatism {{because of the lack}} of relevant experimental data to verify the accuracy of Monte Carlo codes used in nuclear criticality safety analyses. A joint experimental research program between Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Westinghouse Safety Management Solutions, Inc., and the University of Missouri was initiated to obtain measured quantities that could be directly related to the <b>subcriticality</b> of simple arrays of Missouri University Research Reactor (MURR) fuel elements. A series of measurement were performed to assess the reactivity of materials such as BORAL, stainless steel, aluminum, and lead that are typically used in the construction of shipping casks.

In addition, a limited number of measurements were performed with configurations of fresh and spent (irradiated) fuel elements to ascertain the reactivity of the spent fuel elements. In these experiments, fresh fuel elements were replaced by spent fuel elements such that the subcritical reactivity change could be measured. The results of these measurements were used by Westinghouse Safety Management Solutions to determine the <b>subcriticality</b> of MURR fuel elements isolated by absorbing materials.

Both a lead-bismuth eutectic, sodium and gas are being considered as a coolant; each has advantages and disadvantages. The major expected advantage is that <b>subcriticality</b> avoids reactivity induced transients. The potentially large <b>subcriticality</b> margin also should allow for the introduction of very significant quantities of waste products (minor Actinides and Fission Products) which negatively impact the safety characteristics of standard cores.

In this paper we will consider uncertainties related to nuclear data only. The present knowledge of the cross sections of many isotopes that are not usually utilized in existing reactors (like Bi, Pb- 207, Pb- 208, and also Minor Actinides and Fission Products) suggests that uncertainties in the integral parameters will be significantly larger than for conventional reactor systems, and this raises concerns on the neutronic performance of those systems...|$|E
