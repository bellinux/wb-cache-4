In the summer of 1997, a disease killed more than 200 animals (two-thirds of its population) within two months, extremely compromising the species' viable population. While opinions on the precise causes of this epidemic remain divided, the most likely cause is a morbilivirus or a toxic algae bloom.|$|E

She voices her {{concerns about it}} to her eccentric father and inventor, Maurice who assures her that she is anything but strange ("No Matter What"). The two then put {{the finishing touches on}} his invention and Maurice heads off to an invention fair donning a scarf knitted for him by Belle ("No Matter What {Reprise]"), but becomes lost in the woods and attacked by a pack of wolves. After surviving a wolf attack, he enters the Beast's castle where the servants, including Lumière, a maître d' turned into a candelabra, Cogsworth, the head of household turned into a clock, Babette, a maid turned into a feather duster that <b>still</b> <b>seems</b> to retain her flirtatious tendencies, Mrs. Potts, the head of the kitchen turned into a teapot, and Chip, her son turned into a teacup.

In spite of the years that have passed and his many successes, the Phantom still longs {{to be reunited with}} her ("Til I Hear You Sing"). Meg intrudes and presses the Phantom for feedback on her performance, but he is distracted by his thoughts of Christine and dismisses Meg as an annoyance. Madame Giry is irritated that the Phantom <b>still</b> <b>seems</b> to think only of Christine after all that she and Meg have done for him over the years. Giry recounts how she and Meg helped smuggle him out of Paris and to a ship departing from Calais, on which they escaped to America. Ignoring her, the Phantom summons Miss Fleck, who appears with two other freak show performers, Dr. Gangle and Mr. Squelch. The Phantom has them dispatch a letter to Christine, inviting her to come and perform at Phantasma ("Giry confronts The Phantom/Til' I Hear You Sing (Reprise)").|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} episode of series three of Ashes to Ashes, {{the nature of his}} death is raised when Alex Drake discovers a witness {{statement}} implied to have been written by Gene Hunt with various parts blacked out, accompanied by Alex seeing visions of a man with injuries to {{the left side of his}} face dressed in police tunic and greatcoat. In the second episode, DCI Jim Keats, an officer from the Discipline and Complaints department, intent on removing Gene Hunt, states he believes Gene killed Sam Tyler. In the fifth episode, Gene destroys Tyler's clothes (which Alex had requested from Manchester) and the censored file in order to prevent her from learning the truth about his death. In the following episode, a suspect who is not only a known fantasist but appears very different physically from Sam tries to convince Alex that he is Sam Tyler after undergoing extensive plastic surgery, and that he is from the future. He quotes Sam's usual speech in the Life on Mars introductions, claiming that nobody else is real, although he <b>still</b> <b>seems</b> to be pleased when he, Gene and Alex are in the same room, calling them the 'Three Musketeers', and avoiding Alex's attempts to test him for future knowledge by claiming that such details are forgotten after too long in the past. Gene tells Alex that he helped Sam fake his own death, meaning Sam was still alive but had disappeared into thin air.|$|E

25|$|In general The Mysterious Affair at Styles is a {{considerable}} achievement for a first-off author. The country-house-party murder is a stereotype in the detective-story genre, which Christie makes no great use of. Not her sort of occasion, at least later in life, and perhaps not really her class. The family party is much more in her line, {{and this is what}} we have here. This is one of the few Christies anchored in time and space: we are in Essex, during the First World War. The family is kept together under one roof by the exigencies of war and of a matriarch demanding rather than tyrannical – not one of her later splendid monsters, but a sympathetic and lightly shaded characterisation. If the lifestyle of the family <b>still</b> <b>seems</b> to us lavish, even wasteful, nevertheless we have the half sense that we are witnessing the beginning of the end of the Edwardian summer, that the era of country-house living has entered its final phase. Christie takes advantage of this end-of-an-era feeling in several ways: while she uses the full range of servants and their testimony, a sense of decline, of break-up is evident; feudal attitudes exist, but they crack easily. The marriage of the matriarch with a mysterious nobody is the central out-of-joint event in an intricate web of subtle changes. The family is lightly but effectively characterised, and on the outskirts of the story are the villagers, the small businessmen, and the surrounding farmers – the nucleus of Mayhem Parva. It is, too, a very clever story, with clues and red herrings falling thick and fast. We are entering the age when plans of the house were an indispensable aid to the aspirant solver of detective stories, and when cleverness was more important than suspense. But here we come to a problem that Agatha Christie has not yet solved, for cleverness over the long length easily becomes exhausting, and too many clues tend to cancel each other out, as far as reader interest is concerned. These were problems which Conan Doyle never satisfactorily overcame, but which Christie would.".|$|E

Kowalewicz also stated [...] "the songs this far are unlike anything we've ever done before yet it <b>still</b> <b>seems</b> to capture the urgency of our first record". Kowalewicz stated, in an interview, that the first three albums would form a trilogy and that the new album would not be named Billy Talent IV.|$|E

He believed that the episode was not a satisfactory ending for the Millennium story. After the cancellation of Millennium, Carter called up Henriksen {{and asked if he}} would be interested in appearing in an episode of The X-Files that would wrap up the show's arc. Henriksen was excited about the episode, but when he received the script it was about zombies, much to his dismay. He noted that the episode's story was [...] "a reasonable X-File but it's not Millennium." [...] Spotnitz later admitted that the episode [...] "was not completely successful, I suppose, but <b>still</b> <b>seems</b> worth it for having brought back Lance Henriksen." ...|$|E

[...] He also attributed the quality of every track of Blackout to economic reasons, since {{one of the main}} causes album sales began to suffer during the digital era is due to the [...] "unbundling" [...] of albums in online stores – making it easier for consumers to buy some tracks rather than the entire album. Ewing explained that [...] "The Revolver blueprint for pop albums – every track good, every track a potential hit – makes more sense than ever.

500|$|Vonnegut's {{difficulties}} materialized {{in numerous}} ways; most distinctly though, was the painfully slow progress {{he was making}} on his next novel, the darkly comical Breakfast of Champions. In 1971, Vonnegut stopped writing the novel altogether. When it was finally released in 1973, it was panned critically. In Thomas S. Hischak's book American Literature on Stage and Screen, Breakfast of Champions was called [...] "funny and outlandish", but reviewers noted that it [...] "lacks substance {{and seems to be}} an exercise in literary playfulness." [...] Vonnegut's 1976 novel Slapstick, which meditates on the relationship between him and his sister (Alice), met a similar fate. In The New York Timess review of Slapstick, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said Vonnegut [...] "seems to be putting less effort into [...] than ever before", and that [...] "it <b>still</b> <b>seems</b> as if he has given up storytelling after all." [...] At times, Vonnegut was disgruntled by the personal nature of his detractors' complaints.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, New York artist Sophia Wallace {{started work}} on a {{multimedia}} project to challenge misconceptions about the clitoris. Based on O'Connell's 1998 research, Wallace's work emphasizes the sheer scope {{and size of the}} human clitoris. She says that ignorance of this <b>still</b> <b>seems</b> to be pervasive in modern society. [...] "It is a curious dilemma to observe the paradox that on the one hand the female body is the primary metaphor for sexuality, its use saturates advertising, art and the mainstream erotic imaginary," [...] she said. [...] "Yet, the clitoris, the true female sexual organ, is virtually invisible." [...] The project is called Cliteracy and it includes a [...] "clit rodeo", which is an interactive, climb-on model of a giant golden clitoris, including its inner parts, produced with the help of sculptor Kenneth Thomas. [...] "It's been a showstopper wherever it's been shown. People are hungry {{to be able to talk}} about this," [...] Wallace said. [...] "I love seeing men standing up for the clit [...] Not having access to the pleasure that is your birthright is a deeply political act." ...|$|E

The genre of the album was described by one critic as [...] "light-hearted, energetic R pop tunes". Critics compared Milian to Aaliyah.

One reviewer compared Milian to other singers of her generation, and found that [...] "while Spears has gone raunchy with 'I Love Rock 'n' Roll', Christina Aguilera down and dirty on Stripped, and even clean-cut Mandy Moore has brashly cut her hair Felicity-style, Milian <b>still</b> <b>seems</b> young and real."

Entertainment Weekly's Michael Slezak called the song [...] "a future smash hit" [...] and described it as [...] "downright verbose – packing in some sweet, new-age-y sentiments about existing in the moment, living without regret, and saying 'I love you' early and often {{to the people in}} our lives". [...] He stated that rather than being cliché the song's lyrics are [...] "winningly inspirational thanks to the conviction in Kris’ vocals". [...] Yahoo! News described it as [...] "impressive" [...] and felt that Allen's version of the song [...] "improves on the unreleased version with a nuanced vocal and a nimble, rhythmic delivery". [...] Monica Herrera of Billboard said that Allen [...] "improves" [...] the Script's version [...] "with a nuanced vocal and a nimble, rhythmic delivery".

500|$|A 2006 review asserted: [...] "Many are the {{knowledgeable}} and discriminating {{people for whom}} Rodgers and Hammerstein's South Pacific, brilliantly co-written and staged by Joshua Logan, was the greatest musical of all." [...] In 1987, however, John Rockwell of The New York Times reviewed the City Opera production, commenting that while South Pacific had been innovative for 1949, [...] "Sondheim has long since transcended its formal innovations, and the constant reprises of the big tunes sound mechanical. In 1949, South Pacific epitomized {{the concerns of the}} day– America's responsibilities {{in the world and the}} dangers of racism.... At its 1967 State Theater revival, the show struck many as dated. It <b>still</b> <b>seems</b> that way, with M*A*S*H having contemporized this same setting". [...] A 2008 Huffington Post review criticized the play as having an Orientalist and Western-centric storyline in which stereotypical natives take on [...] "exotic background roles" [...] in relation to Americans, and it characterized the relationship between Cable and Liat as underage prostitution, charging that she [...] "speaks not a word in the whole musical, only smiles and takes the Yankee to bed." [...] South Pacific is the only major American musical set in World War II, but former Marine Robert Leckie wrote his memoir of that conflict, Helmet for My Pillow, after he walked out of a performance: [...] "I have to tell the story of how it really was.

Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton from At the Movies stated that despite the problem of never seeing Weaving's face, there was good acting and an interesting plot, adding that the film is also disturbing, with scenes reminiscent of Nazi Germany. Jonathan Ross from the BBC blasted the film, calling it a [...] "woeful, depressing failure" [...] and stating that the [...] "cast of notable and familiar talents such as John Hurt and Stephen Rea stand little chance amid {{the wreckage of the}} Wachowski siblings' dismal script and its particularly poor dialogue."

The film is a visual insult." [...] On Alan Moore removing his name from the project, Burns says [...] "it's not hard to see why," [...] as well as criticising Portman's performance: [...] "Portman <b>still</b> <b>seems</b> to believe that standing around with your mouth hanging open constitutes a performance." [...] Harry Guerin from the Irish TV network RTÉ states the film [...] "works as a political thriller, adventure and social commentary and it deserves to be seen by audiences who would otherwise avoid any/all of the three". He added that the film will become [...] "a cult favourite whose reputation will only be enhanced with age."
