25|$|By 1999, the 75-year-old stadium {{was showing}} its age. Except for the turf and {{lighting}} enhancements, no substantial upgrade {{of the stadium}} had occurred since the press box was built 25 years earlier, in 1975. The OU College of Architecture was housed under the west stands and in the north end zone, until other facilities became available in 1990. The artificial turf on Owen Field had literally become threadbare before its replacement in 1981; {{it is possible that}} the poor condition of the Superturf, prior to its 1994 replacement, contributed to a crash of the Sooner Schooner during a 1993 game against Colorado. The east side of the stadium still had the original dirt flooring underneath the stands, making for a cloudy, dusty walk into the student and visitor seating sections. Restrooms were old and inadequate; paint was peeling off external walls and the areas under the stands (the east side in particular) were dark and <b>smelled</b> <b>like</b> dust.|$|E
500|$|Cobain came up {{with the}} song's title when his friend Kathleen Hanna, at the time the lead singer of the riot grrrl band Bikini Kill, wrote [...] "Kurt Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] on his wall. Hanna meant that Cobain <b>smelled</b> <b>like</b> the {{deodorant}} Teen Spirit, which his then-girlfriend Tobi Vail wore. Cobain claimed he was unaware that it was a brand of deodorant until months after the single was released, and had interpreted the slogan as having revolutionary meaning, as they had been discussing anarchism, punk rock, and similar topics.|$|E

It won't last, that's the beauty of it. When it is brought out again, hopefully it will be in a retrospective, {{and it will be a}} different dress, which is the best thing. I like the idea of it changing and evolving into something else". He later explained that the dress would be preserved and made into a type of jerky before being archived.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} Barris's claim {{of being a}} CIA assassin, Clooney commented, [...] "I don't know how much I {{believed}} it. I didn't want to officially ask him, because I didn't want him to say, 'I made it up.' I wanted {{to tell the story}} and I thought how interesting, if it was all made up, why someone as wealthy and as successful as Chuck Barris would have to do that. I thought that was an interesting person to explore, and that's {{what we wanted to do}} with the film." [...] (Barris had already admitted he had made the story up in a 1984 interview promoting the book; he wrote the story in large part because he had been exiled from television over the controversy surrounding one of his shows, 3's a Crowd. In the same interview, Barris noted that he had applied for work with the CIA in the early 1960s but never actually entered the agency; Confessions of a Dangerous Mind was the product of Barris imagining how he could have done both at the same time.) Clooney acknowledged that his upbringing with father Nick Clooney had a great bearing on his choice of depicting the 1960/70s game shows. [...] "My father had a game show when I was growing up called The Money Maze. I know what those sets look like. I showed the guy how to do cue cards. I grew up on them," [...] the director reflected, [...] "and knew what it looked like and <b>smelled</b> <b>like.</b> And I know something about some of the trappings of fame, so I thought I had a unique take on it." ...|$|E

Cindy said Casey had given varied explanations as to Caylee's whereabouts before finally telling her that she had not seen Caylee for weeks. Casey lied to detectives, telling them Caylee had been kidnapped by a nanny on June9, and that she had been trying to find her, too frightened to alert the authorities. She was charged with first-degree murder in October 2008 and pleaded not guilty.|$|E

2500|$|... when Isaac {{was old and}} {{his sight}} had dimmed, he called Esau {{and asked him to}} hunt some game and prepare a dish, so that Isaac might give him his {{innermost}} blessing before he died. Rebekah had been listening, and when Esau departed, she instructed Jacob to fetch her two choice kids so that she might prepare a dish that Jacob could take to Isaac and receive his blessing. Jacob complained to Rebekah that since Esau was hairy, Isaac might touch him, discover him to be a trickster, and curse him. But Rebekah called the curse upon herself, insisting that Jacob do as she directed. So Jacob got the kids, and Rebekah prepared a dish, had Jacob put on Esau's best clothes, and covered Jacob's hands and neck with the kid's skins. When Jacob went to Isaac, he asked which of his sons had arrived, and Jacob said that he was Esau and asked for Isaac's blessing. Isaac asked him how he had succeeded so quickly, and he said that God had granted him good fortune. Isaac asked Jacob to come closer that Isaac might feel him to determine whether he was really Esau. Isaac felt him and wondered that the voice was Jacob's, but the hands were Esau's. Isaac questioned if it was really Esau, and when Jacob assured him, Isaac asked for the game and Jacob served him the kids and wine. Isaac bade his son to come close and kiss him, and Isaac smelled his clothes, remarking that he <b>smelled</b> <b>like</b> the fields. The fifth reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|E

The trees was all sky-scrapers; the underbrush was full of needles and pins; there was monkeys jumpin' around and crocodiles and pink-tailed mockin'-birds, and ye stood knee-deep in the rotten water and grabbled roots for the liberation of Guatemala. Of nights we would build smudges in camp to discourage the mosquitoes, and sit in the smoke, with the guards pacin' all around us.

A magic hand had transformed {{the interior of}} that rude old prospector's abode. A carpenter and a mason and a decorator had been wonderfully at work. From {{one end to the}} other Columbine gazed; from the big window under which Wilson lay on a blanketed couch to the open fireplace where Wade grinned she looked and looked, and then up to the clean, aspen-poled roof and down to the floor, carpeted with deer hides. The chinks between the logs of the walls were plastered with red clay; the dust and dirt were gone; the place <b>smelled</b> <b>like</b> sage and wood-smoke and fragrant, frying meat. Indeed, there were a glowing bed of embers and a steaming kettle and a smoking pot; and the way the smoke and steam curled up into the gray old chimney attested to its splendid draught. In each corner hung a deer-head, from the antlers of which depended accoutrements of a cowboy--spurs, ropes, belts, scarfs, guns. One corner contained cupboard, ceiling high, with new, clean doors of wood, neatly made; and next to it stood a table, just as new. On the blank wall beyond that were pegs holding saddles, bridles, blankets, clothes.|$|E
