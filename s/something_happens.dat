According to Jacqueline de Romilly, a French philologist {{and member of the}} Académie française, the threat of Philip would give Demosthenes' stances a focus and a raison d'être (reason for existence). Demosthenes saw the king of Macedon as a menace to the autonomy of all Greek cities and yet he presented him as a monster of Athens's own creation; in the First Philippic he reprimanded his fellow citizens as follows: [...] "Even if <b>something</b> <b>happens</b> to him, you will soon raise up a second Philip [...] ".* G.

500|$|The game's battle system, the BliTZ system, {{is carried}} over {{directly}} from Valkyira Chronicles. During missions, players select each unit using a top-down {{perspective of the}} battlefield map: once a character is selected, the player moves the character around the battlefield in third-person. A character can only act once per-turn, but characters can be granted multiple turns {{at the expense of}} other characters' turns. Each character has a field and distance of movement limited by their Action Gauge. Up to nine characters can be assigned to a single mission. During gameplay, characters will call out if <b>something</b> <b>happens</b> to them, such as their health points (HP) getting low or being knocked out by enemy attacks. Each character has specific [...] "Potentials", skills unique to each character. They are divided into [...] "Personal Potential", which are innate skills that remain unaltered unless otherwise dictated by the story and can either help or impede a character, and [...] "Battle Potentials", which are grown throughout the game and always grant boons to a character. To learn Battle Potentials, each character has a unique [...] "Masters Table", a grid-based skill table that can be used to acquire and link different skills. Characters also have Special Abilities that grant them temporary boosts on the battlefield: Kurt can activate [...] "Direct Command" [...] and move around the battlefield without depleting his Action Point gauge, the character Reila can shift into her [...] "Valkyria Form" [...] and become invincible, while Imca can target multiple enemy units with her heavy weapon.|$|E

(Ron); Kimmy Cub (James); K, Miss Perfect, Tin Teeth (Bonnie); Princess, Pumpkin, Cupcake, Miss Snooty, Miss Priss (Shego); and Kimmie by miscellaneous. Unlike traditional superheroes and secret agents, Kim lacks a secret identity; the character is known simply as [...] "Kim Possible, and everyone who knows her knows what she does." [...] Kadeen Griffiths of Bustle observed that Kim [...] "never put on spandex or acquired a secret identity; instead, {{she had her own}} website where people could book her for jobs with a tagline that promised that she could do anything", a claim reinforced by {{the fact that she is}} capable of fighting crime while continuing to perform well in high school and remaining captain of her school's cheerleading squad. Writing for Women Write About Comics, Jamie Kingston observed that Middleton High School [...] "ignores her as a heroine unless <b>something</b> <b>happens</b> on school grounds where she has to do her thing." [...] Thus, Kim rarely receives attention for her work from her family and peers, although her customers remain grateful. However, while describing Kim as a [...] "power fantasy", Stealing Commas believes that Kim is simply [...] "preventing regime change" [...] and [...] "Preserving the status quo rather than doing any real world saving." [...] According to Metacritic, Kim [...] "is stubborn, strong-willed, and has a fuse shorter than a grenade with a three second delay" [...] but remains [...] "extremely humble, refusing to take credit for her truly amazing actions." [...] Meanwhile, David Horiuchi of Amazon.com wrote that the character is [...] "tough, witty, and refreshingly free of any saucy teen attitude." ...|$|E
500|$|Cisneros often {{incorporates}} Spanish {{into her}} English writing, substituting Spanish words for English ones where {{she feels that}} Spanish better conveys the meaning or improves {{the rhythm of the}} passage. However, where possible she constructs sentences so that non-Spanish speakers can infer the meaning of Spanish words from their context. In Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories Cisneros writes: [...] "La Gritona. Such a funny name for such a lovely arroyo. But that's what they called the creek that ran behind the house." [...] Even if the English-speaking reader does not initially know that arroyo means creek, Cisneros soon translates {{it in a way that}} does not interrupt the flow of the text. She enjoys manipulating the two languages, creating new expressions in English by literally translating Spanish phrases. In the same book Cisneros writes: [...] "And at the next full moon, I gave light, Tía Chucha holding up our handsome, strong-lunged boy." [...] Previous sentences inform the reader that a baby is being born, but only a Spanish speaker will notice that [...] "I gave light" [...] is a literal translation of the Spanish [...] "dí a luz" [...] which means [...] "I gave birth." [...] Cisneros joins other Hispanic-American US writers such as Gloria Anzaldúa, Piri Thomas, Giannina Braschi, Gustavo Pérez Firmat, and Junot Díaz, who create playful linguistic hybrids of Spanish and English. Cisneros noted on this process: [...] "All of a sudden <b>something</b> <b>happens</b> to the English, something really new is happening, a new spice is added to the English language." [...] Spanish always has a role in Cisneros's work, even when she writes in English. As she discovered, after writing The House on Mango Street primarily in English, [...] "the syntax, the sensibility, the diminutives, the way of looking at inanimate objects" [...] were all characteristic of Spanish. For Cisneros, Spanish brings to her work not only colorful expressions, but also a distinctive rhythm and attitude.|$|E

500|$|The {{season is}} {{structured}} into three [...] "pods" [...] {{based on its}} airing schedule: the first eight episodes, subtitled Ghost Rider; LMD (Life Model Decoy) for the subsequent seven episodes; and a third pod for the final seven episodes called Agents of Hydra. Elements and characters cross over between the different pods, but the sections [...] "definitely have a different feel" [...] from one another, as Tancharoen explained that 22 episodes [...] "is {{a long time to}} hold a big bad or a single plot line, especially for an audience", and for the past two seasons, the series was able to have two separated halves that [...] "allows us to introduce a big bad. And then, <b>something</b> <b>happens</b> and we rise somebody new ... Now, there's three of those." [...] "Financial considerations" [...] were also taken into account in creating the pods for the season, as using LMDs does not [...] "cost as much as setting a guy's head on fire via CGI". In terms of writing the [...] "complicated season", Whedon said the writers were [...] "aware that our fans are our fans and have spent some time with these characters and are clever and see things coming sometimes ... Part of our job is to create not just what we are presenting on plot, but letting the audience be one step ahead of us and being one step ahead of that." [...] He added that the writers knew that they wanted to tell a Ghost Rider story, an LMD story, and a [...] "what if" [...] scenario, and the hardest part was making each pod still fit together as a single season. The major connection ultimately became the Darkhold, which leads from the magic of Ghost Rider to the advanced science of LMD and then the Framework in Agents of Hydra. Ghost Rider also reappears in the final episode of the season, [...] "World's End", as an additional connection.|$|E
