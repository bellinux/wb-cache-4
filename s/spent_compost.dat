The experimental design was in a completely randomized factorial scheme with four treatments (two strains of A. blazei x two types of compost) and 30 repetitions. Each experimental unit consisted of a box with 10 to 10. 5 kg of moist fresh compost. According to the results obtained, the loss of organic matter of the composts was affected by the A. blazei strain {{and the type of}} compost used. The traditional compost lost a higher organic matter content compared to the <b>spent</b> <b>compost,</b> and the ABL 99 / 30 strain caused a higher loss of organic matter in the composts compared to the ABL 04 / 49 strain.

The percentage of decolourisation for tryphan blue, amido black, remazol brilliant blue R (RBBR) and bromophenol blue ranged between 80 - 90 % after 4 h reaction. However, the percentage of decolourisation for crystal violet, methyl green and congo red was lower than the other dyes from the same dye group with only 60 - 65 % after 12 h. Methylene blue exhibited the least decolourisation with only 43 % after 24 h indicating that this dye is a poor substrate for the enzyme. The rate of decolourisation for crystal violet, tryphan blue, amido black, congo red and RBBR dyes by enzymes from spent mushroom compost (SMC) were also calculated. The rate of decolourisation for all the dyes was positively affected by the initial dye concentration, pH between 4. 0 - 4. 5 and temperature range of 30 - 35 C. The optimum concentration of veratryl alcohol as redox mediator was between 0 - 2 mM for all the dyes except for RBBR. The optimum veratryl alcohol concentration for RBBR was 4 mM.

40|$|Introduction:Elimination or {{reduction}} of petroleum hydrocarbons from natural {{resources such as}} water and soil {{is a serious problem}} of countries, particularly oil-rich countries of the world. Using white rotting fungi compost for bioremediation of soils contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons is effective. The aim of this study is molecular identification and potential of anisolate of white rot fungi in bioremediation of petroleum contaminated soils. Materials and methods: <b>Spent</b> <b>compost</b> of white rotting fungi was inoculated with petroleum contaminated soil into 3 %, 5 % and 10 % (w/w). Treatments were incubated at 25 - 23 °C for 3 months. Reduction of petroleum hydrocarbons in treated soil was determined by gas chromatography. Ecotoxicity of soil was evaluated by seed germination test. Results: Based on the genome sequence of 18 s rRNA, it is revealed that this isolate is Ganoderma lucidum and this isolate is deposited as accession KX 525204 in the Gene Bank database. Reduction of petroleum hydrocarbons in soil treated with compost (3, 5 and 10 %) ranged from 42 % to 71 %. The germination index (%) in ecotoxicity tests ranged from 20. 8 % to 70. 8 %. Gas chromatography results also showed a decrease in soil Hydrocarbons compounds. Discussion and conclusion: The compost of Ganoderma lucidum, a white rot fungus, has a potential ability to remove petroleum hydrocarbons in contaminated soil. Removal of hydrocarbons was increased with increase in compost mixed with contaminated soil.

Therefore, investigation of agronomic practices specially nutrient management in the field is important because of its effective role in the promotion of plant growth, yield and consequently seeds with good quality criteria. Materials and methods In order to investigate seed quantitative and qualitative criteria of black cumin (Nigella sativa L.), isabgol (Plantago ovate Forsk.) and fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.) under application of organic fertilizers including cow manure, <b>spent</b> mushroom <b>compost,</b> municipal waste compost and control, an experiment was conducted in a complete randomized block design with three replications at Agricultural Research Station of Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, during two growing season of 2010 - 2011 and 2011 - 2012. Consequently, their seed quality criteria were evaluated in a factorial experiment based on completely randomized design with three replications in Laboratory of Seed Technology at College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of Tehran. Criteria such as biological and seed yield, harvest index, 1000 - seed weight, length, width and diameter of seed, seed germination percentage and rate, seed vigour index, length and weight of seedling were investigated. Results and discussion Results indicated that organic fertilizers caused a significant increase in seed yield and biological yield in which <b>spent</b> mushroom <b>compost</b> had the highest effect on mentioned criteria compared to control in both years of experiment.

40|$|Agaricus bisporus, {{the white}} button mushroom, is {{economically}} {{the most important}} mushroom cultivated worldwide. Growth of A. bisporus needs a substrate produced by the composting of animal manure, wheat straw, gypsum, water and different additives. Therefore lignocellulose which is a complex mixture of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin usually constitutes an important {{fraction of the total}} organic matter. Degradation of plant biomass is an important aspect of the cultivation process of edible mushrooms, but the mechanisms behind it are still largely a black box. The commercial cultivation of A. bisporus offers a unique opportunity to study the interaction of a fungus with its substrate. In addition, each ton of produced mushrooms leaves almost the same amount of <b>spent</b> <b>compost</b> which contains approximately one third of carbohydrates from the original compost. Therefore the aim of this PhD thesis was to obtain a deeper understanding of how A. bisporus grows in compost and degrades its substrate, and to study the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. Multi-omics studies together with substrate composition analysis and measurements of enzymatic activities were performed to understand the unique mechanisms of lignocellulose degradation and conversion by A. bisporus. The genome sequence of A. bisporus identified a wide set of genes encoding plant cell wall Carbohydrate Active enZymes (CAZymes) and detailed analysis of the expression of these genes together with genes involved in central carbon metabolism was performed in compost, casing layer and fruiting bodies of the first flush. To further evaluate degradation of the substrate by A. bisporus in-depth integrative analysis of transcript expression and protein secretion as well as carbohydrate degrading enzyme assays data from A. bisporus mycelium grown compost at different growth stages was performed. To make transcriptome analysis possible, the method based on the CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation was developed and allowed obtaining high levels of quality and quantity of RNA. Overall, the analysis of the genome and transcriptome of A. bisporus revealedthe unique repertoire of genes and its expression pattern showed the adaptation of this fungus to humic rich partially decomposed leaf material. Detailed analysis of the genes encoding plant and fungal polysaccharide modifying enzymes and central carbon metabolism demonstrated differences in these genes expression between compost- casing layer-grown mycelium and fruiting bodies. Further investigations of transcriptome and proteome for abilities of A. bisporus to degrade plant biomass throughout its life cycle showed changes in gene expression involved in (hemi-) cellulose degradation {{between the first and second}} flushes could partially explain the reduction in the yield of mushrooms during the second flush. Moreover, exploring unutilized fractions which remain in compost, arabinosyl and glucuronic acid substituents of the xylan backbone were found to be accumulated in the compost towards the end of the mushroom cultivation. These observations may explain the plant biomass degrading abilities of A. bisporus, revealing a set of potential important genes as well as secreted enzymes, including those which are missing and potentially significant for the substrate degradation...|$|E

40|$|An {{industrial}} soil {{collected from}} a recycling factory was contaminated by DEHP and spilled diesel. The soils {{were divided into}} two batches for off-site ex situ bioremediation by SMC. This industrial soil was contaminated with 5. 4 - 6. 9 g/kg total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), 14. 5 [...] 19. 0 g/kg oil and grease and 95 - 99 mg/kg DEHP. The removal by 3 % SMC amendment applied twice accounted for 56 - 64 %, 31 [...] 33 % and 51 [...] 54 % disappearance of the TPH, oil and grease and DEHP contaminants, respectively. Beside chemical analysis, six bacteria and six fungi were inoculated into the sterilized soil samples for ecotoxicity tests. The original soil samples containing residual oil and DEHP contents were found to be more toxic than the SMC-treated soil. Thus SMC simultaneously degrades organic pollutants and reduces toxicity in less than a month. An underground water sample contaminated with dibutyl phthalate (DBP, 127. 5 +/- 20. 7 mu 1 / 1) and DEHP (67. 0 +/- 7. 7 mu 1 / 1) was tested. One percent SMC could remove 94. 2 +/- 3. 6 % and 100 % for DBP and DEHP, respectively, within 1 h at room temperature. DBP and DEHP were degraded completely by SMCE except 0. 2 % SMCE for DBP after 24 -h treatment. SMC had higher removal efficiencies than SMCE, because SMC had an integrated system of biosorption and biodegradation to remove DBP and DEHP. The sorption kinetics of DBP and DEHP by SMC could be described by the Freundlich monolayer model. Even after eight cycles of the sorption-desorption of DEHP SMC maintained the 100 % removal efficiency. Thus SMC is a good biosorbent for DEHP. Besides, DEHP-contaminated sediment was collected from Kai Tak Approach Channel, Kowloon. This sediment contained 44. 4 - 128. 0 mg/kg DEHP and heavy metals 21. 3 - 23. 4 mg/kg Cd, 24. 9 - 43. 5 mg/kg Ni, 128. 5 - 198. 5 mg/kg Pb, 144. 6 - 329. 2 mg/kg Zn and 164. 5 - 230. 0 mg/kg Cu, and bore an unpleasant sewer smell. SMC and SMCE as strong oxidizing agents could decrease the S content of sediment significantly as well as calcium nitrate, and consequently lowered the evolution of nuisance gas hydrogen sulfide. With the treatment of the optimized combination of 2. 25 % SMCE and 0. 25 % nitrate, the malodor could be removed completely and the contents of H 2 S and NH 3 in the air were decreased significantly. For the degradation of organic pollutants, the target pollutant DEHP showed a sharp decrease in the first week in the time effect experiment after the treatment with the combination of 2. 25 % SMCE and 0. 25 % nitrate, while the decrease of DEHP slowed down in the second week. The results may be attributed to the immediate degradation of DEHP by enzymes in SMCE. When raw sediment and nitrate-treated sediment were bioremediated with SMCE, larger fluctuation in DEHP removal was observed with the nitrate-treated sediment. It supports that nitrate and SMCE would act in optimum at a certain combination. The effect on mobilization of sediment heavy metals by SMC or SMCE was also examined. Although some laboratory results suggested reduction of copper and lead, other results using different environmental samples of the sediment did not reproduce the results. Further investigation is needed. Plasticizers are additives used in the manufacture of plastics, and high residual plasticizer levels are encountered in the environment. Bis(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), being the most common plasticizer, is a suspected human carcinogen and an endocrine disruptor. Therefore, DEHP-contaminated soil, sediment and water samples were collected, and the bioremediation capacities of the <b>spent</b> <b>compost</b> of mushroom Pleurotus pulmonarius (SMC) were determined. This study reveals the potential in applying SMC of P. pulmonarius in bioremediation of DEHP from the soil, sediment and water environments. More investigation and field studies would be appropriate for developing spent P. pulmonarius compost in environmental cleanup. Using artificially spiked garden soil with DEHP and ultra-low sulphur diesel, the removal efficiencies of SMC were 41. 7 +/- 9. 8 % and 36. 1 +/- 8. 4 % for TP 11 and DEHP, respectively. SMCE which contained the water-soluble nutrients, SMC enzymes and micro-organisms had about half removal efficiency of SMC on the same pollutant. The enriched SMC microorganisms also showed biodegradation of DEHP and diesel, so did the filtrate containing enzymes and nutrients of SMC. Thus SMC acted in multiple ways in bioremediation of DEHP: biostimulation and bioaugmentation. Besides, the immobilized lignolytic enzymes of the mushroom P. pulmonarius {{played a major role in}} biodegradation. Gao, Ting. "October 2009. "Adviser: S. W. Chiu.

Different concentration of Pleurotus <b>spent</b> mushroom <b>compost</b> in powder (SMC) and activated carbon (SMCAC) were added into Murashige and Skoog media (MS) with 0. 1 mg/L 6 -benzylaminopurine (BAP). The shoot regeneration of Clinacantus nutans plant such as number of shoots, number of leaves and length of leaves were recorded for four weeks. Collected data was analyzed using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey test through the SPSS Statistics 21 software. The 0. 1 g/L SMC recorded the highest leaves numbers. Meanwhile, 0. 2 g/L SMC showed highest performance in length of shoot. The SMCAC showed a negative response in number of leaves and shoot as well as length of shoot. In summary, the SMC showed significant performance in number of leave and shoot length but less effective on number of shoot. In contradictory, the SMCAC reported poor performance in shoot regeneration but contribute in absorption of nutrient from environment and storage of the nutrient asfunction of biochar. Therefore, the SMC has a high potential as a green supplementary nutrient for tissue culture.

Several Pleurotus spp. {{have been}} {{documented}} to release allelopathic compounds against nematodes in laboratory trials. Introduction of this fungus to a crop production field for nematode management are challenged by various environmental factors. Two approaches were proposed to introduce <b>spent</b> oyster mushroom <b>compost</b> waste to a basil (Ocimum basilicum) agroecosystem: 1) amending transplant media mix with <b>spent</b> mushroom <b>compost</b> substrate, and or 2) delivering the mycotoxin through drenching plant roots with mushroom compost water extract (MCWE). Specific objectives of this thesis include 1) determining amendment rates of Pleurotus sp. compost into potting media to suppress root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne incognita), 2) determine concentrations of mushroom compost water extract for nematode suppression, and 3) evaluate a <b>spent</b> oyster mushroom <b>compost</b> based technology for pre- and post-plant nematode management in field trials. A greenhouse pot trial demonstrated that amending <b>spent</b> Pleurotus ostreatus <b>compost</b> with coffee grounds as the substrate, did not suppress population densities of Meloidogyne incognita on basil planted in a sand: soil mix. Four laboratory trials were conducted using <b>spent</b> oyster mushroom <b>compost</b> amended into media with high organic matters in Cone-tainers: yard waste compost was used in Conetainer I, II, and III. And peat: moss: perlite was used in Cone-tainer IV. Numbers of M. incognita were suppressed at mushroom compost amendment rate ≥ 1 % in a yard waste compost media. When amended into peat moss potting mix, mushroom compost amendment also suppressed M. incognita penetration at 1 and 33 %. When preparing mushroom compost into MCWE, a minimum of 1 % concentration is needed to suppress mobility of M. incognita if incubated for ≥ 2 days. However, the nematode suppressive effect of MCWE was nematostatic instead of nematicidal. When M. incognita J 2 s were incubated for 7 days in MCWE Trial II, MCWE suppressed 22 and 41 % of viability of M. incognita at as low as 10 and 25 % concentration, respectively. Application of oyster mushroom compost was then evaluated in two field trials at Poamoho (Trial I) and Magoon (Trial II), respectively. Although mushroom compost amendment did not suppress plant-parasitic nematodes in both trials, its effects on soil health varied by trial. In Trial I, mushroom compost (amendment or drenching) plots were dominated by bacterial decomposition (lower CI, P < 0. 01) initially, and resulted in a reduced soil food web structure (lower SI, P < 0. 05). Lack of enhancement of fungivorous nematodes in this trial indicated a poor mushroom mycelia establishment in this field. However, in Trial II, mushroom compost amendment enhanced fungal decomposition as indicated by higher abundance of fungivorous nematodes than no mushroom compost treatments (P < 0. 05) throughout the basil crop. The enhancement of fungivorous nematodes throughout Trial II coincided with enhancement of soil health conditions as indicated {{by an increase in}} abundance of bacterivorous (P < 0. 05) and omnivorous (P < 0. 01) nematodes compared to no mushroom treatments. When used as a seedling potting mix amendment, nematode richness in amendment plots was also increased (P < 0. 05) compared to no amendment. However, <b>spent</b> oyster mushroom <b>compost</b> did not improve basil yield due to heavy infestation of Peronospora belbahrii, but amendment improved height in Poamoho. <b>Spent</b> oyster mushroom <b>compost</b> as amendment and sometimes as drench increased bacterivorous and fungivorous nematodes, and if practiced in area with higher humidity, it could also potentially increase omnivorous and predatory nematodes. In conclusion, although mushroom compost amendment and drench did not suppress plant-parasitic nematodes, they had varying effects in improving soil health. <b>Spent</b> oyster mushroom <b>compost</b> as amendment and sometimes as drench increased bacterivorous and fungivorous nematodes, and if practiced in area with higher humidity, it could also potentially increase omnivorous and predatory nematodes. Overall, the benefits of oyster mushroom compost for suppression of plant-parasitic nematodes and improving soil health might take time. Continual practice of introducing mushroom compost waste in an agroecosystem might be needed to observe the benefits of this saprophytic fungus. Future research is needed to evaluate more frequent MCWE drenching for the management of plant-parasitic nematodes...|$|R

Previous studies have reported the feasibility of brandling worms, Eisenia foetida, for vermicomposting SS, whereas we conducted vermicomposting by employing red worms, Lumbricus rubellus, with a combination of different percentages of SS and <b>spent</b> mushroom <b>compost</b> (SMC) for 70 days subsequent to 21 days of precomposting. The vermicompost produced in treatments with a low percentage of SS were fine in texture, dark in colour and odourless in contrast to the initial physical characteristics. Results indicate that growth in earthworm numbers and biomass gain was maximum at 25 : 75 (T D) of SS : SMC compared to other treatments with 5 and 8 - fold increases, respectively. The heavy metals contained in vermicompost were 0. 25 â�¼ 11. 57 -fold higher than the initial concentration due to mineralization and excretion of non-accumulated heavy metals existent in the earthworms' gut, which were present prior to treatments. Even so, the concentration was below the limits set by EU and US biosolid compost standards and safe to be utilized as a biofertilizer and soil conditioner.

All composts and CM were used in three different levels (low, medium, and high) based on the local use of these materials by farmers. Furthermore, we applied two different methods of compost placement to study the potentials of soil conditioners in broadcast and row placement. An effective soil conditioner placement improves nutrient availability for plants and increases their competitiveness against weeds (Nkebiwe et al. 2016).|$|R

This study aimed to {{examine the effect of}} three compost types (vegetable, fruit and yard waste compost, garden waste <b>compost,</b> and <b>spent</b> mushroom <b>compost)</b> on basic properties of a loamy sand and greenhouse tomato productivity. Disturbed and intact soil samples were taken from a decade-long compost field experiment on loamy sand with three compost types at application rate of 30 m 3 ha- 1 yr- 1. The soils were characterized for chemical and physical properties. Tomato was planted in a greenhouse using soil samples from the field and vegetative and yield parameters (plant height, stem diameter, leaf number, and fruit yield), water productivity, and harvest index were evaluated. All compost types significantly increased soil total carbon, total nitrogen, pH, electrical conductivity and significantly decreased bulk density, with no effect on plant available water. Fresh and dry fruit weights were significantly increased after compost addition. Plant height, leaf number, stem diameter, and total biomass did not significantly improve after compost addition. Slight increases in water productivity and harvest index were also observed. <b>Spent</b> mushroom <b>compost</b> showed greater promise in improving tomato productivity. A decade-long application of composts on loamy sand improved basic chemical and physical properties which was reflected in increased fruit yield in tomato. Since no negative effect of compost was observed, we suggest that sandy soils may serve as a safe disposal option for these composts and potentially support crop growth...|$|R

40|$|Claessens, LucThe world’s {{greatest}} {{concentration of}} mushroom farms is settled within the Brandywine-Christina River Basin in Chester County in southeastern Pennsylvania. This industry produces a nutrient-rich byproduct known as <b>spent</b> mushroom <b>compost,</b> {{which has been}} traditionally applied to local farm fields as an organic fertilizer and soil amendment. While mushroom compost has beneficial properties, the possible over-application to farm fields could potentially degrade stream water quality. The goal {{of this study was}} to estimate the spatial extent and intensity of field-applied mushroom compost. We applied a remote sensing approach using Landsat multispectral imagery. We utilized the soil line technique, using the red and near-infrared bands, to estimate differences in soil wetness as a result of increased soil organic matter content from mushroom compost. We validated soil wetness estimates by examining the spectral response of references sites. We performed a second independent validation analysis using expert knowledge from agricultural extension agents. Our results showed that the soil line based wetness index worked well. The spectral validation illustrated that compost changes the spectral response of soil because of changes in wetness. The independent expert validation analysis produced a strong significant correlation between our remotely-sensed wetness estimates and the empirical ratings of compost application intensities. Overall, the methodology produced realistic spatial distributions of field-applied compost application intensities across the study area. These spatial distributions will be used for follow-up studies to assess the effect of <b>spent</b> mushroom <b>compost</b> on stream water quality. M. S.

40|$|In {{order to}} study the effect of {{different}} types and rates of animal manure and <b>spent</b> mushroom <b>compost</b> on controlling Egyptian broomrape (Orobanche aegyptiaca Perss.) in tomato (Mill. Lycopersicon esculentum), two studies were conducted on randomized complete block design with three replications at Research green house, College of Agriculture, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad and Nemooneh field of Astane Ghods Razavi during two years of 2009 and 2010. Greenhouse study treatments were consist of poultry, cow, sheep manure and <b>spent</b> mushroom <b>compost,</b> which each one applied at four rates (10, 20, 30 and 40 t. ha- 1). Field experiment treatments were included of poultry, cow and sheep manure that each one applied at two rates (20 and 40 t. ha- 1). Result of the greenhouse study indicated that poultry manure significantly reduced orobanch infestation and increase tomato dry weight compared to control. But in the field experiment, the maximum fruit yield (68 t. ha- 1) with the minimum orobanch dry weight were obtained with sheep manure. The effect of cow manure was similar to poultry manure in all measured traits. In the field study, rates of manure application had no significant effect on orobanch fresh and dry weights. The findings indicated that all treatments of animal manure reduced orobanch infestation. But the mechanism of orobanch growth suppression due to animal manures application is unknown. It seems fermentation of different organic matters can produced heat and the resulting toxic compounds such as certain organic acids, ammonia and ammonium salts that may reduce orobanch growth at proper concentrations...|$|R

40|$|Treatment of {{agricultural}} biodegradable wastes and by-products {{can be carried}} out using composting or vermicomposting, or a combination of both treatment methods, to create a growing medium amendment suitable for horticultural use. When compared to traditional compost-maturation, vermicompost-maturation resulted in a more mature growing medium amendment i. e. lower C/N and pH, with increased nutrient content and improved plant growth response, increasing lettuce shoot fresh and dry weight by an average of 15 % and 14 %, respectively. Vermicomposted horse manure compost was used as a growing medium amendment for lettuce and was found to significantly increase lettuce shoot and root growth, and chlorophyll content. When used as a growing medium amendment for tomato fruit production, vermicomposted <b>spent</b> mushroom <b>compost</b> increased shoot growth and marketable yield, and reduced blossom end rot in two independent studies. Vermicompost addition to peat-based growing media increased marketable yield by an average of 21 %. Vermicompost also improved tomato fruit quality parameters such as acidity and sweetness. Fruit sweetness, as measured using Brix value, was significantly increased in fruits grown with 10 % or 20 % vermicompost addition by 0. 2 in truss one and 0. 3 in truss two. Fruit acidity (% citric acid) was significantly increased in plants grown with vermicompost by an average of 0. 65 % in truss one and 0. 68 % in truss two. These changes in fruit chemical parameters resulted in a higher tomato fruit overall acceptability rating as determined by a consumer acceptance panel. When incorporated into soil, vermicomposted <b>spent</b> mushroom <b>compost</b> increased plant growth and reduced plant stress under conditions of cold stress, but not salinity or heat stress. The addition of 20 % vermicompost to cold-stressed plants increased plant growth by an average of 30 % and increased chlorophyll fluorescence by an average of 21 %. Compared to peat-based growing medium, vermicompost had consistently higher nutrient content, pH, electrical conductivity and bulk density, and when added to a peat-based growing medium, vermicomposted <b>spent</b> mushroom <b>compost</b> altered the microbial community. Vermicompost amendment increased the microbial activity of the growing medium when incorporated initially, and this increased microbial activity was observed for up to four months after incorporation when plants were grown in it.

40|$|Several {{in vitro}} and in vivo {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} develop an effective technique for culturing potential fungal antagonists (isolates of Trichoderma harzianum, Dactylium dendroides, Chaetomium olivaceum and one unidentified fungus) selected for activity against Armillaria mellea. The antagonists were inoculated onto (1) live spawn of the oyster mu shroom (Pleurotus ostreatus), (2) extra-moistened or sucrose-enriched mushroom composts containing living or autoclaved mycelia of P. ostreatus or Agaricus bisporus (button mushroom), (3) pasteurized compost with or without A. bisporus mycelium, wheat bran, wheat germ and (4) <b>spent</b> mushroom <b>composts</b> with living mycelia of A. bisporus, P. ostreatus or Lentinus edodes (the Shiitake mushroom). In one experiment, a representative antagonist (isolate Th 2 of T. harzianum) was grown together with the A. bisporus mycelium, while in another one, the antagonist was first grown on wheat germ or wheat bran and then on mushroom compost with living mycelium of A. bisporus. Some of the carrier substrates were then added {{to the roots of}} potted strawberry plants in the glasshouse to evaluate their effectiveness against the disease. The antagonists failed to grow on the spawn of P. ostreatus even after reinoculations and prolonged incubation. Providing extra moisture or sucrose enrichment also did not improve the growth of Th 2 on mushroom composts in the presence of living mycelia of A. bisporus or P. ostreatus. The antagonist, however, grew rapidly and extensively on mushroom compost with autoclaved mycelia, and also on wheat germ and wheat bran. Colonization of the substrates by the antagonist was positively correlated with its effectiveness in the glasshouse studies. Whereas only 33. 3 % of the inoculated control plants survived in one experiment monitored for 560 days, 100 % survival was achieved when Th 2 was applied on wheat germ or wheat bran. Growth of the antagonist alone on pasteurized or sterilized compost (without A. bisporus mycelia) and simultaneous growth of the antagonist and mushroom on pasteurized compost did not improve survival over the inoculated controls, but growth over mushroom compost with the living mycelium resulted in 50 % survival rate. C. olivaceum isolate Co was the most effective, resulting in overall survival rate of 83. 3 % compared with only 8. 3 % for the inoculated and 100 % for the uninoculated (healthy) controls.
