[...] "Agricultural exceptionalism," [...] i.e., the use of legal exceptions to protect the agricultural industry, is pervasive, worldwide. [...] American law schools and legal scholars first recognized <b>agricultural</b> <b>law</b> as a discipline in the 1940s when law schools at Yale, Harvard, Texas, and Iowa explored and initiated <b>agricultural</b> <b>law</b> courses. These early efforts were short-lived, however, and <b>agricultural</b> <b>law</b> as a distinct discipline did not resurface for three decades. In 1979, a scholarly journal, The <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Law</b> Journal was initiated. In 1980, the American <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Law</b> Association was formed and an advanced law degree program, the LL.M. Program in <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Law</b> was founded at the University of Arkansas School of Law. In 1981, a fifteen volume <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Law</b> Treatise was published and in 1985, the first <b>law</b> school casebook, <b>Agricultural</b> Law: Cases and Materials was published by West Publishing.|$|R
40|$|Objective: In {{this study}} {{the state of}} {{inclusion}} within North Carolina <b>Secondary</b> <b>Agricultural</b> Education programming was examined. Background: In 2012 The North Carolina State Board of Education established a vision of assuring a strong, flexible, and sound educational system that serves all students and additionally promotes the public interest. This vision includes its <b>secondary</b> <b>agricultural</b> education programs as well. Methodology: The research design for this study consisted of a descriptive survey research design, encompassing {{a random sample of}} 196 North Carolina <b>Secondary</b> <b>Agricultural</b> Educators. The final return rate yielded a usable sample of 90 respondents (45 % return rate). Findings: North Carolina <b>Secondary</b> <b>Agricultural</b> Educators indicated that agricultural education was beneficial to women and minority populations. Various barriers to inclusion were noted. Uncertainty in working with various dimensions of inclusion were found. Solutions to improving inclusion were identified. Conclusion:Overall, it was found that inclusion was critical for <b>secondary</b> <b>agricultural</b> education in North Carolina. Application: Findings from this study will aid North Carolina <b>Secondary</b> <b>Agricultural</b> Educators and officials in developing more inclusive learning environments...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{determine}} the existing trends in the development of <b>agricultural</b> <b>law</b> as a branch of legislation. These trends shed light on the problems connected with the development of this branch of the law and scholarly discipline. The presented considerations are founded upon the assumption that observing the changes can help define certain regularities or tendencies in <b>agricultural</b> <b>law</b> development. Legislation development is undoubtedly connected with the development o f both the doctrine and <b>agricultural</b> <b>law</b> as a branch o f the legal system. In order to characterize the evolution from the traditional <b>agricultural</b> <b>law</b> towards the modern, or modernized <b>agricultural</b> <b>law,</b> and at the same time to pinpoint the existing developmental trends o f this branch o f the law, one should above all focus upon such phenomena as: a) gradual „piling up” of <b>agricultural</b> legislation (<b>agricultural</b> <b>law</b> dynamics); b) expansion of the regulated area, i. e. the agricultural law; c) changes of the legal influence methods (i. e. methods of publicizing agricultural law); d) Creation and evolution o f legal institutions within this branch of the law. The starting point and the axis of the considerations is the general assumption that the usual course of evolution is from traditional to modem <b>agricultural</b> <b>law.</b> While the former is usually associated with the past and is well-known and scientifically studied, the latter is connected with the present time and some further studies on this law are required...|$|R
40|$|Countless {{research}} suggests that <b>secondary</b> <b>agricultural</b> education programs could benefit all students regardless of school characteristics and geographic location, yet many secondary schools have yet to include agricultural education {{as part of their}} curricular offerings. In response, numerous studies have been conducted in recent years throughout the United States regarding how <b>secondary</b> <b>agricultural</b> education programs are perceived by school leaders. For the first time, this study sought to shed light on how secondary principals in Kentucky perceived agricultural education programs. Considered in this study, were how <b>secondary</b> principals with <b>agricultural</b> education in their schools perceived those programs differently than <b>secondary</b> principals without <b>agricultural</b> education in their schools. Secondary principals in Kentucky were selected to participate in this study based on the population of Kentucky counties that had at least one <b>secondary</b> school with <b>agricultural</b> education and at least one <b>secondary</b> school without <b>agricultural</b> education (N = 95). This quantitative descriptive study measured how participants perceived <b>secondary</b> <b>agricultural</b> education programs by utilizing a survey with Likert-type and demographic questions. Four constructs guided the survey items to measure how <b>secondary</b> principals perceived <b>agricultural</b> education based upon overall program success, the courses offered in agricultural education programs, the quality of agriculture teachers, and personal familiarity with the FFA. Results indicated that <b>secondary</b> principals with <b>agricultural</b> education in their schools have significantly higher perceptions of such programs than do <b>secondary</b> principals without <b>agricultural</b> education in their schools. Furthermore, results revealed that all constructs included in this study have predictive variables of one’s overall perception of <b>secondary</b> <b>agricultural</b> education programs.

North Carolina <b>secondary</b> <b>agricultural</b> teachers reported that the barriers to diversity inclusion included prejudicial issues, the perception of agriculture itself, stereotypes, and guidance counselors. Study participants indicated that having agricultural education stakeholders focus upon varying student learning styles, examining educational materials for diversity content, multicultural education, infusing diversity competencies in agricultural teacher education programs, and mentoring were strategies agreed upon for increasing diversity inclusion in agricultural education. Final recommendations for increasing diversity inclusion included utilizing diversified curriculum materials, establishing collaborative relationships with school officials such as guidance counselors, and preservice and inservice multicultural training...|$|R
