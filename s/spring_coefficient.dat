The stress {{distribution}} of an S-shaped micro spring fabricated by the micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) technology was analyzed by the finite-element method (FEM) using ANSYS software, {{which showed that}} the stress concentration {{is located in the}} inner corner of the turning round.

40|$|In design stage, the {{conventional}} steel buildings are commonly using {{the methods of}} pinned design {{which means that the}} behavior of the connection is fully on the basis of pin and rigid design which means that the behavior of the connection is completely rigid. In contrast, the real behavior of joints are not fully rigid or fully pinned, therefore the discrepancy between these manners is called semi-rigid connection. Therefore, this study is lead to evaluate the semi-rigid connected frame under the dynamic loading by applying damper. The numerical method on the basis of stiffness matrix method, which is developed using in Matlab Program, is used to assess this condition that can be divided in the main five steps. Firstly, mass and stiffness matrixes of semi-rigid connection frame are obtained. Secondly, formulation of damping matrix is developed. Thirdly, solving the dynamic equation by central method. Fourthly, the changes of <b>spring</b> <b>coefficient,</b> natural frequency, damper frequency and damper ratio are considered. Finally, numerical method is verified by SAP 2000 modeling. In conclusion, by increasing the spring stiffness coefficient the lateral rigidity of frame increases. In the case of the constant section area of frame member, as the <b>spring</b> <b>coefficient</b> of semi-rigid increases while it reaches to rigid connection, the text increment of <b>spring</b> <b>coefficient</b> cannot improve rigidity of the frame. It means that there is no absolute rigid connection, and vice versa it is true for pinned connection.

40|$|We {{theoretically}} propose {{and investigate}} a feasible experimental scheme for {{the realization of}} the dynamical Casimir effect (DCE) in a hybrid optomechanical cavity with a moving end mirror containing an interacting cigar-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). We show that in the red-detuned regime of cavity optomechanics together with the weak optomechanical coupling limit by coherent modulation of the s-wave scattering frequency of the BEC and the mechanical <b>spring</b> <b>coefficient</b> of the mechanical oscillator (MO), the mechanical and atomic quantum vacuum fluctuations are parametrically amplified, which consequently lead to the generation of the mechanical/Bogoliubov-type Casimir phonons. Interestingly, in the coherent regime corresponding to the case of largely different optomechanical coupling strengths of the cavity field to the BEC and the MO, or equivalently largely different cooperativities, one can generate a large number of Casimir photons due to the amplification of the intracavity vacuum fluctuations induced by the time modulations of the BEC and the MO. The number of generated Casimir particles are externally controllable by the cooperativities, and the modulation amplitudes of the atomic collisions rate and the mechanical <b>spring</b> <b>coefficient.</b> Comment: 12 pages, 6 figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} {{had been}} conducted for shipside collision against unstiffened, inclined jacket leg segment (column). The inclined column has been modelled with horizontal-to-vertical ratio of 1 / 7. Two types of boundary {{conditions of the}} column has been modelled; perfectly clamped boundary conditions (clamped or fixed) and boundary conditions with axial flexibility (axial spring). For clamped column, two different impact locations have been simulated, namely middle span impact and quarter span impact. For each impact location, three (3) design categories have been analysed; ductile design (Rigid Ship versus deformable column), integrated design (deformable ship versus deformable column), and strength design (Rigid column versus deformable ship). For rigid ship and integrated cases, three (3) column wall thicknesses had been simulated to present the transition from ductile to integrated and strength categories. From the force-displacement relationships, the force demanded to generate the same displacement both on the column and shipside is slightly higher for middle span impact than for quarter span impact, for all column wall thickness assessed herein. However, the resistance to indentation appeared to be significantly higher for middle span impact after the contact area had developed until over {{the height of the}} shipside. Considering the analysis results from fixed columns, the column with the wall thickness of 40 mm under middle span impact had been chosen as main representative model to reveal the influence of the axial flexibility to the capacity of the column. Two (2) types of the spring arrangement on each column-end have been modelled, namely the multiple springs and the single springs. For multiple springs type, two different <b>spring</b> <b>coefficients</b> have been evaluated, namely the equivalent and the unequal (nodal) spring stiffness. The <b>spring</b> <b>coefficients</b> are calculated according the analysis results generated on USFOS, taking only the linear elastic spring stiffness. The ‘real’ axial flexibility proved no major contribution to the overall resistance and deformation of the column. Therefore, assuming a fixed column is prudent for practical design. </p...|$|R

Stress-strain {{curves of}} {{some kinds of}} {{materials}} at high strain-rate conditions were able {{to be determined by}} a drop weight experiment system which has only to measure the force-time relation using a load-cell but not to measure directly the deformation or deformation-rate of specimen.
