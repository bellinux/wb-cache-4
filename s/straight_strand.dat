The basic element of these cables is usually a simple <b>straight</b> <b>strand</b> made of a straight core and one layer of helical wires. Several difficulties arise {{in the understanding of}} guided ultrasonic waves in such structures, partly due to the helical geometry and the inter-wire coupling effects. In the context of non-destructive evaluation, this work aims at theoretically investigating the propagation of elastic waves in helical waveguides. A numerical method is chosen based on a semi-analytical finite element technique that relies on a specific non-orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system. This system is shown to be translationally invariant along the helix centerline so that a spatial Fourier transform can be explicitly performed along the axis and the problem is reduced to two dimensions. It is shown that the method can be readily used for the analysis of helical structures by considering the special case of no curvature. Results for single straight and helical wires are first computed in order to validate the approach.

40|$|International audienceThe Dead Sea Transform {{is a major}} strike-slip fault {{bounding}} the Arabia {{plate and}} the Sinai subplate. On the basis of two GPS campaign measurements, 6 years apart, at 17 sites distributed in Israel and Jordan, complemented by Israeli permanent stations, we compute the present-day deformation across the southern segment of the Dead Sea Transform, the Wadi Araba fault. Elastic locked-fault modeling of fault-parallel velocities provides a slip rate of 4. 9 ± 1. 4 mm/a and a best fit locking depth of $ 12 km. This slip rate is slightly higher than previous results based only on Israeli permanent GPS stations data, which are located west of the fault. It is in good agreement with results based on offset geomorphologic and geologic features that average {{longer periods of time}} (10 ka to 1 Ma). Projection in ITRF 2000 reference frame allows using our data, combined with results published earlier, to further study the kinematics between Arabia, Nubia, and Sinai. Systematic combination of Euler poles available in the literature, in addition to our new set of data, shows that a wide range of Arabia-Sinai pole positions and angular velocities predict reasonable slip rate on the Dead Sea fault.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{article focuses}} on flexskins {{comprising}} of a cellular substructure and pre-tensioned facesheet for shear morphing applications. The unit cell of the substructure is a strand with some strain-relief feature, and it supports a segment of pretensioned facesheet. The function of the strain-relief feature {{is to reduce the}} peak strains in the strand and consequently the actuation work during shear morphing. Central hexagonal cells, elliptical cells, and half elliptical cells in the strand provided the sought strain relief {{at the edges of the}} strand, but the sharp corners and the proximity of these central features to those from adjacent strands during shear morphing led to a tendency for the facesheet to wrinkle. Alleviating wrinkling by increasing facesheet pretension increases the morphing actuation work requirement. Facesheet wrinkling can also be reduced by increasing strand separation, but this too requires higher prestrain in the facesheet to limit out-of-plane displacement under aerodynamic loads. The best solution was found to be the use of Gaussian- or Cosine-shaped curved strands which reduced morphing actuation force requirements by around 30 % compared to <b>straight</b> <b>strands</b> used on a previous demonstration aircraft, and the peak strain levels to about 1. 2 % (down from 3. 3 % for <b>straight</b> <b>strands),</b> while avoiding facesheet wrinkling.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2015 Çelik halatlar; her önemli icat gibi bir ihtiyaçtan yola çıkılarak ortaya çıkmış parçalardır ilk örnekleri milattan önce(MÖ) 12000 - 9000 yılları arasında Mısır medeniyetinde rastlanmıştır ayrıca Finlandiya’da bulunan halatların Mezolitik dönemden (MÖ 9000 - 3000) kaldığı, Mısırda bulunan ve devetüyünden yapılan halatların ise 4000 yıldan daha eski olduğu varsayılıyor, orta cağda ise birçok binanın, heykelin ve şu an bildiğimiz tarihi simgelerin yapımında kullanılmıştır. Çelik halatların modern uygulamalarına en yakın örnek, madenlerden cevherleri yüzeye taşımak amacıyla Maden Mühendisi August Julius Albert tarafından 1834 yılında kendi ismi ile anılan (Albert Rope) halatı tasarlaması ile ortaya çıkmıştır, ilk üretilen halat madenlerden cevher taşımaya kullanılmıştır, halat üretilirken amaç sağlam olması ve tekrarlanabilir kuvvetler üzerinde dayanım göstermesidir. Deniz ortamındaki uygulamalar en eski ticaret sistemlerinden biri olan deniz yolunda, yükleri elleçlerken veya güvertede taşınan yüklerin güvenliğini sağlarken karşımıza çıkmaktadır. Çelik halatların tasarımı ve fiziksel modelleme çalışmaları 1800 ’lü yılların başlarından itibaren günümüze kadar birçok çalışmanın konusu olmuştur. Günümüzde çelik tel halatlar; gemilerin yükleme, tahliye ve güvenlik donanımlarının en önemli parçalarından biridirler. Tel halatlar deniz, hava, güneş etkileri altında bulunan ve çalışırken yıpratıcı kuvvetlere en fazla maruz kalan donanımlardır. Can ve mal güvenliğinin söz konusu olduğu şartlar altında çelik tel halatlar, planlı bakım-tutum sistemi içinde çeşitli şekillerde kullanılmakta ve gerektiğinde yenilenmektedirler. Ancak çelik tel halatlar için üretimden itibaren bir kullanım ömrü tanımlanmamış olup kullanılan yerlere göre ömürleri ve dayanıklılıkları tahmini olarak kabul edilmektedir.

Steel wire ropes {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} parts of loading, discharging and safety equipments of a ship. Wire ropes are the most effected equipments from the sea, air, sun and are the most exposed equipment to damaging forces. Steel wire ropes are used for planned maintanence system in different types, when safety of life and property are in question, and renewed when necessary. However, expiring date for steel wire rope is not defined, so that their validity and strengths are predicted depent on their using purposes.   Most wire ropes are constructed from either a single strand, or from several strands that are wound around a core. This core may either be a strand in itself or it may be a fibrous or deformable element. The strand is constructed of wires that are wound around a central wire. In single, straight strands, all wound wires are each configured as a single-helix. However, in a wound strand each wire (except for the central wire of the strand) is configured as a double-helix. The design of wire rope cross-sections dates back to the late 1800 _s (Sayenga, 1980), and has been continuously improved since. Many analytical studies of a multi-layer single strand construction have been proposed in literature (Cardou and Jolicoeur, 1997). Hruska (1952 a,b) and Lanteigne (1985), modeled the mechanical response of a multi-layer single strand construction, assuming a fiber response of each wire (i. e.,ignoring bending and torsion rigidity of the wires). Costello and Phillips (1976), Costello and Miller (1979), All the above studies were limited to a single, <b>straight</b> <b>strand,</b> in which all wound wires are single-helices. Jolicoeur and Cardou (1991) compared the mechanical response of a single strand rope as predicted by all the models mentioned above, and compared these models to experimental measurements of single strands. They showed that the simplifying assumption of fiber-like wires yields good results except for an inaccurate prediction of the torsion stiffness of the single <b>straight</b> <b>strand.</b> However, most cables in use have a more complex cross-section in which most wires are configured as double helices. In order to model the complex cross-section of multi-strand constructions, several modeling approaches (Costello, 1990) have been suggested. Velinsky (1981) and Velinsky et al. (1984) were the first to analyze the mechanical response of a multistrand construction. They extended the procedure developed by Costello and Phillips (1976) and Costello and Miller (1979) to treat a multi-strand construction of frictionless wires. Their modeling procedure is based on the nonlinear equations of equilibrium of a thin helical rod (Love, 1944) and considers the torsion and bending stiffness of the wires. Velinsky et al. computed the resultant tension and torque in a <b>straight</b> <b>strand</b> for uniform elongation and torsion of the <b>straight</b> <b>strand.</b> They then approximated the tension and torque of a wound strand that develop due to extension and twist of the wound strand by the same mechanical relation computed for the <b>straight</b> <b>strand.</b> To complete the model, they included the effect of changes in curvature of the wound strand by an approximation that considered planar bending of a <b>straight</b> <b>strand</b> around a cylinder. Phillips and Costello (1985) generalized Velinskys approach for any kind of wire rope with an Independent Wire Rope Core (IWRC). Their work considered the response of a rope bent over a sheave, and neglected friction forces between adjacent wires. This model was said to be applicable only to well-lubricate ropes or to ropes that are loaded exclusively in tension, without twisting or bending. The models of Velinski and of Philips and Costello give a good approximation of the mechanical response of the rope. However, to obtain complete description of the stress in individual wires there is need to develop a model that will explicitly take into account the double helix construction (e. g., the geometrical treatment of Wang and McKewan (2001)). This complete description will enable to estimate resultant ension, bending and torsion moments, relative displacements and contact forces, and the variations of all these along the individual double-helix wires. This information is essential for predicting fatigue life, wear,and overall mechanical response of the entire rope. It is difficult to conduct an analytical investigation of the mechanical response of wire rope because the kinematics of each wire is very complex. To facilitate an analytic study, it is therefore constructive to assume the kinematics of the wires, calculate the associated mechanical response of the whole construction, and examine the consequences of the assumptions by considering their affect on the validity of the equilibrium equations (Love, 1944). In this thesis, physical changes of steel wire ropes in marine enviroment conditions are investigated experimentally. Steel wire ropes in different sizes,are stored in a place which is built on the shore side and tensile tests of wires are done at the end of the zero, three, six and nine months period of time according to ISO 6892 - 1 standard, then the effects of environment on wire ropes are measured through comparison of result. Unloading of materials, its safety, installation and demounting of the components, and the status of the steel cables depending on time variations in marine environment are examined. Steel ropes are exposed to many corrosive effect during their use where the most important of these is corrosion and abrasion. Addition of these two effects, the metals are exposed to the fatigue. On the ship, the steel ropes are multi-purpose parts where they are either under constantly the load or no load of entire life and in generally unknown exact a lifetime. In our experiment, exposure of any load to the steel wire with the different diameters non artificial sea environment over a year and the particular regular tensile tests whether the results were evaluated.  Steel ropes exposed to a very corrosive effect as known; that is the reason that we have conducted the experiment in order to achieve results with minimal effects. In order to do that, we have tried the no load condition only overlapping consisting of various diameters to wire rope is waited in the platform we aimed to examine the changes. The use of steel cables in order to create a suitable environment ITU Maritime Faculty on the campus of the area close to the sea has been identified, we choose both the field of observation, we can close both experimental applications, and we can perform a location. Rope for the pin to be able to interact with each other and prevent them from a height of 10 cm from the soil to the wood plastic crates are secured with cable ties. Ropes are secured after the controlled and continuous contact with each other is prevented. Also it is not affected from weather conditions with constantly keeping under control. In the artificial platform, we have started from the day on steel ropes soaked in sea-water twice a day and at the end of the tenth month, sea water, rain, snow, wind, humidity, sun, and most importantly, the effects of the naturally exposed.

The solution of this problem is of importance to the textile yarn manufacturing industry where singles yarns, made from long staple fibres, such as wool, are plied together in order to bind the surface fibres more effectively into the plied yarn structure. This produces warp yarns that are more abrasive resistant. A formula for the relationship between the pre-twist in two initially <b>straight</b> <b>strands,</b> and the helix angle of the plied structure obtained when they are allowed to twist together into a balanced ply structure is also derived in Section 4.

40|$|Pretensioned girders {{have been}} {{commonly}} used in bridge construction for years. However, some problems remain that hinder the further application of longer and more heavily prestressed girders. The prestressing force can produce large stresses at both {{the top and bottom}} surfaces of the girders, especially near the ends where self-weight moments are minimal. Additionally, the transfer of large prestressing forces can cause local cracking. Partial debonding of <b>straight</b> <b>strands,</b> harping strands and/or adding top strands are three common approaches to mitigating such problems. However, harping is limited to those strands aligned with the member web, and adding top strands affects the overall stress state of the section. Comparatively, partial debonding is a simple and preferred approach. The total prestress force is introduced to the member gradually, reducing stress concentrations and associated end-region cracking. 	Even so, partial debonding decreases the longitudinal tension capacity particularly when a large number of strands is debonded. Excessive debonding, therefore, can also have detrimental effects of the flexure and shear capacity of the girder. This thesis aims to quantify the effects of partial debonding on initial girder stresses and ultimate girder capacity in an effort to identify acceptable prestressing strand debonding details. 	Two series of AASHTO Type III-VI girders having varying spans, amounts of prestressing and different debonding ratios are systematically analysed for their adherence and consistency with present AASHTO LRFD Specification requirements. The analyses use a purpose-written MATLAB program. Analytically obtained girder capacities are validated with initial design capacities from the PCI Bridge Design Manual. An individual case is presented in order to illustrate the analysis procedure. From this study, acceptable partial debonding ranges, satisfying AASHTO-prescribed stress limits, are obtained. 	Conclusions indicate that the upper limit for an acceptable debonding ratio may be increased from the AASHTO-prescribed 25...|$|R

The strands then wind round each other to form three- and seven-stranded cables. The structures of these cables are not immediately evident from electron micrographs because of the confusing superposition of front and back portions of the cables. But optical diffraction and filtering by the procedure of Klug and DeRosier leads to interpretable images of the cables. Because a micrograph of the seven-stranded cable contains 24 views of the glutamine synthetase molecule, {{it is possible to}} reconstruct the three-dimensional electron density of a cable and its constituent molecules at a resolution of 30 [...] 50 A. This reconstruction confirms that the symmetry of a glutamine synthetase molecule is D 6. It suggests that the single subunit is an oblate ellipsoid with its minor axis (about 48 A) roughly parallel to the 6 -fold axis of the molecule and its major axis (about 63 A) perpendicular to the 6 -fold axis of the molecule. The subunits of the two hexagonal layers of a molecule are eclipsed.

The model is capable of taking into account the effects of tension, shear, torsion, contact, friction and possible local plastic yielding and has been successfully used to predict the global behavior of simple <b>straight</b> wire rope <b>strand</b> as well as the stress distribution, which are very difficult to predict analytically. As most of the strand models, the length of the strand is assumed sufficiently long for the clamping conditions to be negligible. The finite analysis results showed excellent agreement with the analytical theory of Costello and the experimental results obtained by Utting and Jones [6, 7]...|$|R
40|$|Tensile {{tests were}} {{performed}} on a <b>straight</b> steel <b>strand</b> of three layer (12 / 6 / 1) construction, having a core wire diameter of 3. 66 mm and 3. 33 mm diameter helical wires, under conditions of full end-fixity, partial restraint, and ends free from torsional restraint. The torque generated under tensile load was recorded {{as well as the}} strand extension and rotation over a 600 mm gauge length. Wire tensions and bending moments in the outer layer of helical wires were determined at the mid-strand position from the outputs of strain gauges in groups of three with parallel grids and mounted parallel to the wire axis on the crown of each wire. The rate of strand extension under tensile load was found to be greater in tests with reduced torsional restraint, the greatest rate occurring in the free-end test. The strand rotation rate was also found to be greatest in the free-end test. The greatest difference from the theoretically predicted rates occurred in a free-end test with increasing load; predict-ed values of extension and rotation underestimated the test results by 12 and 23 per cent, respectively. Displacement of the load-torque plots occurred in the direction of reducing torque as testing proceeded. This appears to indicate the redistribution of the strand load between the layers of wires. Wire tensions showed a more even sharing of load in the fixed-end condition than in the free-end condition. The increase in rate of tension with strand load was less for most wires in tests with reduced torsional restraint, with the lowest tension rates developing in the free-end condition. For most wires, the rate of bending moment change with strand load was greater (in the sense tending to decrease tensile stress on wire crowns) in tests with reduced torsional restraint. However, the bending moment rates varied greatly between wires, the variation being greater in tests with reduced torsional restraint than in fixed-end tests. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{deoxyhemoglobin}} S (deoxy-HbS) {{double strand}} {{is the fundamental}} building block of both the crystals of deoxy-HbS and the physiologically relevant fibers present within sickle cells. To use the atomic-resolution detail of the hemoglobin-hemoglobin interaction known from the crystallography of HbS {{as a basis for}} understanding the interactions in the fibers, it is necessary to define precisely the relationship between the <b>straight</b> double <b>strands</b> in the crystal and the twisted, helical double strands in the fibers. The intermolecular contact conferring the stability of the double strand in both crystal and fiber is between the β 6 valine on one HbS molecule and residues near the EF corner of an adjacent molecule. Models for the helical double strands were constructed by a geometric transformation from crystal to fiber that preserves this critical interaction, minimizes distortion, and makes the transformation as smooth as possible. From these models, the energy of association was calculated over the range of all possible helical twists of the double strands and all possible distances of the double strands from the fiber axis. The calculated association energies reflect the fact that the axial interactions decrease as the distance between the double strand and the fiber axis increases, because of the increased length of the helical path taken by the double strand. The lateral interactions between HbS molecules in a double strand change relatively little between the crystal and possible helical double strands. If the twist of the fiber or the distance between the double strand and the fiber axis is too great, the lateral interaction is broken by intermolecular contacts in the region around the β 6 valine. Consequently, the geometry of the β 6 valine interaction and the residues surrounding it severely restricts the possible helical twist, radius, and handedness of helical aggregates constructed from the double strands. The limitations defined by this analysis establish the structural basis for the right-handed twist observed in HbS fibers and demonstrates that for a subunit twist of 8 °, the fiber diameter cannot be more than ∼ 300 Å, consistent with electron microscope observations. The energy of interaction among HbS molecules in a double strand is very slowly varying with helical pitch, explaining the variable pitch observed in HbS fibers. The analysis results in a model for the HbS double strand, for use in the analysis of interactions between double strands and for refinement of models of the HbS fibers against x-ray diffraction data...|$|R

40|$|Microtubule-associated protein tau is {{the major}} {{component}} of paired helical filaments (PHFs) associated with the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Tau in the normal brain binds and stabilizes microtubules. Tau isolated from PHFs is hyperphosphorylated, which prevents it from binding to microtubules. Tau phosphorylation has been suggested {{to be involved in}} the development of NFT pathology in the AD brain. Recently, we showed that 14 - 3 - 3 ζ is bound to tau in the PHFs and when incubated in vitro with 14 - 3 - 3 ζ, tau formed amorphous aggregates, single-stranded <b>straight</b> filaments, double <b>stranded</b> ribbon-like filaments and PHF-like filaments that displayed close resemblance with corresponding ultrastructures of AD brain. Surprisingly however, phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated tau aggregated in a similar manner, indicating that tau phosphorylation does not affect in vitro tau aggregation (Qureshi et al (2013) Biochemistry 52, 6445 - 6455). In this study, we have examined the role of tau phosphorylation in tau aggregation in cellular level. We have found that in human M 17 neuroblastoma cells, tau phosphorylation by GSK 3 β or PKA does not cause tau aggregation, but promotes 14 - 3 - 3 ζ-induced tau aggregation by destabilizing microtubules. Microtubule disrupting drugs also promoted 14 - 3 - 3 ζ-induced tau aggregation without changing tau phosphorylation in M 17 cell. In vitro, when incubated with 14 - 3 - 3 ζ and microtubules, nonphosphorylated tau bound to microtubules and did not aggregate. Phosphorylated tau on the other hand did not bind to microtubules and aggregated. Our data indicate that microtubule-bound tau is resistant to 14 - 3 - 3 ζ-induced tau aggregation and suggest that tau phosphorylation promotes tau aggregation in the brain by detaching tau from microtubules and thus making it accessible to 14 - 3 - 3 ζ...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. October 2008. Major: Civil Engineering. Advisors: Carol K. Shield, Catherine E. French. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xxv, 187 pages, appendices A-H. Self-consolidating concrete (SCC), which {{is different from}} conventional concrete especially in its fresh state, is a highly workable concrete that flows through congested reinforcement under its own weight alone, filling the formwork without segregation of its constituent materials with a void-free structure, and can be placed without any vibration. Self-consolidating concrete was first developed in Japan in the early 1980 s, and the main issues that promoted the development of SCC were the shortage of skilled labor {{and the emergence of}} heavily reinforced structures that made it difficult to sufficiently consolidate the concrete which is crucial for its durability. Although some raw materials and chemical admixtures may increase the initial cost, its use is on the rise worldwide for precast concrete construction mainly due to its ease of placement over conventional concrete. Some benefits of using SCC for precast concrete applications are easily quantified such as faster construction, reduced noise level, and improved surface finish which eliminates the need for patching. Other less tangible benefits include worker safety improvements and extended life of the precasting forms. Although SCC has been developed and successfully used for numerous precast and cast-in-place applications worldwide, and both fresh and hardened properties of SCC have been investigated, concerns have remained regarding mix proportioning, acceptance criteria of SCC in its plastic state, and long term behavior (e. g., creep and shrinkage) of SCC precast/pretensioned elements in service. Limited literature is available to evaluate the hardened and long-term behavior of SCC members, particularly creep, shrinkage, and elastic modulus. Furthermore, there is a wide variation in the findings regarding the long-term behavior of SCC. Due to these reasons, many state departments of transportation, including the Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT), have been hesitant to allow SCC for precast bridge girder applications. This study was initiated with the intent to investigate the viability of using SCC developed at local precast plants with locally available materials for the construction of precast prestressed SCC girders in the State of Minnesota. The primary objective of the research was to determine both short-term and long-term properties of SCC bridge girders, evaluate the applicability and accuracy of available test procedures, design equations, and material models for SCC bridge girders. The research was divided into several phases. In the first phase, SCC trial mixes were developed using locally available materials from two local precast concrete plants (Plant-A and Plan-B). The developed trial SCC mixes were studied to identify the main parameters that affect the performance of SCC in its fresh state (e. g., flowability and segregation resistance) such as cement, high-range water reducing admixture dosage, and fresh concrete temperature. It was found that variations in cement from the same supplier with no difference in the cement mill report can significantly affect the flowability of SCC, and recommendations were included for the effect of concrete temperature and admixture dosage on fresh concrete properties. In addition, a testing program was undertaken to evaluate the static and dynamic one-dimensional free flow and flow through reinforcing obstacle segregation resistances of SCC and passing ability of coarse aggregate through reinforcing obstacles. Correlations between different test results were investigated to minimize the required number of test methods to adequately evaluate SCC mixtures. The next phase involved casting four SCC and two conventional concrete precast prestressed bridge girders using locally available materials from Plant-A and Plant-B (three girders per plant). The girders were Mn/DOT 36 M I-girders with a span length of 38 ft, and design concrete compressive strengths of 7. 5 ksi at release and 9. 0 ksi at 28 days. The girders were designed incorporating 36 <b>straight</b> <b>strands</b> in the bottom flange, and four strands in the top flange to avoid the need to drape strands (total of 40 strands). This large amount of prestressed strand was used to create a situation with congested reinforcement to challenge the SCC flow. In addition, the large amount of prestress maximized the allowable compressive stresses at release in the bottom concrete fiber to maximize the concrete creep. The section represented one of the most severe cases for the application of SCC. In addition to the girders, companion cylinders were cast to monitor compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, creep, and shrinkage over time. The girders were instrumented and stored in an outdoor storage site for a period of approximately 2 years to monitor both short-term and long-term performance, which included transfer length, camber, and prestress losses. Both short-term (e. g., elastic shortening) and long-term performance of the girders (e. g., prestress losses) were measured and compared to AASHTO (2004 and 2007), PCI Design Handbook 6 th Edition (2004), and PCI General Method (PCI, 1975) predictions. The results indicated that the predicted total long-term prestress losses calculated with AASHTO 2004, PCI Design Handbook 6 th Edition (2004), and PCI General Method (PCI, 1975) using measured material properties obtained from conventional cylinders were conservative for both SCC and conventional concrete girders (Note that the SCC conventional cylinders were fabricated with a slightly modified process; rather than rodding the cylinders after each lift, the sides of the mold were tapped with a rubber mallet). The predicted long-term losses {{at the end of the}} monitoring periods (i. e., approximately 600 days and 450 days for Plant-A and Plant-B, respectively) were larger than measured losses by 2 to 5 % for AASHTO 2004 Lump Sum Method, 12 to 15 % for AASHTO 2004 Refined Method, 4 to 7 % for PCI General Method, and 8 to 11 % for PCI Design Handbook Method for all girders. However, the long-term prestress losses computed with AASHTO- 2007 (Approximate Estimate of Time-Dependent Losses) were either not conservative or very close to the measured losses for both the SCC and conventional concrete girders at the end of the monitoring periods. The magnitude of the difference between the measured and predicted losses was comparable for both the conventional and SCC girders. Finally the girders were tested in three-point bending to determine the cracking and crack re-opening loads at the University of Minnesota Structures Laboratory. The experimentally measured crack re-opening loads were used to indirectly calculate the remaining effective prestressing forces and total prestress losses. Also, a semi-destructive test method was used to experimentally measure the remaining tendon forces to verify the field measured losses. The measured girder prestress losses were compared to those determined from a fiber-based finite element analysis incorporating time-dependent creep and shrinkage models based on companion cylinder data. The measured, predicted, and calculated prestress losses were generally in good agreement. The study indicated that creep and shrinkage material models developed based on measured companion cylinder creep and shrinkage data can be used to reasonably predict measured field prestress losses of both conventional and SCC prestressed bridge girders...|$|R
