5|$|Arsenal {{defeated}} Tottenham 1–0 on 25 April 2005, {{which meant}} Chelsea needed {{to wait on}} <b>Saturday</b> <b>in</b> order to mathematically win the title.

Goals from Van Persie and Edu earned a 2–0 win for the team and Arsenal beat Champions League finalists Liverpool at Highbury to all-but secure second spot. Arsenal recorded the biggest win of the league season, against Everton at Highbury. An inspired performance by Bergkamp helped the team win 7–0; he created the opening two goals and scored in the second half. Arsenal lost their final game of the campaign, away to Birmingham City. It was a lacklustre performance by the visitors, who equalised through Bergkamp after going a goal behind, but conceded in the 90th minute.|$|E
