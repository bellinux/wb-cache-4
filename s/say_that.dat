5|$|A common {{neologism}} in the Python {{community is}} pythonic, which {{can have a}} wide range of meanings related to program style.

In contrast, code that is difficult to understand or reads like a rough transcription from another programming language is called unpythonic.|$|E

It is also the case that coursing kills slower hares, and it is said by some coursers that this leaves faster hares to breed and multiply.|$|E
