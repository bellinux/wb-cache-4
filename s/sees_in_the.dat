5|$|Folklorist John A. Gutowski <b>sees</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Douglas jackalope {{an example}} of an American tall tale publicized by a local {{community}} that seeks wider recognition. Through a combination of hoax and media activity, the town or other community draws attention to itself for social or economic reasons. A common adjunct to this activity involves the creation of an annual festival to perpetuate the town's association with the local legend.|$|E
5|$|In 787, Offa {{had persuaded}} the Church {{to create a}} new archbishopric at Lichfield, {{dividing}} the archdiocese of Canterbury. The new archdiocese included the sees of Worcester, Hereford, Leicester, Lindsey, Dommoc, and Elmham; these were essentially the midland Anglian territories. Canterbury retained the <b>sees</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south and southeast. Hygeberht, already Bishop of Lichfield, was the new archdiocese's first and only archbishop.|$|E

5|$|During Edward's reign, Stigand was an {{influential}} advisor at court {{and used his}} position to increase his own wealth {{as well as that}} of his friends and family. Contemporary valuations of the lands he controlled at the death of King Edward, as listed in Domesday Book, come to an annual income of about 2500 pounds. There is little evidence, however, that he enriched either Canterbury or Winchester. He also appointed his followers to sees within his diocese in 1058, having Siward named Bishop of Rochester and Æthelric installed as Bishop of Selsey. Between his holding of two sees and the appointment of his men to other <b>sees</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southeast of England, Stigand was an important figure in defending the coastline against invasion.|$|E
5|$|Keith {{questions}} Veronica {{about whether}} or not she broke into the house, despite knowing her guilt. Jake and a county prosecutor tell Keith that they will get a judge's order and will return to prosecute Veronica. The supercomputer processes the names of all the Castle members just as Keith hands over the surveillance tape to the county prosecutor. Logan tries to apologize to Veronica. One of the Castle members comes up and tells her that the organization videotaped her, and Logan assaults him. Veronica returns the tape to Jake Kane on the condition that he does not tell Keith about it. She <b>sees</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> newspaper that charges have been filed against Keith for tampering with evidence relating to Veronica's break-in, likely meaning that he will lose the votes needed to win the sheriff's election. She goes into a voting booth and votes for Keith as sheriff, walking away in pouring rain.|$|E

25|$|At {{an early}} date mystical {{reasons for the}} {{division}} of the day were sought. St. Cyprian <b>sees</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hours of Terce, Sext and Nones, which come after a lapse of three hours, an allusion to the Trinity. He adds that these hours already consecrated to prayer under the Old Dispensation have been sanctified in the New Testament by great mysteriesTerce by the descent of the Holy Spirit on the Apostles; Sext by the prayers of St. Peter, the reception of the Gentiles into the Church, or yet again by the crucifixion of Christ; Nones by the death of Christ. St. Basil merely recalls that it was at the ninth hour that the Apostles Peter and John were wont to go to the Temple to pray. St. John Cassian, who adopts the Cyprian interpretation for Terce and Sext, <b>sees</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hour of Nones the descent of Christ into hell. But, as a rule, it is the death of Christ that is commemorated at the Hour of Nones.|$|E

25|$|In {{their search}} for an early identity, English Canadians relied heavily on loyalty and {{attachment}} to the British Empire, a triumphalist attitude towards British role {{in the building of}} Canada, as evidenced in the lyrics of the informal anthem The Maple Leaf Forever and distrust or dislike of those who were not British or Protestant. John Ralston Saul <b>sees</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> influence of the Orange Order the counterpart of the Ultramontane movement among French Canadians, leading certain groups of English Canadian Protestants to provoke persecution of the Métis and suppress or resist francophone rights.|$|E
25|$|During {{the seven}} years when he was {{prevented}} from teaching, he produced, besides the Fragments, the edition {{of the works of}} Proclus (6 vols., 1820-1827), and the works of René Descartes (II vols., 1826). He also commenced his Translation of Plato (13 vols.), which occupied his leisure time from 1825 to 1840. One <b>sees</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Fragments very distinctly the fusion of the different philosophical influences by which his opinions were finally matured. For Cousin was as eclectic in thought and habit of mind as he was in philosophical principle and system. It is with the publication of the Fragments of 1826 that the first great widening of his reputation is associated. In 1827 followed the Cours de l'histoire de la philosophie.|$|E

25|$|The Textus Receptus was {{defended by}} John William Burgon in his The Revision Revised (1881), {{and also by}} Edward Miller in A Guide to the Textual Criticism of the New Testament (1886). Burgon {{supported}} his arguments with the opinion that the Codex Alexandrinus and Codex Ephraemi, were older than the Sinaiticus and Vaticanus; and also that the Peshitta translation into Syriac (which supports the Byzantine Text), originated in the 2nd century. Miller's arguments in favour of readings in the Textus Receptus were of the same kind. However, both Burgon and Miller believed that, although the Textus Receptus was to be preferred to the Alexandrian Text, nevertheless it still required to be corrected in certain readings against the manuscript tradition of the Byzantine text. In this judgement they have been criticised by Edward F. Hills. Hills argues that the principle that God provides truth through scriptural revelation, necessarily also implies that God must ensure a preserved transmission of the correct revealed text, continuing into the Reformation era of biblical translation and printing. For Hills, the task of biblical scholarship is to identify the particular line of preserved transmission through which God is acting; a line which he <b>sees</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> specific succession of manuscript copying, textual correction and printing, which culminated in the Textus Receptus and the King James Bible. Hills argues that the principle of providentially preserved transmission guarantees that the printed Textus Receptus must be the closest text to the Greek autographs; and consequently he rejects readings in the Byzantine Majority Text where these are not maintained in the Textus Receptus. He {{goes so far as}} to conclude that Erasmus must have been providentially guided when he introduced Latin Vulgate readings into his Greek text; and even argues for the authenticity of the Comma Johanneum.|$|E

500|$|The Catholic {{population}} in the United States was growing, and Bishop John Carroll had for some time wished for his vast diocese to be divided into more manageable territories.

Among the new sees was the Diocese of Philadelphia, which included the states of Pennsylvania and Delaware {{as well as the}} western and southern parts of New Jersey. Even before the diocese was created, Carroll had determined to recommend Egan for the post, writing to Rome that Egan [...] "was truly pious, learned, religious, remarkable for his great humility, but deficient, perhaps, in firmness and without great experience in the direction of affairs".|$|E
