5|$|Observations of Titan {{prior to}} the <b>space</b> <b>age</b> were limited. In 1907 Spanish {{astronomer}} Josep Comas i Solà observed limb darkening of Titan, the first evidence that the body has an atmosphere. In 1944 Gerard P. Kuiper used a spectroscopic technique to detect an atmosphere of methane.|$|E
5|$|This model, {{known as}} the nebular hypothesis, was first {{developed}} in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy, physics, geology, and planetary science. Since {{the dawn of the}} <b>space</b> <b>age</b> in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar planets in the 1990s, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations.|$|E
5|$|Titan is {{primarily}} composed of water ice and rocky material. Much as with Venus before the <b>Space</b> <b>Age,</b> the dense opaque atmosphere prevented understanding of Titan's surface until new {{information from the}} Cassini–Huygens mission in 2004, including the discovery of liquid hydrocarbon lakes in Titan's polar regions. The geologically young surface is generally smooth, with few impact craters, although mountains and several possible cryovolcanoes have been found.|$|E
40|$|Solid rocket {{propellant}} and {{rocket motor}} components were aged in a vented container {{on the interior}} of the LDEF. This paper will present the results of aging the Improved Performance Space Motor-II/Payload Assist Module-Delta II (IPSM-II/PAM-DII) space motor components. Ballistic and mechanical properties of the <b>space</b> <b>aged</b> main propellant, igniter propellant, and ignition system were compared with similar data from preflight and ground aged samples. Mechanical properties of the composite materials and bonded joints used in the motor case, insulation, liner, nozzle, exit cone, and skirt were similarly evaluated. The <b>space</b> <b>aging</b> results will be compared to data collected in a ground based vacuum aging program on similar components. The operation of the vacuum actuated venting valve and pressure actuated resealing of the container will also be addressed. The materials tested showed no significant changes due to <b>space</b> <b>aging.</b> These results indicate that properly designed solid rocket motors can be expected to perform reliably after extended periods of exposure to a space environment...|$|R

5|$|The planets {{were thought}} by Ptolemy to orbit Earth in deferent and {{epicycle}} motions. Although {{the idea that}} the planets orbited the Sun had been suggested many times, {{it was not until the}} 17th century that this view was supported by evidence from the first telescopic astronomical observations, performed by Galileo Galilei. At about the same time, by careful analysis of pre-telescopic observation data collected by Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler found the planets' orbits were not circular but elliptical. As observational tools improved, astronomers saw that, like Earth, the planets rotated around tilted axes, and some shared such features as ice caps and seasons. Since the dawn of the <b>Space</b> <b>Age,</b> close observation by space probes has found that Earth and the other planets share characteristics such as volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics, and even hydrology.|$|E
5|$|This {{experimental}} {{freedom was}} fully exercised on the Daddies' second album, Rapid City Muscle Car. Self-produced and self-recorded, Rapid City Muscle Car was the band's attempt at creating an eclectic concept album wherein each track was composed {{in a different}} musical style, yet were all thematically united through interconnected lyricism. Anchored in funk and swing, the album featured genre experiments in ska punk, psychedelic rock, country, rockabilly, big band, hard rock and lounge. Released on the band's self-operated label <b>Space</b> <b>Age</b> Bachelor Pad Records in December 1994, the album sold decently, though failed to match the success of Ferociously Stoned.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, American News Company, by far {{the largest}} {{magazine}} distributor, was liquidated. Almost all the science-fiction magazines had to find a new distributor, and the smaller independent companies remaining in the market often demanded monthly publication and a larger format from the magazines they took on. Many of the magazines did not have the advertising revenue required to support these changes, and within two or three years, many of them had disappeared: the number of science-fiction magazines being published dropped from a high of 46 in 1953 to less than a dozen {{by the end of the}} decade. For a while If was hard to find on the news stands, but it survived. Quinn did try the slick format (using glossy paper, unlike the cheaper paper used for pulps and digests) for a companion magazine, <b>Space</b> <b>Age,</b> which he launched in November 1958; the experiment was unsuccessful, however. In an attempt to improve Ifs circulation, Quinn hired writer Damon Knight, whose first issue was October 1958. Circulation failed to increase, though this was at least partly due to the problems with distribution, and by early 1959, Quinn decided to sell the magazine. Knight's last issue was his third, dated February 1959.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Space</b> <b>Age</b> is {{a period}} {{encompassing}} the activities related to the Space Race, space exploration, space technology, and the cultural developments influenced by these events. The <b>Space</b> <b>Age</b> began {{with the development of}} several technologies that culminated with the launch of Sputnik 1 by the Soviet Union in October 1957. This was the world's first artificial satellite, orbiting the Earth in 98.1 minutes and weighing in at 83kg. The launch of Sputnik 1 ushered a new era of political, scientific and technological achievements that became known as the <b>Space</b> <b>Age.</b> The <b>Space</b> <b>Age</b> was characterized by rapid development of new technology in a close race mostly between the United States and the Soviet Union. The <b>Space</b> <b>Age</b> brought the first human spaceflight during the Vostok programme and reached its peak with the Apollo program which captured the imagination of much of the world's population. The landing of Apollo 11 was an event watched by over 500 million people around the world and is widely {{recognized as one of the}} defining moments of the 20th century. Since then and with the end of the space race due to the dissolution of the Soviet Union, public attention has largely moved to other areas.|$|E
