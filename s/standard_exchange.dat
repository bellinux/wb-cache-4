40|$|Data {{interchange}} in {{the form}} of a <b>standard</b> <b>exchange</b> format(SEF) is only a first step towards tool interoperability. Inter-tool communication using files is slow and cumbersome; a better approach would be an application program interface, or API, that allowed tools to communicate with each other directly. This paper argues such an AP is a logical next step that builds on the current drive towards an SEF. It presents high-level descriptions of three approaches to tool-totool APIs and illustrates how requirements for the SEF also apply to the API.
