40|$|Abstract. This lecture {{provides}} a {{short history of}} agricultural tractors and wheel equipment. A list of basic tire terms {{used to describe the}} tire profile is covered, along with performance criteria used to match mechanical front drive axles to the rear axle for proper gearing. In addition, the RCI table is introduced to provide a visual example of how tires can be grouped by rolling circumference and overall diameter. A description of tire <b>size</b> <b>designations</b> is listed for bias, radial, and flotation sizing. The load rating designations for ply, star, and load index is also explained. The five most common tread designs for powered axles are defined, with examples of the different patterns. Two examples of the creation of new tire sizes are given: one for large, high-horsepower, four-wheel drive tractors, and one for high-capacity row crop sprayers. Cyclical loads and their restrictions are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Today’s {{clothing}} industry {{is based on}} a system where clothes are made in ready-to-wear sizes and meant to fit most people. Studies have pointed out that consumers are discontent with the use of these systems: <b>size</b> <b>designations</b> are not accurate enough to find clothing that fits, and different sizes are poorly available. This article discusses in depth who these consumers are, and which consumer groups are the most dissatisfied with today’s sizing systems. Results are based on a web survey where 2834 Nordic consumers responded, complemented with eight in-depth interviews, market analysis on clothing sizes and in-store trouser size measurements. Results indicate that higher shares of the consumers who have a body {{out of touch with the}} existing beauty ideals express discontentment with the sizing systems and the poor selection available. In particular, large women, very large men, and thin, short men are those who experience less priority in clothing stores and have more difficulties in finding clothes that fit. Consumers tend to blame themselves when the clothes do not fit their bodies, while our study points out that the industry is to blame as they do not produce clothing for all customers...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1979 The {{purpose of}} the study was to explore the {{possible}} acceptance of metric conversion for clothing sizes and sizing standardization by a selected sample of female ready-to-wear clothing consumers. A questionnaire was designed to elicit consumer's positive or negative attitudes toward metric conversion for clothing sizes and sizing standardization. The 54 -item questionnaire also incorporated measures of selected items of consumer background information including: attitude toward metric conversion in the U. S. A., attitude toward change, level of metric knowledge, perceived fashion innovativeness, educational level, and age group. The questionnaire was mailed to 500 women residing in Thurston County, Washington. Respondents were systematically selected by computer from 32 randomly selected polling precincts out of 128 total precincts. The initial mailing and the three-week follow-up of non-respondents included a hand-signed cover-letter, the questionnaire booklet, and a first-class return envelope. A total of 288 usable replies (57. 60) were included in the study. Descriptive statistics were employed in the analysis of individual questions and each composite measure. The Pearson correlation coefficient and the chi-square test of independence were used to analyze relationships between variables. The significance level was set at. 05. Consumers expressed a positive attitude toward metric conversion for clothing sizes, sizing standardization, metric conversion in the U. S. A., and change. Most of the 288 women possessed "some" to "a great deal of" metric knowledge, were educated beyond high school, were between 18 and 41 years of age, and perceived themselves as adopting new styles about the same time as most other people. The consumers desired a period of dual labeling for apparel, preferably permanently, and acknowledged that metric <b>size</b> <b>designations</b> on dual labels probably would be ignored. The women agreed that size markings should be actual body measurements, yet most were reluctant to abandon nominal codes. Aesthetically appealing, simple, <b>size</b> <b>designations</b> were supported. Rationalized metric sizes were ultimately preferred over soft conversion methods. The present system of sizing by style and age group was satisfactory to more than half of the respondents, although some voiced discontent with their inability to purchase fashionable styles in all size ranges. The women agreed that current sizes are not uniform, supported elimination of vanity sizing and the reduction of overlapping sizes between groups, and wished to rectify sizing discrepancies between brand and price levels through use of the metric system. Simultaneous sizing standardization and metric clothing size conversion was viewed as possibly too confusing by a slight majority; in order to avoid confusion, most respondents felt mandatory conversion by the industry was necessary. Consumers concurred that shopping for metric clothing sizes would not really be any more difficult, and that increased uniformity in apparel sizes would result in less need to try on garments and increased confidence when shopping for gifts and through catalogues. Significant relationships were found to exist between consumers' attitude toward metric conversion for clothing sizes and the following variables: attitude toward sizing standardization, level of metric knowledge, attitude toward metric conversion in the U. S. A., attitude toward change, and educational level. Significant relationships could not be established between consumers' attitude toward metric conversion for clothing sizes and perceived fashion innovativeness or age group...|$|E

40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate various measures of cattle size. Records from three separate studies (herds) at Texas A&M University were used to evaluate relationships of birth and weaning measures (n = 750) with size and productivity of females (n = 2, 800 records from 450 animals) and carcass traits (n = 450) of steers. Cattle were F 1 crosses sired by Angus, Brahman, Boran, Gir, Indu-Brazil, Nellore, and Tuli. Relationships between cow traits and carcass traits of steer mates were also investigated. Animals were classified into Small, Medium and Large frame size categories based on weaning age hip heights. Considerable differences in cow weight were observed within the same frame size category, and larger differences in weight within the same frame category was observed across study herds (which also differed in breed composition) than between different frame size categories within study herds in most cases; however, the large degree of confounding between frame size category and breed type prevented conclusive findings solely based on frame size category. Cow weight appeared to plateau at parity five, and in these data, this was considered to represent mature cow weight. Ranking of steer carcass weights based on frame score category followed expectations within study herds, but similar to cow weights these also varied considerably within the same frame category across study herds. Birth weight and cannon bone length accounted for 0 to 40 % of the variation in parity-five weight of females and 1 to 52 % of the variation in hot carcass weight of steer mates depending upon sire breed and study herd; use of weaning (weight, height, frame score) traits accounted for 2 to 46 % of the variation in parity-five weight of females and 13 to 67 % of the variation in hot carcass weight of steer mates, again depending upon sire breed. Different patterns were observed between females and males depending upon sire breed. Based on results seen here weaning age designation of cattle frame size may not be a precise classification of mature size, similar frame <b>size</b> <b>designations</b> can vary considerably in weight across different genetic types, and mature size classification of beef cows alone does not guarantee productivity measures, particularly when frame size is confounded with genetic background...|$|E
