500|$|Although the Army's {{focus was}} on {{conventional}} warfare, in late 1940 Lieutenant Colonel J.C. Mawhood, a British officer, arrived in Australia with a small <b>specialist</b> <b>staff</b> to conduct training in unconventional warfare. A school, known as No. 7 Infantry Training Centre, was opened at Wilsons Promontory, Victoria, which was described as [...] "an isolated area of high, rugged and heavily timbered mountains, precipitous valleys, swiftly running streams, and swamps." [...] The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Independent Companies and a nucleus of the 4th were raised by October 1941 when training was discontinued. After {{the outbreak of the}} war with Japan, the school was reopened as the Guerrilla Warfare School, the training of the fourth company was completed. These independent companies were later redesignated as commando squadrons, of which twelve were eventually raised, including the 1st, which had been destroyed early in the war; as the war progressed they were used more in the flank protection and reconnaissance roles than for unconventional warfare.|$|E
2500|$|The {{operations}} of the Financial Regulator were severely criticised in a report marked [...] "strictly confidential and not for publication", as being poor value for money. [...] The report stated that there were too few <b>specialist</b> <b>staff,</b> compared with its peers. There were also serious shortcomings in the crucial supervisory area. and the report was particularly critical of the regulator’s senior management structure, concluding that a clear management and oversight framework, which ensures that issues are escalated through the organisation, was [...] "not fully in place".|$|E
2500|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of EMDs will perform their work in an EMS dispatch centre. [...] Occasionally this may involve some 'site work', such as on-site dispatching for large special events, but this is somewhat rare. [...] EMS dispatching may be a single, independent process, {{or it may be}} a mixed function with {{one or more of the}} other emergency services. [...] In some smaller jurisdictions, the EMS, fire and police dispatch functions, and even the 9-1-1 system may be physically co-located, but with different <b>specialist</b> <b>staff</b> performing each function. Such decisions are frequently made based on the sizes of the services involved, and their call volumes. [...] While some jurisdictions are required, generally through economics or size, to provide a single public safety dispatch system, the three emergency services have requirements and procedures that are sufficiently different that wherever possible, independent dispatching is preferred. Even in truly large, mixed (fire and EMS) services, such as the New York City Fire Department, the functions and requirements are seen as sufficiently different that an independent dispatch function is maintained for each. [...] The emergency services in question all have their own priorities, and while they are extremely important to each, those priorities often simply conflict too greatly to allow reasonable joint dispatch functions. To illustrate, in a scenario with a single dispatcher for both fire and EMS: the truck officer on a fire apparatus is requesting additional resources for a working fire with a possibility of trapped people, and two paramedics are attempting to resuscitate a dying child, but require medical direction, which request gets priority? [...] Another important consideration is workload; in many jurisdictions the call volume of the EMS system is 5-6 times as great as that of the Fire Department. [...] Asking fire service dispatchers to also dispatch EMS resources, or vice versa, may exceed the capabilities of the dispatchers. [...] Even when joint dispatching is pursued by a community, the various types of dispatch functions to support EMS, fire and police are so different that the dispatchers involved will require separate training and certification in each.|$|E
