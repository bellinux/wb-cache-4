Miniature endplate potentials (MEPPs) were recorded in a high K+ solution, and effects on transmitter release were monitored using estimates of the quantal release parameters m (number of quanta released), n (number of functional transmitter release sites), p (mean probability of release), and vars p (spatial variance in p). Administration of CaM, but not heat-inactivated CaM, encapsulated in liposomes (1000 units ml− 1) produced an increase in m (25 %) that was due {{to an increase in}} n. MEPP amplitude was not altered by CaM. Administration of antiCaM, but not heat-inactivated antiCaM, in liposomes (50 μl ml− 1) produced a progressive decrease in m (40 %) that was associated with decreases in n and p. MEPP amplitude was decreased (15 %) after a 25 min lag time, suggesting a separation in time between the decreases in quantal release and quantal <b>size.</b> <b>Bath</b> application of the membrane-permeable CaM antagonist W 7 (28 μM) produced a gradual decrease in m (25 %) that was associated with a decrease in n.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} {{in the realm of}} computational modeling of complex multiphysics phenomena in articular cartilage enabled efficient and precise determination of articular cartilage properties. However, still accurate quantification of complicated indentation and diffusion processes tying closely with the inhomogeneity of articular cartilage remains challenging. In the present thesis accurate approaches are proposed to capture the mechanical and physical behavior of articular cartilage as faithfully as possible. Finite element models (FE-models) capable of detecting contact between indenter and cartilage surface are developed and applied to spherical indentation process. To predict mechanical and physical properties of cartilage artificial neural networks (ANN) were used and to guarantee the efficacy of the generated ANN they were trained using simulated noisy force-time data. The combination of FE-model and ANN trained with noisy data allowed obtaining cartilage properties robustly. FE-models taking the inhomogeneity of articular cartilage into account were developed and validated and applied to capture neutral (biphasicsolute model) and charged (multiphasic model) solute transfer across articular cartilage in a finite bath experimental setup. Those models could capture the behavior of solute diffusion across cartilage and provide diffusivities and fixed charge densities (FCD) of different cartilage zones. An algorithm consisting of inverse and forward ANNs was developed to obtain the diffusivities of cartilage layers which eliminates the need for computational expertise. The final goal of this algorithm is to introduce a methodology by which properties of cartilage can be determined without any need for computational expertise, which provides a promising opportunity to meet the needs for clinics when it comes to assess the healthiness of articular cartilage during osteoarthritis progression. Effects of bath osmolarity, concentration and charge of solute were investigated using a combination of micro-CT experiments and FE-models. The results suggested that solute charge unlike the osmoalrity and solute concentration {{had a profound effect on}} solute diffusion. Porosity and thickness of subchondral plate were identified as two primary factors affecting the diffusion of neutral solutes across subchondral plate. Using a developed multi-zone biphasic-solute model allowed obtaining the diffusivities of cartilage layers as well as subchondral plate. Using a multi-zone biphasic-solute model, we found that overlying bath <b>size,</b> <b>bath</b> stirring and thickness of the formed stagnant layer can substantially influence the diffusion across cartilage.

The spin bath is described by the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model and the bath spins are subjected to a transverse magnetic field. We investigate the qubit interacting via either an Ising- or an XY-type coupling term to subsets of bath spins of differing size. The large degree of symmetry of the bath allows us to find parameter regimes where the initial qubit state is revived at well defined times after the qubit preparation. These times may become independent of the <b>bath</b> <b>size</b> for large <b>baths</b> and thus enable faithful qubit storage even in the presence of strong coupling to a bath.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the time dependence of correlation {{functions in the}} central spin model, which describes the electron or hole spin confined in a quantum dot, interacting with a bath of nuclear spins forming the Overhauser field. For large baths, a classical description of the model yields quantitatively correct results. We develop and apply various algorithms in order to capture the long-time limit of the central spin for <b>bath</b> <b>sizes</b> from 1000 to infinitely many bath spins. Representing the Overhauser field in terms of orthogonal polynomials, we show that a carefully reduced set of differential equations is sufficient to compute the spin correlations of the full problem up to very long times, for instance up to 10 ^ 5 ħ/J_Q where J_Q is the natural energy unit of the system. This technical progress renders {{an analysis of the}} model with experimentally relevant parameters possible. We benchmark the results of the algorithms with exact data for a small number of bath spins and we predict how the long-time correlations behave for different effective numbers of bath spins.
