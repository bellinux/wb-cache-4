5|$|At {{the age of}} 19 {{and still}} at The Scots College, Arthur applied to join the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). He enlisted on 4September 1939, the day after Australia's entry into World WarII. Training at RAAF <b>Station</b> <b>Point</b> Cook, Victoria, and RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, he was {{commissioned}} a pilot officer on 30March 1940, despite being prone to airsickness early on. He served initially with No.22 (City of Sydney) Squadron at Richmond, operating Hawker Demons and Avro Ansons.|$|E
5|$|Brian Eaton {{was born}} in Launceston, Tasmania, on 15December 1916, to Sydney and Hilda Eaton. The family later moved to Canterbury, Victoria, and Brian was educated at Carey Grammar. His early {{ambition}} {{to be a doctor}} was curtailed when his father died and he had to leave school early. He enlisted as an air cadet in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) on 20January 1936, undergoing flying training at RAAF <b>Station</b> <b>Point</b> Cook.|$|E
5|$|Jackson {{followed}} his eldest brother, John, into the Royal Australian Air Force Reserve, {{known as the}} Citizen Air Force, in July 1937. With the outbreak of World WarII, Les was called up for active duty in the RAAF on 6November 1939. He learnt to fly as an air cadet at RAAF <b>Station</b> <b>Point</b> Cook, Victoria. Graduating as a pilot in February 1940, he served initially with No.23 Squadron at Archerfield, Queensland. In July 1941, he was posted to the South West Pacific theatre with No.21 Squadron in Singapore. Initially operating CAC Wirraways, the unit converted to Brewster Buffalos in September that year.|$|E

5|$|The Zeus missile began {{testing in}} 1959 at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) and early {{launches}} were generally successful. Longer range testing {{took place at}} Naval Air <b>Station</b> <b>Point</b> Mugu, firing out over the Pacific Ocean. For full-scale tests, the Army built an entire Zeus base on Kwajalein Island in the Pacific, where it could be tested against ICBMs launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Test firings at Kwajalein began in June 1962; these were very successful, passing within hundreds of yards of the warheads, and even low-flying satellites.|$|E
5|$|Hannah {{joined the}} Royal Australian Air Force on 15January 1935 as an air cadet at RAAF <b>Station</b> <b>Point</b> Cook, Victoria. After graduating from No.1 Flying Training School (No.1 FTS), he {{obtained}} his commission {{as a pilot}} officer in July 1936. His first posting was to No.22 Squadron at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales. Promoted to flying officer, he was appointed adjutant with the newly formed No.23 Squadron at RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria, in May 1937. Hannah accompanied the squadron, which operated Hawker Demons and Avro Ansons, to its new location at the recently opened RAAF Station Pearce, Western Australia, in March 1938. On 5January 1939, he married Patricia Gordon at Claremont; the couple had a daughter. Having specialised as an instructor, he then served {{on the staff of}} No.1 FTS, Point Cook.|$|E
5|$|No. 5 Service Flying Training School (No.5 SFTS) was a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) flight {{training}} unit that operated during World WarII. It {{was one of}} eight Service Flying Training Schools established by the RAAF to provide intermediate and advanced flying instruction to new pilots as part of Australia's contribution to the Empire Air Training Scheme. No.5 SFTS was formed at RAAF Station Uranquinty, New South Wales, in October 1941, and disbanded in February 1946. Its staff and equipment were employed to re-establish No.1 Flying Training School, which transferred to RAAF <b>Station</b> <b>Point</b> Cook, Victoria, the following year. Care and Maintenance Unit Uranquinty was also formed from No.5 SFTS's facilities, to look after surplus aircraft at the base prior to their disposal, and disbanded in December 1948.|$|E
40|$|Photogrammetry is {{a science}} which obtains {{reliable}} measurements by a means of pho-tographs, {{and it can be}} aerial or terrestrial. This study is done in KTH main Campus on L building located at Drottning Kristinas väg 30. It assessed the precision of Trim-ble total station S 8 for photogrammetric point measurement relative to the coordi-nates measured with a total station. The steps performed in the study were: planning the measurements (selection of the study area, selection of the instruments, selection of the <b>station</b> <b>points,</b> selection of the software and putting the target points over the facade), data acquisition and finally data processing in TBC software. In the work, sys-tematic error tests were carried out, and the tests results show that there are systematic errors in easting and northing of the measurement result, however it was difficult to say there is or there is no systematic error in the elevation. The most likely source of these errors might be an incorrect orientation of the camera. It was seen that there were some factors influenced the precision of photogrammetric point measurements, such as image redundancy and parallax angle between images. The precision assess-ment was done by calculating photogrammetric points; from different parallax angles between images and from different numbers of images which were taken from differ-ent <b>station</b> <b>points.</b> The better results or smaller differences between the total station and photogrammetric coordinates were detected from five <b>station</b> <b>points</b> relative to four and three <b>station</b> <b>points</b> and from parallax angle in range 60 - 105 degree relative to parallax angles in range 30 - 60 and 0 - 30 degrees. In general, precise photogrammet-ric coordinates were obtained from parallax angle in range 60 - 105 degree and from five <b>station</b> <b>points.</b> Keywords: Photogrammetry; precision; <b>station</b> <b>points,</b> checkpoints, Trimble total sta-tion, Trible Business Center...|$|R

It also demonstrates her impulsive streak; she sides with the native Alflololians against Galaxity and Valérian with no thought for the personal consequences she may have to face herself.

5|$|Flying {{instruction}} in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) underwent major changes following the outbreak of World WarII, {{in response to a}} vast {{increase in the number of}} aircrew volunteers and the commencement of Australia's participation in the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS). The Air Force's pre-war pilot training facility, No.1 Flying Training School at RAAF <b>Station</b> <b>Point</b> Cook, Victoria, was supplanted in 1940–41 by twelve elementary flying training schools (EFTS) and eight service flying training schools (SFTS). The EFTS provided a twelve-week introductory flying course to personnel who had graduated from one of the RAAF's initial training schools. Flying training was undertaken in two stages: the first involved four weeks of instruction (including ten hours of flying) to determine trainees' suitability to become pilots. Those that passed this grading process then received a further eight weeks of training (including sixty-five hours of flying) at the EFTS. Pilots who successfully completed this course were posted to an SFTS in either Australia or Canada for the next stage of their instruction as military aviators.|$|E

In October 1925 the flight was transferred to RAAF Station Richmond outside of Sydney. On 31 March 1926 the first two of six Supermarine Seagull III amphibian flying boats which had been purchased to re-equip No. 101 Flight arrived in Australia. All of the aircraft were delivered by June that year, and at this time most of the flight's personnel were members of the RAN.

25|$|In August 1947, No.1 Flying Training School, {{which had}} been known as No.1 Service Flying Training School under the wartime Empire Air Training Scheme and disbanded in 1944, was re-established at RAAF <b>Station</b> <b>Point</b> Cook, Victoria. Responsible at that stage for all flight {{instruction}} of air cadets, its aircraft initially included one Avro Anson, two De Havilland Tiger Moths, and 55 CAC Wirraways. In response to demands for more aircrew to fulfil Australia's commitments to the Korean War and Malayan Emergency, RAAF flying training underwent significant change in 1951–52. No.1 Initial Flying Training School was raised at Archerfield, Queensland, to impart students with general aeronautical and military knowledge, after which they received flight grading on Tiger Moths. Graduates {{went on to the}} newly formed No.1 Basic Flying Training School (No.1 BFTS) at Uranquinty, New South Wales, where they underwent further instruction, first on Tiger Moths and then on Wirraways. Finally they transferred to No.1 FTS, which was renamed No.1 Applied Flying Training School (No.1 AFTS) in March 1952, for advanced instruction and combat training on Wirraways.|$|E
