500|$|Throughout the war, the King and Queen {{provided}} morale-boosting visits {{throughout the}} United Kingdom, visiting bomb sites, munitions factories, and troops. The King visited military forces abroad in France in December 1939, North Africa and Malta in June 1943, Normandy in June 1944, southern Italy in July 1944, and the Low Countries in October 1944. Their high public profile and apparently indefatigable determination secured their place {{as symbols of}} national resistance. At a social function in 1944, Chief of the Imperial General Staff Sir Alan Brooke, revealed that every time he met Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery he thought Montgomery was after his job. The King replied: [...] "You <b>should</b> <b>worry,</b> when I meet him, I always think he's after mine!" ...|$|E
2500|$|On November 16, 2005, in {{an article}} titled [...] "Woodward Was Told of Plame More Than Two Years Ago", {{published}} in The Washington Post, Jim VandeHei and Carol D. Leonnig revealed that Bob Woodward was told of Valerie Wilson's CIA affiliation a month before it was reported in Robert Novak's column and before Wilson's July 6, 2003 editorial in The New York Times. At an on-the-record dinner at a Harvard University Institute of Politics forum in December 2005, according to the Harvard Crimson, Woodward discussed the matter with fellow Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein, responding to Bernstein’s claim that the release of Plame’s identity was a [...] "calculated leak" [...] by the Bush administration with [...] "I {{know a lot about}} this, and you're wrong." [...] The Crimson also states that [...] "when asked at the dinner whether his readers <b>should</b> <b>worry</b> that he has been 'manipulated' by the Bush administration, Woodward replied, 'I think you <b>should</b> <b>worry.</b> I mean, I worry.'" ...|$|E

[...] He did, however, publicise a patent granted to the National Security Agency in August 1999, for voice-data harvesting technology: [...] "This patent <b>should</b> <b>worry</b> people. Everyone's overseas phone calls are or may soon be tapped, transcribed and archived {{in the bowels of}} an unaccountable foreign spy agency." [...] Systematic abuse of technology by governments against fundamental freedoms of world citizens remained an abiding concern— more than a decade later, in the introduction to Cypherpunks (2012), Assange summarised: [...] "the Internet, our greatest tool for emancipation, has been transformed into the most dangerous facilitator of totalitarianism we have ever seen".|$|E
2500|$|When Bryant {{joined the}} Lakers in camp, O'Neal told reporters Bryant should {{look to be}} more of a passer than a scorer until Bryant's knee was fully healed. Bryant responded that he knew how to play the guard position, and O'Neal <b>should</b> <b>worry</b> about the low post. O'Neal responded, [...] "Just ask Karl and Gary why they came here. One person. Not two. One. Period." [...] O'Neal agreed that Bryant could handle playing guard, but Bryant needed advice on how to play team ball. O'Neal added that he would voice his {{opinions}} as he saw fit because the Lakers were his team. He said that if Bryant, who would be a free agent at the season's end, didn't like what O'Neal had to say, Bryant should just opt out since O'Neal said [...] "I ain't going nowhere." [...] Jackson told the team to not discuss the issue further with reporters.|$|E
2500|$|As empress, Empress Zhangsun {{was said}} to be frugal and humble, taking only the {{supplies}} that she needed without living luxuriously. [...] When Li Chengqian's wet nurse the Lady Sui'an stated that his palace lacked sufficient goods and requested more, she replied, [...] "All a crown prince <b>should</b> <b>worry</b> about is not having enough virtues or enough fame. [...] Why worry about not having enough goods?" [...] It was also said that she rarely got angry with the ladies in waiting and eunuchs who served her. [...] She often gave Emperor Taizong examples from history to inspire him to rule better. [...] At times, if Emperor Taizong got angry at the ladies in waiting or eunuchs for no reason, she would pretend to be angry as well and ask to personally interrogate them and hold them in custody; she would then wait until his anger had subsided, and then begin to plead on their behalf, thus reducing improper punishments within the palace. [...] It was said that whenever Emperor Taizong's concubines or ladies in waiting would be ill, she would personally visit them and reduce her own expenditures to treat them.|$|E

Why should he deny himself happiness? Instead of being miserable, waiting for his fate, he chooses to be happy. Says Rong Qiqi: For humans, a life of hardship is the norm and death is the end.

2500|$|The new Foreign Minister Rafael Roncagliolo met his Chilean {{counterpart}} Alfredo Moreno Charme {{prior to}} taking office. Following the meeting {{he said that}} Moreno was [...] "a concerned person, who has an attitude of dialogue and does not encourage unnecessary antagonism" [...] and added that {{in regards to the}} Chilean–Peruvian maritime dispute [...] "by going to the Hague, what we are looking for is peaceful understanding, avoid lawsuits and verbal arguments. Peru has taken the position of a modern civilized nation to go to court. Resolve conflicts by means of right reason, not force." [...] However he also commented on Chilean military spending vis-a-vis its neighbours: [...] "When a country develops a quite disproportionate military capacity compared to their neighbours, others are right to worry. That is the situation we face. Yes, we <b>should</b> <b>worry.</b> Chile's military spending is disproportionate to the neighbours. That is why Peru, in UNASUR is promoting transparency and a reduction of military spending. There are more important things you must invest in Latin America. All countries must have a credible military defense, and Peru has not maintained one like this." ...|$|E
2500|$|All {{reactors}} in the United States {{are required}} by law to have a containment building. [...] The walls of containment buildings are several feet thick and made of concrete and therefore can stop the release of any radiation emitted by the reactor into the environment. If a person is to worry about an energy source that releases large amounts of radiation into the environment, they <b>should</b> <b>worry</b> about coal-fired plants. [...] "The waste produced by coal plants is actually more radioactive than that generated by their nuclear counterparts. In fact, the fly ash emitted by a [...] power plant—a by-product from burning coal for electricity—carries into the surrounding environment 100 times more radiation than a nuclear power plant producing the same amount of energy." [...] Coal-fired plants are much more hazardous to people’s health than nuclear power plants as they release much more radioactive elements into the environment and subsequently expose people to greater levels of radiation than nuclear plants do. [...] "Estimated radiation doses ingested by people living near the coal plants were equal to or higher than doses for people living around the nuclear facilities. At one extreme, the scientists estimated fly ash radiation in individuals' bones at around 18 millirems (thousandths of a rem, a unit for measuring doses of ionizing radiation) a year. Doses for the two nuclear plants, by contrast, ranged from between three and six millirems for the same period. And when all food was grown in the area, radiation doses were 50 to 200 percent higher around the coal plants." ...|$|E

40|$|Brazil is {{the largest}} {{exporter}} and third largest producer in the chicken meat market. Consequently, {{it is important to}} know the relationship between domestic and export prices. Through the Granger causation method and the cointegrating method of Engle and Granger and the Johansen one, this study aims to verify the hypothesis of long-term relationship between both domestic and export prices of chicken meat. The results indicate that prices are cointegrated. The conclusion is that the prices received by the Brazilian producers are possibly sensible to the behavior of world market prices, and therefore they <b>should</b> <b>worried</b> about internal factors which may enlarge differences between both prices.
