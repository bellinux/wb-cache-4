50|$|The {{steam engines}} were very inefficient and used 8 lb of <b>slack</b> <b>coal</b> per horsepower/hour.At {{the start of}} 1891 the Severn Tweed Company {{replaced}} them with much more cost-effective gas motors.However, {{by the end of}} the 19th century the mills in Newton were no longer competitive with those in the north of England.There was a disastrous fire in 1910, and another in 1912, after which the mill was not rebuilt.After the Cambrian Mills closed, Newtown was no longer an important woollen industrial centre and many of the workers moved elsewhere. Price-Jones's company remained profitable until the Great Depression. It was sold to a firm in Liverpool in 1938.The site today is the Cambrian Gardens district of Newtown.|$|E

5000|$|In 1840 George Stephenson, in {{building}} the North Midland Railway, discovered deposits of coal at Clay Cross and formed what later became the Clay Cross Company. He realised that burning lime would provide a use for the <b>coal</b> <b>slack</b> that would otherwise go to waste. He leased Cliff Quarry and built limekilns at Bullbridge. They were connected by another wagonway including a section known as [...] "The Steep", a [...] self-acting incline at a slope of 1 in 5.|$|R
40|$|AbstractDue to {{the nature}} of coal bed, <b>slack</b> <b>coal</b> {{production}} is inevitable in gas recovery sby water drainage. When coalbed methane (CBM) wells are reentered after low energy exploitation and shut-in, the negative effect of <b>slack</b> <b>coal</b> production on productivity of CBM is irreversible. In this paper, the CBM occurrence characteristics and multi-lateral horizontal well trajectory in the Qinshui Basin, Shanxi Province, were analyzed. In the multi-lateral horizontal wells, the expected gas production rate could not be reached and the production rate after shut-in maintenance could not restore to the level before shut-in. The reason for these issues is that migration pathways in the reservoirs are blocked by <b>slack</b> <b>coal</b> deposits, while formation water and <b>slack</b> <b>coal</b> deposit accumulated at the troughs of horizontal sections enlarge the resistance for gas to flow into the bottom hole. Furthermore, three key technologies to deal with <b>slack</b> <b>coal</b> blockage were proposed. Firstly, CBM horizontal well trajectory should follow the principle of keeping the wellbores smooth and updip instead of being “wavy”, on the premise of guaranteeing CBM drilling rate. Secondly, the cavities of production wells, as an important part of multi-lateral horizontal wells, are capable of settling sand, and can be used for gas–liquid–solid separation. And thirdly, a tree-like horizontal well with its main hole set on stable seam top or floor, provides a stable well flushing passage for coal powder. This research provides a useful attempt in solving the problem of <b>slack</b> <b>coal</b> production in gas recovery by water drainage...|$|E
40|$|Coal, in India and Worldwide, is cleaned {{predominantly}} by {{dense medium}} separations and jigging. But {{when it comes}} to cleaning of fine coals such as mine dust, <b>slack</b> <b>coal,</b> washing rejects and slurries, froth flotation method of coal cleaning has better efficiency and handling. In this method of wet cleaning, froth is made in a flotation cell by bubbling air through water in presence of frothing agents; on addition, pure and light coal adhere to air bubble while the dirtier part sinks to bottom of the cell. Thus clean coal is recovered from the collected froth amount. Density and wettability can be termed as the two bases of separation which are the inherent properties of the coal. In this current project froth flotation was being carried in a fixed froth flotation cell used in the laboratory. Runs of froth flotation have been carried out using the same stock of coal but varying the size of coal fines, concentration of coal slurries and different doses of collecting agents and of their mixtures. In order to quantitatively measure the effect, ash rejection, combustible recovery and efficiency were calculated. Effect of size of particles in slurry was very much visible while the combustible recovery and ash rejection was enhanced when higher dose of collecting agents were used. Use of advanced frothing agents and pH controllers can be studied further in this direction...|$|E
50|$|Paraffin {{oxidation}} is {{a historical}} industrial process {{for the production of}} synthetic fatty acids. The fatty acids are further processed to consumer products such as soaps and fats as well as to lubricating greases for technical applications. <b>Coal</b> <b>slack</b> wax, a saturated, high molecular weight hydrocarbon mixture and by-product of the Fischer-Tropsch process was used as raw material. Side products were a wide range of carboxylic acids and oxidation products such as alcohols, aldehydes, esters, or ketones. The oxidation of paraffins was carried out in the liquid phase by molecular oxygen in the presence of catalysts such as permanganates, at temperatures in the range of about 100 to 120 °C and under atmospheric pressure.|$|R
50|$|The Newcomen Engine was by {{no means}} an {{efficient}} machine, although it was probably as complicated as engineering and materials techniques of the early 18th century could support. Much heat was lost when condensing the steam, as this cooled the cylinder. This did not matter unduly at a colliery, where unsaleable small <b>coal</b> (<b>slack)</b> was available, but significantly increased the mining costs where coal was not readily available, as in Cornwall. Newcomen's engine was gradually replaced after 1775 in areas where coal was expensive (especially in Cornwall) by an improved design, invented by James Watt, in which the steam was condensed in a separate condenser. The Watt steam engine, aided by better engineering techniques including Wilkinson's boring machine, was much more fuel efficient, enabling Watt and his partner Matthew Boulton to collect substantial royalties based on the fuel saved.|$|R

Later in life, Choe embarked on a quest to bring the recipe of gunpowder to Korea. He visited China, which was then ruled by the Mongolian Yuan Dynasty. In general, technology of that region, such as cotton growing and gunpowder manufacture, was kept secret. Choe sought to smuggle some examples of secret items, and eventually was able to obtain knowledge of the three key ingredients of gunpowder: sulfur, <b>slack</b> or fine <b>coal,</b> and potassium nitrate. However, the process to obtain niter, the mineral form of potassium nitrate, was difficult, and {{he did not know how}} to prepare gunpowder from the raw materials.|$|R
40|$|Many {{types of}} carbon-containing organic {{compounds}} and all possible carbon-containing products or wastes in low demand {{can be used}} to produce thermal energy. A technology has been developed for producing highly flammable briquettes on the basis of bituminous coal. These briquettes have a special incendiary layer. It is easily ignites from low energy heat sources (e. g. matches), and then flame spreads to the rest of briquette. Use of <b>coal</b> <b>slacks</b> and paper wastes as carbon-containing components playing the role of binders provides an opportunity to get a fuel briquette easy in terms of production and plain in composition {{while at the same time}} dispose of coal and paper wastes. Such briquettes may also have a special incendiary layer. Technology for fuel briquettes production from wood and slate wastes employed no binding agents, as wood products acted as binders. Thus technologies have been developed to produce fuel briquettes from various carbon-containing materials in low demand. The briquettes are intended for household boilers, fireplaces, different ovens in order to cook food, heat residential and utility premises, cabins, etc...|$|R
