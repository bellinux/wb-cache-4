25|$|In March 2016, General Motors bought Cruise Automation, a San Francisco <b>self-driving</b> vehicle start-up, {{to develop}} <b>self-driving</b> cars {{that could be}} used in ride-sharing fleets.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{developments}} in autonomous automobiles {{have made the}} innovation of <b>self-driving</b> trucks possible, though the they {{are still in the}} testing phase. The UK government has passed legislation to begin testing of <b>self-driving</b> truck platoons in 2018. <b>Self-driving</b> truck platoons are a fleet of <b>self-driving</b> trucks following the lead of one non-self-driving truck, so the truck platoons aren't entirely autonomous yet. Meanwhile, the Daimler, a German automobile corporation, is testing the Freightliner Inspiration which is a semi-autonomous truck that will only be used on the highway.|$|E

25|$|On December 14, 2016, Uber {{began using}} <b>self-driving</b> Volvo XC90 SUVs in its {{hometown}} of San Francisco. On December 21, 2016, the California Department of Motor Vehicles revoked the registration of the 16 vehicles Uber was using {{for the test}} and forced the program to cease operations in California. Uber then moved the program to Arizona, where the cars are picking up passengers, albeit with 2 Uber engineers in the front seats as a safety precaution. In March 2017, an Uber <b>self-driving</b> car was flipped on its side by a vehicle which failed to yield.|$|E
25|$|Many {{components}} {{contribute to}} the functioning of <b>self-driving</b> cars. These vehicles incorporate systems such as braking, lane changing, collision prevention, navigation and mapping. Together, these systems, as well as high performance computers, are integrated into one complex vehicle.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, Kalanick {{spoke about}} {{his desire to}} {{eventually}} move to using <b>self-driving</b> cars for Uber vehicles. By May 2015, the company had hired many researchers from the robotics department of Carnegie Mellon University and established Uber's Advanced Technologies Center in Pittsburgh's Strip District.|$|E
25|$|Advancements in AI {{have contributed}} to the growth of the {{automotive}} industry through the creation and evolution of <b>self-driving</b> vehicles. As of 2016, there are over 30 companies utilizing AI into the creation of driverless cars. A few companies involved with AI include Tesla, Google, and Apple.|$|E
25|$|As such, as of 2016 GPUs {{are popular}} for AI work, and they {{continue}} to evolve in a direction to facilitate deep learning, both for training and inference in devices such as <b>self-driving</b> cars. - and gaining additional connective capability for the kind of dataflow workloads AI benefits from (e.g. Nvidia NVLink).|$|E
25|$|High-profile {{examples}} of AI include autonomous vehicles (such as drones and <b>self-driving</b> cars), medical diagnosis, creating art (such as poetry), proving mathematical theorems, playing games (such as Chess or Go), search engines (such as Google search), online assistants (such as Siri), image recognition in photographs, spam filtering, prediction of judicial decisions and targeting online advertisements.|$|E
25|$|On September 14, 2016, Uber {{launched}} its first <b>self-driving</b> car services to select customers in Pittsburgh, including Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto using {{a fleet of}} Ford Fusion cars each equipped with 20 cameras, seven lasers, GPS, lidar and radar equipment that enables the car to create a three-dimensional map utilizing landmarks and other contextual information {{to keep track of}} its position.|$|E
25|$|On May 12, 2016, Apple Inc., {{invested}} US$1billion in Didi Chuxing, a Chinese competitor to Uber. The Information {{reported in}} October 2016 that Apple {{had taken a}} board seat in Didi Chuxing, a move that James Vincent of The Verge speculated could be a strategic company decision by Apple {{to get closer to}} the automobile industry, particularly Didi Chuxing's reported interest in <b>self-driving</b> cars.|$|E
25|$|In October 2017, General Motors {{acquired}} Strobe, a {{solid state}} LIDAR company. Strobe’s prototypes produce brief “chirps” of frequency-modulated (FM) laser light, where the frequency within each chirp varies linearly. Measuring the phase {{and frequency of}} the echoing chirp allows the system to directly measure both the distance and the velocity of objects in the road ahead. Strobe, Cruise and GM will work together to develop the technology for future <b>self-driving</b> cars.|$|E
25|$|In May 2017, Ford {{announced}} cuts to {{its global}} workforce amid {{efforts to address}} the company's declining share price and to improve profits. The company is targeting $3 billion in cost reduction and a nearly 10% reduction in the salaried workforce in Asia and North America this year to enhance earnings in 2018. Jim Hackett was announced to replace Mark Fields as CEO of Ford Motor. Mr. Hackett most recently oversaw the formation of Ford Smart Mobility, a unit responsible for experimenting with car-sharing programs, <b>self-driving</b> ventures and other programs aimed at helping the 114-year-old auto maker better compete with Uber Technologies Inc., Alphabet Inc. and other tech giants looking to edge in on the auto industry.|$|E
25|$|One main {{factor that}} {{influences}} {{the ability for}} a driver-less automobiles to function is mapping. In general, the vehicle would be pre-programmed with {{a map of the}} area being driven. This map would include data on the approximations of street light and curb heights in order for the vehicle to be aware of its surroundings. However, Google has been working on an algorithm with the purpose of eliminating the need for pre-programmed maps and instead, creating a device that would be able to adjust to a variety of new surroundings. Some <b>self-driving</b> cars are not equipped with steering wheels or brakes, so there has also been research focused on creating an algorithm that is capable of maintaining a safe environment for the passengers in the vehicle through awareness of speed and driving conditions.|$|E
25|$|Fully {{autonomous}} vehicles, {{also known}} as driverless cars, already exist in prototype (such as the Google driverless car), {{and are expected to}} be commercially available around 2020. According to urban designer and futurist Michael E. Arth, driverless electric vehicles—in conjunction with the increased use of virtual reality for work, travel, and pleasure—could reduce the world's 800 million vehicles to a fraction of that number within a few decades. This would be possible if almost all private cars requiring drivers, which are not in use and parked 90% of the time, would be traded for public <b>self-driving</b> taxis that would be in near constant use. This would also allow for getting the appropriate vehicle for the particular need—a bus could come for a group of people, a limousine could come for a special night out, and a Segway could come for a short trip down the street for one person. Children could be chauffeured in supervised safety, DUIs would no longer exist, and 41,000 lives could be saved each year in the US alone.|$|E
500|$|The Astonishing is Dream Theater's second concept album after 1999's [...] Described as an [...] "honest-to-God rock opera" [...] by Rolling Stone, it {{has been}} {{compared}} to The Who's Tommy (1969), Rush's 2112 (1976), Pink Floyd's The Wall (1979), and Queensrÿche's [...] (1988). 2112 also revolves around music being used to achieve freedom in a futuristic setting. The album's story was inspired by Petrucci's love of fantasy and science fiction franchises such as Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars, as well as his observations on the role of technology in modern-day society. In an interview with Billboard, he explained, “I was thinking of all of the things now that people used to do that they don’t do anymore because they’re automated or done by robots: lots of jobs, <b>self-driving</b> cars coming right around the corner ... My thought was, 'What would happen if ... music [...] all artificial?’” ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, Caterpillar Inc. {{developed}} [...] a {{dump truck}} which can drive itself without any human operator.

2500|$|Obama {{took steps}} to promote various {{technologies}} and the technological prowess of the United States. The number of American adults using the internet grew from 74% in 2008 to 84% in 2013, and Obama pushed programs to extend broadband internet to lower income Americans. Over the opposition of many Republicans, the Federal Communications Commission began regulating internet providers as public utilities, {{with the goal of}} protecting [...] "net neutrality." [...] Obama launched 18F and the United States Digital Service, two organizations devoted to modernizing government information technology. The stimulus package included money to build high-speed rail networks such as the proposed Florida High Speed Corridor, but political resistance and funding problems stymied those efforts. In January 2016, Obama announced a plan to invest $4 billion in the development of <b>self-driving</b> cars, as well as an initiative by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to develop regulations for <b>self-driving</b> cars. That same month, Obama called for a national effort led by Vice President Biden to develop a cure for cancer.|$|E

2500|$|Kurzweil {{touches on}} some modern {{applications}} of advanced AI including Google's <b>self-driving</b> cars, IBM's Watson which beat the best human players {{at the game}} Jeopardy!, the Siri personal assistant in the Apple iPhone or its competitor Google Voice Search. He contrasts the hand-coded knowledge of the Douglas Lenat's Cyc project with the automated learning of systems like Google Translate and suggests the best approach {{is to use a}} combination of both, which is how IBM's Watson was so effective. Kurzweil says that John Searle's has leveled his [...] "Chinese Room" [...] objection at Watson, arguing that Watson only manipulates symbols without meaning. Kurzweil thinks the human brain is [...] "just" [...] doing hierarchical statistical analysis as well.|$|E
2500|$|The Electronic Frontier Foundation {{has raised}} {{concerns}} that companies {{can use the}} technologies necessary to support connected devices to intentionally disable or [...] "brick" [...] their customers' devices via a remote software update or by disabling a service necessary to {{the operation of the}} device. In one example, home automation devices sold with the promise of a [...] "Lifetime Subscription" [...] were rendered useless after Nest Labs acquired Revolv and made the decision to shut down the central servers the Revolv devices had used to operate.

2500|$|Will {{is among}} those advocating that China needs to focus {{intensely}} on AI. Speaking to government officials and administrators in May, he said {{the first half of}} the internet age—in which companies raced to connect computing machines with people—has finished. [...] "The second half is about artificial intelligence," [...] he said. DiDi has established a big data research center to focus on AI technologies including machine learning and computer vision, which will optimize its dispatch system and route planning. A few hundred scientists work on the deep-learning technologies. At this stage, Will said that the company is investing a lot of resources in research and is keen to recruit and retain top talent to build its <b>self-driving</b> cars and to make itself become one of the top technology companies in the world.|$|E
2500|$|Today, {{there are}} more than 25 million Botts' dots in use in California, though they have started falling out of favor. In 2017, Caltrans {{announced}} that it would stop using Botts' dots as the sole indicator of lane division, due to cost, worker safety, and in order to make roadways more compatible with <b>self-driving</b> cars. Reflective lane markings will be wider and thicker, providing some of the tactile feedback the Botts' dots provided. In California, highway lanes may be marked either solely by Botts' dots, or dots placed over painted lines. [...] Four dots are used for broken lines on freeways, and broken lines on surface streets may use only three dots. [...] Reflective Stimsonite pavement markers are placed at regular intervals between Botts' dots to increase the visibility of lane markings at night. [...] In the Las Vegas area of southern Nevada, roads with multiple lanes use four pavement markers for each broken white line, a reflective Stimsonite marker followed by three Botts' dots.|$|E
