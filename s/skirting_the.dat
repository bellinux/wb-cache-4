5|$|<b>Skirting</b> <b>the</b> {{inner edge}} of the belt (ranging between 1.78 and 2.0 AU, with a mean semi-major axis of 1.9AU) is the Hungaria family of minor planets. They are named after the main member, 434 Hungaria; the group {{contains}} at least 52 named asteroids. The Hungaria group is separated from the main body by the 4:1 Kirkwood gap and their orbits have a high inclination. Some members belong to the Mars-crossing category of asteroids, and gravitational perturbations by Mars are likely a factor in reducing {{the total population of}} this group.|$|E
5|$|<b>Skirting</b> <b>the</b> {{outer edge}} of the {{asteroid}} belt is the Cybele group, orbiting between 3.3 and 3.5AU. These have a 7:4 orbital resonance with Jupiter. The Hilda family orbit between 3.5 and 4.2AU, and have relatively circular orbits and a stable 3:2 orbital resonance with Jupiter. There are few asteroids beyond 4.2AU, until Jupiter's orbit. Here the two families of Trojan asteroids can be found, which, at least for objects larger than 1km, are approximately as numerous as the asteroids of the asteroid belt.|$|E

5|$|After , {{the road}} bent {{back to the}} east, leaving the {{woodlands}} behind as it passed south of the Miner Institute. The research complex led to another stretch of isolated homes along NY191, centered on the route's interchange with the Adirondack Northway (I-87). Not far from the junction, NY191 entered the hamlet of Chazy, a small community located on the Little Chazy River. The route bypassed most of Chazy, <b>skirting</b> <b>the</b> northern edge of the hamlet as it headed northeast to a junction with US9. NY191 ended here while CR23 follows the state-maintained US9 south into downtown Chazy.|$|E
5|$|M-96 {{starts at}} an {{intersection}} between King Highway and Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) east of downtown Kalamazoo. From this point, it follows King Highway over and then along the Kalamazoo River through a suburban residential area. The highway then follows Michigan Avenue east through Comstock {{and north of}} Morrow Lake. At Galesburg, M-96 turns northeast along Augusta Drive to Augusta, running through rural farmland. It turns eastward again, <b>skirting</b> <b>the</b> Fort Custer State Recreation Area and the Fort Custer National Cemetery. In Augusta, M-96 turns to follow Dickman Road to Battle Creek, passing north and east of the W. K. Kellogg Airport on Dickman and Helmer roads.|$|E
5|$|Maintaining {{its peak}} {{intensity}} {{for over a}} day, the hurricane gradually slowed its forward motion and weakened. By September13, Debbie's motion became influenced by the Westerlies, causing the system to accelerate east-northeastward. The system passed over the western Azores as a minimal hurricane on September15. At this point, there is uncertainty as {{to the structure of}} Debbie, whether it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone or maintained its identity as a tropical system. Regardless of which took place, the system deepened as it neared Ireland, <b>skirting</b> <b>the</b> coast of Western Ireland on September16. Shortly thereafter, the system was confirmed to have become extratropical as it continued towards the northeast. The remnants of the storm later turned eastward, striking Norway and Russia, before dissipating on September19.|$|E

In Lewiston, the expressway meets NY31 at exit24 southwest of the large Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant reservoir. I-190 continues onward, crossing the canal between the reservoir and the power plant on a small dam also used by NY265. The freeway then interchanges with NY265, the Niagara Scenic Parkway, and NY104 at the expansive exit25 before curving {{to the west and}} terminating at the approach to the Lewiston–Queenston Bridge. Across the bridge in Queenston, Ontario, the roadway becomes Highway405.|$|E
5|$|Philippe moved {{farther north}} <b>skirting</b> <b>the</b> low and {{continued}} to weaken gradually. The official forecast did not predict this, primarily {{as a result of}} some models indicating a reintensification to hurricane status. Philippe began to loop around the center of the non-tropical system, weakening as it did so. As Philippe turned towards Bermuda it weakened into a tropical depression on September 22. The depression degenerated into a remnant low the next day and this remnant continued to loop cyclonically and could be tracked for a further day or two within the circulation of the non-tropical system.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Chris was {{the fourth}} {{tropical}} storm of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season. Forming on July 31 in the Atlantic Ocean east of the Leeward Islands from a tropical wave, Chris moved generally to the west-northwest, <b>skirting</b> <b>the</b> northern fringes of the Caribbean islands. Chris was a relatively short-lived storm, reaching a peak intensity with winds at 65mph (100km/h) on August 2, while positioned north of St. Martin. The storm gradually weakened before finally dissipating on August 5, near eastern Cuba. Overall impact was minimal, amounting to moderate amounts of rainfall throughout its path. No deaths were reported.|$|E

5|$|A compact cyclone, Fred quickly {{reached its}} peak {{strength}} as a hurricane, with a minimum central pressure of 986mbar (hPa; 29.12inHg) and 85mph (140km/h) winds. Through the rest of August31, the hurricane traversed the Barlavento Islands of Cape Verde, barely <b>skirting</b> <b>the</b> southern coast of Boa Vista around 12:00UC. Gradually decreasing in definition, the eye passed north of São Nicolau and then north-northeast of Santo Antão over the next 12hours. On September1, drier air and stronger wind shear aloft dispersed the convection around the cyclone's core, causing Fred to diminish to a tropical storm. The weakened storm turned slightly toward the west-northwest, over considerably cooler waters, in response to high pressure rebuilding to its north. Through much of September14, Fred produced limited convective activity, with intermittent flares of thunderstorms that were continuously blown away from the center by the strong upper winds. Despite the adverse environment and the storm's lack of stable convection, Fred maintained a robust spiral of low-level clouds and gales during this period, defying the NHC's repeated forecasts of its dissipation.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Belle was {{a strong}} {{tropical}} cyclone that caused moderate damage across the East Coast of the United States in August1976. In late July, a tropical wave emerged off {{the west coast of}} Africa. Traversing the Atlantic Ocean for more than a week, the system eventually consolidated into a tropical depression near the Bahamas on August6. Remaining nearly stationary for a day, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm on August7 and a hurricane later that day as it acquired a northwest motion. Formation of an eye accompanied quick intensification and Belle reached its peak the following day with winds of 120mph (195km/h). The hurricane subsequently turned north and accelerated, <b>skirting</b> <b>the</b> Outer Banks of North Carolina. Early on August10, Belle made landfall on Long Island, New York, as a minimal hurricane crossing Long Island Sound and hitting the central coast of Connecticut as strong tropical storm. Thereafter, Belle transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over New England before moving over Atlantic Canada. The system turned east while over the north Atlantic and ultimately dissipated on August15 to the south of Iceland.|$|E
5|$|In the centre, the 2/15th Infantry Battalion set {{out from}} Katika to capture Nongora on 30 November. They {{advanced}} over broken countryside and after the lead company had crossed the Song River, they were engaged by machine-gun fire from a strong defensive position. This held them up briefly, until the other companies came up. <b>Skirting</b> <b>the</b> position, they continued on towards Nongora where they stopped short of the high ground and established a defensive position for the night. The following morning, the Australians launched a costly and unsuccessful company-level attack against the ridge, but after darkness the Japanese abandoned the position, allowing the 2/15th to occupy it and then clear Nongora on 2 December. Following this, they began sending fighting patrols out towards the Christmas Hills area in the west, and to the east towards the Lakes {{to make contact with}} the 24th Brigade.|$|E

25|$|Greater Mexico City is {{connected}} through a private network of toll expressways {{to the nearby}} cities of Querétaro, Toluca, Cuernavaca, Pachuca and Puebla. Ring roads are the Circuito Interior (inner ring), Anillo Periférico; the Circuito Exterior Mexiquense ("State of Mexico outer loop") toll road <b>skirting</b> <b>the</b> northeastern and eastern edges of the metropolitan area, the Chamapa-La Venta toll road <b>skirting</b> <b>the</b> northwestern edge, and the Arco Norte completely bypassing the metropolitan area in an arc from west (Toluca) to north (Tula) to east (Puebla). A second level (where tolls are charged) of the Periférico, colloquially called the segundo piso ("second floor"), was officially opened in 2012, with sections still being completed. The Viaducto Miguel Alemán crosses the city east-west from Observatorio to the airport. In 2013 the Supervía Poniente opened, a toll road linking the new Santa Fe business district with southwestern Mexico City. Inside the city, ejes viales; high-volume, mostly one-way roads, cross the city {{from side to side}} in a vast numbered system.|$|E
