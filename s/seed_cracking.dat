40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} study the influence of commercial maize seed processing on seed quality. In particular, it aimed to determine: 1) the particular stage or stages of processing which could be responsible for a reduction in seed germination, 2) whether <b>seed</b> <b>cracking</b> contributes {{to the problem of}} seed deterioration after storage, 3) which of the various stages of processing <b>seed</b> <b>cracking</b> occurs, 4) possible ways of reducing seed damage caused by seed processing. The results showed that seed processing adversely affected seed quality. The damage which occurred, however, did not cause any immediate reduction in seed viability but was strongly implicated in hastening seed deterioration in storage. The stages of seed processing which most likely contributed to a reduction in seed germination following storage were cob drying, seed drying, shelling and the final stages of dressing, grading and treating. Hybrid XL 72 aa was less susceptible to processing damage than Hybrids D 54 and XL 81 although the former had less potential to germinate as indicated by its lower initial seed germination. Remarkable levels of stress cracking occurred due to seed drying. In this particular experiment, stress cracking had no direct damaging effect on essential seed structures even though it hastened seed deterioration in storage {{depending on the type of}} cracks. Stress cracks which were not seen by X-ray in a longitudinal position but which could often be seen visually did not affect seed viability after storage for 12 months. This kind of crack appeared as tiny shallow cracks in a transverse line in seeds on an X-ray plate. Similarly, fissures located outside the germ area as revealed by X-ray radiography had no adverse effect on seed viability after storage. However, cracks which were detected by X-ray along the side or extending into the germ area seriously reduced seed viability in storage. X-ray radiography is a useful technique for determining the specific location or magnitude of <b>seed</b> <b>cracking</b> in maize and can be used to critically assess the likely affects of <b>seed</b> <b>cracking</b> on seed storage longevity. Machine shelling at a seed moisture content of 22 % produced more broken seeds than shelling at either 18 % or 14 % moisture content. After ear drying, tempering of the ears before shelling reduced the level of stress cracking after seed drying, particularly at temperatures of 30 C and 20 C. Generally, the germination after storage was higher in seeds from tempered ears before shelling than from ears which were not tempered at this stage. Reducing seed drying temperature from 40 C to 20 C drastically reduced the levels of stress cracking and resulted in better seed viability after storage. Seed drying starting with a initial seed moisture content of 14 % at 30 C or 18 % at 40 C reduced the level of stress cracking. After seed drying, seed tempering at the same drying temperature of 40 C did not reduce stress cracking but did reduce seed viability after storage. Seed tempering at a drying temperature of 30 C reduced stress cracking and resulted in higher seed viability after seed storage compared with non-tempered seeds. Tempering had no effect when seeds were dried at 20 C. This study has clearly shown that mechanical seed processing is a major contributory cause of reduction in seed quality. Although seed damage may not be evident before seed storage it is clearly involved in hastening seed deterioration in storage. The study concludes that particular attention to ensure artificial seed drying at a relatively lower temperature and lower initial seed moisture content and tempering, play an important part in ensuring that seed damage and deterioration are both greatly reduced...|$|E

Unfortunately, {{little is known}} about the details on the relation between the beak design and its performance. In continuation of the work of Bowman [1], we aim to unravel this causal link by comparing the osteological variation in beak design of the different Darwin’s finches with that of a model organism, the Java sparrow (Padda oryzivora, a large‐beaked species not closely related to Darwin’s finches), and link this to mechanical capacities of the upper beak for dealing with mechanical stress. It is hypothesized that the beak morphology reflects the performance in <b>seed</b> <b>cracking.</b> Based on micro‐CT scanning of 12 different species, including species with long, pointed beaks (e. g., Certhidea olivacea and Camarhynchus pallidus) to species with deep, broad beaks (e. g., Geospiza magnirostris and Padda oryzivora), three‐dimensional models of the beak have been made.

40|$|Darwin's finches are a {{model system}} in {{ecological}} and evolutionary research, but surprisingly {{little is known}} about their skull morphology and development. Indeed, only the early beak development and external variation in adult beak shape has been studied. Understanding the development of the skull from embryo up to the adult is important to gain insights into how selection acts upon, and drives, variation in beak shape. Here, we provide {{a detailed description of the}} skeletal development of the skull in the medium ground finch (Geospiza fortis). Although the ossification sequence of the cranial elements is broadly similar to that observed for other birds, some differences can be observed. Unexpectedly, our data show that large changes in skull shape take place between the nestling and the juvenile phases. The reorientation of the beak, the orbit and the formation of well-developed processes and cristae suggest that these changes are likely related to the use of the beak after leaving the nest. This suggests that the active use of the jaw muscles during <b>seed</b> <b>cracking</b> plays an important role in shaping the adult skull morphology and may be driving some of the intra-specific variation observed in species such as G. fortis. Investigating the development of the jaw muscles and their interaction with the observed ossification and formation of the skull and lower jaw would allow further insights into the ecology and evolution of beak morphology in Darwin's finches...|$|E

Analytical tools used include frequency, percentage and Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient. Findings showed {{that the majority of}} respondents had no formal education (73. 3 %), were middle aged (52. 2 %), and married (81. 1 %). The indigenous processing techniques commonly used by the respondents include: picking/harvesting of fruits, washing of fruits, de-pulping, drying, seed selection, <b>seed</b> <b>cracking,</b> roasting of kernels, milling of kernels, boiling of ground kernels, kneading, mixing, filtration, solidification and packaging. The majority (75 %) of sources for information on indigenous shea butter processing came from family members. Factors limiting the majority of respondents were: inadequate water supply (95 %), inadequate processing equipment (86. 1 %) and inadequate credit facilities (81. 7 %). Correlation analysis results revealed that age (- 0. 153, p< 0. 05) and the years of experience (- 0. 270, p< 0. 01) of respondents showed a significant relationship with the indigenous techniques of processing shea butter. It was concluded that indigenous methods of processing shea butter are widespread among respondents, knowledge is acquired through family members and that they are faced with several challenges.

Crystalline samples prepared with these potentials exhibit normal brittle fracture, with running cracks. Only when subjected to a constantly increasing strain did the crack in the glasses lengthen. Even here, once the strain stopped increasing, the crack tip stopped moving. We examined the stress-strain curve for our model materials, and found that they did not exhibit the saturated stress plateau characteristic of ductile materials.

40|$|Abstract. Nonlinear surface {{acoustic}} wave (SAW) pulses with shocks were used to initiate cracks in brittle materials such as single-crystal silicon, quartz crystals, and fused quartz. The strongly nonlinear elastic surface pulses were excited with pulsed laser radiation and detected with a continuous-wave laser employing the probe beam deflection method. These SAW pulses with finite amplitudes develop steep shock fronts and spikes during propagation with strains in the 10 - 310 - 2 range that break most chemical bonds. The resulting impulsive induction of dynamic fracture occurs without an artificial <b>seed</b> <b>crack.</b> Crack extension along the surface was detected by scanning force microscopy (SFM) and optical microscopy. The penetration of cracks into the solid was studied by the focused ion beam (FIB) technique in silicon and confocal laser microscopy (CLM) in transparent fused and crystalline quartz. In anisotropic crystals the initiation process launches cracks propagating mainly along the weakest cleavage planes of the crystal. In isotropic materials crack evolution depends on the temporal and spatial variation of the stress field. By {{taking into account the}} stress field of the elliptically polarized SAWs and the tendency of the crack tip to maintain pure tensile stress conditions, crack propagation in fused quartz can be explained...|$|R
