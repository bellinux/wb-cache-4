5000|$|Many early LDs {{were not}} {{manufactured}} properly; sometimes a substandard adhesive {{was used to}} sandwich together {{the two sides of}} the disc. The adhesive contained impurities that were able to penetrate the <b>lacquer</b> <b>seal</b> layer and chemically attack the metalized reflective aluminium layer, causing it to oxidize and lose its reflective characteristics. This was a problem that was termed [...] "laser rot" [...] among LD enthusiasts, also called [...] "color flash" [...] internally by LaserDisc-pressing plants. Some forms of laser rot could appear as black spots that looked like mold or burned plastic which cause the disc to skip and the movie to exhibit excessive speckling noise.

40|$|Seasonal {{changes in}} the Persian orange (Citrus sinensis var. Sia-Varaz) {{and the effect of}} canning and storage on the juice were studied. The major factors under {{consideration}} were the physical characteristics: weight, size, volume of juice, colour of peel; and chemical characteristics: free sugars, vitamin C, free amino acids and lipid content. In order to determine the optimum state of maturity of the orange, samples were harvested at regular monthly intervals and analysed. 1. Throughout fruit development there was a continuous increase of juice, fruit size, and total soluble solids while total acidity decreased. These parameters were sufficiently different to enable the separation of the development cycle into three distinct phases: Cell division, Cell enlargement and Maturation of the fruit. Colour break from yellow to orange occurred between December and January but the oranges were assessed to be mature for harvesting by February and March. 2. Five sugars were identified: xylose, galactose, fructose, glucose and sucrose. Xylose soon disappeared while galactose was only found in minor quantities. Sucrose and reducing sugar content increased with fruit development. In the mature orange the ratio of suerose : glueose : fructose was very close to 2 : 1 : 1. 3. While vitamin C content per 100 g pulp showed no significant change over the period of study the amount per orange pulp increased approximately four-fold. 4. Seventeen amino acids were identified. Increase in proline and arginine during December and January may be used as an indication of the onset of maturation. 5. Changes in lipid constituents were noted but, in general, no definite pattern could be established. The processing procedure involved heating the juice at 98 °C for 30 seconds and then <b>sealing</b> in <b>lacquered</b> A 1 cans. Analyses were carried out at two-monthly intervals. 6. Although total free sugars, vitamin C and colour of the juice were not affected by processing, significant increases in total free amino acids and lipids were noted. 7. Storage of canned juice at 7 °C for twelve months showed no significant effect on total free sugars, vitamin C, free amino acids and flavour. However, total lipid was significantly decreased after eight months. Storage of canned juice at 30 °C brought about significant losses of total free sugars after twelve months, of vitamin C after two weeks, and of free amino acids after two months, and of total lipids after two months. The flavour of the juice, judged by a taste panel, had deteriorated significantly after one month's storage. <p...|$|R
40|$|My PhD thesis Changing Social and Cultural Identities in a Border Area. The Case of Pre-Imperial and Early Imperial Sichuan {{discusses}} the funerary {{remains of the}} Sichuan region dated from the Warring States period to the Western Han dynasty (V-I cent. BC.) My research specifically addresses issues of identity, boundaries and social interaction, immediately prior to and during the early incorporation of the region into the empire, {{as well as the}} relevance of these concepts for the interpretation of global trends and local variations identified in the archaeological record. My aims were on the one hand to question the attribution of specific cultural traits to distinct "archaeological cultures", as the local "Ba" and "Shu" cultures", {{and on the other hand}} to detect from the discontinuities of the archaeological record the existence of cross-cutting and overlapping social and cultural identities. The research entails a qualitative and quantitative analysis of a dataset composed of around 300 burials and their grave goods assemblages recorded in Chinese publications and field records. Special attention was given to the use and association of different burial types, specific classes of items (pottery, bronze weapons, bronze vessels, bronze objects, ornaments, <b>seals,</b> iron and <b>lacquer),</b> and distinct decorative motifs on weapons. The patterns identified in the temporal and spatial variability of the selected funerary elements have suggested the existence of a complex social landscape, characterised by various horizontal and vertical differentiations within and between sites, and by the presence and interaction of different social and cultural groups involved in a process of adjustment, negotiation and redefinition of their own identities. This overall picture is opposed to a more classical and culture-historical perspective which tends to explain variability in the region with the existence of different "archaeological cultures".
