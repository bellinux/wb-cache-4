In this work, dynamic measurements are performed {{in order to determine the}} elastic modulus of a <b>shell</b> <b>segment.</b> A test procedure was developed, which excites a <b>shell</b> <b>segment</b> and measures its resonant frequency. This resonant frequency together with the dimensions of the <b>shell</b> <b>segment</b> form the base for the calculation of the dynamic elastic modulus. A formula for the elastic modulus was derived using modal analysis of a <b>shell</b> <b>segment.</b> The elastic modulus of 100 Hisex(R) -layer eggs was measured to validate the technique. For each egg, three shell segments were sawn along the equator. The average value for the modulus of the eggs was 28. 55 GN m(- 2). The variance between the modulus of the eggs was 3. 070 GN m(- 2). These values are in line with the values of the static modulus mentioned by other investigators.

40|$|Fast mixing is {{essential}} for many microfluidic applications, especially for flow at low Reynolds numbers. A capillary tube-in-tube coaxial flow setup in combination with a glass microreactor was used to produce immiscible multiphase segments. These double emulsion segments are composed of an organic solvent as the shell (outer) phase and a completely fluorinated liquid (FluorinertÂ® FC- 40) as the core (inner) phase. Due to the higher density of the core droplets, they are responsive to changing their position to {{the force of gravity}} (g-force). By gently shaking or jiggling the reactor, the core drop flows very fast {{in the direction of the}} g-field without leaving the shell organic phase segment. Furthermore, by shaking or jiggling the reactor, the inner droplet moves along the phase boundary of the <b>shell</b> <b>segment</b> and continuous phase. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations show an enhancement of the internal circulations, i. e., causing an exceptional mixing inside of the <b>shell</b> <b>segment.</b> For reactions which are limited by mass transfer, where the conversion significantly increases with improved mixing, these recirculation zones are decisive because they also accelerate the mixing process. With a common phase-transfer catalytic (PTC) etherification of phenol with dimethyl sulphate, a remarkable increase of yield (85 % gas chromatography [GC]) could be achieved by applying active mixing within a segment in continuous flow...|$|E

40|$|Bolted, <b>segmented</b> {{cylindrical}} <b>shells</b> are {{a common}} structural component in many engineering systems especially for aerospace launch vehicles. <b>Segmented</b> <b>shells</b> are often needed due to limitations of manufacturing capabilities or transportation issues related to very long, large-diameter cylindrical shells. These cylindrical shells typically have a flange or ring welded to opposite ends so that <b>shell</b> <b>segments</b> can be mated together and bolted to form a larger structural system. As the diameter of these shells increases, maintaining strict fabrication tolerances for the flanges to be flat and parallel on a welded structure is an extreme challenge.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, {{concept of a}} {{periodic}} structure is used to study {{the characteristics of the}} natural frequencies of a complete unstiffened cylindrical shell. A segment of the shell between two consecutive nodal points is chosen to be a periodic structural element. The present effort is to modify Mead and Bardell's approach to study the free vibration characteristics of unstiffened cylindrical shell. The Love-Timoshenko formulation for the strain energy is used in conjunction with Hamilton's principle to compute the natural propagation constants for two shell geometries and different circumferential nodal patterns employing Floquet's principle. The natural frequencies were obtained using Sengupta's method and were compared with those obtained from classical Arnold-Warburton's method. The results from the wave propagation method were found to compare identically with the classical methods, since both the methods lead to the exact solution of the same problem. Thus consideration of the <b>shell</b> <b>segment</b> between two consecutive nodal points as a periodic structure is validated.

40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the free vibration of open circular cylindrical shells with intermediate ring supports. An analytical procedure for determining the free vibration frequencies of such shells is developed based on the FlÃ¼gge thin shell theory. An open circular cylindrical shell is assumed to be simply supported along the two straight edges and the remaining two opposite curved edges may have any combinations of support conditions. The shell is divided into multiple segments along the locations of the intermediate ring supports. The state-space technique is employed to derive the exact solutions for each <b>shell</b> <b>segment</b> and the domain decomposition method is applied to enforce the geometric and natural boundary/interface conditions along the interfaces of the shell segments and the curved edges of the shell. Comparison studies are carried out to verify the correctness of the proposed method. Exact vibration frequencies are obtained for open circular cylindrical shells with multiple intermediate ring supports. The influence of the number of intermediate ring supports, the locations of the ring supports, the boundary conditions and the variation of the included angle of the shells on the natural frequencies are examined. The exact vibration solutions can be used as important benchmark values for researchers to check their numerical methods and for engineers to design such shell structures...|$|E
40|$|Classical shell finite {{elements}} usually employ low-order polynomial shape functions to interpolate between nodal displacement and rotational degrees of freedom. Consequently, carefully-designed fine meshes are often required to accurately capture regions of high local curvature, {{such as at}} the âboundary layerâ of bending that occurs in cylindrical shells near a boundary or discontinuity. This significantly increases the computational cost of any analysis. This paper is a âproof of conceptâ illustration of a novel cylindrical axisymmetric shell element that is enriched with rigorously-derived transcendental shape functions to exactly capture the bending boundary layer. When complemented with simple polynomials to express the membrane displacements, a single boundary layer shell element is able to support very complex displacement and stress fields that are exact for distributed element loads of up to second order. A single element is usually sufficient per <b>shell</b> <b>segment</b> in a multi-strake shell. The predictions of the novel element are compared against analytical solutions, a classical axisymmetric shell element with polynomial shape functions and the ABAQUS S 4 R shell element in three problems of increasing complexity and practical relevance.

In a first step, principle investigations were conducted concerning the behaviour of the material at very low temperatures and technical aspects were examined to manufactured large scale structures. In a second step, mechanical and physical characteristics of CFRP, honeycomb-core, adhesives and of other materials were determined as a data base for design of prototypes. In parallel a development philosophy was elaborated and as a consequence it was determined first to conduct cryogenic tests using reduced scale prototypes of different constructions and materials to investigate LH_ 2 -compatibility, thermal stress and insulation performance. Consequently a two- and three layer honey-comb sample was designed and calculated with high bending resistance and the ability to be evacuated. In addition a <b>shell</b> <b>segment</b> was designed with external PUR-insulation of 35 mm thickness. To perform cryogenic tests with LN_ 2 and LH_ 2 a special test equipment was established and the test samples were subject to a test cycle at equal conditons. The aim of the test-cycles was to reach stationary temperature conditions at LN_ 2 and LH_ 2 level and then to simulate a relevant mission profile by heating the outside. The test results corresponded well with analytic data and thus they are a good basis for further development and tests. (orig.)
