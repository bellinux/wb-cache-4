5|$|Emergency lights may be {{housed in}} <b>special</b> <b>fittings,</b> {{such as in}} a lightbar, or may be hidden in a host light (such as a headlamp) by {{drilling}} {{a hole in the}} host light's reflector and inserting the emergency light. These hidden lights may not be apparent until they are activated. Additionally, some of the standard lights fitted to an ambulance (e.g. headlamps, tail lamps) may be programmed to flash. Flashing headlights (typically the high beams, flashed alternately) are known as a wig-wag.|$|E
25|$|The Westbury {{could be}} fitted with {{defensive}} Lewis guns on a Scarff ring position {{on top of}} the fuselage, aft of the COW gun mounting, and in a ventral mount. Its most important gun mountings were in the nose and immediately aft of the wing, and had <b>special</b> <b>fittings</b> for the much larger and heavier COW guns.|$|E
25|$|The basic Bensen Gyrocopter {{design is}} a simple frame of square {{aluminium}} or galvanized steel tubing, reinforced with triangles of lighter tubing. It is arranged so that the stress falls on the tubes, or <b>special</b> <b>fittings,</b> not the bolts. A front-to-back keel mounts a steerable nosewheel, seat, engine, and a vertical stabilizer. Outlying mainwheels are mounted on an axle. Some versions may mount seaplane-style floats for water operations.|$|E

50|$|The {{penetrations}} {{through a}} building envelope must {{be built in}} a way such that water does not enter the building, such as using flashing and <b>special</b> <b>fittings</b> for pipes, vents, wires, etc. Some caulkings are durable, but many are unreliable for waterproofing.|$|E
5000|$|The cruisers {{involved}} in the blockade, including [...] were equipped in Chatham, by over 2,000 workers for the <b>special</b> <b>fitting</b> out and stripping out (in {{the case of the}} ships to be sunk) of unnecessary equipment, including their masts. Iris, Daffodil and the submarines were fitted out in Portsmouth. The fleet made its rendezvous at Swin Deep, about 8 mi south of Clacton. Almost none of the participants were aware of their target.|$|R
50|$|It {{consists}} of two components, a transom and a yard. The transom is the vertical component and is graduated from 0° at the top to 45° at the bottom. At {{the top of the}} transom, a vane is mounted to cast a shadow. The yard is horizontal and is graduated from 45° to 90°. The transom and yard are joined by a <b>special</b> <b>fitting</b> (the double socket in Figure 6) that permits independent adjustments of the transom vertically and the yard horizontally.|$|R
50|$|The {{spinnaker}} pole is rigged {{to run from}} the base of the mast, where there is a <b>special</b> <b>fitting</b> for attaching one end of the pole, out to windward over the side of the boat. There, one of the control lines of whichever sail it is to be used with is run through a fitting on the other end of the {{spinnaker pole}}. This allows for more precise control of the corner of the sail to which the line is attached.|$|R
50|$|Unlike water piping, if it the conduit {{is to be}} watertight, {{the idea}} is to keep water out, not in. In this case, gaskets are used with <b>special</b> <b>fittings,</b> such as the weatherhead leading from the {{overhead}} electrical mains to the electric meter.|$|E
50|$|Crimped or pressed {{connections}} use <b>special</b> <b>fittings</b> {{which are}} permanently attached to tubing with a powered crimper. The fittings, manufactured with a pre-installed sealant, slide over the tubing to be connected. High pressure {{is used to}} deform the fitting and compress the sealant against the inner tubing, creating a leakproof seal.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} ways to build a velomobile. One modern design is [...] "body-on-frame", in which a velomobile is made from a not-faired cycle plus a body. A {{standard}} cycle may be used, but often a custom cycle is used with <b>special</b> <b>fittings</b> to mount the body; the use of <b>special</b> <b>fittings</b> tends to improve fit and durability, and can also reduce weight. Body-on-frame construction allows flexible configuration: the body may be of any construction, as it {{does not need to be}} self-supporting, and various bodies can be used with various frames. Also, the body may be removed so the cycle alone can be used. However, the overall weight of body-on-frame is often higher than alternatives, as the body does have some intrinsic strength, yet this is not used to reduce the weight of the frame.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{many other}} professional-level cameras {{of the early}} 1970s, the F-1 {{required}} no modification or <b>special</b> custom <b>fitting</b> to attach the motor drives, one simply removed the bottom plate and screwed the motor drive in place.|$|R
50|$|Ranger was {{commissioned}} at League Island Naval Shipyard, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 27 November 1876, with Commander H. D. Manley in command. After completion of fitting out, Ranger {{was assigned to}} the Atlantic Station, but remained in the Gosport (Portsmouth) Navy Yard and Hampton Roads until 8 March 1877, when she {{was assigned to the}} Asiatic Fleet. Following a <b>special</b> <b>fitting</b> out for her new duty, Ranger left New York City 21 May 1877, arriving Hong Kong 24 August 1877, via Gibraltar, Suez Canal, and Malacca Straits. The ship served on the Asiatic Station until the fall of 1879, protecting American interests and national policy in the Far East.|$|R
50|$|Thales Introduced the Scorpion Helmet-Mounted Cueing System to the {{military}} aviation market in 2008. Scorpion was {{the winner of the}} Helmet Mounted Integrated Targeting (HMIT) program in 2010. Scorpion has the distinction of being the first color HMD introduced. It was developed for targeting pod, gimbaled sensor or high off-boresight missile cueing mission scenarios. Unlike most HMDs, which require custom helmets, Scorpion was designed to be installed on standard issue HGU-55/P and HGU-68/P helmets and is fully compatible with standard issue U.S. Pilot Flight Equipment without <b>special</b> <b>fitting.</b> It is also fully compatible with standard unmodified AN/AVS-9 Night Vision Goggles (NVG) and Panoramic Night Vision Goggles (PNVG).|$|R

5000|$|Drainage and venting systems require {{not only}} pipe, but also many {{specialized}} fittings which add considerably to their cost of construction. <b>Special</b> access <b>fittings</b> such as [...] "clean-outs" [...] enhance the long-term maintainability of the systems, and {{are required by}} most plumbing codes.|$|R
40|$|The {{experience}} of mathematical structure may {{be supported by}} representing mathematical knowledge graphically {{in the form of}} networks. In this paper, two special graphical representations of mathematical networks, mind maps and concept maps, are presented. Both knowledge maps are means to show ideas and concepts connected with a topic, in a well-structured form. Their <b>special</b> <b>fitting</b> as a pedagogical tool for mathematics education is pointed out, especially with regard to build structure. Possible uses of the presented knowledge maps together with their advantages and limits are discussed and classroom experiences collected from 9 teachers of different schools are presented.
