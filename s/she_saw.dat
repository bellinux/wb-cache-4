6000|$|... 'No. The {{face of a}} dark, remarkable-looking man, in black, {{with black}} hair and a grey {{moustache}} - a handsome man except for a reserved and secret air. Not a face <b>she</b> ever <b>saw,</b> or at all like a face <b>she</b> ever <b>saw.</b> Doing nothing in the dream but looking at her fixedly, out of darkness.' ...|$|R
5|$|Four {{members of}} the same family were killed in Alkozai. According to a 16-year-old boy who was shot in the leg, Bales woke up his family members before {{shooting}} them. Another witness said <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> the man drag a woman out of her house and repeatedly hit her head against a wall.|$|E
5|$|Girls had equal {{inheritance}} {{rights with}} boys if their father died without leaving a will. A Roman mother's {{right to own}} property and to dispose of it as <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> fit, including setting the terms of her own will, gave her enormous influence over her sons even when they were adults.|$|E
5|$|Piemonte was {{a unique}} {{protected}} cruiser built for the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in the 1880s by the British shipyard Armstrong Whitworth. She {{was the first major}} warship armed entirely with quick-firing (QF) guns and she was also the fastest cruiser in the world upon her completion in 1889. Piemonte was frequently deployed overseas, including a lengthy tour in East Asian waters from 1901 to 1904. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> significant action during the Italo-Turkish War in 191112 in the Red Sea, where she frequently bombarded Ottoman ports. During the Battle of Kunfuda Bay in January 1912, she and two destroyers sank four Ottoman gunboats and forced ashore three more. Piemonte participated in World War I but <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> little action during the conflict. She remained in service until 1920, when she was scrapped.|$|E

5|$|Rodham's {{mother wanted}} her to have an independent, {{professional}} career, and her father, who was otherwise a traditionalist, felt that his daughter's abilities and opportunities should not be limited by gender. Raised in a politically conservative household, Rodham helped canvass Chicago's South Side at age 13 following the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election, where <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> evidence of electoral fraud (such as voting list entries showing addresses that were empty lots) against Republican candidate Richard Nixon. She then volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the U.S. presidential election of 1964. Rodham's early political development was shaped most by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative and by her Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> and afterwards briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. at a 1962 speech in Chicago's Orchestra Hall.|$|E
5|$|The German-built {{seaplane}} tender Zmaj {{was commissioned}} into the KJRM in 1930, but was {{converted to a}} minelayer in 1937. Captured by the Germans in April 1941, <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> service in the seaplane tender, aircraft rescue and troop transport roles as Drache. In late 1942, she was re-commissioned as a minelayer, and was used for shipboard trials with helicopters in 1943 before being sunk in September 1944.|$|E
5|$|The future Lord Nelson {{served as}} Agamemnons captain from January 1793 for 3 years and 3 months, {{during which time}} <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> {{considerable}} service in the Mediterranean. After Nelson's departure, {{she was involved in}} the infamous 1797 mutinies at Spithead and the Nore, and in 1801 was present at the first Battle of Copenhagen, but ran aground before being able to enter the action.|$|E
60|$|During {{the ball}} she looked {{everywhere}} for the gardener's boy, but <b>she</b> never <b>saw</b> him.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> {{suddenly}} <b>saw</b> the foot-board {{of the bed}} as the foot-stone of {{the grave}} of love.|$|R

5|$|The gunboat and royal yacht Beli Orao {{came into}} service in 1939 and was {{captured}} by the Italians in April 1941 during the invasion. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> service with the Italians as Alba then Zagabria before being returned to the KJRM-in-exile in late 1943. She survived the war and {{was transferred to the}} new Yugoslav Navy.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{commissioning}} on 25 August 1917, Nairana {{was assigned}} to the Battle Cruiser Force of the Grand Fleet at Scapa Flow, carrying four Short Type 184 floatplanes and four Beardmore W.B.III aircraft. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> little operational use as she was employed for pilot training and ferrying aircraft to ships equipped with flying-off decks.|$|E
5|$|A Miss Williams {{from nearby}} Borley Lodge said <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> {{the figure of}} the ghostly nun in the upstairs window and, {{according}} to Harry Price, demanded a fee of one guinea for her story. In August 1943, Price conducted a brief dig in the cellars of the ruined house and discovered two bones thought to be of a young woman. The bones were given a Christian burial in Liston churchyard, after the parish of Borley refused to allow the ceremony to take place on account of the local opinion that the bones found were those of a pig.|$|E

5|$|After {{crossing}} a bridge, {{they reached the}} gardens {{in front of the}} palace, and Moberly noticed a lady sketching on the grass who looked at them. She later described what <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> in great detail: the lady was wearing a light summer dress, on her head was a shady white hat, and she had lots of fair hair. Moberly thought she was a tourist at first, but the dress appeared to be old-fashioned. Moberly came to believe that the lady was Marie Antoinette. Jourdain, however, did not see the lady.|$|E

She was present during the unsuccessful first incursion into the Gulf of Riga in August 1915, though <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> no combat during the operation.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with many}} others in the Labour movement, Wilkinson's attitudes were radicalised by the Russian Revolution of 1917. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> {{communism}} as {{the shape of the}} future, and when the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) was formed in the summer of 1920, Wilkinson was {{one of a group of}} ILP members with Marxist leanings who became founder members. For the next few years the CPGB was the main focus of her political activity, although she kept her membership in the Labour Party, which at the time accepted dual CPGB/Labour memberships.|$|E

5|$|Asar-i Tevfik {{served in}} the Ottoman fleet {{for more than four}} decades. During this period, <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> action in two major wars, the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78 and the First Balkan War in 1913. During the first conflict, she was torpedoed by a Russian torpedo boat but was only {{slightly}} damaged. She took part in the abortive Battle of Elli against the Greek Navy in December 1912 during the First Balkan War. While operating against Bulgarian positions in February 1913, she ran aground; Bulgarian field artillery then shelled the ship. The damage they inflicted, coupled with heavy seas, destroyed the ship.|$|E
5|$|Bolzano had {{a fairly}} uneventful peacetime career, which {{primarily}} consisted of naval reviews for Italian and foreign dignitaries. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> extensive {{action in the}} first three years of Italy's participation in World War II. She took part in the Battles of Calabria, Taranto, Cape Spartivento, and Cape Matapan. The ship was lightly damaged at Calabria, but she emerged from the other engagements unscathed. She also frequently escorted convoys to North Africa in 1941 and 1942 and patrolled for British naval forces in the central Mediterranean Sea.|$|E

Rendra, which convinced her to drop out of university and join the troupe. In 1974 she founded Satu Merah Panggung Theater, which performed adaptations of foreign works such as the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam and William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and Hamlet– in the latter, Sarumpaet played the titular role.|$|E
