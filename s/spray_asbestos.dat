40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 38 - 44) A modern sixteen-story {{office building}} was surveyed {{to determine if}} erosion of <b>spray</b> <b>asbestos</b> fibres from the cementitious surface of the air plenum chambers was contaminating the building air supply system, subjecting the occupants to a potential hazard. The NIOSH approved method of collection and analysis was utilized. This consisted of collecting the fibres on a membrane filter, dissolving the filter on a glass slide, and then counting the fibres utilizing phase microscopy. Fibre concentrations {{were found to be}} extremely low and most probably reflect the general ambient level in the urban environment, as two nearby buildings that did not incorporate asbestos-based building materials had comparable levels. These extremely low levels {{do not appear to be}} biologically significant...|$|E
25|$|The baths were {{improved}} {{again in}} 1948 with {{the installation of}} underwater lighting, improved lighting in the bath hall {{and the application of}} <b>sprayed</b> <b>asbestos</b> acoustic treatment to the bath hall ceiling.|$|R
50|$|They {{introduced}} {{some new}} features; the first standard multiple units with disc brakes (emergency stop from top speed in 33 seconds over 800 yd); the first naturally air-cooled rectifiers (silicon diodes on cups of beryllium oxide), inductors and transformers. Noise was reduced by <b>sprayed</b> <b>asbestos</b> on the floor, body and roof.|$|R

50|$|The British Rail Class 109 is a {{class of}} 2-car diesel {{multiple}} units built in 1957 by D Wickham & Co. Five two-car units were built featuring an unusual body design. The design, first used in 1936 for South American railways, aimed to minimise weight. It had no underframe, but the whole body was formed into a welded stress-bearing box girder made of 1/8 in solid drawn steel tube. Aluminium was used for panels, luggage racks, window frames, vacuum pipes and fuel and vacuum tanks. The corrugated steel floor was filled with <b>sprayed</b> <b>asbestos</b> and covered with asbestos-filled flame-proofed hardboard and rubber sheet.|$|R
40|$|Dumps are {{potential}} emittents for very different particulates. The atmospheric environment of dumps can be also contaminated by release of carcinogenic <b>asbestos</b> fibers, because <b>sprayed</b> <b>asbestos,</b> asbestos cement refuse from sanitation and demolition of buildings is very often storaged here. Ambient air concentrations of asbestos fibers {{as high as}} 10. 000 to 40. 000 fibers (longer than 5 mym) /cubic meter were measured on three garbage dumps and building refuse dumps during our investigations. The concentrations of other mineral fibers in ambient air of these garbage dumps were high too; up to 30. 000 fibers (longer than 5 mym) /cubic meter. Also ambient air {{in the vicinity of}} such dumps is contaminated by asbestos fibers at a level of about 1000 fibers asbestos fibers (longer than 5 mym) /cubic meter. These concentrations can be reached especially during inversion situations and low wind velocities. For ambient air asbestos fiber concentrations of 1000 fibers (longer than 5 mym) /cbm the healt h risk for the general population could be estimated as high as of about 10 E- 4 (one more carcinogenic case for 10. 000 inhabitants). The other ambient air carcinogens increase by their synergistic effect to this value too. Control methods for sanitation of dumps containing asbestos wastes have to be developed and their efficiency has to be proved by measuring asbestos fiber emission and ambient air concentrations.

50|$|One of {{the methods}} of working {{employed}} at Craven's was shooting a wet slurry of asbestos from a pressure gun. The operators would stand under a railway car supported on large trestles and <b>spray</b> the <b>asbestos</b> slurry in a 2 in layer onto {{the underside of the}} railway car. This was done to provide sound insulation {{to the floor of the}} railway car prior to final assembly.|$|R
50|$|Body framing was {{extruded}} and riveted together. Panelling was welded into continuous {{sheets and}} riveted to the frame. Luggage racks were light alloy. The floors had 2 layers of flameproof hardboard, covered with linoleum. To reduce noise and condensation, the inside structure and undersides were <b>sprayed</b> with <b>asbestos.</b> Lighting was by 60-watt, 24-volt lamps charged by belt driven dynamos. Heating was oil fired. Standard mild steel bogies ran on Timken roller bearings.|$|R
25|$|In April 1970, the New York City Department of Air Resources ordered {{contractors}} {{building the}} World Trade Center {{to stop the}} <b>spraying</b> of <b>asbestos</b> as an insulating material. Fireproofing was incorporated in the original construction and more was added after a fire in 1975 that spread to six floors before being extinguished. After the 1993 bombing, inspections found fireproofing to be deficient. The Port Authority {{was in the process}} of replacing it, but replacement had been completed on only 18floors in 1WTC, including all the floors affected by the aircraft impact and fires, and on 13floors in 2WTC, although only three of these floors (77, 78, and 85) were directly affected by the aircraft impact.|$|R
50|$|In 1975 an inquest {{into the}} death of former railway work Frank Summers {{recorded}} that he had died from an industrial disease; he had previous been employed in <b>asbestos</b> <b>spraying</b> at York Carriage works. At the inquest it was claimed {{that the use of}} asbestos at the works ended in 1964; initially the dangers of asbestos were not known and employees worked without facemasks or other protection; workers continued to be exposed to asbestos into the 1970s, relatives of workers also developed asbestos related diseases through contact with dust on workers clothing.|$|R
2500|$|J.W.Roberts Ltd. {{was founded}} in Armley in 1874 as a textile producer, {{primarily}} working with cotton, hemp and jute. By 1906, its factory on Canal Road, known as the Midland Works, specialised {{in the manufacture of}} asbestos insulation mattresses for steam locomotive boilers and {{is believed to have been}} one of only two factories in the world at the time which processed blue asbestos. In 1920 it merged with Turner Brothers Asbestos Company Ltd., Newalls Insulation Company Ltd., and the Washington Chemical Company Ltd., to form Turner & Newall Ltd., which in 1925 became a public company. T's rapid growth has been attributed to a product called [...] "Sprayed Limpet Asbestos", developed in the Armley works in 1931. This was made by mixing raw asbestos with water and cement, the resulting slurry being spray applicated on to the surface to be insulated, creating a cheap sound- and fireproof coating. <b>Sprayed</b> Limpet <b>Asbestos</b> generated huge profits for T who exported the product to 60 countries where it was applied to a wide range of buildings including schools, churches and theatres and also the London Underground. The factory at Armley closed in 1959.|$|R
50|$|A February 1976 {{regulation}} on {{accidents in}} nuclear installations provided for interministerial coordination on measures {{to be taken}} “in the event of accidents and for the preparation of an emergency plan,” while a law of June 1976 provided for special measures for unemployed persons who {{reached the age of}} 60 and who had used up their rights to unemployment benefit. A law of December 1976 relaxed the conditions for exemption from national insurance contributions or entitlement to ·pay reduced contributions, and also extended entitlement to orphans' pensions “to illegitimate children whose mothers are dead and who have not been recognized by their fathers.” The Asbestos Decree of April 1977 prohibited the storage and use of crocidolite (blue asbestos) and materials or ·products containing crocidolite and also prohibited “ the <b>spraying</b> of <b>asbestos</b> or materials or products containing asbestos and their use for thermal insulation or for acoustic, preservative or decorative purposes.” In September 1977, regulations were issued “regarding the conditions under which young persons of 16 and over may exceptionally drive agricultural tractors.” In May 1977, a subsidy scheme for the placing of handicapped persons was introduced.|$|R

2500|$|In 1987 Chase Manhattan Bank (Chase) began legal {{proceedings}} against T ("Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A., Plaintiff-appellee, v. Turner & Newall, Plc, Formerly Known As Turner & Newall Ltd., Defendant-third-party-plaintiff-appellant, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, Turner Construction Company, third-party-defendants") in the United States. Chase [...] claimed compensatory and punitive damages from T {{for the hazard}} created at Chase's corporate headquarters {{by the presence of}} <b>spray</b> applicated <b>asbestos</b> fireproofing materials. In the United Kingdom, John Battle had complained to Parliament that securing documents from T was causing progress with the Armley victims' cases to stall, with [...] "documents shifted around from one subsidiary to another within the parent group. Lawyers are expected to specify exactly what records they want without knowing what the company holds. Even if they manage to specify particular records, such as reports on the escape of dust from the factory and tested measurements of asbestos levels within the factory or in the surrounding area - even details of the factory's structure and its ventilation system - those documents are either outwith the rules of discovery or the reply comes back that the records no longer exist." [...] But as the Chase case progressed, around two million T documents, many of which had previously been unseen by British solicitors and historians, were uncovered by the discovery process and research in the US.|$|R
