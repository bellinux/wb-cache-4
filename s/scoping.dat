When she did not return home her husband went to the mall and found her car, a 1985 Ford Tempo, with the tires slashed. It is believed that Chandler, after <b>scoping</b> out the victim {{over a couple of}} days, slashed the tires and showed up {{in the guise of a}} good samaritan and offered to help. Three hours after she was reported missing, her body was found under a residential mailbox, in a local neighborhood, by two men returning from a fishing trip.|$|E
5|$|The Environmental Assessment <b>Scoping</b> Report for the {{proposed}} station was submitted to the Department of Trade and Industry in 2007, and the application for the development was {{to be made to}} the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform once the Environmental Impact Assessment was completed. A contract had already been signed with the Shaw Group to design and engineer the station. If Npower had been granted permission to build the new station, construction work would have begun in 2010, and the station was expected to be fully commissioned by 2014. It would {{have been one of the}} most efficient coal-fired power stations of its size in the UK.|$|E
50|$|In C, <b>scope</b> is {{traditionally}} known as linkage or visibility, particularly for variables. C is a lexically <b>scoped</b> language with global <b>scope</b> (known as external linkage), {{a form of}} module <b>scope</b> or file <b>scope</b> (known as internal linkage), and local <b>scope</b> (within a function); within a function <b>scopes</b> can further be nested via block <b>scope.</b> However, standard C does not support nested functions.|$|R

25|$|The {{impetus to}} {{incorporate}} lexical <b>scoping,</b> {{which was an}} unusual <b>scoping</b> model in the early 1970s, into their new version of Lisp, came from Sussman's studies of ALGOL. He suggested that ALGOL-like lexical <b>scoping</b> mechanisms would help to realize their initial goal of implementing Hewitt's Actor model in Lisp.|$|E
25|$|The Lisp family splits {{over the}} use of dynamic or static (a.k.a. lexical) scope. Clojure, Common Lisp and Scheme make use of static <b>scoping</b> by default, while newLISP, Picolisp and the {{embedded}} languages in Emacs and AutoCAD use dynamic <b>scoping.</b> Since version 24.1, Emacs uses both dynamic and lexical <b>scoping.</b>|$|E
25|$|JavaScript {{supports}} {{much of the}} {{structured programming}} syntax from C (e.g., if statements, while loops, switch statements, do while loops, etc.). One partial exception is scoping: JavaScript originally had only function <b>scoping</b> with var. ECMAScript 2015 added keywords let and const for block <b>scoping,</b> meaning JavaScript now has both function and block <b>scoping.</b> Like C, JavaScript makes a distinction between expressions and statements. One syntactic difference from C is automatic semicolon insertion, which allows the semicolons that would normally terminate statements to be omitted.|$|E

40|$|Software project <b>scope</b> {{verification}} is a {{very important}} process in project <b>scope</b> management {{and it needs to be}} performed properly and thoroughly so as to avoid project rework and <b>scope</b> creep. Moreover, software <b>scope</b> verification is crucial in the process of delivering exactly what the customer requested and minimizing project <b>scope</b> changes. Well defined software <b>scope</b> eases the process of <b>scope</b> verification and contributes to project success. Furthermore, a deliverable-oriented WBS provides a road map to a well defined software <b>scope</b> of work.

Healthcare professionals were more satisfied with the third-generation single-use Ambu® aScope™.|$|R
50|$|Another very {{important}} concept within {{this method is}} <b>scope</b> management. The <b>scope</b> needs to be managed throughout the project to prevent <b>scope</b> creeping which results in delays. The <b>scope</b> will be determined early and changes to the <b>scope</b> (like adding additional features which were at first considered beyond the <b>scope</b> of the project) will be evaluated and either accepted or rejected. Changes in the <b>scope</b> can be made but this will always be affected by trade offs between features, resources and time.|$|R

Common Lisp has a large language standard including many built-in data types, functions, macros and other language elements, as well as an object system (Common Lisp Object System). Common Lisp also borrowed certain features from Scheme such as lexical <b>scoping</b> and lexical closures.|$|E
