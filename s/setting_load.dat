The paper analyzes the interaction relationship between support <b>setting</b> <b>load</b> and surrounding rock by means of theory and experimental data. It is proved that <b>setting</b> <b>load</b> has an important influence on inhibiting immediate roof caving and enhancing immediate roof strength. The increment of <b>setting</b> <b>load</b> can prevent immediate roof falling. <b>Setting</b> <b>load</b> can affect the supporting body stiffness and distribution range of augmented resistance. The lower of the <b>setting</b> <b>load,</b> the larger of the roof deflection. The paper puts forward calculation method and influencing factors of coal wall stability ratio. According to the pressure date comparison of Tiebei mine two coal faces, <b>setting</b> <b>load</b> is one of important factors inducing roof large area weighting...|$|E

The surrounding rock experience deformation, destruction, caving and stability under the coupled action of mining stress field and supporting stress field (Gao and He 2010; Ju et al. 2012). Based on the independently researched and developed longwall mining working face supporting quality monitoring system, we identify the six controllable parameters of hydraulic support to surrounding rock through many field observations of hydraulic support and surrounding rock. These factors include the hydraulic support <b>setting</b> <b>load</b> and working resistance, the top beam action point of resultant force, the horizontal applied force from the top beam to roof rock, the face guarding moment, the distance from beam to rib, and working face mining rate. We optimize the six parameters to control the surrounding rock stability.|$|E

The results shows that: with high impact resistant capability, the ZF 15000 / 28 / 52 hydraulic support is influenced slightly by face pressure; with high stability and reliability, the safety valve of the ZF 15000 / 28 / 52 hydraulic support can {{be capable of}} opening timely when resistance exceeds Rated resistance; with high high-usage, the support runs reasonably {{and have a good}} adaptability to the roof.

40|$|Three {{independent}} scientific {{lines of}} evidence were {{sought to determine}} the nutrient load limits to safeguard the macrophyte community of an intermittently closed and open lake/lagoon (ICOLL) : (1) a literature review identified nitrogen load thresholds related {{to the collapse of}} macrophytes in similar systems in Australia, Europe and elsewhere, (2) an ICOLL expert carried out an assessment based on current local data and on data from 57 Australian coastal lakes and lagoons, and (3) a deterministic coupled hydrodynamic-ecological model was developed and applied to simulate the ecological outcomes of several nutrient loading scenarios. The three lines of evidence converged on well-defined nitrogen load estimates required to avoid the collapse of the macrophyte community. Uncertainties were slightly greater in relation to required phosphorus load limits, but the evidence still helped set a precautionary phosphorus load limit that accounted for these uncertainties. Thus, despite the challenges in <b>setting</b> <b>load</b> limits for complex ecosystems, multiple lines of evidence helped derive robust nutrient load limits for managing the ICOLL to safeguard values associated with a healthy macrophyte community.

Based on this condition, Shandong Xin Mei machinery Co, Ltd. has developed {{hydraulic support}} with hanging chain and splicing beam which was suitable to existing features of shallow seams. The support had advantages with flexible connection between supports {{to ensure that all}} pillars reached rated <b>setting</b> <b>load,</b> sub-size top beam to resolve "protection " and "cutting " dilemma for the roof, adjusting and locking support, etc. The company also has given concrete support parameters.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{based on}} field {{observations}} and theoretical analysis, {{we discussed the}} ground pressure behavior law and its characteristic at fully-mechanized face and the material roadway of 10 # seam in Fenxi-Shuguang coal mine. The analysis results indicates that ground pressure at material roadway increased sharply when the working face advanced to place 40 ∼ 50 m away from it, and as the advance of the working face, the deformation of the two-sides is clearly bigger than that at the roof and floor in material roadway; Therefore, support in material roadway should be strengthened to ensure the safe mining of working face. We use the ZDYJ-IIA type computer-round figure apparatus to observe the ground pressure of the fully-mechanized face, which can help us analyze {{the relation of the}} fully-mechanized mining technique with ground pressure as the advance of the working face, as well as obtain the ground pressure behavior law of fully-mechanized face and calculate pace length of the periodical roof pressure. Analysis on the real-time monitoring results of the <b>setting</b> <b>load</b> and the work resistance show that the hydraulic powered supports used at the working face can fulfill the needs of the working face pressure. Finally, we can obtain the conclusion that the method of the ground pressure observation is scientific and feasible, which includes the real-time monitoring on the fully-mechanized face and placing the observation stations in the material roadway to observe the deformation of material roadway...|$|E

Chock leg pressures and leg closures were regularly monitored {{at different stages of}} extraction of longwall panel. During extraction of the panel, maximum leg closure and pressure on the chock shield were 600 mm and 490 bar, respectively (not on all chocks). Setting and yielding pressures were 300 bar and 400 bar corresponding to <b>setting</b> <b>load</b> and yielding load 600 T and 800 T, respectively. During major fall condition, 27 % of chock shields were loaded upto 800 T. During normal periods, maximum load was about 640 T.

At each depth, a fall in vertical stress was found between 80 m to 100 m face advance indicating major roof falland for 250 m depth cover, it was varying from 6 MPa to 4. 5 MPa.

A number of recent studies have reported high heritability of <b>set</b> point viral <b>load</b> implying that viral genetic factors contribute substantially to the overall variation in viral load. The high heritability is surprising given the diversity of host factors associated with controlling viral infection. Here we develop an analytical model that describes the temporal changes {{of the distribution of}} <b>set</b> point viral <b>load</b> as a function of heri-tability.
