40|$|A {{localized}} defect mode in a photonic-layered <b>structure</b> develops <b>nodal</b> <b>points.</b> Placing a thin metallic layer {{at such a}} <b>nodal</b> <b>point</b> {{results in}} the phenomenon of induced transparency. We demonstrate that if this <b>nodal</b> <b>point</b> is not a point of symmetry, then even a tiny alteration of the permittivity {{in the vicinity of}} the defect suppresses the localized mode along with the resonant transmission; the layered structure becomes highly reflective within a broad frequency range. Applications of this hypersensitive transport for optical limiting and switching are discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{transition}} from order to chaos for the Bohmian trajectories of a simple quantum system corresponding to the superposition of three stationary states in a 2 D harmonic well with incommensurable frequencies. We study in particular the role of <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> in the transition to chaos. Our main findings are: a) A proof {{of the existence of}} bounded domains in configuration space which are devoid of <b>nodal</b> <b>points,</b> b) An analytical construction of formal series representing regular orbits in the central domain as well as a numerical investigation of its limits of applicability. c) A detailed exploration of the phase-space <b>structure</b> near the <b>nodal</b> <b>point.</b> In this exploration we use an adiabatic approximation and we draw the flow chart in a moving frame of reference centered at the <b>nodal</b> <b>point.</b> We demonstrate the existence of a saddle point (called X-point) {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>nodal</b> <b>point</b> which plays a key role in the manifestation of exponential sensitivity of the orbits. One of the invariant manifolds of the X-point continues as a spiral terminating at the <b>nodal</b> <b>point.</b> We find cases of Hopf bifurcation at the <b>nodal</b> <b>point</b> and explore the associated phase space <b>structure</b> of the <b>nodal</b> <b>point</b> - X-point complex. We finally demonstrate the mechanism by which this complex generates chaos. Numerical examples of this mechanism are given for particular chaotic orbits, and a comparison is made with previous related works in the literature.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the role}} of Port Authorities as cluster managers able to generate resources for investments with benefits for the intermodal transport chain as a whole. Assessment is made of Port Authority initiatives to foster the development of intermodality {{and the creation of}} dry ports. The framework proposed is then applied to the case of the Ligurian ports, which compete less as individual <b>structures</b> than as <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> within integrated logistic chains. We argue that the integration of the land logistic interface may prove beneficial to the Ligurian ports, and that this can be achieved only if the Port Authorities act as cluster managers...|$|R
40|$|The {{general theory}} of motion in the {{vicinity}} of a moving quantum <b>nodal</b> <b>point</b> (vortex) is studied in the framework of the de Broglie - Bohm trajectory method of quantum mechanics. Using an adiabatic approximation, we find that near any <b>nodal</b> <b>point</b> of an arbitrary wavefunction ψ there is an unstable point (called X-point) in a frame of reference moving with the <b>nodal</b> <b>point.</b> We find general formulae for the <b>nodal</b> <b>point</b> - X-point complex as well as necessary and sufficient conditions of validity of the adiabatic approximation. Chaos emerges from the consecutive scattering events of the orbits with <b>nodal</b> <b>point</b> - X-point complexes. A theoretical model is constructed yielding the local value of the Lyapunov characteristic number in a scattering event, which scales as an inverse power of the speed of the <b>nodal</b> <b>point</b> in the rest frame, or proportionally {{to the size of the}} <b>nodal</b> <b>point</b> X- point complex. The results of detailed numerical experiments with different wavefunctions possessing multiple moving <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> are reported. The statistics of the Lyapunov characteristic numbers of the orbits are found and compared to the number of encounter events of each orbit with the <b>nodal</b> <b>point</b> X-point complexes. Various phenomena appearing at first as counter-intuitive find a straightforward explanation. Comment: accepted to Physical Review...|$|R

40|$|We {{show that}} topological <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> can emerge in {{photonic}} crystal possessing mirror symmetry. The mechanism of generating topological <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> {{is discussed in}} a two-dimensional photonic square lattice, in which four topological <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> split out naturally after the touching of two bands with different parity. The emergence of such <b>nodal</b> <b>points,</b> characterized by vortex structure in momentum space, is attributed to the unavoidable band crossing protected by mirror symmetry. The topological nodes can be unbuckled through breaking the mirror symmetry and a photonic Chern insulator can be achieved through time reversal symmetry breaking. The joint effect of breaking time reversal symmetry and breaking inversion symmetry is further found to strengthen the finite size effect, providing ways to engineer helical edge states...|$|R
50|$|The {{front and}} rear <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> have the {{property}} that a ray aimed at {{one of them will}} be refracted by the lens such that it appears to have come from the other, and with the same angle with respect to the optical axis. The <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> therefore do for angles what the principal planes do for transverse distance. If the medium {{on both sides of the}} optical system is the same (e.g., air), then the {{front and rear}} <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> coincide with the front and rear principal points, respectively.|$|R
40|$|We generalize {{the concept}} of triply-degenerate <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> to non-collinear antiferromagnets. Here, we {{introduce}} this concept to insulating quantum antiferromagnets on the decorated honeycomb lattice, with spin-$ 1 $ bosonic quasiparticle excitations known as magnons. We demonstrate the existence of magnonic surface states with constant energy contours that form pairs of magnonic arcs connecting the surface projection of the magnonic triple <b>nodal</b> <b>points.</b> The quasiparticle excitations near the triple <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> represent three-component bosons beyond that of magnonic Dirac, Weyl, and nodal-line cases. They {{can be regarded as}} a direct reflection of the intrinsic spin carried by magnons. Furthermore, we show that the magnonic triple <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> can split into magnonic Weyl points, as the system transits from a non-collinear spin structure to a noncoplanar one with a nonzero scalar spin chirality. Our results not only apply to insulating antiferromagnets, but also provide a platform to seek for triple <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> in metallic antiferromagnets.

40|$|Streamlines and {{distributions}} of <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> {{are used as}} signatures of chaos in coherent electron transport through three types of billiards, Sinai, Bunimovich and rectangular. Numerical averaged distribution functions of nearest distances between <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> are presented. We find the same form for the Sinai and Bunimovich billiards and {{suggest that there is}} a universal form that {{can be used as a}} signature of quantum chaos for electron transport in open billiards. The universal distribution function is found to be insensitive to the way avaraging is performed (over positions of leads, over an energy interval with a few conductance fluctuations, or both). The integrable rectangular billiard, on the other hand, displays nonuniversal distribution with a central peak related to partial order of <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> for the case of symmetric attachment of leads. However cases with nonsymmetric leads tend to the universal form. Also it is shown how <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> in rectangular billiard can lead to "channeling of quantum flows" while disorder in <b>nodal</b> <b>points</b> in the Sinai billiard gives rise to unstable irregular behavior of the flow.
