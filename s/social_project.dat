He was {{actively}} involved with Kids United, a football team for children with disabilities. Although he did not win on either occasion, his charity still benefited when the 2015 winner, Jeroen Zoet, shared the prize money {{with the other two}} nominees. In late July 2015, English club Birmingham City made a bid for Kieftenbeld's services that triggered the release clause in his contract. Although Groningen accepted they could not stop him leaving, they were disappointed not just at losing their captain so soon {{before the start of the}} new season, but at losing a player who did so much for the club in the community.|$|E

The film received a limited theatrical run in North America, garnering an overall mixed response; A.V. Club described the production as a [...] "proud retreat back into the sandbox of sexual juvenilia" [...] and a [...] "potty-mouthed manifesto from an elder statesman of shock", while positively pointing out that both Blair and Ullman [...] "throw themselves headfirst into the insanity, reveling in the forfeiture of dignity, self-respect, and self-consciousness their roles demand".

2500|$|Deportivo Italia {{changed their}} name to [...] "Deportivo Petare" [...] {{in the summer}} of 2010 {{as a result of an}} {{alliance}} with the Sucre Municipality in the Mranda state and private entrepreneurs, turning into a <b>social</b> <b>project</b> based in Petare looking to bring opportunities for the community's youth to develop into professional footballers. The rebranded club also hoped to appeal to Petare's residents given that the club's attendance numbers were among the worst of the league, in spite of its performances. There is an ongoing dispute because of the strong opposition from the Italian community in Caracas. Five years later, with the arrival of a new Board and still wishing to link the Petare community to the club, the club changed its name again, dropping the word [...] "Deportivo".|$|E

50|$|<b>Social</b> <b>project</b> {{management}} is a non-traditional way of organizing projects and performing project management. It is, in its simplest form, {{the outcome of}} the application of the social networking (i.e. Facebook) paradigm to the context of project ecosystems, as a continued response to the movement toward distributed, virtual teams. Distributed virtual teams lose significant communication value normally present when groups are collocated. Because of this, <b>social</b> <b>project</b> {{management is}} motivated by a philosophy of the maximizing of open, and continuous communication, {{both inside and outside the}} team. Because it is a response to new organizing structures that require technologically mediated communications, <b>Social</b> <b>Project</b> Management is most often enabled by the use of Collaborative software inspired by social media (i.e. Ongozah). This paradigm enables the project work to be published as activity stream and publicized via the integration with the social network of an organization. <b>Social</b> <b>project</b> management embraces both the historical best practices of Project management, and the open collaboration of Web 2.0.|$|E
