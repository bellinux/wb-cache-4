25|$|I needed good victims. Recent news {{had offered}} an {{excellent}} group, the Baha'is, {{who had been}} horribly persecuted in Iran. The more I researched them, the more convinced I became that they would make excellent space colonists. My primary reference was an aged primer on the Baha'i Faith by J. E. Esselmont. I did receive some comments from several Baha'is suggesting that I'd portrayed them as too pacifistic, however, I'll <b>stick</b> <b>by</b> my guns on this. My characters, while they believe in public defense, even armies, to preserve peace, are stubborn in living by a passage I found in Esselmont's book in which Baha'u'llah forbids the Baha'is from taking up arms {{in the defense of}} the faith. The story is carefully crafted to back them into this corner. Our hero is faced with a loss of his faith, which enables him to take action to save his people, but leaves him in a spiritual dilemma.|$|E

[...] Lipa confessed in an interview with NPR that [...] "hey're not necessarily rules I've been able to <b>stick</b> <b>by.</b> But [...] rules that I feel like it's important to be able to tell yourself, to tell your friends... There's a reason people break up, and it's probably the same reason why you shouldn't get back together." [...] Warren explained through an annotation on website Genius that the track was a self-reminder for people recovering from a break-up to not succumb to a momentary temptation since it is not [...] "a good idea in the long term".|$|E
