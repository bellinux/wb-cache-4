Hides (known as blinds in North America) or observation towers are often used to conceal the observers from birds, and/or to improve viewing conditions.

5000|$|Digiscoping is a {{neologism}} for {{the activity}} of using a digital camera to record distant images by coupling it with an optical telescope. The term usually refers to using either a digital single-lens reflex camera with lens attached or, more often, a fixed lens point and shoot digital camera to obtain photos through the eyepiece of a birdwatcher's <b>spotting</b> <b>scope</b> using a technique called afocal photography. It has also been associated with using a digital camera and <b>spotting</b> <b>scope</b> equipped for prime focus photography. The word [...] "digiscoping" [...] was coined in 1999 by French birdwatcher Alain Fossé. Less notable neologisms for this activity are digiscope birding, digiscopy birding, digi-birding, digibinning (using digital camera with binoculars), and phonescoping (using a digital camera phone with a <b>spotting</b> <b>scope</b> or binoculars).|$|E
