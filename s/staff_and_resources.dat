5|$|The {{administration}} of the Clinton Laboratories passed from Monsanto to the University of Chicago in May 1947, and then to Union Carbide in December 1947. The Atomic Energy Commission's influential General Advisory Committee, chaired by J. Robert Oppenheimer, recommended that all work on reactors be concentrated at the Argonne National Laboratory, the successor to the Metallurgical Laboratory, near Chicago. There was also competition for <b>staff</b> <b>and</b> <b>resources</b> from the newly established Brookhaven National Laboratory near New York. Morale was low, {{and no one could}} be found to take on the job of Director of Research at the laboratory, renamed the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in January 1948. At least six people turned down the job before Union Carbide's acting Director, Nelson (Bunny) Rucker, asked Weinberg to become Director of Research in March 1948.|$|E

25|$|Again, {{employer}} adaptations {{undercut the}} effectiveness of the corporate campaign. Additionally, labor unions found it less expensive to build community coalitions, and relied more heavily on staff-driven corporate campaigns. Many union activists also argued that the publicity generated by a rowdy shareholder meeting, for example, or an embarrassing report about conflict of interest on a board of directors, supplanted the community campaign by building the necessary community pressure. These arguments proved incorrect. But declining union fortunes (literally) made it difficult to employ the <b>staff</b> <b>and</b> <b>resources</b> necessary to build full-fledged community campaigns. More and more unions came to rely on the corporate campaign even as it became less and less effective.|$|E
25|$|On January 1, 1999, Belo {{launched}} Texas Cable News (TXCN), {{a statewide}} cable news channel that initially featured rolling news, weather and sports content, {{as well as}} public affairs, sports-talk and entertainment news programs, utilizing <b>staff</b> <b>and</b> <b>resources</b> from WFAA and sister stations KVUE, KHOU and KENS, and The Dallas Morning News. TXCN switched to a format primarily consisting of repackaged newscasts featuring segments seen on each of Belo's Texas-based stations, and in-house weather segments on January 1, 2005, citing limited cable distribution in Texas' largest television markets for the format change {{that resulted in the}} layoffs of 45 of the channel's employees.

25|$|Following {{the liberation}} of Europe in 1945, Zinkeisen was {{commissioned}} by the War Artists' Advisory Committee as a war artist for the North West Europe Commission of the Joint War Organisation of the British Red Cross Society and the Order of St John (JWO). As the organisation's <b>staff</b> <b>and</b> <b>resources</b> moved into newly liberated areas, Zinkeisen's role as a war artist was to record the commission's activities. Based in Brussels at the commission's headquarters she recorded the commission's post-war relief work in north west Europe including the rehabilitation and repatriation of prisoners of war and civilian internees. Zinkeisen traveled by lorry or by air (from a nearby RAF base) throughout north-west Europe making sketches which she brought back to her studio in the commission's headquarters for further work.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} Japanese hospital nurses’ perceptions of the nursing practice environment and examine its association with nurse-reported ability to provide quality nursing care, quality of patient care and ward morale. A cross-sectional survey design was used including 223 nurses working in 12 acute inpatient wards in a large Japanese teaching hospital. Nurses rated their work environment favorably overall using the Japanese version of the Practice Environment Scale of the Nursing Work Index. Subscale scores indicated high perceptions of physician relations and quality of nursing management, but lower scores for <b>staffing</b> <b>and</b> <b>resources.</b> Ward nurse managers generally rated the practice environment more positively than staff nurses except for <b>staffing</b> <b>and</b> <b>resources.</b> Regression analyses found the practice environment was a significant predictor of quality of patient care and ward morale, whereas perceived ability to provide quality nursing care was most strongly associated with years of clinical experience. These findings support interventions to improve the nursing practice environment, particularly <b>staffing</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> adequacy, to enhance quality of care and ward morale in Japan...|$|R

Many of them received standing ovations from appreciative locals as they walked through Christchurch Airport upon arrival. Alongside regular duties, the police provided security cordons, organised evacuations, supported search and rescue teams, missing persons and family liaison, and organised media briefings and tours of the affected areas. They also provided forensic analysis and evidence gathering at fatalities and Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) teams, working closely with pathologists, forensic dentists and scientists, and the coroner at the emergency mortuary established at Burnham Military Camp. They were aided by DVI teams from Australia, UK, Thailand Taiwan and Israel.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, DSPD {{has faced}} steep {{obstacles}} in its mission {{to care for}} Utahns with disabilities. The most acute and recent challenge involved funding issues which arose after the economic downturn of 2008. As state tax receipts fell {{in the months following}} the crisis, the legislature began making difficult decisions about how to fund state programs. The Division was asked to make do with a significant budget reduction. DSPD decided {{that the best way to}} reduce operational costs was to privatize casework. This allowed the Division to preserve critical services. By the end of 2009, all but a handful of caseworkers had transitioned from direct employment with the state to a private contractor. In both 2010 and 2011, the Division met additional budget shortfalls with staffing reductions, to avoid the reduction of critical services to waiver services recipients. It has been challenging for the Division to meet the same workload demands with less <b>staff</b> <b>and</b> <b>resources.</b>|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} job satisfaction and intent to stay for ambulatory oncology nurses. BACKGROUND: An oncology provider shortage suggests that retention is a high priority, and factors associated with job outcomes are unknown in this setting. METHOD: Data were derived from a cross-sectional survey completed by 402 oncology nurses employed in ambulatory settings. Logistic regression models estimated the likelihood of job satisfaction or intent to stay for at least 1 year. RESULTS: Most nurses (80. 9 %) were satisfied and 87. 4 %indicated their intent to stay. Significant variables for job satisfactionwere university/hospital ownership, <b>staffing</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> adequacy, nurse manager ability and leadership, and workloads. Variables significant for intent to stay were <b>staffing</b> <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> adequacy, participation in practice affairs, and years of experience. CONCLUSIONS: Favorable practice environments are key to effective nurse retention. <b>Staffing,</b> leadership, <b>and</b> <b>resource</b> allocation influence retention in ambulatory settings...|$|R

The 28 November edition also included an editorial thanking readers for backing the new publication. Speaking to The Guardian shortly after its launch, Walker said that the initial print run had been set as 30,000, but a last-minute decision was taken to double it, something he described as [...] "in hindsight, a good decision". The Nationals launch and success came at a time of general decline in the print media industry, where news providers were cutting <b>staff</b> <b>and</b> <b>resources</b> due to a downturn in newspaper sales. Douglas Beattie of the New Statesman and Alex Massie of The Spectator reported that copies of the first edition, which sold out, were being auctioned on eBay for at least £10. The Financial Times reported that pro-independence campaigners used social media to help potential readers locate available copies of the paper when the first edition had sold out in many areas.|$|E
2500|$|Local governments {{may choose}} to provide {{services}} by using their own <b>staff</b> <b>and</b> <b>resources</b> for collection, transportation and treatment services. [...] This {{is often the case}} in smaller cities or municipalities where the water utility may not have a broad reach. In many cases, cooperation between the city government and the water district may be strategically advantageous. Dumaguete City, Philippines is one example where the Water District and Local Government have joint ownership and responsibilities for the FSM program. Organized FSM programs may be able to provide the service cheaper and more hygienically than the private operators working independently. Less expensive services is an important selling point when promoting the program to citizens and encouraging them to participate.|$|E

2500|$|According to a {{three months}} study coordinated by the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Research Centre that was {{published}} in the New England Journal of Medicine, up to 20 per cent of intensive care unit(ICU) beds overall were occupied by swine flu patients {{at the height of the}} pandemic in July. In New Zealand hospitals, about 25 per cent of all ICU activity was pandemic related and about 12 per cent of patients hospitalised with swine flu were admitted to ICU. The surge of patients with H1N1 influenza placed substantial strain on <b>staff</b> <b>and</b> <b>resources,</b> hospitals were stretched to the very limit of resources and were at the point where possible alternatives had to be considered. Unlike seasonal influenza strains, which tend to hit elderly people and those of severe underlying health problems more heavily, many of those who became critically ill with the swine flu were babies and middle-aged people, pregnant women, the obese, Pacific Islanders, Maori and Aboriginal patients. Rates of severe illness among Pacific people were seven times higher than the average, while those of Maori were twice as high. Overall, about one-third of patients who was admitted to an ICU because of swine flu had no underlying health problem. The first batch of swine flu vaccine arrived in the country in September. Currently only frontline health workers were in line to get the vaccine, but the Health Ministry is considering on widening access to include other [...] "at risk" [...] groups.|$|E
