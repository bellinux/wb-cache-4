5000|$|Using gel {{mobility}} and analytical ultracentrifugation, {{it was shown}} that Netropsin binding to DNA increases the twist per base by similar to 9Ëš per molecule bound. [...] Thus, it removes <b>supercoils</b> when interacting with positively <b>supercoiled</b> DNA and introduces (additional) negative <b>supercoils</b> when binding to relaxed or negatively <b>supercoiled</b> DNA. Netropsin's effect on <b>supercoiled</b> DNA was observed in detail on single molecules using a magnetic tweezers.|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} to prepare relatively large quantities (>/= 100 microg) of highly positively <b>supercoiled</b> DNA is reported. This uses a recombinant archaeal histone (rHMfB) to introduce toroidal <b>supercoils,</b> and an inexpensive chicken blood extract to relax unrestrained superhelical tension. Preparation of positively <b>supercoiled</b> pUC 19 DNA molecules, > 50 % {{of which have}} linking number changes ranging from+ 8 to+ 17, is demonstrated. Advantages include {{the high degree of}} positive <b>supercoiling</b> that can be achieved, control over the extent of <b>supercoiling,</b> easy production of relatively large quantities of <b>supercoiled</b> DNA, and low cost...|$|R
40|$|Treatment of {{bacterial}} cells with inhibitors of gyrase at high concentration leads to relaxation of DNA <b>supercoils,</b> presumably through {{interference with the}} <b>supercoiling</b> activity of gyrase. Under certain conditions, however, the inhibitors can also increase <b>supercoiling.</b> In the case of coumermycin A 1, this increase occurs at low drug concentrations. Oxolinic acid increases <b>supercoiling</b> in a partially resistant mutant. We found that increases in chromosomal DNA <b>supercoiling,</b> which were blocked by treatment with chloramphenicol, were accompanied by an increased expression rate of gyrA. This result is consistent with gyrase being responsible for the increase in <b>supercoiling.</b> In wild-type cells, increases in gyrA expression were transient, suggesting that when <b>supercoiling</b> reaches sufficiently high levels, gyrase expression declines. Oxolinic acid {{studies carried out with}} a delta topA strain showed that drug treatment also increased plasmid <b>supercoiling.</b> The levels of <b>supercoiling</b> and topoisomer heterogeneity were much higher when the plasmid contained one of several promoters fused to galK. Since oxolinic acid causes an increase in gyrA expression, it appears that gyrase levels may be important in transcription-mediated changes in <b>supercoiling</b> even when topoisomerase I is absent...|$|R

50|$|Gyrase (a form of topoisomerase) relaxes and undoes the {{supercoiling}} {{caused by}} helicase.

40|$|By {{regulating}} {{access to}} the genetic code, DNA <b>supercoiling</b> strongly affects DNA metabolism. Despite its importance, however, much about <b>supercoiled</b> DNA (positively <b>supercoiled</b> DNA, in particular) remains unknown. Here we use electron cryo-tomography together with biochemical analyses to investigate structures of individual purified DNA minicircle topoisomers with defined degrees of <b>supercoiling.</b> Our results reveal that each topoisomer, negative or positive, adopts a unique and surprisingly wide distribution of three-dimensional conformations. Moreover, we uncover striking differences in how the topoisomers handle torsional stress. As negative <b>supercoiling</b> increases, bases are increasingly exposed. Beyond a sharp <b>supercoiling</b> threshold, we also detect exposed bases in positively <b>supercoiled</b> DNA. Molecular dynamics simulations independently confirm the conformational heterogeneity and provide atomistic insight into the flexibility of <b>supercoiled</b> DNA. Our integrated approach reveals the three-dimensional structures of DNA that are essential for its function...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of positive <b>supercoiled</b> DNA by an activity from a hypermutating myeloma line is reported. This activity forms positive <b>supercoils</b> from negative <b>supercoiled</b> DNA, {{it does not}} use positive <b>supercoils</b> to form negative ones and does not require an exogenous source of energy. The linking number changes by steps of 1, suggesting a type-I mechanism of action, {{and there seems to}} be an upper limit to the degree of positive <b>supercoiling</b> that can be achieved. Positive <b>supercoiled</b> DNA has to be taken into account as a possible structure of DNA in vivo for those functions where torsional stress is involved...|$|R
50|$|DNA <b>supercoiling</b> is {{important}} for DNA packaging within all cells. Because the length of DNA can be thousands of times that of a cell, packaging this genetic material into the cell or nucleus (in eukaryotes) is a difficult feat. <b>Supercoiling</b> of DNA reduces the space and allows for DNA to be packaged. In prokaryotes, plectonemic <b>supercoils</b> are predominant, because of the circular chromosome and relatively small amount of genetic material. In eukaryotes, DNA <b>supercoiling</b> exists on many levels of both plectonemic and solenoidal <b>supercoils,</b> with the solenoidal <b>supercoiling</b> proving most effective in compacting the DNA. Solenoidal <b>supercoiling</b> is achieved with histones to form a 10 nm fiber. This fiber is further coiled into a 30 nm fiber, and further coiled upon itself numerous times more.|$|R
50|$|Goldberg also {{collaborated with}} Karman in 1972 to help perform abortions {{on women in}} Bangladesh who had been raped by the Pakistani army. Sandra Kabir {{reported}} that {{hundreds of thousands of}} women had been raped in Bangladesh at this time. Later, Karman and Goldberg had a serious problem with an experimental abortion method known as the <b>supercoil</b> abortion which later caused dangerous side effects. Goldberg intended to help women from Chicago who were scheduled to have abortions, but whose clinic had been shut down. On the weekend of May 13, 1972, she brought the women to Philadelphia where Karman would use the <b>supercoil</b> method. The method had not been tested carefully prior to using it on the women from Chicago. Critics of the incident said that women were being experimented on, however, Goldberg insisted that they knew the risks going into the procedure. Karman and Goldberg again helped provide abortions in Cyprus in 1974 where women had been raped during the Turkish invasion.|$|E
50|$|Chromatin {{can form}} a {{tertiary}} chromatin structure and be compacted even {{further than the}} solenoid structure by forming supercoils which have a diameter of around 700 nm. This <b>supercoil</b> is formed by regions of DNA called scaffold/matrix attachment regions (SMARs) attaching to a central scaffolding matrix in the nucleus creating loops of solenoid chromatin between 4.5 and 112 kilobase pairs long. The central scaffolding matrix itself forms a spiral shape for an additional layer of compaction.|$|E
5000|$|In a [...] "relaxed" [...] double-helical {{segment of}} B-DNA, the two strands twist around the helical axis once every 10.4-10.5 base pairs of sequence. Adding or {{subtracting}} twists, as some enzymes can do, imposes strain. If a DNA segment under twist strain were closed into a circle by joining its two ends and then allowed to move freely, the circular DNA would contort {{into a new}} shape, such as a simple figure-eight. Such a contortion is a <b>supercoil.</b> The noun form [...] "supercoil" [...] is often used {{in the context of}} DNA topology.|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that transcriptionally active chromatin contains totally unconstrained <b>supercoiling.</b> The results of recent studies have raised the possibility that this topological state is the property of highly transcribed genes. Since the transcription rate of RNA polymerase II genes can be dramatically increased {{by the presence of}} an enhancer, we have determined if the transcription complex of an enhancer-activated plasmid contains totally unconstrained <b>supercoils.</b> Following transfection into COS 7 cells, the topology of the transcription complex DNA was determined directly by agarose gel electrophoresis. We find that an enhancer-activated plasmid transcription complex is <b>supercoiled,</b> and these <b>supercoils</b> remain following topoisomerase I treatment. Thus the transcribing complexes contain constrained <b>supercoils,</b> and the level of <b>supercoiling</b> suggests a nucleosome-like organization. However, we cannot {{rule out the possibility that}} unconstrained <b>supercoils</b> exist in addition to these constrained <b>supercoils</b> in the transcription complex in the cell...|$|R
50|$|Lobal contortions of a {{circular}} DNA, {{such as the}} rotation of the figure-eight lobes above, are referred to as writhe. The above example illustrates that twist and writhe are interconvertible. <b>Supercoiling</b> can be represented mathematically by the sum of twist and writhe. The twist is the number of helical turns in the DNA and the writhe is the number of times the double helix crosses over on itself (these are the <b>supercoils).</b> Extra helical twists are positive and lead to positive <b>supercoiling,</b> while subtractive twisting causes negative <b>supercoiling.</b> Many topoisomerase enzymes sense <b>supercoiling</b> and either generate or dissipate it as they change DNA topology. DNA of most organisms is negatively <b>supercoiled.</b>|$|R
40|$|Type II DNA topoisomerases {{catalyze}} {{the transport}} of one DNA double helix through another. Here, by using a non-hydrolyzable analog of ATP, I examined the single-step DNA transport preferences of the yeast type II topoisomerase bound to positively and negatively <b>supercoiled</b> DNA rings. I found that negative <b>supercoiling</b> favors decatenation of DNA rings more than positive <b>supercoiling.</b> Conversely, positive <b>supercoiling</b> favors the catenation and knotting of DNA rings more than negative <b>supercoiling.</b> This vectorial effect of DNA <b>supercoiling</b> handedness supports a model in which type II topoisomerases can recognize three DNA segments, and highlights a novel influence of DNA <b>supercoiling</b> in global DNA topology.

50|$|Positively supercoiled (overwound) DNA is transiently {{generated}} during DNA replication and transcription, and, if not promptly relaxed, inhibits (regulates) these processes. The simple figure eight is {{the simplest}} <b>supercoil,</b> {{and is the}} shape a circular DNA assumes to accommodate one too many or one too few helical twists. The two lobes of the figure eight will appear rotated either clockwise or counterclockwise with respect to one another, {{depending on whether the}} helix is over- or underwound. For each additional helical twist being accommodated, the lobes will show one more rotation about their axis. As a general rule, the DNA of most organisms is negatively supercoiled.|$|E
50|$|Eight DnaA protein molecules, {{all in the}} ATP-bound state, {{assemble}} to form a helical complex encompassing the R and I {{sites in}} oriC. DnaA has a higher affinity for the R sites than I sites, and binds R sites equally well in its ATP or ADP-bound form. The I sites, which bind only the ATP-bound DnaA, allow discrimination between the active and inactive forms of DnaA. The tight right-handed wrapping of the DNA around this complex introduces an effective positive <b>supercoil.</b> The associated strain in the nearby DNA leads to denaturation in the A:T-rich 'DUE' (DNA Unwinding Element) region. The complex formed at the replication origin also includes several DNA-binding proteins- Hu, IHF and FIS that facilitate DNA bending.|$|E
50|$|DNA gyrase is an {{important}} enzyme that introduces a negative <b>supercoil</b> to the DNA and {{is responsible for the}} biological processes in DNA replication and transcription. DNA gyrase is made of two subunits, A and B. These subunits are denoted as gyrA and gyrB. The gyrB gene, subunit B protein, is a type II topoisomerase that is essential for DNA replication. This gene is conserved among bacterial species. The rate of evolution at the molecular level deduced from gyrB related gene sequences can be determined at more accelerated rate compared to the 16S rRNA gene sequences. These subunits have provided a way to phylogenetically distinguish between the diversity of species related to B. pumilus, which includes B. safensis. Strain B. safensis DSM19292 shares 90.2% gyrA sequence similarity with B. pumilus strain DSM 27.|$|E
40|$|DNA in {{bacterial}} chromosomes and bacterial plasmids is <b>supercoiled.</b> DNA <b>supercoiling</b> {{is essential}} for DNA replication and gene regulation. However, the density of <b>supercoiling</b> in vivo is circa twice smaller than in deproteinized DNA molecules isolated from bacteria. What are then the specific advantages of reduced <b>supercoiling</b> density that is maintained in vivo? Using Brownian dynamics simulations and atomic force microscopy we show here that thanks to physiological DNA-DNA crowding DNA molecules with reduced <b>supercoiling</b> density are still sufficiently <b>supercoiled</b> to stimulate interaction between cis-regulatory elements. On the other hand, weak <b>supercoiling</b> permits DNA molecules to modulate their overall shape in response to physiological changes in DNA crowding. This plasticity of DNA shapes may have regulatory role and be important for the postreplicative spontaneous segregation of bacterial chromosome...|$|R
40|$|Positive <b>supercoils</b> are {{introduced}} in cellular DNA {{in front of}} and negative <b>supercoils</b> behind tracking polymerases. Since DNA purified from cells is normally under-wound, most studies addressing the relaxation activity of topoisomerase I have utilized negatively <b>supercoiled</b> plasmids. The present report compares the relaxation activity of human topoisomerase I variants on plasmids containing equal numbers of superhelical twists with opposite handedness. We demonstrate that the wild-type enzyme and mutants lacking amino acids 1 â€“ 206 or 191 â€“ 206, or having tryptophane- 205 replaced with a glycine relax positive <b>supercoils</b> faster than negative <b>supercoils</b> under both processive and distributive conditions. In contrast to wild-type topoisomerase I, which exhibited camptothecin sensitivity during relaxation of both negative and positive <b>supercoils,</b> the investigated N-terminally mutated variants were sensitive to camptothecin only during removal of positive <b>supercoils.</b> These data suggest different mechanisms of action during removal of <b>supercoils</b> of opposite handedness and are consistent with a recently published simulation study [Sari and Andricioaei (2005) Nucleic Acids Res., 33, 6621 â€“ 6634] suggesting flexibility in distinct parts of the enzyme during clockwise or counterclockwise strand rotation...|$|R
40|$|The genome of {{temperate}} mycobacteriophage L 5 {{integrates into}} the chromosomes of its hosts, including Mycobacterium smegmatis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and bacille Calmette-Guerin. This integrase-mediated site-specific recombination reaction occurs between the phage attP {{site and the}} mycobacterial attB site and requires the mycobacterial integration host factor. Here we examine the role of <b>supercoiling</b> in this reaction and show that integration is stimulated by DNA <b>supercoiling</b> but that <b>supercoiling</b> of either the attP or the attB substrate enhances recombination. <b>Supercoiling</b> thus facilitates a postsynaptic recombination event. We also show that, while <b>supercoiling</b> is not required {{for the production of}} a recombinagenic intasome, a mutant attP DNA deficient in binding of the host factor acquires a dependence on <b>supercoiling</b> for intasome formation and recombination...|$|R
50|$|A covalently closed, {{circular}} DNA (also {{known as}} cccDNA) is topologically constrained {{as the number}} of times the chains coiled around one other cannot change. This cccDNA can be supercoiled, which is the tertiary structure of DNA. Supercoiling is characterized by the linking number, twist and writhe. The linking number (Lk) for circular DNA is defined {{as the number of}} times one strand would have to pass through the other strand to completely separate the two strands. The linking number for circular DNA can only be changed by breaking of a covalent bond in one of the two strands. Always an integer, the linking number of a cccDNA is the sum of two components: twists (Tw) and writhes (Wr).Twists are the number of times the two strands of DNA are twisted around each other. Writhes are number of times the DNA helix crosses over itself. DNA in cells is negatively supercoiled and has the tendency to unwind. Hence the separation of strands is easier in negatively supercoiled DNA than in relaxed DNA. The two components of supercoiled DNA are solenoid and plectonemic. The plectonemic <b>supercoil</b> is found in prokaryotes, while the solenoidal supercoiling is mostly seen in eukaryotes.|$|E
50|$|Simply {{twisting}} DNA can expose internal {{bases to}} the outside, {{without the aid}} of any proteins. Also, transcription itself contorts DNA in living human cells, tightening some parts of the coil and loosening it in others. That stress triggers changes in shape, most notably opening up the helix to be read. Unfortunately, these interactions are very difficult to study because biological molecules morph shapes so easily. In 2008 it was noted that transcription twists DNA, leaving a trail of undercoiled (or negatively supercoiled) DNA in its wake. Moreover, they discovered that the DNA sequence itself effects how the molecule responds to supercoiling. For example, the researchers identified a specific sequence of DNA that regulates transcription speed; as the amount of <b>supercoil</b> rises and falls, it slows or speeds the pace at which molecular machinery reads DNA. It is hypothesized that these structural changes might trigger stress elsewhere along its length, which in turn might provide trigger points for replication or gene expression. This implies that it is a very dynamic process in which both DNA and proteins each influences how the other acts and reacts.|$|E
5000|$|Leucine zipper {{is created}} by the dimerization of two {{specific}} alpha helix monomers bound to DNA. The bZIP interacts with the DNA via its N-terminal, where the lysines and arginines are located; these basic residues interact in the major groove of the DNA, forming sequence-specific interactions. The leucine zipper {{is located in the}} C-terminal region of the bZIP and it forms an amphipathic alpha helix. When that alpha helix dimerizes, the zipper is formed. The hydrophobic side of the helix forms a dimer with itself or another similar helix, burying the non-polar amino acids away from the solvent. The hydrophilic side of the helix interacts with the water in the solvent. Leucine zipper domains are considered a subtype of coiled coils, which are built by two or more alpha helices that are wound around each other to form a <b>supercoil.</b> Coiled coils contain 3- and 4-residue repeats whose hydrophobicity pattern and residue composition is compatible with the structure of amphipathic alpha-helices. The alternating three- and four-residue sequence elements constitute heptad repeats in which the amino acids are designated from aâ€™ to gâ€™, whereas residues in positions a and d are generally hydrophobic and form a zigzag pattern of knobs and holes that interlock with a similar pattern on another strand to form a tight-fitting hydrophobic core.|$|E
5000|$|The unique {{ability of}} gyrase to {{introduce}} negative <b>supercoils</b> into DNA {{at the expense}} of ATP hydrolysis [...] is what allows bacterial DNA to have free negative <b>supercoils.</b> The ability of gyrase to relax positive <b>supercoils</b> comes into play during DNA replication and prokaryotic transcription. The right-handed nature of the DNA double helix causes positive <b>supercoils</b> to accumulate ahead of a translocating enzyme, in the case of DNA replication, a DNA polymerase. The ability of gyrase (and topoisomerase IV) to relax positive <b>supercoils</b> allows superhelical tension ahead of the polymerase to be released so that replication can continue.|$|R
40|$|A transcribing RNA {{polymerase}} {{is thought}} to generate positive <b>supercoils</b> {{in front of the}} advancing transcription complex and negative <b>supercoils</b> behind. We have examined the possibility that positive <b>supercoils</b> might destabilize nucleosomes, facilitating transcription. We show that histone octamers bind to positively <b>supercoiled</b> DNA, and that after the complex is relaxed, 'classical' nucleosomes are present. We tested the possibility that nucleosomes on positively <b>supercoiled</b> DNA are in an altered (presumably more open) conformation, but revert to the classical structure only on release of this stress. However, circular dichroic spectra, and chemical cross-linking and modification of core histones, all suggest that the complexes initially formed on positively <b>supercoiled</b> DNA are classical nucleosomes. Although such structures are stable, their formation requires the plasmid to become more positively <b>supercoiled,</b> resulting in greater superhelical stress. In contrast, formation of nucleosomes on negatively <b>supercoiled</b> DNA relieves superhelical stress. In an exchange experiment in which equilibrium is achieved, nucleosomes transfer from positively to negatively <b>supercoiled</b> DNA, as predicted from the super-coiling free energies of the reactions. This suggests a mechanism for transcription of a gene assembled into chromatin, in which octamers are sequentially transferred from the region in front of the polymerase to the region behind...|$|R
40|$|In a {{posterior}} {{silk gland}} extract, covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA is in a superhelical state that supports more transcription of fibroin gene than does linear DNA. A HeLa cell extract showed neither the <b>supercoiling</b> activity nor {{the preference for}} the transcription of ccc DNA over linear DNA. These activities could {{be added to the}} HeLa cell extract. Phosphocellulose fractionation of the posterior silk gland extract yielded a flow-through fraction and a 0. 6 M KCl eluate fraction that were required for the <b>supercoiling</b> and for the efficient transcription of the ccc template in the acceptor HeLa cell extract. The 0. 6 M KCl fraction had a DNA topoisomerase II activity, and the flow-through fraction contained a <b>supercoiling</b> factor that, with the aid of topoisomerase II, introduced negative <b>supercoils</b> into ccc DNA. When both fractions were added to the posterior silk gland extract, more <b>supercoiling</b> occurred than with the extract alone. Several genes were optimally transcribed under various extents of <b>supercoiling.</b> The fibroin gene and adenovirus 2 major late promoter were fully transcribed as partially <b>supercoiled</b> templates. The sericin gene required more <b>supercoiling</b> for full transcription, whereas no preference for <b>supercoiling</b> was seen with the transcription of hsp 70. These results suggest that DNA topology plays a role in the regulation of gene expression...|$|R
40|$|Gyrase catalyzes {{negative}} supercoiling of DNA in an ATP-dependent {{reaction that}} helps condense bacterial chromosomes into a compact interwound "nucleoid. " The <b>supercoil</b> density (Ïƒ) of prokaryotic DNA occurs in two forms. Diffusible <b>supercoil</b> density (Ïƒ(D)) moves freely around the chromosome in 10 kb domains, and constrained <b>supercoil</b> density (Ïƒ(C)) results from binding abundant proteins that bend, loop, or unwind DNA at many sites. Diffusible and constrained supercoils contribute roughly equally {{to the total}} in vivo negative <b>supercoil</b> density of WT cells, so Ïƒâ€Š=â€ŠÏƒ(C) +Ïƒ(D). Unexpectedly, Escherichia coli chromosomes have a 15 % higher level of Ïƒ compared to Salmonella enterica. To decipher critical mechanisms that can change diffusible <b>supercoil</b> density of chromosomes, we analyzed strains of Salmonella using a 9 kb "supercoil sensor" inserted at ten positions around the genome. The sensor contains a complete Lac operon flanked by directly repeated resolvase binding sites, and the sensor can monitor both <b>supercoil</b> density and transcription elongation rates in WT and mutant strains. RNA transcription caused (-) supercoiling to increase upstream and decrease downstream of highly expressed genes. Excess upstream supercoiling was relaxed by Topo I, and gyrase replenished downstream <b>supercoil</b> losses to maintain an equilibrium state. Strains with TS gyrase mutations growing at permissive temperature exhibited significant <b>supercoil</b> losses varying from 30 % of WT levels to a total loss of Ïƒ(D) at most chromosome locations. <b>Supercoil</b> losses were influenced by transcription because addition of rifampicin (Rif) caused <b>supercoil</b> density to rebound throughout the chromosome. Gyrase mutants that caused dramatic <b>supercoil</b> losses also reduced the transcription elongation rates throughout the genome. The observed link between RNA polymerase elongation speed and gyrase turnover suggests that bacteria with fast growth rates may generate higher <b>supercoil</b> densities than slow growing species...|$|E
40|$|Entangling and {{twisting}} of cellular DNA (i. e., supercoiling) are problems inherent to the helical structure of double-stranded DNA.

Here, we summarize how supercoiling is generated and review experimental and theoretical insights into <b>supercoil</b> relaxation.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analytical}} {{calculation of the}} electrostatic interaction in a plectonemic <b>supercoil</b> within the Poisson-Boltzmann approximation. Undulations of the <b>supercoil</b> strands arising from thermal motion couple nonlinearly with the electrostatic interaction, giving rise to a strong enhancement of the bare interaction. In the limit of fairly tight winding, the free energy of a plectonemic <b>supercoil</b> may be split into an elastic contribution containing the bending and torsional energies and an electrostatic-undulatory free energy. The total free energy of the <b>supercoil</b> is minimized according to an iterative scheme, which utilizes the special symmetry inherent in the usual elastic free energy of the plectoneme. The superhelical radius, opening angle, and undulation amplitudes in the radius and pitch are obtained {{as a function of}} the specific linking difference and the concentration of monovalent salt. Our results compare favorably with the experimental values for these parameters of Boles et al. (1990. J. Mol. Biol. 213 : 931 - 951). In particular, we confirm the experimental observation that the writhe is a virtually constant fraction of the excess linking number over a wide range of superhelical densities. Another important prediction is the ionic strength dependence of the plectonemic parameters, which is in reasonable agreement with the results from computer simulations...|$|E
50|$|<b>Supercoiling</b> is also {{required}} for DNA/RNA synthesis. Because DNA must be unwound for DNA/RNA polymerase action, <b>supercoils</b> will result.

Upon in vitro relaxation with eukaryotic topoisomerase I, the minichromosomes remained DNase I sensitive but were converted to negative DNA <b>supercoiling</b> with a slightly increased linking number compared to typical minichromosomes, thus indicating the presence of bound histones.

40|$|The ATP-dependent {{movement}} of simian virus 40 large tumor antigen on DNA can cause positive <b>supercoiling</b> of template DNA {{in the presence}} of bacterial DNA topoisomerase I, which specifically relaxes negative <b>supercoils.</b> With such a <b>supercoiling</b> assay, an activity capable of ATP-dependent, positive <b>supercoiling</b> of DNA {{in the presence of}} bacterial DNA topoisomerase I was found in 7 S particles prepared from Xenopus laevis oocytes but not in purified transcription factor IIIA. The positive <b>supercoils</b> accumulated during the reaction are strained, as evidenced by their sensitivity to eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I. Purification of this activity led to the identification of a DNA-dependent ATPase. Molar excess of transcription factor IIIA or spermidine was found to strongly stimulate the <b>supercoiling</b> reaction of the purified ATPase. These results suggest that this DNA-dependent ATPase can interact with and translocate along closed-circular duplex DNA, producing local alterations in the <b>supercoiled</b> state of the DNA template in a manner analogous to that of simian virus 40 large tumor antigen...|$|R
