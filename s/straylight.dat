5|$|Three {{shows of}} the band's 24-date {{headlining}} US tour with Moneen, Senses Fail, and The Beautiful Mistake had sold out prior to even having released a single, {{with much of}} the buzz surrounding the band being produced by just word-of-mouth, touring and Internet message boards. Deja Entendus success also earned them tours alongside New Found Glory, Good Charlotte, Dashboard Confessional, and Blink-182. The band went on to headline The Bamboozle festival with My Chemical Romance, Alkaline Trio, Thrice, The Starting Line, Fall Out Boy, The Bouncing Souls, <b>Straylight</b> Run and Flogging Molly. They also made their second trip to the UK in 2004, their first as the headline act, the tour completely sold out.|$|E
5|$|Gibson's {{work has}} {{influenced}} several popular musicians: references to his fiction {{appear in the}} music of Stuart Hamm, Billy Idol, Warren Zevon, Deltron 3030, <b>Straylight</b> Run (whose name is derived from a sequence in Neuromancer) and Sonic Youth. U2's Zooropa album was heavily influenced by Neuromancer, and the band at one point planned to scroll the text of Neuromancer above them on a concert tour, although this did not end up happening. Members of the band did, however, provide background music for the audiobook version of Neuromancer as well as appearing in No Maps for These Territories, a biographical documentary of Gibson. He returned the favour by writing {{an article about the}} band's Vertigo Tour for Wired in August 2005. The band Zeromancer take their name from Neuromancer.|$|E

500|$|Cooper {{said the}} band members relied [...] "on each other instead of forcing each other to play something". Guitarist Eddie Reyes insisted on playing his own part, {{as opposed to a}} chord progression, on several occasions. Cooper said [...] "So instead of trying to force him to play one thing, he’ll go and do his own thing that’s way more cool and unique that any of us could imagine." [...] Lazzara {{mentioned}} there was [...] "an urgency and an energy and an excitement" [...] embedded into the material, which [...] "you can't create or fake". Nolan stated that <b>Straylight</b> Run helped Cooper and himself as musicians: [...] "We learned, we grew and were much more mature coming back to TBS." [...] Cooper mentioned that {{towards the end of the}} writing process the group's [...] "creative juices ... were just so depleted".|$|E
500|$|In February and March 2010, Taking Back Sunday {{participated in}} the Australian festival Soundwave.

Guitarist Matthew Fazzi also received a call from the group, saying that they were [...] "letting [...] go." [...] On March 29, statements by Fazzi and Rubano announcing their departure from the group were posted on the band's website.

The group was due to tour the UK with Brand New in May and June, however, all of the shows were {{cancelled}} amongst rumours of the band breaking up. In early May, the group issued a statement, explaining that [...] "There have {{been a series of}} personal events with members of the band ... We need very much {{to take a step back}} at this time". Around this time, Nolan (citing exhaustion from touring) left the band, and Cooper followed shortly afterwards. According to Lazzara, Nolan and Cooper were [...] "having trouble because everything was happening so fast. Going from being home ... to being gone all the time and having your whole life consumed and almost defined by the band that you’re in is a lot to handle". The band briefly considered breaking up. Nolan and Cooper formed <b>Straylight</b> Run with Nolan's sister, Michelle, and Breaking Pangaea drummer Will Noon.|$|E
2500|$|Davis' {{first show}} {{with the band}} was at the Viper Room in Los Angeles, in July 2006.

They played three songs off the upcoming album: [...] "Crawl", [...] "Weather The Storm", and the single [...] "Taking Back Control".
