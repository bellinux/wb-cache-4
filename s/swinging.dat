5|$|In the 1960s, calypso and {{steelband}} music {{became very}} popular and indeed replaced lapo kabwit and chanté mas {{as the music}} of carnival, particularly in the capital Roseau. Many of the traditional songs were performed in the new calypso beat. Calypsonians and Calypso Monarch competitions emerged and became extremely popular. Steelbands emerged all around the country. The older musicians and bands had moved on and were replaced by the younger musicians. Bands such as <b>Swinging</b> Stars, The Gaylords, De Boys an Dem, Los Caballeros and <b>Swinging</b> Busters surfaced and began to cut records. The emergence of radio, first WIDBS and later Radio Dominica helped to spread the music.|$|E

5|$|Although Galileo seriously {{considered}} the priesthood {{as a young}} man, at his father's urging he instead enrolled at the University of Pisa for a medical degree. In 1581, when he was studying medicine, he noticed a <b>swinging</b> chandelier, which air currents shifted about to swing in larger and smaller arcs. To him, it seemed, by comparison with his heartbeat, that the chandelier took {{the same amount of}} time to swing back and forth, no matter how far it was <b>swinging.</b> When he returned home, he set up two pendulums of equal length and swung one with a large sweep and the other with a small sweep and found that they kept time together. It was not until the work of Christiaan Huygens, almost one hundred years later, that the tautochrone nature of a <b>swinging</b> pendulum was used to create an accurate timepiece. Up to this point, Galileo had deliberately been kept away from mathematics, since a physician earned a higher income than a mathematician. However, after accidentally attending a lecture on geometry, he talked his reluctant father into letting him study mathematics and natural philosophy instead of medicine. He created a thermoscope, a forerunner of the thermometer, and, in 1586, published a small book on the design of a hydrostatic balance he had invented (which first brought him to the attention of the scholarly world). Galileo also studied disegno, a term encompassing fine art, and, in 1588, obtained the position of instructor in the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno in Florence, teaching perspective and chiaroscuro. Being inspired by the artistic tradition of the city and the works of the Renaissance artists, Galileo acquired an aesthetic mentality. While a young teacher at the Accademia, he began a lifelong friendship with the Florentine painter Cigoli, who included Galileo's lunar observations in one of his paintings.|$|E

50|$|A {{familiar}} {{example is}} a playground <b>swing,</b> which acts as a pendulum. Pushing {{a person in a}} <b>swing</b> in time with the natural interval of the <b>swing</b> (its resonant frequency) makes the <b>swing</b> go higher and higher (maximum amplitude), while attempts to push the <b>swing</b> at a faster or slower tempo produce smaller arcs. This is because the energy the <b>swing</b> absorbs is maximized when the pushes match the <b>swing's</b> natural oscillations.|$|R
5|$|Dominican {{popular music}} history {{can be traced}} back to the 1940s and '50s, when dance bands like the Casimir Brothers and, later, The <b>Swinging</b> Stars, became famous across the island.

5|$|During exploration, the Prince navigates areas {{filled with}} traps: these traps include spike pits, arrow traps, {{wall-mounted}} blades and saws, and spinning spiked stakes. The Prince's main contextual move is wall-running, an action where he runs up onto and along a wall {{for a set}} distance, either to land on or jump off to a platform. The Prince's other acrobatic abilities include climbing along and across ledges, walking along beams, <b>swinging</b> on and jumping from poles, jumping onto and between pillars, and <b>swinging</b> on ropes. Large environmental puzzles are encountered during the Prince's journey, extending across multiple areas in large rooms. Many puzzles are cooperative, requiring Farah's help to complete them. In combat, the Prince fights monsters created by the Sands infecting the Palace's inhabitants. A single command contextually triggered different moves depending on position and directional movement, while other special moves such as a somersault attack and bouncing off walls into enemies require additional commands. Enemies can only be killed by stabbing them with the Dagger of Time, which gathers up the Sands inside them.|$|E

5|$|Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games is a {{collection}} of twenty-four events based on the Olympic Games. On the Wii, the events consist of using the motion sensor capabilities of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk attachment to control the actions of the on-screen character. The player moves the remote {{in a manner similar to}} the method the separate games are played in real life; for example, <b>swinging</b> the Wii Remote to replicate hammer throw or pulling back the remote and tilting the Nunchuk like a bow and arrow. While the Nunchuck is required for archery, it is optional for most of the events. There are also events that are more physically demanding, such as the five running events which require rapid drumming of the controller. Some aspects of the gameplay are computer controlled. For example, in table tennis the player movement is controlled by the Wii, while the <b>swinging</b> of the racket is controlled by the player. The DS game is the same in design, but due to lack of motion controls, its events are much less physically demanding than those on the Wii. For example, instead of drumming the controller, players have to quickly stroke the touchscreen.|$|E

50|$|The {{sum of all}} the <b>swings</b> between parties must equal zero. In a three party system, {{the most}} {{complicated}} <b>swings</b> will involve a major <b>swing</b> either to or from one political party, with this <b>swing</b> being made up of two components {{from each of the}} other two parties. For instance there may be a 3-point <b>swing</b> towards the Purple party, consisting of a 2% <b>swing</b> from the Orange party and a 1-point <b>swing</b> from the Brown party. Alternatively, there may be a 5-point <b>swing</b> from the Orange party, of which 3 points are towards the Brown party and 2 towards the Purple party.|$|R
30|$|This number also {{indicates}} {{how many times}} the <b>swing</b> leg <b>swings</b> until it lands in each step [8]. Each leg is allowed to <b>swing</b> for T_b/ 2 during each step. The largest step is obtained if the <b>swing</b> leg lands on the ground, T_l/ 2 after it has started to <b>swing.</b> Therefore, the condition for the largest step is T_b/ 2 = T_l/ 2, or r_p = 1. When r_p = 2, T_b/ 2 is equal to T_l. In this case, the stride becomes zero because T_l is the period of full leg <b>swing,</b> {{which means that the}} <b>swing</b> leg lands on the ground at the same place as it is lifted up. When r_p = 3, T_b/ 2 is equal to (1 + 1 / 2) T_l, which indicates that the <b>swing</b> leg <b>swings</b> one full forward <b>swing,</b> one full backward <b>swing,</b> and one more full forward <b>swing.</b> This period ratio also maximizes the stride but it has unnecessary leg <b>swings,</b> compared to the gait for r_p = 1. Similarly, any odd integer numbers of r_p can realize the maximum step length, but as r_p becomes larger, the gait contains more unnecessary leg <b>swings.</b> Therefore, {{it can be said that}} period ratio of 1 realizes the ideal walking.|$|R

5|$|Skyscrapers in {{the sets}} were oblong cubes that were shot from an angle that exaggerated their height. To create {{the effect of}} {{sunlight}} glimmering off the buildings, one person would stand {{on one side of}} the cubes with a mirror, and another would stand on the opposite side with a light bulb and swing it back and forth, so the mirror could catch reflections of the <b>swinging</b> light and throw it back onto the skyscrapers. To create a sense of hysteria and excitement surrounding an opening night performance, a skyscraper was photographed with the camera <b>swinging</b> quickly up and down from side to side. While scenes from miniature sets were composed of long shots, scenes were actors were shot entirely in close-ups, which make up about 300 feet of the final film reel. Rather than attempting to put the actor into the miniature backgrounds through trick photography, the scenes were cut rapidly and successively, so the viewer first sees the actor and then the set, creating the impression they are in the same place. Sets involving actors were minimalistic, with some consisting of only a few elements like a table, telephone, two chairs, and a cigar.|$|E

5|$|The {{shoulder}} of Acrocanthosaurus was {{limited in its}} range of motion {{compared to that of}} humans. The arm could not swing in a complete circle, but could retract (swing backwards) 109° from the vertical, so that the humerus could actually be angled slightly upwards. Protraction (<b>swinging</b> forward) was limited to only 24° past the vertical. The arm was unable to reach a vertical position when adducting (<b>swinging</b> downwards), but could abduct (swing upwards) to 9° above horizontal. Movement at the elbow was also limited compared to humans, with a total range of motion of only 57°. The arm could not completely extend (straighten), nor could it flex (bend) very far, with the humerus unable even to form a right angle with the forearm. The radius and ulna (forearm bones) locked together so that there was no possibility of pronation or supination (twisting) as in human forearms.|$|E

40|$|Objective. There {{is little}} {{descriptive}} {{research on the}} motion the body displays during the golf <b>swing.</b> The purpose {{of this research is}} to review the modern golf <b>swing</b> and compare its motion to the classic golf <b>swing.</b> Discussion. The comparison revealed subtle but significant differences in the backswing and the follow-through positions. The potential implications for power and injury, particularly of the lower back, are discussed. The discussion describes a third <b>swing,</b> the hybrid <b>swing,</b> which is a combination of the classic and modern <b>swing.</b> The hybrid <b>swing</b> may potentially reduce the chances of sustaining a low back injury while still retaining the power of the modern <b>swing.</b> Conclusion. The golf <b>swing</b> has evolved over time {{as a result of a}} combination of advanced equipment, course design and human experimentation. The hybrid <b>swing</b> is being taught by some golf professionals as a balance between the power-potential of the modern <b>swing</b> and the ‘back-friendly’ nature of the classic <b>swing,</b> though no studies have so far been conducted on its efficacy. Further investigation into the three golf <b>swings,</b> classic, modern and hybrid, is required to determine which <b>swing</b> is the most effective while also being friendly to the body. Such research will make possible the development programmes aimed at reducing golf injury rates, particularly to the lower back. 13 page(s...|$|R
