40|$|The {{choice of}} the optimum {{semiconductor}} for manufacturing thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cells is not straightforward. In contrast to conventional solar photovoltaics (PV) where the optimum semiconductor bandgap is determined solely by the spectrum (and eventually the irradiance) of the incident solar light, in a TPV converter {{it depends on the}} emitter temperature and on the spectral control elements determining the net <b>spectral</b> <b>power</b> <b>flux</b> between the TPV cell and the emitter. Additionally, in TPV converters there is a tradeoff between power density and conversion efficiency that does not exist in conventional solar PV systems. Thus, the {{choice of the}} proper semiconductor compound in TPV converters requires a thorough analysis that has not been presented so far. This paper presents the optimum semiconductor bandgaps leading to the maximum efficiency and power density in TPV converters using both single junction and multijunction TPV cells. These results were obtained {{within the framework of the}} detailed balance theory and assuming only radiative recombination. Optimal bandgaps are provided as a function of the emitter and cell temperature, as well as the degree of spectral control. I show that multijunction TPV cells are excellent candidates to maximize both the efficiency and the power density simultaneously, eliminating the historical tradeoff between efficiency and power density of TPV converters. Finally, multijunction TPV cells are less sensitive to photon recycling losses, which suggest that they can be combined with relatively simple cut-off spectral control systems to provide practically-viable high performing TPV devices...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a new method for preprocessing STFT phasevocoder frames for improved performance in real-time onset detection, which we term "adaptive whitening". The procedure involves normalising {{the magnitude of}} each bin {{according to a recent}} maximum value for that bin, with the aim of allowing each bin to achieve a similar dynamic range over time, which helps to mitigate against the influence of spectral roll-off and strongly-varying dynamics. Adaptive whitening requires no training, is relatively lightweight to compute, and can run in real-time. Yet it can improve onset detector performance by more than ten percentage points (peak F-measure) in some cases, and improves the performance of most of the onset detectors tested. We present results demonstrating that adaptive whitening can significantly improve the performance of various STFT-based onset detection functions, including functions based on the <b>power,</b> <b>spectral</b> <b>flux,</b> phase deviation, and complex deviation measures. Our results find the process to be especially beneficial for certain types of audio signal (e. g. complex mixtures such as pop music) ...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} compare q-EEG parameters among elderly controls, patients with mild cognitive impairment group (MCI), and patients with four different stages of AD. Moreover, we tried to identify the variables that are correlated with the degree of cognitive impairment. Methods: After logarithmic transformation of relative <b>spectral</b> <b>power,</b> we analyzed the topographical relative <b>spectral</b> <b>power</b> and occipital peak frequency in each group. Multiple regression analysis was applied to these variables to identify parameters related with K-MMSE. Results: (1) In AD patients with less than CDR 0. 5, peak frequency in occipital lead was significantly lower than that of elderly controls.

40|$|Objective: To analyze {{spectral}} {{and spatial}} signatures of high frequency oscillations (HFOs), which include ripples and fast ripples (FRs, > 200 Hz) by quantitatively assessing average and peak <b>spectral</b> <b>power</b> in a rat model of {{different stages of}} epileptogenesis. Methods: The lithium–pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy was used. The acute phase of epilepsy was assessed by recording intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) activity for 1 day after status epilepticus (SE). The chronic phase of epilepsy, including spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs), was assessed by recording EEG activity for 28 days after SE. Average and peak <b>spectral</b> <b>power</b> of five frequency bands of EEG signals in CA 1, CA 3 and DG regions of the hippocampus were analyzed with wavelet and digital filter. Results: FRs occurred in the hippocampus in the animal model. Significant dynamic changes in the <b>spectral</b> <b>power</b> of FRS were identified in CA 1 and CA 3. The average <b>spectral</b> <b>power</b> of ripples increased at 20 min before SE (p < 0. 05), peaked at 10 min before diazepam injection. It decreased at 10 min after diazepam (p < 0. 05) and returned to baseline after 1 hour (h). The average <b>spectral</b> <b>power</b> of FRs increased at 30 min before SE (p < 0. 05) and peaked at 10 min before diazepam. It decreased at 10 min after diazepam (p < 0. 05) and returned to baseline at 2 h after injection. The dynamic changes were similar between average and peak <b>spectral</b> <b>power</b> of FRs. Average and peak <b>spectral</b> <b>power</b> of both ripples and FRs in the chronic phase showed a gradual downward trend compared with normal rats 14 days after SE. Significance: The <b>spectral</b> <b>power</b> of HFOs may be utilized to distinguish between normal and pathologic HFOs. Ictal average and peak <b>spectral</b> <b>power</b> of FRs were two parameters for predicting acute epileptic seizures, {{which could be used}} as a new quantitative biomarker and early warning marker of seizure. Changes in interictal HFOs power in the hippocampus at the chronic stage may be not related to seizure occurrence...|$|R

However, the sluggish nature of the BOLD response means that few researchers have investigated the spectral properties of the BOLD signal in a similar manner.

A traditional General Linear Model (GLM) analysis found no significant group differences, or regions that covaried in signal intensity with task accuracy, suggesting that BOLD <b>spectral</b> <b>power</b> holds unique information that is lost in a standard GLM approach. We suggest that the combination of ICA and BOLD <b>spectral</b> <b>power</b> is a useful novel index of cognitive performance that may be more sensitive to brain-behavior relationships than traditional approache...|$|R

40|$|Reliable {{detection}} of intrapartum fetal acidosis {{is crucial for}} preventing morbidity. Hypoxia-related changes of fetal heart rate variability (FHRV) are controlled by the autonomic nervous system. Subtle changes in FHRV that cannot be identified by inspection can be detected and quantified by <b>power</b> <b>spectral</b> analysis. Sympathetic activity relates to low-frequency FHRV and parasympathetic activity to both low- and high-frequency FHRV. The aim was to study whether intra partum fetal acidosis can be detected by analyzing <b>spectral</b> <b>powers</b> of FHRV, and whether <b>spectral</b> <b>powers</b> associate with hypoxia-induced changes in the fetal electrocardiogram and with the pH of fetal blood samples taken intrapartum. The FHRV of 817 R-R interval recordings, collected {{as a part of}} European multicenter studies, were analyzed. Acidosis was defined as cord pH ≤ 7. 05 or scalp pH ≤ 7. 20, and metabolic acidosis as cord pH ≤ 7. 05 and base deficit ≥ 12 mmol/l. Intrapartum hypoxia increased the <b>spectral</b> <b>powers</b> of FHRV. As fetal acidosis deepened, FHRV decreased: fetuses with significant birth acidosis had, after an initial increase, a drop in <b>spectral</b> <b>powers</b> near delivery, suggesting a breakdown of fetal compensation. Furthermore, a change in excess of 30 % of the low-to-high frequency ratio of FHRV was associated with fetal metabolic acidosis. The results suggest that a decrease in the <b>spectral</b> <b>powers</b> of FHRV signals concern for fetal wellbeing. A single measure alone cannot be used to reveal fetal hypoxia since the <b>spectral</b> <b>powers</b> vary widely intra-individually. With technical developments, continuous assessment of intra-individual changes in <b>spectral</b> <b>powers</b> of FHRV might aid in the {{detection of}} fetal compromise due to hypoxia...|$|R

For clean fireballs with small baryon loading (Γ_ 0 ≳ 300), GRBs are intense, subsecond, medium-to-high energy γ-ray events, and are difficult to detect because of inadequate photon counts given the insufficiently large effective areas (∼ 10 ^ 3 cm^- 2) of > 100 MeV (Γ_ 0 ≲ 30) produce transient emissions which are longer lasting and most luminous at X-ray energies and below, but these events are lost behind the glow of the X-ray and lower-energy background radiations except for rare serindipitous detections by pointed instruments.

LDF signals show low-frequency oscillations related to heartbeat, respiratory, myogenic and endothelial activities.
