5|$|Jared {{initially}} {{tells the}} police nothing {{of what he}} <b>saw.</b> <b>He</b> is torn between the need {{to tell the truth}} and the desire to protect his friends; his anger leads to the breakdown of his relationships with both Rachel and Diane. Despite Jared's silence, police arrest Toby and the three other boys within a few days. Jared decides to tell the police what he saw, as he believes Toby and the other boys will be charged with Tracy's murder; however, on his way into the police station he is confronted by Ricko. Ricko confesses to Jared that he killed Tracy, but claims it was an accident – that she hit her head on a rock when he attempted to have sex with her. He has already told police that he was with Jared all night and asks Jared to confirm his alibi in the name of mateship. Diane, who still {{has not been able to}} tell Jared that she has cancer due to his behaviour, goes in to have surgery.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>saw</b> the tower, whither his charmed {{footsteps}} {{had brought}} him, swarming with dwarf phantoms, spirits, elfin {{creatures of the}} Bells. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> them leaping, flying, dropping, pouring from the Bells without a pause. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> them, round him on the ground; above him, in the air; clambering from him, by the ropes below; looking down upon him, from the massive iron-girded beams; peeping in upon him, through the chinks and loopholes in the walls; spreading away and away from him in enlarging circles, as the water ripples {{give way to a}} huge stone that suddenly comes plashing in among them. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> them, of all aspects and all shapes. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> them ugly, handsome, crippled, exquisitely formed. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> them young, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> them old, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> them kind, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> them cruel, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> them merry, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> them grim; <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> them dance, and heard them sing; <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> them tear their hair, and heard them howl. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> the air thick with them. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> them come and go, incessantly. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> them riding downward, soaring upward, sailing off afar, perching near at hand, all restless and all violently active. Stone, and brick, and slate, and tile, became transparent to him as to them. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> them in the houses, busy at the sleepers’ beds. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> them soothing people in their dreams; <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> them beating them with knotted whips; <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> them yelling in their ears; <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> them playing softest music on their pillows; <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> them cheering some with the songs of birds and the perfume of flowers; <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> them flashing awful faces on the troubled rest of others, from enchanted mirrors which they carried in their hands.|$|R

5|$|The {{captain had}} to record his survey in {{painstaking}} paperwork, and Darwin too kept a daily log {{as well as}} detailed notebooks of his finds and speculations, and a diary which became his journal. Darwin's notebooks show a complete professionalism that he had probably learnt at the University of Edinburgh when making natural history notes while exploring {{the shores of the}} Firth of Forth with his brother Erasmus in 1826 and studying marine invertebrates with Robert Edmund Grant for a few months in 1827. Darwin had also collected beetles at Cambridge, but he was a novice in all other areas of natural history. During the voyage Darwin investigated small invertebrates, while collecting specimens of other creatures for experts to examine and describe once the Beagle had returned to England. More than half of his carefully organised zoology notes deal with marine invertebrates, and the notes record closely reasoned interpretations of what he found about their complex internal anatomy while dissecting specimens under his microscope, and of little experiments on their response to stimulation. His onshore observations included intense, analytical comments on possible reasons for the behaviour, distribution, and relation to their environment of the creatures he <b>saw.</b> <b>He</b> made good use of the ship's excellent library of books on natural history, but continually questioned their correctness.|$|E

25|$|These sources, in {{contrast}} to those from the Tang period, refer to Shaolin methods of armed combat. This include the forte of Shaolin monks and for which they had become famous — the staff (gun); General Qi Jiguang included these techniques in his book, Treatise of Effective Discipline.

25|$|Arguably, had Stilwell {{been given}} the number of American regular {{infantry}} divisions he had continually requested, the American experience in China and Burma would have been very different. Certainly, his Army peers, Gen. Douglas MacArthur and Gen. George Marshall had the highest respect for his abilities, and both <b>saw</b> <b>he</b> replaced Gen. Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr. as commander of Tenth U.S. Army at Okinawa after the latter's death. During the last year of the war, however, the U.S. was strained to meet all its military obligations, and cargo aircraft diverted to supply Stilwell, the 14th Air Force, and the Chinese in the East left air-drop-dependent campaigns in the West, such as Operation Market Garden, woefully short of aircraft.|$|E
25|$|In March 1152, Louis VII and Eleanor of Aquitaine {{had their}} {{marriage}} annulled under {{the pretext of}} consanguinity at the council of Beaugency. The terms of the annulment left Eleanor as duchess of Aquitaine but still a vassal of Louis. Eight weeks later she married Henry, thus Henry became duke of Aquitaine and Gascony and count of Poitiers. Now Henry refused to give Anjou to his brother because it would mean splitting his land in two. A coalition of Henry's enemies was formed by Louis VII: Stephen of England and his son Eustace IV of Boulogne (married to Louis' sister); Henry I, Count of Champagne (betrothed to Louis' daughter), Robert of Dreux (Louis' brother) and Henry's brother, Geoffrey, who <b>saw</b> <b>he</b> wouldn't receive Anjou.|$|E

25|$|God's {{word came}} to Jeremiah {{to say that}} before God formed him in the womb, God knew him, sanctified him, and {{appointed}} him a prophet to the nations. Jeremiah protested {{that he could not}} speak, for he was a child, but God told him not to fear, for he would go wherever God would send him, say whatever God would command him to say, and God would be with him to deliver him. Then God touched Jeremiah's mouth and said that God had put words in his mouth and set him over the nations to root out and to pull down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant. God asked Jeremiah what he <b>saw,</b> <b>he</b> replied that he saw the rod of an almond tree, and God said that he had seen well, for God watches over God's word to perform it.|$|E
25|$|God's {{word came}} to Jeremiah {{a second time}} to ask what he <b>saw,</b> <b>he</b> replied that he saw a seething pot tipping from the north, and God said {{that out of the}} north evil would break forth upon all Israel. For God would call all the kingdoms of the north to come, and they would set their thrones at Jerusalem's gate, against its walls, and against the cities of Judah. God would utter God's {{judgments}} against Judah, as its people had forsaken God and worshipped the work of their own hands. God thus directed Jeremiah to gird his loins, arise, and speak to the Judean people all that God commanded, for God had made Jeremiah a fortified city, an iron pillar, and brazen walls against the land of Judah, its rulers, its priests, and its people. They would fight against him, but they would not prevail, for God would be with him to deliver him.|$|E

He is Michigan’s first All-American in five years. A 60-minute performer, seldom fooled by intricate maneuvers, Heikkinen is regarded by Coach Fritz Crisler as the finest guard he has ever seen.” The NEA said: “Ralph Heikkinen, Michigan senior and Ramsay, was small as guards go.

Myself, Jamie and Tony Discipline sat down and spoke about the scenes beforehand, discussing {{how we were going}} to perform them. It's like taking on a new project, so every time I get a new storyline, I'm hands-on and ready to go for it." [...] On the scenes involving Anthony, Tyler and Derek, Lapinskas said, [...] "I think it was definitely a shock for them to see his true colours!

500|$|Later, {{his style}} of {{scouting}} {{was used as a}} blueprint by scouts to evaluate players. He usually ignored the obvious tools such as ability to hit, size, speed, and human power, saying that [...] "any dope" [...] could see it. When he scouted a prospect, his top priority was checking that the subject could handle the pressure of playing Major League Baseball. When he got word of a promising player, he went to see him play. If Krichell liked what he <b>saw,</b> <b>he</b> discussed the player's goals and motivation with him and his family. He decided whether the player was ready for the Yankees or one of their farm teams to use. He tended to take a risk with players passed by other teams. He discounted some of a player's weaknesses if their remaining skills were up to par, for example with Tony Lazzeri, who was a poor fielder. Krichell also {{was one of the first}} to notice that intelligence mattered in a game filled with uneducated people. Most of his signings were college graduates who Krichell believed could take advantage of their ability to think.|$|E
500|$|The 1920-1930s {{have been}} called the Golden Age of Sports, and Tunis {{was right in the}} middle of much of it as a commentator, writer, and athlete, but he often criticized what he <b>saw.</b> <b>He</b> disliked the way the media was {{covering}} sports and its players. In the 1920s some sports promoters bribed newspapers for favorable coverage, [...] and he felt the media was glorifying the business and ignoring its problems. Tunis also believed that high salaries would destroy the pleasure and benefits sports brought the everyday player. His essay [...] "The Great God Football" [...] appeared in Harper's Magazine in 1928, attacking what he saw as the increasing commercialization of college football. The article became the center of a continuing controversy. A 2010 The Texas Observer cover story, titled The Golden Football: The University of Texas’ Bad Example, opens with a two-paragraph reference to Tunis' article, and concludes by referring the reader back to Tunis' 1928 description of college football as a [...] "first-class octopus strangling the legitimate pursuits of educational institutions." [...] "Who Owns Football?" [...] appeared in Sports Story Magazine in 1931, in 2012 John Dinan's Sports in the Pulp Magazines called it [...] "timeless".|$|E
500|$|Eaton's combat {{career began}} inauspiciously, {{when he was}} shot down three times in the space of ten days. On the first occasion, his P-40 Kittyhawk was hit by 20mm cannon shells from an enemy fighter that he never <b>saw.</b> <b>He</b> later recalled, [...] "I was too busy getting the kite down to be frightened. But my God was I surprised." [...] Eaton brought his {{crippled}} aircraft in for a forced landing at El Hamma—in the midst of a tank battle between German and New Zealand forces. After the fighting had died down he made his way over to the New Zealanders, who gave him a lift back to his air base. The second time he was shot down, his plane was struck by 88mm anti-aircraft fire, necessitating another crash landing, this time behind enemy lines. Sympathetic Arab tribesmen smuggled him past the Germans and back to his airfield. Two days later, his P-40 was hit by fire from an Me109 that dived at him from out of the sun. He was able to glide back to base, [...] away, but on arriving found that it was under attack by German bombers. He decided he had no other option than to land the damaged plane among the exploding bombs, and managed to do so without mishap. His series of narrow escapes engendered a spirit of fatalism, and a habit of keeping his emotions severely in check while on duty: [...] "I just couldn't see myself living when so many were dying.
