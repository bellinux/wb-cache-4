40|$|A user-oriented {{computer}} program, CAS 22, was developed that is applicable to aerodynamic analysis and transonic <b>shock-free</b> redesign of existing two-dimensional cascades of airfoils. This FORTRAN {{program can be}} used: (1) as an analysis code for full-potential, transonic, shocked or <b>shock-free</b> cascade flows; (2) as a design code for <b>shock-free</b> cascades that uses Sobieczky's fictitious-gas concept; and (3) as a <b>shock-free</b> design code followed automatically by the analysis in order {{to confirm that the}} newly obtained cascade shape provides for an entirely <b>shock-free</b> transonic flow field. A four-level boundary-conforming grid of an O type is generated. The <b>shock-free</b> design is performed by implementing Sobieczky's fictitious-gas concept of elliptic continuation from subsonic into supersonic flow domains. Recomputation inside each supersonic zone is performed by the method of characteristics in the rheograph plane by using isentropic gas relations. Besides converting existing cascade shapes with multiple shocked supersonic regions into <b>shock-free</b> cascades, CAS 22 can also unchoke previously choked cascades and make them shock free...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that presenting response-independent positive reinforcers reduces the response rate of an operant maintained by positive reinforcement. The present experiment investigated a similar effect using <b>shock-free</b> time as a negative reinforcer. Brief shocks were delivered {{in the presence of a}} distinctive stimulus, and pigeon's key pecks were reinforced by the occasional presentation of a 2 -minute <b>shock-free</b> period. Extra 2 -minute <b>shock-free</b> periods were added independently of behavior. For each of three pigeons, response rate during shock-on periods declined with added <b>shock-free</b> periods; the more frequently the extra <b>shock-free</b> periods occurred the greater the decline in response rate. This outcome is predicted by extending the Law of Effect to include negative reinforcement...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} {{for the design}} of <b>shock-free</b> {{supercritical}} airfoils, wings, and three-dimensional configurations is described.

They include modifications to part of the upper surface of an NACA 64 A 410 airfoil that will maintain <b>shock-free</b> flow over a range of Mach numbers for a fixed lift coefficient, and the modifications required on part of the upper surface of a swept wing with an NACA 64 A 410 root section to achieve <b>shock-free</b> flow. While the results are given for inviscid flow, the same procedures can be employed iteratively with a boundary layer calculation in order to achieve <b>shock-free</b> viscous designs. With a <b>shock-free</b> pressure field the boundary layer calculation will be reliable and not complicated by the difficulties of shock-wave boundary-layer interaction...|$|E
40|$|A {{computational}} method for designing <b>shock-free,</b> quasi-three-dimensional, transonic, turbomachinery blades is described. <b>Shock-free</b> designs are found by implementing Sobieczky's fictitious gas principle {{in the analysis}} of a baseline shape, resulting in an elliptic solution that is incorrect in the supersonic domain. <b>Shock-free</b> designs are obtained by combining the subsonic portion of this solution with a characteristic calculation of the correct supersonic flow using the sonic line data from the fictitious elliptic solution. This provides a new, <b>shock-free</b> blade design. Examples presented include the removal of shocks from two blades in quasi-three-dimensional flow {{and the development of a}} series of <b>shock-free</b> two-dimensional stators. The new designs all include modifications to the upper surface of an experimental stator blade developed at NASA Lewis Research Center. While the designs presented here are for inviscid flow, the same concepts have been successfully applied to the <b>shock-free</b> design of airfoils and three-dimensional wings with viscous effects. The extension of the present method to viscous flows is straightforward given a suitable analysis algorithm for the flow...|$|E

[Journal of the Acoustic Society of America, Nov. 1998] {{described}} {{the generation of}} <b>shock-free</b> high-amplitude pressure waves in closed cavities using large equipment and resonators to produce the reported effects.

40|$|In {{the absence}} of responding, pigeons were shocked under a variable-time schedule. Responses on either of two keys {{occasionally}} produced one minute of <b>shock-free</b> time. That is, pigeons' key pecks were reinforced with <b>shock-free</b> time under concurrent variable-interval schedules. The relative frequency {{of access to the}} one-minute <b>shock-free</b> periods was systematically manipulated. Pigeons tended to match both relative response rate and proportion of time spent on each key to the relative frequency of the <b>shock-free</b> periods. A best-fit linear regression equation accounted for over 95 % of the variance in both relative response rate and time allocation. The data paralleled closely the results of concurrent schedules of positive reinforcement. These findings are consistent with a description of reinforcement as a transition to a higher-valued situation and suggest that common laws govern choice for both positive and negative reinforcement...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} {{the limits of}} <b>shock-free</b> {{transonic}} airfoil design are explored via computational fluid dynamics and shape optimization. Using an inviscid flow solver coupled with the adjoint method for shape optimization, the best possible Mach number and lift coefficient combinations are determined for various airfoil sections. In addition, the effects of airfoil thickness and a trailing edge wedge are examined. Although <b>shock-free</b> solutions only occur for a singular Mach number and lift coefficient for a given airfoil shape, {{it is useful to}} know the best possible combination that can be attained. We have found that there is a band of attainable shock free solutions between a lift coefficient of 1. 0 at Mach 0. 72 and a lift coefficient of 0. 3 at Mach 0. 83. Also, we are able to shift the curve of attainable solutions outward by making the airfoil thinner and by adding a trailing edge wedge. Once a <b>shock-free</b> solution is found, the von Kármán transonic similarity rule can be used to determine <b>shock-free</b> solutions by changing airfoil thickness. In addition, the off-design performance of the shape optimized <b>shock-free</b> airfoils is examined, and the inviscid results are verified by using a viscous flow solver coupled with the adjoint method for shape optimization.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{assessed the}} relative aversiveness of different duration preshock (PS) signals (5 and 20 sec) and different duration stimuli identifying <b>shock-free</b> periods. In Exp I, the responding of 15 of 18 female Sprague-Dawley rats was maintained when it produced changes from a predictable-shock condition with a 5 -sec PS signal to an identical schedule with a 20 -sec PS signal; responding was not maintained when it produced the opposite changes. These results occurred with intershock intervals of both 120 and 240 sec. Exp II assessed whether changing to the 20 -sec schedule was maintained by {{properties of the}} PS signals identifying the shock periods or by properties of the stimuli identifying the <b>shock-free</b> periods. Four similar rats were given training with the 2 signaled schedules in an operant chamber and then later given off-baseline preference tests in a shuttlebox. When given a choice between PS signals, Ss chose the 5 -sec over the 20 -sec signals. However, when given a choice between stimuli identifying <b>shock-free</b> periods, Ss chose the stimulus identifying the shorter <b>shock-free</b> periods (i. e., the one previously correlated with the 20 -sec signals).

40|$|The <b>shock-free</b> flow of an inviscid, perfect gas in a duct {{of varying}} {{cross-section}} is investigated.

When a steady, <b>shock-free</b> flow is set up in such a duct, and the pressure at the entry, or the exit, of the duct is then lowered, or raised (in {{such a way that}} a shock wave is not formed immediately), then 'wave fronts ' are formed which separate the region of steady flow from the region of unsteady flow.

An Euler solution with self-induced oscillation and separation driven by a strong shock is contrasted with a <b>shock-free</b> solution whose separation is caused by numerical error.

40|$|We {{simulate}} <b>shock-free</b> {{and shocked}} viscous accretion flow onto {{a black hole}} in a two dimensional cylindrical geometry, where initial conditions were chosen from analytical solutions. The simulation code used the Lagrangian Total Variation Diminishing (LTVD) and remap routine, which enabled us to attain high accuracy in capturing shocks and to handle the angular momentum distribution correctly. Inviscid <b>shock-free</b> accretion disk solution produced a thick disk structure, while the viscous <b>shock-free</b> solution attained a Bondi-like structure, but in either case, no jet activity nor any QPO-like activity developed. The steady state shocked solution in the inviscid, as well as, in the viscous regime, matched theoretical predictions well. However, increasing viscosity renders the accretion shock unstable. Large amplitude shock oscillation is accompanied by intermittent, transient inner multiple shocks. Such oscillation of the inner part of disk is interpreted {{as the source of}} QPO in hard X-rays observed in micro-quasars. Strong shock oscillation induces strong episodic jet emission. The jets also showed existence of shocks, which are produced as one shell hits the preceding one. The periodicity of jets and shock oscillation were similar.

40|$|A {{computer}} code that generates <b>shock-free</b> transonic compressor cascade shapes while {{taking into account}} viscosity effects is developed. The mathematical model for the inviscid flow field is the full potential equation. The Kutta-Joukowski condition is satisfied by varying the free stream angle at downstream infinity.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that unsignaled shock may accelerate positively reinforced operant responding if each shock signals a subsequent <b>shock-free</b> period. In order to explore the boundary conditions of this effect, two experiments were performed. In Experiment 1, pairs of unsignaled shocks separated by 15, 30, 60, or 120 seconds resulted in suppressed responding during the briefest intershock interval, and in accelerated responding during the longer intervals. When the second shock in each pair signaled a <b>shock-free</b> period of at least 3 minutes, accelerated responding also followed offset of the second shock in all but the 30 -second condition. In Experiment 2, the addition of a conditioned stimulus prior to each pair of shocks restored baseline responding, and eliminated accelerative control following the second shock only under the briefest inter-shock interval. The results are discussed in terms of the similarity between autocontingencies (shock/no-shock relations; Davis, Memmott, & Hurwitz, 1975) and recent modifications of the feature-positive procedure (e. g., Reberg & Memmott, 1979), which stress stimulus control by shock/no-shock relationships...|$|E
