The goal of the government is to minimize {{the time it takes}} to reach the appropriate product quality level at low costs. We simulate a dynamic profit maximization problem of the firm and derive the optimal path of the product quality development, then test the efficiency of the three types of <b>subsidy</b> methods: Constant <b>Subsidy,</b> Quality Matching <b>Subsidy</b> and Time-limited <b>Subsidy</b> methods.

Recent laboratory and field experiments contradict these straightforward predictions of standard economic theory: subjects consistently make decisions that result in larger amounts going to the charity under a matching <b>subsidy</b> than under an equivalent rebate <b>subsidy.</b> This paper tests whether this result is due to rebate-aversion – a preference by donors for a match over a rebate <b>subsidy.</b> Consistent with theory we find no significant preference for one or the other <b>subsidy</b> scheme.

40|$|To motivate {{more people}} to {{participate}} in vaccination campaigns, various <b>subsidy</b> policies are often supplied by government and the health sectors. However, these external incentives may also alter the vaccination decisions of the broader public, and hence the choice of incentive needs to be carefully considered. Since human behavior and the networking-constrained interactions among individuals significantly impact the evolution of an epidemic, here we consider the voluntary vaccination on human contact networks. To this end, two categories of typical <b>subsidy</b> policies are considered: (1) under the free <b>subsidy</b> policy, {{the total amount of}} <b>subsidy</b> is distributed to a certain fraction of individual and who are vaccinated without personal cost, and (2) under the partial-offset <b>subsidy</b> policy, each vaccinated person is offset by a certain amount of <b>subsidy.</b> A vaccination decision model based on evolutionary game theory is established to study the effects of these different <b>subsidy</b> policies on disease control. Simulations suggest that, because the partial-offset <b>subsidy</b> policy encourages {{more people to}} take vaccination, its performance is significantly better than that of the free <b>subsidy</b> policy. However, an interesting phenomenon emerges in the partial-offset scenario: with limited amount of total <b>subsidy,</b> a moderate <b>subsidy</b> rate for each vaccinated individual can guarantee the group-optimal vaccination, leading to the maximal social benefits, while such an optimal phenomenon is not evident for the free <b>subsidy</b> scenario.
