5|$|An {{important}} function of enzymes {{is in the}} digestive systems of animals. Enzymes such as amylases and proteases break down large molecules (<b>starch</b> or proteins, respectively) into smaller ones, {{so they can be}} absorbed by the intestines. <b>Starch</b> molecules, for example, are too large to be absorbed from the intestine, but enzymes hydrolyze the <b>starch</b> chains into smaller molecules such as maltose and eventually glucose, which can then be absorbed. Different enzymes digest different food substances. In ruminants, which have herbivorous diets, microorganisms in the gut produce another enzyme, cellulase, to break down the cellulose cell walls of plant fiber.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{ingredients}} of beer are water; a <b>starch</b> source, such as malted barley, {{able to be}} saccharified (converted to sugars) then fermented (converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide); a brewer's yeast to produce the fermentation; and a flavouring such as hops. A mixture of <b>starch</b> sources may be used, with a secondary <b>starch</b> source, such as maize (corn), rice or sugar, often being termed an adjunct, especially when used as a lower-cost substitute for malted barley.

The size of 90 % of particles among the <b>starches</b> was below 15 to 58 μm, while that of the flour was below 133 μm. Larval length, head capsule width, and weight gain of T. castaneum were measured by rearing larvae on <b>starches,</b> flour, and flour plus 5 % (by wt) Brewer’s yeast diet for 30 d at 28 oC and 65 % r. h.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century the idea that plants could {{synthesise}} almost all their tissues from atmospheric gases had not yet emerged. The energy component of photosynthesis, the capture and storage of the Sun's radiant energy in carbon bonds (a process on which all life depends) was first elucidated in 1847 by Mayer, but the details of how this was done would take many more years. Chlorophyll was named in 1818 and its chemistry gradually determined, to be finally resolved in the early 20th century. The mechanism of photosynthesis remained a mystery until the mid-19th century when Sachs, in 1862, noted that <b>starch</b> was formed in green cells only in the presence of light and in 1882 he confirmed carbohydrates as the starting point for all other organic compounds in plants. The connection between the pigment chlorophyll and <b>starch</b> production was finally made in 1864 but tracing the precise biochemical pathway of <b>starch</b> formation did not begin until about 1915.|$|E

Modification with the two types of reagents resulted in significant difference in physical properties of the <b>starches.</b> The investigation on the chemical fine structure of modified <b>starches</b> suggested that the distribution of acetyl groups over both the amylose and amylopectin populations of the <b>starches</b> was different, not only at molecular level but also at granular level...|$|R
40|$|Annealing {{tone and}} two step) {{slightly}} decreased the susceptibility of potato <b>starches</b> to acid hydrolysis (lintnerisation, 2. 2 M HCl, 35 degrees C); however, it hardly affected that of wheat and pea <b>starches.</b> Annealing {{had a very}} pronounced effect on DSC gelatinisation of wheat, potato and pea starches: endothermic peaks narrowed and shifted to a higher temperature. However, already after 10. 5 h of acid hydrolysis, differences in DSC transition temperatures and peak widths between native, one step and two step annealed <b>starches</b> became much smaller and almost disappeared after further hydrolysis, indicating a substantial contribution of the amorphous regions to annealing. The observation that 7 -day lintnerised wheat and pea <b>starches</b> were less susceptible to annealing than the corresponding 24 -h lintnerised <b>starches</b> supported this view. No changes in chain length distribution were observed between lintnerised (20 days) native and annealed potato <b>starches</b> and between lintnerised (7 days) native and annealed pea <b>starches.</b> For all other lintnerised <b>starches,</b> the distribution profiles showed a higher average degree of polymerisation (DP), and a slightly higher ratio of singly branched (DP 22 - 30) to short linear (DP 10 - 18) chains (except for 20 -day lintnerised pea <b>starches!</b> for the annealed than for the corresponding native <b>starches.</b> This indicates that, {{as a result of}} annealing, the amylopectin branch points become more resistant to acid attack. From the above, it was concluded that the amorphous parts in the granule indeed {{play an important role in}} the molecular mechanism(s) of annealing, but that structural changes within crystalline parts may also take place.

Maize, wheat, RS 2 and RS 4 <b>starches</b> were MW-treated according to a 2 × 2 experimental design (300 and 600 W of power, 30 and 150 s of time). The changes of in vitro digestibility, rheological properties (rapid visco analyser, RVA) and near infrared (NIR) spectroscopic characteristic were studied. Two spectrophotometers were applied (dispersive and Fourier-transform (FT)) to compare their sensitivity in the analysis of the MW-treated <b>starches.</b> Results showed that the digestibility of <b>starches</b> did not show any tendencies when increasing the microwave energy of treatments, the characteristics of the kinetic curves remained unchanged. The RVA analysis showed that the RSs did not gelatinize after the heat-treatments. The MW heating weakened the rheological properties of all <b>starches.</b> The NIR analysis was the most sensitive device for the detection of the effects of MW treatments.
