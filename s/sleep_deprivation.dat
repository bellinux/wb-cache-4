A sleep deficit is not instantly reduced by one night's sleep; it may take two or three conventional sleep cycles for an individual to return to unimpaired performance.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} test {{predictions}} of the 2 -process model of sleep regulation, the effects of slow wave <b>sleep</b> (SWS) <b>deprivation</b> by acoustic stimulation during {{the first part of}} the sleep period on EEG power density and sleep duration were investigated in 2 experiments. In the first experiment, 8 subjects were deprived of SWS during the first 5 h of a baseline nocturnal sleep period without awakening. Compared to the same interval of undisturbed sleep, power densities in the delta frequencies were attenuated. In the hour following SWS deprivation, power densities in the delta and theta frequencies were considerably enhanced in comparison with the same interval of undisturbed sleep. No change in sleep duration was observed. In the second experiment, 8 subjects were sleep deprived for 1 night and recovery sleep was initiated at 11 a. m. on 2 occasions. In 1 condition subjects were deprived of SWS during the first 3 h of recovery sleep. In the other condition recovery sleep was not experimentally disturbed. During undisturbed recovery sleep, power densities in the delta and theta frequencies were higher than during baseline <b>sleep.</b> During SWS <b>deprivation,</b> power densities in this frequency range were lower than during undisturbed recovery sleep. In the hour following SWS deprivation, power densities were enhanced relative to the same interval of undisturbed recovery <b>sleep.</b> Again, SWS <b>deprivation</b> did not cause an increase of sleep duration. The observed changes in EEG power density support the hypothesis that this EEG parameter reflects the homeostatic process S. The absence of an increase in sleep duration after SWS deprivation, however, contradicts the hypothesized causal role of this process in the regulation of sleep length. ...|$|R

Complex feedback loops involving cytokines, such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α produced in response to infection, appear to {{also play a role}} in the regulation of non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Thus the immune response to infection may result in changes to the sleep cycle, including an increase in slow-wave sleep relative to REM sleep.|$|E

Manson, Trent Reznor and frequent Nine Inch Nails mixer Sean Beavan produced the record, alongside former Skinny Puppy member and longtime producer Dave Ogilvie. The process of creating the album was reputedly a long and difficult one, highlighted by experiments involving <b>sleep</b> <b>deprivation,</b> near-constant drug use, as well as self-harm, with Manson indicating that he would regularly insert sewing needles underneath his own fingernails.

40|$|The {{relation}} between EEG power density during slow wave <b>sleep</b> (SWS) <b>deprivation</b> and power density during subsequent sleep was investigated. Nine young male adults {{slept in the}} laboratory for 3 consecutive nights. Spectral analysis of the EEG on the 2 nd (baseline) night revealed an exponential decline in mean EEG power density (0. 25 - 15. 0 Hz) over successive nonrapid eye movement - {{rapid eye movement sleep}} cycles. During the first 3 h of the 3 rd night the subjects were deprived of SWS by means of acoustic stimuli, which did not induce wakefulness. During SWS deprivation an attenuation of EEG power densities was observed in the delta frequencies, {{as well as in the}} theta band. In the hours of <b>sleep</b> following SWS <b>deprivation</b> both the power densities in the frequency range from 1 to 7 Hz and the amount of SWS were enhanced, relative to the same period of the baseline night. Both the amount of EEG energy accumulating subsequent to SWS deprivation and its time course could be predicted accurately from the EEG energy deficit caused by SWS deprivation. The data show that the level of integral EEG power density during a certain period after sleep onset depends on the amount of EEG energy accumulated during the preceding sleep rather than on the time elapsed since sleep onset. In terms of the two-process model of sleep regulation this finding indicates that EEG power density reflects the rate of decay of the regulating variable, S, rather than S itself, as was originally postulated. ...|$|R
5|$|Daily {{routine of}} life in the {{trenches}} began with the morning 'stand-to'. An hour before dawn everyone was roused and ordered to man their positions to guard against a dawn raid by the Germans. With stand-to over, {{it was time for the}} men to have breakfast and perform ablutions. Once complete, the NCOs would assign daily chores, before the men attended to the cleaning of rifles and equipment, filling sandbags, repairing trenches or digging latrines. Once the daily tasks had been completed the men who were off-duty would find a place to sleep. Due to the constant bombardments and the sheer effort of trying to stay alive, <b>sleep</b> <b>deprivation</b> was common. Soldiers also had to take it in turns to be on sentry duty, watching for enemy movements.|$|E

5|$|The {{hypothalamus}} in the diencephalon, {{is involved}} in regulating many functions of the body. Functions include neuroendocrine regulation, regulation of the circadian rhythm, control of the autonomic nervous system, and the regulation of fluid, and food intake. The circadian rhythm is controlled by two main cell groups in the hypothalamus. The anterior hypothalamus includes the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus which through gene expression cycles, generates a roughly 24 hour circadian clock. In the circadian day an ultradian rhythm takes control of the sleeping pattern. Sleep is an essential requirement for the body and brain and allows the closing down and resting of the body's systems. There are also findings that suggest that the daily build-up of toxins in the brain are removed during sleep. Whilst awake the brain consumes {{a fifth of the}} body’s total energy needs. Sleep necessarily reduces this use and gives time for the restoration of energy-giving ATP. The effects of <b>sleep</b> <b>deprivation</b> show the absolute need for sleep.|$|E

40|$|Spindle activity, {{visually}} {{scored in}} the 12 - 15 Hz range over antero-posterior midline derivations, has been assessed in ten normal subjects during a baseline and a recovery sleep after 2 nights of selective slow-wave <b>sleep</b> (SWS) <b>deprivation.</b> The recovery <b>sleep,</b> characterized by a significant increase of stage 4 and SWS {{as compared to the}} baseline, revealed that sleep spindles are reduced in the first NREM sleep cycle. The size of this reduction in spindle density progressively decreased {{in the course of the}} night, paralleling the depletion of SWS rebound. Topographical distribution of spindle activity showed a global linear increase over consecutive NREM-REM sleep cycles, regarding to the whole antero-posterior midline EEG derivations except the occipital one. It is concluded that the SWS rebound after 2 nights of selective SWS deprivation is associated with a reduction of spindles during stage 2. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|SummaryGranule cells (GCs) in {{the mouse}} {{olfactory}} bulb (OB) {{continue to be}} generated in adulthood, with nearly half incorporated and the remainder eliminated.

This enhanced GC apoptosis occurred in association with postprandial behaviors that included grooming, resting, and sleeping, and was particularly correlated with the length of postprandial <b>sleep.</b> Further, <b>deprivation</b> of olfactory sensory experience in the local OB area potentiated the extent of GC elimination in that area during the postprandial period. Sensory experience-dependent enhancement of GC elimination also occurred during postprandial period under natural feeding condition. These results suggest that extensive structural reorganization of bulbar circuitry occurs during the postprandial period, reflecting sensory experience during preceding waking period...|$|R

40|$|Paradoxical <b>sleep</b> (PS) <b>deprivation</b> {{has been}} {{suggested}} to induce supersensitivity of postsynaptic dopamine (DA) receptors and subsensitivity of acetylcholine (ACh) receptors. Yawning behavior is reduced after PS deprivation and is believed to result from an interaction between ACh and DA systems. Concomitant treatment of PS deprived animals with DA agonists reverses PS deprivation effects on stereotypy and aggressiveness. To examine this possibility on yawning behavior, rats were treated, during the deprivation period, with atropine, methamphetamine, haloperidol or distilled water. Following PS deprivation, rats were injected with apomorphine or pilocarpine and number of yawns was recorded. Atropine increased yawning of PS deprived rats induced by pilocarpine, but not by apomorphine. Treatment with methamphetamine and haloperidol did not change PS deprivation effect on pilocarpine- and apomorphine-induced yawning. the data suggest that reversal of PS deprivation-induced yawning inhibition is mediated distinctly by both acetylcholine and dopamine systems.

40|$|Homeostatic and {{circadian}} {{processes are}} basic mechanisms of human sleep which challenge the common knowledge of large individual variations in sleep need or differences in circadian types. However, since sleep research has mostly focused on group measures, an approach which emphasizes {{the similarities between}} subjects, the biological foundations of the individual differences in normal sleep are still poorly understood. In the present work, we assessed individual differences {{in a range of}} EEG frequencies including sigma activity during non-REM sleep (8. 0 - 15. 5 Hz range) in a group of 10 subjects who had participated in a slow-wave <b>sleep</b> (SWS) <b>deprivation</b> study. We showed that, like a "fingerprint", a particular topographic distribution of the electroencephalogram (EEG) power along the antero-posterior cortical axis distinguishes each individual during non-REM sleep. This individual EEG-trait is substantially invariant across six consecutive nights characterized by large experimentally induced changes of sleep architecture. One possible hypothesis is that these EEG invariances can be related to individual differences in genetically determined functional brain anatomy, rather than to sleep-dependent mechanisms.
