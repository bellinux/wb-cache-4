50|$|The <b>shaft</b> <b>collar</b> is a simple, yet important, machine {{component}} {{found in many}} power transmission applications, most notably motors and gearboxes. The collars are used as mechanical stops, locating components, and bearing faces. The simple design lends itself to easy installation. Many people will be familiar with shaft collars through using Meccano.|$|E
50|$|Shaft collars saw few {{improvements}} until 1910 through 1911, when William G. Allen and Howard T. Hallowell, Sr, working independently, introduced {{commercially viable}} {{hex socket head}} set screws, and Hallowell patented a <b>shaft</b> <b>collar</b> with this safety-style set screw. His safety set collar was soon copied by others and became an industry standard. The invention of the safety set collar {{was the beginning of}} the recessed-socket screw industry.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of a lack}} of capital, {{the company}} was reconstituted in 1896 as the Brilliant Deep Levels Gold Mining Company. The shaft was then carried to 2,250 ft where the lode was intersected, but it was not payable. An {{explosion}} of dynamite of Christmas Day 1896 damaged the <b>shaft</b> <b>collar</b> throwing 30 men out of work. An underlie shaft had been driven to 2,615 ft but no payable ore was found and operations were suspended in 1904 due to difficulty in ventilating the shafts.|$|E
5000|$|The first mass-produced <b>shaft</b> <b>collars</b> {{were set}} screw collars and were used {{primarily}} on line shafting in early manufacturing mills. These early <b>shaft</b> <b>collars</b> were solid ring types, employing square-head set screws that protruded from the collar. Protruding screws {{proved to be}} a problem because they could catch on a worker's clothing while rotating on a shaft, and pull them into the machinery.|$|R
50|$|A further {{refinement}} of <b>shaft</b> <b>collars</b> {{is where a}} single bolt and nut surrounds the shaft. The bolt (exterior thread) has kerf cuts, making fingers, which are compressed onto the shaft as a nut is tightened over it. These are found on modern tripod legs and collets. If wrench-tightened, these can be very tight.|$|R
50|$|Clamp-style <b>shaft</b> <b>collars</b> are {{designed}} {{to solve the problems}} associated with the set-screw collar. They come in one- and two-piece designs. Instead of protruding into the shaft, the screws act to compress the collar and lock it into place. The ease of use is maintained with this design and there is no shaft damage. Since the screws compress the collar, a uniform distribution of force is imposed on the shaft, leading to a holding power that is nearly twice that of set-screw collars.|$|R
50|$|At {{ground level}} beneath {{and around the}} {{headframe}} is the <b>Shaft</b> <b>Collar</b> (also called the Bank or Deck), which provides the foundation necessary to support {{the weight of the}} headframe and provides a means for men, materials and services to enter and exit the shaft. Collars are usually massive reinforced concrete structures with more than one level. If the shaft is used for mine ventilation, a plenum space or casing is incorporated into the collar to ensure the proper flow of air {{into and out of the}} mine.|$|E
50|$|Firstly, {{the vehicle}} is {{reversed}} up to the drawbar of the trailer/dolly, stopping short of hitting. The height of the drawbar is checked, and adjusted accordingly. The safety catch handle on the upper left of the Ringfeder is pulled out and turned 90 degrees, and then allowed to return into the upper detent on the <b>shaft</b> <b>collar.</b> This then allows the actuator handle {{on the right of}} the body to be lifted to the stop. This pulls the bolt upwards, and sets the automatic tripping function. The Ringfeder is now ready to be coupled.|$|E
50|$|The site {{contains}} a steel headframe of asymmetrical design {{which is located}} over a timbered shaft. Erosion of the <b>shaft</b> <b>collar</b> has fully exposed one of the concrete footings of the headframe. A mullock dump is located immediately west of the headframe. East of the headframe is an open-sided engine shed of corrugated iron on a timber and steel frame, containing a winding engine on a brick mount and a large four- cylinder MAN diesel engine with a Vickers generator. The engine shed also {{contains a}} compressor and marble slab electrical switchboard. A security fence has recently been erected around the engine shed.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{innovative}} and useful of the collars is the two-piece clamping <b>collar.</b> Two-piece clamp-style <b>shaft</b> <b>collars</b> can be disassembled or installed in position without having to remove other components from the shaft. The two-piece design provides greater clamping force than a single piece clamp {{because all of the}} force is transferred directly into clamping the shaft. In single piece designs, the non-tightened side provides negative force as it must hold the collar open to allow it to be placed onto the shaft. The single tightener must work against this force as well as provide clamping force of its own.|$|R
5000|$|In 1901 Frank Hornby, a clerk from Liverpool, England, invented and {{patented}} a new toy called [...] "Mechanics Made Easy" [...] {{that was}} based on the principles of mechanical engineering. It was a model construction kit consisting of perforated metal strips, plates and girders, with wheels, pulleys, gears, <b>shaft</b> <b>collars</b> and axles for mechanisms and motion, and nuts and bolts and set screws to connect the pieces. The perforations were at a standard ½ inch (12.7 mm) spacing, the axles were 8-gauge, and the nuts and bolts used 5/32 inch BSW threads. The only tools required to assemble models were a screwdriver and spanners (wrenches). It {{was more than just a}} toy: it was educational, teaching basic mechanical principles like levers and gearing.|$|R
50|$|Early screw-propelled steamships used a {{thrust block}} or thrust box {{composed}} of perhaps a dozen lower-rated plain thrust journal bearings stacked {{on the same}} shaft. These were problematic in service: they were bulky, difficult to dismantle, wasted power through friction {{and they had a}} tendency to overheat. The thrust box was built of a box-like cast iron housing with a radial bearing at each end and a number of collars formed on the shaft between them. This shaft was often a short section of removable shaft called the thrust shaft, linking the engine ahead to the propeller shaft astern. A series of iron horseshoe-shaped collars fitted over the small diameter of the shaft and bore against the forward face of the <b>shaft's</b> <b>collars.</b> Each horseshoe was faced with a low-friction pad of babbitt metal. Lubrication was by an oil bath in the box and a plentiful volume was important for cooling purposes too.|$|R
50|$|During the 1970s {{exploration}} drilling {{confirmed that the}} reef continued at least another 200 metres below the old workings. By 1991 the old Hart <b>Shaft</b> <b>collar</b> had been re-established and water pumped out to 160 metres deep. The project was suspended until 1992 when the mine's owners changed. Deep drilling resumed in 1993 to review the resource estimates and, from 1994, the Beaconsfield Mine Joint Venture has carried out drilling of the depth extension of the Tasmania Reef. A permanent stage pumping station 181 m below ground has been lowering {{the water in the}} shaft since August 1995. The permanent winder and head frame were completed in January 1996 and the shaft finished in late 1996. An ore treatment plant was built during the 1999/2000 financial year.|$|E
50|$|In June 1971, a {{new steel}} {{headframe}} was {{built over the}} <b>shaft</b> <b>collar</b> with a cross head made up {{to run in the}} main shaft. It is not known what the cross head was supporting. The air winch was repositioned and a winch house almost directly west of the main shaft was made. Extra timber and lagging was placed at the entrance of the mine shaft due to fears of falling rocks. Safety concerns also led to replacement of the old pulley-sheave with a new gin-wheel. Ladder ways and timbering in the shafts were substantially upgraded as most had split due to water logging. Most of the metal infrastructure such as pipe work and bolts had corroded due to their long period of saturation, and were replaced.|$|E
50|$|Rider Vein can be {{followed}} east from White Grit towards {{the trees on}} the hilltop. Three blocked shafts without names are encountered before Blue Pit, situated in a large spoil tip. On the way up, the unique circular magazine is passed on the right. Blue Pit is filled but the vein can {{be followed}} further up the hill, past some opencast workings and a collapsed shaft, to Rider Shaft {{on the other side of}} the fence. This small square shaft is open and is situated in a large spoil tip, which bears a circular depression which may mark the position of a horse gin. Rider Shaft has been measured in the past as 200 ft to water, which suggests that Wood Level is backed up (calculated depth is 230 ft below Rider <b>Shaft</b> <b>collar).</b> It was descended in 1994 to a blockage (including a dead cow) at 130 ft. At 100 ft there is a level off the shaft but this has collapsed after 5 ft.|$|E
40|$|Shape-memory-materials show good {{actuating}} properties {{based on}} their high reversible strain potential. The implicit positioning range can profitably be used in micro machines, if detachable connections between shape-memory-elements and adjacent steel-components are sufficiently realized. In this paper theoretical approaches to describe the design principles of the <b>shaft</b> to <b>collar</b> connections are followed by experimental validation of clamping and pressfit connections. The variation of the preload for clamping connections can be predicted if the temperature-dependent elasticity of the shape-memory element is known. The experimental results for longitudinal pressfit connections match the extended theoretical elastic plastic model. The load transfer is characterized by considerable slip between <b>shaft</b> and <b>collar</b> even if small loads are applied. This results in huge hysteresis for cyclic loading. The evaluation of the surface appearance confirms the necessity of the calculated large joint length. Dependent on the temperature and the micro structure of the shape-memory-component different wear mechanisms are of major importance. (orig.)

5000|$|Headless {{set screws}} {{have been around}} for a long time, with the {{straight}} slot being the oldest drive type (due to its ease of machining), but the demand for headless set screws experienced a marked increase in the first and second decades of the 20th century, when a penchant for better industrial safety, a campaign with the slogan [...] "safety first", swept the industrialized nations of North America and Europe as a part of the larger Progressive Movement. This surge in safety consciousness was a backlash against the often-atrocious industrial safety standards of the era. H.T. Hallowell, Sr., a U.S. industrialist whose corporation was one of several that pioneered the commercialization of the hex socket drive, noted in his memoir that line shafting, which was [...] in the industrial practice of the time, often had headed set screws (with external-wrenching square drive) holding the many pulleys to the line <b>shafts,</b> and <b>collars</b> holding the <b>shafts</b> from axial movement. Gear trains of exposed gears were also common at the time, and those, too, often used headed set screws, holding the gears to the shafts. His company's chief products at the time were shaft hangers and <b>shaft</b> <b>collars</b> of pressed-steel construction. The [...] "safety craze" [...] created a burgeoning demand for headless set screws on pulleys, gears, and collars to replace the headed ones, so that workers' clothing and fingers were less likely to catch on the exposed rotating screw head. It was this heightened demand that prompted Hallowell's firm to get into the screw-making business and to explore socket-head drive designs. With P.L. Robertson holding fresh patent rights on a practical-to-make square-socket drive, the firm soon pursued the hex socket drive.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{research}} facility {{has been designed}} and manufactured to study performance characteristics of industrial hydrodynamic thrust bearings. The facility includes a test rig containing two identical tilting pad thrust bearings operating against separate <b>collars.</b> A <b>shaft</b> supported by two journal bearings is driven by a 143 kW variable-speed d. c. motor. The bearings are tested in a balanced pair to accommodate the substantial axial force generated by hydraulic cylinders. Bearing instrumentation encompasses a distribution of thermocouples, pressure transducers and oil-®lm thickness sensors of eddy current type. Two piezoelectric transducers for pressure pro®le measurements and three thermistors are mounted {{in one of the}} <b>shaft</b> <b>collars.</b> Additional instrumentation includes thermocouples, pressure sensors, ¯owmeters, a load cell and inductive sensors. Signals from all sensors are logged by a personal computer-based high-speed data acquisition system that acquires the measured data, conditions them and presents the results on line. Power losses are obtained by monitoring bearing friction torque and by the calorimetric technique. A detailed description of the {{research facility}} is provided together with some representative results of equalizing tilting pad thrust bearing performance obtained for the steady state and transient operating conditions...|$|R
50|$|The Galena mine has a {{long history}} dating back to 1887. However, recent mining began in 1953 by ASARCO, in an effort to explore and exploit {{outcrops}} of silver-lead ore. At that time a shaft was sunk to the 3000 level (3000 feet below the <b>shaft</b> <b>collar)</b> and lateral or level drifts were excavated on the 2800 and 3000 levels. The level drifts accessed down dip projections of the silver-lead ore from above. The development on these levels included, drifting on ore and excavation of raises between the 2800 and 3000 levels and some diamond drilling. The “lead ore” was ready for production in 1953 when a drift crew on the east end of the 3000 level exposed a wide siderite-tetrahedrite-chalcopyrite vein that assayed over 50 ounces per ton silver. ASARCO abandoned the silver-lead development and focused on this new high grade discovery. The new discovery was called the Silver vein and has been the largest vein found at the Galena to date with estimated production of over 100 million ounces of silver at averages grades of over 20 ounces per ton. From 1953 until present, all exploration, development and production has been focused on the tetrahedrite silver-copper ores.|$|E
50|$|When {{the mine}} ceased {{production}} in 1945, the Quincy Number 2 shaft was the world's longest mine shaft, at 9,260 feet (2.82 km or 1.75 miles) along the dip of the deposit on a 55 degree decline. (measured vertically from the <b>shaft</b> <b>collar,</b> the depth is 6,200 feet.) To {{raise and lower}} ore and workers into this shaft, the world's largest steam-driven mine hoist was built in 1918 and housed in the Quincy Number 2 Hoist House. The Nordberg Steam Hoist and its reinforced concrete building, built in the Georgian architectural style with brick veneer and Italian-tiled walls, cost over $370,000 in 1918 but was used for only eleven years until it ceased usage in 1929. Weighing more than 880 tons, it lifted 10 tons of ore at 36.4 miles per hour, thus saving $16,080 in fuel bills {{in its first year}} of operation. The hoist sat on the largest concrete slab ever poured, containing 3200 cu. yards of concrete and over 8 tons of reinforcement material. The Number 2 Hoist House was built as a reinforced concrete structure on a scale rare for 1918, {{making it one of the}} first of its kind The very decorative Hoist House was used as a showpiece for visiting investors.|$|E

40|$|Harness in Antiquity: The Prestige of Scientific Error. The work of Commander Lefebvre des Noettes and {{particular}} his hypothesis of the defectiveness of ancient harnesses, was very influential {{even though his}} analysis was technically false. After having situated the commander- a local erudite who took advantage of his early retirement to specialize {{in an area that}} had been little explored up until that time- in historical context, this article takes up the refutations that began in 1960 and became especially forceful due to the work of J. Spruytte in 1977. There was not one, but rather several ancient harnesses and the evolution towards modern techniques (<b>shafts,</b> <b>collars,</b> and breast harnesses) began in Antiquity. The commander's theories were accepted for so long and their refutation so little recognized in France because they reinforced the idea of "antiquity's technical block". The paper investi gates the birth of this concept and the reasons why it encountered so much success in France. The evolution of different historical schools giving special place to ancient history allows us to better understand why people pondered the causes of "technical block" without throwing the concept itself into question. It is as if ancient history had to have particular status and could not be considered part of the long procession of history. Amouretti Marie-Claire. L'attelage dans l'Antiquité.

40|$|In the Mechatronics laboratory, work {{is being}} done to develop methods for robot {{collision}} avoidance. A vital component of the project is motion detection and tracking. Currently, 3 d-imaging software and hardware are employed, but this technique carries the drawbacks of blind spots in the environment. Since the camera is placed directly above the robot, there are blind spots underneath the robot, which are a major problem. The idea is for the robot to work side-by-side to a human counterpart, which would allow for quicker assembly of parts. But, with the current visual system, the robot would be unable to detect limbs that may maneuver underneath its linkages. This is an obvious problem. In this thesis, an automated rotary vision system attachable to each linkage of the robot is being proposed. By attaching cameras directly to the robot, we will have the increased ability to eliminate blind spots and detect objects in the environment. The proposed assembly involves a four-piece clamp-on <b>shaft</b> <b>collar.</b> Two parts will clamp to the linkages while the other two clamp around enabling free rotation. In testing, this proposed solution was able to track and detect, but it has drawbacks of increased weight to linkages and speed of image processing.

The inside hollow shapes, as e. g. circular cross-sections, <b>shaft</b> to <b>collar</b> connections such as spherical triangles, polygons, splines or dovetail forms are manufactured with a shaping mandrel.

40|$|Achnanthes longipes is a marine, {{biofouling}} diatom that {{adheres to}} surfaces via adhesive polymers extruded during motility or organized into structures called stalks that contain three distinct regions: the pad, <b>shaft,</b> and <b>collar.</b> Four monoclonal antibodies (AL.

50|$|On a {{conventional}} rear-drive transmission, {{there are three}} basic shafts; the input, the output, and the countershaft. The input and output together are called the mainshaft, since they are joined inside the transmission so {{they appear to be}} a single shaft, although they rotate totally independently of each other. The input length of this shaft is much shorter than the output shaft. Parallel to the mainshaft is the countershaft. There are a number of gears fixed along the countershaft, and matching gears along the output shaft, although these are not fixed, and rotate independently of the output shaft. There are sliding dog collars, or dog clutches, between the gears on the output shaft, and to engage a gear to the <b>shaft,</b> the <b>collar</b> slides into the space between the shaft and the inside space of the gear, thus rotating the shaft as well. One collar is usually mounted between two gears, and slides both ways to engage one or the other gears, so on a four-speed there would be two collars. A front-drive transmission is basically the same, but may be simplified. There often are two shafts, the input and the output, but depending on the direction of rotation of the engine, three may be required. Rather than the input shaft driving the countershaft with a pinion gear, the input shaft takes over the countershaft's job, and the output shaft runs parallel to it. The gears are positioned and engaged just as they are on the countershaft and output shaft of a rear-drive. This merely eliminates one major component, the pinion gear. Part of the reason that the input and output are in-line on a rear drive unit is to relieve torsional stress on the transmission and mountings, but this isn't an issue in a front-drive as the gearbox is integrated into the transaxle.|$|R

5000|$|SPS at {{the time}} was a {{prominent}} maker of <b>shaft</b> hangers and <b>collars,</b> the latter of which were set in place with set screws. In pursuit of headless set screws with a better drive than a straight slot, Hallowell said, SPS had sourced set screws of square-socket drive from Britain, but they were very expensive. (This was only 2 years after Robertson's Canadian patent.) This cost problem drove SPS to purchase its first screw machine and make its screws in-house, which soon led to SPS's foray into fastener sales (for which it later became well known within the metalworking industries). Hallowell said that [...] "for a while we experimented with a screw containing a square hole like the British screw but soon found these would not be acceptable in this country U.S.. Then we decided to incorporate a hexagon socket into the screw …." [...] Hallowell does not elaborate on why SPS found that the square hole [...] "would not be acceptable in this country", but it seems likely that it would have to have involved licensing Robertson's patent, which would have defeated SPS's purpose of driving down its cost for internal-wrenching screws (and may have been unavailable at any price, as explained at [...] "List of screw drives > Robertson"). The story, if any, of whether SPS's methods required licensing of Allen's 1910 patent is not addressed by Hallowell's memoir. The book does not mention which method—cold forming or linear broaching—was used by SPS in these earliest years. If the latter was used, then Allen's patent would not have been relevant.|$|R
