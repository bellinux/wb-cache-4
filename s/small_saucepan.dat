5000|$|Saucepans (or just [...] "pots") are vessels with {{vertical}} sides {{about the}} same height as their diameter, used for simmering or boiling. Saucepans generally have one long handle. Larger pots of the same shape generally have two handles close {{to the sides of}} the pot (so they can be lifted with both hands), and are called sauce-pots or soup pots (3-12 litres). Saucepans and saucepots are measured by volume (usually 1-8 l). While saucepots often resemble Dutch ovens in shape, {{they do not have the}} same heat capacity characteristics. Very <b>small</b> <b>saucepans</b> used for heating milk are referred to as , such saucepans usually have a lip for pouring the heated milk.|$|R

Methylated spirit, a <b>small</b> {{aluminium}} <b>saucepan,</b> a spirit-lamp, two spoons, two forks, a knife, two aluminium plates, salt, sugar, tea--what else? The thermos flask, the various sandwiches, four apples, and a little tin of butter. So much for the kitchenino, for myself and the queen bee. Then my knapsack and the q-b's handbag.|$|R
50|$|Upon their arrival, both {{material}} {{and social conditions}} were difficult for the sisters. The sisters, who were active in education, faced much opposition from the Protestant teachers. In addition, they faced stark poverty. Upon the sisters' arrival at the mission house where the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart were living and where the sisters were to live, they found a kitchen equipped only with two <b>small</b> <b>saucepans,</b> a few plates, and a single spoon, to serve 12 missionaries. There were no cups or glasses, so the missionaries drank out of jam tins. They lived off of coconuts, taros, fish, black coffee, brown sugar, biscuits, boiled rice, tinned beans, and salted meat. Condensed milk and bread were treats saved for Sundays and feast days. The extreme heat, in addition to malnourishment and disease, caused a number of deaths during the early years; however, it took four months or longer for the news of this to reach Europe.|$|R

"No, father, it was me," [...] {{answered}} Hetty, who {{was engaged}} in stirring something in a <b>small</b> <b>saucepan,</b> the loose handle of which was attached to its battered body by only one rivet; the other rivet had given way on an occasion when Ned Frog sent it flying through the doorway after his retreating wife.

60|$|At last, her eye {{rested on}} an article which stood upon the table, {{and she started}} up impetuously from her chair. She did this so suddenly, that the doctor's hand fell beside him before {{he knew that she}} had risen. The table was covered with all those {{implements}} which become so frequent about a house when severe illness is an inhabitant there. There were little boxes and apothecaries' bottles, cups and saucers standing separate, and bowls, in which messes have been prepared with the hope of suiting a sick man's failing appetite. There was a <b>small</b> <b>saucepan</b> standing on a plate, a curiously shaped glass utensil left by the doctor, and sundry pieces of flannel, which had been used in rubbing the sufferer's limbs. But {{in the middle of the}} débris stood one black bottle, with head erect, unsuited to the companionship in which it was found.|$|E

5000|$|During the Great Patriotic War the Soviet army mess kit was a two-piece design {{similar to}} that used by the Wehrmacht forces that {{consisted}} of a large main canteen part, and a <b>smaller</b> <b>saucepan</b> component that also doubled as the mess tin lid. The kit also had a wire handle which many soldiers used to hang the mess kit from their web equipment or backpack. This design was supplemented in the mid-1980s with a second design that featured a metal water bottle held in the middle. The next layer of the set was a large canteen / cooking pot with a wire handle, then a smaller saucepan-type component with a folding metal handle. This last component fitted over the base of the larger cooking pot, the handle was then folded up and clipped over the cooking pot and the lip of the water bottle. The mess set was sometimes issued with a pouch, although this was by no means certain and many soldiers simply hung it onto their equipment from the wire handle. Officers were often issued a satchel-type bag for their mess kits in keeping with their smart image. This latest design of mess kit continues to be used today in the army of the Russian Federation and doubtless [...] is still used in the armies of former Soviet republics.|$|R
5000|$|In 14th- and 15th-century cookery manuals, a possibly-related word spelled {{variously}} [...] "possenet", [...] "postnet", or [...] "posnet" [...] {{is used to}} mean a <b>small</b> pot or <b>saucepan.</b> In 16th-century and later sources, possets are generally made from lemon or other citrus juice, cream and sugar. Eggs are often added. Some recipes used breadcrumbs to thicken the beverage.|$|R

60|$|By {{protruding}} {{his head}} a little he commanded, through the foliage of a festooning creeper, {{a view of the}} three bungalows. Irregularly disposed along a flat curve, over the veranda rail of the farthermost one hung a dark rug of a tartan pattern, amazingly conspicuous. Ricardo could see the very checks. A brisk fire of sticks was burning on {{the ground in front of}} the steps, and in the sunlight the thin, fluttering flame had paled almost to invisibility--a mere rosy stir under a faint wreath of smoke. He could see the white bandage on the head of Pedro bending over it, and the wisps of black hair standing up weirdly. He had wound that bandage himself, after breaking that shaggy and enormous head. The creature balanced it like a load, staggering towards the steps. Ricardo could see a <b>small,</b> long-handled <b>saucepan</b> at the end of a great hairy paw.|$|R
5000|$|José López-Rey {{suggests}} that this picture {{could be related to}} a lost Velázquez painting described by Antonio Palomino..."where a board is seen, that serves as a table, with a charcoal burner, and a pot boiling on top, and covered with a bowl, and the fire is visible, the flames, and the sparks are clearly visible, a <b>small</b> tin <b>saucepan,</b> an alcarraza, some plates, and some basins, a glazed jug, a mortar with its pestle and a head of garlic next to it; and on the wall there is small basket and a cloth hanging from a hook, and other trinkets; and guarding this is a boy holding a jug, wearing a coif, who with his humble clothes represents a subject that is very ridiculous and amusing". The Dublin version was bequeathed by Alfred Beit in 1987. A 1933 cleaning revealed a depiction of Jesus’ supper at Emmaus on the wall behind the main figure.|$|R
60|$|Mr Abel {{remained}} behind, {{very often}} {{looking at his}} watch and at the room door, until Mr Swiveller was roused from a short nap, by the setting-down on the landing-place outside, as from the shoulders of a porter, of some giant load, which seemed to shake the house, and made the little physic bottles on the mantel-shelf ring again. Directly this sound reached his ears, Mr Abel started up, and hobbled to the door, and opened it; and behold! there stood a strong man, with a mighty hamper, which, being hauled into the room and presently unpacked, disgorged such treasures as tea, and coffee, and wine, and rusks, and oranges, and grapes, and fowls ready trussed for boiling, and calves'-foot jelly, and arrow-root, and sago, and other delicate restoratives, that the small servant, who had never thought it possible that such things could be, except in shops, stood rooted to the spot in her one shoe, with her mouth and eyes watering in unison, and her power of speech quite gone. But, not so Mr Abel; or the strong man who emptied the hamper, big as it was, in a twinkling; and not so the nice old lady, who appeared so suddenly that she might have come out of the hamper too (it was quite large enough), and who, bustling about on tiptoe and without noise--now here, now there, now everywhere at once--began to fill out the jelly in tea-cups, and to make chicken broth in <b>small</b> <b>saucepans,</b> and to peel oranges for the sick man and to cut them up in little pieces, and to ply the small servant with glasses of wine and choice bits of everything until more substantial meat could be prepared for her refreshment. The whole of which appearances were so unexpected and bewildering, that Mr Swiveller, when he had taken two oranges and a little jelly, and had seen the strong man walk off with the empty basket, plainly leaving all that abundance for his use and benefit, was fain to lie down and fall asleep again, from sheer inability to entertain such wonders in his mind.|$|R
6000|$|Saturday, July 15th.--Went with B------ {{yesterday}} to visit several Irish shanties, endeavoring {{to find out}} who had stolen some rails of a fence. At the first door at which we knocked (a shanty with an earthen mound heaped against the wall, two or three feet thick), the inmates were not up, though it was past eight o'clock. At last a middle-aged woman showed herself, half dressed, and completing her toilet. Threats were made of tearing down her house; for she is a lady of very indifferent morals, and sells rum. Few of these people are connected with the mill-dam,--or, at least, many are not so, but have intruded themselves into the vacant huts which were occupied by the mill-dam people last year. In two or three places hereabouts there is quite a village of these dwellings, with a clay and board chimney, or oftener an old barrel, smoked and charred with the fire. Some of their roofs are covered with sods, and appear almost subterranean. One of the little hamlets stands on both sides of a deep dell, wooded and bush-grown, with a vista, as it were, into the heart of a wood in one direction, and to the broad, sunny river in the other: there was a little rivulet, crossed by a plank, {{at the bottom of the}} dell. At two doors we saw very pretty and modest-looking young women,-- one with a child in her arms. Indeed, they all have innumerable little children; and they are invariably in good health, though always dirty of face. They come to the door while their mothers are talking with the visitors, standing straight up on their bare legs, with their little plump bodies protruding, in one hand a <b>small</b> tin <b>saucepan,</b> and in the other an iron spoon, with unwashed mouths, looking as independent as any child or grown person in the land. They stare unabashed, but make no answer when spoken to. [...] "I've no call to your fence, Misser B------." [...] It seems strange that a man should have the right, unarmed with any legal instrument, of tearing down the dwelling-houses of a score of families, and driving the inmates forth without a shelter. Yet B------ undoubtedly has this right; and it is not a little striking to see how quietly these people contemplate the probability of his exercising it,--resolving, indeed, to burrow in their holes as long as may be, yet caring about as little for an ejectment as those who could find a tenement anywhere, and less. Yet the women, amid all the trials of their situation, appear to have kept up the distinction between virtue and vice; those who can claim the former will not associate with the latter. When the women travel with young children, they carry the baby slung at their backs, and sleeping quietly. The dresses of the new-comers are old-fashioned, making them look aged before their time.|$|R
