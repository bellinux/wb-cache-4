40|$|<b>Silico-manganese</b> (SiMn) slag {{has been}} used to develop alkali {{activated}} cement binder. The reactivity of SiMn slag was altered by mechanical activation using eccentric vibratory and attrition mill. The reaction kinetics during alkali activation of SiMn slag and structural reorganization were studied using isothermal conduction calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The particle size after milling was smaller in attrition milled samples but reaction started earlier in vibratory milled samples due to more reactivity. This observation was further supported by compressive strength which was highest in samples prepared from vibratory milled slag. The main reaction product was C-S-H (C= CaO, S = SiO 2, H = H 2 O) of low crystallinity of different types with varying Si/Al and Ca/Si ratio. An attempt has been made to relate the microstructure with mechanical properties.

40|$|Crack {{initiation}} {{and growth}} behaviour in plain hour-glass shaped fatigue specimens of {{quenched and tempered}} <b>silico-manganese</b> spring steel (BS 250 A 53) having a mirror image was studied under fully reversed torsional loading conditions in both the laboratory air and the aggressive (0. 6 M, aerated NaCl solution) environments. A surface plastic replication technique was used alongwith optical microscopy to monitor {{the early stages of}} environment-assisted fatigue. Non-metallic inclusions were observed {{to play a major role}} in crack initiation in both the environments. Debonding at matrix/inclusion interfaces and chemical pitting at inclusion sites were major processes in the early developmental stages of air and corrosion fatigue, respectively. A significant influence of microstructure, i. e. prior austenite grain boundaries, on defect development was also noted during air and corrosion fatigue cracking. Corrosion fatigue failure appears to be a multiple stage process namely; pit development, short crack growth, and long crack growth. Corrosion fatigue crack growth rates are predicted by employing models, which incorporate elastic plastic fracture mechanics parameters to characterise the influence of microstructure. Two empirical corrosion fatigue crack growth models, including a superposition model discussing the inert air and environmental terms involved in the corrosion fatigue process, are presented. A reasonable agreement was found between experimental and calculated lifetimes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{thermal state}} in {{submerged-arc}} furnaces (S. A. F.) producing ferro alloys {{is important for}} the conditions of both the grade of alloy produced as well as specific energy consumption. The temperature profile in the S. A. F. is affected by the endothermic chemical reactions and the rate of gas evolution. The gas evolution com-mences at about 900 C due to the reduction of iron in the ore. A first-principle-based 2 -D model has been developed to predict the temperature profile in the furnace. In this study, four ores of different grades have been considered in order to simulate the thermal profile in the S. A. F. The influence of the composition of the ore on the thermal profile and its significance in rationalisation of charge distribution to optimise the process are discussed. 1. PRODUCTION OF FERRO-CHROME IN S. A. F. The submerged-arc furnace has been the work horse for the production of ferro alloys, for many decades. It is a fairly energy-efficient furnace and is employed for tonnage-production of ferro manganese, ferro silicon, <b>silico-manganese,</b> ferro chromium etc. Three phase power supply is introduced in the process through three electrodes in a cylindrical refractory-lined steel shell.

40|$|The present work {{consists}} of both experimental and theoretical aspects of corrosion fatigue {{in a high}} strength steel. Fatigue tests were conducted under fully reversed shear loading in an aerated 0. 6 M NaC 1 solution at pH 6, for a <b>silico-manganese</b> spring steel (BS 251 A 58) having a yield strength around 1400 MPa. The fatigue crack evolution process can be defined sequentially {{in terms of a}} pit, a short crack in stage I and a crack in stage II. It was observed that in the early stages pits developed at Mn-rich sulphide inclusions, from which short cracks developed and propagated in stage I; the crack growth rate of such cracks was dominated by microstructural features. Stage II, microstructure-independent crack growth was observed following a transition from stage I crack growth. In addition consideration was given to the influences of cyclic frequency, the effect of cathodic polarisation and the effect of electrolyte compositions on corrosion fatigue lifetime and crack growth behaviour. Mechanical properties, metallurgical and electro-chemical properties of the material used were also investigated. The failed specimens were examined using SEM and X-ray spectra analysis in order to study the failure mechanism. Using a dislocation based Navarro-de los Rios model to represent the crack and its associated plastic zone, the crack growth process is characterised by the interaction of dislocations associated with micro-cracks, or local damage, and microstructural barriers (grain boundaries, precipitates, dispersed particles, phase interfaces, etc.). Some modifications to the model were made to incorporate the corrosive effect on the early stages of crack initiation (i. e. pit growth), the transition of stage I crack growth to stage II crack growth, and strain hardening of a parabolic form in order to achieve a more accurate prediction. The validity of the model was justified by the good agreement achieved between predictions based on the model and the experimental results. Based on the present study the following conclusions were made: 1. The fatigue strength of BS 251 A 58 steel, subjected to 107 cycles in a 0. 6 M NaC 1 solution, at pH 6 and at a frequency of 5 Hz, is 98 MPa, and is significantly lower than the value of the fatigue limit in air, i. e. 457. 5 MPa. 2. Corrosion fatigue crack propagation in the high strength BS 251 A 58 steel can be described sequentially in terms of corrosion-induced pits, microcracks from pits, cracks in stage I (shear type cracks), and cracks in stage II (tensile cracks). 3. The number of cycles in the stage I-to-stage II transition, in relation to the whole fatigue life, varies from 20...|$|E
