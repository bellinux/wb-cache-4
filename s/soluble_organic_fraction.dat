50|$|Diesel exhaust {{contains}} {{relatively high}} levels of particulate matter (soot), consisting largely of elemental carbon. Catalytic converters cannot clean up elemental carbon, though they do remove up to 90 percent of the <b>soluble</b> <b>organic</b> <b>fraction,</b> so particulates are cleaned up by a soot trap or diesel particulate filter (DPF). Historically, a DPF consists of a cordierite or silicon carbide substrate with a geometry that forces the exhaust flow through the substrate walls, leaving behind trapped soot particles. Contemporary DPFs can be manufactured {{from a variety of}} rare metals that provide superior performance (at a greater expense). As the amount of soot trapped on the DPF increases, so does the back pressure in the exhaust system. Periodic regenerations (high temperature excursions) are required to initiate combustion of the trapped soot and thereby reducing the exhaust back pressure. The amount of soot loaded on the DPF prior to regeneration may also be limited to prevent extreme exotherms from damaging the trap during regeneration. In the U.S., all on-road light, medium and heavy-duty vehicles powered by diesel and built after January 1, 2007, must meet diesel particulate emission limits, meaning that they effectively have to be equipped with a 2-way catalytic converter and a diesel particulate filter. Note that this applies only to the diesel engine used in the vehicle. As long as the engine was manufactured before January 1, 2007, the vehicle is not required to have the DPF system. This led to an inventory runup by engine manufacturers in late 2006 so they could continue selling pre-DPF vehicles well into 2007. During the re-generation cycle, most systems require the engine to consume more fuel in a relatively short amount of time in order to generate the high temperatures necessary for the cycle to complete. This adversely affects the overall fuel economy of vehicles equipped with DPF systems, especially in vehicles that are driven mostly in city conditions where frequent acceleration requires a larger amount of fuel to be burned and therefore more soot to collect in the exhaust system.|$|E

40|$|Studies {{conducted}} {{over the last}} decade have well established a direct relationship between deteriorating human health and diesel engine exhaust. Biodiesel has shown a lot of promise in terms of both its relatively higher combustion efficiency and lower harmful emissions. Biodiesel has the potential to replace a significant amount of the petroleum used to power diesel engines. The emissions from biodiesel are different than petroleum-based diesel and {{it is important to understand}} how they are different with respect to the levels emitted and the combustibility of the particulates. One of the major pollutants emitted from engine exhaust is particulate matter (PM). PM emitted from tailpipes contains a variety of toxic contaminants either embedded or adsorbed on its surface. This study provides a one to one comparison between PM emitted from a mid-size engine running on petroleum-based diesel versus biodiesel. The key physical and chemical parameters analyzed include metals, benzene <b>soluble</b> <b>organic</b> <b>fraction,</b> elemental and organic carbon fractions, particle morphology, particle number and size distribution. This is the first study of its kind where various aspects of the PM emitted from a biodiesel-operated engine have been extensively studied. The major results from the study showed that metals that come from engine wear are not present in biodiesel exhaust particulate due to its self lubricating properties. Samples collected of mineral diesel exhaust are relatively darker in color and stickier than biodiesel exhaust. Biodiesel and its blends gave more benzene <b>soluble</b> <b>organic</b> <b>fraction</b> (BSOF) in engine exhaust particulate matter than mineral diesel at all operating conditions. B 100 gave higher number of smaller particles in its exhaust than mineral diesel; comprehensively all size particles were also higher in case of B 100.

As load increases, B 20 emission performance in terms of particle concentrations improves very rapidly and even surpasses mineral diesel emission performance. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images for B 100 and B 20 showed granular structure particulates with bigger grain size compared to mineral diesel.

The water sample was passed through Amicon ® YC- 05, YM- 1, YM- 3, YM- 10, YM- 30, YM- 100 and ZM- 500 series membranes after a pre-treatment. The molecular weight distribution and the specific ultra-violet absorbance (SUVA 254) of each fraction obtained from membrane were analyzed, and these fractions were further disinfected with chlorine and chlorine dioxide. The results showed that reverse osmosis (RO) fraction contained mainly dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the water sample, suggesting that the water has been highly contaminated by anthropogenic activities. Meanwhile, the THMs concentration and SUVA 254 increased gradually as the molecular weight of the obtained fractions reduced, indicating that the low molecular weight DOM was the major THMs precursor in the disinfection process with chlorine and chlorine dioxide. The results suggest that THMs in source water of Pearl River could be effectively reduced when pollution of human activity is greatly controlled.

An ignition quality tester (IQT) was used to study the ignition propensity of MTBE blended diesel fuels in a reactive spray environment. The IQT data showed that ignition delay increases linearly as the MTBE fraction increases in the fuel. A four-stroke single cylinder diesel engine was used to generate soot samples for a soot oxidation study. Soot samples were pre-treated using a tube furnace in a nitrogen environment to remove any <b>soluble</b> <b>organic</b> <b>fractions</b> and moisture content. Non-isothermal oxidation of soot samples was conducted using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). It was observed that oxidation of 'MTBE soot' started began at a lower temperature and had higher reaction rate than 'diesel soot' {{across a range of}} temperatures. Several kinetic analyses including an isoconversional method and a combined model fitting method were carried out to evaluate kinetic parameters. The results showed that Diesel and MTBE soot samples had similar activation energy but the pre-exponential factor of MTBE soot was much higher than that of the Diesel soot. This may explain why MTBE soot was more reactive than Diesel soot. It is suggested that adding MTBE to diesel fuel is better for DPF regeneration since an MTBE blend can significantly influence the ignition characteristics and, consequently, the oxidative reactivity of soot.

In order to better understand the importance of OM on the chemistry of this formation, we have developed a protocol allowing previous termextraction/next termfractionation of organic compounds in the rocks. The protocol is based on classical methods currently used for the isolation of humic substances from soils and for the separation of kerogen in ancient sediments using previous termsequential extractionnext term with solvents and water at different pH value. This allows us to the remove a large part of the minerals and to suspend almost all (> 90 %) of the OM (associated with residual recalcitrant minerals) in water.

The Cu(II) binding mechanisms in the WSOF samples were studied by electron spin resonance (ESE.) spectroscopy and potentiometric titrations. Conditional ratios of complexed metal (Mc) to free metal ions (M) at 296 K were calculated. The SS contained higher organic H, N, and P contents, a higher H/C, and a lower C/N ratio than W. Total acidity, carboxyl, and phenolic hydroxyl group contents were generally highest in SS, intermediate in WS₆ and WS₁, and lowest in W. Overall aromatic character and aromatic carboxyl group contents were highest in W, and lowest in SS while the aliphatic proton and carboxyl group contents were highest in SS, and lowest in W. Protein decomposition products were most prevalent in SS, and decreased in concentration as the sludge component in the mixture decreased. At 77 K, the Cu(II) -W complex showed an anisotropic ESR spectrum while the Cu(II) -SS complex showed an isotropic spectrum. These spectral {{results suggest that the}} oxygen donor ligands of W may form relatively strong bonds with Cu(II) due to extensive equatorial chelation while ligands of SS may form little or no chelate bonds with Cu(II).

A maximum Cu(II) binding capacity for W and W₆ was attained near the value of 0. 1 mol Cu(II) /kg WSOF while it was not reached for WS₁ or SS.

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIComparative {{analyzes}} of biomineralization {{models have}} being {{crucial for the}} understanding of the functional properties of biominerals and the elucidation of the processes through which biomacromolecules control the synthesis and structural organization of inorganic mineral-based biomaterials. Among calcium carbonate-containing bioceramics, egg, mollusk and echinoderm shells, and crustacean carapaces, have being fairly well characterized. However, Thoraceca barnacles, although being crustacea, showing molting cycle, build a quite stable and heavily mineralized shell that completely surround the animal, which is for life firmly cemented to the substratum. This makes barnacles an interesting model for studying processes of biomineralization. Here we studied the main microstructural and ultrastructural features of Austromegabalanus psittacus barnacle shell, characterize the occurrence of specific proteoglycans (keratan-, dermatan- and chondroitin- 6 -sulfate proteoglycans) in different <b>soluble</b> and insoluble <b>organic</b> <b>fractions</b> extracted from the shell, and tested them for their ability to crystallize calcium carbonate in vitro. Our results indicate that, in the barnacle model, proteoglycans are good candidates for the modification of the calcite crystal morphology, although the cooperative effect of some additional proteins in the shell could not be excluded.

40|$|The Molecular Analyzer for Complex Refractory Organic-rich Surfaces, MACROS, {{is a novel}} {{instrument}} package being developed at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. MACROS enables the in situ characterization of a sample's composition by coupling two powerful techniques into one compact {{instrument package}}: (1) laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LDMS) for broad detection of inorganic mineral composition and non-volatile organics, and (2) liquid-phase extraction methods to gently isolate the <b>soluble</b> <b>organic</b> and inorganic <b>fraction</b> of a planetary powder for enrichment and detailed analysis by liquid chromatographic separation coupled to LDMS. The LDMS is capable {{of positive and negative}} ion detection, precision mass selection, and fragment analysis. Two modes are included for LDMS: single laser LDMS as the broad survey mode and two step laser mass spectrometry (L 2 MS). The liquid-phase extraction will be done in a newly designed extraction module (EM) prototype, providing selectivity in the analysis of a complex sample. For the sample collection, a diamond drill front end will be used to collect rock/icy powder. With all these components and capabilities together, MACROS offers a versatile analytical instrument for a mission targeting an icy moon, carbonaceous asteroid, or comet, to fully characterize the surface composition and advance our understanding of the chemical inventory present on that body...|$|R
40|$|The European {{diesel engine}} {{industry}} represents a vital sector across the Continent, {{with more than}} 2 million direct work positions and a turnover of over 400 billion Euro. Diesel engines provide large paybacks to society since they are extensively used to transport goods, services and people. In recent years increasing {{attention has been paid}} to the emissions from diesel engines which, like gasoline engine emissions, include carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Diesel engines also produce significant levels of particulate matter (PM), which consists mostly of carbonaceous soot and a <b>soluble</b> <b>organic</b> <b>fraction</b> (SOF) of hydrocarbons that have condensed on the soot. Meeting the emission levels imposed for NOx and PM by legislation (Euro IV in 2005 and, in the 2008 perspective, Euro V) requires the development of a number of critical technologies to fulfill these very stringent emission limits (e. g. 0. 005 g/km for PM). This review is focused on these innovative technologies with special reference to catalytic traps for diesel particulate remova...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{of the performance of}} Brassica carinata oil-derived biodiesel with a commercial rapeseed oil-derived biodiesel and petroleum diesel fuel is discussed as regards engine performance and regulated and unregulated exhaust emissions. B. carinata is an oil crop that can be cultivated in coastal areas of central-southern Italy, where it is more difficult to achieve the productivity potentials of Brassica napus (by far the most common rapeseed cultivated in continental Europe). Experimental tests were carried out on a turbocharged direct injection passenger car diesel engine fueled with 100 % biodiesel. The unregulated exhaust emissions were characterized by determining the SOOT and <b>soluble</b> <b>organic</b> <b>fraction</b> content in the particulate matter, together with analysis of the content and speciation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, some of which are potentially carcinogenic, and of carbonyl compounds (aldehydes, ketones) that act as ozone precursors. B. carinata and commercial biodiesel behaved similarly as far as engine performance and regulated and unregulated emissions were concerned. When compared with petroleum diesel fuel, the engine test bench analysis did not show any appreciable variation of output engine torque values, while {{there was a significant difference}} in specific fuel consumption data at the lowest loads for the biofuels and petroleum diesel fuel. The biofuels were observed to produce higher levels of NOx concentrations and lower levels of PM with respect to the diesel fuel. The engine heat release analysis conducted shows that there is a potential for increased thermal NOx generation when firing biodiesel with no prior modification to the injection timing. It seems that, for both the biofuels, this behavior is caused by an advanced combustion evolution, which is particularly apparent at the higher loads. When compared with petroleum diesel fuel, biodiesel emissions contain less SOOT, and a greater fraction of the particulate was soluble. The analysis and speciation of the <b>soluble</b> <b>organic</b> <b>fraction</b> of biodiesel particulate suggest that the carcinogenic potential of the biodiesel emissions is probably lower than that of petroleum diesel. Its better adaptivity and productivity in clay and sandy-type soils and in semiarid temperate climate and the fact that the performance of its derived biodiesel is quite similar to commercial biodiesel make B. carinata a promising oil crop that could offer the possibility of exploiting the Mediterranean marginal areas for energetic purposes...|$|E
40|$|Experiments are {{conducted}} on a 4 -cylinder direct-injection diesel engine using ultralow-sulfur diesel {{as the base}} fuel and diglyme as the oxygenate component to investigate the particulate emissions of the engine under five engine loads at two engine speeds of 1800  rev min - 1 and 2400  rev min - 1. Blended fuels containing 5 %, 10. 1 %, 15. 2 %, 20. 4 %, 25. 7 % and 53 % by volume of diglyme, corresponding to 2 %, 4 %, 6 %, 8 %, 10 % and 20 % by mass of oxygen, are studied. The study shows that {{with the increase of}} oxygen in the fuel blends, smoke opacity, particulate mass concentration, NO x concentration and brake specific particulate emission are reduced at the two engine speeds. However, the proportion of <b>soluble</b> <b>organic</b> <b>fraction</b> is increased. For each blended fuel, the total particle number concentration is higher while the geometric mean diameter is smaller, compared with that of ultralow-sulfur diesel, though the particle number decreases with the oxygen content of the blended fuel. Furthermore, the blended fuels also increase the number concentrations of particles smaller than 100  nm. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|In {{the region}} of the Serra do Espinhaço Meridional, peat bog is formed in {{hydromorphic}} environments developed in sunken areas on the plain surfaces with vegetation adapted to hydromorphic conditions, favoring the accumulation and preservation of organic matter. This pedoenvironment is developed on the regionally predominant quartzite rocks. Peat bog in the Environmental Protection Area - APA Pau-de-Fruta, located in the watershed of Córrego das Pedras, Diamantina,Brazil, was mapped and three representative profiles were morphologically characterized and sampled for physical, chemical and microbiological analyses. The organic matter was fractionated into fulvic acid (FA), humic acids (HA) and humin (H). Two profiles were sampled to determine the radiocarbon age and &# 948; 13 C. The structural organization of the three profiles is homogeneous. The first two layers consist of fibric, the two subsequent of hemic and the four deepest of sapric peat, showing that organic matter decomposition advances with depth and that the influence of mineral materials in deeper layers is greater. Physical properties were homogeneous in the profiles, but varied in the sampled layers. Chemical properties were similar in the layers, but the Ca content, sum of bases and base saturation differed between profiles. Contents of H predominated in the more <b>soluble</b> <b>organic</b> matter <b>fractions</b> and were accumulated at a higher rate in the surface and deeper layers, while HA levels were higher in the intermediate and FA in the deeper layers. Microbial activity did not vary among profiles and was highest in the surface layers, decreasing with depth. From the results of radiocarbon dating and isotope analysis, it was inferred that bog formation began about 20 thousand years ago and that the vegetation of the area had not changed significantly since then...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the solid and {{dissolved}} <b>organic</b> matter <b>fractions,</b> mineral composition and ionic strength of the soil solution on the sorption behaviour of pesticides were studied. A number of soils, chosen so as to have different clay mineral and organic carbon content, were used to study the sorption of the pesticides atrazine (6 -chloro-N- 2 -ethyl-N- 4 -isopropyl- 1, 3, 5 -triazine- 2, 4 -diamine), 2, 4 -D ((2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) acetic acid), isoproturon (3 -(4 -isopropylphenyl) 1, 1 -dimethylurea) and paraquat (1, 12 ̆ 7 -dimethyl- 4, 42 ̆ 7 -bipyridinium) {{in the presence of}} low and high levels of dissolved organic carbon and different background electrolytes. The sorption behaviour of atrazine, isoproturon and paraquat was dominated by the solid state soil components and the presence of dissolved organic matter had little effect. The sorption of 2, 4 -D was slightly affected by the <b>soluble</b> <b>organic</b> matter in the soil. However, this effect may be due to competition for adsorption sites between the pesticide and the <b>soluble</b> <b>organic</b> matter rather than due to a positive interaction between the pesticide and the <b>soluble</b> <b>fraction</b> of soil <b>organic</b> matter. It is concluded that the major factor governing the sorption of these pesticides is the solid state <b>organic</b> <b>fraction</b> with the clay mineral content also making a significant contribution. The dissolved <b>organic</b> carbon <b>fraction</b> of the total organic carbon in the soil and the ionic strength of the soil solution appear to have little or no effect on the sorption/transport characteristics of these pesticides over the range of concentrations studied.

40|$|Efficiency of {{anaerobic}} digestion (AD) for stabilization of 5 day sludge retention time (SRT) thickened {{waste activated sludge}} (TWAS) is limited by hydrolysis of the floc matrix and cell walls of bacteria in the sludge. Heating is an effective pretreatment to enhance the accessibility to intra and/or extra cellular TWAS organics. Microwave (MW) pretreatment was suggested as an alternative method to conventional heating {{as a result of}} its lower energy requirements and additional athermal effect from MW irradiation. This study evaluates the effect of high temperature (> 100 °C) MW irradiation on sludge solubilization and concomitant performance on subsequent mesophilic AD (MAD). Effects of pretreatment conditions (temperature, MW intensity and TWAS concentration) on changes of sludge characteristics as well as AD biodegradability of whole TWAS (soluble + suspended) and the soluble portion only were evaluated. The highest increase in organic solubilization was observed for 175 °C with 3. 75 °C/min MW intensity. sCOD/tCOD ratios were 4. 5 +/- 0. 8 and 8. 8 +/- 0. 9 fold greater than untreated TWAS for 6. 0 and 11. 8 % TS concentrations, respectively. Biochemical methane potential (BMP) assays demonstrated acute short term methanogenic inhibition for all MW pretreated samples. However, this was accompanied by a longer exponential phase that enhanced the potential biogas production with increased MW pretreatment temperature once the inhibition was overcome. Additional culture acclimation suppressed the inhibition and for TWAS pretreated to 175 °C at 0. 83 °C/min MW intensity, 31 +/- 6 % more biogas vs. the control was produced by the 18 th day of the BMP assay. For digestion of soluble portion, pretreatment at 150 °C at low MW intensity produced the greatest potential increase in biodegradability resulting in 90 % more biogas than that of the control at day 20 of the BMP. Semi-continuous MAD of TWAS with single and dual stage digesters following MW pretreatment at 175 °C at two MW intensities were compared to untreated control MAD systems. With MW pretreatment SRT was decreased from 20 to 5 days without significant changes in the effluent COD characteristics. Lower MW intensity resulted in less improvement on COD stabilization and biogas production for the MAD processes. With incorporation of MW pretreatment the single stage digesters performed better than the two stage system in terms of organics stabilization efficiency and biogas production improvement. Dewaterability of digestate improved with MW pretreatment. MAD biodegradability and rates of degradation of <b>soluble</b> <b>organic</b> <b>fractions</b> at different molecular weight (Mw) intervals was assessed. MW intensity was found to influence the soluble Mw profile distributions as well as subsequent MAD performance and pathways assessed by BMP assay. Energy calculations show that MW pretreatment requires approximately 944 MJ/m 3 WAS (6 % TS). Although MW is an energy intense process, it was found that as long as the excess energy can be used efficiently, MW pretreatment could potentially decrease sludge management costs by up to 58 % if treated sludge can be designated Class A which eliminates transportation and landfill tipping costs. At this time, it is recommended that to enhance WAS (5 d SRT) solubilization and biogas production a single stage MAD with MW pretreatment at 175 °C with 3. 75 °C/min MW intensity should be used...|$|R
