25|$|All {{researched}} psychological {{traits are}} influenced by both genes and environment, to varying degrees. These two sources of influence are often confounded in observational research of individuals or families. An example is the transmission of depression from a depressed mother to her offspring. Theory may hold that the offspring, by virtue of having a depressed mother {{in his or her}} (the offspring's) environment, is at risk for developing depression. However, risk for depression is also influenced to some extent by genes. The mother may both carry genes that contribute to her depression but will also have passed those genes on to her offspring thus increasing the offspring's risk for depression. Genes and environment in this <b>simple</b> <b>transmission</b> model are completely confounded. Experimental and quasi-experimental behavioral genetic research uses genetic methodologies to disentangle this confound and understand the nature and origins of individual differences in behavior. Traditionally this research has been conducted using twin studies and adoption studies, two designs where genetic and environmental influences can be partially un-confounded. More recently, the availability of microarray molecular genetic or genome sequencing technologies allows researchers to measure participant DNA variation directly, and test whether individual genetic variants within genes are associated with psychological traits and psychopathology through methods including genome-wide association studies. One goal of such research is similar to that in positional cloning and its success in Huntington's: once a causal gene is discovered biological research can be conducted to understand how that gene influences the phenotype. One major result of genetic association studies is the general finding that psychological traits and psychopathology, as well as complex medical diseases, are highly polygenic, where a large number (on the order of hundreds to thousands) of genetic variants, each of small effect, contribute to individual differences in the behavioral trait or propensity to the disorder. Active research continues to understand the genetic and environmental bases of behavior and their interaction.|$|E

[...] The problem arises in the domain of language acquisition in that children attain infinitely more than they experience. Literally so, we shall see: they attain a productive system, a grammar, on the basis of very little experience. So there is more, much more, to language acquisition than mimicking what we hear in childhood, and there is more to it than the <b>simple</b> <b>transmission</b> of a set of words and sentences from one generation of speakers to the next. There is more to it than a reproduction of experience and, in maturity, our capacity goes well beyond what we have experienced.|$|E

50|$|With the {{reduction}} method, the crankshaft drives a <b>simple</b> <b>transmission,</b> {{which is usually}} a simple gearbox containing a pinion and spur gear. The propeller speed is inversely proportional to the gear ratio (thereby also increasing output torque by approximately the same ratio). Reduction-drive is common on larger aircraft and aircraft with disproportionately large propellers. On such powerplant arrangements, the transmission serves to match the powerplant's and propeller's optimum operating speed. Geared propellers are rarely used on internal combustion engines, but very commonly on electric motors. This is because most inrunner electric motors spin extremely fast, but have very little torque.|$|E

30|$|IP {{is usually}} {{employed}} with the transport level protocols {{transmission control protocol}} (TCP) and user datagram protocol (UDP). TCP provides reliable and ordered packet delivery and is employed by many popular internet applications, such as World Wide Web (WWW), E-Mail, etc. UDP is commonly used in time-sensitive applications, since it allows lower delays, thanks to a <b>simpler</b> <b>transmission</b> model. Nevertheless, UDP provides unreliable communication: neither the reception of packets nor {{the order of the}} received packets are guaranteed. Hence, it is necessary to include additional mechanisms to give reliability to the communication. In this sense, a typical solution is partly represented by the real-time transport protocol (RTP), an application layer protocol developed by the Video Audio Transport Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) (RFC 3550 [6]) that is generally used over UDP. Although the use of RTP over TCP is not excluded, in this work we focus on the widely used UDP/RTP combination.|$|R

5000|$|The {{channel of}} a R stroke can be {{considered}} as a thin isolated wire of length L and diameter d in which negative electric charge has been stored. In terms of electric circuit theory, one can adopt a <b>simple</b> <b>transmission</b> line model with a capacitor, where the charge is stored, a resistance of the channel, and an inductance simulating the electric properties of the channel. At the moment of contact with the perfectly conducting Earth surface, the charge is lowered to the ground. In order to fulfill the boundary conditions {{at the top of the}} wire (zero electric current) and at the ground (zero electric voltage), only standing resonant waves modes can exit. The fundamental mode which transports electric charge to the ground most effectively, has thus a wavelength λ four times the channel length L. In the case of the K stroke, the lower boundary is the same as the upper boundary. Of course, this picture is valid only for wave mode 1 (λ/4 antenna)and perhaps for mode 2 (λ/2 antenna), because these modes do not yet [...] "feel" [...] the contorted configuration of the real lightning channel. The higher order modes contribute to the incoherent noisy signals in the higher frequency range (> 100 kHz).|$|E

The motors were first met with controversy due to the Shovelhead's weight and ground clearance. Because of this steering and weaving became a new issue that arose with motorcycles fitted with the engine. To bring more models into production, the FX Super Glide was released in 1971 with a [...] "chopper" [...] look that was ultimately an FLH with a Sportster front. This brought the motorcycle scene {{at the time to}} a broader audience and improved sales for the company. The FLH was also available with an Electra-glide package, which was used as a police engine for the motorcycles. It allowed the engines to turn over for a longer period while idling, along with having an electric start. Because of the added weight of the larger engine on motorcycles with the Electra-glide package, the bikes were faster and more powerful at the trade off of being much harder to maneuver. Due to the police package being a rarity, it is highly sought after by collectors. Today, the engines are commonly used by classic motorcycle enthusiasts for restoration projects due to the engine's <b>simple</b> <b>transmission,</b> high torque, and smooth powerband.|$|E
40|$|Scattering induced {{ultrasonic}} attenuation {{offers a}} simple way to characterize material inhomogeneities. This method has a wide range of applications from tissue characterization [1, 2] to ultrasonic NDE, such as grain size measurement in polycrystalline materials [3, 4], structural diagnostics in ceramics [5, 6], porosity assessment in cast metals [7, 8] and composites [9], etc. The scattering induced attenuation of a through transmitted coherent ultrasonic wave can be readily related to certain characteristics of the average inhomogeneity via its total scattering cross-section. In many cases however, ultrasonic attenuation measurement is not feasible except from the backscattered signal. For want of better approximation, the scattering induced attenuation is presumed to have the same relation to the average inhomogeneity as if it were measured by the <b>simpler</b> <b>transmission</b> technique.
