40|$|Typical spider {{dragline}} silk {{tends to}} outperform other natural fibres and most <b>man-made</b> <b>filaments.</b> However, even {{small changes in}} spinning conditions can have large effects on the mechanical properties of a silk fibre {{as well as on}} its water uptake. Absorbed water leads to significant shrinkage in an unrestrained dragline fibre and reversibly converts the material into a rubber. This process is known as supercontraction and may be a functional adaptation for the silk's role in the spider's web. Supercontraction is thought to be controlled by specific motifs in the silk proteins and to be induced by the entropy-driven recoiling of molecular chains. In analogy, in man-made fibres thermal shrinkage induces changes in mechanical properties attributable to the entropy-driven disorientation of 'unfrozen' molecular chains (as in polyethylene terephthalate) or the 'broken' intermolecular hydrogen bonds (as in nylons). Here we show for Nephila major-ampullate silk how in a biological fibre the spinning conditions affect the interplay between shrinkage and mechanical characteristics. This interaction reveals design principles linking the exceptional properties of silk to its molecular orientation.

40|$|Abstract—These days, many {{traditional}} end-user applications {{are said to}} “run fast enough ” on existing machines, so the search continues for novel applications that can leverage the new capabilities of our evolving hardware. Foremost of these potential applications {{are those that are}} clustered around information processing capabilities that humans have today but are lacking in computers. The fact that brains can perform these computations serves as an existence proof that these applications are realizable. At the same time, we often discover that the human nervous system, with its 80 billion neurons, on some metrics, is more powerful and energy-efficient than today’s machines. Both of these aspects make this class of applications a desirable target for an architectural benchmark suite, because there is evidence that these applications are both useful and computationally challenging. This paper details CortexSuite, a Synthetic Brain Benchmark Suite, which seeks to capture this workload. We classify and identify benchmarks within CortexSuite by analogy to the human neural processing function. We use the major lobes of the cerebral cortex {{as a model for the}} organization and classification of data processing algorithms.

40|$|<b>Synthetic,</b> <b>man-made</b> {{polymers}} {{are produced}} from petroleum, however this activity may well decrease {{as a function}} of time because of the non-renewability of the oil. This will result in the decreased production of synthetic polymers with consequent problems to our everyday life because of their ubiquity (food, furniture, containers, electronics…). An alternative could be the use of biopolymers such as cellulose, starch, proteins, amylose and chitin which are extracted from renewable sources. Cellulose is the most abundant biopolymer on earth and is principally found in the cell walls of plants. Cellulose presents interesting properties such as a high thermal stability and high strength, however the principal drawback is its insolubility in both organic and aqueous solvents limiting considerably its use in industry. Chemical modification of the hydroxyl groups of cellulose overcomes some of this problem. In fact, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), where the hydroxyl groups have been modified with ethylene oxide, shows good solubility in aqueous solvents (dimethyl sulfoxide, water) due to the interruption of the cellulose H-bonding networks. Although the chemical modification of cellulose has improved considerably the physical properties of cellulose, the derivatives are usually not competitive against synthetic polymers. Due to its solubility and the presence of the three hydroxyl groups, HEC was chosen as a substrate for chemical modification, with the aim of mimicking the properties of synthetic polymers. The synthetic polymer of reference in our work was poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) because of its solubility in organic and aqueous solvents and sorption properties. The introduction of lactam groups onto HEC could produce a material with properties similar to PVP and this was the goal of our work. Three methods for modifying HEC with lactam groups are reported. The first was the functionalization of HEC with 1 -(hydroxymethyl) - 2 -pyrrolidone (HMP) with degrees of functionalization up to 0. 9 on the primary alcohol functionality of HEC. The functionalized HECs showed markedly different properties to unfunctionalized HEC, such as increased the thermal stability and reduced viscosity. The two others methods led to the preparation of well-defined HEC-g-PVPs using a “grafting from” strategy combined with Atom Transfer Radical Polymerisation (ATRP) and “grafting to” combined with Reversible Addition-Fragmentation Chain-Transfer (RAFT) polymerisation. The ATRP of N-vinylpyrrolidone (NVP) from a prior-synthesised macro-initiator, Br-HEC, did not work efficiently; however, RAFT polymerisation of NVP using an alkyne-terminated xanthate as transfer agent produced an 80...|$|R

In 2009, Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan amount to US$ 1. 3 billion {{which make up}} for 7. 8 % of Pakistan’s total exports. For the same year, India’s exports to Afghanistan stand at 471 million dollars which make 0. 3 % of India’s total exports. Looking at the product wise composition of Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan, mineral fuels, oils, distillation products are on the top with share of around 29 %. Salt, sulpher, earth, plaster, lime and cement and cereals have a share of around 11 %. While animal, vegetable fats and oils, cleavage products and articles of iron and steel have the share of around 7 %. On the other hand, the top five exports of India to Afghanistan are <b>man-made</b> <b>filaments</b> with 42 % share, pharmaceutical products with 11 % share, electric and electronic equipment with 7 % share and rubber and articles with 6 % share. Clearly there is no overlap between exports of Pakistan and India to Afghanistan. Nonetheless Pakistan has already lost its market share to India in pharmaceuticals. The tariff applied to Pakistan by Afghanistan on pharmaceuticals is 2. 50 % while India which enjoys Preferential Trade Agreement with Afghanistan only faces an average tariff of 0. 60 % on pharmaceuticals. Pharmaceuticals are Pakistan’s top performing exports to CARs with 42. 5 % share of total exports to CARs. India also exports pharmaceuticals to CARs but its share in total exports to CARs is only 25. 5 %. In Afghanistan, Pakistan has clearly lost its market share to India due to presence of preferential tariffs for India in Afghanistan. If Pakistan provides transit route to India for its exports to Afghanistan, cheaper pharmaceuticals of Indian origin can then be re-exported to CARs capturing Pakistan’s market share in CARs. Much like pharmaceuticals there are other Pakistani products which are likely to lose out to India in Afghanistan and CARs if India is provided transit route to Afghanistan. The Wagah-Peshawar-Torkham route which roughly extends up to 800 km is probably the shortest possible one between India and Afghanistan; which would greatly reduce the logistics cost of shipping goods from India to Afghanistan and beyond. In addition to that, the preferential treatment currently enjoyed by Indian products in Afghanistan under the PTA would further cost Pakistani goods by eroding their competitiveness in the Afghan market. In {{the absence of a}} robust mechanism to contain the informal trade, allowing Indian goods a passage through Pakistan’s territory would, in all likelihood, worsen the smuggling situation, something Pakistan can ill afford to accept. Therefore, under the circumstances, there are clear economic disadvantages to Pakistan in extending the transit facility to India without adequate safeguards and preferably a quid pro quo, be it political or economic. ...|$|R

40|$|Nitrogen (N) is an {{essential}} plant nutrient in maize production, and if considering only natural sources, is often the limiting factor world-wide {{in terms of a}} plant’s grain yield. For this reason, many farmers around the world supplement available soil N with <b>synthetic</b> <b>man-made</b> forms. Years of over-application of N fertilizer have led to increased N in groundwater and streams due to leaching and run-off from agricultural sites. In the Midwest Corn Belt much of this excess N eventually makes its way to the Gulf of Mexico leading to eutrophication (increase of phytoplankton) and a hypoxic (reduced oxygen) dead zone. Growing concerns about these types of problems and desire for greater input use efficiency have led to demand for crops with improved N use efficiency (NUE) to allow reduced N fertilizer application rates and subsequently lower N pollution. It is well known that roots are responsible for N uptake by plants, but it is relatively unknown how root architecture affects this ability. This research was conducted to better understand the influence of root complexity (RC) in maize on a plant’s response to N stress as well as the influence of RC on other above-ground plant traits. Thirty-one above-ground plant traits were measured for 64 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from the intermated B 73 & Mo 17 (IBM) population and their backcrosses (BCs) to either parent, B 73 and Mo 17, under normal (182 kg N ha- 1) and N deficient (0 kg N ha- 1) conditions. The RILs were selected based on results from an earlier experiment by Novais et al. (2011) which screened 232 RILs from the IBM to obtain their root complexity measurements. The 64 selected RILs were comprised of 31 of the lowest complexity RILs (RC 1) and 33 of the highest complexity RILs (RC 2) in terms of root architecture (characterized as fractal dimensions). The use of the parental BCs classifies the experiment as Design III, an experimental design developed by Comstock and Robinson (1952) which allows for estimation of dominance significance and level. Of the 31 traits measured, 12 were whole plant traits chosen due to their documented response to N stress. The other 19 traits were ear traits commonly measured for their influence on yield. Results showed that genotypes from RC 1 and RC 2 significantly differ for several above-ground phenotypes. We also observed a difference in the number and magnitude of N treatment responses between the two RC classes. Differences in phenotypic trait correlations and their change in response to N were also observed between the RC classes. RC did not seem to have a strong correlation with calculated NUE (ΔYield/ΔN). Quantitative genetic analysis utilizing the Design III experimental design revealed significant dominance effects acting on several traits as well as changes in significance and dominance level between N treatments. Several QTL were mapped for 26 of the 31 traits and significant N effects were observed across the majority of the genome for some N stress indicative traits (e. g. stay-green).

40|$|Yeast is {{the main}} driving force behind many food {{fermentation}} processes, including the production of beer, wine, sake and bread. Historically, these processes originate from uncontrolled, spontaneous fermentation reactions that rely on a complex mixture of microbes present in the environment. Because such spontaneous processes are inherently inconsistent, inefficient {{and the presence of}} undesired spoilage microbes regularly leads to the formation of off-flavors, most of todays industrial production utilizes defined starter cultures, often consisting of a specific domesticated strain of S. cerevisiae, S. bayanus, or S. pastorianus. Although this practice greatly improved process consistency, efficiency, and overall quality, the choice for a particular yeast strain for a specific industrial application is often based on historical, rather than scientific grounds, often resulting in the commercial application of a suboptimal strain. Moreover, new biotechnological yeast applications, such as the production of second-generation biofuels and other biochemicals, or the controlled fermentation of cocoa for the production of chocolate, confront yeast with completely new environments and challenges. Therefore, this study aims to identify or develop novel, superior yeast variants for both new and traditional fermentation processes. In the first chapter, we give a detailed, comprehensive literature overview of the natural biodiversity of Saccharomyces yeasts, describe the history of single-strain yeast starter cultures and discuss several methods to developed artificial yeast variants with altered characteristics. In Chapter 2, we describe the large-scale phenotypic investigation (mainly focusing on stress tolerance, aroma production and fermentation characteristics) of a broad collection of genetically diverse Saccharomyces yeasts originating from various niches. This way, we were able to identify some interesting patterns and correlations, and revealed some systematic differences between natural strains (so-called non-domesticated or wild strains) and strains from <b>synthetic</b> (<b>man-made)</b> fermentation environments (domesticated strains). For example, we were able to show that the production of fruity acetate esters is significantly higher in domesticated compared to natural strains, hinting towards positive selection for this trait during domestication. Moreover, the resulting dataset allowed selection of phenotypically interesting yeast strains directly employable in specific industrial settings, such as the selection of highly osmo- and ethanol-tolerant wine and wild strains for the production of second generation bioethanol. In Chapter 3 and 4, we further use this dataset as a platform to select parental strains for further phenotypic improvement through large-scale breeding programs. In these experiments, we mainly target the yeasts ability to produce high concentrations of isoamyl acetate (IA), the main responsible for the fruity flavors in fermented foods and beverages. This way, novel hybrid strains were developed for the production of highly aromatic ale beers (Chapter 3). Interestingly, many of these newly developed beer yeasts showed a strong heterosis effect for IA production, while retaining their overall fermentation performance. Additionally, novel hybrid yeasts for the production of specialty chocolate were produced (Chapter 4). These new variants combine beneficial traits from both parental strains: robustness in a cocoa environment and a high production of fruity aroma compounds. In a final chapter, we used Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping to identify genetic factors underlying the immense differences in IA production observed in S. cerevisiae strains. The genetic mechanisms underlying this complex (but industrially highly relevant) trait are currently insufficiently studied and identification of superior alleles might enable more targeted approaches of strain improvement, such as genetic engineering or marker-assisted breeding. In conclusion, this work provides a global overview of the Saccharomyces phenome (with the main focus on industrially relevant traits) and the exploitation of the resulting dataset for the development of superior yeast variants and the investigation of the genetic factors underlying natural diversity of aroma production. nrpages: 172 status: publishe...|$|R

The first synthetic dye was William Perkin's mauveine in 1856, derived from coal tar. Alizarin, the red dye present in madder, was the first natural pigment to be duplicated synthetically in 1869, a development which led to the collapse of the market for naturally grown madder. The development of new, strongly colored synthetic dyes followed quickly, and by the 1870s commercial dyeing with natural dyestuffs was disappearing.|$|R
40|$|Nature, through {{evolution}} over {{millions of}} years, has perfected materials with amazing characteristics and awe-inspiring functionalities that exceed the performance of <b>man-made</b> <b>synthetic</b> materials. One such remarkable material is native resilin – an extracellular skeletal protein that {{plays a major role}} in the jumping, flying, and sound production mechanisms in many insects. It is one of the most resilient (energy efficient) elastomeric biomaterials known with a resilience of ∼ 97 % and a fatigue life in excess of 300 million cycles. Recently, resilin-like polypeptides (RLPs) with exquisite control over the amino acid sequence (comprising repeat resilin motifs) and tuneable biological properties and/or functions have been generated by genetic engineering and cloning techniques. RLPs have been the subject of intensive investigation over a decade and are now recognized to be multi-functional and multi-stimuli responsive; including temperature (exhibiting both an upper and a lower critical solution temperature), pH, moisture, ion and photo-responsive with tuneable photo-physical properties. Such unusual multi-stimuli responsiveness has scarcely been offered and reported for either synthetic or natural biopolymers. Furthermore, the directed molecular self-assembly property of RLPs also exhibits promise as efficient templates for the synthesis and stabilization of metal nanoparticles. These developments and observations reveal the opportunities and new challenges for RLPs as novel materials for nanotechnology, nanobiotechnology and therapeutic applications. In this review, we discuss and highlight the design and synthesis of different RLPs, their unique molecular architecture, advanced responsive behaviour, and functionality of hydrogels, solid–liquid interfaces, nanoparticles and nanobioconjugates derived from RLPs.

40|$|How will {{humanity}} {{react to}} the discovery of extraterrestrial life? Speculation on this topic abounds, but empirical research is practically non-existent. We report the results of three empirical studies assessing psychological reactions {{to the discovery of}} extraterrestrial life using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) text analysis software. We examined language use in media coverage of past discovery announcements of this nature, with a focus on extraterrestrial microbial life (Pilot Study). A large online sample (N = 501) was asked to write about their own and humanity’s reaction to a hypothetical announcement of such a discovery (Study 1), and an independent, large online sample (N = 256) was asked to read and respond to a newspaper story about the claim that fossilized extraterrestrial microbial life had been found in a meteorite of Martian origin (Study 2). Across these studies, we found that reactions were significantly more positive than negative, and more reward vs. risk oriented. A mini-meta-analysis revealed large overall effect sizes (positive vs. negative affect language: g = 0. 98; reward vs. risk language: g = 0. 81). We also found that people’s forecasts of their own reactions showed a greater positivity bias than their forecasts of humanity’s reactions (Study 1), and that responses to reading an actual announcement of the discovery of extraterrestrial microbial life showed a greater positivity bias than responses to reading an actual announcement of the creation of <b>man-made</b> <b>synthetic</b> life (Study 2). Taken together, this work suggests that our reactions to a future confirmed discovery of microbial extraterrestrial life are likely to be fairly positive...|$|R
