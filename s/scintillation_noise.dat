40|$|<b>Scintillation</b> <b>noise</b> {{due to the}} Earth's {{turbulent}} atmosphere can be {{a dominant}} noise source in high-precision astronomical photometry when observing bright targets from the ground. Here we describe the phenomenon of scintillation from its physical origins to its effect on photometry. We show that Young's (1967) scintillation-noise approximation used by many astronomers tends to underestimate the median <b>scintillation</b> <b>noise</b> at several major observatories around the world. We show that using median atmospheric optical turbulence profiles, which are now available for most sites, provides a better estimate of the expected <b>scintillation</b> <b>noise</b> and that real-time turbulence profiles {{can be used to}} precisely characterise the <b>scintillation</b> <b>noise</b> component of contemporaneous photometric measurements. This will enable a better understanding and calibration of photometric noise sources and the effectiveness of scintillation correction techniques. We also provide new equations for calculating <b>scintillation</b> <b>noise,</b> including for extremely large telescopes where the <b>scintillation</b> <b>noise</b> will actually be lower than previously thought. These equations highlight the fact that <b>scintillation</b> <b>noise</b> and shot noise have the same dependence on exposure time and so if an observation is scintillation limited, it will be scintillation limited for all exposure times. The ratio of <b>scintillation</b> <b>noise</b> to shot noise is also only weakly dependent on telescope diameter and so a bigger telescope may not yield a reduction in fractional <b>scintillation</b> <b>noise.</b> Comment: 11 pages, 12 figures, accepted in MNRA...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{measurements of}} the size of the Vela pulsar via scintillation, using both fits to the distribution of intensity and {{measurements of the}} modulation index. We briefly discuss systematic effects other than source size that can affect the distribution, including gain variations, self-noise, <b>scintillation</b> shot <b>noise,</b> and correlator saturation. Modulation index, a single number, can be biased by all of these, whereas the distribution of intensity is affected in different ways by different effects, providing means of distinguishing among them. Self-noise and gain variations are likely more important at long observing wavelengths, and correlator saturation and <b>scintillation</b> shot <b>noise</b> at short wavelengths. We find a size of about 500 km at decimeter wavelengths. Interestingly, this agrees with measurements of modulation index by Roberts & Ables at the same wavelength. Their results (and more recently that reported by Macquart et al.) suggest that size decreases with increasing wavelength. Although consistent with the observations, this conclusion is perhaps surprising from the standpoint of the traditional radius-to-frequency mapping. However, these measurements are of size rather than height; and of course systematic effects may play a role. Comment: 4 pages, 2 figures, to appear in Proc.

Many low-frequency experiments are underway to detect the power spectrum of brightness temperature fluctuations of the neutral-hydrogen 21 -cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR: 12 ≳ z ≳ 7, 100 ≲ ν ≲ 175 MHz). In this paper, we derive <b>scintillation</b> <b>noise</b> power spectra in such experiments while taking into account the effects of typical data processing operations such as self-calibration and Fourier synthesis. We find that for minimally redundant arrays such as LOFAR and MWA, <b>scintillation</b> <b>noise</b> is of the same order of magnitude as thermal noise, has a spectral coherence dictated by stretching of the snapshot uv-coverage with frequency, and thus is confined to the well-known wedge-like structure in the cylindrical (two-dimensional) power spectrum space.

The simulation also accounts for LSO's non-proportional scintillation response, the bulk attenuation to its own <b>scintillation</b> and the <b>noise</b> contribution from the amplification of photoelectrons in the readout units. The model predicts that the increased photostatistics available in LSO compared to BGO leads to improvements by up to a factor five in the peak-to-valley ratios of the position response of the block to a uniform flood of 511 keV photons.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the potential of}} lunar occultations {{for the detection of}} very faint companions, and in particular for the possibility of detecting extrasolar planets. We review the basic concepts of the method, and discuss the quantities which are relevant for this particular application. The near-infrared range, and in particular the K and L bands (2. 2 and 3. 6 m), offer the best dynamic range. We present results of detailed simulations based on previous experience with lunar occultation events, and taking into account a realistic noise model which includes the effects of detector, lunar background, scintillation. We conclude that lunar occultations at a large telescope (8 - 10 m class) can detect companions 5 to 11 magnitudes fainter than the primary, at distances of order 0 : 01. The detection is highly asymmetric, with <b>scintillation</b> and photon <b>noise</b> from the central star being the limiting factor in one half-plane of the sky.

40|$|On 1998 November 14, Saturn and its rings occulted {{the star}} GSC 0622 - 00345. The {{occultation}} latitude was 55. 5 degrees S. This paper analyzes the 2. 3 μm light curve derived by Harrington & French. A fixed-baseline isothermal {{fit to the}} light curve has a temperature of 140 +/- 3 K, assuming a mean molecular mass of 2. 35 AMU. The thermal profile obtained by numerical inversion is valid between 1 and 60 μbar. The vertical temperature gradient is > 0. 2 K/km more stable than the adiabatic lapse rate, but it still shows the alternating-rounded-spiked features seen in many temperature gradient profiles from other atmospheric occultations and usually attributed to breaking gravity (buoyancy) waves. We conduct a wavelet analysis of the thermal profile, and show that, even with our low level of <b>noise,</b> <b>scintillation</b> due to turbulence in Earth's atmosphere can produce large temperature swings in light-curve inversions. Spurious periodic features in the "reliable" region of a wavelet amplitude spectrum can exceed 0. 3 K in our data. We also show that gravity-wave model fits to noisy isothermal light curves can lead to convincing wave "detections". We provide new significance tests for localized wavelet amplitudes, wave model fits, and global power spectra of inverted occultation light curves by assessing the effects of pre- and post-occultation noise on these parameters. Based on these tests, we detect several significant ridges and isolated peaks in wavelet amplitude, to which we fit a gravity wave model. We also strongly detect the global power spectrum of thermal fluctuations in Saturn's atmosphere, which resembles the "universal" (modified Desaubies) curve associated with saturated spectra of propagating gravity waves on Earth and Jupiter.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a new concept}} to correct for <b>scintillation</b> <b>noise</b> on high-precision photometry in large and extremely large telescopes using telemetry data from adaptive optics (AO) systems. Most wide-field AO systems designed for the current era of very large telescopes and the next generation of extremely large telescopes require several guide stars to probe the turbulent atmosphere in the volume above the telescope. These data can be used to tomographically reconstruct the atmospheric turbulence profile and phase aberrations of the wavefront in order to assist wide-field AO correction. If the wavefront aberrations and altitude of the atmospheric turbulent layers are known from this tomographic model, then the effect of the scintillation can be calculated numerically and used to normalize the photometric light curve. We show through detailed Monte Carlo simulation that for an 8 m telescope with a 16 × 16 AO system we can reduce the <b>scintillation</b> <b>noise</b> by an order of magnitude...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of free-space optical (FSO) communication systems in a turbulent atmosphere employing optical amplifiers (OAs) to extend transmission reach and wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) to improve capacity. This system performance is considered {{in the presence of}} amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) <b>noise,</b> <b>scintillation,</b> beam spreading, atmospheric attenuation and interchannel crosstalk. In this work, the modulation scheme used is the on-off keying non-return-to-zero and the main performance metric employed is the average bit error rate (BER). Various performance evaluation methods are used to estimate system performance. Analysis of single link, cascaded OA and WDM FSO communication systems are given and the implications of using both adaptive (to channel state) and non-adaptive decision threshold schemes are analysed. The benefits of amplifier saturation, for example in the form of effective scintillation reduction when a non-adaptive decision threshold scheme is utilised at the receiver for different atmospheric turbulence regimes, are presented. Monte Carlo simulation techniques are used to model the probability distributions of system parameters such as the optical signal power, amplified spontaneous emission noise, optical signal to noise ratio and the average bit error rate due to scintillation. It is found that {{the performance of}} an adaptive decision threshold is superior to a non-adaptive decision threshold for both saturated and fixed gain preamplified receivers and the ability of a saturated gain OA to suppress scintillation is only meaningful for system performance when a non-adaptive decision threshold is used at the receiver. In a saturated gain preamplified system, the optimum non-adaptive decision threshold is investigated. An OA cascade can be successfully used to extend reach in FSO communication systems and specific system implementations are presented. The optimal cascade scheme with a non-adaptive receiver would use frequent low gain saturated amplification although this has a cost implication. Furthermore, a saturated gain amplified WDM FSO system with a non-adaptive decision threshold is superior to a non-amplified WDM FSO system with an adaptive decision threshold...|$|R
30|$|Range {{alignment}} is {{to compensate}} the range shifts of profiles. Without priorknowledge available about the range shifts, range alignment is usually realized based on the similarity of high-resolution range profiles (HRRPs). Typical methods for range alignment can be sorted into three groups. The first class {{is based on a}} maximum correlation between adjacent profiles [4]. The dominant scatter method tracks a prominent scatter and estimates the range shift. And, the maximum correlation method [4] aligns each HRRP by using the principle that the envelope correlation of two adjacent profiles reaches a maximum when they are aligned. Actually, the principle of maximum correlation of two adjacent profiles can be regarded as a local optimization of alignment. Because the estimation of range shifts between every two adjacent envelopes is independent of each other. As a result, this method is sensitive to target scintillation. And, it is likely to fail when strong noise presents, as the coherence of HRRPs is contaminated seriously. The other group is optimization-based methods [5 – 9]. It is widely accepted that global optimization methods are more robust to reflectivity <b>scintillation</b> and additive <b>noise</b> than maximum correlation method, in which the problem of ISAR range alignment is formulated by using some global metrics. Minimum entropy or maximum contrast of the synthetic profile, such as the average range profile (ARP) of the aligned profiles, is used as the criterion to evaluate the performance of range alignment. The synthetic profile usually has the highest sharpness when the profiles are aligned perfectly. Or else, the sharpness of synthetic envelope reduces. It is reasonable to evaluate the sharpness of the synthetic profile by contrast or entropy and establish an optimization for range alignment. In general, the synthetic profile is calculated as the mean of magnitude of the aligned HRRPs. Therefore, the synthetic profile {{can be viewed as a}} non-coherent energy accumulation of aligned profiles, and it can overcome the noise interference in some degree. However, in the situations of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the SNR gain from the non-coherent integrant is not enough to overcome the interference from noise on the synthetic profile, leading to that the consistency between the sharpness of the synthetic profile and the quality of range alignment is broken. In this sense, it is still challenging to achieve optimal range alignment in presence of strong noise.|$|R

Using differential spectrophotometry, we observed one transit in 2013 {{and another in}} 2014, with average spectral resolutions of ~ 700 and ~ 250, spanning the Johnson BVR photometric bands. We find a white-light planet-to-star radius ratio of 0. 0190 - 0. 0027 + 0. 0023 from the 2013 observations and 0. 0200 - 0. 0018 + 0. 0017 from the 2014 observations.

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of ground-based astronomical photometry {{is limited by}} two factors: photon statistics and stellar scintillation arising when star light passes through Earth's atmosphere. This paper examines the theoretical role of the outer scale L_ 0 of the optical turbulence (OT) which suppresses the low-frequency component of scintillation. It is shown that for typical values of L_ 0 ∼ 25 - 50 m, this effect becomes noticeable for a telescopes of diameter around 4 m. On extremely large, 30 - 40 m, telescopes with exposures longer than a few seconds, {{the inclusion of the}} outer scale in the calculation reduces the scintillation power by more than a factor of 10 relative to conventional estimates.

40|$|The {{turbulent}} atmosphere has two detrimental eﬀects in astronomy. The phase aberration {{induced by}} the turbulence broaden the point spread function (PSF) and limits the resolution for imaging. If there is strong turbulence high in the atmosphere then these phase aberration propagate and develop into intensity fluctuations (scintillation). This thesis describes three novel instruments related to these problems associated with atmospheric turbulence. The ﬁrst is an optical turbulence proﬁler to measure the turbulence strength and its position within the atmospheric surface layer in real-time. The instrument is a development of the slope detection and ranging (SLODAR) method. Results from the prototype at Paranal Observatory are discussed. An instrument to improve the PSF for imaging is also discussed. The instrument works by adaptively blocking the telescope pupil to remove areas which are {{the most out of}} phase from the mean. This acts to ﬂatten the wavefront and can therefore be used after an adaptive optics system as an additional clean up, or stand alone on a telescope as a relatively aﬀordable and easy way to improve the PSF.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in space-qualified atomic clocks (low-mass, low power-consumption, frequency stability {{comparable to that}} of ground-based clocks) can enable interplanetary spacecraft radio science experiments at unprecedented Doppler sensitivities. The addition of an on-board digital receiver would allow the up- and down-link Doppler frequencies to be measured separately. Such separate, high-quality measurements allow optimal data combinations that suppress the currently-leading noise sources: phase <b>scintillation</b> <b>noise</b> from the Earth's atmosphere and Doppler noise caused by mechanical vibrations of the ground antenna. Here we provide a general expression for the optimal combination of ground and on-board Doppler data and compute the sensitivity such a system would have to low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs). Assuming a plasma <b>scintillation</b> <b>noise</b> calibration comparable to that already demonstrated with the multi-link CASSINI radio system, the space-clock/digital-receiver instrumentation enhancements would give GW strain sensitivity of 2. 0 × 10 ^- 17 for randomly polarized, monochromatic GW signals over a two-decade (∼ 0. 0001 - 0. 01 Hz) region of the low-frequency band. This is about an order of magnitude better than currently achieved with traditional two-way coherent Doppler experiments. The utility of optimally combining simultaneous up- and down-link observations is not limited to GW searches. The Doppler tracking technique discussed here could be performed at minimal incremental cost to also improve other radio science experiments (i. e. tests of relativistic gravity, planetary and satellite gravity field measurements, atmospheric and ring occultations) on future interplanetary missions.

40|$|High {{precision}} fast photometry from ground-based observatories is {{a challenge}} due to intensity fluctuations (scintillation) produced by the Earth's atmosphere. Here we describe a method to reduce the effects of scintillation {{by a combination of}} pupil reconjugation and calibration using a comparison star. Because scintillation is produced by high altitude turbulence, the range of angles over which the scintillation is correlated is small and therefore simple correction by a comparison star is normally impossible. We propose reconjugating the telescope pupil to a high dominant layer of turbulence, then apodizing it before calibration with a comparison star. We find by simulation that given a simple atmosphere with a single high altitude turbulent layer and a strong surface layer a reduction in the intensity variance by a factor of 30 is possible. Given a more realistic atmosphere as measured by SCIDAR at San Pedro Mártir we find that on a night with a strong high altitude layer we can expect the median variance to be reduced by a factor of 11. By reducing the <b>scintillation</b> <b>noise</b> {{we will be able to}} detect much smaller changes in brightness. If we assume a 2 m telescope and an exposure time of 30 seconds a reduction in the <b>scintillation</b> <b>noise</b> from 0. 78 mmag to 0. 21 mmag is possible, which will enable the routine detection of, for example, the secondary transits of extrasolar planets from the ground.

Measurements of optical signals over a two-mile path under a full variety of weather con-ditions have permitted a comparative evaluation of AM, FM, and PM systems.

Measurements of pulses transmitted appreciably beyond the limits of visibility in snow and fog indicate a channel bandwidth, limited by scatter-multipaths, but of the order of 200 Mcps...|$|E
40|$|The stellar {{scintillation}} {{is one of}} the fundamental limitation to the precision of ground-based photometry. The paper examines the problem of correlation of the scintillation of two close stars at the focus of a large telescope. The derived correlation functions were applied to data of the long-term study of the optical turbulence (OT) in the Northern Caucasus with MASS (Multi-Aperture Scintillation Sensor) instrument to predict the angular correlation of the scintillation at the Sternberg institute 2. 5 m telescope currently in construction. A median angular radius of the correlation as large as 20 arcsec was found for the case of Kolmogorov OT. On the basis of the obtained relations we also analyze the correlation impact in ensemble photometry and conjugate plane photometry. It is shown that a reduction of the <b>scintillation</b> <b>noise</b> up to 8 times can be achieved when using a crowded ensemble of comparison stars. The calculation of the angular correlation can be repeated for any large telescope at the site where the OT vertical profiles are known.

40|$|We {{have carried}} out {{photometric}} follow-up observations of bright transiting extrasolar planets using the CbNUOJ 0. 6 m telescope. We have tested {{the possibility of}} obtaining high photometric precision by applying the telescope defocus technique allowing the use of several hundred seconds in exposure time for a single measurement. We demonstrate that this technique is capable of obtaining a root-mean-square scatter of order sub-millimagnitude over several hours for a V ∼ 10 host star typical for transiting planets detected from ground-based survey facilities. We compare our results with transit observations with the telescope operated in in-focus mode. High photometric precision is obtained due to the collection of a larger amount of photons resulting in a higher signal compared to other random and systematic noise sources. Accurate telescope tracking is likely to further contribute to lowering systematic noise by probing the same pixels on the CCD. Furthermore, a longer exposure time helps reducing the effect of <b>scintillation</b> <b>noise</b> which otherwise has a significant effect for small-aperture telescopes operated in in-focus mode. Finally we present the results of modelling four light-curves for which a root-mean-square scatter of 0. 70 to 2. 3 milli-magnitudes have been achieved. Comment: 12 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables.

40|$|Abstract. Antarctica offers unique {{conditions}} for ground-based observations, such as low sky {{background in the}} infrared, improved seeing, and low turbulence and <b>scintillation</b> <b>noise.</b> These properties are particularly beneficial for imaging, precision photometry and infrared observations. It may be less clear if Antarctica offers equally compelling advantages for spectroscopy, in particular in the optical domain. However, scientific programmes that make use of imaging (or 3 D) spectroscopy for selected follow-up studies of IR surveys, long-term monitoring of extended targets and resolved stellar population studies in crowded fields, also benefit from the site conditions at Dome C. 1 Scenarios for Imaging Spectroscopy The major motivations to conduct astronomical observations in Antarctica seem to be (wide-field) infrared surveys, diffraction-limited imaging and long-term accurate photometric monitoring. While for these programmes the conditions in space are superior, a ground-based site in Antarctica offers lower costs and the option to deploy larger telescopes and instruments. As spectroscopy requires larger collecting areas than imaging, {{it needs to be}} evaluated for which cases a median-sized telescope at Antarctica can outperform a larger one at temperate sites. However, if spectroscopy were combined with imaging, as in 3 D- or Integral-Field Spectroscopy (IFS), which provides multiple spectra for each point of a 2 -dimensional field, the case for Antarctica becomes more compelling. For extended targets, such as clusters, HII regions, nebulae, jets, or galactic environments, the use of integral-field techniques becomes necessary to overcome the source confusion in these complex fields. Integral field spectrophotometry is a useful technique for the study of resolved stellar populations in nearby galaxies (Roth et al. 2004). The spectroscopy of individual extragalactic stars is limite...|$|E
40|$|HOPI is a {{special-purpose}} science {{instrument for}} SOFIA {{that is designed}} to provide simultaneous high-speed time resolved imaging photometry at two optical wavelengths. We intend to make it possible to mount HOPI and FLITECAM on the SOFIA telescope simultaneously to allow data acquisition at two optical wavelengths and one near-IR wavelength. HOPI will have a flexible optical system and numerous readout modes, allowing many specialized observations to be made. The instrument characteristics required for our proposed scientific pursuits are closely aligned to those needed for critical tests of the completed SOFIA Observatory, and HOPI will be used heavily for these tests. Our main scientific interest is in the use of HOPI for observing stellar occultations. In a stellar occultation, a star serves as a small probe of the atmospheric structure of a solar system object or the surface density structure of a planetary ring or comet. Such observations provide information at kilometer-scale spatial resolution that would otherwise require a space mission to obtain. This work makes use of SOFIA’s mobility, freedom from clouds, and near-absence of <b>scintillation</b> <b>noise</b> to provide the best possible occultation data. The addition of a coarse grism in a filter position would make it suitable for lunar occultations and other spectrally resolved time series observations. Also, the low atmospheric scintillation for airborne photometry gives HOPI the potential to detect P-mode stellar oscillations in sunlike stars. HOPI will be available for Guest Investigator use on a collaborative basis, and potential Guest Investigators should contact the PI prior to proposing to insure that the proposed observations are feasible and make the best use of HOPI’s capabilities...|$|E
