2500|$|There {{are many}} motivations for <b>self-experiment.</b> These include {{the wish to}} get results quickly and avoid {{the need for a}} formal {{organisational}} structure, to take the ethical stance of taking the same risk as volunteers, or just a desire to do good for humanity.

2500|$|Self-experimentation {{has value}} in rapidly obtaining the first results. [...] In some cases, such as with Forssmann's {{experiments}} done {{in defiance of}} official permission, results may be obtained that would never otherwise have come to light. [...] However, <b>self-experiment</b> lacks the statistical validity of a larger experiment. [...] It {{is not possible to}} generalise from an experiment on a single person. [...] For instance, a single successful blood transfusion does not indicate, as we now know from the work of Karl Landsteiner, that all such transfusions between any two random people will also be successful. [...] Likewise, a single failure does not absolutely prove that a procedure is worthless. [...] Psychological issues such as confirmation bias and the placebo effect are unavoidable in a single-person <b>self-experiment</b> where {{it is not possible to}} put scientific controls in place.|$|E
2500|$|Minovici and Fleichmann are not {{the only}} ones to <b>self-experiment</b> with strangulation. [...] Graeme Hammond, a doctor in New York, tried it in 1882.

2500|$|Daniel Alcides Carrión, in 1885, {{infected}} {{himself from}} the pus in the purple wart (verruga peruana) of a female patient. [...] Carrión developed an acute form of bartonellosis now known as Carrion's disease or Oroya fever. [...] This is a rare disease found only in Peru and certain other parts of South America. [...] He kept detailed notes of his condition and succeeded in showing through this <b>self-experiment</b> that the chronic and acute forms were the same disease. [...] He died from the disease after several weeks. [...] A student who had assisted Carrion in carrying out this work {{was arrested and charged}} with murder, but later released.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{no formal}} {{definition}} of what constitutes self-experimentation. [...] A strict definition might limit it to cases {{where there is a}} single-subject experiment and the experimenter performs the procedure on himself. [...] A looser definition might include cases where the experimenters put themselves amongst the volunteers for the experiment. [...] According to S. C. Gandevia of the University of New South Wales, who was looking at the question from the perspective of ethics, it is only <b>self-experiment</b> if the would-be self-experimenter would be named as an author on any subsequent published paper. [...] That is, the person who would receive the academic credit for the experiment must also be the subject of it.|$|E

50|$|Dr. Neuringer has {{suggested}} that behavior analysis as a field might benefit from using experimental designs that explicitly and directly attempted to meliorate the condition of an experimental subject.

2500|$|In 1984 a Western Australian scientist, Dr Barry Marshall, {{discovered}} {{the link between}} Helicobacter pylori (at that time known as Campylobacter pylori) and gastritis.

His only option was self-experimentation: ethical measures forbade him from administering H. pylori to any other person. In 2005, Marshall and his long-time collaborator Robin Warren were awarded Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, [...] "for their discovery of the bacterium Helicobacter pylori and its role in gastritis and peptic ulcer disease".|$|R
50|$|Rodrigues {{observed}} that the understanding of an individual's expression required a hidden knowledge which inspired him {{to search for the}} development of concrete points in association with the understanding of human nature. Approaching art from a scientific point of view, he began with an objective idea that there are important understandings that have been excluded and should be included to the infinitive art of representation. He found that his research was related to science as he studied anatomy, dramaturgy and occasional points of life. Rodrigues initially, <b>self-experimented</b> his findings and techniques and expanded the study to volunteers.|$|R
