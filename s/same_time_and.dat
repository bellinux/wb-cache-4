5|$|A {{few years}} after {{starting}} work on the canal, the Member had an artificial lake built on a flat piece of land {{to the front of}} the mansion house. The landscape gardener William S Gilpin was carrying out work on the adjacent Strichen estate at about the <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> it is assumed he gave help with the work at Pitfour. The lake extends to almost 50 acres and was based on the artificial lake at Windsor Great Park.|$|E
5|$|By 1886 {{the four}} threequarter system had spread {{throughout}} Wales. First instituted by Cardiff RFC in 1884, {{the system was}} designed to allow Cardiff centres Frank Hancock and Tom Williams {{to play at the}} <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> involved dropping the ninth forward to include a second centre. Newport were reluctant to adopt this style of play, mainly due to Gould's excellent kicking and covering abilities, which allowed the club to continue with the advantage of the extra forward.|$|E

Strobe lights, smoke machines, and even Gibby Haynes' burning cymbal are still part of the presentation, but the chaotic spontaneity of their 1980s performances is no longer on display.|$|E

That same month, Qualcomm introduced a Snapdragon-based prototype netbook called Kayak that used 1.5GHz processors and was intended for developing markets.|$|E

It differs from the type species in the morphology of the braincase, as well as in several other characters of the skull such as the proportions of the premaxilla.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{the chalk}} cliff near the lower {{terminus}} collapsed in 1957, forcing the railway's closure while a strengthening concrete wall was built.

5|$|The {{effect of}} {{diffusion}} damping is greatly augmented by the finite {{width of the}} surface of last scattering (SLS). The finite width of the SLS means the CMB photons we see were not all emitted at the <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> the fluctuations we see are not all in phase. It also means that during recombination, the diffusion length changed dramatically, as the ionisation fraction shifted.|$|E

5|$|After a few warm up gigs {{towards the}} end of April, the group gave a preview concert to the press at Ronnie Scotts, London on 1 May. Realising the opera's {{narrative}} was difficult to understand, Townshend explained a synopsis of the story, before the Who played Tommy all the way through at full stage volume. The next day, the group flew out to New York to start the US tour, with the first gig on 9 May at the Grande Ballroom, Detroit. At the end of May, the group played four nights at the Kinetic Playground, Chicago, and they noticed the audience would all stand up at the <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> stay standing. This indicated that live performances of Tommy had a significant positive response.|$|E
5|$|Along with Company F, {{which had}} {{returned}} to the base camp, Carlson proceeded to the area where Company C was engaged, arriving at 16:30. Carlson ordered Company F to attack the Japanese positions facing Company C at 17:15. In the meantime, the Japanese troops departed the area, which Company F soon confirmed. Leaving Company F at the scene, Carlson returned to Binu with Company C, arriving at 22:00. Company E arrived at Binu about the <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> reported that they had caught a Japanese company crossing a river in the open and killed many of them before withdrawing. Carlson then took Company B and returned to the area that Company F was guarding, arriving at daybreak on 12 November. The Marines had suffered 10 killed in the day's actions and estimated that they had killed 120Japanese soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Although {{some historians}} have {{identified}} Garrard {{as a member}} of the Danville Political Club, a secret debating society that was active in Danville, Kentucky, from 1786 to 1790, his name is not found in the Club's official membership records. Garrard's biographer, H. E. Everman, concludes that these historians may have mistaken Garrard's membership in the Kentucky Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge for membership in the Danville Political Club. The groups had similar aims, were active at about the <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> had several members in common. Other notable members of the Kentucky Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge included Isaac Shelby, Christopher Greenup, and Thomas Todd, all future Kentucky governors or gubernatorial candidates.|$|E

With 120 known rooms, and excavation work still underway, it is probably the largest tomb in the valley. Originally opened (and robbed) in antiquity, it is a low-lying structure that has been particularly prone to the flash floods that sometimes hit the area. Tonnes of debris and material has washed in over the centuries, ultimately concealing its vast size. It is not currently open to the public.|$|E
5|$|Bradykinesia (slowness of movement) {{is found}} in every case of PD, and is due to {{disturbances}} in motor planning of movement initiation, and associated with difficulties along the whole course of the movement process, from planning to initiation to execution of a movement. Performance of sequential and simultaneous movement is impaired. Bradykinesia is the most handicapping symptom of Parkinson’s disease leading to difficulties with everyday tasks such as dressing, feeding, and bathing. It leads to particular difficulty in carrying out two independent motor activities at the <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> can be made worse by emotional stress or concurrent illnesses. Paradoxically patients with Parkinson's disease can often ride a bicycle or climb stairs more easily than walk on a level. While most physicians may readily notice bradykinesia, formal assessment requires a patient to do repetitive movements with their fingers and feet.|$|E
