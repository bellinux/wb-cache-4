40|$|Innovation is {{critical}} to the success of firms in this rapidly changing business environment. Despite this fact some firms fail to innovate and this affects the performance of such enterprises. The central theme of this <b>study</b> <b>is</b> to <b>boost</b> the service innovation capabilities of firms within the telecommunication industry in Ghana by encouraging cooperation between university and industries. This study dived into a theoretical approach to assess the state of service innovation, university and industry cooperation and its benefits towards developing firm’s innovation capabilities. Furthermore, the study proposes a cooperation framework involving all relevant actors from various stakeholders to facilitate university-industry cooperation within the telecommunication sector. The paper also formulated theoretical prepositions that can be tested empirically in further studies...|$|R

Retrieval of archived digital medical images {{is always a}} challenge that is still being researched {{all the more so}} as such images are of paramount importance in patient diagnosis, therapy, surgical planning, medical reference, and medical training. This paper proposes using the Discrete Sine Transform (DST) for relevant feature extraction, and applies Boosting classification tech-niques to locate the relevant images. In this <b>study,</b> the <b>boosting</b> <b>is</b> used with J 48 and decision stump. Experimental results show that the classification accuracy achieved is fairly good...|$|R
40|$|M. Tech. Tourism and Hospitality ManagementEducationally {{motivated}} mobility {{is one of}} {{the many}} reasons for human travel around the world. It is believed to be influenced by the push and pull factors that are bound in foreign students' countries, as well as receiving destinations. Developed countries like the USA, the UK, Australia and Canada have successfully utilised foreign students' mobility to reap financial benefits, as well as to create labour development opportunities. With twenty three public universities in South Africa, the number of foreign students here is perceived to represent only a very small part of the number of African students said to <b>be</b> <b>studying</b> outside of their own country. The aim of this <b>study</b> <b>is</b> to <b>boost</b> South African tourism, specifically tourism in the City of Tshwane, by increasing the number of foreign arrivals through increased foreign students, as well as attendant visit friends and relatives and youth travel. By means of a purposive sampling, this study examines the perceptions of 282 foreign students at the Tshwane University of Technology. The outcomes are encouraging, pointing to a bright future for tourism development by exploiting educational mobility. However, preconditions for this are the creation of the required infrastructure and the implementation of destination marketing...|$|R

40|$|The results {{based on}} a count {{coefficient}} for the linear regression equation by 0. 639. This suggests that in this equation the model of 0. 639 explained by {{the influence of the}} independent variables (the competence, independence and experience) on the dependent variable (performance inspectorate), while the remaining 36. 1 % is explained by other factors that are not included in this model, After testing the hypothesis with the t-test, it was concluded that the independence (X 2) and experience (X 3) significantly affect the performance of the inspectorate, while competence does not significantly affect the performance of the inspectorate. Furthermore, the F-test, showed that competence (X 1), independence (X 2) and experience (X 3) jointly affect the performance of the inspectorate. The degree of influence of each variable appears in the regression coefficient that is competence (X 1) of 0. 059; independence (X 2), amounting to 0. 748 and the regression coefficient of variable experience (X 3) of 1. 087. Implikasi findings of this <b>study</b> <b>is</b> to <b>boost</b> the performance of inspectorates to create good financial management with efforts to increase the independence, experience for inspectorates and with due regard to the competence of the inspectorate as a qualification for functional inspectorate.

40|$|The {{effects of}} a nonnegligible source impedance, due to the {{presence}} of an input EMI filter, on the stability of power factor preregulators (PFP’s) with average current control are analyzed by using a state-space averaged model. Differently from previous approaches, it allows us to derive a simple expression for the loop gain in terms of the converter current loop gain. The overall system stability <b>was</b> <b>studied</b> for <b>boost,</b> Cuk, and SEPIC PFP topologies. Based on this model, a simple modification of the standard current control loop is proposed which increases the converter robustness against instabilities. Comparison between model forecasts and experimental measurements was carried out using two prototypes, one based on the boost topology and the other based on the SEPIC topology, both rated at 600 W. Finally, the model accuracy was investigated with measurements at different current loop bandwidths...|$|R
