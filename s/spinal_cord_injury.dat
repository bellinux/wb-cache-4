40|$|Background: <b>Spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>injuries</b> {{are highly}} {{disabling}} and deadly injuries. Currently, few studies focus on non-traumatic <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>injuries,</b> {{and there is}} little information regarding the risk factors for complete injuries. This study aims to describe the demographics and the injury characteristics for both traumatic and non-traumatic <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>injuries</b> and to explore the risk factors for complete <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>injuries.</b> Methods: A retrospective study was performed by reviewing the medical records of 3, 832 patients with <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>injuries</b> who were first admitted to the sampled hospitals in Guangdong, China. The demographics and injury characteristics of the patients were described and compared between the different groups using the chi-square test. Logistic regression was conducted to analyze the risk factors for complete <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>injuries.</b> Results: The proportion of patients increased from 7. 0 % to 14. 0 % from 2003 to 2011. The male-to-female ratio was 3. 0 : 1. The major cause of <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>injuries</b> was traffic accidents (21. 7 %). Many of the injured were workers (36. 2 %), peasants (22. 8 %), and unemployed people (13. 9 %); these occupations accounted for 72. 9 % of the total sample. A multivariate logistic regression model revealed that the OR (95 % CI) for male gender compared to female gender was 1. 25 (1. 07 – 1. 89), the OR (95 %CI) for having a spinal fracture was 1. 56 (1. 35 – 2. 60), the OR (95 %CI) for having a thoracic injury was 1. 23 (1. 10 – 2. 00), and the OR (95 %CI) for having complications was 2. 47 (1. 96 – 3. 13) ...|$|R
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{injuries}} {{at or above}} the lumbar or sacral regions of the spinal cord (lower back and pelvis) include decreased control of the legs and hips, genitourinary system, and anus. People injured below level L2 may still have use of their hip flexor and knee extensor muscles. Bowel and bladder function are regulated by the sacral region. It is common to experience sexual dysfunction after injury, as well as dysfunction of the bowel and bladder, including fecal and urinary incontinence. It is also possible for the bladder to fail to empty, leading to a potentially harmful buildup of urine. One sign of <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>injury</b> that emergency providers may find is priapism, an erection of the penis.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>spinal</b> <b>cord</b> <b>injury</b> (SCI) often causes sexual dysfunction, {{many people}} with SCI are able to have {{satisfying}} sex lives. Physical limitations acquired from SCI affect sexual function and sexuality in broader areas, {{which in turn has}} important effects on quality of life. Damage to the spinal cord impairs its ability to transmit messages between the brain and parts of the body below the level of the lesion. This results in lost or reduced sensation and muscle motion, and affects orgasm, erection, ejaculation, and vaginal lubrication. More indirect causes of sexual dysfunction include pain, weakness, and side effects of medications. Psycho-social causes include depression and altered self-image. Many people with SCI have satisfying sex lives, and many experience sexual arousal and orgasm. People with SCI employ a variety of adaptations to help carry on their sex lives healthily, by focusing on different areas of the body and types of sexual acts. Neural plasticity may account for increases in sensitivity in parts of the body that have not lost sensation, so people often find newly sensitive erotic areas of the skin in erogenous zones or near borders between areas of preserved and lost sensation.|$|E
