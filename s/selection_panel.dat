5|$|At {{the start}} of the 1952–53 season, the New South Wales Cricket Association's five-man <b>selection</b> <b>panel</b> {{installed}} Miller as captain in place of Morris. This was despite Morris leading the state to the Sheffield Shield in the previous season. Miller did not lobby for the job, but the Sydney media had campaigned for Miller, suggesting that his flamboyant style would attract more spectators and help stem the financial losses of the NSWCA. Despite this, Morris remained the Test vice-captain ahead of Miller.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{disagreement}} {{as to whether}} Craig was deserving of the captaincy, the team proceeded smoothly without infighting. Prior to the Fifth Test, Craig wanted to drop himself due to poor form, which would have made Harvey captain. Peter Burge, the third member of the <b>selection</b> <b>panel</b> and a Harvey supporter, was comfortable with this, but Harvey relinquished his opportunity to seize the leadership by ordering Burge to retain Craig. When the vote was formally taken, Harvey and Burge outvoted Craig, who was still offering to drop himself.|$|E

5|$|In 1934, {{having been}} reappointed to a {{position}} on the <b>selection</b> <b>panel,</b> Woodfull led Australia back to England on a tour that had been under a cloud after the tempestuous cricket diplomacy of the previous bodyline series.

50|$|Throughout {{the history}} of the GAA teams were usually run by <b>selection</b> <b>panels.</b> These groups {{generally}} had five members, however, on some occasions there could be up to ten selectors. These large <b>selection</b> <b>panels</b> often resulted in self-interest overtaking sound judgement. On many occasions certain selectors could be accused of favouring players from their own clubs. By the early 1970s the GAA began to take note of the merits of having an all-powerful soccer-style manager accompanied by assistants. In 1973 Dublin appointed Kevin Heffernan as manager of their football team. It {{was the first time in}} the GAA’s history that a manager with substantial powers was appointed.|$|R

5|$|Miller was {{selected}} for an Australian XIa team comprising a mix of established international representatives and fringe playersfixture against the tourists prior to the Test series, but made only five runs with the bat and bowled only four overs, taking 0/8 in a rain-affected match that did not reach the second innings. In a Shield match against South Australia—led by national captain Don Bradman—at the Adelaide Oval, Miller {{had a chance to}} push for selection by performing well in front of the Australian captain, who was {{also a member of the}} three-man national <b>selection</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|E
5|$|He was an Australian {{selector}} from 1967 to 1979. Immediately {{after his}} appointment, he was embroiled in controversy during the First Test against India at Brisbane in 1967–68. The Queensland Cricket Association {{wrote to the}} board, complaining that Harvey, who was the selector on duty at the Test, had missed two hours of play. He had been at a race meeting {{at the invitation of}} the QCA president. The ACB gave Harvey a talking to. Despite this, he retained his position at the next annual election, with Queensland's Ken Mackay failing to gain a seat on the <b>selection</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|E
5|$|On September 5, 2008, Harper {{nominated}} Thomas Cromwell of Nova Scotia Court of Appeal to {{fill the}} Supreme Court seat left vacant by the departure of Michel Bastarache. By and large Cromwell's nomination was well received, with many lauding the selection; however, dissent has been noted surrounding the nomination. First, Harper bypassed parliament's supreme court <b>selection</b> <b>panel,</b> {{which was supposed to}} produce a list of three candidates for him to choose from. Second, Newfoundland justice minister Jerome Kennedy criticized the appointment, citing the Newfoundland government's belief that constitutional convention stipulates that a Newfoundlander should have been named to the court in the rotation of Atlantic Canadian supreme court representation.|$|E

5|$|From 1971 onwards, Harvey was the {{chairman}} of selectors. It was a tumultuous period in Australian cricket, where captain Bill Lawry was acrimoniously sacked {{in the middle of the}} 1970–71 series against England after a dispute between players and Australian officials. Lawry was not informed of his fate and learned of his omission on the radio when he was still one of Australia's most productive batsmen. The dispute was the genesis of the pay dispute which, led to the formation of World Series Cricket in 1977 and generated a mass exodus of players. This resulted in the recall of Bob Simpson after ten years in retirement at the age of 41 to captain the Test team. Following the rapprochement between the establishment and the WSC players, Harvey left the <b>selection</b> <b>panel.</b> The WSC representatives felt that Harvey's anti-WSC comments made him prejudiced against the selection of former WSC players.|$|E

Then, in February 1972, Sir Rudolf Peierls and Nicholas Kurti informed her that the University of Oxford had created a new chair in the history of science, {{the first of its kind}} in the university's long history. She did not expect to get the chair, but Peierls, Sir Frederick Dainton and Hugh Trevor-Roper were on the <b>selection</b> <b>panel,</b> and in the end offered the chair in the history of science to Gowing, a woman who did not have a degree in history or science.|$|E
5|$|The {{award was}} {{established}} in 1975 and {{is given to the}} person(s) chosen as the best high school boys' basketball senior in the U.S. state of Minnesota.

A nine-member selection committee, headed by Ken Lien since 1977, has selected five finalists in March of every year since the award began. Those five finalists are chosen from a larger pool of 15 finalists picked in January, and the winner of the award is named in April. In order to select the most deserving student-athlete, the <b>selection</b> <b>panel</b> watches over 120 high school basketball games and creates detailed reviews on every one of them.

5|$|He was a Test {{selector}} for the Australian {{team from}} 1970 to 1981, filling the vacancy {{left by the}} retirement of former Test captain Ryder. Loxton's tenure on the <b>selection</b> <b>panel</b> coincided with a period of great upheaval in Australian cricket, {{on and off the}} field. Up until 1965, Australia had never lost a Test series to any country other than England, and their bilateral contests were regarded as the de facto world championship. However, in the next five years, Australia lost away to the West Indies 2–1, and to South Africa twice, 3–1 and 4–0 respectively. The former all-rounder became a selector after the whitewash in South Africa, joining Bradman and Harvey on the panel. During the 1970–71 home series against England, which Australia lost 2–1, the trio made a raft of changes, handing debuts to nine players, the largest number in a season since 1945–46 when competition resumed after World War II. One of the new players that Harvey and Loxton recommended to Bradman was Dennis Lillee, who went on to become one of Australia's greatest fast bowlers and the world’s leading wicket-taker. However, the season ended acrimoniously when captain Bill Lawry was sacked before the final Test without being informed of his fate; he only learned of his omission second hand.|$|E
5|$|In {{their first}} season the Highlanders were coached by Gordon Hunter before {{he joined the}} All Blacks <b>selection</b> <b>panel.</b> Glen Ross took over in 1997, and was not re{{appointed}} for the 1998 season. Tony Gilbert was appointed for the 1998 season, and again coached the team in 1999 before being appointed co-coach for the All Blacks. Peter Sloane was appointed Gilbert's successor for the 2000 season, and also coached them in 2001 before moving to coach the Blues. Laurie Mains returned to New Zealand from South Africa to replace Sloane for the 2002 season. Mains resigned following the 2003 season after a rift between him and senior players. Greg Cooper replaced Mains and coached the team from 2003 until 2007, {{when he left the}} franchise to take up the assistant coaches position with the Blues. Glenn Moore coached the club from 2008 through until 2010, when he was relieved of his duties after the club posted only 10 wins against 29 losses in his three years in charge. His replacement was former All Black flanker Jamie Joseph, who coached between 2011 and 2016. Tony brown took over as head coach in 2017.|$|E
5|$|England {{made three}} further changes. Spinner Jack Young and paceman Dick Pollard {{replaced}} the spin pair of Doug Wright and Jim Laker in the bowling department, meaning England would only play one slow bowler. Wright and Laker had struggled {{to penetrate the}} Australian batting lineup in the Second Test, taking match figures of 2/123 and 2/128 respectively. In contrast, Pollard had taken match figures of 4/85 for Lancashire in a match against Australia earlier in the season, and had taken 27 wickets in four county matches in the past fortnight. The selection was seen as being influenced by the fact the Test was being staged at Lancashire's home ground, where Pollard {{was familiar with the}} conditions, and the Australians had a high regard for him. In the month since being dropped for the Second Test in favour of Wright, after taking 1/107 in the First Test, Young had returned to play for Middlesex, taking 27 wickets in five matches. Alec Coxon, the Yorkshire allrounder who made his Test debut in the previous match at Lord's and opened the bowling, taking match figures of 3/172 and scoring 19 and a duck, was replaced by Jack Crapp, a debutant batsman. Crapp had scored 100 not out and 32 for Gloucestershire in the preceding match against the tourists. It was only the third century scored against Australia during the tour, and was part of a season in which Crapp had made four centuries and six half-centuries in 16 matches thus far. Coxon's omission was believed to have been caused more by off-field events than sporting merit. There was a story that he punched Denis Comptonwhom he disliked and considered self-importantin the dressing room, but Coxon always denied this. However, there was certainly an altercation and Coxon was never selected again. O'Reilly interpreted the omission of the Yorkshiremen Hutton and Coxon {{at the expense of the}} Gloucestershire pair of Crapp and Emmett as symptoms of a regional bias in the English <b>selection</b> <b>panel.</b> He pointed out that only one of the four selectorsEngland captain Norman Yardley, who was also from Yorkshirewas from the north of the country.|$|E
