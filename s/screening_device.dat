25|$|In operation, the raw {{material}} (of various sizes) is usually delivered to the primary crusher's hopper by dump trucks, excavators or wheeled front-end loaders. A feeder device such as an apron feeder, conveyor or vibrating grid controls {{the rate at which}} this material enters the crusher, and often contains a preliminary <b>screening</b> <b>device</b> which allows smaller material to bypass the crusher itself, thus improving efficiency. Primary crushing reduces the large pieces to a size which can be handled by the downstream machinery.|$|E
2500|$|In Canada, a {{preliminary}} non-evidentiary <b>screening</b> <b>device</b> can {{be approved by}} Parliament as an approved <b>screening</b> <b>device,</b> and an evidentiary breath instrument can be similarly designated as an approved instrument. [...] The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration maintains a Conforming Products List of breath alcohol devices approved for evidentiary use, {{as well as for}} preliminary screening use. In order to demand a person produce a breathalyzer sample an officer must have [...] "reasonable suspicion" [...] that the person drove with more than 80mg alcohol per 100 mL of blood. The demand must be within three hours of driving. Any driver that refuses can be charged under s.254 of the Criminal Code. Most states, including California and Michigan, have implied consent laws, which means that by applying for a driver's license, drivers are agreeing to take any breathalyzer test under suspicion of a DUI. However, if the officer lacks reasonable suspicion and the person refuses there is no crime since the demand was not lawful and without the breathalyzer readings there is usually not probable grounds for arrest on the above driving over 80 charge.|$|E

40|$|Given the {{increasing}} use of small <b>screen</b> <b>devices</b> to gather and provide important information, a critical question is how learning and problem solving performance is impacted by collecting data on a small device. This study investigates how learning and application of information differs when it is gathered using a small <b>screen</b> <b>device</b> versus a normal size desktop display. Results indicate that while factual recall is equivalent across interfaces, small <b>screen</b> <b>devices</b> appear to reduce how well participants apply these rules towards correct solutions. Further, it appears that solution time is also increased by using a small <b>screen</b> <b>device.</b> These results suggest that while these small technologies are convenient for fact gathering and other simple uses, there is a potential tradeoff when this learned information must be used in complex and appropriate ways...|$|R

40|$|Small <b>screen</b> <b>devices</b> like {{cellular}} phones or Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) are the artifacts {{of information technology}} almost everybody carries around today. Together with wireless networks they are the ubiquitous gateway to information and services. Especially the increasing bandwidth together with the improving processing power of these devices supply us with capabilities known only from desktop computers {{a couple of years}} ago. However, the access to rich multimedia content using these devices is almost impossible due to the physical limitations without performing lossy content reduction. An idea to overcome these limitations results from the observation that our daily life is surrounded by information technology almost everywhere, e. g. PC’s, Laptops TV sets, public terminals, etc [...] These “larger <b>screen</b> <b>devices</b> ” can be used in conjunction with the small <b>screen</b> <b>device</b> to extend its capabilities and to provide access to rich multimedia content and services without any sacrifice. In order to do so the small <b>screen</b> <b>device</b> must be able to access these devices and to remotely control them. UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) [1] is a technology, which connects appliances on an adhoc basis. In this paper we will present our concept of ad-hoc personal ubiquitous multimedia services and illustrate an UPnP based implementation, which allows users a high degree of mobility and in parallel facilitates the access of rich multimedia contents by using a small <b>screen</b> <b>device.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|This DRUID {{workshop}} {{was held}} in Geneva, 23 August 2009. Task 3. 2 is part of ‘Work package 3 – Enforcement’ of the EU funded integrated project DRUID. DRUID is a project in the 6 th framework programme focussed on establishing guidelines and measures to combat impaired driving. The purpose of task 3. 2 is to evaluate the analytical reliability of {{a limited number of}} promising on-site oral fluid <b>screening</b> <b>devices.</b> This task is closely linked to task 3. 1, the practical evaluation of on-site oral <b>screening</b> <b>devices,</b> since it was necessary to ensure that the findings from both studies were comparable. Hence the devices evaluated in task 3. 2 were selected from only those oral <b>screening</b> <b>devices</b> which were deemed as promising devices in task 3. 1. Further the results of both the practical and analytical evaluation of oral fluid <b>screening</b> <b>devices</b> (tasks 3. 1 and 3. 2 respectively) will serve as input to the cost-benefit analyses of task 3. 3 “Cost-benefit analyses”.
