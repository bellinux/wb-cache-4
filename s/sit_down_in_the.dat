25|$|The port {{was under}} the control of the Haitian {{government}} of Toussaint Louverture, which threw the crew of the privateer into prison. The men from Bordelais spent four months in prison but were well treated, with Gordon and the midshipman being permitted to move freely on parole. Eventually all were released to a cartel under the command of Captain Kelpoisson, the commander of the port of Aux Cayes, and the only Frenchman in a position of authority. The British arrived at Port Royal (except for one man who had died), where they found out that the war was over. They returned to Bordelais, where Gordon was able to <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> officers' mess before any of his fellow officers even knew that he had returned.|$|E
500|$|Although the Pittston strike {{involved}} coal miners, many of {{the supporters}} of the strike were not miners at all. A majority of the support that the union members received was from women, who were a pivotal aspect of the strike. Many of these women were either wives or daughters of miners who worked for Pittston, but some women supporters had no affiliation with Pittston Coal Company or mining at all. The women would <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of roads causing blockages while others would drive slowly in front of coal trucks to cause delays. Two famous groups of women supporters arose during this time; [...] "The Daughters of Mother Jones" [...] and [...] "The Freedom Fighters". At {{the peak of the}} strike around 500 women were involved in supporting the miners, most of them housewives.|$|E
2500|$|Former {{party leader}} and prime {{minister}} James Callaghan said that a ballot was needed to decide when to end the strike and return to work. Tony Benn was vocal in support of Scargill's leadership during the strike. [...] In addition, 12 left-wing MPs refused to <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Commons in January {{in an attempt to}} force a debate on the strike.|$|E

2500|$|After his release, Paige {{played for}} several Mobile semi-pro teams. He joined the semi-pro Mobile Tigers where his brother Wilson was already pitching. He also pitched for a semi-pro team named the Down the Bay Boys, and he {{recalled}} that he once got into a jam {{in the ninth inning}} of a 1–0 ballgame when his teammates made three consecutive errors, loading the bases for the other team with two outs. Angry, Paige said he stomped around the mound, kicking up dirt. The fans started booing him, so he decided that [...] "somebody {{was going to have to}} be showed up for that." [...] He called in his outfielders and had them <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> infield. With the fans and his own teammates howling, Paige struck out the final batter, winning the game.|$|E
2500|$|Though {{obviously}} {{the foundation and}} progeny curse {{was not the only}} religious invocation by the political powers during the Akkadian empire, it demonstrates a certain standardization, and with it, stagnation, of the position of the gods that likely did not sit well with the people of Lagaš. Ur-Ningirsu I, with whom the Gudean dynasty of Lagaš begins, leaves {{little in the way of}} inscriptions, and though some mention of various gods seems to indicate a more central role, it is not until Gudea that there can be a side-by-side comparison with the old curse of Sargon. The inscription on a statue of Gudea as architect of the House of Ningirsu, warns the reader of doom if the words are altered, but there is a startling difference between the warnings of Sargon or his line and the warnings of Gudea. The one is length; Gudea’s curse lasts nearly a quarter of the inscription’s considerable length, and another is creativity. The gods will not merely reduce the offender’s progeny to ash and destroy his foundations, no, they will, [...] "let him <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dust instead of on the seat they set up for him". He will be [...] "slaughtered like a bull… seized like an aurochs by his fierce horn".|$|E
2500|$|Arne De Boever {{believes}} {{that there is a}} [...] "close affinity, and intimacy even, between the sheriff and Chigurh in No Country for Old Men [...] in a number of scenes. There is, to begin with, the sheriff's voice {{at the beginning of the}} film, which accompanies the images of Chigurh's arrest. This initial weaving together of the figures of Chigurh and the sheriff is further developed later on in the film, when the sheriff visits Llewelyn Moss' trailer home in search for Moss and his wife, Carla Jean. Chigurh has visited the trailer only minutes before, and the Coen brothers have the sheriff <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same exact spot where Chigurh had been sitting (which is almost the exact same spot where, the evening before, Moss joined his wife on the couch). Like Chigurh, the sheriff sees himself reflected in the dark glass of Moss' television, their mirror images perfectly overlapping if one were to superimpose these two shots. When the sheriff pours himself a glass of milk from the bottle that stands sweating on the living room table—a sign that the sheriff and his colleague, deputy Wendell (Garret Dillahunt), only just missed their man—this mirroring of images goes beyond the level of reflection, and Chigurh enters into the sheriff's constitution, thus further undermining any easy opposition of Chigurh and the sheriff, and instead exposing a certain affinity, intimacy, or similarity even between both." ...|$|E
