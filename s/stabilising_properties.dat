This distinguishes our model from {{others in the}} so called New Open Economy Macroeconomics and makes it a suitable framework within which analyse the <b>stabilising</b> <b>properties</b> of monetary policies. We show that the variance of inflation induced by domestic inflationary shocks is lower under CPI targeting than when we target a measure of output price inflation. In fact, market segmentation and staggered wage and price setting result in lower and more persistent foreign inflation responses to a domestic inflationary shocks. This inertia in foreign price adjustments is completely passed through into CPI inflation but not into output price inflation. These differences cannot be detected in traditional models that usually introduce sluggish adjustments of domestic output prices as {{the only source of}} inertia.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the sensitivity of}} steric <b>stabilising</b> <b>properties</b> of protein–polysaccharide conjugates, prepared via the Maillard reactions, {{to the presence of}} sugar impurity during synthesis. The sugar can also react with protein, thus rendering potential sites on protein unavailable for linkage with polysaccharide and severely reducing the efficiency of producing these types of food dispersants. We demonstrate that despite the presence of a relatively high molar ratio of lactose contaminant to maltodextrin (10 : 1), the covalent complexes between maltodextrin DE 19 (MD 19) and Whey Protein Isolate (WPI) are still formed and continue to show superior emulsifying and colloid <b>stabilising</b> <b>properties</b> compared to native protein. The improvement was particularly marked under unfavourable environmental conditions, such as pH pI of protein, up to a storage time of 21 days. In contrast, the covalent complexes of lactose + WPI were found to have rather poor emulsion stabilising characteristics, under the same conditions. We also confirm this result by performing theoretical Self Consistent Field type calculations. The stability of emulsions was monitored using a variety of measures including the average droplet size (ADS), droplet-size distribution (DSD), rheological flow behaviours and confocal laser imaging microscopy. The suggestion that the WPI-MD 19 (1 : 2, w/w) system is quite tolerant to the presence of lactose is of significance in future large scale industrial manufacturing of such food dispersants, due to less stringent requirements for the purity of raw material (WPI) ...|$|E

This paper looks at the socioeconomic context of wild berry-picking, and asks whether the principle of allemansrätt – a Nordic tradition of public access to nature – played a role in why wild berries did not become private property.

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} the price-volume {{relationship}} focus only on the total volume of transactions without taking into account {{of the nature of}} these transactions. While this is a reasonable approach for financial markets, such approach may have ignore some important information in the property market. We examine price-volume relation in Hong Kong property market using transaction based repeat-sales index and volume of different types of transactions. Our study distinguishes itself from others in several ways. Firstly, we have analysed the impacts of three different types of transactions (normal transactions, pre-sale transactions and confirmor transactions) on the transaction prices. Secondly, both the first and second moment effects of volume on prices are examined. Thirdly, we have also tested for structural breaks in the price volume relationships. Our data show that total transaction volume leads price, which is consistent with the search model. We found that pre-sale transactions depress spot market returns while confirmor transactions do the opposite; and that confirmor transactions <b>stabilise</b> <b>property</b> prices while pre-sales transactions increases price volatility. We propose that developerís pricing strategies have {{played an important role in}} explaining the effects of presale transaction on the first and second moment of property prices. Developers under-price their unfinished units as a means of promoting sales of their unsold units. Thus, presale transactions have an negative impact on property price returns. However, the extent of under pricing varies across different developers and phases of pre-sale, therefore as the volume of presale transaction increases, the volatility of property prices also increases. Confirmor transactions are speculative forward contract transactions and are priced in the market like other completed units. The stabilising effects of confirmor transactions are consistent with results in finance literature that transactions in the futures market stabilise spot market prices. The positive impact of confirmor transactions on property price returns is due to the incomplete nature of the property market ñ impossibility of short selling. Speculators can only speculate up but not down. We have found structural breaks in the relationships between transaction volume and property prices during the period of Asian Financial Crisis (AFC). The AFC has introduced unexpected exchange rate risks and increased the volatility interest rates. However, the above results are not materially affected by replacing structural break dummy variable with interest rate. The nature of the structural breaks remains an area for further studies...|$|R

Asynchronous species dynamics can maintain stability (i. e. invariability in aggregate properties) through temporal complementarities between species with different environmental tolerances. Few manipulative studies have, however, tested in natural conditions the response of this mechanism to multiple stressors. In field experiments we tested the separate and interactive effects of two stressors associated with storminess—loss of a canopy-forming species and mechanical disturbances—on species synchrony and community respiration of intertidal hard-bottom communities on Helgoland Island, NE Atlantic.

Experiments at two sites consistently showed that canopy loss significantly reduced species synchrony. Mechanical disturbance had neither separate nor interactive effects on species synchrony. Accordingly, in situ measurements of CO 2 -fluxes showed that canopy loss, but not mechanical disturbances, significantly reduced temporal variation in community respiration during emersion periods. Our results support the idea that compensatory dynamics may <b>stabilise</b> aggregate <b>properties.</b> They further suggest that the ecological consequences of the loss of a single structurally important species may be stronger than those derived from smaller-scale mechanical disturbances in natural ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was on the effects of {{plasticisers}} (the ionic liquid 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium acetate, or [Emim][OAc]; and glycerol) on the changes of starch structure on multiple length scales, and the variation in properties of plasticised starch-based films, during ageing. The films were prepared by a simple melt compression moulding process, followed by storage at different relative humidity (RH) environments. Compared with glycerol, [Emim][OAc] could result in greater homogeneity in [Emim][OAc]-plasticised starch-based films (no gel-like aggregates and less molecular order (crystallites) on the nano-scale). Besides, much weaker starch-starch interactions but stronger starch-[Emim][OAc] interactions at the molecular level led to reduced strength and stiffness but increased flexibility of the films. More importantly, [Emim][OAc] (especially at high content) was revealed to more effectively maintain the plasticised state during ageing than glycerol: the densification (especially in the amorphous regions) was suppressed; and the structural characteristics especially on the nano-scale were stabilised (especially at a high RH), presumably due to the suppressed starch molecular interactions by [Emim][OAc] as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. Such behaviour contributed to <b>stabilised</b> mechanical <b>properties.</b> Nonetheless, the crystallinity and thermal stability of starch-based films with both plasticisers were much less affected by ageing and moisture uptake during storage (42 days), but mostly depended on the plasticiser type and content.

Both modern and historic, hardwood and softwood samples were successfully hydrated using this technique. The addition of a co-solvent (methanol) to the supercritical fluid solvent stream was used as a method to increase the solubility of water in carbon dioxide, and therefore improve levels of hydration. To evaluate the extent of any damage being caused during the supercritical fluid treatment, microstructural and macrostructural analytical techniques were carried out.

40|$|Length and {{intensity}} of signal transduction via cytokine receptors is precisely regulated. Degradation of certain cytokine receptors is mediated by the ubiquitin ligase SCF(βTrCP). In several instances, Janus kinase (Jak) family members can stabilise their cognate cytokine receptors at the cell surface. In this study we show in Hek 293 cells that Jak 2 binding to the growth hormone receptor prevents endocytosis in a non-catalytic manner. Following receptor activation, the detachment of phosphorylated Jak 2 induces down-regulation of the growth hormone receptor by SCF(βTrCP). Using γ 2 A human fibroblast cells we show that both growth hormone-induced and constitutive growth hormone receptor endocytosis depend on the same factors, strongly suggesting that the modes of endocytosis are identical. Different Jak 2 RNA levels in HepG 2, IM 9 and Hek 293 cells indicate the importance of cellular concentration on growth hormone receptor function. Both Jak 2 and βTrCP bind to neighbouring linear motifs in the growth hormone receptor tail without the requirement of modifications, indicating that growth hormone sensitivity is regulated by the cellular level of non-committed Jak 2.

The peak loads and torques were higher for the lag screw, but were similar for both devices after 8 rum deformation. The stiffness was higher for the lag screw, but in counter-clockwise rotation the stiffness for the lag screw was negligible. The twin hook appeared to provide fixation stability comparable to that offered by the lag screw, but with conceivable advantages in terms of a deformation response involving bone impaction and gradually increasing stability...|$|E
40|$|We {{have carried}} out a {{numerical}} simulation {{of the effect of}} gold doping on the electrical characteristics of long silicon diodes exposed to neutron irradiation. The aim is to investigate the effect of gold on the hardness of the irradiated diodes. The reverse current voltage and capacitance voltage characteristics of doped and undoped diodes are calculated for different irradiation doses. The leakage current and the effective doping density are extracted from these two characteristics respectively. The hardness of the diodes is evaluated from the evolution of the leakage current and the effective doping density with irradiation doses. It was found that diodes doped with gold are less sensitive to irradiation than undoped ones. Thus gold appears to <b>stabilise</b> the electrical <b>properties</b> on irradiation. The conduction mechanism is studied by the evolution of the current with temperature. The evaluated activation energy indicates that as the gold doping or irradiation dose increases, the current switches from the basic diffusion to the generation-recombination process, and that it can even become ohmic for very high gold densities or irradiation doses...|$|R
40|$|The {{necessity}} for economically feasible landfill {{operations for the}} safe disposal/use of municipal sludges has become of paramount importance {{as a result of}} increasing environmental requirements augmenting the quantities of concentrated sludges being produced. Effective landfill designs necessitate a thorough understanding of treated sludge behaviour which is presently fragmented and limited. This project sets out to determine the drying characteristics, pertinent engineering properties and courses of action for the safe storage and landfilling of <b>stabilised</b> sludge. Geotechnical <b>properties</b> are presented, which when applied to the design of landfill areas, will increase deposit stability, decrease volume, control leachate and maximise the life of the landfill site. The results indicated that sludge dried slowly being inhibited by low permeability. Processed material was generally difficult to compact and highly compressible, consolidating {{over a long period of}} time with substantial secondary compression. Strength was time dependent with fibre decomposition and undrained creep reducing strength with elapsed time causing long-term instability in sludge landfills. A short-term stability analysis indicated minimum strengths for handling and trafficability requirements were governing factors controlling sludge moisture content for landfill...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This {{research}} was aimed {{to investigate the}} mechanism of Ni 3 Al phase precipitation during long-term process of ageing Cu-Ni-Al. type alloys with particular account of the precipitates morphology changes, including the changes in their size with varying temperature and ageing time, so as to determine an effect of the elastic strain energy on these changes. Design/methodology/approach: Samples of cold-rolled strips from the CuNi 16 Al 5 alloy were solution – treated at 900 °C for 1 h in argon atmosphere, water quenched and next aged at the temperatures of 450 and 550 °C for up to 380 and 760 hours, respectively. Their microstructure was investigated by transmission electron microscopy. Findings: It was found that decomposition of supersaturated solid solution proceeds by nucleation and growth of the coherent precipitates of the L 12 –Ni 3 Al phase. Their morphology changes {{as a result of}} competitive influence of an elastic strain energy, surface energy on the matrix-precipitate inter-phase boundary, and the energy of elastic interaction between precipitates. The L 12 –Ni 3 Al precipitates nucleate as the spherical ones and grow, forming intermediate sub-structures, until they reach a cubic form with the planes parallel to the{ 100 } planes of a matrix and take privileged positions along the directions. Clear deviations from the LSW coagulation theory and its modifications, demonstrated by the slow-down of the process, have been observed. In the extreme case, growth of the precipitates can be completely stopped in some time ranges of the ageing process. Research limitations/implications: Further research should be concentrated on the precipitation kinetics within a wider range of volumetric fraction of the Ni 3 Al phase in a copper matrix. Practical implications: This effect can be used in practice to <b>stabilise</b> mechanical <b>properties</b> at elevated temperature. Originality/value: The paper contributes to better understanding of the precipitation mechanism in the alloys examined...|$|R
