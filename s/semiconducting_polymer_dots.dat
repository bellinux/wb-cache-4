40|$|Near-IR (NIR) {{emitting}} <b>semiconducting</b> <b>polymer</b> <b>dots</b> (Pdots) with ultrabright fluorescence {{have been}} prepared for specific cellular targeting. A series of π-conjugated polymers were synthesized to form water dispersible multicomponent Pdots by an ultrasonication-assisted co-precipitation method. By optimizing cascade energy transfer in Pdots, high-intensity NIR fluorescence (Φ = 0. 32) with tunable excitations, large absorption–emission separation (up to 330 nm), and narrow emission bands (FWHM = 44 nm) have been achieved. Single-particle fluorescence imaging show that the as-prepared NIR Pdots were {{more than three times}} brighter than the commercially available Qdot 705 with comparable sizes under identical conditions of excitation and detection. Because of the covalent introduction of carboxylic acid groups into polymer side chains, the bioconjugation between NIR-emitting Pdots and streptavidins can be readily completed via these functional groups on the surface of Pdots. Furthermore, through flow cytometry and confocal fluorescence microscopy the NIR-emitting Pdot–streptavidin conjugates proved that they could effectively label EpCAM receptors on the surface of MCF- 7 cells, via specific binding between streptavidin and biotin...|$|E

In this paper, <b>semiconducting</b> <b>polymers</b> based on well-known pigments, namely, quinacridone and diketopyrrolopyrrole, are synthesized and characterized. The π-stacking distances are found to be 3. 5 – 3. 8 Å, which is fairly narrow for <b>semiconducting</b> <b>polymers,</b> indicating that they possess strong intermolecular interactions. Interestingly, polymer orientation is influenced by the composition of alkyl side chains. While the edge-on orientation is observed when the linear alkyl groups are introduced for all the side chains, the face-on orientation is observed when the branched alkyl groups are introduced either in the quinacridone or diketopyrrolopyrrole unit. It is found that the electronic structure of the present polymers is mostly affected by that of the diketopyrrolopyrrole unit, as evidenced by the absorption spectra and computation.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the charge transport phenomenon in <b>semiconducting</b> <b>polymer</b> materials. In these disordered systems both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters play significant roles. In general, π -electron delocalization, interchain interaction, band gap, carrier density, extent of disorder, morphology and processing of materials determine the electrical and optical properties. The chemical structure, especially the role of side groups, is quite important in both physical and processing properties. The nature of charge carriers and their role in charge transport depend on the structure and morphology of the system. Hence in several <b>semiconducting</b> <b>polymer</b> devices, the correlations among structure, morphology and transport are rather strong. The dependence of carrier mobility on temperature and electric field needs to be understood in the framework of competing models based on carrier hopping, trapping/detrapping and tunneling.

In {{order to make}} progress on either of these fronts, a clear understanding of frontier molecular orbital energy levels in <b>semiconducting</b> <b>polymers</b> is key, which is one issue that this thesis aims to address. Less understood is what role energetics plays in operational stability, which is another issue that this thesis aims to address. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to study the effect of relative <b>semiconducting</b> <b>polymer</b> crystallinity on highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels in neat films.

40|$|The {{development}} of organic semiconductors {{is an important}} and challenging topic of the modern microelectronics since they can be applied as active layers in devices combining the advantages of easy processing, low weight, mechanical flexibility and ability of properties-tuning by structural modifications. A spectacular example for these attractive properties are the organic field effect transistors (OFETs) which are highly important components and recently have been a subject to a significant technological development. Particularly attractive candidates for OFET-applications are the <b>semiconducting</b> <b>polymers</b> due to their simple, low-cost solution processing, at low temperatures that enable large-area deposition on broad range of substrates. Typically, the reports of the <b>semiconducting</b> <b>polymers,</b> as of most organic materials, discuss unipolar charge transport. The result are devices, that can operate either in p- or n-channel regime, based on charge transport of holes or el ectrons, respectively. However the availability of both charge transport types {{is necessary for the}} realisation of numerous important logic elements, such as p-n junction structures, bipolar transistors and complementary circuits. The research attention so far has been oriented predominantly towards the p-type <b>semiconducting</b> <b>polymers.</b> As a result a significant progress has been marked with the achievement of fieldeffect mobilities of up to 0. 05 - 0. 1 cm 2 /V·s as reported for the regioregularpoly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) [1].

40|$|Efficiency, current throughput, {{and speed}} of {{electronic}} devices are {{to a great extent}} dictated by charge carrier mobility. The classic approach to impart high carrier mobility to polymeric semiconductors has often relied on the assumption that extensive order and crystallinity are needed. Recently, however, this assumption has been challenged, because high mobility has been reported for <b>semiconducting</b> <b>polymers</b> that exhibit a surprisingly low degree of order. Here, we show that <b>semiconducting</b> <b>polymers</b> can be confined into weakly ordered fibers within an inert polymer matrix without affecting their charge transport properties. In these conditions, the <b>semiconducting</b> <b>polymer</b> chains are inhibited from attaining long-range order in the p-stacking or alkyl-stacking directions, as demonstrated from the absence of significant X-ray diffraction intensity corresponding to these crystallographic directions, yet still remain extended along the backbone direction and aggregate on a local length scale. As a result, the polymer films maintain high mobility even at very low concentrations. Our findings provide a simple picture that clarifies the role of local order and connectivity of domains.

Complementary DNA (cDNA) was conjugated to silver nanoparticles (cDNA-AgNPs) which act as FRET acceptors. Mixed in solution, {{in the absence}} of AFB 1, the aptamer and its cDNA hybridize to form (aptamer-cDNA). This brings the <b>polymer</b> <b>dots</b> into close proximity of the AgNPs and result in FRET from the donor to the acceptor due to spectral overlap between the emission of the <b>polymer</b> <b>dots</b> and the absorption of the AgNPs. The fluorescence of the <b>polymer</b> <b>dots</b> probe is thereby switched off. However, in the presence of AFB 1, the aptamer with high affinity for AFB 1 will be released from the cDNA-AgNP aggregate, which results in recovery of fluorescence (“switch on” state).
