25|$|By {{the will}} of my {{commander}} in chief, I have come to release the ownership over the Talysh regions {{from the hands of}} the Persians and therefore must take Lankaran. Knowing you are a valiant and prudent leader, I consider it necessary to warn that your resistance will be in vain. Even though you may be a great military leader, but you are no better than Abbas Mirza, who lost at Aslanduz and with that ten thousand soldiers, 500 men as prisoners, all the banners, weapons of which the troops don't have to their disposal right now. As it was at Aslanduz, where here barely escaped along with the 20th horsemen regiment and fled to Tabriz, while he had thirty thousand men at his disposal, and we had just two thousand men. Warriors of the great almighty in the world the Russian emperor crashed Abbas Mirza to pieces, and now they are located here, at the Talysh Khanate. So, when Abbas Mirza could not resist our victorious weapons, despite the fact that his troops outnumbered ours by fifteen times, you reflect that you won't be able either to inflict us a mortal blow here; so I <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> agree to voluntarily surrender the fortress to avoid harmful and unnecessary bloodshed, sparing both Abbas Mirza's as well as my warriors. Consider of what you will reach by following sanity, namely saving lives, dignity, and both your property and all affiliated parties' properties in this conflict; otherwise, you will lose everything, if you won't attend the voice of common sense. But it is my duty to tell you, as you will be the one to choose; only I shall be justified in front of God and humanity. I'm ordered not to bombard yet by this letter until I receive response and receipt within three hours.|$|E
500|$|Recalling {{the release}} {{in his book}} Revolution in the Head, Ian MacDonald writes that, with Revolver, the Beatles [...] "had {{initiated}} a second pop revolution – one which while galvanising their existing rivals and inspiring many new ones, left all of them far behind". In a February 1967 review, Hit Parader declared: [...] "Revolver represents the pinnacle of pop music. No group has been as consistently creative as the Beatles, though the [...] Spoonful and Beach Boys are coming closer all the time... Rather than analyze the music we just <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> listen to Revolver {{three or four times}} a day and marvel..." [...] Later that year, in Esquire, Robert Christgau called the album [...] "twice as good and four times as startling as Rubber Soul, with sound effects, Oriental drones, jazz bands, transcendentalist lyrics, all kinds of rhythmic and harmonic surprises, and a filter that made John Lennon sound like God singing through a foghorn".|$|E

Simon replied: [...] "You {{should recognize that}} some of those who are bitten by your sharp-toothed prose are likely, in their human weakness, to bite back ... may I be so bold as to <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> could well begin the cooling---a recovery of your sense of humor being a good first step." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the same}} time, British Foreign Secretary Earl Curzon {{wrote to the}} High Commissioner, Herbert Samuel, in August 1920, stating, [...] "I <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should {{let it be known}} {{forthwith}} that in the area south of the Sykes-Picot line, we will not admit French authority and that our policy for this area to be independent but in closest relations with Palestine." [...] Samuel replied to Curzon, [...] "After the fall of Damascus a fortnight ago...Sheiks and tribes east of Jordan utterly dissatisfied with Shareefian Government most unlikely would accept revival." [...] He subsequently announced that Transjordan was under British Mandate. Without authority from London, Samuel then visited Transjordan and at a meeting with 600 leaders in Salt, announced the independence of the area from Damascus and its absorption into the mandate, quadrupling the area under his control by tacit capitulation. Samuel assured his audience that Transjordan would not be merged with Palestine. The foreign secretary, Lord Curzon, repudiated Samuel's action.|$|E
2500|$|The {{guests at}} the hotel {{typically}} are comic foils to Basil's anger and outbursts. Guest characters in each episode provide different characteristics (working class, promiscuous, foreign) that he cannot stand. Requests both reasonable and impossible test his temper. Even the afflicted annoy him, as for example in the episode [...] "Communication Problems", revolving around the havoc caused by the frequent misunderstandings between the staff and the hard-of-hearing Mrs. Richards. By the end, Basil faints just {{at the mention of}} her name. This episode is typical of the show's careful weaving of humorous situations through comedy cross-talk. The show also uses mild black humour at times, notably when Basil is forced to hide a dead body and in Basil's comments about Sybil ("Did you ever see that film, How to Murder Your Wife? ... Awfully good. I saw it six times.") and to the guests ("May I <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> consider moving to a hotel closer to the sea? Or preferably in it.").|$|E
