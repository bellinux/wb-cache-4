At the algebraic level, symmetric amorphous <b>schemes</b> <b>were</b> {{classified by}} Ivanov (1985) [12] and commutative amorphous <b>schemes</b> <b>were</b> classified by Ito et al. (1991) [11]. A <b>scheme</b> <b>is</b> called skew-symmetric if the diagonal relation is the only symmetric relation. We show the non-existence of skew-symmetric amorphous schemes with at least four classes. We also prove that non-symmetric amorphous <b>schemes</b> <b>are</b> commutative...|$|R

A relation between computing monotone Boolean functions by using monotone span programs and realizing multi-access structures by using linear multisecret sharing <b>schemes</b> <b>is</b> shown.

The error performance and throughput efficiency of the <b>scheme</b> <b>are</b> analyzed. Two specific <b>schemes</b> <b>are</b> proposed for NASA near earth satellite communications. It is shown that both schemes provide high reliability and throughput efficiency even for high channel bit error rates in the range of. 002.

40|$|In this paper, {{we first}} show that three public-key (k, n) -traceability <b>schemes</b> can <b>be</b> derived from an [n, u, d]-linear code C such that d # 2 k + 1. The {{previous}} <b>schemes</b> <b>are</b> obtained as special cases. This observation gives a more freedom {{and a new}} insight to this field. For example, we show that BonehFranklin <b>scheme</b> <b>is</b> equivalent to a slight modification of the corrected KurosawaDesmedt scheme. This means that BF <b>scheme</b> <b>is</b> redundant or overdesigned because the modified KD <b>scheme</b> <b>is</b> much simpler.

5|$|While {{assigned}} to the nuclear delivery role, the Victor was finished in an all-over anti-flash white colour scheme, {{designed to protect the}} aircraft against the damaging effects of a nuclear detonation. The white colour <b>scheme</b> <b>was</b> intended to reflect heat away from the aircraft; paler variations of RAF's roundels were also applied for this same reason. When the V-bombers were {{assigned to}} the low-level approach profile in the 1960s, the Victors were soon repainted in green/grey tactical camouflage to reduce visibility to ground observation; the same <b>scheme</b> <b>was</b> applied to subsequently converted tanker aircraft.|$|E

By measuring the counting rate of the cosmic rays in different directions the detector would reveal the existence of any void in the overlaying rock structure.|$|E
