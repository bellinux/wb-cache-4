50|$|Valves {{are driven}} by roller-follower rocker arms with low {{friction}} roller bearings, and a unique, concave cam lobe design to increase valve lift over the traditional shimless lifter type system of the 1GR-FE. This increases overall cylinder head height to accommodate the slightly taller roller rocker system. Moreover, the cylinder head is segmented into 3 parts: valve cover, camshaft sub-assembly housing, and cylinder head sub-assembly.

50|$|In 1910 a {{somewhat}} heavier and larger locomotive was ordered from Hanomag. It weighed in at 12.2 tonnes (<b>service</b> <b>weight).</b> Because this engine acquitted itself well, in 1913 another one was ordered. These two locomotives were given numbers 4 and 5.

30|$|The FT-composition {{proposed}} by Townend et al. ([2005]) invokes variant services, and results are weighted {{based on a}} confidence metric for each <b>service.</b> The <b>weighting</b> algorithms, which are performed dynamically, take into account whether variant services are composed by common shared services and historic data of how often variant outputs agrees with the consensus. <b>Services</b> whose <b>weighting</b> is lower than a user-defined level are eliminated from the voting procedure for the remaining variants. Variant service endpoints are specified by the client. This means the solution {{is not able to}} dynamically bind new variants. Moreover, the functionalities of the proposed FT-compositions are exposed as web services operations. Therefore, we infer that this solution supports interoperable, QoS-aware, business-driven automated and autonomic compositions.|$|R

By this point, the smaller Wellington bomber had made its maiden flight three years earlier and quantity production of the type had started 18 months prior. When fully equipped, the calculated all-up <b>service</b> <b>weight</b> of the first prototype was 42,182lb, almost double that of the weight originally given by Vickers in its initial tender for the design.

Cartridges were made of raw silk, and stored in wooden crates in a special high-security section of the underground magazine. There were five types of shell on the Fort Rodd manifest in 1897: High Explosive (Lyddite), Armour-piercing, Common Pointed (for non-armoured maritime targets), and Shrapnel. The other class of projectile (and the one most often fired) was a solid steel shot (without any cavity for explosives or fuses, it was cheapest to produce). The shells and shot all had the same <b>service</b> <b>weight</b> of 94 pounds (to simplify calculation of elevation and depression) and diameter of 6 in; therefore, lengths of the various types varied.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the advent}} of the Prussian T 20 (DRG Class 95) in 1922 with its 1'E1' axle {{arrangement}} and better qualities than the initial Gt 2x4/4 series, a second series was built and deployed between 1922 (no. 5766) and 1923 (nos. 5767-5775). They were improved in comparison with their predecessors: greater evaporative heating area, capable of holding half a ton of coal more, greater axle load and <b>service</b> <b>weight,</b> short chimney (without a cap). Both series were later modified in different ways after being taken over by the Deutsche Reichsbahn, and incorporated into its classification scheme as Class 960. All locomotives were equipped with a Westinghouse compressed-air double brake, operating on all wheelsets from the front, the sand pipes initially served the second and fourth wheelsets of the front drive. After the modification of the second series in 1926, they were additionally fitted with a Riggenbach counter-pressure brake, and seven axles sanded to increase adhesion. To begin with the locos ran with three headlights at the front, but just two after 1926.|$|E
50|$|Depending on {{the water}} level of the Rhine, {{the height of the}} bridge varied at the {{crossing}} of the bank, which also changed the slope of the bridge: in low water, the bridge was lower than the shores, so that the trains on the bridge had a maximum incline of 3.5 % to climb; on the other hand, the bridge was higher than the shores at high water, so that a climb of a maximum of 3.3 % had to be overcome. The low load-bearing capacity of 101 t required the use of special, particularly light locomotives, Brückenlokomotiven (bridge locomotives) with a 22 t <b>service</b> <b>weight.</b> Trains with a maximum of five wagons were hauled over the bank and across the Rhine by a bridge locomotive and returned to a normal locomotive on the other bank. Since the bridge locomotives only had limited power, problems could arise at times of low water if the bridge locomotive was unable to pull the train off the bridge over the steep incline to the bank. During the operation of trains over the bridge, it was closed for road traffic for about two hours. There were five continuous pairs of trains each day in the 1925 timetable.|$|E
40|$|We {{present an}} {{analytical}} packet/floow-level modelling approach {{for the performance}} analysis of IEEE 802. 11 e WLAN, where we explicitly take into account QoS di␣erentiation mech- anisms based on minimum contention window size values and Arbitration InterFrame Space (AIFS) values, as included in the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) protocol of the 802. 11 e standard. We first enhance the packet-level approach previously used for best-effort WLANs to include traffic classes with different QoS requirements. The packet-level model approach yields <b>service</b> <b>weights</b> that discriminate among traffic classes. From these observations, the packet/flow-level model for 802. 11 e is the generalized discriminatory processor-sharing (GDPS) queueing model where the state-dependent system capacity is distributed among active traffic classes according to state-dependent priority weights. Extensive simulations show that the discriminatory processor-sharing model closely represents the flow behavior of 802. 11 e...|$|R
