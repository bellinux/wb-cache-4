40|$|Abstract. <b>Salinomycin</b> is a monocarboxylic {{polyether}} anti-biotic, {{which is}} widely used as an anticoccidial agent. The anticancer property of <b>salinomycin</b> has been recognized {{and is based on}} its ability to induce apoptosis in human multidrug resistance (MDR). The present study investigated whether <b>salinomycin</b> reverses MDR towards chemotherapeutic agents in doxorubicin-resistant MCF- 7 /MDR human breast cancer cells. The results demonstrated that doxorubicin-mediated cytotoxicity was significantly enhanced by <b>salinomycin</b> in the MCF- 7 /MDR cells, and this occurred in a dose-dependent manner. This finding was consistent with subsequent obser-vations made under a confocal microscope, in which the doxorubicin fluorescence signals of the salinomycin‑treated cells were higher compared with the cells treated with doxorubicin alone. In addition, flow cytometric analysis revealed that <b>salinomycin</b> significantly increased the net cellular uptake and decreased the efflux of doxorubicin. The expression levels of MDR- 1 and MRP- 1 were not altered at either the mRNA or protein levels in the cells treated with <b>salinomycin.</b> These results indicated that <b>salinomycin</b> was mediated by its ability to increase the uptake and decrease the efflux of doxorubicin in MCF‑ 7 /MDR cells. <b>Salinomycin</b> reversed the resistance of doxorubicin, suggesting that chemotherapy in combination with <b>salinomycin</b> may benefit MDR cancer therapy...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{molecular}} {{mechanism of}} Salinomycin's toxicity {{is not fully}} understood. Various studies reported that Ca 2 +, cytochrome c, and caspase activation {{play a role in}} Salinomycin-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, <b>Salinomycin</b> may target Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway to promote differentiation and thus elimination of cancer stem cells. In this study, we show a massive autophagic response to <b>Salinomycin</b> (substantially stronger than to commonly used autophagic inducer Rapamycin) in prostrate-, breast cancer cells, and to lesser degree in human normal dermal fibroblasts. Interestingly, autophagy induced by <b>Salinomycin</b> is a cell protective mechanism in all tested cancer cell lines. Furthermore, <b>Salinomycin</b> induces mitophagy, mitoptosis and increased mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψ) in a subpopulation of cells. <b>Salinomycin</b> strongly, and in time-dependent manner decreases cellular ATP level. Contrastingly, human normal dermal fibroblasts treated with <b>Salinomycin</b> show some initial decrease in mitochondrial mass, however they are largely resistant to Salinomycin-triggered ATP-depletion. Our data provide new insight into the molecular mechanism of preferential toxicity of <b>Salinomycin</b> towards cancer cells, and suggest possible clinical application of <b>Salinomycin</b> in combination with autophagy inhibitors (i. e. clinically-used Chloroquine).

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Salinomycin</b> is a {{polyether}} ionophore antibiotic {{that has}} recently been shown to induce cell death in human cancer cells displaying multiple mechanisms of drug resistance. The underlying mechanisms leading to cell death after <b>salinomycin</b> treatment have not been well characterized. We therefore investigated the role of <b>salinomycin</b> in caspase dependent and independent cell death in colon cancer (SW 480, SW 620, RKO) and breast cancer cell lines (MCF- 7, T 47 D, MDA-MB- 453). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We detected features of apoptosis in all cell lines tested, but the executor caspases 3 and 7 were only strongly activated in RKO and MDA-MB- 453 cells. MCF- 7 and SW 620 cells instead presented features of autophagy such as cytoplasmic vacuolization and LC 3 processing.

40|$|AbstractAcquiring therapy {{resistance}} {{is one of}} the major obstacles in the treatment of patients with cancer. The discovery of the cancer stem cell (CSC) –specific drug <b>salinomycin</b> raised hope for improved treatment options by targeting therapy-refractory CSCs and mesenchymal cancer cells. However, the occurrence of an acquired <b>salinomycin</b> resistance in tumor cells remains elusive. To study the formation of <b>salinomycin</b> resistance, mesenchymal breast cancer cells were sequentially treated with <b>salinomycin</b> in an in vitro cell culture assay, and the resulting differences in gene expression and <b>salinomycin</b> susceptibility were analyzed. We demonstrated that long-term <b>salinomycin</b> treatment of mesenchymal cancer cells resulted in salinomycin-resistant cells with elevated levels of epithelial markers, such as E-cadherin and miR- 200 c, a decreased migratory capability, and a higher susceptibility to the classic chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. The formation of <b>salinomycin</b> resistance through the acquisition of epithelial traits was further validated by inducing mesenchymal-epithelial transition through an overexpression of miR- 200 c. The transition from a mesenchymal to a more epithelial-like phenotype of salinomycin-treated tumor cells was moreover confirmed in vivo, using syngeneic and, for the first time, transgenic mouse tumor models.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of <b>salinomycin</b> on EOC cells.

The western blot assay showed that <b>salinomycin</b> could increase the expression of epithelial markers (E-cadherin and Keratin) while decrease the expression of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin and vimentin) in a dose-dependent manner. These results were ascertained by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

In addition, humans are highly sensitive to <b>salinomycin</b> and severe toxicity has been reported.

Here, we report efficient strategies for gram scale synthesis of the natural product SY- 1 (20 -deoxy <b>salinomycin),</b> and a saturated analogue, 18, 19 -dihydro SY- 1, for a comparative in vitro investigation of the biological profiles of these compounds with that of <b>salinomycin.</b> Across several assays, the deoxygenated structures required higher concentrations to elicit similar cellular responses to that of <b>salinomycin.</b> Similarly to <b>salinomycin,</b> SY- 1 or 18, 19 -dihydro SY- 1 treatment was found to reduce the proportion of CD 44 (+) /CD 24 (-) cells with essentially complete selectivity up to ∼IC 25. Importantly, the proportion of CD 44 (+) /CD 24 (-) cells showed a pronounced U-shaped dose response curve for <b>salinomycin</b> and its derivatives, but not for paclitaxel. The concentration for maximum response in this assay followed differences in IC 50 for <b>salinomycin</b> and its analogues, which {{emphasizes the importance of}} taking concentration dependence into account when comparing effects on the CD 44 (+) /CD 24 (-) phenotype. Small differences in the global conformation within the triad of compounds investigated together with differences in activity across assays emphasize the importance of substitution at C 20 for the activity of <b>salinomycin</b> and its derivatives...|$|E
40|$|<b>Salinomycin,</b> {{isolated}} from Streptomyces albus, displays antimicrobial activity. Recently, a large-scale screening approach identified <b>salinomycin</b> and nigericin as selective apoptosis inducers of cancer stem cells. Growing {{evidence suggests that}} <b>salinomycin</b> is able to kill different types of non-stem tumor cells that usually display resistance to common therapeutic approaches, but the mechanism of action of this molecule is still poorly understood. Since <b>salinomycin</b> has been suggested {{to act as a}} K(+) ionophore, we explored its impact on mitochondrial bioenergetic performance at an early time point following drug application. In contrast to the K(+) ionophore valinomycin, <b>salinomycin</b> induced a rapid hyperpolarization. In addition, mitochondrial matrix acidification and a significant decrease of respiration were observed in intact mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and in cancer stem cell-like HMLE cells within tens of minutes, while increased production of reactive oxygen species was not detected. By comparing the chemical structures and cellular effects of this drug with those of valinomycin (K(+) ionophore) and nigericin (K(+) /H(+) exchanger), we conclude that <b>salinomycin</b> mediates K(+) /H(+) exchange across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Compatible with its direct modulation of mitochondrial function, <b>salinomycin</b> was able to induce cell death also in Bax/Bak-less double-knockout MEF cells. Since at the concentration range used in most studies (around 10 μM) <b>salinomycin</b> exerts its effect at the level of mitochondria and alters bioenergetic performance, the specificity of its action on pathologic B cells {{isolated from}} patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) versus B cells from healthy subjects was investigated. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), proposed to mimic the tumor environment, attenuated the apoptotic effect of <b>salinomycin</b> on B-CLL cells. Apoptosis occurred to a significant extent in healthy B cells as well as in MSCs and human primary fibroblasts. The results indicate that <b>salinomycin,</b> when used above μM concentrations, exerts direct, mitochondrial effects, thus compromising cell survival...|$|E
