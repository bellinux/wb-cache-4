40|$|In order t o {{determine}} {{the effect of}} shrouding the ro tor blades of a particular turbine design on the over-all turbine performance, a con-servatively designed experinrental cold-air turbine was investigated bath with and wLthout a <b>shroud</b> <b>band</b> on the rotor blades. The t i p of the rotor blade was oriented tow & the tangential direction so that the adverse effect of blade-tip scraping would not be appreciable. It was found that the addition of a shroud t o the turbine-rotor blades had only a slight effect and did not inprove the turbine performance. The eff i-Y ciency f o r the unshrouded-rotor configuration was about one point higher than for the shrouded rotor...|$|E

5000|$|As {{they got}} closer, {{they found the}} ATDA {{to be in a}} slow rotation, with the conical nose shroud still attached, the two pieces hanging agape at the front like a giant, open jaw. Stafford {{described}} [...] "It looks like an angry alligator out here rotating around". He asked if maybe he could use the spacecraft to open the 'jaws' but the ground decided against it, fearing this might cause damage to the spacecraft.The crew described how the shroudâ€™s explosive bolts had fired but, because the quick disconnect lanyards that were designed to unlock the electrical connectors to the explosive bolts had not been hooked up, the electrical wiring to the bolts held the two 1-1/2 inch wide steel <b>shroud</b> retaining <b>bands</b> together. If the electrical wires were cut {{on one side of the}} shroud, the two steel bands would immediately straighten and, being still held together by the wires on the opposite side of the shroud, it was difficult to predict the path of the released bands. Their ability to rip open a space suit caused the salvage mission to be abandoned. At the Cape, backup pilot Buzz Aldrin suggested that Cernan cut the electric wires with surgical scissors from the equipment pack. An experiment on the ground demonstrated this could indeed slice the wires, but also showed the ATDA bristled with dangerous, sharp edges. Ground controllers were, in Deke Slayton's words, [...] "just aghast" [...] at the idea, which did not take into consideration the substantial risks of the energy in the released <b>shroud</b> retaining <b>bands</b> holding the <b>shroud</b> halves together, the constant spinning of the ATDA, or the fact that the released <b>shroud</b> retaining <b>bands,</b> might whip back, and puncture Cernan's spacesuit.|$|R
40|$|The {{rotating}} instability {{phenomenon is}} investigated experimentally on a laboratory low-speed axial fan. Unsteady pressure measurements are performed {{close to the}} rotor leading edge, in the far-field in the upstream-duct section, and within the rotating frame by using Kulite sensors near the blade tip. As reference, the occurrence of rotating instability is proven for a rotor configuration with large clearance size. Existing explanations assume that rotating instability is induced by the tip clearance vortex. Following these models, the characteristic spectral and modal signatures of rotating instability are generated by the circumferentially coupled unsteady vortex systems within the individual blade passages. However, some early findings on a shrouded rotor setup and a study on an annular cascade without clearance have {{raised questions about the}} validity of the existing theories. To answer these questions, a second configuration is investigated using the identical rotor in a shrouded version. Here, a <b>shrouding</b> <b>band</b> covers the blade tips over the whole circumference. By using a comprehensive sensor arrangement in a wide variation of operating conditions, the existence of spectral and modal rotating instability signatures is proven on the shrouded-rotor configuration, as well. In this case, the tip clearance vortex system and, respectively, the leakage flow are suppressed. The present study underlines that novel explanations are required to describe the physical mechanism that generates rotating instability...|$|R

5|$|Members of Howling Bells {{have cited}} The Beatles, Charles Mingus, Peter Green, Vinnie Colaiuta, and Jimi Hendrix as influences. The {{catalyst}} for the change from Waikiki to Howling Bells was Juanita and Joel's trip to see Black Rebel Motorcycle Club in Australia. They saw this <b>band</b> <b>shrouded</b> in red lights, and it created an atmosphere that inspired them to alter their musical direction. The band's style {{has been compared to}} that of Siouxsie and the Banshees, PJ Harvey, The Velvet Underground, Nick Cave, Mazzy Star, and The Duke Spirit. Their music has been called folk rock, melodic blues, and country-goth. Juanita disagrees with the group's gothic characterization.|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 69 - 80 The thrust herein is to {{encourage}} more people to take transient data during startups and rundowns. The common complaint is that it takes too much {{time and effort to}} prepare for this information. That argument is "weak" within today's instrumentation capabilities. Further, the more forms of information on the same transient data gives the person saddled with the responsibility of eliminating the problem a better confidence level in the final conclusion. The rotor system, whatever its configuration, forces all the system's responses during the run up and rundown. The ability to look at plots of time waveforms, orbits, polars, Bode plots, cascades, eccentricities, spectra, raw vs synchronous vs compensated information can be valuable. The ability to define accurately the "resonances" in the system and the corresponding ability to direct logical in-situ balancing. The ability to identify rubs when they occur. The initiation of "instabilities" is near breathtaking. The ability to correlate running speed vibration values vs subrotative (whirl or whip) values can be very meaningful and normally with unexpected results, i. e., qualifying the "damping" or "lack of' in a system. In all this, the FM tape recorder should never be overlooked; however, the digital storage capability with computer attached is extremely powerful and simple to manipulate. Speed tracking offers the ability of saving memory during operational delays, as the next speed threshold has not been reached. Three case histories are used to illustrate the advantages of transient measure. The three descend in "actual data" presented to simplify the process. The more complicated/involved issue is addressed first, and it is a 22 MW compressor turbine gas generator, power turbine, generator system. This equipment suffered from overfiring the combustors, over acceleration, and over heating the gas turbine system, rubs on compressor blades and heavy destructive rubs on hot turbine <b>shroud</b> <b>bands.</b> The unit whirls and whips. For about 18 hr after repairs, it suffered other problems of "surge/stall" due to IGV control problems (not covered in this text). The second case discusses a simple low horsepower, medium speed, five stage back pressure steam turbine with problems which existed for over one and one-half years. The basic trending, which showed varying amplitudes and phase, just simply did not define the problem. One set of transient startup/shutdown data on the soloed turbine brought to bear, "quickly," the main problem. Several options were open for correction; the simplest was performed, and the problem totally eliminated. Further, stress corrosion cracking failures were better understood under high stress. The third is a very complicated hot gas turbine single shaft, expander compressor steam turbine, unit. It goes through three (two rigid and one bending) criticals (=resonances) to reach an operating speed of - 18, 000 rpm. The failure of the first wreck is better investigated via transient data. The rebuilding and rebalancing involved is better understood. The comparison through a "resonant whirl" region that allowed correction is better understood. The original OEM went out of business in 1984...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the interim}} between {{the release of}} Counterparts and Test for Echo, Peart sought out long time jazz {{instructor}} Freddie Gruber, who agreed to help him reinvent his drumming style with formal jazz and swing training. During the tour for Test for Echo Peart began to extensively use traditional grip. The latter is a hallmarked technique of big band, swing, and jazz drumming, and was used by Peart in concert while playing many of the songs from Test for Echo. This style of playing has been used extensively on every subsequent tour. The tour {{in support of the}} album also marked the first time the band hit the road without an opening act. This enabled them {{to increase the number of}} songs available for setlist inclusion, as well as extend their time on stage to approximately three hours. Shows consisted of two sets running approximately 80 minutes each, bridged by a short 15 minute intermission. Promotion for each live show featured the tagline [...] "An Evening with Rush". This headlining and live format has remained unaltered to the present. To the welcomed surprise of long time fans, the tour also represented the first, and so far only, time that the song 2112 had been played live in its entirety. When all was said and done, the band's first tour as a solo act was an enormous success and members were optimistic and confident about where they were headed. Unfortunately, intense tragedy would strike Peart soon after and <b>shroud</b> the <b>band's</b> future in doubt and uncertainty.|$|R
