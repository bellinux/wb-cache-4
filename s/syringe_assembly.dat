30|$|Polymer {{solutions}} {{of varied}} compositions {{were subjected to}} electrospinning on a conventional set up. <b>Syringe</b> <b>assembly</b> was fit into syringe pump (Physics Equipment, Chennai, India) and a collector consisting of copper plate covered with aluminum foil was placed 10  cm downward from tip of the needle. A voltage of 20  kV between the two electrodes was maintained. These procedural parameters were adapted from previous report (Datta et al. 2012). Flow rate was varied between 0.25 and 10  µl min− 1. Various concentrations (starting from 9 : 1 parts to point beads free nanofibers were obtained with total polymer concentration of 8  % w/v) of polyvinyl alcohol: chitosan or substituted chitosan were studied. For cell culture studies, a 7 : 3 mixture of PVA: chitosan was used. Polyvinyl alcohol was obtained from Sigma Aldrich (99  % + hydrolyzed; average M w 130, 000 grade) and used as received.|$|E
40|$|Fluid Isolation in the {{medication}} vial: Air/ fluid isolation maneuvers {{were used to}} move {{the medication}} to the septum end of vial. This isolation may be achieved in multiple ways based {{on the experience of}} the astronaut with fluid management in microgravity. If vial adaptors/blunt cannula or <b>syringe</b> <b>assembly</b> is inserted into the to vial before fluid isolation commences, the stability of this assembly should be considered in an effort to limit the risk of "slinging off" of the vial during isolation. Alternatively, fluid isolation can be performed prior to attaching the syringe/vial adaptor assembly. Terrestrial practices for medication withdrawal from a nonvented vial require injection of an equivalent amount of air as the expected medication volume prior to withdrawing liquid. In microgravity, this action is still valid, however the injection of additional air into the vial creates a multitude of micro bubbles and increases the volume of medication mixed with air that then must be withdrawn to achieve the desired drug volume in syringe. This practice {{is more likely to be}} required when using vials > 30 ml in size and injection volumes > 10 mL. It is felt that based on the microgravity flight, the practice of air injection is more of a hindrance than help...|$|E
40|$|Infusion {{devices for}} {{continuous}} and precise drug administration are indispensable tools in anaesthesia and critical care medicine. Problems such as start-up delays, non-continuous flow and susceptibility to hydrostatic pressure changes at low infusion rates resulting in accidental bolus release or prolonged flow interruption are inherent to current infusion technology. In {{order to improve}} precise drug delivery, an innovative technical concept has been realised in a novel microvolumetric infusion pump (MVIP) device. The MVIP principle includes repeated filling and emptying of a non-compliant microsyringe {{without the use of}} valves. The performance of the MVIP prototype has been evaluated and compared with standard <b>syringe</b> infusion pump <b>assemblies.</b> The novel MVIP concept has thereby proven to eliminate most problems during infusion start-up, steady state flow and vertical pump displacement, and has the potential of revolutionising infusion technology and setting a new dimension in patient safety...|$|R
30|$|The {{kinematic}} viscosity of various polymeric surfactant solutions {{was measured using}} Tamson viscometer model TVB 44 at 90  °C. Interfacial tensions between different polymeric surfactant solutions and Angsi crude oil were measured with spinning drop method. Model SVT 20 spinning drop tensiometer equipped with video camera {{was used to determine}} the IFT at ambient temperature. For each sample, the fluids whose IFT was to be measured were introduced into a capillary tube. The tube was first filled with the denser fluid and then closed with teflon cap having a rubber septum. Then, a drop of the less dense fluid (oil) was injected into the tube through the rubber septum using a <b>syringe.</b> The tube-cap <b>assembly</b> was inserted into the tensiometer slot and screwed firmly in place. Appropriate rotation speed was then adjusted, so that the oil droplet can be suitably elongated. Lastly, the IFT between the two fluids were calculated using a built-in software system.|$|R
