40|$|A Thesis Submitted In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements For the Degree of Master of Science - BiologyPhenotypic {{plasticity}} is {{the ability}} of an organism to express different phenotypes in response to environmental changes. A given genotype may change their morphology, physiology, developmental timing, and/or behavior in response to changes in biotic factors (e. g. presence/absence of neighbors) and/or abiotic factors (e. g. temperature). For example, the annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana responds to seasonal temperature cues by altering its flowering schedule. When seeds are cold treated (cold stratification, germinating after winter) plants flower earlier than if not (germinating before winter). They may also flower earlier if shaded by a neighbor. Plants rarely experience only one environmental factor and their plastic ability depends on their genotype. To test the hypothesis that plasticity to seed stratification influences plant interactions, I planted 3 inbred genotypes of A. thaliana with different flowering time responses to cold stratification {{in the center of a}} 3 x 3 grid (1. 5 cm apart) with other plants (interaction) or with no surrounding plants (no interaction). To test if plants respond to differences in genotype of surrounding plants, they were planted in all possible inter- and intra-strain combinations. Replicates of interaction treatments were cold stratified or not and the center plant monitored for age at first flowering and number of fruits. To examine whole genome expression patterns in these environments, leaf tissues were harvested for hybridization to microarrays. We found that A. thaliana RILs are capable of recognizing neighbor genotypes but this ability was influenced by cold <b>stratification</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeds.</b> Additionally, A. thaliana RILs differentially expressed different genes in response to cold <b>stratification</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> and neighbor interaction...|$|R

40|$|Background {{and aims}} Lomatium dissectum (Apiaceae) is a perennial, {{herbaceous}} plant of wide distribution in Western North America. At {{the time of}} dispersal, L. dissectum seeds are dormant and have underdeveloped embryos. The aims of this work were to determine the requirements for dormancy break and germination, to characterize the type <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> dormancy, and {{to determine the effect}} of dehydration after embryo growth on seed viability and secondary dormancy. Methods The temperature requirements for embryo growth and germination were investigated under growth chamber and field conditions. The effect of GA 3 on embryo growth was also analyzed to determine the specific type <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> dormancy. We tested the effect <b>of</b> dehydration on <b>seed</b> viability and induction of secondary dormancy in seeds where embryos had elongated about four fold their initial length. Most experiments examining the nature <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> dormancy were conducted with seeds collected at one site in two different years. To characterize the degree of variation in dormancy breaking requirements among seed populations, we compared the <b>stratification</b> requirements <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> collected at eig different sites. Key results Embryo growth prior to and during germination occurred at temperatures between 3 and 6 °C and was negligible at <b>stratification</b> temperatures <b>of</b> 0. 5 and 9. 1 °C. Seeds buried in the field and exposed to natural winter conditions showed similar trends. Interruption <b>of</b> the cold <b>stratification</b> period by eight weeks <b>of</b> dehydration decreased <b>seed</b> viability by about 30 % and induced secondary dormancy in the remaining viable <b>seeds.</b> Comparison <b>of</b> the cold <b>stratification</b> requirements <b>of</b> different <b>seed</b> populations indicates that seeds collected from moist habitats have longer cold stratification requirements that those from semiarid environments. Conclusions <b>Seeds</b> <b>of</b> L. dissectum have deep complex morphophysiological dormancy.

While there are two central models for the genetic basis of phenotypic plasticity few studies have identified the genetic and molecular basis of plasticity. I used three recombinant inbred lines (RILs), of Arabidopsis thaliana generated by crossing two natural genotypes, and obtaining progeny after recombination, for a global gene expression study. Of the three RILs, one bolted (transition to reproductive tissue) later if the seeds experienced a coldstratification period relative to the seeds that did not experience this cold-treatment (sensitive-positive), one bolted earlier if the seeds experienced the cold-stratification relative to the non-cold treated seeds (sensitive-negative), and one did not change when it bolted regardless <b>of</b> the cold <b>stratification</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> (homeostatic). I found different sets of genes differentially expressed in the three RILs suggesting that the response to the same regime of cold-stratification is via different pathways. The homeostatic genotype increased transcription of protein metabolism genes in response to cold stratification; whereas the plastic genotypes differentially expressed genes involved in stress response. This cold-stratification which is a common dormancy breaking cue for these plants may also be perceived as a stress, as the plants differentially expressed stress genes. Thus both gene expression and perception of environment may be involved in plastic responses to environmental heterogeneity...|$|R

40|$|Seed {{germination}} {{in black}} cohosh was systematically examined in eighteen populations including 15 USDA accessions with an effective protocol for the consistent, season independent germination of this valuable alternative specialty crop. Two in vitro approaches were investigated {{for breaking the}} complex double dormancy <b>of</b> black cohosh <b>seeds</b> for year round germination of plants for increased cultivation and laboratory studies. The first approach was a two-step alternat ing temperature stratification in which surface sterilized seeds were incubated in darkness at 25 ?C for two weeks fol lowed by incubation at alternating temperatures of 20 ?C and 8 ?C for 12 -hour periods with a 16 -hour photoperiod for 12 months. The second was a three-step-approach that involved initial <b>stratification</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> in darkness at 25 ?C for two weeks, followed by incubation at 4 ?C in darkness for 3 - 4 months and then cultivation at 25 ?C with a 16 -hour photope riod to generate seedlings. Although both approaches broke double dormancy for black cohosh seed germination, the three-step-stratification technique yielded higher percentage seed germination in less time {{when compared to the}} two-step scheme, including for seeds stored over two years. Additional factors of critical importance for efficient ger mination included the selection of healthy and viable seeds, as well as thorough but non-excessive surface sterilization to control bacterial and fungal contamination. The in vitro approach for black cohosh germination allowed year-round cultivation and culture of a number of different genotypic accessions to enable laboratory based studies on cell culture and transformation approaches to aid in deciphering gene-metabolite relationships in this important medicinal plant. </p...|$|R

5000|$|The {{plant is}} {{difficult}} to reproduce from seed due to several factors. The fruit's pulp contains phenolic compounds which inhibit germination, and thus needs to be removed to promote germination. In addition, seeds have a morphological dormancy because the embryo is not fully developed when the fruit ripens; a period <b>of</b> warm <b>stratification</b> is required to complete maturation. Lastly, the seeds do not store well. Cleaned seeds can be sown outdoors after the fruit ripens in early fall, recognizing that germination will be slow the following spring. Rapid germination can be promoted by warm, moist <b>stratification</b> <b>of</b> cleaned <b>seed</b> under dark conditions for 8 weeks at 77 degrees F (25 degrees C) for optimum germination.

Cold <b>stratification</b> <b>of</b> white spruce <b>seed</b> to break dormancy has been specified as a requirement, but Heit (1961) and Hellum (1968) regarded stratification as unnecessary. Cone handling and storage conditions affect dormancy in that cold, humid storage (5 °C, 75% to 95% relative humidity) of the cones prior to extraction seemingly eliminated dormancy by overcoming the need to stratify. Periods of cold, damp weather {{during the period of}} cone storage might provide natural cold (stratification) treatment. Once dormancy was removed in cone storage, subsequent kiln-drying and seed storage did not reactivate dormancy.|$|R

There is considerable {{discussion about the}} genetic mechanisms for phenotypic plasticity. However, there is some agreement that changes in gene expression must be involved. In order to examine how natural selection has acted on phenotypic plasticity on the trait bolting time trait (transition to reproduction) and gene expression patterns in past populations, a set of Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs) of Arabidopsis thaliana were used. We tested the effect <b>of</b> cold-treating <b>seeds</b> (<b>stratification)</b> on bolting time in Arabidopsis thaliana. Cold <b>stratification</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> may be one environmental factor contributing to variation in spring versus fall germination in A. thaliana populations. Variation in both the direction and degree of plasticity was observed {{in a set of}} 120 RILs screened; genotypic selection analysis showed that past selection had favored bolting earlier in both environments. Three RILs that displayed extreme plasticities for bolting time in opposing directions across cold treatments were identified and global gene expression patterns were measured in a microarray experiment. A total of 294 genes were identified as being differentially expressed across cold treatments for the three extreme RILs (Fold change of > 2; p-value< 0. 05). In addition, Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) for bolting time were mapped in the complete set of RILs. Five QTL were mapped in the cold environment and three QTL were mapped in the no-cold environment explaining 40 % and 30 % of the observed phenotypic variation, respectively. QTL underlying variation in bolting time were screened for differentially expressed genes from the microarray study to identify candidate genes. Ninety-three of the identified genes colocalized to bolting time QTL, with kinesis and transferases being overrepresented in the expressed QTLs. Few studies have combined microarray and QTL data, and this study will offer insight into the genetic mechanism of phenotypic plasticity...|$|R

Germination <b>of</b> Ashe juniper <b>seed</b> were compared in a controlled environment at different levels of fruit maturation, lengths <b>of</b> storage, and <b>seed</b> <b>stratification</b> to determine potential germination. Annual mean germination varied by an order of magnitude (3. 1 % in 1993 vs. 0. 3 % in 1994), and the maximum occurred for seeds collected in November of each year (7. 05 % and 0. 49 %, respectively). After storing the seeds collected in 1993 and 1994 at room temperature for 24 and 6 months, respectively, mean germination significantly decreased to 0. 45 % and 0. 20 %, respectively. Cold <b>stratification</b> <b>of</b> stored <b>seeds</b> significantly increased mean germination to 15. 6 % and 13. 3 % in 1993 and 1994.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{in order to determine the}} appropriate treatment for breaking dormancy and the effect <b>of</b> salinity on <b>seed</b> germination <b>of</b> purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea cv. Magnus), in two separate experiments. In the first experiment, five levels of gibberellic acid (GA 3) (0, 250, 500, 1000, and 1500 mg×L− 1) with four levels <b>of</b> cold moist <b>stratification</b> period <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> at 5 °C (0, 5, 10 and 15 days) were launched. A factorial experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with four replications. The statistical analysis showed that concentration of 250 mg×L− 1 GA 3 with 10 days of cold moist chilling significantly increased the percentage of germination of normal seedlings and reduced the mean time of germination. In the second experiment, the seeds were chilled for 10 days at 5 °C and half of them treated with 250 mg×L− 1 GA 3 for 24 hours. The seeds treated with GA 3, and those non-treated were subjected to NaCl for salinity stress. The experiment was conducted using five salinity levels (0, 20, 40, 60 and 80 mM NaCl) in four replications in a completely randomized design. The results showed that purple coneflower is highly sensitive to salinity in the germination stage. The results also showed that by increasing salinity levels, the percentage of germination and normal seedlings significantly decreased and the mean time to germination increased, compared to the control treatment. But the seeds treated with GA 3 showed higher viability and better performance under salinity stress condition...|$|R
40|$|Literature was {{reviewed}} on the germination and possible uses for revegetation of the New Zealand indigenous species selected. <b>Seeds</b> <b>of</b> Carex trifida, Coprosma robusta, Cyperus ustulatus, Hebe stricta, Leptospermum scoparium, Muehlenbeckia australis, Myrsine australis, Phormium tenax, Phormium 'Yellow Wave' and Sophora prostrata were assessed for germination rates, percentage germination, dormancy {{and the effects}} that temperature has on germination. <b>Seeds</b> <b>of</b> Carex, Cyperus and Myrsine showed no germination in light or dark at 20 °C. In contrast, 12 weeks <b>of</b> low temperature <b>stratification</b> resulted in a high percentage <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> germinating for Carex and Cyperus. There was no germination of Myrsine despite high viability in the initial germination experiment and the <b>stratification</b> experiment. Removal <b>of</b> the endocarp and a period <b>of</b> <b>stratification</b> increased germination percentage of Myrsine to 91 %. Germination was low for Muehlenbeckia in the light at 20 °C, but 4 weeks <b>of</b> low temperature <b>stratification</b> increased germination rate. After 2 years, 80 % <b>of</b> Coprosma <b>seeds</b> germinated but germination rate increased after subjecting the seed to 8 weeks or more <b>of</b> <b>stratification.</b> No <b>seeds</b> <b>of</b> Coprosma or Muehlenbeckia germinated in the dark. Rapid germination <b>of</b> Hebe <b>seeds</b> was obtained, with 100 % <b>of</b> the <b>seed</b> germinating in the light while only 7 % germinated in the dark. Leptospermum had rapid germination, with 100 % germinating in the light, while only 3 % germinated in the dark. A low percentage <b>of</b> Phormium <b>seed</b> germinated in both the light and dark {{in the first month}} and no further germination was observed. In contrast, 8 weeks or more <b>of</b> low temperature <b>stratification</b> resulted in almost complete germination. There was rapid germination <b>of</b> Sophora <b>seeds</b> with 100 % <b>of</b> the <b>seed</b> germinating in the light and dark. Carex seed had a limited temperature range at which it germinated (22 °C to 26 °C), while Cyperus had a wider range (18 °C to 32 °C) but did not germinate at low temperatures (6 °C to 14 °C). The optimum germination range for Cyperus was 24 °C to 30 °C. Hebe did not germinate at high temperatures (30 °C to 32 °C) but successfully germinated at all other temperatures with the optimum germination range being 6 °C to 24 °C. Leptospermum did not germinate at 6 °C but had maximum germination at most other temperatures. Muehlenbeckia and Phormium germinated at all temperatures tested (6 °C to 32 °C) with the most seed germinating at 20 °C for Muehlenbeckia and between 14 °C to 22 °C for Phormium. Sophora did not germinate at the low temperatures (6 °C to 10 °C). The germination rate increased with temperature for Cyperus, Hebe, Leptospermum, Muehlenbeckia, and Phormium. Generally, for Carex and Sophora as temperature increased germination rate slowed. It appeared that light is required for Hebe and Leptospermum to germinate. Sophora required scarification but not light. Coprosma and Muehlenbeckia required light and a period of chilling to increase the rate of germination. A small percentage of the Phormium population is not dormant but a period of chilling increased the germination percentage for that portion of the population that is dormant. Carex and Cyperus required a period of chilling in order to break dormancy. Myrsine required removal of endocarp and a period of chilling to germinate. A list of cleaning descriptions and the equipment that was used for each species studied is reported. Preliminary results of a hydroseeding trail using the species studied were also reported...|$|R

So in this study the objective was to identify the most efficient vigor tests on <b>stratification</b> <b>of</b> lots <b>of</b> corn <b>seeds</b> cv. 'Sertanejo'. The experiment was conducted at Laboratory <b>of</b> <b>Seed</b> Analysis at the Center of agricultural Science of the Universidade Federal da Paraíba, using samples from 20 seed lots in a completely randomized design. For characterization of the lots it was evaluated water content, germination and vigor (cold test, electrical conductivity, accelerated aging, seedling emergence in field and germination at low temperatures). The accelerated aging, electrical conductivity and field emergence of seedlings tests are the most efficient for classification of lots <b>of</b> corn <b>seeds</b> cv.

40|$|Sugars have {{pronounced}} {{effects on}} many plant processes like gene expression, germination and early seedling development. Several screens for sugar insensitive mutants {{were performed to}} identify genes involved in sugar response pathways using the model plant Arabidopsis. These include sun, gin and sis screens explained earlier in this chapter. Both common mutants and dissimilar mutants were identified in the different screens. Interestingly, ABA and ABI 4 seem to play an essential function in all these sugar response assays. To gain further insight in sugar signalling we studied sugar response pathways encompassing germination and early seedling establishment. We focussed our research on the sugar-regulated expression of PC in dark-grown seedlings, the glucose-induced delay of germination and the sugar-induced early seedling developmental block (gin and sis response). In Chapter 2 (and partly this Chapter) we describe that sugars delay Arabidopsis seed germination. Already low concentrations of glucose are able to delay seed germination and this delay is independent from osmotic signalling. Analysing mutants with a gin phenotype like ctr 1, abi 4 and abi 5 shows that these mutants respond like wt to glucose with respect of the delay of germination. This indicates that the delay of germination and the gin response are two different processes. Since additional studies that show that <b>stratification</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeds</b> on sugar-free media suppresses the glucose-induced delay of germination but not the glucose-induced early seedling development arrest supports this conclusion. In Chapter 3 we propose a function for ABI 3 (and ABI 2) in sugar responses as well. We found that ABI 3, ABI 4 and ABI 5 levels rise in seedlings that are challenged with glucose. abi 3 mutants are insensitive {{for a range of}} sugar assays and abi 3 mutants show a severely reduced induction of ABI 4 and ABI 5 after sugar treatment. These results suggests that ABA and sugar signalling (gin pathway) are more alike than assumed before. It has been hypothesized that elevated sugar concentrations induce ABA signalling by increasing ABA levels. Despite the large overlap in signalling components, analysis of a glucose and ABA insensitive mutant over expressing ABI 4 (abi 5 - 1 / 35 S::ABI 4) revealed that glucose and ABA are two distinct signals. In Chapter 4 we investigated to sun response pathway in more detail. Thus far, only one sun mutant, sun 6 /abi 4, has been identified. We tested other sugar and ABA signalling mutants for their sun response. The other way around, sun mutants were tested for their gin response as well. Remarkably, ABA deficient mutants, which are strong gin mutants, do not show a significant sun phenotype. Thus, ABA is important for the gin response pathway but not in the sun pathway that regulates PC levels in response to sucrose. In Chapter 5 the results of the preceding chapters are summarized and discussed. The similarities and differences between the sugar response pathways studied are presented...|$|R
40|$|Echinochloaoryzicola(syn. E. phyllopogon) is {{an exotic}} weed of California rice paddies that has evolved {{resistance}} to multiple herbicides. Elimination of seedlingsthroughcertain weed control methods can limit {{the spread of}} this weed, but is contingent on accurate predictions of germination and emergence timing, which are influenced by seed dormancy levels. In summer annuals, dormancy can often be relieved through <b>stratification,</b> a period <b>of</b> prolonged exposure to cold and moist conditions. We used population-based threshold models to quantify the effects <b>of</b> <b>stratification</b> on <b>seed</b> germination <b>of</b> four E. Oryzicola populations at a range of water potential (Y) and oxygen levels. We also determined how stratification temperatures, moisture levels and durations contributed to dormancy release. Stratification released dormancy by decreasing base Y and hydrotimerequired for germination and by eliminating any germination sensitivity to oxygen. Stratification also increased average germination rates (GR), which were used {{as a proxy for}} relative dormancy levels. Alternating temperatures nearly doubled GR in all populations, indicating that seeds could be partially dormant despite achieving high final germination percentages. Stratification at Y = 0 MPa increased GR compared to stratification at lower water potentials, demonstrating that Y contributed to regulating dormancy release. Maximum GR occurred after 2 - 4 weeks <b>of</b> <b>stratification</b> at 0 MPa; GR were often more rapid for herbicide-resistant than for herbicide-susceptible seeds, implying greater dormancy in the latter.

40|$|The Author(s) 2014. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Thellungiella halophila (salt cress) is a salt tolerant species with high genetic and morphological sim-ilarity to model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The role of growth regulators in imposing seed dormancy and a release from it while responding to environmental signals has been examined. <b>Seeds</b> <b>of</b> salt cress possess a deep dormancy at maturity which decreased during after-ripening and cold <b>stratification.</b> After-ripened <b>seeds</b> <b>of</b> salt cress failed to germinate in dark and in strong light (134 lmol m- 2 s- 1) while best seed germination was obtained in weak white light (1 – 10 lmol m- 2 s- 1) at 22 C. The germination of non-dormant salt cress seeds was also regulated by red and far-red light. Light enhanced the sensitivity to gibberellin in dark-imbibed salt cress seeds and strong light inhibited biosynthesis of gibberellins. The endogenous abscisic acid was {{not affected by}} strong light implying that inhibition <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> germination is not mediated through ABA signals. Higher seed germination was recorded at a constant temperature of 20 C and a thermoperiod of 15 / 25 C (12 h strong light/ 12 h dark). <b>Seeds</b> <b>of</b> salt cress when exposed to 400 mM NaCl for 10 days maintain their via-bility however there was a heavy mortality among Arbid-opsis seeds under similar conditions. Our data indicates that seed germination in salt cress is highly regulated by environmental and hormonal signals to provide opportu-nities to germinate under natural conditions...|$|R
