50|$|Sesamum is a genus of {{approximately}} 20 {{species in the}} flowering plant family Pedaliaceae. The plants are annual or perennial herbs with edible seeds. The best-known member of the genus is sesame, <b>Sesamum</b> <b>indicum</b> (<b>syn.</b> Sesamum orientale), the source of sesame seeds. The species are primarily African, with some species occurring in India, Sri Lanka, and China. The origin of S. indicum is uncertain as it is widely cultivated and naturalized in tropical regions. The genus {{is closely related to}} the strictly African genus Ceratotheca and is itself probably African in origin.|$|E

The micrographs showed that candle tree phospholipids formed planar bilayer and cluster of vesicles with lipid droplets, while coconut and sesame phospholipids formed well-defined unilamellar vesicles. The vesicles size could be as small as 50 nm in diameter. Coconut phospholipids also showed a good bending ability. Formation of clusters of vesicles was also found in coconut phospholipids dispersion, but this cluster was easily broken by extrusion through a small pore membrane...|$|R
40|$|Sesame (<b>Sesamum</b> <b>indicum</b> L. <b>syn.</b> <b>Sesamum</b> orientale L.) is {{an orphan}} crop species with most {{molecular}} genetic research {{work done in}} the last decade. In this study, we used a pyrosequencing approach for the development of genomic simple-sequence repeat (SSR) markers in sesame. Our approach proved successful in identifying 19, 816 nonredundant SSRs, 5727 of which were identified in a contig assembly that covers 19. 29 % of the sesame genome. Mononucleotide repeats were the most abundant SSR type identified in the sesame genome (48. 5 % of all SSRs), followed by dinucleotide SSRs (45. 0 %). Adenine–thymine-rich motifs were predominant, representing 81. 7, 51. 7, 66. 5, and 22. 1 % of the mononucleotide, dinucleotide, trinucleotide, and tetranucleotide SSRs, respectively. As a result of this work, we introduce 933 experimentally validated sesame specific markers, 849 of which are also applicable in Sesamum mulayanum (syn. Sesamum orientale var. malabaricum Nar.), the wild progenitor of cultivated sesame. Using a subset of the newly identified SSR markers, we analyzed molecular genetic diversity and population structure of a collection of world accessions. Results of the two analyses almost overlapped and suggested correlation between genetic similarity and geographical proximity. Indeed, a pattern of gene flow among sesame diversity centers was apparent, with levels of variability in some regions similar to that seen in the domestication origin of the crop. Taken together with the high rate of genomic marker transferability detected between S. indicum and S. mulayanum, our results represent additional molecular genetic evidence for designating the two taxa as cultivated and wild forms of the same species.

40|$|Sesame (<b>Sesamum</b> <b>indicum</b> L. <b>syn.</b> <b>Sesamum</b> orientale L.) is {{considered}} to be the first oil seed crop known to man. Despite its versatile use as an oil seed and a leafy vegetable, sesame is a neglected crop and has not been a subject of molecular genetic research until the last decade. There is thus limited knowledge regarding genome-specific molecular markers that are indispensible for germplasm enhancement, gene identification, and marker-assisted breeding in sesame. In this study, we employed a genotyping by sequencing (GBS) approach to a sesame recombinant inbred line (RIL) population for high-throughput single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) identification and genotyping. A total of 15, 521 SNPs were identified with 14, 786 SNPs (95. 26 %) located along sesame genome assembly pseudomolecules. By incorporating sesame-specific simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers developed in our previous work, 230. 73 megabases (99 %) of sequence from the genome assembly were saturated with markers. This large number of markers will be available for sesame geneticists as a resource for candidate polymorphisms located along the physical chromosomes of sesame. Defining SNP loci in genome assembly sequences provides the flexibility to utilize any genotyping strategy to survey any sesame population. SNPs selected through a high stringency filtering protocol (770 SNPs) for improved map accuracy were used in conjunction with SSR markers (50 SSRs) in linkage analysis, resulting in 13 linkage groups that encompass a total genetic distance of 914 cM with 432 markers (420 SNPs, 12 SSRs). The genetic linkage map constitutes the basis for future work that will involve quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses of metabolic and agronomic traits in the segregating RIL population.

A total of 150 Swiss mice, divided into 25 groups were employed in this study. <b>Sesamum</b> <b>indicum</b> (4 %, 8 % and 16 % w/w) was admixed in diet of mice for a period of 14 days.

40|$|Abstract: The {{relative}} abundance of some Nigerian seed oils {{coupled with the}} little knowledge of their biodiesel usage prompted the need for this research. Biodiesel production is a very modern and technological area for researchers due to the relevance that it is winning everyday because {{of the increase in}} the petroleum price and the environmental advantages. In this work, studies were carried out to investigate the fuel properties of Cyperus esculentus, Colocynthus vulgaris, <b>Sesamum</b> <b>indicum</b> ethylesters and their corresponding ethyl ester blends. Ethylesters of these oils were prepared by H 2 SO 4 catalysed transesterification reaction between the oils and ethanol. The fuel properties such as kinematic viscosity, flash points, pour point and water crackle were determined. GC-MS was used to determine the fatty acid profile of the transesterified oils. The fuel properties correlated very well with the fatty acid compositions. The results showed that the oils were rich in saturated fatty acids (66. 67 %), appreciable value of monounsaturated fatty acids (33. 33 %) and little percent (33. 33 %) polyunsaturated fatty acids and absence of polyunsaturated fatty acids in Cyperus esculentus and <b>Sesamum</b> <b>indicum</b> esters.

40|$|Abstract: For {{the past}} several years, several {{techniques}} of physiology have been applied to overcome the water deficit and drought stress in field crops. However little information is gained on the response to PBZ and ABA treatments under drought stress and their ameliorative actions on Sesamum. So a study was carried out to understand the effect of PBZ and ABA on drought stress amelioration in <b>Sesamum</b> <b>indicum</b> L. The main aspects studied were the non-enzymatic antioxidant changes {{in different parts of}} treated, drought stressed as well as control plants. The non-enzymatic antioxidants (ascorbic acid and tocopherol) were extracted and estimated. The non-enzymatic antioxidant molecules like ascorbate and-tocopherol showed significant increase under drought condition in <b>Sesamum</b> <b>indicum.</b> PBZ caused significant enhancement in these antioxidant enzymes under drought stress and also in well-watered conditions. It is not so with ABA treatment. ABA slightly reduced the non-enzymatic antioxidant contents.
