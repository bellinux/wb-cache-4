A nine-nation study within the European Union found that current or ex-partners were the perpetrators of around 25% of all sexual assaults, and that violence was more common in assaults by ex-partners (50% of the time) and partners (40%) than in assaults by strangers or recent acquaintances (25%).|$|E

5000|$|Sometimes, if a {{young adult}} male has a <b>spouse</b> or <b>partner,</b> they will perform or assist in the exam, which then may be done also {{as a form of}} sex play and/or foreplay.

Many forms of elder abuse are recognized as types of domestic violence or family violence since they are committed by family members. Paid caregivers have also been known to prey on their elderly patients.|$|E
5000|$|The core {{element to}} the harm of elder abuse is the [...] "expectation of trust" [...] {{of the older}} person toward their abuser. Thus, it {{includes}} harms by people the older person knows or with whom they have a relationship, such as a <b>spouse,</b> <b>partner</b> or family member, a friend or neighbor, or people that the older person relies on for services. Many forms of elder abuse are recognized as types of domestic violence or family violence.|$|E
50|$|An abuser {{can be a}} <b>spouse,</b> <b>partner,</b> relative, {{a friend}} or neighbor, a {{volunteer}} worker, a paid worker, practitioner, solicitor, or any other individual {{with the intent to}} deprive a vulnerable person of their resources. Relatives include adult children and their spouses or partners, their offspring and other extended family members. Children and living relatives who have a history of substance abuse or have had other life troubles are of particular concern. For example, HFE abusive individuals {{are more likely to be}} a relative, chronically unemployed, and dependent on the elderly person.|$|E

40|$|In the National Survey of Families and Households a {{face-to-face}} interview {{was conducted with}} a randomly selected adult member of each sample household. In addition, if this primary respondent was currently married or cohabiting (with an opposite sex lover/partner) the <b>spouse</b> or <b>partner</b> was {{asked to complete a}} questionnaire covering a variety of aspects of family life. The questionnaire took about 30 minutes to complete. The <b>spouse</b> or <b>partner</b> {{is referred to as the}} "secondary respondent. " (See Sweet, Bumpass, and Call (1988) for a detailed description of survey procedures and content.) The major purposes of the secondary respondent questionnaire were: 1. to obtain current and retrospective characteristics of the <b>spouse</b> or <b>partner</b> directly from him or her, rather than by means of proxy reports from the primary respondent; 2. to obtain information on the relationship between the partners and parenting information from each partner; and 3. to obtain measures of various attitudes and opinions from the <b>spouse</b> or <b>partner.</b> At the beginning of the interview the interviewer told the primary respondent that there was a questionnaire for the <b>spouse</b> or <b>partner</b> to fill out.

50|$|Financial {{infidelity}} is the secretive act {{of spending}} money, possessing credit and credit cards, holding secret accounts or stashes of money, borrowing money, or otherwise incurring debt unknown {{or unwilling to}} one's <b>spouse,</b> <b>partner,</b> or significant other. Financial infidelity in a relationship may also include any financial decision(s) made by a partner that may effect, burden, strain or set back the financial planning of the relationship. Adding to the monetary strain commonly associated with financial infidelity in a relationship is a subsequent loss of intimacy and trust in the relationship. Financial infidelity {{appears to be on}} the rise, with a 2005 study showing that 30% of respondents had lied about financial information and 25% had withheld information, whereas a 2008 study showed that half the respondents had committed some form of financial infidelity.|$|E
50|$|States {{impose a}} range of incapacities until the {{children}} reach an age when they are deemed sufficiently mature {{to take responsibility for}} their own actions. Issues of access and custody interact and overlap, and represent all of the aspects of care and control that parents may exercise in relation to their children. The extent to which the courts have jurisdiction to regulate access will depend on the nature of the parents' relationship. In the event of a marriage, the courts may adjust access rights as an aspect of proceedings for legal separation, annulment or divorce. In the event of other relationships, jurisdiction may be invoked by either <b>spouse,</b> <b>partner,</b> natural parent (which may sometimes include fathers from unlawful sexual relationships), adoptive parent, legal guardian or by a guardian ad litem appointed to represent any child's interests.|$|E

40|$|Buss postulates {{that the}} human mind has {{developed}} adaptations for killing (killing or homicide modules), that murder is qualitatively different from all other forms of violence, and that homicidal ideation (fantasies) almost invariably precedes carried-out kills, and he claims that Daly & Wilson's slip-up argument fails because premeditated mate (<b>spouse,</b> <b>partner)</b> killing cannot result from the mere slip-ups central to the by-product (of ever more desperate strategies of mate guarding) hypothesis. In this review a number of alternative interpretations are presented: Normal distribution and coincidental status striving theory, special taxon of substrate dysfunctions, phylogenetic regression theory, and overcontrol theory. Finally, the problematic mate-killing module (as allegedly "superior" to the by-product theory) and the obscure role of homicidal ideation are critically assessed...|$|E

40|$|Abuse {{in later}} life (ALL) is the willful abuse, neglect, or {{financial}} exploitation of an older adult that is perpetrated by someone in an ongoing relationship (e. g., <b>spouse,</b> <b>partner,</b> family member, or caregiver) with the victim. As such, the term abuse {{in later life}}—used by the Office on Violence Against Women, the National Clearinghouse on Abuse in Later Life, {{and a number of}} domestic violence and sexual assault programs throughout the country— calls attention to the nexus between domestic violence, sexual assault, and elder abuse. Other terms are also used to define abuse of older adults. Elder abuse is a broad term that applies to abuse, neglect, and exploitation of an older individual in a trusting relationship with the offender. Elder abuse also includes harm that occurs because an older person is targeted based on age or disability (U. S. DOJ, 2013), such as in contractor scams. In many jurisdictions, elder abuse may also include self-neglect. Abuse of vulnerable, dependent, or at-risk adults generally refers to harm of persons 18 or older who are unable to protect themselves or report the abuse. © Eric Montfort/Flickr Abuse in later life is the segment of elder abuse that focuses specifically on those cases where the abuse is perpetrated by someone in an ongoing relationship (e. g., <b>spouse,</b> <b>partner,</b> family member, or caregiver) with the victim. Sexual abuse and stalking by an offender who is known to the victim or a stranger is also included in the definition. Older persons who fit the statutory definition in their jurisdiction of vulnerable adults and are in a relationship with their abuser may also be victims of abuse in later life. Power and control dynamics, similar to those seen in domestic violence and sexual assault cases involving younger victims, are often present in abuse in later life situations. Older victims may benefit from services provided by domestic and sexual violence programs...|$|E
40|$|Objective: As psychiatrists or psychotherapists, {{many of us}} {{may have}} had contact with people by e-mail and/or through online ‘chat rooms’. These people may write to us about their various problems, {{especially}} in their interpersonal relationships; discuss their queries about conflicts with their <b>spouse,</b> <b>partner,</b> and friends; or complained of low self-esteem and problems at work. In this article, {{we will try to}} discuss certain considerations and opinions about the possibility of insight-oriented psychotherapy in the domain of ‘virtual reality'. Method: This study was based on clinical observation of the first author. Two cases of ‘Cyberanalysis’ were described. The management of transference and countertransference, the analysis of defenses in this context, and possible reasons for success and failure of each case were discussed. Results: We have witnessed the formation of a transferential relationship between the ‘client’ and the therapists after a matter of months. One of the client had a satisfactory outcome and the other represented a therapeutic failure. Conclusion: This type of psychotherapy may provide a novel opportunity for therapists to move toward the internal world of the patient Compared to ‘real world’ therapies. This modality of therapy also has its own advantages and shortcomings...|$|E
40|$|Definition: Informal {{caregivers}} are unpaid individuals (often a <b>spouse,</b> <b>partner,</b> family member, {{friend or}} neighbor) involved in supporting others in {{activities of daily}} living. - Caregiver burden is an emerging public health issue largely attributed to longer life expectancy that not only increases the number of elderly individuals, but also the level of dependency in these individuals. - Despite many formal support services, informal support {{continues to be the}} primary source of care for the elderly, dependent and disabled. - Unpaid family caregivers will likely continue to be the primary source of long-term care in the United States as the aging population will more than double between the years 2000 and 2030 from 35. 1 million to 71. 5 million. - In 2009, three in ten U. S. households reported at least one person providing unpaid care as a family caregiver. - Caregivers report performing housekeeping and personal tasks, running errands, managing medical needs and more. - Caregivers spend on average 20. 4 hours per week providing care. Those who live with their care recipient spend 39. 3 hours per week caring for that person. [URL]...|$|E
