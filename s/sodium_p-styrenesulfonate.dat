40|$|The {{sulfonic}} acid-functionalized mesoporous organic-inorganic hybrid {{materials were}} synthesized via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) method. SBA- 15 material was first grafted with 4 -(chloromethyl) phenyltrimethoxysilane. The surface-initiated polymerization of <b>sodium</b> <b>p-styrenesulfonate</b> inside the pore wall of functionalized SBA- 15 results in p-styrenesulfonic acid functionalized SBA- 15 (PSS-SBA- 15). The results of FT-IR, nitrogen sorption isotherm, XRD, TEM and thermal gravimetric analyses (TGA) {{confirm that the}} PSS-SBA- 15 materials have ordered mesoporous structure, open channels and styrenesulfonic acid functionalities. The catalytic activity of PSS-SBA- 15 was higher than commercial Nafion resin in the esterification of lauric acid with ethanol. The unique catalytic performance of PSS-SBA- 15 is probably attributed to the increased accessibility of the active sites to the reactants because {{of the existence of}} styrenesulfonic acid on the pore surface of SBA- 15.

40|$|Our {{recent study}} has {{revealed}} that neutral polyampholytes form tough physical hydrogels above a critical concentration Cm,c by forming ionic bonds of wide strength distribution. In this work, we systematically investigate {{the behavior of a}} polyampholyte system, poly(NaSS-co-DMAEA-Q), randomly copolymerized from oppositely charged monomers, <b>sodium</b> <b>p-styrenesulfonate</b> (NaSS) and acryloyloxethyltrimethylammonium chloride (DMAEA-Q) without and with a slight chemical cross-linking. A phase diagram of formulation has been constructed in the space of monomer concentration Cm and cross-linker density CMBAA. Three phases are observed for the as-synthesized samples: homogeneous solution at dilute Cm, phase separation at semi-dilute Cm, and homogenous gel at concentrated Cm. Above a critical Cm,c, the polyampholyte forms a supramolecular hydrogel with high toughness by dialysis of the mobile counter-ions, which substantially stabilizes both the intra- and inter chain ionic bonds. The presence of the chemical cross-linker (CMBAA > 0) brings about a shift of the tough gel phase to lower Cm,c. The tough polyampholyte gel, containing [similar] 50 wt% water, is highly stretchable and tough, exhibits fracture stress of σb [similar] 0. 4 MPa, fracture strain of εb [similar] 30, and the work of extension at fracture Wext [similar] 4 MJ m− 3. These values are at the level of most tough soft materials. Owing to the reversible ion bonds, the poly(NaSS-co-DMAEA-Q) gels also exhibit complete self-recovery (100 %) and high fatigue resistance upon repeated large deformation...|$|E
40|$|Recently, we have {{reported}} that polyampholytes, synthesized from free radical copolymerization of anionic monomer and cationic monomer, form physical hydrogels of high toughness and self-healing. The random distribution of the opposite charges forms ionic bonds of a wide distribution of strength. The strong bonds serve as permanent cross-links, imparting elasticity, whereas the weak bonds serves as reversible sacrificial bonds by breaking and reforming to dissipate energy. In this work, {{we focus on the}} rupture behaviors of the polyampholyte physical hydrogel, P(NaSS-co-MPTC), copolymerized from <b>sodium</b> <b>p-styrenesulfonate</b> (NaSS) and 3 -(methacryloylamino) propyltrimethylammonium chloride (MPTC). Tensile test and pure shear test were performed at various stretch rates in the viscoelastic responses region of the material. Tensile test showed yielding, strain softening, and strain hardening, revealing the dually cross-linked feature of the gel. Pure shear test showed crack blunting at the notched tip and a large yielding zone with butterfly shaped birefringence pattern ahead of the crack tip. After blunting, crack advanced at steady-state velocity with a constant angle. The conditions for the occurrence of crack blunting and variables governing the crack advancing angle are discussed. We found that even for these highly stretchable samples, significant blunting only occurs when the tensile fracture stress σf is larger than modulus E by a factor of about 2, in consistent with Hui’s theoretical prediction for elastic materials. The crack advancing angle θ was found to be proportional to σy/E over a wide stretch rate range, where σy is the yielding stress. In addition, the fracture energy was correlated to small strain modulus by a power law in the viscoelastic response region. This systematic study will merit revealing the fracture mechanism of tough viscoelastic materials including biological tissues and recently developed tough and highly stretchable hydrogels...|$|E
