25|$|By 1930, the BSA Group's primary {{activities}} were BSA motorcycles and Daimler vehicles. However, all the quality car businesses experienced financial {{difficulties in the}} late 1920s. Daimler's situation seemed particularly serious. Sales fell sharply in 1927–1928, a period of losses ensued and no dividends were paid between 1929 and 1936. The <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engine</b> was outdated, Daimler's production methods had become old-fashioned, they had an extravagantly large range of products. Their bankers noted the decreasing sales volume, the poor performance for price {{and the need for}} up-to-date machine tool equipment. Stratton-Instone's dominance of distribution was removed and other outlets arranged. The interests in Singer and the Daimler Hire business were sold and Lanchester bought. The in-house bodywork department was closed and by the spring of 1931 car production ceased, only commercial vehicle production and aero engine work kept Daimler in business.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{his many}} other works, he {{improved}} the engines {{that were used}} in the first tanks, oversaw the research into the physics of internal combustion that led to the use of octane ratings, was instrumental in development of the <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engine</b> design, and invented the Diesel [...] "Comet" [...] Swirl chamber that made high-speed diesel engines economically feasible.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1912 the Daimler CC bus arrived. Features {{of the bus}} {{included}} a Knight <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engine</b> rated at 40 h.p. a silent chain type gearing system and a worm type gear box. This was the same vehicle that the London County Council has just ordered 400 units of for extending their services around London.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1920s, a 1997 cc sports {{model was}} marketed {{and in some}} models <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engines</b> were used.|$|R
50|$|In 1921, Walter Bergius {{designed}} his <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> {{range of}} <b>engines.</b> Though the engines performed well and were very quiet, {{a feature of}} <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engines,</b> {{due to the lack}} of noisy valves and tappets, the engines were prone to excessive wear. The last sleeve-valve Kelvin engine was made in 1946.|$|R
50|$|The company {{produced}} {{a number of}} models which were sold widely in Europe and in the USA. In 1905 these ranged from 2.3 litres to the 8.1 litre 40/52 HP and by 1914 Minerva-built Knight <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engines</b> replaced side-valve units in the larger cars. Post-1918 only <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engines</b> were used. Citroën's chevron gears {{were used for the}} bevel drive rear axles from 1914 and a unique feature was the Mors patented clutch, which had a contracting band system which replaced the cone clutch used until 1903.|$|R
50|$|For the 1928 {{model year}} the {{manufacturer}} {{followed up with}} the “Sizaire Frères Six”, which was fitted with a six-cylinder <b>Sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engine</b> of 2,910 cc, bought in from Willys-Overland of Ohio. Approximately 150 of these were constructed.|$|E
50|$|The 17/50 used a {{straight}} six, single <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engine</b> of 2370 cc driving {{the rear wheels}} through a four speed gearbox. Suspension was by semi elliptic leaf springs at the front and cantilever springs at the rear.|$|E
50|$|In 1909, {{he became}} {{interested}} in the Knight patent (<b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engine)</b> and was first in France to build that type of engine which Panhard et Levassor would produce during the thirty years leading up to World War II.|$|E
5000|$|Continental in the United States {{conducted}} {{extensive research}} in single <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engines,</b> pointing {{that they were}} eventually of lower production cost, and easier to produce. However, their aircraft engines soon equalled the single <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> engines' performance by introducing improvements such as sodium-cooled poppet valves, and it seems also {{that the costs of}} this research, along with the October 1929 crisis, led to the Continental single-sleeve-valve engines not entering mass production. A book (Continental! Its motors and its people. W Wagner, 1983. [...] ) on Continental Engines reports that General Motors had conducted tests with single <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engines,</b> rejecting this kind of arrangement, and, according to M Hewland (Car&Driver, July 1974) also Ford around 1959.|$|R
50|$|Rolls-Royce Exe, an {{air-cooled}} <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> prototype <b>engine.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Lyons-Knight was an American {{automobile}} manufactured from 1913 until 1915. A {{product of}} Indianapolis, {{the cars were}} produced by the Lyons-Atlas Company and featured Knight <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engines</b> and worm-drive rear axles; they were designed by Harry A. Knox.|$|R
50|$|The Aquila was a nine-cylinder single-row radial {{aircraft}} engine {{designed by the}} Bristol Engine Company starting in 1934. A <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engine,</b> its basic design was developed from the Bristol Perseus. The Aquila was never used in production, but further developments led to the Bristol Hercules, Bristol Taurus, and Bristol Centaurus.|$|E
5000|$|The Rolls-Royce Pennine was a British 46-litre {{air-cooled}} <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engine</b> with 24 cylinders {{arranged in}} an X formation. It was an enlarged {{version of the}} 22-litre Exe; a prototype engine was built and tested, but never flew. [...] The project was terminated in 1945, being superseded by the jet engine.|$|E
5000|$|Among {{his many}} other works, he {{improved}} the engines {{that were used}} in the first tanks, oversaw the research into the physics of internal combustion that led to the use of octane ratings, was instrumental in development of the <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engine</b> design, and invented the Diesel [...] "Comet" [...] Swirl chamber that made high-speed diesel engines economically feasible.|$|E
5000|$|By 1925, all Panhard's {{cars were}} powered by Knight <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engines</b> that used steel sleeves. [...] The steel sleeves were thinner and {{lighter than the}} cast iron ones that had been fitted in Panhard <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engines</b> since 1910, and this already gave rise to an {{improved}} friction coefficient permitting engines to run at higher speeds. [...] To reduce further the risk of engines jamming, the outer sleeves, which are less thermally stressed than the inner sleeves, were coated on their inner sides with an anti-friction material, employing a patented technique with which Panhard engineers had been working since 1923. This {{was one of several}} improvements applied by Panhard engineers to the basic Knight sleeve-valve engine concept.|$|R
50|$|From 1910 Panhard {{worked to}} develop <b>engines</b> without {{conventional}} <b>valves,</b> using under license the <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> technology {{that had been}} patented by the American Charles Yale Knight. Between 1910 and 1924 the Panhard & Levassor catalogue listed plenty of models with conventional <b>valve</b> <b>engines,</b> but these were offered alongside cars powered by <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> power units. Following various detailed improvements to the <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> technology by Panhard's own engineering department, from 1924 till 1940 all Panhard cars used <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
50|$|The junk {{head was}} only widely used with <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engines.</b> These sealed {{on the inside}} of the sleeve, also sealing the sleeves {{themselves}} from the combustion pressure. It would also have been difficult to arrange a flat head gasket on the top of the moving sleeves.|$|R

50|$|John North Willys {{purchased}} the Edwards Motor Car Company of Long Island, New York, in 1913, moving the operation to Elyria, Ohio, where Willys owned the plant {{that had previously}} manufactured the Garford automobile. Production began with a four-cylinder model which was priced in the $2,500 price range. The Willys-Knight employed a Knight <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engine,</b> generally four- and six-cylinder models.|$|E
50|$|Six-cylinder Daimler <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engines</b> {{were used}} in the first British tanks in WW1, up to and {{including}} the Mark IV. As a result of the tendency of the engines to smoke and hence give away the tank positions, Harry Ricardo was brought in, and devised a new engine which replaced the <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> starting with the Mark V tank.|$|R

50|$|Most {{of these}} {{advantages}} were evaluated and established during the 1920s by Roy Fedden and Harry Ricardo, possibly the <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engine's</b> greatest advocate. He conceded {{that some of}} these advantages were significantly eroded as fuels improved up to and during World War II and as sodium-cooled exhaust valves were introduced in high-output aircraft engines.|$|R
50|$|They were {{expensive}} cars - large, luxurious and handsomely designed, {{a limousine}} being offered at {{as much as}} $5,600. Yet the firm kept using the two-stroke engine after it had become obsolete; a four-stroke was offered unsuccessfully in 1913. Gillette Motor Co took over the Amplex manufacturing facilities in 1916, but refused to manufacture conventional engine-valving, persisting with a rotary <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Falcon-Knight was {{intended}} to fit in price between the Willys Whippet and larger Willys Knight ranges and was priced $1250, $100 less than the Willys Knight 70A Roadster. It was powered by a six cylinder Knight <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engine.</b> Except for the engine, much of the car is actually {{the same as the}} Model 93A Whippet with many parts being interchangeable.|$|E
50|$|The Fleetwood-Knight was {{powered by}} a 6-cylinder Knight <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engine,</b> which gave {{excellent}} performance. The car was very well appointed, with gasoline and temperature gauges on the dashboard. Unfortunately for the Davises, the prototype cost between CDN$5,000 and CDN$6,000 to build, {{so it was not}} economically viable to put the car in production. The car was driven by members of the Davis family until sold, and was still in regular use in Renfrew, Ontario in the late 1960s.|$|E
50|$|Soon, however, Stearns {{turned away}} from performance. In 1911, the firm began {{installing}} Knight <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engines,</b> marketed under the Stearns-Knight brand name. By 1914, they had a 5.1-liter four and a 6.8-liter six, electric lighting, and electric starter. This {{was followed by a}} V8, one of the first companies to offer one, in 1917.|$|R

5000|$|The 23/70 {{shared the}} same basic layout as the 17/50 but was fitted with a straight-8 <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engine.</b> The exact {{capacity}} of the engine is quoted by various sources as between 2760 and 3293 cc. The engine {{was said to be}} vulnerable if taken above 3400 rpm. The car could be distinguished from its smaller companion by a large [...] "8" [...] on the radiator grille. A free wheel mechanism was offered as an option.|$|E
5000|$|The car was {{launched}} with a 6-cylinder in-line <b>Sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engine</b> of 2,344 cc, {{placing it in}} the 13CV car tax band. The factory bodied [...] "CS Type X68" [...] four door sedan/saloon/berline offered seating for 4/5 people and had a separate luggage locker at the back. There were also various coupé and Cabriolet bodied cars produced. By 1932, when the [...] "Type X68" [...] {{gave way to the}} [...] "Type X72", 1,028 of the former had been produced.|$|E
5000|$|As valves were a {{key issue}} in both {{approaches}} to improved performance, they had been a major area {{of research in the}} 1920s and 30s. In the UK, Harry Ricardo had written an influential paper on the sleeve valve system for exactly these reasons, claiming {{it was the only way}} forward. He had some success in selling this idea, most notably to Bristol Aeroplane Company Engines, where Roy Fedden became [...] "a believer". Ricardo's friendly competitor, Frank Halford, designed his own <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engine</b> with Napier & Son, another prominent British engine maker.|$|E
25|$|Daimler's <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engines</b> idle silently {{but they}} left a slight haze of oil smoke {{trailing}} behind them. These engines consumed oil {{at a rate}} of up to an Imperial gallon every 450 miles, oil being needed to lubricate the sleeves particularly when cold. However, by the standards of their day they required very little maintenance.|$|R
50|$|In the 1920s Barr & Stroud Ltd started {{offering}} <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> motorcycle <b>engines</b> {{based on}} a design by Peter Burt and L.J. McCollum. In a half-page advert in Motor Cycle magazine in 1922 they encouraged readers to contact them at Anniesland, Glasgow, for more information, or contact the manufacturers currently offering their 350cc single cylinder engine, naming Beardmore-Precision, Royal Scot, Edmund and Diamond motorcycles. In 1923 a new motorcycle manufacturer, Grindlay-Peerless offered a 999cc V-twin Barr & Stroud engined motorcycle, later adding a 500cc and 350cc single. They also offered J.A.P. engines, and it appears the racing success of the J.A.P. engines made them the preferred choice, and so the <b>sleeve</b> <b>valve</b> <b>engines</b> were dropped in 1927.|$|R
50|$|They {{merged with}} Arrol-Johnston in 1927 {{following}} which production moved to Dumfries, Scotland and the cars {{became known as}} Arrol-Asters. The Wembley premises were kept as a service depot eventually being sold to Singer. The 21/60 and 24/70 were kept in production and were joined by a straight eight 2760 cc <b>sleeve</b> <b>valved</b> <b>engine</b> 23/70 and 17/50 six which was also available with Cozette supercharger.|$|R
