5|$|Adrienne's head {{is split}} open by a {{swinging}} pendulum blade in one death scene, an effect that took several hours to set up. A fake head was created from a model cast of actress Victoria Morsell's head, with pumps installed to pump fake blood into it, and strings attached {{to either side}} {{so it could be}} pulled apart. The crew only had one head model, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> keep putting it back together and reusing it over and over for each take. After filming was completed, the crew put the head back together and took a picture of Morsell with it.|$|E
5|$|Several {{times between}} 1978–89, the two wild-card games {{had to be}} played on {{different}} days. Normally they both would be held on Sunday. In 1983 and 1988, the games were split between Saturday and Monday because Sunday was Christmas, and the NFL had avoided playing on that day at the time. In 1984, both games were played in the Pacific Time Zone, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be played on Saturday and Sunday to accommodate for time differences. In 1985, both the New York Giants and Jets hosted wild-card games. As they have shared a home stadium since 1984, the games had to be played on different days.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} {{considered}} second-class battleships, lightly constructed, armed, and armoured by British standards; Swiftsure, in fact, suffered from structural weakness while in service and required hull strengthening, although Triumph {{did not have}} such problems. Chile had required the ships {{to fit into the}} graving dock at Talcahuano, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be longer and narrower for their displacement than ships built to British standards. Details in mast and anchor arrangements as well as the arrangement of magazines and shell-handling rooms also were different from British standards.|$|E

5|$|A battle {{fought in}} this zone and tragic for the Israelis was {{completely}} eclipsed from their collective memory. On 18 July, a company from the 1st Battalion of Yiftach Brigade received {{the order to}} capture Qirbet Quriqur, an outpost protecting {{the only way for}} the Legion to get to Latrun located several kilometres {{to the north of the}} place. Intelligence services had not informed the responsible officer that nearby there was another outpost, occupied by a reinforced company of the Legion. From there the legionnaires could observe all the operations of the Israelis and called for reinforcements, notably armoured vehicles. When they mounted the counter-attack, the Israelis were taken by a lightning strike in an encircling movement. No troops were available there to reinforce them, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> retreat in plain daylight. 45 Israeli soldiers, nineteen of them aged 18 or less, lost their lives.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Gowing became Reader in Contemporary History {{at the new}} University of Kent, Canterbury, {{covering}} scientific, technical, {{economic and}} social history. The UKAEA retained her as a consultant, paying her £1,000 per annum for three years. Her main task was to write a two-volume sequel to Britain and Atomic Energy 1939–1945 covering the period from 1945 to 1952. To help out, the UKAEA brought in Lorna Arnold from its Health and Safety Division in 1967 to become the Departmental Records Officer (DRO) and Gowing's Assistant Historian. Despite their being accredited as official historians, the Atomic Weapons Establishment would not let them take their notes away, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do their writing on site, {{under the watchful eye}} of Aldermaston's DRO. To get there Gowing had to catch the train each day from Canterbury to London Waterloo station, and then the Tube to Paddington and the railway to Reading, where Arnold picked Gowing up in her car and drove to Harwell.|$|E
5|$|Chambers and {{his second}} in command, Captain Charles Spragg, {{immediately}} set about constructing a defensive trench across the post, and strengthening its other defences. But by now the Turks, from the 72nd Infantry Regiment, about 1,000-strong, had managed to use the terrain and darkness to close in on the position. At 22:00 Chambers reported that the position was under attack and surrounded, and at 23:35 the telephone line to headquarters was cut by the Turks. The area in front of No.3 Post was in a gully {{and out of sight}} to the defenders, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> climb on the trench parapet to engage the Turks. This tactic worked well, and they broke up the Turkish assault, causing the attackers some casualties. The Turks did not withdraw far, and crept up {{to the edge of the}} New Zealanders' trench during the night. They then threw hand grenades into the New Zealanders' position. At the same time, small arms fire from the surrounding Turkish positions pinned the New Zealanders down.|$|E

5|$|Johnson then removed Hutton for 57 {{without further}} {{addition}} to the total, caught by Bradman on the run, leaving England at 129/2. The Yorkshire batsman went for a lofted shot and mistimed it {{high in the air}} after being beaten in flight, and the Australian captain ran backwards from mid-on to complete the catch. This meant the two new batsmen at the crease, Edrich and Compton, were still yet to score, and the second new ball was only six overs away, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> preserve their wickets while conditions were at their most favourable for Australia's fast bowlers. During a slow period in which only 15 runs came in half an hour, Edrich and Compton were pinned down by defensive field settings with no slips in place. After 45 minutes, Compton premeditated a charge down the pitch and hit Johnson to the leg side for a boundary. The pair accelerated, Compton taking risks in cutting Johnson against the spin. Australia took the new ball and each batsman hit a boundary to bring up the fifty partnership, which took an hour. Worried by the substantial and hazardous craters he and the other bowlers had created in the pitch while following through on the left-hand side of the crease, Lindwall changed to bowling from around the wicket and was warned by umpire Baldwin for running on the pitch, before reverting to over the wicket, although he delivered {{from the edge of the}} crease to avoid the holes. O'Reilly said Baldwin's warning to Lindwall had played into Australia's hands as the bowler's follow through from around the wicket was accentuating a rough patch outside the right-hander's off stump, which the English bowlers could target when Bradman's men had to chase the target. Compton then hit boundaries with hooks and pulls from Lindwall and Johnston and England went to tea at 209/2. Compton was on 42 and Edrich 33.|$|E
25|$|The FA Cup was {{a success}} {{and within a few}} years all of the clubs in England wanted to take part. To do <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> accept the FA code, which led to the quick spread of a {{universal}} set of rules.

25|$|Human {{dissection}} {{was also}} practised by Renaissance artists. Though most chose {{to focus on}} the external surfaces of the body, some like Michelangelo Buonarotti, Antonio del Pollaiolo, Baccio Bandinelli, and Leonardo da Vinci sought a deeper understanding. However, there were no provisions for artists to obtain cadavers, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> resort to unauthorised means, as indeed anatomists sometimes did, such as grave robbing, body snatching, and murder.|$|E

25|$|The {{epidemic}} spread quickly, assuming startling proportions in Damascus, {{along the}} lines of communication south of the city, and also to the north. Virtually all sick in the early stages were serious cases. Medical supplies quickly became short, while supplies of suitable food for a light diet were inadequate and blankets and mattresses ran short as there were no facilities to disinfect them <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be destroyed in many instances.|$|E
25|$|Director {{and film}} crew {{spent more than}} 13 months at the Dumont d'Urville Station, where the Institut polaire français Paul-Émile Victor is based.

25|$|A protest rally on {{the night}} of 6 September, {{organised}} by the authorities in Istanbul, on the Cyprus issue and the bombing of Atatürk's home was the cover for amassing the rioters. At 13:00, news reports of the bombing were announced by radio. However, most people at the time did not have radios, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> wait until 16:30, when the daily İstanbul Ekspres, which was associated with the DP and the National Security Service (NSS), repeated the news in print.|$|E

25|$|West Germany, who {{had been}} {{reinstated}} as full FIFA members only in 1950 and were unseeded, convincingly won {{the first of two}} encounters with the seeded Turkish side at Wankdorf stadium in Berne. The Koreans, the other unseeded team, lost 7–0 and 9–0, with West Germany being denied the chance to play such an easy opponent. Sepp Herberger, the West German coach, gambled against the seeded team of Hungary by sending in a reserve side, and lost 8–3; <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> play off against Turkey, a match that West Germany easily won.|$|E
25|$|The Confederate {{ships were}} ready for the attack, and they moved into {{position}} to intercept the Union fleet just beyond the minefield. At 6:47a.m., Tecumseh fired the first shot, the forts replied, and the action became general. The ships in the second column (except for Brooklyn) could not reply to the guns of the Confederate vessels, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> concentrate on the fort. Most of {{the damage done to}} the Federal fleet was caused by the enemy ships, perhaps because the fire from the fort was suppressed.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the wind}} was calm, Cali's {{controllers}} asked the pilots whether they wanted to fly a straight-in approach to runway 19 rather than coming around to runway 01. The pilots agreed, hoping to make up some time. The pilots then erroneously cleared the approach waypoints from their navigation computer. When the controller asked the pilots to check back in over Tuluá, north of Cali, {{it was no longer}} programmed into the computer, and <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> pull out their maps to find it. In the meantime, they extended the aircraft's speed brakes to slow it down and expedite its descent.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} half, Kansas City drove 67 {{yards to the}} Broncos 3-yard line, {{starting}} with Grbac's 34-yard pass to Rison on the first play. But on third and goal, rookie tight end Tony Gonzalez was unable to keep both feet in bounds while making a catch, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> settle for Stoyanovich's 20-yard field goal that made the score 7–3. Denver had a big opportunity to respond on their next drive when Davis ran for a 41-yard gain to the Chiefs 11-yard line. But Derek Loville ended up losing a fumble that safety Reggie Tongue recovered. Following an exchange of punts, Grbac's 50-yard completion to receiver Joe Horn advanced {{the ball to the}} Broncos 15-yard line, and Gonzalez eventually caught a 12-yard touchdown pass to give Kansas City their first lead of the game, 10–7, going into the fourth quarter.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{receiving}} the opening kickoff, CSU promptly went three-and-out, giving {{the ball back}} to WSU, who started their drive in CSU territory after a 23-yard punt. WSU entered the red zone, but ultimately settled for an Andrew Furney field goal {{to take the lead}} by 15 (38–23). CSU's ensuing drive lasted only one play – a 75-yard touchdown run by Kapri Bibbs that made the score 38–30, with Washington State retaining the eight-point advantage. Though they reached the red zone on their next drive, Cory James sacked Halliday twice, and then WSU committed a delay of game penalty, which ultimately moved them out of field goal range, <b>so</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> punt. They had another opportunity, starting in CSU territory after Jordon Vaden fumbled the ball on a run after a catch, but punted then too. At {{the end of the third}} quarter, WSU led 38–30.|$|E
25|$|Also in 1602 two {{merchant}} ships sailed {{from the}} Philippines to New Spain. They were beset by storms {{and unable to}} complete the voyage. The Santa Maria took refuge in the Ladrones Guam for forty days before sailing back to Manila. They were {{able to pick up}} most of the Spaniards left there by the Santa Margarita in 1600. The other ship, the Espiritu Santo, having lost its mainmast, put into port in Japan. There they were on the point of being held captive by the Japanese, who apparently intended to gain control of its cargo. Nevertheless, they did manage to sail out of the harbor with a jury-rigged mainmast. To do <b>so,</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> leave a few hostage crewmen behind and cut a rattan cable across the harbor entrance. There was some gunfire on both sides, and a few people were killed.|$|E
