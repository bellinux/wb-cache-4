40|$|Purpose: The paper {{presents}} {{computer simulation}} results of displacement, strain and stresses in the plate used in {{treatment of the}} pectus excavatum. Design/methodology/approach: The numerical analysis was performed for selected models of the <b>stabilizing</b> <b>plates</b> made of the Cr-Ni-Mo stainless steel (AISI 316 L) and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V ELI alloy. Findings: The displacement, strain and stress analyses showed the diverse results depending on the plates geometry and {{the properties of the}} applied metallic biomaterial. The numerical analysis shows that stresses in plates didn’t exceed the yield point: for the stainless steel Rp 0, 2 min= 690 MPa and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V ELI - Rp 0, 2 min= 895 MPa. Research limitations/implications: The limitations were connected both with the necessity of simplifications applied to the numerical model and with the established boundary conditions.

30|$|The dynamic {{compression}} hip screw (DHS) {{has been a}} popular method of internal fixation for subtrochanteric fractures [3]. It provides compression along the femoral neck, and if the reduced fracture is stable, load-sharing between the bone and implant can occur [1, 4]. However, if the fracture is not stable, progressive medial displacement of the femoral shaft can occur, which may result in fixation failure and nonunion. Failures increased sevenfold, if medialization of more than 1 / 3 of the femoral diameter at the fracture site occurred [4, 5]. The concept of the DHS with a trochanteric <b>stabilizing</b> <b>plate</b> is to prevent or reduce medial displacement [6]. However, if the trochanteric <b>stabilizing</b> <b>plate</b> impedes further compression of the fracture before the fracture has become stable, the fracture may angulate into varus with lag screw cut-out, loosening or breaking the plate as a result [4]. The Medoff sliding plate (MSP) evolved from the DHS and gives axial compression along both the femoral neck and shaft. It produced excellent results in one prospective trial on subtrochanteric fractures [4]. However, Miedel et al. [7] reported {{a high rate of}} failure when the MSP was used in fixation of subtrochanteric fractures.|$|R
30|$|The large {{proximal}} {{screw in}} the compression hip screw system obtains excellent purchase in the proximal fragment [11], {{and the ability}} of the screw shaft to slide in the collar of the plate allows for impaction of the fracture surfaces [10]. The sliding also permits slight medial displacement of the shaft in relationship to the proximal fragment. This tends to reduce the bending moment and the resulting forces that lead to collapse of the medial buttress and varus displacement [1, 10]. For this sliding to occur, the plate must not be fixed with screws into the proximal fragment [10] (Figs.  2, 3). The beneficial effect of this technical suggestion has been confirmed in the current study. In one of our patients, a longitudinal gap (> 2  mm) in the medial buttress was detected in the postoperative radiograph. The unblocked dynamization of the DHS obliterated this gap through slight medialization of the distal fragment [10] (Fig.  2 a–d). Similarly, Lunsjö et al. [4] reported loosening of the plate in a well-reduced subtrochanteric fracture fixed with the dynamic hip screw with trochanteric <b>stabilizing</b> <b>plate</b> (DHS/TSP); they suggested that the trochanteric <b>stabilizing</b> <b>plate</b> impeded lag screw dynamization.|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{measurements}} on axisymmetric laminar premixed flames {{have been used}} extensively for chemical and soot model validation. Numerical simulations of these flames always rely on the assumption of one-dimensionality. However, the presumed one-dimensionality has not been justified in general, {{and may not be}} valid under all circumstances. In the current work, two-dimensional flow effects are investigated in four representative ethylene/air laminar premixed flames, which have been selected as validation targets for the International Sooting Flame workshop. These flames cover all typical experimental arrangements, namely <b>stabilizing</b> <b>plate,</b> steel plate with centered hole, and enclosed chamber. To assess the assumption of one-dimensionality, detailed numerical simulations with finite-rate chemistry are performed with the exact experimental set-ups. It is shown that flow entrainment and acceleration are significant for all four flames. Further, it is found that the flame centerlines cannot be approximated as one-dimensional, since the mass flow rates vary substantially along the centerlines. As a consequence, non-negligible differences are found between the soot profiles predicted in two-dimensional simulations and in simulations where one-dimensionality is assumed. Using data extracted from the two-dimensional simulations, a modified one-dimensional model is derived on the flame centerline to include two-dimensional effects. Results from the modified one-dimensional model are compared against detailed, two-dimensional simulation results and experimental measurements...|$|R

The MSP has biaxial dynamic capacity along both the neck and the shaft of the femur unlike the other systems, which lack dynamic capacity along the shaft. 268 fractures were operated on with the MSP, and 301 with the dynamic hip screw (DHS), with or without a trochanteric <b>stabilizing</b> <b>plate</b> (DHS/TSP) or with the dynamic condylar screw (DCS). The MSP had recently been shown to the surgeons. The patients in the groups were similar as regards age, domestic situation, preinjury walking ability and type of fracture. We followed the patients clinically and radiographically for at least 1 year. There {{was no significant difference in}} walking ability at follow-up or rate of return to home. Fixation failure occurred in 18 / 268 fractures operated on with the MSP, in 8 / 238 with the DHS, in 3 / 49 with the DHS/TSP and in 1 / 14 with the DCS. The difference in the rate of fixation failure was not statistically significant when the MSP group was compared to the 3 other groups. In 14 of the 18 fixation failures in the MSP group, the biaxial dynamic capacity of the MSP had not been used due to technical errors by surgeons, unfamiliar with the new method. No selection bias was found regarding fracture types in the 2 subgroups of patients with correct or inadequate biaxial dynamization. Extramedullary fixation of unstable intertrochanteric fractures with these implants showed a low failure rate. When using the MSP, biaxial dynamization must be correctly performed...|$|R
30|$|In {{situations}} of severe deformity or limited remaining growth potential, growth modulation techniques {{may not be}} effective. In these circumstances, the only surgical solution is an osteotomy. Osteotomy may be performed acutely and the knee subsequently <b>stabilized</b> with <b>plates</b> and screws. Alternatively, gradual correction using a uniplanar or multiplanar external fixation frame may be employed. Both acute and gradual corrections are associated with potential complications. Acute correction risks injury to the common peroneal nerve. Bones are generally small and osteopenic [44], and subsequent fixation with implants (plates and screws) may be difficult.

40|$|Background: To {{evaluate}} {{the utility of}} additional fixation methods and to suggest a method of reduction {{in the treatment of}} unstable pertrochanteric femur fractures with a sliding hip screw (SHS). Methods: A retrospective study was performed on thirty patients with unstable pertrochanteric femur fractures, who were operated on with a SHS between September 2004 and September 2009 and were followed up for at least 6 months. The additional fixation devices were as follows; antirotation screw (21 cases), fixation of displaced fractures of the posteromedial bone fragment (cerclage wiring, 21 cases and screw, 2 cases) and trochanter <b>stabilizing</b> <b>plate</b> (27 cases). Clinically, the Palmer’s mobility score and Jensen’s social function group were used. Radiologically, alignment and displacement were observed. The tip-apex distance (TAD) and sliding of the lag screw were measured, and the position of the lag screw within the femoral head was also examined. Results: The mean age at the time of surgery was 76 years (range, 56 to 89 years) and the average follow-up period was 25 months (range, 6 to 48 months). At the last follow-up, the average mobility and social function score was 6. 2 (± 3. 5) and 2. 3 (± 1. 5).

The aim of our study was to assess whether use of the TRIGEN INTERTAN nail, as compared with a sliding hip screw, resulted in less postoperative pain, improved functional mobility, and reduced surgical complication rates for patients with an intertrochanteric or subtrochanteric fracture. Methods: In a prospective, randomized multicenter study, 684 elderly patients were treated with the INTERTAN nail or with a sliding hip screw with or without a trochanteric <b>stabilizing</b> <b>plate.</b> The patients were assessed during their hospital stay and at three and twelve months postoperatively. A visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score was recorded at all time points, and functional mobility was assessed with use of the timed Up & Go test. The Harris hip score (HHS) was used to assess hip function more specifically. Quality of life was measured with the EuroQol- 5 D (EQ- 5 D). Radiographic findings as well as intraoperative and postoperative complications were recorded and analyzed. Results: Patients treated with an INTERTAN nail had slightly less pain at the time of early postoperative mobilization (VAS score, 48 versus 52; p = 0. 042), although this did not influence the length of the hospital stay and there was no difference at three or twelve months. Regardless of the fracture and implant type, functional mobility, hip function, patient satisfaction, and quality-of-life assessments were comparable between the groups at three and twelve months. The numbers of patients with surgical complications were similar for the two groups (twenty-nine in the sliding-hip-screw group and thirty-two in the INTERTAN group, p = 0. 67). Conclusions: INTERTAN nails and sliding hip screws are similar in terms of pain, function, and reoperation rates twelve months after treatment of intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric fractures. </p...|$|R
30|$|The ideal {{treatment}} for displaced intraarticular calcaneal fractures remains controversial.

Design: Retrospective case matched study. Setting: Two orthopaedic trauma centers. Patients: 174 distal femur fracture were re-viewed to extract cases treated with retrograde IM nails (NAIL group, n= 12). These were then individually matched to cases treated with locking plates (Plate group, n= 12). Intervention: Retrograde IM nailing or locking plate fracture fixation. Outcome Measures: Periosteal callus was mea-sured on lateral and antero-posterior radiographs taken at 12 weeks after injury using validated software to objectively extract the size of peripheral callus from digital radiographs. Results: The NAIL group had 2. 4 times more callus area per location (231 ± 304 mm 2) than the PLATE group (95 ± 109 mm 2, p= 0. 028). Compared to the PLATE group, the NAIL group had 3. 4 times more callus anteriorly (p= 0. 31), 2. 6 times more callus posteriorly (p= 0. 25), and 2. 3 times more callus medially (p= 0. 16).

30|$|Because {{there is}} enough bone stock to <b>stabilize</b> a {{fixation}} <b>plate,</b> subcondylar fractures may be amenable to rigid fixation. Though there are different approaches for the fixation of mandibular subcondylar fractures, that area can be typically well visualized using instrument such as Bauer retractors, followed by anatomic reduction transorally [2]. In this case, fractured fragment displaced laterally and patient {{did not want to}} make operation scars in her face. Mandibular angle ostectomy can be also performed transorally [3]. So we chose intraoral approach. The intraoral approach for mandibular surgery offers many advantages that minimize the risks of visible scars and facial nerve injury. But the limitation of that approach is a narrow surgical field, which makes it difficult to view the operative site directly. So there is possibility of surgical and esthetic complications. In this case, we experienced the fractures of fixation plates.|$|R

The {{effect of}} tetrapod-shaped alpha tricalcium {{phosphate}} granules (Tetrabones ® [TB]) {{in combination with}} {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} (bFGF) -binding ion complex gel (f-IC gel) on bone defect repair was examined. Bilateral segmental defects 20 -mm long were created in the radius of 5 dogs, <b>stabilized</b> with a <b>plate</b> and screws and implanted with 1 of the following: TB (TB group), TB and bFGF solution (TB/f group), and TB and f-IC gel (TB/f-IC group). Dogs were euthanized 4 weeks after surgery. Radiographs showed well-placed TB granules in the defects and equal osseous callus formation in all the groups. Histomorphometry revealed that the number of vessels and volume of new bone in the TB/f-IC group were significantly higher than those in the other groups. However, no significant differences in neovascularization and new bone formation were observed between the TB/f and TB groups. Furthermore, no significant difference in th...|$|R
40|$|Successful {{implementation}} of 3 D integration technology requires {{understanding of the}} unique yield and reliability issues associated with through-silicon vias (TSVs), with adequate design and process considerations to address these issues. This paper relates to the characterization of thermomechanical stress and reliability issues for Cu-filled TSVs designed for use in 3 D Si interposers and 3 D wafer-level packaging applications. The paper will describe {{a variety of methods}} for characterization of Cu TSV fill quality, microstructure, and thermally-induced TSV height increase known as "copper protrusion" or "copper pumping. " An Xray imaging method was used for fast, nondestructive analysis of Cu TSV plating profiles and detection of trapped voids. In addition, a plasma focused ion beam (plasma-FIB) process was used to generate high quality cross sections of full TSVs, 50 m in diameter and 150 m depth. Imaging of TSVs by Ga FIB channeling contrast and electron backscattered d iffraction (EBSD) provided information about Cu microstructure, including quantitative analysis of grain size. It was observed that TSVs exposed to elevated temperatures exhibited a substantial increase in grain size, which was associated with the Cu protrusion effect. This paper will also report the results of TSV integration with subsequent layers, with analysis of thermo-mechanical failures due to interactions between Cu TSVs and adjacent dielectric layers. The use of an anneal step to <b>stabilize</b> the <b>plated</b> Cu TSVs, prior to build-up of subsequent dielectric layers, will be described...|$|R
40|$|U lna {{shortening}} osteotomy is {{an accepted}} treatment modality to address ulna impac-tion syndrome, especially {{in patients with}} persistent symptoms after arthroscopic resection of the articular disk. 1 During this procedure, some form of dynamic compression plate is commonly used to <b>stabilize</b> the bone. <b>Plate</b> placement has been reported on the dorsal, 2 ulnar, 3 and palmar surface 4 of the ulna. However, despite a considerable num-ber of publications, which report the overall out-come after this procedure, it is currently unknown {{whether there is an}} advantage of one plate location over the others concerning the incidence of hard-ware irritations, the number of secondary proce-dures, and overall clinical outcomes. Some authors have suggested ulnar or palmar placement to be su-perior to dorsal placement because of better cover-age by the forearm muscles, whereas others prefer dorsal placement. 2, 4, 5 The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare clini-cal outcomes after ulnar shortening osteotomy in relation to different locations of the osteotomy plate...|$|R
