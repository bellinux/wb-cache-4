5|$|The list {{of former}} Registrars {{published}} by the university in the 19th century begins with John London, who died in 1508. Records show {{that there were people}} before London carrying out <b>similar</b> <b>tasks</b> in the 15th century, and the university regards the role as having a 550-year history. There is a record of a resolution by the university, of uncertain date in the 15th century, that a registrar or scribe should be appointed to draft letters, record the university's public acts, copy its documents, and record the names of graduates. The position carried an annual salary of four marks (£2 13 shillings and 4 pence); fees had to be paid to the Registrar by individuals obtaining their degrees or recording other permissions granted by the university. In 1448, a John Manyngham signed a letter for the university, and was permitted in 1451 to have a scholar make transcripts in the university's library; one historian of the university says that Manyngham may have been Oxford's first Registrar. John Farley, who signed his name in Greek letters as a sign of his erudition, carried out the duties from 1458 to 1464.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of popular MMORPGs {{are based on}} traditional fantasy themes, often occurring in an in-game universe {{comparable to that of}} Dungeons & Dragons. Some employ hybrid themes that either merge or replace fantasy elements with those of science fiction, sword and sorcery, or crime fiction. Still, others draw thematic material from American comic books, the occult, and other genres. Often, these elements are developed using <b>similar</b> <b>tasks</b> and scenarios involving quests, monsters, and loot.|$|E

However, the Up Next feature does not include features that used to be found in iTunes DJ, such as the ability for guests to request songs, does not provide as much information as the playlist view, and requires juggling multiple windows and floating dialogs to perform <b>similar</b> <b>tasks.</b>|$|E
25|$|The timing flaw {{consisted}} of performing two tasks simultaneously—compressing previously acquired data to release space for more data, {{and making a}} second copy of the approach command sequence—that together overloaded the spacecraft's primary computer. After the overload was detected, the spacecraft performed as designed: it switched from the primary computer to the backup computer, entered safe mode, and sent a distress call back to Earth. The distress call was received the afternoon of July 4, which alerted engineers {{that they needed to}} contact the spacecraft to get more information and resolve the issue. The resolution was that the problem happened as part of preparations for the approach, and was not expected to happen again because no <b>similar</b> <b>tasks</b> were planned {{for the remainder of the}} encounter.|$|E

25|$|The reform {{also brought}} the Sovereign Council of New France (Conseil souverain) into existence, which was later renamed the Superior Council (Conseil supérieur). The Sovereign Council {{effectively}} acted as the functional {{equivalent of a}} Council of State (Conseil d'État) for New France, having the authority to hand down verdicts on final appeal. Initially, the Council convened once every week, and the quorum of the Sovereign Council was seven for criminal matters, or five for civil cases. The Council's practices evolved over time. At the Sovereign Council there was a king's attorney-general (procureur général du roi) {{in charge of the}} <b>similar</b> <b>tasks</b> as the district king's attorneys. He was also responsible for supervising the king's attorneys' daily operations as well as execution of royal edicts and regulations passed by the Council in their respective districts.|$|E

He stated that this was [...] "a hundred times more difficult" [...] than <b>similar</b> <b>tasks</b> at Bullfrog Productions. By March, the team had expanded to 17 people including five artists, five game programmers, two engine programmers, and a sound programmer. Lionhead wanted a maximum of 25 people {{so as not to}} break the [...] "team spirit" [...] atmosphere. Black & White was shown at E3 1999 where it was judged the most original game.

500|$|Her Story was {{approved}} through Steam Greenlight, and was crowdfunded by Indie Fund. It {{was released on}} 24 June 2015 for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and iOS. Barlow wanted to launch the game on all platforms simultaneously, as he was unsure where the audience would be. [...] "If I'd just gone for just one I'd have {{lost a lot of}} the potential audience," [...] he commented. Barlow found that playing Her Story on mobile devices is a [...] "'sofa' experience". He also noted that it felt [...] "natural" [...] for it to be released on mobile devices, as they are regularly used to watch videos and search the internet; <b>similar</b> <b>tasks</b> are used as gameplay mechanics in Her Story. The iPhone's smaller pixel size of 640×480 as opposed to 800×600 led to Barlow's doubts of a release on the platform, but he was influenced to release it upon receiving positive feedback through testing. As development neared completion, the game underwent testing, which allowed Barlow to [...] "balance some aspects" [...] and [...] "polish items together". An Android version was released on 29 June 2016. Her Story runs on the Unity game engine.|$|E

2500|$|Though {{they were}} now living in Hawaii, the Japanese picture brides still felt it was {{important}} to preserve their traditions and heritage. The values they tried to instill in their children were filial piety, obligation to community and authority (on in the Japanese language), reciprocal obligation (giri in Japanese), the importance of hard work, perseverance, frugality, and a drive for success (seiko in Japanese). Many picture brides worked on the plantations. In 1920 fourteen percent of the workers on the plantations were female, and of those female workers, eighty percent were Japanese. On the plantation they usually irrigated and weeded the fields, stripped cane of dry leaves, or cut seed cane. Men were given <b>similar</b> <b>tasks,</b> but were often paid more. For example, in 1915 Japanese women plantation workers made 55 cents compared to the 78 cents made by their male counterparts.|$|E

2500|$|Bradykinesia and akinesia: [...] {{the former}} is {{slowness}} of movement, while the latter {{is the absence of}} it. It is the most characteristic clinical feature of PD, and is associated with difficulties along the whole course of the movement process, from planning to initiation and finally execution of a movement. The performance of sequential and simultaneous movements is also hindered. Bradykinesia is the most disabling symptom {{in the early stages of}} the disease. Initial manifestations of bradykinesia are problems when performing daily life tasks requiring fine motor control such as writing, sewing, or getting dressed. Clinical evaluation is based in <b>similar</b> <b>tasks</b> consisting such as alternating movements between both hands or feet. Bradykinesia is not equal for all movements or times. It is modified by the activity or emotional state of the subject to the point of some patients who are barely able to walk being capable of riding a bicycle. Generally, patients have less difficulties when some sort of external cue is provided.|$|E
2500|$|After a [...] "long and tiresome" [...] {{administrative}} {{trip through}} Northern Dobruja, which he considered retelling as a novel, Munteanu began collecting his poetry into one [...] "tiny volume", the 1909 Aripi negre ("Black Wings"). While he remained close to Dragomirescu, {{for whom he}} maintained [...] "an unbound intellectual sympathy", Munteanu eventually moved on. From 1911 to 1916, he was a contributor to Flacăra. His activity was interrupted by World War I and the battles on the Romanian front. In 1916–1917, he was in Bârlad as a military prosecutor, visiting with Alexandru Vlahuță and joining the literary club known as Academia Bârlădeană, also frequented by George Tutoveanu, Victor Ion Popa, and Vasile Voiculescu. He had begun writing religious-themed poems such as Golgota, which Vlahuță reportedly asked him to recite at every Academia meeting, and more specifically his first sonnets. Munteanu had {{also served as a}} magistrate at Piatra Neamț, Iași, Bazargic, Câmpulung, Brăila, and, during the interwar, performed <b>similar</b> <b>tasks</b> in Sibiu, Odorhei, Deva and ultimately Chișinău. In July 1919, he was royal prosecutor at the trial of Hungarian academic István Apáthy, accused of [...] "conspiracy against Romanian citizens" [...] during the war over Transylvania.|$|E

(Bill) Meldrum, known as 1 Detachment, 1st Ranger Squadron, New Zealand Special Air Service, departed for Malaysia. However, {{as a result of a}} perceived operational security breach Meldrum was replaced by Major Brian Worsnop from 3 April 1965. After a period of training with 22 SAS, 1 Detachment inserted its initial patrols on 8 April 1965. 1 Detachment carried out patrols, stopping for a training break from June to July 1965, until it was replaced by 2 Detachment on 11 October 1965. 2 Detachment was commanded by Major Rod Dearing and again considered of 40 men. It performed <b>similar</b> <b>tasks</b> to 1 Detachment, 2 Detachments later patrols were conducted in the Sabah area which was [...] "particularly rugged, steep and rocky". The detachment was withdrawn from operations on 10 Feb 1966, and was replaced by 3 Detachment which was commanded by Major David Ogilvy, who had previously deployed to Malaya with the original NZSAS Squadron. 3 Detachment conducted patrols from February, with Detachment's last patrol conducted over the period 16 to 28 May 1966, which was also the last CLARET patrol conducted by the NZSAS. 4 Detachment arrived in Borneo in June 1966 {{under the command of}} Major David Moloney, just after CLARET operations had been stopped. As a result, this Detachment was utilised to continue a 'hearts-and-mind' campaign to gain support of local Punan tribes living near the border. On 12 August 1966 a formal peace treaty was signed by Indonesia and Malaysia and with the Confrontation finally at an end, 4 Detachment officially became non-operational on 9 September 1966. However the Detachment remained in Borneo until October 1966 before it returned to New Zealand.|$|E
