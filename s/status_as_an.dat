5|$|In 1934, Horch {{arranged}} to have Master Institute of United Arts, Inc., the educational corporation he had created in 1923, take over responsibility for the building from the organization he had previously used to run it. He did this because the Institute was free of debt and, due to its <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> educational organization, was tax-exempt.|$|E

Throughout the 1950s, he acted in films that {{justified}} his <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> action hero. Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum portrayed him as a swashbuckling action hero who also has a Robin Hood-like agenda of serving {{the poor and the}} downtrodden with the treasure he finds in the cave.|$|E
5|$|Sauerbrunn {{played for}} the Boston Renegades in the W-League in 2005. The W-League was often used by college players as a summer playing option because of its <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> open league, {{allowing}} college players to maintain eligibility.

5|$|The Corinthian {{order of}} {{architectural}} style originating from ancient Greece was the dominant architectural {{style in the}} age of Augustus and the imperial phase of Rome. Suetonius once commented that Rome was unworthy of its <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> imperial capital, yet Augustus and Agrippa set out to dismantle this sentiment by transforming the appearance of Rome upon the classical Greek model.|$|E
5|$|The Eskaya {{community}} has been the object of ongoing controversy, particularly with regards to its <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> indigenous group and the classification of the Eskayan language.

5000|$|The life of Incitatus is {{the subject}} of Zbigniew Herbert's poem [...] "Caligula" [...] (in Pan Cogito, 1974). In Jack of Fables, by Bill Willingham and Matthew Sturges, Incitatus talks so much that he risks giving away his <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fable and {{frequently}} mentions his former <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Roman senator.|$|R
5|$|As {{an iconic}} skill, bicycle kicks are an {{important}} part of association football culture. Executing a bicycle kick in a competitive football match, particularly in scoring a goal, usually garners wide attention in the sports media. The bicycle kick has been featured in works of art, such as sculptures, films, advertisements, and literature. The manoeuvre is also used in other similar ball sports, particularly in the variants of association football like futsal and beach soccer. The controversy over the move's invention and name in Brazil, Chile, and Peru (and its <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> element of the notable Chile–Peru football rivalry) has added to the kick's acclaim in popular culture.|$|E
5|$|As {{opposed to}} the VZ and all models {{previous}} which used Opel-sourced platforms adapted both mechanically and in size for the local market, the whole-new VE programme is the first Commodore to be developed exclusively by Holden in Australia. Despite its <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> all-new model, engines—comprising the 3.6-litre V6 and more powerful 6.0-litre V8—have been largely carried over from the VZ series. Innovative features to help minimise export redevelopment costs, such as a symmetrical centre console housing a flush-fitting hand brake lever, facilitate the conversion to left-hand drive. Internationally, the VE was badge engineered as the Chevrolet Lumina, Chevrolet Omega and Pontiac G8.|$|E
5|$|At the May 2012 Digital Hollywood conference, Lindelof {{said that}} the videos {{originated}} from {{the question of the}} film's <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> Alien prequel.

He also {{said that the}} videos needed to be cool enough to justify their existence, but not so important that their absence from the final film would be an issue for audiences.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the success}} of Moo, You Bloody Choir, much of Augie March's post-album touring {{involved}} supporting other bands. They played shows supporting The Aliens and Andrew Bird in the United States, before returning to Australia to open for Crowded House. Richards said the band's <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> opening act, rather than headlining their own shows, was something they saw as a challenge—their intention was to win over fans who {{came to see the}} main act. However, he called the tour with The Aliens depressing; the bands played very different types of music, and the attendance at shows was small. Augie March later earned a prime slot at the 2008 Big Day Out.|$|E
5|$|In 1006 Ælfheah succeeded Ælfric as Archbishop of Canterbury, taking Swithun's {{head with}} him as a relic for the new location. He went to Rome in 1007 to receive his pallium—symbol of his <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> archbishop—from Pope John XVIII, but was robbed during his journey. While at Canterbury he {{promoted}} the cult of Dunstan, ordering {{the writing of the}} second Life of Dunstan, which Adelard of Ghent composed between 1006 and 1011. He also introduced new practices into the liturgy, and was instrumental in the Witenagemot's recognition of Wulfsige of Sherborne as a saint in about 1012.|$|E

5|$|In recent years, {{several other}} craters of {{around the same}} age as Chicxulub have been discovered, all between latitudes 20°N and 70°N. Examples include the disputed Silverpit crater in the North Sea and the Boltysh crater in Ukraine. Both are much smaller than Chicxulub, but are likely to have been caused by objects many tens of meters across {{striking}} the Earth. This has led to the hypothesis that the Chicxulub impact may have been only one of several impacts that happened nearly at the same time. Another possible crater thought to have been formed at the same time is the larger Shiva crater, though the structure's <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> impact crater is contested.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} its number of openly gay politicians, gay wedding ceremonies, pride events and gay-inclusive {{religious}} organizations relative {{to the size of}} the total population of the city, Minneapolis has one of the largest LGBT populations in the U.S. Noted for its strong music and performing arts scenes, Minneapolis is home to both the award-winning Guthrie Theater and the historic First Avenue nightclub. Reflecting the region's <b>status</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> epicenter of folk, funk, and alternative rock music, the city served as the launching pad for several of the 20th century's most influential musicians, including Bob Dylan and Prince.|$|E
