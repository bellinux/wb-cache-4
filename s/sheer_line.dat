40|$|This article {{presents}} a mathematical method for producing hard-chine ship hulls {{based on a}} set of numerical parameters that are directly related to the geometric features of the hull and uniquely define a hull form for this type of ship. The term planing hull is used generically to describe the majority of hard-chine boats being built today. This article is focused on unstepped, single-chine hulls. B-spline curves and surfaces were combined with constraints on the significant ship curves to produce the final hull design. The hard-chine hull geometry was modeled by decomposing the surface geometry into boundary curves, which were defined by design constraints or parameters. In planing hull design, these control curves are the center, chine, and <b>sheer</b> <b>lines</b> as well as their geometric features including position, slope, and, {{in the case of the}} chine, enclosed area and centroid. These geometric parameters have physical, hydrodynamic, and stability implications from the design point of view. The proposed method uses two-dimensional orthogonal projections of the control curves and then produces three-dimensional (3 -D) definitions using B-spline fitting of the 3 -D data points. The fitting considers maximum deviation from the curve to the data points and is based on an original selection of the parameterization. A net of B-spline curves (stations) is then created to match the previously defined 3 -D boundaries. A final set of lofting surfaces of the previous B-spline curves produces the hull surface...|$|R

5000|$|These are {{the most}} popular among homebuilders. Some {{professional}} builders also offer both kits and finished boats. The canoes are constructed by gluing together 1/4" [...] x 3/4" [...] strips of wood over a building jig consisting of station molds that define the shape of the hull. The forms are cut as a series of cross-sections of the final design and set up along a [...] "strong back" [...] or other solid base. The strips are shaped with bead and cove router bits. Stripping begins at the <b>sheer</b> <b>line</b> and finishes with [...] "the football". The strips are edge-glued to each other, being held in place with nails, staples, or simply clamped to the forms. Once the strips are glued together, and the staples/nails removed, the inside and outside are sanded fair. Fiberglass and epoxy is applied to the canoe inside and out. The fiberglass covering is transparent, waterproof, and allowing the wood strips to be seen. The strips are usually cedar, but can be any type of wood. Contrasting woods are sometimes used as accent strips. The last steps in construction is to install the seats, thwarts, and gunwales. Finally a coat of marine grade polyurethane is applied to protect the wood and epoxy from ultraviolet light.|$|E

5000|$|Originally [...] "composite" [...] {{referred}} to a timber carvel skin fastened to iron frame and deck beams. This allowed sheet copper anti-fouling to be employed without the risk of galvanic corrosion of the hull fabric. It was employed for fast cargo vessels so {{that they were not}} slowed by marine fouling. This use is now obsolete. While GRP, wood, and even concrete hulls are technically made of composite materials, the term [...] "composite" [...] is often used for plastics reinforced with fibers other than (or in addition to) glass. Cold-molded refers to a type of building one-off hulls using thin strips of wood applied to a series of forms at 45-degree angles to the centerline. This method is often called double-diagonal because a minimum of two layers is recommended, each occurring at opposing 45-degree angles. [...] "Cold-molding" [...] is now a relatively archaic term because the contrasting [...] "hot-molded" [...] method of building boats, which used ovens to heat and cure the resin, has not been widely used since World War II [...] Now almost all curing is done at room temperature. Other composite types include sheathed-strip, which uses (usually) a single layer of strips laid up parallel to the <b>sheer</b> <b>line.</b> The composite materials are then applied to the mold {{in the form of a}} thermosetting plastic (usually epoxy, polyester, or vinylester) and some kind of fiber cloth (fiberglass, kevlar, dynel, carbon fiber, etc.), hence the finished hull is a [...] "composite" [...] of fiber and resin.

40|$|The design {{featured}} in this project is a 75 ft Luxury Powerboat built on a production basis. The vessel’s performance criteria was to achieve a maximum speed of 60 knots and to be competitive with leading name brands such as, Sunseeker International, Princess Yachts International, Fairline Boats Plc, Ferretti Yachts and Pershing Yachts, in terms of retail price, but differ in exterior styling from the normal characteristic of a white hull and super structure.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the design is to show the desire of a woman through her {{sexuality}} while also following her belief of modesty. This is {{a woman with a}} lot of creativity and elegance. She wants to show every unique side to her. I wanted to challenge my design abilities by doing a garment I have not done before. Using a slippery fabric and a fitted top, it gave the garment the class, elegance, and sex appeal I desired. The colors show the creative side of her while the flow gives her elegance. Process: Before beginning the sketches for my designs, images were collected for inspiration and design elements. The inspiration was primarily photos of Muslim women, who are often viewed as oppressed, but these photos show the creativity in which they have control over their fashion. To me, this represented strong women who are fun and creative while still being able to practice modesty for their beliefs. In order to show a modest look while giving a little sex appeal, I chose to gather the skirt at the waist using a lot of fabric while keeping a slit up to show the leg while she’s walking. Not only fashions and prints were inspiration but also architecture and colors of the Middle East including mosques as well as Jewish synagogues across Israel and Lebanon. Techniques: Draping and flat patterning methods were used to create this garment. The top of the dress is flat-patterned and then altered to fit the model’s bust. The skirt was solely draped at the waist and cut for each panel, then the front seam was left partially opened up the leg. The materials include 1 -¼ yards of the top skirt sheer organza fabric {{as well as for the}} black <b>sheer</b> <b>lining</b> fabric underneath. There is a half a yard of the top woven fabric used as well as for the neck and armhole facings. Contribution to fashion: A lot of playful colors and lines gives a feminine look to the garments. Architectural and geometric design elements that show strength in the look as well. The flow of the skirt with the high slit shows boldness while the movement gives elegance. Materials: Woven fabric, zipper, interfacing, polyester thread.

40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{the implementation of}} a calibration, format-translation and data conditioning software for radiometric tracking data of deep-space spacecraft. All of the available propagation-media noise rejection techniques available as features in the code are covered in their mathematical formulations, performance and software implementations. Some techniques are retrieved from literature and current state of the art, while other algorithms have been conceived ex novo. All of the three typical deep-space refractive environments (solar plasma, ionosphere, troposphere) are dealt with by employing specific subroutines. Specific attention has been reserved to the GNSS-based tropospheric path delay calibration subroutine, since it is the most bulky module of the software suite, in terms of both the <b>sheer</b> number of <b>lines</b> of code, and development time.

A real-time approach for hatching was presented by Lake et al, 2 which chooses from a set of textures based on the brightness at vertices, subdividing polygons if necessary. However, the method is very CPU-heavy and requires many polygons. Our new technique uses per-pixel shading graphics hardware to implement non-photorealistic shading. The texture-combining facilities accessible via OpenGL on NVIDIA GeForce and ATI Radeon cards provide the flexibility necessary to vary the line width or number of strokes per area. To indicate shading by variable-width hatching, a 3 D halftone pattern is created as texture T and compared at every pixel with the target intensity I, creating black or white pixels. 3 Halftoning, however, yields unsatisfying results for interactive applications because of the computer screen’s limited resolution. To smooth the harsh transition from white to black we instead take the inverted sum of T and I and scale it by some constant c> 1.
