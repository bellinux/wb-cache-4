40|$|The use of Wiener {{filtering}} {{to simultaneously}} reduce all the perturbations at the <b>sound</b> <b>pick-up</b> of hands-free terminals is investigated in this paper. This analysis of perturbation reduction {{is a global}} approach as all types of perturbations to desired signal are reduced by a unique filter. Filters derived from this approach are applied in two different contexts: hands-free radiotelephony in cars, where two distinct perturbations have to be considered, noise and acoustic echo; and the teleconference context where the global approach was performed on residual echo remaining after a classical echo cancellation. The use of psychoacoustic properties is also considered {{in order to improve}} the quality of the transmitte...|$|E

While hiding out at the home of Mattie and her two children, Bowie unwittingly insults Mattie by comparing her with his mother during an exchange that initially <b>sounds</b> like a <b>pick-up.</b> The insult, combined with the lascivious attention of the much older T-Dub toward Mattie's daughter Lula, and Bowie's later return with the young Keechie (now pregnant with Bowie's child) in tow inspires Mattie's revenge against Bowie.|$|R
25|$|Vacuum tubes {{may have}} or develop defects in {{operation}} that make an individual tube unsuitable {{in a given}} device, although it may perform satisfactorily in another application. Microphonics refers to internal vibrations of tube elements which modulate the tube's signal in an undesirable way; <b>sound</b> or vibration <b>pick-up</b> may affect the signals, or even cause uncontrolled howling if a feedback path develops between a microphonic tube and, for example, a loudspeaker. Leakage current between AC heaters and the cathode may couple into the circuit, or electrons emitted directly from {{the ends of the}} heater may also inject hum into the signal. Leakage current due to internal contamination may also inject noise. Some of these effects make tubes unsuitable for small-signal audio use, although unobjectionable for many purposes. Selecting the best of a batch of nominally identical tubes for critical applications can produce better results.|$|R
5000|$|Gibson started {{producing}} the S-1 in mid-1974, but released {{it on the}} market in 1975. Its production lifespan was 1974-1980. Like the Gibson Marauder, the S-1 was an attempt to break through into the single-coil guitar market. It too consisted of a flat Les Paul -like body with a maple Flying V neck bolted on. Unlike the Marauder, however, the S-1 featured three [...] "see-thru" [...] single-coil pickups designed by Bill Lawrence, with fairly elaborate circuitry to generate humbucking and single-coil <b>pick-up</b> <b>sounds.</b> Just like the Marauders, the S-1 all had Schaller made [...] "Harmonica" [...] ("tune-o-matic" [...] style) bridges and the standard Gibson stopbar tailpiece. The S-1 had one 2 way toggle switch and a [...] "chicken head" [...] 4 position rotary switch. This 4 way rotary switch made it possible to use the pick-ups in 4 different ways: 1) neck + middle, 2), middle pick-up + bridge pick-up, 3) all three together, and 4) the neck and bridge out of phase. In the down position the 2 way toggle switch bypassed the entire 4 position rotary switch circuit and made one straight connection to the bridge pick-up, which resulted in a sound that was pretty close to that of the Fender Esquire (Telecaster in bridge only position). The potentiometers are volume and tone. The sound was similar to that of a Fender Stratocaster or a Fender Telecaster.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} Blind Source Separation (BSS) applied to Acoustic Noise Cancellation (ANC) schemes when two microphones are used for the <b>sound</b> <b>pick-up.</b> The proposed approach {{is based on an}} improved Forward BSS structure combined with a postfilter [1] in order to correct the inherent speech distortion brought by the Forward BSS structure. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to the performance of two Backward BSS structures, namely the classical Backward structure [2] and the adaptive solution proposed in [3]. Performances of the proposed algorithm are evaluated by the output SNR and the cepstral distance under various environments. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the classical Backward structure and the adaptive one, especially in the critical case of closely spaced microphones. 1...|$|E
40|$|Microphone arrays offer a {{potential}} {{solution to the}} important problem of obtaining high-quality <b>sound</b> <b>pick-up</b> from remote acoustic sources. Most reported results for microphone array technology have been theoretical, proposed algorithms with predicted performance, or based on ideal or near-ideal simulations of microphonearray systems and room environments. Previous work {{that is based on}} real data has usually been for a small number of microphones. In this paper, for the first time, measured results for a large number of microphones, 256, in a large-aperture, real-time, all DSP system are reported. The array system is mounted in a moderatesized (8 Mx 8 M) room with a significant reverberation time. While listeners to the locationing/tracking/beamforming system claim to hear near-close-talking microphone performance when the system acquires a talker, our measured results of the real-time system indicat...|$|E
40|$|This {{work was}} {{motivated}} by the increasing need for acoustic localization systems. The various localization systems that were implemented during this PhD include localization of snow avalanches, artillery and supersonic aircraft in the infrasound domain, the localization of helicopters, civilian aircraft, speakers and auditorium reflections in the audio domain and the localization of chirps in the underwater ultrasound domain. The "goniometer" is defined as an instrument that measures angles. An "acoustic goniometer" is therefore a system that measures the direction of arrival (DOA) of sounds, and thus estimates the source direction. A goniometer {{is made up of}} an antenna, composed of several sensors arranged in a particular geometry, and a calculation algorithm. The successive implementations were designed around a common framework, based on a two-step spatio-temporal process. The temporal step tackles the problem of the Time Delay Estimation along the antenna baselines, whereas the second step introduces the antenna geometry, in order to estimate the Direction of Arrival per se. The multi-sources case, as well as the outlier's rejection, is assured by a detection module, which uses the temporal and spatial properties of the propagation model. The performances of the TDE and the localization are studied as a function of every relevant parameter, {{in order to determine the}} optimal antenna to run the two-step process. The antenna design rules concern its geometry, its size and its orientation. The results presented in the applications chapter give a realistic idea of the goniometry capacities. Its performances are largely competitive to those of other techniques. Up to now, the goniometry developed during this work, fulfilled all prior requirements. Moreover, the goniometry appeared to be, in many cases, in advance with regards to technological tools such as the <b>sound</b> <b>pick-up,</b> the CPU implementation or installation constraints. The advice that could be given, when tackling a new antenna design, is firstly to visualize both spatial and temporal properties of the propagating waves and of the perturbating phenomena, and secondly to compare them to the goniometer characteristics. This work has demonstrated that the best performances were achieved for the goniometry of a unique stationary compact source generating broadband low pass signals in a homogenous medium without wind and noise, performed with a wide symmetrical broad-side antenna...|$|E
40|$|The Braunmuhl-Weber {{microphone}} design, patented in 1935, {{is often}} used for studio microphones since directionality can be changed electrically. Materials, construction and machining methods have changed little since the patent date. The backplate is drilled, limiting how small each hole can be made. This leads to microphone noise problems through increased acoustic resistance from the remaining surfaces {{and the loss of}} electrode area. Tensioned diaphragms decrease the available compliance and microphone sensitivity. The goal of this work is to develop a new condenser studio microphone that exceeded the performance of the best commercial studio microphones used as benchmarks. Electroacoustic modelling aided the understanding of microphone behaviour and allowed more efficient optimization of microphone performance. Model performance was optimized for sensitivity, self-noise, and directivity (the <b>sound</b> <b>pick-up</b> pattern). Excimer laser micromachining extends the performance of the microphone by forming smaller and denser backplate holes that lower acoustic impedance and microphone self-noise. Direct write lithography allows patterning of the diaphragm electrode for lower parasitic capacitance. The physical format of the microphone would have been impossible to produce using conventional microphone manufacturing methods. By using Mylar® instead of the more traditional brass, it is shown microphone parts can be micromachined less expensively and more easily. Microphone performance was further improved by introducing design changes: the symmetric microphone arrangement, operation of the diaphragm in plate mode and elimination of the backplate blind-holes by careful optimization. Diaphragm compliance and microphone sensitivity increased when external diaphragm tension was removed to allow the diaphragm to behave as a plate. A symmetric microphone design doubles the available capsule capacitance, shunting more preamplifier input-current noise to create a quieter microphone. Symmetrical outerplates also balance the diaphragm electrostatic collapsing force to allow the use of a zero-tension diaphragm. A comparison of measured performance for the laser micromachined prototype and benchmark commercial studio microphones showed the superior sensitivity of the prototype performance, 55 mV/Pa, compared to 18 mV/Pa for benchmark microphones. Measured self-noise and directivity were as good as the studio microphones (Neumann TLM 103) with 7 to 9 dBA SPL equivalent noise referred to input. The prototype performance greatly exceeded that of silicon micromachined microphones. The prototype high frequency response fell short at 15 kHz limited by excessive diaphragm radius. Symmetric microphone outerplates were prone to moisture ingress which was solved using a capsule heater and protective covers. Australian and U. S. patents were granted for the microphone design developed in this work...|$|E
