5|$|The name Masoandrotsiroa (Masoandro) {{was given}} {{to a series of}} {{buildings}} on the Rova grounds. The original Masoandro {{was one of the first}} three residences built by the Rova's founder, Andrianjaka, in the early 17th century, and over time it became the house reserved for occupation by a new sovereign immediately following coronation. This same Masoandro or a restored version of it was still standing on the Rova grounds and occupied by one of Andrianampoinimerina's wives two hundred years later. However, historic sources offer seemingly contradictory or incomplete accounts of the fate of this historic building. A Masoandro was said to have been relocated from the Rova to Ambohimanga by RanavalonaI. Another source states that Masoandro was demolished at the Rova by RanavalonaII and replaced by a house in brick, only to be demolished again by RanavalonaIII. This last sovereign of Madagascar sought to build a new brick palace, also called Masoandro, with four <b>square</b> <b>corner</b> towers and a higher central tower modelled on the French Residence of Antananarivo. Work began in 1893 but was interrupted by war with France in 1895. The brick foundations of this unfinished Masoandro are still visible today. Still another source states that Masoandro was one of three traditional wooden houses still standing at the Rova when Madagascar was colonised by the French, with the implication that the name was applied to distinct buildings at various times.|$|E
25|$|For the 1923 season, Connie Mack {{had moved}} the infield back an {{estimated}} 21feet. This was {{a choice of}} speed over power, as moving the plate back increased left field and right field dimensions by 15feet each. Home runs dropped about 50% {{for the next three}} seasons. The Shibe brothers moved it back to its original position, resulting in field dimensions of 331feet to right field, 334 to left, and 468 to the <b>square</b> <b>corner</b> in center.|$|E
25|$|The old {{palace of}} the 1550s later {{provided}} {{the foundation for}} the present Strömsholm Palace, built in 1669-1674 for Queen Hedvig Eleonora to a design by Nicodemus Tessin the Elder. The palace consists of a central building framed by four <b>square</b> <b>corner</b> towers. On the park side, there is a large, domed central tower. Around 20 estate buildings were erected {{at the same time as}} the palace, and the first stages of a park in the French baroque style were laid out.|$|E

25|$|The carvings were sculpted {{from the}} top {{to the bottom of}} rathas. The {{sculpture}} in the form of reliefs on the walls inside the ratha is of Ardhanariswara. It is also mentioned that this ratha is dedicated to Candesa, and the elephant sculpture placed outside the ratha is considered an unusual location, as a Vahana or a mount of god, while it is normally placed in front of the ratha). In the two storeys above the ground floors (above the cornices) oblong gabled shrines and <b>square</b> <b>corner</b> shrines are seen which are interlinked by a cloister all around the edge. On the west side, which is gabled, carvings seen are of three gates. In the central door the shrine sculpted with a square tower has a finial on top. The uppermost floor is apsidal and has a large kudu with a shrine inside.|$|E
25|$|An oblong marble plaque {{of white}} field with black framing, and {{containing}} an embossed heraldic shield surmounted by a lion crest, is to Christopher Randolph Turnor (1886–1914), {{who was a}} lieutenant in the 10th Royal Hussars, killed near Ypres, Belgium, and buried in Zandvoorde; {{he was the son}} of Algernon and Lady Henrietta Turnor. Above this plaque are two others, both of a black recessed field, surrounded by a raised figured pink and white marble frame incised with flat straight grooves and <b>square</b> <b>corner</b> devices with embossed details. One is dedicated firstly to Elizabeth Turnor (died 1801 aged 27), first wife of Edmund Turnor (1755–1829), and daughter of Philip Bowes Broke (commander of HMS Shannon in the capture of USS Chesapeake); and secondly to Edmund Turnor’s second wife Dorothea (died 1874 aged 77 years). The second is to Edmund Turnor (died 1806 aged 89 years)—who was the father of Edmund Turnor (1755–1829)—and his wife Mary (died 1818 aged 86 years). A further memorial of double dedication is of a white bolection moulding surrounding two raised plaques on a black field; all marble. Both dedications mention Reginald Charles Turnor (1850–1910); the first for his first wife Gabrielle (died 1898 at Cannes), the daughter to Marquis Sampieri, and whose ashes are held behind the memorial; the second for his death as a major of 1st Life Guards, and the husband of Laura Leticia Turnor. Below this double dedication is a plaque to Laura Letitia Turnor (1872–1952).|$|E
500|$|Duff House, Adam's major {{work of the}} 1730s, {{demonstrates}} his accretion {{of local}} and foreign influences, presenting itself as [...] "a medieval castle in baroque dress". Built between 1735 and 1739, Adam acted as contractor and architect to William, Lord Braco. James Gibbs had recently built another house for Lord Braco, but he declined the commission for Duff, recommending Adam for the job. The main facade of Duff House is remarkable for its height, and with the tall corner towers the impression is of a highly vertical house. This style {{is related to the}} designs produced by the exiled Jacobite Earl of Mar, an amateur architect who collaborated with Adam at the House of Dun. Charles McKean compares Duff to the 17th century Drumlanrig Castle, and places it within the Scottish architectural tradition. Like Drumlanrig, and Heriot's Hospital (1620s–1690s) in Edinburgh [...] before it, Duff House has a double-pile block flanked by taller <b>square</b> <b>corner</b> towers. The [...] "baroque dress" [...] at Duff derives from Vanbrugh, and particularly Eastbury Park (1724–38) in Dorset. Designs for pavilions and quadrant wings were never executed due to Lord Braco's dispute with Adam. Braco never occupied or fitted out the house for the same reason.|$|E

The slabs are generally [...] wide and [...] high with a [...] vertical overlap (shiplap) to prevent water from entering the horizontal joints. Twelve such courses, the internal ribs, the marble capstone, and the aluminum apex comprise the pyramidion. Its height is [...] [...] Its weight is [...] The slope of the walls of the pyramidion is 17°24' from the vertical. [...] There are twelve ribs, three per wall, which spring from the [...] level, all being integrated into the walls up to the [...] level. All are free standing above 500 feet, relying on mortise and tenon joints to attach neighboring stones. The eight corner ribs terminate six courses above the shaft, each corner rib resting on its neighboring corner rib via a miter joint, forming four corner arches. Each such arch supports a pair of <b>square</b> <b>corner</b> stones, one above the other totaling one course in height. Each corner rib is linked to the nearest center rib at the sixth course via a marble tie beam. The four center ribs terminate eight courses above the shaft at a marble cruciform (cross shaped) keystone, forming two main arches that cross each other. Two stones, each one course high, are mounted on each of the four ribs, supporting two additional courses above the cruciform keystone, leaving two courses to support the capstone's weight by themselves.|$|E
2500|$|The chapel {{consists}} of a regular, longitudinal plan (sideways [...] "T"), with articulated volumes covered in rounded tile. The principal entrance is the side entryway to the three nave body, which is flanked by <b>square</b> <b>corner</b> pilasters, surmounted by a small bell-tower over the door. To the left, the smaller annex is actually the chapel's altar and retable, slightly recessed from the entrance (the tail of the [...] "T"), while {{to the right of}} this structure, is the Solar dos Pintos; a larger two-story building with massive portico, surmounted by two visible windows. Above the main entrance way to the chapel are three coat of arms, within square granite slabs, and two Romanesque inscriptions (on {{the right side of the}} doorway), while the whole ensemble is decorated with cornices. Access to the chapel is made by four-step staircase on either side of the building.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the stadium}} opened for the 1955 season, Carpenter's first, {{advertising}} billboards {{first appeared on}} the walls and roofs of the outfield: Formost dairy, Goldenberg's Peanut Chews, Philco, Cadillac, Alpo, Coca-Cola and Mertz Tours signs became familiar sights to stadiumgoers and to fans watching on television. A new straight-across fence covered the <b>square</b> <b>corner</b> in center field and most of the remaining [...] "terrace", reducing the distance to a still-formidable 447feet. Distance markers also appeared on the walls for the first time. In addition to the foul poles (334 and 331) and the center field area (447), a 400 marker was posted just to the center field side of the scoreboard, and a 405 marker in the corresponding area of deep left center field. A few years later, wooden fencing covered the rough bricks along the right field wall, and eventually the 331 sign was changed to read 329, although that change had no impact on the actual home run distance.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} 1909 configuration was a double-deck grandstand in {{the southwest}} corner of the block, with open pavilion seating extending to the foul poles. The outfield was a large rectangle, surrounded by a 12-foot brick wall that bordered the streets. The deepest part of center field was a <b>square</b> <b>corner</b> 515feet from home plate. It was 378 to the left field foul marker, and 340 to right field. The slight upslope of the land from south to north was reflected in a small [...] "terrace" [...] that ran across left and center field. [...] The upper deck was built of wood mounted on steel girders, while the lower deck was built of concrete and steel. The only link with the Columbia Park was the transplanted sod, rolled out at the new venue. The 1909 seating capacity certainly was an upgrade from Columbia Park: 11,000 in the double deck and 12,000 in the two pavilions, for a total of 23,000. Overflow crowds were accommodated by roping off the left field area in front of the wall. Some 500 tons of steel went into the construction.|$|E
2500|$|Marchegg [...] lies on {{the border}} of Austria and Slovakia, on the {{historic}} border with Hungary, immediately adjacent to the river March. To-day the modern settlement is much smaller than the very large rectangular area -800x750 metres – the largest medieval planned settlement in Lower Austria, which is covered by fortifications which are clearly demarcated on the ground and in property boundaries. The town offers unrivalled opportunities for archaeological and geophysical survey to show how towns of this period were laid out and fortified. The town was founded by the Bohemian King Ottakar II in 1268, and he established the Castle which is at the NW corner. Following the battle at nearby Durnkrut in 1278, Ottaker was killed and his territories passed to the Habsburg Duke Rudolf. The large rectangular layout of the town is more in keeping with Duke Rudolf’s planned towns than Ottaker’s. Marchegg was intended to secure the Moravian and Hungarian borders and to encourage cross-border trade. Some idea of the fortifications can be gained from Vischer’s print of 1672 showing a walled town with a gateway adjacent to a round tower and another <b>square</b> <b>corner</b> tower. Portions of two gates survive, the Vienertor and Ungartor, lengths of wall, and one round tower.|$|E
