25|$|Emma {{has decided}} to help Elsa search for Anna. The {{necklace}} leads them to the beach, but Anna is not there. Emma explains that magic is not always accurate, and {{that she needs to}} accept that Anna may no longer even be alive. Elsa weeps and wishes that she could know what happened to Anna and that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> again. Suddenly the necklace begins to glow. The necklace is revealed to be the Wishing Star. A trunk appears in the water and Anna and Kristoff emerge as Gerda's message in the bottle for her daughters appears ashore on the beach, but goes unnoticed.|$|E
500|$|After various failed relationships, Lex finally {{believes}} he has what he wants when he begins a romantic relationship with Lana Lang. In [...] "Hypnotic", {{in an effort to}} stop hurting Lana emotionally, Clark told her that he no longer loved her. This drives Lana into Lex's arms. Writer Darren Swimmer explains that this was not something that just happened in the series, but something that had been hinted at for many seasons. Rosenbaum admits that Lex had a crush on Lana for many years, but contends that he tried to help Clark win Lana early on—he succeeded. When Clark and Lana's relationship crumbled, because of Clark's deceit, Lex was waiting. Rosenbaum believes that Lana was [...] "tired of the boy and wanted a man around". By contrast, Swimmer believes that Lana started dating Lex as a way of making Clark mad, but the relationship [...] "turned into much more". Kreuk contends that Lana went to Lex because [...] "she knows she will never really love him." [...] Kreuk believes that Lana's relationship with the men in her life was originally motivated by a desire to fill a void in her life that was left after her parents were killed. This need to fill that emptiness was fulfilled in [...] "Void", when Lana took a drug to induce death so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> parents in the afterlife. Upon meeting her parents, Kreuk believes that Lana realized that she no longer needed someone else to fill that hole in her. Kreuk sees this filled void as the reason why Lana would gravitate toward Lex. Kreuk feels that if Lex had chosen a different path after the events of [...] "Lexmas", then Lana {{would have been able to}} truly love him.|$|E
500|$|The {{beginning}} of season five saw, for the first time, Clark and Lana in a happy relationship together, one that was void of dishonesty and secrets. The return of Clark's powers in [...] "Hidden", {{as well as the}} secrets and lies that accompany them, caused stress on their relationship. In the series' 100th episode, Clark finally took a chance and told Lana the truth. When it resulted, indirectly, in her death and he was allowed to live the day over again Clark chose not to tell her his secret. In [...] "Hypnotic", in an effort to stop hurting Lana emotionally, Clark told her that he no longer loved her. This drove Lana into Lex's arms. Writer Darren Swimmer explains that this was not something that just happened in the series, but something that had been hinted at for many seasons. Swimmer believes that Lana started dating Lex as a way of making Clark mad, but the relationship [...] "turned into much more".

60|$|Adrea was {{the first}} to recover her composure. She was a little further away, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> only <b>her</b> step-mother.|$|R
60|$|Ruth {{felt the}} same. She {{was fond of}} Sybil, but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>her</b> as the fore-ordained Mrs. Bailey.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> {{no longer}} speak. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> <b>her</b> lover, as if transfigured, limned dark against the looming red wall.|$|R
2500|$|Ross {{took his}} wife Mary and the {{children}} to Philadelphia so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> family. Ross returned to Washington, where he had an inconclusive meeting with President Lincoln and other supporters. When he returned for Mary in 1865, he found her gravely ill with what was diagnosed as [...] "lung congestion" [...] (likely tuberculosis). She could not travel, so he remained with her {{for more than a}} month. Mary died of her illness on July 20, 1865. She was buried in her native Delaware. Ross returned to Indian Territory after her funeral.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} morning, Nodder {{was placed}} in an identity parade, {{and each of the}} witnesses who had seen Mona on 5 and 6 January did not hesitate to pick him out as the man they had seen in her company. Confronted with both these positive identifications and the successive pieces of evidence being discovered at his home, Nodder changed his story as to his actions on 5 January. In his initial statement, given on the evening of 8 January, Nodder claimed he had encountered Mona by chance outside her school, and that the child had asked him to take her to visit her aunt (Edith Grimes) in Sheffield in order that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> newborn cousin, whom she had not yet seen. Reluctantly, he had agreed to Mona's request, as he had expected to see Mrs. Grimes the following day (the pair having an agreement to meet once a week in their affair). He had therefore persuaded Mona to spend the evening at his home, before giving the child two shillings and placing her on a bus to Sheffield the following evening, with instructions—both verbal and written—as to how to reach her aunt's home. This arrangement would therefore ensure Nodder's home was empty when Mrs. Grimes visited him at their pre-scheduled meeting time. Nodder further stated Edith Grimes could assist with the case, adding she had known his address but alleging she had withheld this information from the police. (Edith Grimes admitted to police she and Nodder had engaged in an affair, but indignantly denied his other claims and accusations.) ...|$|E
60|$|Florence {{looked at}} her with {{increasing}} fear and wonder, until <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> no more through the blinding tears that ran down her face.|$|E
60|$|Lucy {{walked to}} the window and looked out. But <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> nothing. <b>Her</b> eyes were blurred with tears. She breathed quickly, trying to control herself.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, it's a mirror!" [...] she cried; for <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> all <b>her</b> {{pretty face}} and fluffy, rainbow-tinted gown {{reflected}} in the pool, as natural as life.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>her</b> daughter's face, but {{the white}} figure before her stood silent and irresolute in the darkness. Mrs. Almayer pursued her advantage.|$|R
6000|$|This {{appears to}} be a {{thoroughly}} nice, well-conducted establishment. What would my mother say if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> Rupert in the midst of these reckless youths!" ...|$|E
60|$|Then Una {{began to}} ponder the problem which is so weighty to girls of the city--where <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> lover, since the parks were impolite and her own home obtrusively dull to him.|$|E
60|$|To Lucy this had, at least, the {{advantage}} that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> father alone, {{and at the}} appointed hour {{she made her way}} once more to his flat. He took her in his arms and kissed her warmly. She succumbed at once to the cheeriness of his manner.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>her</b> rescuer, for {{the hall}} {{into which he}} had hastily dragged her was only dimly lighted. But a {{peremptory}} voice said quickly: ...|$|R
6000|$|In the dark, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>her</b> father's frown, but she {{was aware}} of it in his answer. [...] "You went there against my will. Well?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Hilda only nodded. Being {{mounted on}} the mare, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> behind <b>her</b> more {{steadily}} now than I could from the machine; and her eye was trustworthy. As for the baby, rocked by the heave {{and fall of the}} pony's withers, it had fallen asleep placidly in the very midst of this terror! ...|$|R
60|$|After {{hearing the}} door close, Emma lay {{for a few}} minutes listening, waiting until she felt sure Mrs. Harkey was well out of the yard, then she crept out of bed and crawled to the window. Mrs. Jim was far down the road; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> blue dress and her pink sunbonnet.|$|E
60|$|Ethel {{did as she}} was told, {{without much}} {{volition}} of her own; and she quitted the carriage, and was drawn into her place by Norman, trusting that Meta would not let her do wrong, and relieved that {{just in front of}} her were the little ones, over whose heads <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> father, with Flora's veiled bending figure.|$|E
60|$|She rose {{quickly and}} {{went out of the}} room, hurrying along the corridor, with the irresistible impulse to go and see her husband and inquire if she could do {{anything}} for him. Perhaps Mr. Tucker was gone and Mr. Casaubon was alone in the library. She felt as if all her morning's gloom would vanish if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> husband glad because of her presence.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Dixon {{said she}} should not say a word, {{she should not}} care {{if it was not}} for the child, but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>her</b> wronged by her own father, and not complain; poor little dear! she was the last, and she {{supposed}} she should not keep her long.|$|R
60|$|The Belgians left, {{the train}} ran on, through Luxembourg, through Alsace-Lorraine, through Metz. But she was blind, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> no more. <b>Her</b> soul {{did not look}} out.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Aie! That is bad and rude. Go away!' she cried, {{though it}} hurt her {{to raise her}} voice. 'Go away by the road you came!' The child passed behind the bed-foot, where <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>her.</b> 'Shut the door as you go. I will speak to Anna, but--first, put that white thing straight.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'O, {{how is it}} {{that man}} has so fascinated me?' was all she could think. Her own self, as she had sat spell-bound before him, was all <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see.</b> <b>Her</b> gait was constrained, from the {{knowledge}} that his eyes were upon her until she had passed the hollow by the waterfall, and by ascending the rise had become hidden from his view by the boughs of the overhanging trees.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{the way to}} talk," [...] {{said the}} proprietor, cordially. [...] "You try it on. You can't judge a suit, not a real nice suit like this, by looking at it. You {{want to put it}} on. There!" [...] He led the way to a dusty mirror {{at the back of the}} shop. [...] "Isn't that a bargain at seventy dollars?...Why, say, your mother would be proud if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> boy now!" ...|$|E
60|$|Returning to the pass, {{she took}} off the kerchief with which she usually bound up her {{luxuriant}} brown hair, {{and placed it in}} the middle of the track, with her knife lying beside it. Having laid this wicked little trap to her satisfaction, she retired to a knoll close at hand, from which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> kerchief and knife on the one hand and her horse on the other. Then she concealed herself behind the trunk of a tree.|$|E
60|$|Tottie, who {{was greatly}} {{impressed}} with the anxious determination of her mother, and therefore with the heinous nature of her father's intended sin, gave her entire mind to this subject, and, after talking it over, and looking at it in all lights, {{came to the conclusion}} that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>her</b> way out of the difficulty at all.|$|R
60|$|Lawford <b>could</b> <b>see</b> his wife--every tint and {{curve and}} line as {{distinctly}} as <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> him. <b>Her</b> cheeks {{never had much}} colour; now her whole face visibly darkened, from pallor to a dusky leaden grey, as she gazed. It was not an illusion then; not a miserable hallucination. The unbelievable, the inconceivable, had happened. He replaced the candles with trembling fingers and sat down.|$|R
50|$|Roland {{said they}} {{must take the}} witch's magic wand. The stepsister went back to take it, leaving three drops of blood. When, in the morning, the witch called, the drops of blood {{answered}} her, but when <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>her</b> daughter where she heard the voice, {{she went into the}} bedroom and saw her dead daughter. Raging, she set out after them in seven league boots.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Forel turned so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> companion. [...] "That is {{not what}} I mean, and I think I had better talk quite {{straight}} to you. Now I like Mr. Seaforth and Mr. Alton, too, and as Jack is mixed up in some business of theirs {{and they are going}} to stay down in Vancouver we shall probably see a good deal of them. Jack, however, is sometimes a little hasty in making friends, and I want to know the other reason that brought Mr. Seaforth out from the old country." ...|$|E
6000|$|Across the field, {{in another}} patch of corn, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> father-a big, gruff-voiced, wide-bearded Norwegian-at work {{also with a}} plow. The corn must be plowed, and so she toiled on, the tears {{dropping}} from {{the shadow of the}} ugly sunbonnet she wore. Her shoes, coarse and square-toed, chafed her feet; her hands, large and strong, were browned, or more properly burned, on the backs by the sun. The horse's harness [...] "creak-cracked" [...] as he swung steadily and patientiy forward, the moisture pouring from his sides, his nostrils distended.|$|E
60|$|But old Granny Fox didn't know this. She never {{makes such}} {{mistakes}} herself. Oh, my, no! So now, {{as she came}} up over the hill {{to a place where}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>her</b> home, she laid the chicken down and then she crept behind a little bush and looked all over the Green Meadows to see if the way was clear. She knew that Bowser the Hound was chained up. She had seen Farmer Brown and Farmer Brown's boy hoeing in the cornfield, so she had nothing to fear from them.|$|E
60|$|She sighed {{a sigh of}} deep, of passionate regret and longing. If <b>she</b> <b>could</b> only <b>see</b> <b>her</b> husband; if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{only look}} for one second into those laughing, lazy eyes, wherein she alone knew how to fathom the {{infinity}} of passion that lay within their depths; if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> but once feel his--ardent kiss on her lips, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> more easily endure this agonising suspense, and wait confidently and courageously for the issue.|$|R
50|$|Rokka is a {{five year}} old witch {{who has the}} ability to use {{transformation}} magic, allowing her to turn into whatever she pleases. Rokka is madly in love with Ichi, and followed him into the human world to enter the magic exams, so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> him. <b>Her</b> partner for the exams is Go, who is also her butler. She often transforms into an older female in an attempt to seduce Ichi, but to no avail.|$|R
6000|$|... "Every day is an {{uncommon}} day now," [...] she said jubilantly to herself--for did not {{almost every day}} bring her a glimpse of Sylvia? Even on rainy days the Old Lady gallantly braved rheumatism to hide behind her clump of dripping spruces and watch Sylvia pass. The only days <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>see</b> <b>her</b> were Sundays; and no Sundays had ever seemed so long to Old Lady Lloyd as those June Sundays did.|$|R
