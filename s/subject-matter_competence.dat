50|$|In {{order to}} invite {{qualified}} applicants {{who do not}} yet hold teaching credential to work with High Tech High, the organization developed its own credential program in 2004, becoming the state’s first approved charter-management organization (CMO) to do so. Educators who wish to work with High Tech High may earn a teaching credential through the Teacher Intern Program. Those who possess (at a minimum) B.A. or B.S. upon hiring and demonstrate <b>subject-matter</b> <b>competence</b> may apply for employment {{under the condition that}} they will enroll concurrently in a credential and induction program. The credential program is accredited by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing, is recognized for resisting the theoretical approach many credential programs are criticized for, and adopting a clinical approach, akin to a medical residency. It authorizes Single-Subject, Multiple Subjects and Education Specialist credentials for staff and non-HTH teachers. Most interns teach full-time while earning their credentials, earning a regular salary and benefits. Graduates of the program present a portfolio of their work, demonstrating that they have met the qualifications to be licensed as a teacher in the state of California.|$|E

The methodological framework of the report is based on an analysis of literature and selected documents covering the debate held and the policy adopted in Austria regarding the definition and selection of competencies, and on a small number of specific interviews with experts representing interest groups and the school administration. The most noteworthy activities found in Austria were two long-term measures: The development of a new curriculum for the secondary lower level (1999 curriculum), which introduced a new mandatory competency notion {{in the sense of a}} complementarity between <b>subject-matter</b> <b>competence</b> and self-competence/social competence for this phase of compulsory schooling. Industry as well launched a process of several years that was designed to define the challenges and new requirements facing the system of education and submitted extensive suggestions for the definition of competencies needed, which are aimed at complementing <b>subject-matter</b> <b>competence</b> by methodological and social competence. ...|$|E
40|$|Psychological {{theories}} that describe {{the development of}} <b>subject-matter</b> <b>competence</b> in terms {{of changes in the}} quality of cognition provide a basis for reconsidering the design and evaluation of alternative assessments. Such an evaluation explicitly considers the thinking and reasoning activities elicited in assessment situations {{and the extent to which}} these activities are given preference in defining subject-matter achievement. This paper describes an approach to address this cognitive validity issue that utilizes comparative studies of expertise. Illustrative examples from cognitive analyses of current assessment practices make apparent the utility of this approach for identifying performance objectives and examining the correspondence among test objectives, performance scores, and observed cognitive activity. This approach calls for the integration of assessment practice and knowledge of learning, and challenges the measurement community to (a) reconceptualize achievement test theory and design to systematically incorporate the cognitive aspects of performance, and (b) formulate appropriate methodologies for analyzing the cognitive properties o...|$|E
40|$|Recent research, both internationally {{and within}} Norway, has clearly {{expressed}} concerns about missing connections between <b>subject-matter</b> knowledge, pedagogical <b>competence</b> and real life practice in schools. This study looks at this problem within {{the domain of}} field practice in teacher education, specifically studying pre-service teachers’ planning, teaching and reflection on a physics lesson. The aim was to change the field practice experience, {{so that it would}} contribute to the pre-service teachers’ professional development in a better way than what is typically experienced, by specifically combining <b>subject-matter</b> knowledge, pedagogical <b>competence</b> and real life practice. To approach this challenge, a two-year time lagged design experiment was conducted. During the first year (2012), a control group situation was studied. During this year, groups of pre-service teachers were followed as they worked together with their assigned mentor teachers during field practice. These groups prepared and conducted field practice as described in the National Curriculum Regulations. During the second year (2013), an intervention was studied. Similar to the first year, groups of pre-service teachers and their mentors were followed during field practice. However, during this second year, an intervention was introduced consisting of two components. The first was Lesson Study, which is a method for planning, carrying out and reflecting on a research lesson in detail with a learner- and content-centred focus. Lesson Study was used in combination with a second component, Content Representations, which is a systematic tool connecting overall teaching aims with pedagogical prompts. The above data collection was guided by and conducted {{as part of a larger}} project called Teachers as Students (TasS). The data was collected through video-recordings of two cycles of planning, conducting, and reflection on a field practice lesson. This way of approaching the research question allowed for a comparison of differences between the two conditions. The difference was assessed using the construct Pedagogical Content Knowledge. This was chosen because someone with well-developed Pedagogical Content Knowledge has a rather deep understanding of the connections between <b>subject-matter</b> knowledge, pedagogical <b>competence,</b> and practice. Furthermore, many current researchers consider Pedagogical Content Knowledge as the developmental objective of the expert teacher. The main research question that guided the investigation was formulated as follows: “How does the use of Lesson Study combined with Content Representation affect pre-service physics teachers’ potential to start developing Pedagogical Content Knowledge during field practice in teacher education?” This main question was examined from different angles that resulted in four articles. The first two articles focus on describing the differences between the control situation and the intervention. The first article looks into the pre-service teachers’ planning of the first research lesson, while the second article looks into the pre-service teachers’ reflections after the first research lesson has been taught. The first two articles present results that show that the pre-service teachers’ focus when planning and reflecting differs in specific ways when comparing the control situation with that of the intervention. Specifically, during the intervention the pre-service teachers had a much greater focus on the pupils and their learning, together with a much greater focus on assessment. These two important findings were subsequently used to delve more deeply into the reasoning and arguments behind these changes. For this reason, the third and fourth articles only present findings from the intervention. Article three specifically addresses the question of how the pre-service teachers plan, conduct and reflect on the teaching of a specific learning aim. Article four addresses how the pre-service teachers planned, conducted and reflected on the assessment of the learning aim that was researched in article three. Both articles three and four present findings that support the findings presented in articles one and two. However, they also nuance these findings by arguing that the results indicate that the pre-service teachers’ understanding of teaching a learning aim and assessment may be superficial and lacking strong connections. Through discussions of the findings from the four articles, the conclusion is that the use of Lesson Study combined with Content Representation may possibly affect pre-service physics teachers’ potential to start developing Pedagogical Content Knowledge during field practice in teacher education. This conclusion is partly based on research results that indicate that this combination, in a better way than what is typically found, may help pre-service teachers to combine theory and practice. However, the results also questioned the depth of the pre-service teachers’ expressed knowledge during the intervention. This indicates that the Lesson Study and Content Representation approach during field practice might not influence the pre-service teachers’ Pedagogical Content Knowledge as deeply as hoped for...|$|R
