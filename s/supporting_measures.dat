40|$|Abstract. Graph <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> are {{functions}} measuring how fre-quently a given subgraph pattern {{occurs in}} a given database graph. An important class of <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> relies on overlap graphs. A major advantage of the overlap graph based approaches is that they combine anti-monotonicity with counting occurrences of a pattern which are in-dependent according to certain criteria. However, existing overlap graph based <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> are expensive to compute. In this paper, we propose a new <b>support</b> <b>measure</b> {{which is based on}} a new notion of independence.

40|$|In recent years, the {{popularity}} of graph databases has grown rapidly. This paper focuses on single-graph as an effective model to represent information and its related graph mining techniques. In frequent pattern mining in a single-graph setting, {{there are two main}} problems: <b>support</b> <b>measure</b> and search scheme. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for constructing <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> that brings together existing minimum-image-based and overlap-graph-based <b>support</b> <b>measures.</b> Our framework is built on the concept of occurrence / instance hypergraphs. Based on that, we present two new support measures: minimum instance (MI) measure and minimum vertex cover (MVC) measure, that combine the advantages of existing measures. In particular, we show that the existing minimum-image-based <b>support</b> <b>measure</b> is an upper bound of the MI measure, which is also linear-time computable and results in counts that are close to number of instances of a pattern. Although the MVC measure is NP-hard, it can be approximated to a constant factor in polynomial time. We also provide polynomial-time relaxations for both measures and bounding theorems for all presented <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> in the hypergraph setting. We further show that the hypergraph-based framework can unify all <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> studied in this paper. This framework is also flexible in that more variants of <b>support</b> <b>measures</b> can be defined and profiled in it...|$|R

Australia later joined the coalition, donating US $1.5 million to the effort. The program aims to take place over six years, <b>supporting</b> <b>measures</b> that reduce Kiribati's vulnerability to the effects of climate change and sea level rise by raising awareness of climate change, assessing and protecting available water resources, and managing inundation. At the start of the Adaptation Program, representatives from each of the inhabited atolls identified key climatic changes that had taken place over the past 20–40 years and proposed coping mechanisms to deal with these changes under four categories of urgency of need. The program is now focusing on the country's most vulnerable sectors in the most highly populated areas. Initiatives include improving water supply management in and around Tarawa; coastal management protection measures such as mangrove re-plantation and protection of public infrastructure; strengthening laws to reduce coastal erosion; and population settlement planning to reduce personal risks.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} support {{is central to}} data mining. While the {{definition}} of support in transaction databases is intuitive and simple, {{that is not the}} case in graph datasets and databases.

This study examines the requirements for admissibility of a <b>support</b> <b>measure.</b> <b>Support</b> <b>measure</b> for mining graphs are usually based on the notion of an instance graph-a graph representing all the instances of the pattern in a database and their intersection properties. Necessary and sufficient conditions for <b>support</b> <b>measure</b> admissibility, based on operations on instance graphs, are developed and proved.
