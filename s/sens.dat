5|$|For {{the winter}} of 356/7, he chose Senones (<b>Sens)</b> near Paris as his own {{wintering}} base, but quartered most of his troops in other towns, including the main body at Reims under Marcellus, to spread the burden. A large band of Alamanni heard of his reduced escort, however, and besieged him at <b>Sens.</b> Julian's forces were able to hold out until, after a month, the Germans withdrew. He was so outnumbered by the enemy, however, that {{he was unable to}} sally forth and give chase. During the siege, Marcellus had failed to come to his assistance. For this omission, denounced as cowardice by Ammianus, Marcellus was dismissed as magister equitum by Constantius and replaced by Severus, a distinguished officer who was more compatible with Julian.|$|E
5|$|The Robertians were Frankish noblemen owing fealty to the Carolingians, and {{ancestors}} of the subsequent Capetian dynasty.

This was {{despite the fact that}} the film had already been approved by the board's French-language committee, and it was not eventually released until Brault personally released it in 1974.|$|E

5|$|The Last Judgement was an {{especially}} appropriate subject for setting a relic from the Crown of Thorns.

25|$|While some fields {{mentioned}} as branches of <b>SENS</b> are broadly {{supported by the}} medical research community, e.g., stem cell research (RepleniSENS), anti-Alzheimers research (AmyloSENS) and oncogenomics (OncoSENS), the <b>SENS</b> programme {{as a whole has}} been a highly controversial proposal, with many critics arguing that the <b>SENS</b> agenda is fanciful and the highly complicated biomedical phenomena involved in the aging process contain too many unknowns for <b>SENS</b> to be fully implementable in the foreseeable future. Cancer may well deserve special attention as an aging-associated disease (OncoSENS), but the <b>SENS</b> claim that nuclear DNA damage only matters for aging because of cancer has been challenged in the literature as well as by material in the article DNA damage theory of aging.|$|E
