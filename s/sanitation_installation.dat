40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} and quantify, through mathematical models, the production factors of grow-finishing (GF) phases that influence the daily feed intake (DFI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) in pigs. Sixty-five GF farms were evaluated between 2010 and 2013, linked to a cooperative system located in the western Parana State, Brazil, representing 463 batches, with a mean of 642. 79 ± 363. 29 animals per batch, equalling approximately 300, 000 animals. Forty production factors were considered that related to management, <b>sanitation,</b> <b>installations</b> and equipment, nutrition, genetics and environment on the farms. The DFI was influenced by the barn's position relative to the sun (P = 0. 048), initial body weight (P < 0. 0001) and final body weight (P < 0. 0001). It was observed that the FCR was influenced by the barn’s position relative to the sun (P = 0. 0001), the use of humidifiers/misting (P = 0. 03), the presence of composters (P = 0. 006), trees on the sides of barns (P < 0. 045), the initial body weight of the pigs (P < 0. 0001) and duration of the grow-finishing phase (P < 0. 0001). The variables selected in the models explained approximately 44 and 20 % of the total variance in the DFI and FCR, respectively, demonstrating that this resource is a good tool for interpreting the factors related to the parameters evaluated...|$|R

40|$|South African {{national}} policy states {{that all people}} are entitled to free basic water supply and basic, dignified and sustainable <b>sanitation.</b> The <b>installation</b> of Urine Diversion (UD) toilets by eThekwini Municipality in certain rural areas in the greater Durban region is being employed to address this policy where neither waterborne sewerage nor on-site sanitation by ventilated improved pit laterines (VIPs) is feasible. The toilets {{are based on the}} EcoSan “sanitise and reuse ” system, but are presently being used as a sanitation technology only without the reuse of stabilised human waste in agriculture. The design has been adapted to make UD as safe and sustainable as possible under local conditions. This has entailed construction of double vault toilets in which one vault is filled first and the contents are left to stand undisturbed while the second vault fills. Thereafter, the contents of the first vault are removed and buried. The greatest potential risks of UD toilet operation and maintenace are associated with the removal and disposal of the solid material from the toilet vault. Among these, exposure to viable ova of the helminthic parasite, Ascaris lumbricoides, is thought to represent the greatest single hazard. It is not possible t...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{increase}} knowledge of how to provide service in municipal housing companies in Sweden, and of various organisational models for the customer-centric organisation. The principal issue of the study is how housing companies can organise their resources in order to create an efficient and customer-centric organisation. The term customer-centric organisation comprises customer service, letting, and local administration. Customer service is often designated as the housing company’s fault reporting service and includes, for instance, the reporting of faults in dwellings, noise problems, complaints etc. Letting incorporates processes connected with estate agency, marketing, taking possession and vacating, internal exchanges, housing strategies, options, and tenant selection. Local administration incorporates processes connected with day-to-day operational administration, i. e. the provision of service with regard to remedying faults and making repairs. The study’s theoretical points of departure have their basis in research into public housing and the field of service management. The empirical supportive data used in the study is a two-year case study of rganisational changes at Malmö municipal housing company, MKB Fastighets AB (MKB), and a supplementary interview study at four other municipal housing companies. The case study was conducted with the help of observations gleaned from MKB’s internal evaluation group, interviews with management and frontline staff, and a questionnaire survey of frontline staff in MKB’s customer-centric organisation. The supplementary study included interviews with both frontline staff and management. MKB’s organisational change can be divided up into two different phases: the test organisation and the team organisation. The departure point of both organisations was area-based customer service, letting, and local administration. The test organisation entailed MKB creating one single function to manage all these activities. Due to higher administration costs, less visible local administration, and recruitment problems, the test organisation was abandoned. In its place, the team organisation was created, which in many respects consisted of the same concept, but differed in that the area-based customer service, letting, and local administration were shared between several people in a joint local work-team. MKB’s new ways of organising its customer-centric organisation are defined in the study as a holistic model, entailing that all contact with customers was self-managed from a local area office. The results show that the team organisation cultivates a proximity to the customers, also improving customer responsibility and collaboration between frontline staff. It can also be pointed out that the customer-centric organisation needs to be developed further. Among other things, the expertise of frontline staff can be further adapted in order to meet customer requirements. At the same time, it is of great importance to the outcome of the organisational change that the organisation’s overarching parts are coordinated in a manner facilitating the work of frontline staff in the provision of service. The same will apply if the housing company uses contractors in, for instance, property maintenance, grounds management, and heating, ventilation and <b>sanitation</b> <b>installations.</b> If the housing company’s aim is to become customer-oriented, then joint resources will have to be concentrated on the customer process and this process will have to take centre stage in the company’s strategic management decisions.
