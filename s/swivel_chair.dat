500|$|Emeco's {{chairs are}} {{manufactured}} by hand in Hanover, Pennsylvania through a two-week, 77-step process. Eames Demetrios, {{the grandson of}} designer Charles Eames, published a documentary film on the manufacturing process called [...] "77 Steps." [...] Many believe the chair is cast from a single form, but it is actually welded together from 12 pieces. Sheets of aluminum are rolled into tubes, cut to length, and bent into shapes on large hydraulic machines. Various notches and punchouts are made so pieces can fit together before welding. Workers grind down the welding joints {{to give it a}} smooth finish, creating the appearance of being cast from a single piece. The chair goes through a repeated heating and cooling cycle that increases the strength of the aluminum. The chairs are also anodized. Originally <b>swivel</b> <b>chair</b> bases and other parts were purchased from a supplier, but in the 1950s, Emeco began purchasing manufacturing equipment to manufacture them in-house.|$|E
50|$|<b>Swivel</b> <b>chairs</b> {{may have}} wheels {{on the base}} {{allowing}} the user to move the chair around their work area without getting up. This type is common in modern offices and are often {{also referred to as}} office <b>chairs.</b> Office <b>swivel</b> <b>chairs,</b> like computer chairs, usually incorporate a gas lift to adjust the height of the seat, but not usually large (e.g. recliner) swivelling armchairs.|$|R

500|$|Poniewozik {{describes}} the season 1 Meyer as a [...] "bumbling and overwhelmed" [...] shadow {{of her former}} self. Merissa Marr of The Wall Street Journal describes Meyer as [...] "inept". James Parker of The New York Times describes her as animated, powerless, prone to fits, and at times distracted. He notes that she motorcades and entourages with importance, but also passes time rotating dreamily in her <b>swivel</b> <b>chair.</b> Parker opines that Meyer [...] "swears her head off" [...] {{because that is what}} the modern [...] "gaffe-phobic, linguistically constipated" [...] public servant who has sold his/her soul to a lobbyist group does behind closed doors after public speeches about [...] "ceaseless, toneless platitudes". Variety television critic Brian Lowry describes Meyer as [...] "easily flustered, foul-mouthed", saying that her [...] "over-reliance on profanity" [...] is a comedic crutch. David Renshaw of The Guardian describes Meyer as [...] "a perfect combination of ineptness and amorality".|$|E
2500|$|A swivel or {{revolving}} {{chair is}} {{a chair with}} a single central leg that allows the seat to spin around. Swivel chairs can have wheels on the base allowing the user to glide the chair around their work area without getting up. This type of chair is common in modern offices and is often {{also referred to as}} an office chair. Using an English-style Windsor chair which was possibly made and purchased from Francis Trumble or Philadelphia cabinet-maker Benjamin Randolph, Thomas Jefferson invented the <b>swivel</b> <b>chair</b> in 1776. Jefferson heavily modified the Windsor chair and incorporated top and bottom parts connected by a central iron spindle, enabling the top half known as the seat, to swivel on casters of the type used in rope-hung windows. When the Second Continental Congress convened in Philadelphia, Jefferson's <b>swivel</b> <b>chair</b> is purported to be where he drafted the United States Declaration of Independence. Jefferson later had the <b>swivel</b> <b>chair</b> sent to his Virginia plantation, Monticello, where he later built a [...] "writing paddle" [...] onto its side in 1791. Since 1836, the chair has been in the possession of the American Philosophical Society located in Philadelphia.|$|E
2500|$|Jefferson invented {{many small}} {{practical}} devices and improved contemporary inventions, including a revolving book-stand and a [...] "Great Clock" [...] {{powered by the}} gravitational pull on cannonballs. He improved the pedometer, the polygraph (a device for duplicating writing), and the moldboard plow, an idea he never patented and gave to posterity. Jefferson can also be credited as {{the creator of the}} <b>swivel</b> <b>chair,</b> the first of which he created and used to write much of the Declaration of Independence.|$|E

40|$|To {{study the}} extent to which {{environment}} affects or controls learning and communication, an exploratory case study examined the effects of a "novel " classroom environment on student and teacher interaction within the classroom. Freshman students in a traditional expository writing and speaking course at a large midwestern university met in a computer lab where they sat in office-style <b>swivel</b> <b>chairs,</b> each at a terminal. Classroom observations revealed a number of problems which included: (1) the terminals prevented interaction across tables; (2) the terminals presented obstacles during speeches [...] speakers had to "skip " over the computer to have eye contact; (3) the view of the instructor was hindered; and (4) the office-style <b>swivel</b> <b>chairs</b> made a distracting, squeaking noise. A survey which was administered to all 16 students pr-ssent during the last observation revealed the majority (947.) foun...|$|R

50|$|The futuristic {{operations}} room {{was designed by}} {{a team led by}} the interface designer Gui Bonsiepe.

This consisted of slides.|$|R
