40|$|The {{continuing}} {{increase in}} the prevalence of obesity and metabolic disorders such as type-II diabetes and an accelerating aging population globally will remain the major contributors to cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in the 21 st century. It {{is well known that}} aging is highly associated with metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Growing evidence also shows that obesity and metabolic diseases accelerate aging process. Studies in experimental animal models demonstrate similarity of metabolic and cardiovascular phenotypes in metabolic diseases and old age, e. g. insulin resistance, oxidative stress, chronic low grade inflammation, cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, and heart failure, as well as vascular dysfunctions. Despite intensive research, the molecular mechanisms linking metabolic <b>stress,</b> <b>aging,</b> and ultimately cardiovascular diseases are still elusive. Although the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling is a well known regulator of metabolism and lifespan in model organisms, its central role in linking metabolic <b>stress,</b> <b>aging</b> and cardiovascular diseases is recently emerging.

This phenomenon has been commonly referred to as the fatigue and aging "knee". The onset of the knee {{has been found to be}} highly variable and is sensitive to the polymer buffer coating.

On the other hand, the diffusion of large molecules through the polymer coatings can take anywhere from weeks to years to reach the polymer Iglass interface. The implication of this result is that large molecule diffusion might be the rate-determining step in aging. In the work presented here the diffusion of moisture and pH buffer solutions through various optical fiber coatings will be discussed.

40|$|The use of NiTi wires, {{one of the}} Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) {{materials}} that permits efficient damping in stayed cables for bridges, requires an appropriate behavior when exposed to the external temperature effects. The Clausius-Clapeyron thermodynamic equation establishes a shift of the hysteretic cycle in the stress-temperature representation of about 6 MPa/K for the used wires of diameter 2. 46 mm. Hence, an adequate experimental study is necessary to characterize the temperature effects in working conditions. The conducted analysis is twofold. First, the practical evolution of the hysteresis cycle is investigated. The {{results suggest that the}} wire permits a completely satisfactory use for temperatures as low as 253 K (i. e., - 20 oC).

The reversed stress {{imposed on the}} specimen durirlg aging is called here the aging stress. Reloading tests in the forward and reverse direc-tions are carried out at room temperature, and the critical aging stress at which the yield stresses in the two reloading directions become equal is determined {{as a function of}} aging temperature and prestrain. The critical aging stress normalized by the prestress decreases with increasing aging temperature and then becomes constant at aging temperatures above l 00 ℃. The aging index, i. e., the ratio of yield sfress to prestress, rises with increasing aging temperature and approaches a saturation value at 15 O℃. When the specimens are aged at 150 ℃, the critical aging stress normalized by the prestress remains essentially constant independent of the amount of prestrain. Although the aging index is greriter in the stress-aged steel than in the stress-relief annealed steel, the anisotropic yield surfaces of the two steels have similar forms.

These immune cells were shown to actively remodel neuronal circuits, leading to propose new pathogenic mechanisms. To study microglial implication in the loss of synapses, the best pathological correlate of cognitive decline across chronic <b>stress,</b> <b>aging,</b> and diseases, we recently conducted ultrastructural analyses. Our work uncovered the existence of a new microglial phenotype that is rarely present under steady state conditions, in hippocampus, cerebral cortex, amygdala, and hypothalamus, but becomes abundant during chronic <b>stress,</b> <b>aging,</b> fractalkine signaling deficiency (CX 3 CR 1 knockout mice), and Alzheimer's disease pathology (APP-PS 1 mice). Even though these cells display ultrastructural features of microglia, they are strikingly distinct from the other phenotypes described so far at the ultrastructural level. They exhibit several signs of oxidative stress, including a condensed, electron-dense cytoplasm and nucleoplasm making them as "dark" as mitochondria, accompanied by a pronounced remodeling of their nuclear chromatin. Dark microglia appear to be much more active than the normal microglia, reaching for synaptic clefts, while extensively encircling axon terminals and dendritic spines with their highly ramified and thin processes. They stain for the myeloid cell markers IBA 1 and GFP (in CX 3 CR 1 -GFP mice), and strongly express CD 11 b and microglia-specific 4 D 4 in their processes encircling synaptic elements, and TREM 2 when they associate with amyloid plaques. Overall, these findings suggest that dark microglia, a new phenotype that we identified based on their unique properties, could {{play a significant role in}} the pathological remodeling of neuronal circuits, especially at synapses.
