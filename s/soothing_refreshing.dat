50|$|Iwonicz-Zdroj {{is one of}} Poland’s oldest health {{resorts and}} spas, dating back to 1578, which was famous outside Poland already in the 18th century. The town lies in the {{south-eastern}} part of Podkarpackie voivodship, Krosno province. The town is surrounded on all sides by high mixed forest. It lies at 400 m above sea level. This unusual location among hills of Beskid Niski, in the valley of Iwonicki Potok (Iwonicz Stream), undeniably rates Iwonicz highly among those places, which charm guests with their beauty and still immaculately clean air. The resort is {{at a distance of}} 80 km to the south from the voivodship capital - Rzeszów, and 16 km from Krosno. It is about 180 km away from Kraków. The Iwonicz climate is described as foothills climate with properties of sub-alpine climate, what is important and advantageous in health resort treatment. The Iwonicz forests create a microclimate around the resort, regulating humidity and temperature of the air, protecting it from winds and are a source of ozone. The resort is situated {{in the area of the}} greatest insolation and lowest cloudiness in Poland, which, all-in-all makes it a perfect spot for <b>soothing,</b> <b>refreshing</b> and regenerating the body.|$|E
50|$|It {{is taken}} as a Bhutanese {{traditional}} medicine, providing a <b>soothing</b> and <b>refreshing</b> sensation and is believed to improve {{the conditions of the}} heart, liver, and the digestive system as well as calming the nerves.|$|R
50|$|For the photoshoot this week, {{the girls}} had to pose {{underwater}} for a Firefly Tonics commercial whilst trying to deliver a tranquil, <b>soothing</b> and <b>refreshing</b> picture. Lucy had trouble with deep water and had panic problems throughout the shoot. Stefanie was genuinely afraid until she got under the water and started posing like she didn't have a problem.|$|R
60|$|<b>Soothed,</b> calmed, and <b>refreshed,</b> {{he writes}} 'Don Juan,' {{which the world}} is at this late hour {{informed}} was a poem with a high moral purpose, {{designed to be a}} practical illustration of the doctrine of total depravity among young gentlemen in high life.|$|R
50|$|Regardless of {{religious}} persuasion, it is a pleasant and interesting setting {{to spend some}} time for reflection and tranquility, purely from a historical point of view. Despite the abundance of activities other than spiritual retreat, Mary Mackillop Place is in fact a <b>soothing</b> resort which <b>refreshes</b> anyone with its divine calmness.|$|R
60|$|Many {{hopes were}} fixed on John's return; {{but this was}} deferred,--he {{was in the midst}} of church building, and {{establishing}} schemes to which absence would be fatal, and he could only promise to come home next year, when things should be put in train. To his sister he wrote a letter so full of warm affectionate gratitude for her exertions in his behalf, that she was positively <b>soothed</b> and <b>refreshed,</b> and reckoned the more on beginning with him the fraternal union so long delayed, but to which she looked as the solace of her future life.|$|R
60|$|Nothing did, however, happen; she met no one {{whom she}} knew, the psalms were not {{particularly}} appropriate, and her attention wandered {{away to the}} scene at home. She did not come back, as {{she was sure she}} ought to have done, <b>soothed,</b> exhilarated, and <b>refreshed,</b> but rather in a rasped state of mind, and a conscience making a vehement struggle to believe itself in the right--a matter in which she thoroughly succeeded.|$|R
60|$|Before another {{quarter of}} an hour had passed, they were driving through the deep lanes, the long grass thickly laden with morning dew, which beaded the webs of the spiders and rose in clouds of mist under the {{influence}} of the sun's rays. There was stillness in the air at first, then the morning sounds, the labourer going forth, the world wakening to life, the opening houses, the children coming out to school. In spite of the tumult of feeling, Norman could not but be <b>soothed</b> and <b>refreshed</b> by the new and fair morning scene, and both minds quitted the school politics, as Dr. May talked of past enjoyment of walks or drives home in early dawn, the more delicious after a sad watch in a sick-room, and told of the fair sights he had seen at such unwonted hours.|$|R
60|$|The {{sight of}} this tree {{reminded}} us that we had reached a strange land to us. As we sailed under this canopy of leaves we saw the sky through its chinks, and, as it were, the meaning and idea of the tree stamped in a thousand hieroglyphics on the heavens. The universe is so aptly fitted to our organization that the eye wanders and reposes at the same time. On every side {{there is something to}} <b>soothe</b> and <b>refresh</b> this sense. Look up at the tree-tops and see how finely Nature finishes off her work there. See how the pines spire without end higher and higher, and make a graceful fringe to the earth. And who shall count the finer cobwebs that soar and float away from their utmost tops, and the myriad insects that dodge between them. Leaves are of more various forms than the alphabets of all languages put together; of the oaks alone there are hardly two alike, and each expresses its own character.|$|R
60|$|At {{that moment}} {{the sound of a}} Christmas carol came faintly on his ear. It was one of those tunes which, when the village choir were the only musicians he knew, he had thought, unrivalled; and now, even to his tutored, {{delicate}} ear, softened as it was by distance, and endeared by association, it was full of <b>refreshing,</b> <b>soothing</b> harmony. He undrew the curtain, opened the shutter, and looked into the court, where he saw some figures standing. As soon as the light shone from the window, the carol was resumed, and the familiar tones were louder and harsher, but he loved them, with all their rudeness and dissonance, and throwing up the window, called the singers by name, asking why they stood out in the snow, instead of coming into the hall, as usual.|$|R
60|$|The girl's captor narrated {{once more}} {{the story of her}} capture. He stated facts just as they had occurred, without embellishment, his voice as expressionless as his face, and his story was {{received}} in the same manner that it was delivered. The creatures seemed totally lacking in emotion, or, at least, the capacity to express it. It was impossible to judge what impression the story made upon them, or even if they heard it. Their protruding eyes simply stared and occasionally the muscles of their mouths opened and closed. Familiarity did not lessen the horror the girl felt for them. The more she saw of them the more repulsive they seemed. Often her body was shaken by convulsive shudders as she looked at the kaldanes, but when her eyes wandered to the beautiful bodies and she could for a moment expunge the heads from her consciousness the effect was <b>soothing</b> and <b>refreshing,</b> though when the bodies lay, headless, upon the floor they were quite as shocking as the heads mounted on bodies. But by far the most grewsome and uncanny sight of all was that of the heads crawling about upon their spider legs. If one of these should approach and touch her Tara of Helium was positive that she should scream, while should one attempt to crawl up her person--ugh! the very idea induced a feeling of faintness.|$|R
5000|$|Historian of {{technology}} Rachel Maines, {{in her book}} The Technology of Orgasm, {{has argued that the}} development of the vibrator in the late 19th century was in large part due to the requirements of doctors for an easier way to perform genital massage on women, often to 'hysterical paroxysm' (orgasm), which was historically a treatment for the once common medical diagnosis of female hysteria. Maines writes that this treatment had been recommended since classical antiquity in Europe, including in the Hippocratic corpus and by Galen, and continued to be used into the medieval and modern periods, but was not seen as sexual by physicians due to the absence of penetration, and was viewed by them as a difficult and tedious task. Maines writes that the first use of the vibrator at the Salpêtrière was on hysterical women, but notes that Joseph Mortimer Granville denied that he had, or ever would have, used his invention for this purpose; additionally, Maines states that the true use of these medical vibrators, and the vibrators marketed for home use in the early 20th century, was not openly stated, but proceeded under 'social camouflage'. One example of suggestive advertising given is a 1908 advert in National Home Journal for the Bebout hand-powered mechanical vibrator, containing the text [...] "Gentle, <b>soothing,</b> invigorating and <b>refreshing.</b> Invented by a woman who knows a woman's needs." ...|$|R
