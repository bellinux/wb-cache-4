5|$|The {{significance}} of the events at Beaumont-Hamel {{on the first day}} of the Battle of the Somme was perhaps most strongly felt by the Dominion of Newfoundland, as it was the first great conflict experienced by that dominion. Newfoundland was left with a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> that marked an entire generation. The effects on the post-war generation were compounded by chronic financial problems caused both by Newfoundland's large debt from the war, and a prolonged post-war economic recession due to a decline in the fisheries.|$|E
5|$|Horowitz {{points out}} that the film's {{dichotomy}} of absolute good versus absolute evil glosses over the fact that most Holocaust perpetrators were ordinary people; the movie does not explore how the average German rationalized their knowledge of or participation in the Holocaust. Author Jason Epstein commented that the movie gives the impression that if people were smart enough or lucky enough, they could survive the Holocaust; this was not actually the case. Spielberg responded to criticism that Schindler's breakdown as he says farewell is too maudlin and even out of character by pointing out that the scene is needed to drive home the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> and to allow the viewer an opportunity to mourn alongside the characters on the screen.|$|E
25|$|Ó Sé was renowned as a tough defender {{and tight}} marker, a trait best {{exemplified}} {{in the fact}} that he conceded just one solitary point in ten All-Ireland final appearances. He was regarded as a larger-than-life character {{both on and off the}} field and he remains an iconic figure in the annals of Gaelic football in Kerry. Ó Sé's sudden death in December 2012 led to a widespread outpouring of grief amongst the people of Kerry and a deep <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> throughout the wider Gaelic football community.|$|E

50|$|Psychological {{adjustment}} {{in the event}} of a stressor has been linked with meanings finding whether in the form of benefit seeking or making <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the <b>loss.</b> In terms <b>of</b> how meaning is manifested, making <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the <b>loss</b> seems to be more important earlier on in the adjustment process after the loss whereas perceiving the benefit may be a more long term process that occurs over time with the greatest benefit usually experienced later on (Davis, Nolen-Hoeksema & Larson, 1998).|$|R

25|$|The {{preservation}} of local varieties in Singapore {{has been of}} increasing concern in Singapore since the 2000s, especially among the younger generation of Chinese youths. This sudden revival of other varieties can mainly {{be attributed to a}} feeling of disconnection between the younger and the elder generations, as well as a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> of identity from their own linguistic roots for many others. While more work has to be put in to revive these varieties, the recent 2014 Singapore Teochew Festival held in Ngee Ann City can be regarded as a positive sign that more people are becoming more actively involved in reconnecting with their linguistic roots.|$|E
25|$|Atwell often {{returned}} to her native Trinidad, and on one occasion she {{bought a house in}} Saint Augustine, a home she adored and later renamed Winvilla and which was later turned into the Pan Pipers Music School by one of her students, Louise McIntosh. In 1968 she had recorded Ivory and Steel, an album of standards and classics, with the Pan Am Jet North Stars Steel Orchestra (director/arranger Anthony Williams), and supported musical scholarships in the West Indies. In the early 1980s, Atwell's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> following her husband's death made her consider returning to Trinidad to live, but she found the weather too hot.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} argued that the key drivers for Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania are that Kenya wishes to export surplus capital, Uganda seeks an outlet for its surplus labour, and Tanzania wants to realise a Pan-African vision. It has also been argued, however, that the commonalities go far deeper. Many of the {{national}} elites old enough to remember the former EAC often share memories and a sharp <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> at its eventual dissolution. More cynically, others have argued that this historical ambition provides politicians with the ability to present themselves as statesmen and representatives of a greater regional interest. Furthermore, EAC institutions bring significant new powers to dispose and depose to those who serve in them.|$|E

25|$|Feeling a grand <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> {{at court}} {{and unable to}} assert his authority, the Tongzhi Emperor {{returned}} to his former habits. It was rumoured that he caught syphilis and became visibly ill. The physicians spread a rumour that the emperor had smallpox, and proceeded to give medical treatment accordingly. Within a few weeks, on 13 January 1875, the emperor died. The Jiashun Empress followed suit in March. Judging from a modern medical perspective, the onset of syphilis comes in stages, thus the emperor's quick death {{does not seem to}} reflect its symptoms. Therefore, most historians maintain that the Tongzhi Emperor did, in fact, die from smallpox. Regardless, by 1875, Cixi was back onto the helm of imperial power.|$|E

60|$|Now that Christ {{underwent}} {{the wrath}} of God it is evident, because he bare our curse; that God forsook him, he did with strong crying and tears acknowledge; and therefore that he was under the soul-afflicting <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the <b>loss</b> <b>of</b> God's favour, and under the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> his displeasure, must needs flow from the premises.|$|R
500|$|On {{hearing of}} Messiaen's death in 1992, Takemitsu {{was interviewed by}} telephone, and still in shock, [...] "blurted out, 'His death leaves a crisis in {{contemporary}} music!'" [...] Then later, in an obituary written for the French composer in the same year, Takemitsu further expressed his <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> at Messiaen's death: [...] "Truly, he was my spiritual mentor... Among the many things I learned from his music, the concept and experience of color and the form of time will be unforgettable." [...] The composition Rain Tree Sketch II, {{which was to be}} Takemitsu's final piano piece, was also written that year and subtitled [...] "In Memoriam Olivier Messiaen".|$|E
500|$|With the {{increasing}} production of talking {{pictures in the}} early 1930s, film narrators like Heigo began to lose work, and Akira moved back in with his parents. In July 1933, Heigo committed suicide. Kurosawa has commented on the lasting <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> he felt at his brother's death and the chapter of his autobiography (Something Like an Autobiography) that describes it—written {{nearly half a century}} after the event—is titled, [...] "A Story I Don't Want to Tell".

500|$|One of Jakarta's {{best known}} {{fertility}} symbols is the Si Jagur, a Portuguese cannon exhibited {{next to the}} city's History Museum. The writer Aldous Huxley described the gun as a [...] "prostrate God" [...] that women caressed, sat astride and prayed to for children. Near the entrance to Thailand's Ministry of Defence building in Bangkok is a cannon known as the Phaya Tani, an enormous gun captured from the Sultanate of Pattani in 1785. The cannon {{is a symbol of}} cultural identity in Pattani and the profound <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> caused by its seizure is still felt today: when Bangkok refused to return the gun and in 2013 sent a replica instead, suspected insurgents bombed the replica nine days later.|$|E

500|$|Hemingway's {{descriptions}} of the Michigan landscape, {{which would have been}} familiar to him as in his youth he summered at the family's Walloon Lake cottage in Northern Michigan, are presented in a vague and dreamlike manner. Ronald Berman sees Hemingway's treatment of landscape as like a painter's canvas on which he presents Nick's state of mind. The {{descriptions of}} the river's water have been compared to American transcendentalist writer Henry David Thoreau's {{descriptions of the}} pond in Walden. Biographer Meyers sees the story as a blend of American primitivism and sophistication; Nick evidences a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> which is [...] "not simply grace under pressure—but under siege". Nature is perceived as good and civilization as bad—a pervasive theme in American literature, found in such American classics as Mark Twain's 19th-century Huckleberry Finn and in William Faulkner's 20th-century Go Down, Moses.|$|E
500|$|The word, [...] "untrimmed" [...] in line eight, can {{be taken}} two ways: First, in the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> of {{decoration}} and frills, and second, {{in the sense of}} untrimmed sails on a ship. [...] In the first interpretation, the poem reads that beautiful things naturally lose their fanciness over time. [...] In the second, it reads that nature is a ship with sails not adjusted to wind changes in order to correct course. [...] This, in combination with the words [...] "nature's changing course", creates an oxymoron: the unchanging change of nature, or the fact that the only thing that does not change is change. [...] This line in the poem creates a shift from the mutability of the first eight lines, into the eternity of the last six. [...] Both change and eternity are then acknowledged and challenged by the final line.|$|E
500|$|David Julyan {{composed}} the film's synthesized score. Julyan acknowledges several synthesized soundtracks that inspired him, such as Vangelis's Blade Runner and Hans Zimmer's The Thin Red Line. While composing the score, Julyan created different, distinct sounds {{to differentiate between}} the color and black-and-white scenes: [...] "brooding and classical" [...] themes in the former, and [...] "oppressive and rumbly noise" [...] in the latter. Since he describes the entire score as [...] "Leonard's theme", Julyan says, [...] "The emotion I was aiming at with my music was yearning and loss. But a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> you feel {{but at the same}} time you don't know what it is you have lost, a sense of being adrift." [...] Initially, Nolan wanted to use Radiohead's [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] during the end credits, but he was unable to secure the rights. Instead, David Bowie's [...] "Something in the Air" [...] is used, although another of Radiohead's songs, an extended version of [...] "Treefingers", is included on the film's soundtrack.|$|E

500|$|After his wife's death, PedroI {{realized}} how miserably he had treated her, and {{his relationship with}} Domitila began to crumble. Maria Leopoldina, unlike his mistress, was popular, honest and loved him without expecting anything in return. The Emperor greatly missed her, and even his obsession with Domitila failed to overcome his <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> and regret. One day Domitila found him weeping {{on the floor and}} embracing a portrait of his deceased wife, whose sad-looking ghost PedroI claimed to have seen. Later on, the Emperor left the bed he shared with Domitila and shouted: [...] "Get off of me! I know I live an unworthy life of a sovereign. The thought of the Empress does not leave me." [...] He did not forget his children, orphaned of their mother, and was observed {{on more than one occasion}} holding his son, the young Pedro, in his arms and saying: [...] "Poor boy, you are the most unhappy prince in the world." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{children}} {{coming of}} age, Scout and Jem face hard realities {{and learn from}} them. Lee seems to examine Jem's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> about how his neighbors have disappointed him more than Scout's. Jem says to their neighbor Miss Maudie {{the day after the}} trial, [...] "It's like bein' a caterpillar wrapped in a cocoon... I always thought Maycomb folks were the best folks in the world, least that's what they seemed like". This leads him to struggle with understanding the separations of race and class. Just as the novel is an illustration of the changes Jem faces, it is also an exploration of the realities Scout must face as an atypical girl on the verge of womanhood. As one scholar writes, [...] "To Kill a Mockingbird can be read as a feminist Bildungsroman, for Scout emerges from her childhood experiences with a clear sense of her place in her community and an awareness of her potential power as the woman she will one day be." ...|$|E
500|$|Author Ian Inglis {{describes}} [...] "So Sad" [...] as {{the first}} Harrison composition to [...] "explicitly address the collapse of his marriage". The song was copyrighted to Harrisongs in November 1973 as [...] "So Sad (No Love of His Own)", a title that recalls that of the Everly Brothers' hit [...] "So Sad (To Watch Good Love Go Bad)". Along with his song [...] "So Sad", Harrison's 1974 album Dark Horse included {{a version of the}} Everly Brothers' [...] "Bye Bye, Love", the lyrics of which he altered to sarcastically address Boyd's eloping with Clapton. While expressing confusion over the motivation behind this reworking of [...] "Bye Bye, Love", Inglis views [...] "So Sad" [...] as a reflection of the profound <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>loss</b> that Harrison genuinely felt. Among other examples of the depth of the couple's shared experiences, Inglis cites Boyd's role as Harrison's companion at the height of Beatlemania, their joint embrace of Indian spirituality, and her presence throughout his emergence as a solo artist.|$|E
