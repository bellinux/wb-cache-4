Additionally, {{they are good}} sources of bioactive compounds with antioxidant activity, which can be improved {{by the use of}} elicitors. Elicitors act as metabolite-inducing factors (MIF) by mimic stress conditions. Since plants rarely experience a single stress condition one by one but {{are more likely to be}} exposed to simultaneous stresses, it is important to evaluate the effect of elicitors on plant secondary metabolism as mixtures. Jasmonic acid (JA), hydrogen peroxide (HP), and chitosan (CH) were applied to fruits and plants of <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> as mixtures. Bioactive compounds, antioxidant activity, and quality parameters were evaluated. The assessed elicitor cocktail leads to an increase in the variables evaluated (P ≤ 0. 05) when applied to mature fruits after harvest, whereas the lowest values were observed in the treatment applied to immature fruits. Therefore, the application of the elicitor cocktail to harvested mature fruits is recommended in order to improve bioactive compounds and the antioxidant activity of <b>sweet</b> <b>bell</b> <b>peppers...</b>|$|R
40|$|The aryl {{hydrocarbon}} receptor (AhR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that can be activated by a structurally diverse range of synthetic and natural chemicals, and it mediates the toxic and biological effects of environmental contaminants such as 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). The spectrum of chemicals that bind to and activate the AhR signal transduction pathway and the identity of materials containing AhR active chemicals is only now being defined. Utilizing AhR-dependent gel retardation and reporter gene bioassays, the screening of extracts of 22 dietary herbal supplements and 21 food products (vegetables and fruits) was performed to identify those containing AhR agonists. Several herbal extracts (ginseng, Fo-Ti, white oak bark, licorice, ginkgo biloba, and black cohosh) stimulated AhR DNA binding and gene expression to levels between 20 and 60 % of that produced by TCDD. Although some food extracts (corn, jalapeño <b>pepper,</b> green <b>bell</b> <b>pepper,</b> apple, Brussels sprout, and potato) were relatively potent activators of AhR DNA binding (30 - 50 % of TCDD), only corn and jalapeño pepper extracts induced AhR-dependent luciferase reporter gene expression. However, dilution of corn, jalapeño <b>pepper,</b> <b>bell</b> <b>pepper,</b> and potato extracts dramatically increased their ability to induce luciferase activity, suggesting that these extracts contained AhR antagonists whose effectiveness was overcome by dilution. Overall, these results demonstrate that dietary products can be {{a major source of}} naturally occurring AhR ligands to which animals and humans are chronically exposed...|$|R

40|$|<b>Sweet</b> <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> is {{the most}} {{important}} greenhouse vegetable crop in the Netherlands. It is grown on an area of 10, 000 hectares, and about 8000 people are working in these greenhouses. One third of these workers sooner or later develop an occupational allergy to the <b>sweet</b> <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> pollen. The symptoms range from itching, blocking of the nose as well as a sniffling nose, to asthma. The pollen falls down from the flowers when the plants are shaken, which occurs when people are cutting fruits or when they prune or twine the plants. In a pilot study, a number of greenhouses in which honey-bee colonies were introduced were compared with greenhouses without honey-bees. In the greenhouses with honey-bees, hardly any pollen was present on the anthers of the flowers, since it was collected by the honey-bees as a food for their larvae. In flowers of plants in greenhouses without honey-bees, pollen was present most of the time. The symptoms of allergic workers in the greenhouses were significantly reduced by the presence of honey-bees, as was deduced from questionnaires in which the workers were asked to mark the intensity of the symptoms during the past two weeks on a Visual Analogue Scale. The possible beneficial impact of the application of honey-bees on a larger scale needs further research, as well as answering the question of a possible prevention of this occupational allergy in <b>sweet</b> <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> horticulturists by honey-bees.

In this study, fresh carrot, tomato, rhubarb, raspberry, strawberry, red <b>bell</b> <b>pepper,</b> green <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> and yellow <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> samples were subjected to three different extraction methods: aqueous extraction, using phosphate buffer as the extraction solvent; organic extraction, using acidified methanol as the extraction solvent; and solventless extraction, using a Breville home juicer.

Differences in the potential and area of the principal peak, indicative of antioxidant activity and capacity respectively, were analyzed to determine the effect of extraction method on antioxidant measurement.

40|$|Abstract. The {{influence}} of vine water status was studied in commercial vineyard blocks of Vilis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Franc in Niagara Peninsula, Ontario from 2005 to 2007. Vine performance, fruit composition and vine size of non-irrigated grapevines were compared within ten vineyard blocks containing different soil and vine water status. Results showed that within each vineyard block water status zones {{could be identified}} on GIS-generated maps using leaf water potential and soil moisture measurements. Some yield and fruit composition variables correlated with the intensity of vine water status. Chemical and descriptive sensory analysis was performed on nine (2005) and eight (2006) pairs of experimental wines to illustrate differences between wines made from high and low water status winegrapes at each vineyard block. Twelve trained judges evaluated six aroma and flavor (red fruit, black cherry, black current, black <b>pepper,</b> <b>bell</b> <b>pepper,</b> and green bean), thr~e mouthfeel (astringency, bitterness and acidity) sensory attributes as well as color intensity.
