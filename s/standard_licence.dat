50|$|The BNC was {{the first}} text corpus of its size to be made widely available. This could be {{attributed}} to the standard forms of agreement, between rights owners and the Consortium on the one hand, and between corpus users and the Consortium on the other. Intellectual property rights owners were sought for their agreement with the <b>standard</b> <b>licence,</b> including willingness to incorporate their materials in the corpus without any fees. This arrangement may have been facilitated by the originality of the concept and the prominence associated with the project. However, it was a challenge to keep the identity of contributors hidden without discrediting the value of their work. Any distinct allusion to the identity of contributors was largely removed; the alternative solution of substituting the identity of a contributor with a different name was discussed, but not considered feasible.|$|E
50|$|As soon as {{a vehicle}} is purchased, the dealer of the vehicle issues a {{temporary}} licence sticker known colloquially as a TR (To Register) number. This is valid for one month, during which the owner must register the vehicle in the controlling RTO of {{the area in which}} the owner is residing to get a <b>standard</b> <b>licence</b> plate. Some states like Tamil Nadu do not allow vehicles with TR numbers on the road, the dealer will hand over the vehicle to the purchaser only after the registration process is done. To register a vehicle, it has to be presented to the RTO's office, where a Motor Vehicle Inspector will verify the applicant's address and other details, confirm that the engine and chassis numbers are identical to what is written in the application and issues a permanent registration certificate which is usually valid for 20 years. The permanent registration certificate is one of the four important documents a vehicle plying on the road should always have; the others being a valid insurance certificate, a pollution under control (PUC) certificate and the driver's licence. For public utility vehicles like buses, trucks, taxis and pick-up vans, {{there are a number of}} additional documents like a road-worthiness certificate and a transportation permit.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{decentralized}} licensing of complementary patents reading on a technology standard. We develop {{a model in}} which manufacturers must buy licenses from different patent owners in order to enter the market for differentiated standard-compliant products. We consider three different types of licensing, namely, the fixed-fee, per-unit royalty and two-part tariff regimes, and compare their performances in terms of licensing revenue, price, product variety and welfare. We show that each regime entails different types of coordination failures. We establish that each of them may maximize the licensing revenue depending {{on the number of}} licensors, number of potential entrants and product differentiation. <b>Standard</b> <b>Licence</b> Patent Royalty License Complementary innovations...|$|E

40|$|The Green Drop Certification Programme, {{launched}} in 2008 alongside the Blue Drop Certification Programme, aims {{to provide the}} Department of Water Affairs with a national overview of how municipalities and their individual wastewater treatment works (WWTW) are complying with licence conditions set by the National Water Act (NWA) (No. 36 of 1998; DWAF 1998) and the Water Services Act (No. 108 of 1997; DWAF 1998). By publishing the results of each municipality’s performance, the programme aims to ensure continuous improvement in the wastewater treatment sector through public pressure. The programme has been identified by this project as a necessary linking tool between the NWA and the Water Services Act to ensure protection and sustainable use of South Africa’s natural water resources. It does this through assisting municipalities to improve their wastewater treatment operations which in theory will lead to discharged effluent that is compliant with discharge licence conditions. These discharge licences form part of the NWA’s enforcement tool of Source Directed Controls (SDC) which help a water resource meet the ecological goals set for {{it as part of}} Resource Directed Measures (RDM). The link between meeting the required SDC and achieving the RDM goals has never been empirically tested. This project aimed to determine the present ecological condition of the Uie River, a tributary of the Sundays River which the Sundays River Valley Municipality (SRVM) discharges its domestic effluent into. It then determined whether the SRVM’s WWTW was complying with the General <b>Standard</b> <b>licence</b> conditions and what the impact of the effluent on the river was through the analysis of monthly biomonitoring, water chemistry and habitat data. Lastly, the project examined the effectiveness of the Green Drop Certification Programme in bringing about change in the SRVM’s wastewater treatment sector, which previously achieved a Green Drop score of 5. 6 percent. It wanted to examine the underlying assumption that a WWTW which improves its Green Drop score will be discharging a better quality effluent that will help a water resource meets the RDM goals set for it. The Kirkwood WWTW did not have a discharge licence at the time of assessment and was thus assessed under the General <b>Standard</b> <b>licence</b> conditions. It was found that the Kirkwood WWTW was not complying with the General Standard discharge licence conditions in the Uie River. This was having a negative impact on the river health, mainly through high concentrations of Total Inorganic Nitrogen (TIN-N), orthophosphate and turbidity. The SRVM should see an improvement in its Green Drop score for the Kirkwood WWTW. However, the municipality showed no implementation of necessary programmes. Implementation of these programmes would help the SRVM meet the General <b>Standard</b> <b>licence</b> conditions (part of SDC) which would help the Uie River meet the RDM goals set for it...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{revisit the}} 2009 - 2012 episode in which Ofgem imposed a {{non-discrimination}} clause on large retailers in the UK energy market. The <b>Standard</b> <b>Licence</b> Condition 25 A (SLC 25 A) {{was introduced to}} prevent suppliers from charging their incumbent customers higher prices than their out-of-area customers. The SLC 25 A included a “sunset clause”, to allow the condition to lapse three years after its implementation. Several IO economists protested that the prohibition of spatial price discrimination would eventually lead to competition weakening. At {{the end of the}} three-year period, Ofgem decided not to renew SLC 25 A for any period. To further our understanding of Ofgem’s motives and its opponents’ arguments, we build a model where two local monopolists compete on a third market. We determine conditions where the obligation to set the same price {{in and out of the}} local market can result in a better or a worse situation for consumers. We show that even when the ban on price discrimination weakens competition, the average consumer can be better off...|$|E

If you agree to SAP’s <b>standard</b> <b>licence</b> terms and use the software in a way not expressly permitted by the licence, it could cost you {{tens of millions of}} dollars in completely unexpected incremental licence and maintenance fees. That is what happened to a UK company in a questionable decision released in the case of SAP UK Ltd v Diageo Great Britain Ltd. Diageo had paid SAP between £ 50 m and £ 61 m in licence and maintenance fees to use the mySAP Business Suite. It integrated the suite with software from Salesforce using SAP PI integrator software. SAP claimed a staggering £ 54, 503, 578 in additional fees based on API access to its software.
