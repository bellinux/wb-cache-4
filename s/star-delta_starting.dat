50|$|Self-starting {{polyphase}} induction motors produce torque even at standstill. Available {{squirrel cage}} induction motor starting methods include direct-on-line starting, reduced-voltage reactor or auto-transformer starting, <b>star-delta</b> <b>starting</b> or, increasingly, new solid-state soft assemblies and, of course, VFDs.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} defines connectors with 3, 4 and 5 pins, but a non-standard variant with 7 pins (6 in {{a circle}} plus one in the centre) is commercially available; this {{can be used for}} <b>star-delta</b> <b>starting</b> of three-phase motors.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{presenting}} a control system equipped with programmable automation TWIDO for <b>star-delta</b> <b>starting</b> of three-phase asynchronous motors with short circuited rotor. For programming the TWIDO {{programmable logic controller}} (PLC), the program TWIDO-SOFT. EXE is used. The control system is composed of: TWIDO programmable logic controller, high voltage contactor for the asynchronous motor supply, interface for controlling the contactor coils, control buttons and signal circuits. The star- delta automatic start-up of three-phase asynchronous motor is provided...|$|E
50|$|Several {{methods of}} {{starting}} a polyphase motor are used. Where a large inrush current and high starting torque can be permitted, the motor can be started across the line, by applying full line voltage to the terminals (direct-on-line, DOL). Where {{it is necessary to}} limit the starting inrush current (where the motor is large compared with the short-circuit capacity of the supply), the motor is started at reduced voltage using either series inductors, an autotransformer, thyristors, or other devices. A technique sometimes used is <b>star-delta</b> (YÎ”) <b>starting,</b> where the motor coils are initially connected in star configuration for acceleration of the load, then switched to delta configuration when the load is up to speed. This technique is more common in Europe than in North America. Transistorized drives can directly vary the applied voltage as required by the starting characteristics of the motor and load.|$|R
