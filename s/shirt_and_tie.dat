50|$|His {{appearance}} was always immaculate, and his office stationery was all gold plated, a perceived symbol of his wealth. He {{was said to}} own a great many suits, <b>shirts</b> <b>and</b> <b>ties,</b> <b>and</b> prided himself on not having a hair out of place.|$|R
60|$|The {{second part}} of the Via Maqueda is the swell part: silks and plumes, and an {{infinite}} number of <b>shirts</b> <b>and</b> <b>ties</b> <b>and</b> cuff-links and mufflers and men's fancies. One realises here that man-drapery and man-underwear is quite as important as woman's, if not more.|$|R

5|$|The idea of Jesse riding go-karts {{by himself}} to relax was {{inspired}} by Aaron Paul and other crew members who often went kart racing between filming of Breaking Bad episodes in Albuquerque, New Mexico. During one of the party scenes at Jesse's house, Jesse keeps throwing crumpled dollar bills {{at the mouth of}} a sleeping man wearing a dress <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> <b>tie</b> with no pants until he finally gets one inside his mouth. Catlin thought of the idea, and it was property master Trina Siopy actually throwing the bills off-screen; she got one into the actor's mouth on her second try. The scenes in Jesse's house were shot on a set in a sound stage built by production designer Mark Freeborn and construction coordinator William Gilpin. Although scenes in Jesse's house are occasionally filmed in an actual house, these particular scenes could not be shot there because the party was so messy.|$|E

25|$|The {{operational}} uniform, until 2009, {{consisted of}} traditional white <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> <b>tie</b> with custodian helmets for Constables and Sergeants, {{but this was}} dropped when it was deemed to be impractical and outdated, not withstanding the retention of this uniform by other forces, and the almost universal retention of the helmet.|$|E

5000|$|From {{the early}} Victorian period, {{there was a}} decline in the wearing of bright colours and luxurious fabrics by men, with a {{definite}} preference for sobriety of dress. [...] By the mid-20th century, orthodox Western male dress, especially business and semi-formal dress, was dominated by sober suits, plain <b>shirts</b> <b>and</b> <b>ties.</b>|$|R
25|$|During the {{successful}} first run of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, Philbin popularized the monochromatic look in men's formal wear that emphasizes color rather than pattern in ties and dress shirts. His look was a suit, <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> <b>tie</b> coordinated in solid, slightly varying shades of the same, usually dark or muted, color. A Van Heusen clothing line {{based on this}} look, called Regis, was short-lived.|$|E
25|$|During Life on Mars, Hunt often wore a beige camel {{coat with}} a white <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> <b>tie,</b> grey suit and {{trousers}} with white slip on shoes, typical of the period.

In Ashes to Ashes, he is often seen wearing a black suit, striped tie, Crombie coat and snakeskin boots.|$|E
25|$|Díaz Pacheco and {{his brother}} Faustino were active members of the cadets. The {{organization}} became the official youth branch of the Nationalist Party. In accordance with the beliefs of Albizu Campos, organization and discipline were considered the keys to victory, {{in the struggle for}} Puerto Rico's independence. Cadets were required to wear a uniform of white pants and gloves, and everything else - the shirt, tie, belt, boots, military cap - was black. Officers wore a white jacket over the black <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> <b>tie,</b> and a white officer's cap.|$|E

25|$|He {{instituted a}} series of {{socio-economic}} reforms that produced mixed results. Though he was a Jamaican from an elite family, Manley's successful trade union background helped him to maintain {{a close relationship with}} the country's poor majority, and he was a dynamic, popular leader. Unlike his father, who had a reputation for being formal and businesslike, the younger Manley moved easily among people of all strata and made Parliament accessible to the people by abolishing the requirement for men to wear jackets and ties to its sittings. In this regard he started a fashion revolution, often preferring the Kariba suit, a type of formal bush or safari jacket with trousers and worn without a <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> <b>tie.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cruyff {{suffered}} a heart attack (like his father who {{died of a heart attack}} when he was 12) in his early forties. He used to smoke 20 cigarettes a day prior to undergoing double heart bypass surgery in 1991 while he was the coach of Barcelona. Cruyff was forced to immediately give up smoking, and he made an anti-smoking advertisement for the Catalan Department of Health. In the TV spot, Cruyff is dressed like a manager in a long trench coat combined with collared <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> <b>tie.</b> He juggled a cigarette pack 16 times – using feet, thighs, chest, shoulder, and head like holding up a ball – before volleying it away. Throughout the commercial he speaks in Catalan about the dangers of smoking.|$|E
25|$|Between 1947 and 1979, a major uniform change {{took place}} for Victorian Police officers. The bobby helmet was {{replaced}} by a black cloth peak cap, a silver police badge was introduced along with white shirts and ties for the general police officers. In 1963, a white pith helmet with a puggaree hatband and a hand-held radio were added to the Victoria Police general duties officers. Along with a new uniform, Victoria Police also introduced the first uniform for women. The uniform for females featured a knee-length skirt, a button-up jacket, a <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> <b>tie,</b> tights, and peak hats made to fit a lady's hairstyle. Starting with 1972 until 1986, female police officers also carried handbags custom-made to hold batons and firearms.|$|E

50|$|Cluett Peabody & Company, Inc. once {{headquartered}} in Troy, New York, was a longtime manufacturer of shirts, detachable <b>shirt</b> cuffs <b>and</b> collars, and related apparel. It {{is best known}} for its Arrow brand collars <b>and</b> <b>shirts</b> <b>and</b> the related Arrow Collar Man advertisements (1905-1931). It dates, with a different name, from the mid-nineteenth century and was absorbed by Westpoint Pepperell in the 1980s. The Arrow name is still licensed to brand men's <b>shirts</b> <b>and</b> <b>ties.</b>|$|R
25|$|Within {{twenty seconds}} of the announcement, every CBS {{affiliate}} except Dallas' KRLD (which was providing local coverage) was airing the network's feed. The camera was finally operational by this time and enabled the audience to see Cronkite, who was clad in <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> <b>tie</b> but without his suit coat, given the urgent nature of the story. Cronkite reminded the audience, again, of the attempt made {{on the life of}} the President and tossed to KRLD news director Eddie Barker at the Dallas Trade Mart, where Kennedy was supposed to be making a speech before he was shot. Barker relayed information that Kennedy's condition was extremely critical. Then, after a prayer for Kennedy, Barker quoted an unofficial report that the President was dead but stressed it was not confirmed.|$|E
25|$|Luxembourg {{military}} uniforms {{are similar}} to British uniforms, consisting of dress, service or garrison, and field uniforms, often worn with a black beret. Dress uniforms are worn mostly on formal occasions, while service uniforms are worn for daily duty. Luxembourg Army uniforms consist of service and field attire for summer and winter, {{as well as a}} dress uniform and mess jacket for officers. The winter service dress uniform, of olive drab wool, consists of a single-breasted coat having patch pockets with flaps, a khaki <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> <b>tie,</b> and trousers that are usually cuffless. The summer uniform is similar, but made of light tan material. Combat uniforms in olive-green, khaki-drab, or woodland camouflage pattern, worn with the United States PASGT helmet, are virtually indistinguishable from those worn until the 1990s by the United States Army.|$|E
25|$|Equipment (including a gurney) {{from the}} trauma room at Parkland Memorial Hospital, where President Kennedy was {{pronounced}} dead, was purchased {{from the hospital}} {{by the federal government}} in 1973 and is now stored by the National Archives at an underground facility in Lenexa, Kansas. The First Lady's pink suit, the autopsy report, X-rays and President Kennedy's blood-stained jacket, <b>shirt</b> <b>and</b> <b>tie</b> worn during the assassination are stored in the National Archives facility in College Park, Maryland, with access controlled by a representative of the Kennedy family. The rifle used by Oswald, his diary, revolver, bullet fragments, and the windshield of Kennedy's limousine are also stored by the Archives. The Lincoln Catafalque, which President Kennedy's coffin rested on while he lay in state in the Capitol, is on display at the United States Capitol Visitor Center.|$|E
