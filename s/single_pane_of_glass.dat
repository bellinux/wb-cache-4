25|$|Insulating {{glass is}} an {{evolution}} from older technologies known as double-hung windows and storm windows. Traditional double-hung windows used a <b>single</b> <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> {{to separate the}} interior and exterior spaces.|$|E
25|$|Paxton set the {{dimensions}} of this prism by using the length of <b>single</b> <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> (49 inches) as the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, thereby creating a triangle with a length-to-height ratio of 2.5:1, whose base (adjacent side) was 4 feet long. By mirroring this triangle he obtained the 8-foot-wide gables that formed the vertical faces {{at either end of}} the prism, each of which was 24' long. With this arrangement, Paxton could glaze the entire roof surface with identical panes that did not need to be trimmed. Paxton placed three of these 8' x 24' roof units side-by-side, horizontally supported by a grid of cast iron beams, which was held up on slim cast iron pillars. The resulting cube, with a floor area of 24'x 24', formed the basic structural module of the building.|$|E
25|$|The {{next few}} years saw {{development}} in the recreational landscape of Torquay, with the town's first sporting arena, the Recreation Ground being opened in 1888 with a rugby match between Torquay Athletic and local rivals Newton Abbot. Then in 1889 the Winter Gardens were built to provide entertainment for winter holidaymakers. Its cast-iron and glass structure could seat up to 1,000 people for the concerts held by an Italian band, and also featured three tennis courts and a bowling alley. However, the Winter Gardens were not very successful and in 1903 the building was sold to Great Yarmouth. The structure was shipped by barge from Torquay without {{the loss of a}} <b>single</b> <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> and is still in use today (including a brief period during the 1990s as a night club, under the management of comedian Jim Davidson). The Victorian walls of the base are still in their original position in Torquay, and are now the walls of the bar (griffin Bar) open to the public under the Yardley Manor Hotel, Now owned by the Thorogood Family on Museum Road.|$|E
50|$|In early 2007, school {{officials}} said they worry that a child might be seriously injured in an accident involving the school's many large <b>glass</b> windows, some <b>of</b> which are floor-to-ceiling and not shatter-resistant. The windows of the building, which was constructed in 1963, are often made <b>of</b> <b>single</b> <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> instead <b>of</b> more modern double- or triple-panes that insulate better. A few years before 2007, a student {{leaning back in his}} chair accidentally struck a window pane which then shattered.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} originally {{housed the}} Everybodys Theatre, from 1931 the Regent Theatre. The former ticket windows were located {{on either side}} of the main doors; these are still extant, though the windows have since been replaced with <b>single</b> <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass,</b> and the internal walls of one of the ticket offices has been removed. The Hall also housed the library from 1926 to 1967, when it moved to the former Council Chambers. The Rangiora Borough Council occupied the former library space from 1967 to 1981, when the present Council offices were opened on the (former) Institute Hall property.|$|R
40|$|ISBN 978 - 85 - 92631 - 00 - 0 Glazing {{contributes}} {{significantly to}} heat transfer between outdoor and indoor spaces and these surfaces act directly on daylighting and thermal comfort. Based on these aspects, spectrophotometric characterization of double glazings was accomplished to study components for a modular facade {{system for the}} climate of Portugal. This study focused on results of spectrophotometric measurements of optical behavior in the different solar spectrum intervals ultraviolet, visible and near infrared, specifically transmittance of two types of double glazings. The first double glazing presents a <b>single</b> <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> green <b>glass</b> with a solar control foil and a <b>single</b> <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> a <b>glass</b> with an extremely low-emissivity foil; the second one presents a <b>single</b> <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> self-cleaning <b>glass</b> and a float clear annealed glass. Results show the percentage of transmission to spectrum intervals, which enabled the verification of {{the efficiency of the}} glazing in terms of daylighting and the correlation to thermal performance. These results generate subsides and indications for specification and adequate uses of transparent surfaces, and also complements the datasheets available from the manufactures.

5|$|The main design {{differences}} with the Nclass included the cab front, exhaust arrangements, {{and the addition of}} an extra (inside) cylinder between the frames to drive the centre driving axle. Clayton had revised the layout of the cab front spectacle plates (small windows {{on the front of the}} cab) to improve forward visibility. This incorporated two large <b>single</b> <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> either side <b>of</b> the boiler instead of the four smaller windows used on the Nclass. The inside cylinder was to be actuated by Holcroft's design of conjugated valve gear, which consisted of mechanical links fitted to both sets of outside Walschaerts gear, eliminating the need for a separate set of valve gear between the frames to operate the inside cylinder. The result would be a reduction in weight and the amount of mechanical equipment located in this inaccessible part of the locomotive.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Cruncher's apartments {{were not}} in a savoury neighbourhood, and were but two in number, even if a closet with a <b>single</b> <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> in it might be counted as one. But they were very decently kept. Early as it was, on the windy March morning, the room in which he lay abed was already {{scrubbed}} throughout; and between the cups and saucers arranged for breakfast, and the lumbering deal table, a very clean white cloth was spread.|$|E
60|$|A glance {{showed that}} the {{arrangements}} for guarding the treasure were indeed as strong as they were simple. A <b>single</b> <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> cut off {{one corner of the}} room, in an iron framework let into the rock walls and the wooden roof above; there was now no possibility of reopening the case without elaborate labor, except by breaking the glass, which would probably arouse the night watchman who was always within a few feet of it, even if he had fallen asleep. A close examination would have showed many more ingenious safeguards; but the eye of the Rev. Thomas Twyford, at least, was already riveted on what interested him much more--the dull silver disk which shone in the white light against a plain background of black velvet.|$|E
60|$|Now, this back-room was {{immediately}} behind the bar, and some steps lower, {{so that any}} person connected with the house, undrawing a small curtain which concealed a <b>single</b> <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> fixed in {{the wall of the}} last-named apartment, about five feet from its flooring, could not only look down upon any guests in the back-room without any great hazard of being observed (the glass being in a dark angle of the wall, between which and a large upright beam the observer had to thrust himself), but could, by applying his ear to the partition, ascertain with tolerable distinctness, their subject of conversation. The landlord of the house had not withdrawn his eye from this place of espial for five minutes, and Barney had only just returned from making the communication above related, when Fagin, {{in the course of his}} evening's business, came into the bar to inquire after some of his young pupils.|$|E
5000|$|Serious {{problems}} exist {{with the}} existing facade system. The building was designed several years before the 1970s energy crisis, and the facade system does not manage heat at all. [...] The facade of the tower is formed of two parts, the concrete brutalist structure, and wood and glass assembly storefront systems. Many <b>of</b> the original <b>single</b> <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> have been replaced, either with double glazing in the existing wood frame, or plexiglass. The overall result is a minimal improvement in thermal performance. Overall the wood facade elements are warped and cracking, and do not seal well. The single-layer construction bleeds heat at an appreciable rate. Further, the concrete elements bridge from the outdoors to the indoors, conducting heat from the interior to the exterior, where the concrete acts as a heat fin in a phenomenon called a Thermal bridge.|$|R

60|$|How {{often did}} I then wish myself with my dear Glumdalclitch, from whom one single hour {{had so far}} divided me! And I may say with truth, that {{in the midst of}} my own misfortunes I could not forbear lamenting my poor nurse, the grief she would suffer for my loss, the displeasure of the queen, and the ruin of her fortune. Perhaps many {{travellers}} have not been under greater difficulties and distress than I was at this juncture, expecting every moment to see my box dashed to pieces, or at least overset by the first violent blast, or rising wave. A breach in one <b>single</b> <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> would have been immediate death: nor could any thing have preserved the windows, but the strong lattice wires placed on the outside, against accidents in travelling. I saw the water ooze in at several crannies, although the leaks were not considerable, and I endeavoured to stop them as well as I could. I was not able to lift up the roof of my closet, which otherwise I certainly should have done, and sat on the top of it; where I might at least preserve myself some hours longer, than by being shut up (as I may call it) in the hold. Or if I escaped these dangers for a day or two, what could I expect but a miserable death of cold and hunger? I was four hours under these circumstances, expecting, and indeed wishing, every moment to be my last.|$|E
6000|$|Alexander {{is set at}} {{fourteen}} {{to throw}} earth out of a ditch so deep, that it requires the full strength of a grown man, and loses flesh and health under the exertion; he is twice blown up with his own blast in quarrying, and left for dead, recovers slowly, maimed and scarred, {{with the loss of}} an eye. John, when not thirteen, is set to stone-breaking on the roads during intense cold, and has to keep himself from being frostbitten and heart-broken by monkey gambols; takes to the weaving trade, and having helped his family by the most desperate economy to save ten pounds wherewith to buy looms, begins to work them, with his brother as an apprentice, and finds the whole outlay rendered useless the very same year by the failures of 1825- 26. So the two return to day-labour at fourteenpence a-day. John, in a struggle to do task-work honestly, over-exerts himself, and ruins his digestion for life. Next year he is set in November to clean out a watercourse knee-deep in water; then to take marl from a pit; and then to drain standing water off a swamp during an intense December frost; and finds himself laid down with a three months' cough, and all but sleepless illness, laying the foundation of the consumption which destroyed him. But the two brothers will not give in. Poetry they will write; and they write it {{to the best of their}} powers, on scraps of paper, after the drudgery of the day, in a cabin pervious to every shower, teaching themselves the right spelling of the words from some [...] "Christian Remembrancer" [...] or other--apparently not our meek and unbiassed contemporary of that name; and all this without neglecting their work a day or even an hour, when the weather permitted--the [...] "only thing which tempted them to fret," [...] being--hear it, readers, and perpend!--"the being kept at home by rain and snow." [...] Then an additional malady (apparently some calculous one) comes on John, and stops by him for the six remaining years of his life. Yet between 1826 and 1832, John had saved fourteen pounds out of his miserable earnings, to be expended to the last farthing on his brother's recovery from the second quarry accident. Surely the devil is trying hard to spoil these men. But no. They are made perfect by sufferings. In the house with one long narrow room, and a small vacant space at the end of it, lighted by a <b>single</b> <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass,</b> they write and write untiring, during the long summer evenings, poetry, [...] "Tales of the Scottish Peasant Life," [...] which at last bring them in somewhat; and a work on practical economy, which is bepraised and corrected by kind critics in Edinburgh, and at last published-- without a sale. Perhaps one cause of its failure might be found in those very corrections. There were too many violent political allusions in it, complains their good Mentor of Edinburgh; and persuades them, seemingly the most meek and teachable of heroes, to omit them; though Alexander, while submitting, pleads fairly enough for retaining them, in a passage which we will give, as a specimen of the sort of English possible to be acquired by a Scotch day-labourer, self-educated, all but the rudiments of reading and writing, and a few lectures on popular poetry from [...] "a young student of Aberdeen," [...] now the Rev. Mr. Adamson, who must look back on the friendship which he bore these two young men as one of the noblest pages in his life.|$|E

40|$|The {{existing}} {{windows of}} the 90 -year-old buildings on the main MIT campus are not energy efficient and compromise comfort levels. The <b>single</b> <b>panes</b> <b>of</b> <b>glass</b> allow too much heat transfer and solar heat gain. In addition, the steel framework has warped due to oxidation and decay of the glazing compound, resulting in air and water infiltration. This thesis explored a feasible solution of a partial window replacement that would not compromise the historical significance of the existing windows. The design and prototype demonstrated the replacement's functionality and preservation of aesthetic quality. The analysis showed an expected decrease in energy consumption of more than 70 % and cost savings of nearly $ 2 million a year. The analysis also showed that comfort levels are higher throughout the year. by YunJa Chen. Thesis (S. B.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 2007.

50|$|The 1947 FR layout Toyota SA was Toyota's {{first true}} post war design. Although {{permission}} to begin full production of passenger cars in Japan was not granted until 1949, limited numbers of cars {{were permitted to}} be built from 1947, and the Toyota SA was one such car. It had a 4-cylinder engine, 4-wheel independent suspension and a smaller, aerodynamic body. The project was driven by Kiichiro Toyoda, {{but most of the}} design work was done by Kazuo Kumabe. The two-door body was aerodynamic in a style similar to the Volkswagen Beetle. The doors were hinged at the rear (often called suicide doors). The front window was a <b>single</b> <b>pane</b> <b>of</b> flat <b>glass</b> with a single wiper mounted above the driver. Only right hand drive was offered. Toyota engineers (including Dr Kumabe) had visited Germany before World War II and had studied Porsche and Volkswagen designs (independent suspension, aerodynamic bodies, backbone chassis, rear-mounted air-cooled engines, economical production cost). Many Japanese companies had ties with Germany during the war years. But unlike other Japanese car firms Toyota did not partner with Western companies after the war, so it was free to use German designs. Many features of the prototype Beetle were subsequently put into the SA, although the Beetle's rear-mounted air-cooled engine feature was not used. Later on, Toyota revisited the economic principles exemplified by the Beetle when designing the 1950s successors to the SA and the later Publica and Corolla.|$|R
