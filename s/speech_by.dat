40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} the {{determinants}} of media coverage of Federal Reserve (Fed) communications. Our sample covers all 344 forward-looking communications made in the period May 1999 -May 2004. We find, first, {{that there is a}} higher likelihood of media coverage for monetary policy reports and <b>speeches</b> <b>by</b> Greenspan than for testimony and <b>speeches</b> <b>by</b> other Fed members. Furthermore, communications with an explicit monetary policy inclination or tone different from the current interest rate path are particularly likely to be covered. However, the release of important macroeconomic news reduces the likelihood of media coverage. Second, <b>speeches</b> <b>by</b> regional Fed presidents are relatively less likely to be reported than <b>speeches</b> <b>by</b> Board members. Nevertheless, media coverage of Fed president speeches is more likely if central bank communication is stale. Finally, our results indicate that Ben Bernanke played a distinguished role even before his chairmanship...|$|R
