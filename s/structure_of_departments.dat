30|$|STEM change initiatives, {{multiple}} projects {{undertaken to}} broadly improve STEM education, {{have been part}} of the landscape to improve teaching practices in STEM higher education for decades. The success of these resource intensive endeavors relies on multiple individuals who are considered “champions,” enthusiastic persons who can lead efforts (e.g., Scherr et al. 2014). One suggested way to identify these leaders is using social network analysis (SNA) because it can provide a way to study the underlying, hidden <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>departments</b> (Quardokus and Henderson 2015). However, it is unclear whether SNA data alone are adequate for identifying leaders. This paper builds on Quardokus and Henderson’s work by determining whether SNA data by itself is adequate for identifying leaders. The data were collected three times over 4  years at a single institution and analyzed to find differences in network position between leaders and non-leaders.|$|E

40|$|This study {{asserted}} that quality improvement (QI) requires the coexistence of two cultural values of innovation {{and attention to}} detail and proposed that their coexistence depends on the implementation of multiple QI practices. A longitudinal QI intervention, with five phases, consisting of multiple QI practices [...] -ISO 9000, QI teams, quality goals, and coaching and communication by top management [...] -was implemented. Participants were 425 employees working in 18 departments of four manufacturing plants. The QI practices were implemented in a different order in {{each one of the}} plants. Measures were assessed five times, {{at the end of each}} implementation phase. We used hierarchical linear models (HLM) to account for the nested <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>departments</b> within the plants and the five repeated measures. Findings demonstrated that the above-mentioned QI practices had differential effects on innovation and attention to detail: ISO 9000 positively affected attention to detail but negatively affected innovation. Both QI teams and quality goals positively affected innovation. Thus, the multiple QI initiative enabled the coexistence of the two aforementioned cultural values. Both cultural values had a positive impact on performance quality and productivity and partially mediated the effects of ISO 9000 on productivity. quality improvement initiative, organizational culture, innovation, attention to detail, ISO 9000, teams, goals...|$|E

Due to improved evaluation processes, I can proudly state {{that we were able to}} provide departments with reports on their performance within 6 months. In this cycle we evaluated 22 departments, bringing the total number of departments evaluated since 2000 to 75. As this report will indicate, we now have an improved basis on which to review progress and identify trends. I must pause and pay tribute to the Heads of Department who ensured that we received very good co-operation and brought their entire management team on board. This support has raised the bar and resulted in better reports. The Heads of Department were present at most of the pre-evaluation briefing sessions and also the important sessions when the PSC presented its interim reports. The latter resulted in robust debate and what was encouraging was the maturity with which findings were accepted. The commitment to deal with the findings is in contrast to the relative defensiveness that we previously experienced. This approach marks a milestone in that it suggests that departments now accept that Monitoring and Evaluation is an important part of public management. We have found that as our reports get presented to the full management <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>departments,</b> collective responsibility for implementing recommendations is promoted across management...|$|E
40|$|Quality Standards as Flexible Instruments of University Governance Andrea Mignone (University of Genoa) The University is {{currently}} involved in {{changes that have}} a potential for transforming its institutional identity. At stake are the University’s purpose, work processes, organization, system of governance, quality processes and financial basis, {{as well as its}} role in the political system, the economy and society at large. These processes link change in the University to change in the environment in which is embedded: in the role of democratic government, in public-private relations, and in the relationship between the local, national, European and international level. There is a reshaping of institutional purposes and the University jeopardizes its legitimacy by losing sight of its identity and constitutive logic, its distinctive features, functions and achievements as an academic institution. Prevailing trends include fundamental change in the autonomy of the University and in the academic freedom of individual faculty members, in the University’s collegial and disciplinary organization, the unity of research and teaching, who controls specific bodies of knowledge and who defines criteria of excellence and social needs, the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>departments,</b> degree programs and courses, the relations between those who do research and teach and academic and administrative leaders, and in governments’ commitment to funding universities. As often before, a period with a potential for radical change also invites speculations about what kind of organized system the University is and how it works, how the University ought to be organized and governed, what consequences different arrangements are likely to have, and how external demands for radical reform may depend on the University’s capacity for self-governance and adaptation.
