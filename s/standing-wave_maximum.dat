40|$|This is {{the final}} report of a three-year Laboratory-Directed Research and Development (LDRD) project at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). This {{research}} concentrated on the time dependence of the heater, induced-turbulence, and electron-density profiles excited in the ionosphere by a powerful radio-frequency heater wave. The macroscopic density {{is driven by the}} ponderomotive pressure and the density self-consistently determines the heater propagation. For typical parameters of the current Arecibo heater, a dramatic quasi-periodic behavior was found. For about 50 ms after turn-on of the heater wave, the turbulence is concentrated at the first <b>standing-wave</b> <b>maximum</b> of the heater near reflection altitude. From 50 [...] 100 ms the standing-wave pattern drops by about 1 [...] 2 km in altitude and the quasi-periodicity reappears at the higher altitudes with a period of roughly 50 ms. This behavior is due to the half-wavelength density depletion grating that is set up by the ponderomotive pressure at the maxima of the heater standing-wave pattern. Once the grating is established the heater can no longer propagate to higher altitudes. The grating is then unsupported by the heater at these altitudes and decays, allowing the heater to propagate again and initiate another cycle. For stronger heater powers, corresponding to the Arecibo upgrade and the HAARP heater now under construction, the effects are much more dramatic...|$|E
40|$|An x-ray free-electron laser {{oscillator}} (XFELO) is a next-generation x-ray source, similar to free-electron {{laser oscillator}}s at VUV and longer wavelengths but using crystals as high-reflectivity x-ray mirrors. Each output pulse from an XFELO is fully coherent with high spectral purity. The temporal coherence length can further be increased drastically, from picoseconds to microseconds or even longer, by phase-locking successive XFELO output pulses, using the narrow nuclear resonance lines of nuclei such as ^{ 57 }Fe as a reference. We {{show that the}} phase fluctuation due to the seismic activities is controllable and that due to spontaneous emission is small. The fluctuation of electron-bunch spacing contributes mainly to the envelope fluctuation {{but not to the}} phase fluctuation. By counting the number of <b>standing-wave</b> <b>maxima</b> formed by the output of the nuclear-resonance-stabilized (NRS) XFELO over an optically known length, the wavelength of the nuclear resonance can be accurately measured, possibly leading to a new length or frequency standard at x-ray wavelengths. A NRS-XFELO will be an ideal source for experimental x-ray quantum optics as well as other fundamental physics. The technique can be refined for other, narrower resonances such as ^{ 181 }Ta or ^{ 45 }Sc...|$|R
40|$|Thermoacoustic {{engines are}} devices {{suitable}} to convert heat into acoustic energy and viceversa. They are basically composed with a porous medium and two heat exchangers inserted into a resonator or looped tube. Depending on the phase shift between the sound {{pressure and the}} particle velocity of the working fluid, two categories of engines can be realized: standing-wave or travelling-wave devices. Thermodynamic performance of thermoacoustic engines strongly depends on the structural properties of the porous material and the geometric features of the device. In a previous work the authors developed a procedure for optimizing the properties described above to obtain, for a <b>standing-wave</b> device, the <b>maximum</b> acoustic power, given fixed boundary conditions. In this work, the above-mentioned procedure has been extended also for a traveling-wave engine...|$|R
