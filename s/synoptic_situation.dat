40|$|Rapid {{industrialization}} and urbanization have caused severe {{air pollution in}} the Guanzhong basin, northwestern China, with heavy haze events occurring frequently in recent winters. Using the NCEP reanalysis data, the large-scale <b>synoptic</b> <b>situations</b> influencing the Guanzhong basin during wintertime of 2013 are categorized into six types to evaluate the contribution of <b>synoptic</b> <b>situations</b> to the air pollution, including “north-low”, “southwest-trough”, “southeast-high”, “transition”, “southeast-trough”, and “inland-high”. The FLEXPART model has been utilized to demonstrate the corresponding pollutant transport patterns for the typical <b>synoptic</b> <b>situations</b> in the basin. Except for “southwest-trough” and “southeast-high” (defined as favorable <b>synoptic</b> <b>situations),</b> the other four synoptic conditions (defined as unfavorable <b>synoptic</b> <b>situations)</b> generally facilitate the accumulation of air pollutants, causing heavy air pollution in the basin. In association with the measurement of PM 2. 5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2. 5  µm) in the basin, the unfavorable <b>synoptic</b> <b>situations</b> correspond to high PM 2. 5 mass concentrations or poor air quality and vice versa. The same analysis has also been applied to winters of 2008 – 2012, which shows that the basin was mainly influenced by the unfavorable <b>synoptic</b> <b>situations</b> during wintertime leading to poor air quality. The WRF-CHEM model has further been applied to simulate the selected 6  days representing the typical <b>synoptic</b> <b>situations</b> during the wintertime of 2013, and the results generally show a good agreement between the modeled distributions and variations of PM 2. 5 and the corresponding <b>synoptic</b> <b>situations,</b> demonstrating reasonable classification for the <b>synoptic</b> <b>situations</b> in the basin. Detailed meteorological conditions, such as temperature inversion, low-level horizontal wind speed, and planetary boundary layer, all contribute to heavy air pollution events in the basin under unfavorable synoptic conditions. Considering the proportion of occurrence of unfavorable <b>synoptic</b> <b>situations</b> during wintertime, reduction of emissions is the optimum approach to mitigate the air pollution in the Guanzhong basin...|$|R

5000|$|Lidars {{are capable}} of {{retrieving}} the complete wind vector based on the optical Doppler effect. The so-called Doppler lidars can capture the movement of molecules and particles by detecting the frequency shift of the backscattered light. In particular, supposing that the emitting radiation is at a frequency f0=c/λ0, where λ0 is the wavelength of the laser beam, for a moving target (i.e., aerosol particle or molecule) with a relative line-of-sight velocity v, the backscattered light detected by the lidar receiver has a frequency shift equal to Δf=2v/c. The particle velocity is defined where a positive line-of-sight velocity means that a target is moving towards the lidar and leads to a positive frequency shift. In literature regarding lidar applications, the line-of-sight velocity is always referred as radial velocity. The magnitude of the shift can be detected by several methods, the major being coherent and direct-detection detection techniques [...] When aerosols are used as tracers, {{the strength of the}} return signal depends upon the aerosol load in the atmosphere and this is known to be dependent upon geographic location, the condition of the atmosphere, and the <b>synoptic</b> <b>situation.</b> The operational wavelength can be any wavelength sensitive to the underlying particle sizes. In general, aerosol return improves at lower wavelengths in the UV band. Nevertheless, the lidar signal gets more sensitive to air molecules in the UV band, and an expected aerosol-to-molecule backscatter ratio is harder to be met. Doppler lidars are usually pointed to zenith and provide vertically-resolved profiles of the vertical wind component. Scanning techniques are applied to retrieve the horizontal wind component. Several such systems are operated from the ground for applications related to e.g. airports, wind-farms, study of the Planetary Boundary Layer turbulence etc. The ADM-Aeolus satellite mission of the European Space Agency, will be the first wind lidar to operate from space.|$|E

An exponential POT model is used to fit the distribution of each sub-sample. The distribution of the multi-exponential weather patterns (MEWP) is then defined as the composition, for a given season, of all WP sub-sample marginal distributions, weighted by the relative frequency of occurrence of each WP. The MEWP distribution appears able to fit various shapes of distributions using a simple and robust approach for asymptotic behaviour. It is a new contribution to the ongoing debate on the probabilistic tools used to study the asymptotic behaviour of extreme rainfall from observed records.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a probabilistic model for daily rainfall, using sub-sampling based on meteorological circulation. We classified eight typical but contrasted <b>synoptic</b> <b>situations</b> (weather patterns) for France and surrounding areas, using a "bottom-up" approach, i. e. from {{the shape of}} the rain field to the <b>synoptic</b> <b>situations</b> described by geopotential fields. These weather patterns (WP) provide a discriminating variable that is consistent with French climatology, and allows seasonal rainfall records to be split into more homogeneous sub-samples, in term of meteorological genesis. First results show how the combination of seasonal and WP sub-sampling strongly influences the identification of the asymptotic behaviour of rainfall probabilistic models. Furthermore, with this level of stratification, an asymptotic exponential behaviour of each sub-sample appears as a reasonable hypothesis. This first part is illustrated with two daily rainfall records from SE of France. The distribution of the multi-exponential weather patterns (MEWP) is then defined as the composition, for a given season, of all WP sub-sample marginal distributions, weighted by the relative frequency of occurrence of each WP. This model is finally compared to Exponential and Generalized Pareto distributions, showing good features in terms of robustness and accuracy.
