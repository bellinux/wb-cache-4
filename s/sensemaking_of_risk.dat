Traffic safety behaviours are focused. Eight focus group interviews have been done, with a total number of 36 interviewees {{in the age of}} 16 – 20 years. Half of the groups where made in Greater Stockholm, and half in the county of Jämtland. Four aspects of place attachment where explored.

In total 24 interviews were made with people in Ostersund. The result shows that the interviewees related to social as well as spatial dimensions when they made sense of this risky situation, which can be understood in relation to the concept of <b>sensemaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk.</b> Six groups among the interviewees emerged in the analysis, illustrating how different aspects of the risk where focused in the process of sensemaking. Further, the study shows that the process of sensemaking was built upon direct as well as indirect social relations, where the interviewees made sense of the risk by relating to people who were close to them as well as to people to whom they had no personal relation. These indirect social relations were defined as: elderly, children and people in other countries, which also points at the fact that the interviewees made sense of the risk in a global context. Finally, the results suggest that social relations could be further explored in future studies in <b>sensemaking</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk.</b> Sociologisk Forsknings digitala arkiv</p...|$|E

Such language games intersect within the hospital environment. This paper appraises issues <b>of</b> clinical <b>risk</b> through the re-examination {{of the language}} games which formed a {{part of one of}} Britain's worst medical disasters, namely the Bristol Royal Infirmary tragedy. A textual, grounded analysis of transcripts from the oral hearings of the 'Bristol Inquiry' (n = 74) provides the paper with a qualitative dataset, within which medical language games are analysed. The paper concludes that clinical actors work within discourses <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> (McDonald et al. 2005) that are partly constructed within, and by, participation in language games (Wittgenstein 1953). In the case of the Bristol Royal Infirmary tragedy, these games manifested contrasting interpretations <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> and safety which reflected a tainted interpretation of data by different parties at different times of the unfolding tragedy. <b>Sensemaking</b> <b>of</b> reputation appears to have played an important part in the construction of these interpretations <b>of</b> <b>risk...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} social dimension {{of knowledge in}} an organisational context. Inspired and informed by <b>sensemaking</b> views <b>of</b> organisations (Weick, 1995), our inquiry focuses on knowledge as both an input to and a product <b>of</b> <b>sensemaking</b> processes at four different levels in organisations: the intra-subjective <b>sensemaking</b> <b>of</b> an individual; the inter-subjective sensemaking in social interactions; the generic subjective (organisational) and the extrasubjective or cultural level <b>of</b> <b>sensemaking</b> (Wiley, 1988, 1994). Starting from this basic framework, we develop a <b>Sensemaking</b> Model <b>of</b> Knowledge in organisations that identifies four types of knowledge individual, collective, organisational and cultural knowledge created, used and maintained at respective sensemaking levels. The objective of the paper is to demonstrate how the Sensemaking Model can help us understand knowledge management phenomena and explain their impacts on organisational performance.

Automatic graph layout algorithms, augmented with real-time human-in-the-loop interaction, can potentially support <b>sensemaking</b> <b>of</b> large graphs. However, designing interactive algorithms to achieve this is challenging. In this paper, we tackle the scalability problem of interactive layout of large graphs, and contribute a new GPU-based force-directed layout algorithm that exploits graph topology. This algorithm can interactively layout graphs {{with millions of}} nodes, and support real-time interaction to explore alternative graph layouts. Users can directly manipulate the layout of vertices in a force-directed fashion. The complexity of traditional repulsive force computation is reduced by approximating calculations based on the hierarchical structure of multi-level clustered graphs. We evaluate the algorithm performance, and demonstrate human-in-the-loop layout in two sensemaking case studies. Moreover, we summarize lessons learned for designing interactive large graph layout algorithms on the GPU...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ed. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2007. A {{study of}} school {{leadership}} in urban school districts touches central issues of educational transformation and {{elimination of the}} "achievement gap". This qualitative capstone study focused on eight K- 12 Seattle School District principals completing a year-long School Leadership Program (SLP) course provided by the Center for Educational Leadership (CEL), associated with the University of Washington College of Education's Educational Leadership and Policy Studies (EdLPS) department. Study questions addressed principals' <b>sensemaking</b> <b>of</b> instructional leadership learning, the critical inquiry process and principal professional development. Findings revealed the strong desire for SLP-type professional development [...] -job-embedded, instructionally focused, and centered on school problems. Participants in the course also found opportunities for collegiality among leaders who seek equity and excellence. SLP activities facilitated <b>sensemaking</b> <b>of</b> instructional leadership. A coached learning walk was significant in learning about powerful instruction. As well, creating a social context for learning, making content obviously relevant to practice and focusing on a few connected ideas around a single content area were important in ensuring principals' needs were met. Critical inquiry projects impacted <b>sensemaking</b> <b>of</b> instructional leadership by facilitating comprehension of {{a complex set of}} variables and aligning an intentional leadership response. But the findings showed that critical inquiry is highly demanding for the beginning user. Given the complexity of the process, {{it is not surprising that}} the first efforts of participants were incomplete. The limitations of participants' development of critical inquiry underscore the need for continued engagement. Modest gains were made in instructional leadership learning. But taking into account the complexity of the task, as well as the relatively short length of the course, this was an important beginning. Recommendations for district leaders included continuing and strengthening the SLP-district partnership, pursuing a "critical mass" strategy to increase participation; encouraging greater involvement in an in-district SLP; and relieving principals of site-management responsibilities to allow more time for instructional leadership development. Recommendations for CEL in developing future School Leadership Programs included increasing coached walkthroughs; focusing on a single subject area to facilitate <b>sensemaking</b> <b>of</b> content knowledge; supporting all aspects of instructional leadership work; and deepening engagement in critical inquiry...|$|R

This capstone compares results from <b>sensemaking</b> <b>of</b> narratives with results from the Warfighter Technology Tradespace Methodology (WTTM), a system designed for the rapid fielding of equipment for small forward operating bases (FOBs) and combat outposts (COPs). The capstone finds that 1) soldier narratives inform the fielding process by providing an additional layer of meaning and context, and 2) soldier narratives do not replace current feedback mechanisms; rather, they play a complementary role. This capstone finds that narratives as a feedback mechanism can be applied during operational testing of newly developed or fielded equipment for the DOD‘s CDP.

40|$|This {{research}} identifies {{an important}} {{gap in the}} CSR literature: there are no theories {{to account for the}} way in which organisations use their internal communication to create meaning around CSR. Based on {{a review of the literature}} and a participant-observation in an engineering consultancy, this exploratory paper presents an attempt at theory development in this field, by drawing on the concepts <b>of</b> <b>sensemaking</b> (Weick, 1995), sensegiving (Gioia & Chittipeddi, 1991), and enactment (Weick, 1979). A first model is developed to identify the factors which may shape the success of attempts by groups of individuals or powerful individuals to create meanings for the company’s employees. These are their capacity to manage meaning, their personality, occupation and department, their ability to translate a broad subject into identifiable actions, and their skill at drawing legitimacy from organisational values in their attempts to give sense. This same model identifies factors which shape the way in which meaning is interpreted: the presence of competing narratives within the organisation and the occupation of the people making sense. A second model is developed to understand the process of organisational enactment; in other words, the process by which the organisation shapes the <b>sensemaking</b> <b>of</b> its employees by creating meaning through action, selecting among conflicting interpretations, and storing the interpretations in its organisational ‘memory’ thereby shaping the <b>sensemaking</b> <b>of</b> its employees.

40|$|This {{study is}} about {{everyday}} conflicts that occur at work; how meaning and action interact in processes of conflict handling in organisational conflicts that arise naturally in every arena {{of daily life}} when people meet in social interactions. I approach the phenomenon of conflict by exploring those social processes <b>of</b> organisational <b>sensemaking</b> that arise when conflict occurs in a nonprofit organisation, my own processes <b>of</b> <b>sensemaking</b> <b>of</b> the research process about conflict, and conflict research literature’s <b>sensemaking</b> <b>of</b> the concept of conflict. Weick argues that “[t]he basic idea <b>of</b> <b>sensemaking</b> is that reality is an ongoing accomplishment that emerges from efforts to create order and make retrospective sense of what occurs” (1993, p. 653). Accordingly, sensemaking is conceptualised {{as a process of}} social construction where individuals attempt to interpret and explain sets of cues, or signals from their environments. The term can also be applied to the craft <b>of</b> research as <b>sensemaking,</b> in which researchers as sensemakers actively analyse the empirical material and generate representations of how reality is (Weick, 1989). Accordingly, in this study, I basically aim to understand conflict at work and understand research about conflict at work; that is, how conflict, as a social phenomenon, plays out in organisational cultures and group dynamics, and how conflict is conceptualised in conflict research literature. The study examines the following research questions from a sensemaking perspective: 1) How is conflict conceptualized in conflict research literature? 2) How do staff and management experience and act out conflicts in the nonprofit organisation of NGO Plus and how does changing conflict sensemaking affect conflicts at work? 3) What is my process of theorizing in conflict research...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore <b>sensemaking</b> <b>of</b> {{incidents}} by health care professionals through an analysis of the role of professional identity in narratives of incidents. Using insights from social identity theory, the authors argue that incidents may create a threat of professional identity, and that professionals make use of identity management strategies in response to this identity threat. Design/methodology/approach – The paper draws on a qualitative analysis of incident narratives in 14 semi-structured interviews with physicians, nurses, and residents at a Dutch specialist hospital. The authors used an existing framework of identity management strategies to categorize the narratives. Findings – The analysis yielded two main results. First, nurses and residents employed multiple types of identity management strategies simultaneously, which points to the possible benefit of combining different strategies. Second, physicians used the strategy of patronization of other professional groups, a specific form of downward comparison. Research limitations/implications – The authors discuss the implications of the findings in terms of the impact of identity management strategies on the perpetuation of hierarchical differences in health care.

40|$|International audienceTaking Weick's theory <b>of</b> <b>sensemaking</b> as illustrative <b>of</b> a socio-constructionist {{conception}} <b>of</b> <b>sensemaking</b> {{and learning}} in organization studies, I examine the methodological approaches used in this research. This analysis reveals that, although departing from the structuro-functionalist perspective of conventional cognitive theory, sensemaking research nonetheless aims to establish objective knowledge of these subjective processes. In so doing, it is faced with the interpretive paradox implied in seeking an 'objective science of subjectivity'. Fully acknowledging that studying sensemaking is an active and subjective sense-making process in itself implies that we re-engage in sensemaking processes. The postmodern route, on the one hand, invites us, through deconstruction, to engage against our sensemaking {{as a way of}} uncovering both the constitutive and the undecidable character <b>of</b> <b>sensemaking</b> activities. The pragmatist (or participative) route, on the other hand, suggests that, through participative action research, we fully engage in sensemaking with organization members and recognize the socially constructed aspect <b>of</b> all <b>sensemaking</b> activities.

However, it does not explicitly account for how organizational actors make sense of and enact IS in their local context. We address this limitation by showing how sensemaking theory can be combined with institutional theory to understand IS adaptation in organizations. Based on a literature review, we present the main assumptions behind institutional and sensemaking theory when used as analytical lenses for investigating the phenomenon of IS adaptation. Furthermore, we explore a combination of the two theories with a case study in a health care setting where an Electronic Patient Record (EPR) system was introduced and used by a group of doctors. The empirical case provides evidence of how existing institutional structures influenced the doctors’ <b>sensemaking</b> <b>of</b> the EPR system. Additionally, it illustrates how the doctors made sense of the EPR system in practice. The paper outlines that: 1) institutional theory has its explanatory power at the organizational field and organizational/group level of analysis focusing on the role that larger institutional structures play in organizational actors’ <b>sensemaking</b> <b>of</b> IS adaptation, 2) sensemaking theory has its explanatory power at the organizational/group and individual/socio-cognitive level focusing on organizational actors’ cognition and situated actions of IS adaptation, and 3) a combined view of the two theories helps us oscillate between levels of analysis, which facilitates a much richer interpretation of IS adaptation.
