In the present research, the complimentary CPTU tests with pore pressure dissipation phase and soil laboratory tests (including consolidation, permeability and triaxial tests) are also performed on silty sand samples with different <b>silt</b> <b>content.</b> In this study, six piezocone tests are performed in saturated silty sand samples with several different <b>silt</b> <b>contents</b> ranging from zero to 50 percent. The pore pressure dissipation tests are also carried out in samples and t 50 (the time for 50 % pore pressure dissipation) is evaluated.

The moving debris in traditional numerical modeling is assumed as hydrostatic along the flow depth, {{which is not the}} actual case when the generation of excess pore pressure in the shear zone significantly influences the flow mobility. The thesis studies the excess pore pressure built-up in the shear zone of the moving debris by using a rotating drum apparatus, which can rotate itself to provide the shear rate and generate the shear stress on the basal layer of the debris material.

The <b>silt</b> <b>content</b> of inlet A, {{inlet flow}} B and {{underflow}} diameter C were the important factors on the separation {{efficiency of the}} hydrocyclone, using hydrocyclone for pretreatment of high turbidity silt water.

Concept of limiting fines content (LFC) was verified by these undrained monotonic triaxial tests. LFC {{was found to be}} the very important parameter to understand {{the behavior of}} sand–silt mixtures. The behavior of sand–silt mixture changes approximately at LFC. At constant relative density, increase in <b>silt</b> <b>content</b> decreases the undrained peak shear strength till LFC. After LFC the strength becomes near about same till pure silt sample. The reason of behavior could not be explained. At constant global void ratio, the peak shear strength decreases with increase in <b>silt</b> <b>content</b> till LFC and for further increment of <b>silt</b> <b>content</b> the peak shear strength increases.

40|$|Studies from a {{wide variety}} of {{ecosystems}} indicate that primary producers may protect their environment against degrading processes such as erosion by water current or wind. Theoretical analyses showed that the dynamics of these systems are governed by positive feedback. We investigated the implications of a positive feedback between growth of benthic diatoms and erosion of silt in tidal flat systems. A simple mathematical model shows that alternate stable states may occur in systems with positive feedback between diatom growth and silt accumulation, particularly in sediments with intermediate bottom shear stress. High diatom cover, high <b>silt</b> <b>content,</b> and low levels of erosion characterize one state. The other state is dominated by erosion, and hence both diatom cover and <b>silt</b> <b>content</b> are low. In an experimental study, we tested the critical model assumption that the growth rate of diatoms increases with the <b>silt</b> <b>content</b> of the sediment. Net growth of diatoms was significantly higher on silt than on sandy sediment after nine days of incubation, supporting the premise that diatom–silt interactions are governed by positive feedback. Furthermore, we compared model predictions to data on the physical and biological properties of sediments of a tidal flat. In accordance with our model, the <b>silt</b> <b>content</b> of sediments with intermediate to high bottom shear stress showed a clear and significant bimodal distribution, which may reflect the existence of alternate stable states. At low bottom shear stress, <b>silt</b> <b>content</b> was better explained by a unimodal distribution, as was predicted by our model. Patterns in chlorophyll a content were less clear. Nevertheless, chlorophyll a content was best explained by a bimodal distribution at high bottom shear stress, and in two of the three periods at low bottom shear stress. Our study indicates that the positive feedback between enhanced production of diatoms and decreased erosion of sediment significantly affects the dynamics of intertidal flat systems. ...|$|R

Undrained stress controlled cyclic triaxial tests were carried out on cylindrical samples of size 50 mm diameter and height 100 mm with different cyclic stress ratios. Laboratory evaluations were carried out to compare the cyclic resistance of clean sand to that of sand with various fines contents at a constant gross void ratio. The gross void ratio considers the voids formed by sand particles and fines. The effects of gross void ratio with and without fines on pore water pressure build up and liquefaction potential of sandy soils in stress controlled tests are presented.

According to [Yangtze Aquatic Resources Survey Group (1988]), when the water level fluctuated little and wind was from the south, Chinese sturgeon tended to travel upstream, while when the water level rose or fell sharply and the wind was northerly, the fish tended to remain in a fixed location. They found that, in addition to the effects of water temperature, the specific dates of the first and second spawning periods were related to water level and <b>silt</b> <b>content</b> as well as flow velocity. The final water level increase in the autumn had obvious effects on spawning activities ([Yangtze Aquatic Resources Survey Group 1988]). Other researchers have suggested that appropriate water temperature is essential for spawning. According to this premise, when water level, flow velocity, and <b>silt</b> <b>content</b> enter a downward trend from high levels and all hydrological elements are in a suitable range, spawning will begin ([Wei 2003]; [Yang et al. 2007]). By establishing a model of the hydrological environment influencing A. sinensis spawning, [Zhang (2009]) considered that <b>silt</b> <b>content</b> in the river dropped dramatically after completion of the Three Gorges Project (TGP) in 2003, declining more than 90 %, probably having adverse effects on A. sinensis natural reproduction.|$|R

A series of oedoemeter and resonant column tests were conducted to study the effect of applied pressure, void ratio, water <b>content</b> and <b>silt</b> <b>content</b> on the collapse potential (Cp), maximum shear modulus (Gmax) and damping ratio (DT) of the tested samples.

Though a few real-world measurements of road dust {{have been done}} by automated samplers in Sweden, measurement by BSNE (Big Spring Number Eight) and the estimation of total dust generation from vehicle driving is rare. This study measured and analyzed {{dust emission}} by BSNE at two unpaved roads in Luleå, Sweden, at the driving speed of 20, 30, 40, and 50 km/h different heights. Even though US EPA excluded vehicle speed as a parameter in estimating dust emission factors for unpaved roads, this study confirmed a strong dependence of dust emission on vehicle speed. This is in agreement with several recent studies which concluded dust emission increases with driving speed exponentially or linearly, however the power law is the best description for the data from this study.

30|$|It was {{noticed that}} the area under natural savanna forest cover at high {{altitude}} was also used for grazing. The frequent burning of grass {{during the dry season}} by cattle herdsmen and trampling effects due to overgrazing is suggested to have influence soil structure as burning destroys and removes soil organic matter, thereby loosening of soil particles and encouraging water erosion on gentle slopes. In addition, the E. saligna plantation here was located on steep slopes, with abundant leaf litter and no vegetation understory. It can be suggested that the <b>silt</b> <b>content</b> under natural savanna, grazing land and E. saligna plantation were lower due to accelerated water erosion. The lack of ground cover and understory may have contributed to initiating erosion which selectively washes away clay and silt. At mid-altitude, the soils under grazing land use systems had the highest percentage of <b>silt</b> <b>content</b> (53 %) while those under the afforestation land use projects in the Yongka Park had the lowest percentage (47 %). At this altitude, mean percentage <b>silt</b> <b>content</b> at the surface (0 – 15  cm) layer showed no significant difference (P >  0.01) between the soils under all the land use/land cover systems. The soils under the afforestation stand were located on the shoulder of the slope and signs of severe erosion (rills and gullies) were observed, compared to those of grazing land. Geologically, on a midslope, the rate of soil erosion is increased and the topsoil layer is greatly reduced. At low altitude, the soils under the E. saligna plantation had the highest percentage of <b>silt</b> <b>content</b> (52 %) while those under farmland use systems had the lowest (42 %). At this altitude, mean percentage <b>silt</b> <b>content</b> at the surface (0 – 15  cm) layer showed no significant difference (P >  0.01) between the soils under all the land use/land cover systems. Here the soils under the E. saligna plantation were located on the toe slope (flat surface) and signs of severe deposition (siltation, floods and stagnant water bodies) were generally observed in the area after heavy rainfall. Geologically, on the toe slope, the rate of soil erosion is minimal and the topsoil layer is mostly comprised of mineral deposits transported principally by water (erosive agent) from top and shoulder slopes. However, soils under farmland use systems are prone to erosion comparatively.|$|R

30|$|An {{important}} {{finding was}} that the average clay content especially in the lower soil layers under rice-sugarcane systems in sites 3 and 4 was comparatively greater than other sites. Sand content decreased towards lower soil layers in every cropping system; whereas clay contents increased gradually towards lower soil depths. Because of high clay content, those exceeded 40 %, the soils of lower layers are mostly clayey. Due to heavy rainfall during rainy season and tillage operations for rice cultivation, the clay fractions were greater in the lower layers. This {{might be due to}} the clay migration from upper soil to the lower layers. The difference in settling of soil particles in the soil layers due to repeated plouging might have attributed to the difference in sand and clay contents in different sites. Agoumé and Birang (2009) also reported similar results for the fields of Ngoungoumou village near Ebolowa in Cameroon.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} results of a research effort conducted to better understand the stress-strain, volume change, shear band formation, and strength characteristics of normally consolidated anisotropic clay under fully three-dimensional stress states. A series of consolidated drained true triaxial tests with a constant mean effective stress and constant Lode angles during shear are performed on cross-anisotropic kaolin clay. All tests are performed in a fully automated true triaxial testing apparatus. The relative magnitude of the intermediate principal stress, expressed in terms of the b-value, and initial cross-anisotropy show significant influence on the stress-strain, volume change, strength, and shear band formation characteristics of the clay. Shear bands form and appear to cause failure in all true triaxial tests performed, except in triaxial compression. The initiation and development of shear bands is observed to take place when the clay undergoes volumetric contraction. The lower strength exhibited in the shear bands is caused by alignment of the clay particles. This shear band mechanism is different from that observed in granular materials in which the lower shear strength is reached due to dilation in the shear bands. This dissertation also presents a study on the simulative capabilities of anisotropic and isotropic elasto-plastic bounding surface models under fully three-dimensional stresses. The models assume the associated plastic flow rule and are based on bounding surface elastoplasticity and the critical state theory. The predictions of the models are compared to the stress-strain, volume change, and strength characteristics observed in drained true triaxial tests with a constant effective mean stress and constant Lode angles during shear on normally consolidated anisotropic kaolin clay. The bounding surface models can predict the influence of intermediate principal stress on the behavior of the clay but with magnitudes considerably different from those observed in the experimental results. The effects of initial cross-anisotropy on the behavior of the clay, however, cannot be fully predicted by the anisotropic bounding surface model. These incapabilities are largely due to the use of associated plastic flow rule. More realistic predictions can also be obtained by incorporating a model feature that allows bifurcation from the uniform stress-strain conditions into a localized failure mode or shear bands. This dissertation also includes the details and results of a laboratory study on the influence of non-plastic <b>silt</b> <b>content</b> on the stress-strain, volume change, and strength characteristics of transition silt-clay soils. Series of one-dimensional consolidation tests, isotropic consolidation tests, and triaxial compression tests on three soils of similar base clay but different non-plastic <b>silt</b> <b>contents</b> are performed on cross-anisotropic specimens.
