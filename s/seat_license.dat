25|$|By {{the end of}} 1999, the Packers {{believed}} {{that they needed to}} update the facility to remain financially competitive in the NFL. Rather than build a new stadium, Chairman/CEO Bob Harlan and President/COO John Jones unveiled a $295 million plan to renovate Lambeau Field in January 2000. It was to be paid for partly by the team via the 1997–98 stock sale, which netted more than $20 million. Most of the proceeds were to be paid through a 0.5% sales tax in Brown County and personal <b>seat</b> <b>license</b> fees on season ticket holders. After their plan won approval by the Wisconsin State Legislature, it was ratified by Brown County voters on September 12, 2000 by a 53%–47% margin. Construction began early in 2001. The sales tax expired on September 30, 2015.|$|E

50|$|A {{personal}} <b>seat</b> <b>license,</b> or PSL, is a paid license that entitles {{the holder}} {{to the right}} to buy season tickets for a certain seat in a stadium. This holder can sell the <b>seat</b> <b>license</b> to someone else if they no longer wish to purchase season tickets. However, if the <b>seat</b> <b>license</b> holder chooses not to sell the seat licenses and does not renew the season tickets, the holder forfeits the license back to the team. Most seat licenses are valid {{for as long as the}} team plays in the current venue.|$|E

50|$|The Titans have posted an {{impressive}} record at Nissan Stadium since moving there in 1999, including winning their first 16 games before {{losing to the}} Baltimore Ravens on November 12, 2000. Overall, the Titans are 45-27 {{in the regular season}} and 2-2 in playoff games at Nissan Stadium. Every Titans home game (including preseason) has been a sellout since the stadium opened in 1999. This is due to fans purchasing season tickets associated with the personal <b>seat</b> <b>licenses</b> each season ticketholder must own. The <b>seat</b> <b>licenses</b> helped finance construction of the stadium. There is a long waiting list for personal <b>seat</b> <b>licenses,</b> as well as season tickets.|$|R

Ohanian described his plan in a Letter to The Editor of the Columbus Dispatch, published on March 2, 1987, entitled [...] "Ticketbond is Answer to Financing Proposed Facility".|$|E
50|$|This initial {{proposal}} {{called for}} the stadium {{to be paid for}} by a combination of $250 million from Rams, a $200 million loan from the NFL, $130 million from personal <b>seat</b> <b>license</b> sales, $55 million in tax credits and other public incentives, $350 million from extending the state bonds originally issued for the construction of the Edward Jones Dome.|$|E

50|$|Seat {{licenses}} {{have been}} given various names. The most common term in North America is personal <b>seat</b> <b>license</b> and in Europe is debenture. The primary reason sporting venues offer PSLs is that the proceeds are used to help pay the debt incurred during {{the construction of the}} stadium or arena. Opponents of PSLs see this as another way to extract money from the sports fans.|$|E

50|$|Designed by Jenkins·Peer Architects and the DLR Group, the horseshoe-shaped stadium has a {{capacity}} of 15,314 people. Much of the current home side seating area is available with {{the purchase of a}} personal <b>seat</b> <b>license.</b> The venue includes various amenities, such as the Judy W. Rose football center, which includes athletic and academic facilities. Located on the UNC Charlotte campus, parking is expected to be limited on game days, although public transportation routes to reach the stadium are currently under construction.|$|E
50|$|A {{personal}} <b>seat</b> <b>license</b> (PSL) is {{a license}} which grants the holder {{the right to}} buy season tickets for a particular team. PSLs were first used in the NFL by the expansion Carolina Panthers in 1993 to help finance their new stadium. Since that time, several teams have used the mechanism to finance new stadium projects including the Chicago Bears remodel of Soldier Field and more recently the Dallas Cowboys. The New York Jets and the New York Giants used PSL programs to finance the construction of the New Meadowlands Stadium, now MetLife Stadium.|$|E
50|$|To {{generate}} {{financial support}} for {{the launch of the}} football program, Chancellor Dubois created a program called Forty Niner <b>Seat</b> <b>Licenses,</b> or FSLs, which essentially served as seat deposits for season tickets. The Chancellor initially set forth a goal of 5,000 FSL reservations within 6 months. However, due to the tremendous level of support for the new program, the goal was met in only 2 months.|$|R
50|$|More recent renovations in 2001 and 2005, {{in which}} luxury boxes {{replaced}} bleacher seating {{in the higher}} rows of the grandstands, reduced the stadium capacity to 37,317 in 2001, and to its current 35,650 in 2005. In 2007, Calgary Stampeders president Ted Hellard proposed a further reduction of the stadium's capacity by approximately 4,200 seats to accommodate further luxury boxes, with renovations to be underwritten with personal <b>seat</b> <b>licenses.</b>|$|R

Plaintiff, a New York Giants season ticketholder, sued the team because it required season ticketholders, who wished to continue to purchase season tickets in the New Meadowlands Stadium, to purchase a personal <b>seat</b> <b>license</b> (PSL), which costs up to $20,000 a seat, {{on top of the}} cost of the season tickets themselves."N.Y.

5000|$|On January 29, 2016, the Rams and Chargers {{came to an}} {{agreement}} in principle to share the stadium. The Chargers would contribute a $200 million stadium loan from the NFL and personal <b>seat</b> <b>license</b> fees to the construction costs and would pay $1 per year in rent to the Rams. The same day, Chargers chairman-CEO Dean Spanos announced the team would remain in San Diego for the 2016 NFL season, while continuing to work with local government on a new stadium. Measure C (the Chargers stadium proposal) did not receive the requisite number of votes required for passage.|$|E
5000|$|Home side seating is {{available}} with {{the purchase of}} a personal <b>seat</b> <b>license</b> fee for premium seating at games, which finances part of the stadium's construction. Fans can purchase up to four of approximately 5,500 licenses for seats between the 30-yard line and each end zone with a minimum $250 annual donation to the athletic department or between the 30-yard lines on either side of midfield for $1,500 each year, plus the cost of season tickets. Approximately 200 premium [...] "White Gold Tier" [...] seats, intended primarily for purchase by corporations, are also available for an undisclosed amount. As of January 2013, 600 seat licenses remained unsold.|$|E
25|$|The Super Bowl {{has been}} used as an {{incentive}} by the league to convince local governments, businesses, and voters to support the construction, <b>seat</b> <b>licenses</b> and taxes associated with new or renovated stadiums.

50|$|When the Raiders {{moved back}} from Los Angeles in 1995, {{the city of}} Oakland and the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Authority agreed to sell Personal <b>Seat</b> <b>Licenses</b> (PSLs) {{to help pay for}} the renovations to their stadium. But after games rarely sold out, the Raiders filed suit, {{claiming}} that they were misled by the city and the Coliseum Authority with the false promise that there would be sellouts. On November 2, 2005, a settlement was announced, part of which was the abolishment of PSLs as of the 2006 season.|$|R

In June of that year, Richardson Sports announced that they would finance the stadium through the sale of Permanent <b>Seat</b> <b>Licenses,</b> club <b>seats,</b> and luxury boxes. In a stunning show of fan support, all seats were sold out {{by the end of the}} first day.|$|R
