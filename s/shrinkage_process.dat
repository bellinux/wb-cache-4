Here, two compositional changes for the reduction of shrinkage in an acrylamide-based photopolymer are reported.

Firstly, the effect of the replacement of the acrylamide monomer in the photopolymer composition with a larger monomer molecule, diacetone acrylamide, on polymerisation-induced shrinkage has been studied.

The second method tested for shrinkage reduction involved the incorporation of BEA-type zeolite nanoparticles in the acrylamide-based photopolymer.

After a short review of the main causes and consequences of urban shrinkage in Europe, two common public policy responses are identified and evaluated: counteracting shrinkage and accepting shrinkage.

In shrinking environments, however, people are not always prepared to engage for their community. If policymakers want citizens to care for their community, they must enable them to do so.

This results in a progressive reduction in neuroblast cell size and ultimately in terminal differentiation.

The evolution of their microstructure was studied using impedance spectroscopy, whose results were contrasted with mercury intrusion porosimetry. The hardening environment {{has an influence on}} the microstructure of fly ash cement mortars. On one hand, the impedance resistances R 1 and R 2 are more influenced by the drying of the materials than by microstructure development, so they are not suitable for following the evolution of the porous network under non-optimum conditions.

The first analysis is based on a long-time approach of demographic, economic and social changes in the three urban areas (Beauregard, 2009).

Patients and Methods: patients with a complete CTA follow-up of 2 years and a primary shrinking aneurysm were included, resulting in a study group of 29 patients. Six functions, logarithmic, exponential and linear, all with and without lag time, were fitted to the thrombus volume obtained from measurements postoperative and after 6, 12 and 24 months. The correlation coefficient was used to determine the association between the calculated and measured values. A correlation coefficient > 0. 95 was considered a good fit. Results : a logarithmic model produced the best fits. From the 29 patients, two patients could not be described by any model. The remaining 27 patients could be fitted using a logarithmic function with a correlation coefficient of > 0. 95 (median 0. 99, range 0. 95 – 1. 00).
