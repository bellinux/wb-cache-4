5|$|As the Doctor is a pacifist {{and did not}} use {{the guns}} {{commonly}} found in video games, The Adventure Games utilised a more strategy and puzzle-based gameplay. Much of the first game was based around stealth, exploration, and puzzle-solving. The Doctor was also equipped with his sonic <b>screwdriver,</b> but as this was often used as a skeleton key in the show the game employs the solving of puzzles to advance instead of simply using the <b>screwdriver.</b>|$|E
5|$|May 21: Physicist Louis Slotin {{receives}} a fatal {{dose of radiation}} (2100 rems) when the <b>screwdriver</b> he was using to keep two beryllium hemispheres apart slips.|$|E
5|$|In Elton's {{concluding}} narrative, Ursula's {{voice is}} heard {{and it is}} revealed that the Doctor {{was able to use}} his sonic <b>screwdriver</b> to keep Ursula's essence alive in a paving stone, which Elton now keeps in his room.|$|E
50|$|Torque <b>screwdrivers</b> are {{available}} with several types of clutch, including “cam-over”, “cushion clutch”, and “auto shutoff”. Most of these clutch types are used in electric <b>screwdrivers,</b> air <b>screwdrivers,</b> impulse <b>screwdrivers,</b> manual torque <b>screwdrivers,</b> and cordless torque <b>screwdrivers.</b> Each type {{has the ability to}} preset a specified torque value. In some cases a tool may need to be certified in a calibration lab to verify its torque output; a certificate may be issued by an organisation such as NIST in the USA.|$|R
50|$|A {{torque tester}} {{is used as}} a quality control device to test or {{calibrate}} torque controlled tools. This includes electronic torque wrenches, click torque wrenches, dial torque wrenches, electric <b>screwdrivers,</b> air <b>screwdrivers,</b> pulse tools, cordless <b>screwdrivers,</b> nutrunners, and torque <b>screwdrivers.</b> Today’s advanced torque testers include the ability to measure in clockwise and counter-clockwise directions, convert to 8 engineering units (in·oz, in·lb, ft·lb, N·m, cN·m, kgf·cm, gf·cm, kgf·fm), 3 modes of operation (peak, 1st peak, track), and include a National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) certificate (or its domestic pendant).|$|R
50|$|Interchangeable bits {{allow the}} use of powered <b>screwdrivers,</b> {{commonly}} using an electric or air motor to rotate the bit. Cordless drills with speed and torque control are commonly used as power <b>screwdrivers.</b>|$|R
5|$|The rifle had {{normally}} {{been used}} to shoot rabbits with the silencer and telescopic sight attached. The court heard that the telescopic sight {{had to be removed}} with a <b>screwdriver,</b> but it was usually left in place because it was time-consuming to realign it. Nevill's nephew visited the farmhouse on the weekend of 26–28 July 1985, and told the court that he had seen the rifle, in the gun cupboard in the ground-floor office, with the sight and silencer attached. He had taken the gun out and used it for target practice.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{finds his}} changes to Kazran's past have locked him {{out from the}} spire's controls, but the Doctor devises a solution: by having Abigail sing through {{one half of the}} broken sonic <b>screwdriver,</b> the other half, still in the shark, will {{resonate}} in the atmosphere and disrupt the storm to allow the ship to land safely. Kazran releases Abigail knowing this will be the last time, but Abigail understands and believes it is time for them to share a Christmas Day. The plan works successfully, and the resulting cloud break-out creates snowfall that falls around the city. As the Doctor rejoins Amy and Rory and prepares to take young Kazran back to the past, old Kazran and Abigail enjoy one last shark-led carriage-ride together.|$|E
5|$|The {{frustration}} at #1 Records obstructed sales contributed to tension within the band. There was physical fighting between members: Bell, after being {{punched in the}} face by Hummel, retaliated by smashing Hummel's new bass guitar to pieces against the wall. Hummel took revenge at a later date: finding Bell's acoustic guitar in the latter's unattended car, he repeatedly punched it with a <b>screwdriver.</b> In November 1972, Bell quit the band. When work continued on songs for a second album, Bell rejoined, but further conflict soon erupted. A master tape of the new songs inexplicably went missing, and Bell, whose heavy drug intake was affecting his judgment, attacked Fry's parked car. In late 1972, struggling with severe depression, Bell quit the band once more, {{and by the end}} of the year Big Star disbanded.|$|E
50|$|<b>Screwdrivers</b> are available—manual, electric, and pneumatic—with {{a clutch}} that slips at a preset torque. This helps the user tighten screws to a {{specified}} torque without damage or over-tightening. Cordless drills designed {{to use as}} <b>screwdrivers</b> often have such a clutch.|$|R

5|$|After the war, Schreiber {{remained}} at Los Alamos, {{where he became}} a group leader in the Weapon (W) Division. His first assignment was to ready bombs for the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific. During the preparations, he witnessed the accident in which Louis Slotin was exposed to a fatal dose of neutron radiation when a <b>screwdriver</b> Slotin was using during a criticality experiment {{with one of the}} plutonium pits for Operation Crossroads slipped and the core went critical. Slotin would die from radiation poisoning nine days later but his quick reaction saved the lives of Schreiber and the others in the room (see also: demon core). Schreiber became an exponent of remote handling of dangerous substances, and designed remote-control machines to perform such experiments with all personnel at a quarter-mile distance.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Rose deduces {{that she}} and Mickey were kept alive because their touch can {{activate}} the Genesis Ark. Dalek Sec explains that they cannot open the Ark because it is stolen Time Lord technology. He demands that Rose open it, but she refuses and mocks the Daleks until the Doctor arrives. The Doctor realises that these Daleks are the enigmatic Cult of Skaro, and uses his sonic <b>screwdriver</b> to allow the Cybermen into the sphere chamber. As the Cybermen attack the Daleks, Mickey accidentally activates the Ark while escaping. The Daleks battle the Cybermen and Dalek Sec takes the Ark outside. The Doctor and his companions flee into the tower. Along the way, Pete saves Jackie from the Cybermen and the two embrace. The Doctor then takes everyone to the control room where they witness the Genesis Ark open and millions of Daleks that were imprisoned during the Time War pour out and begin engaging the Cybermen firing on them from below, though humanity is {{caught in the crossfire}} and many are killed while running for cover.|$|E
5|$|Ranger's 9-foot {{prototype}} of the product, with plenty of right angles and shiny black Micarta skin, was bulky, imposing, and visually unattractive. Arnold Wolf was called in as the industrial design consultant to this project in early 1957. Wolf, who would later become {{president and chief executive}} of JBL, was initially asked to produce a shell version for dealers' shops. Due to transportation and installation constraints, it was decided that the speaker would be split into three components – the left and right channel enclosures, and the curved radiator panel – that could be easily re-assembled with a <b>screwdriver.</b> To support the weight and prevent deforming, the design called for six feet, of which four are height-adjustable. Instead of producing detailed drawings, Wolf worked with scale models. First, he created a 1:4 model in plastic, after which he made others. He ended with a 1:12 scale model that would show how it could be disassembled and reassembled. During the design phase, the relationship between Wolf and Ranger became very tense, and the project nearly collapsed. The parties came together over the month of June, and agreed on the definitive production specification for the Paragon. This would be a 2-way design.|$|E

50|$|Cushion clutch or “slip clutch” {{styles are}} found in both {{electric}} <b>screwdrivers</b> and air <b>screwdrivers.</b> This clutch style {{is similar to the}} “cam-over” when once the final torque is reached because the clutch continues to cam over and slip. It will continue to run until the operator releases the throttle.|$|R

5|$|The Doctor and Donna, {{neither one}} {{aware of the}} other's involvement, both {{investigate}} Adipose Industries, which is marketing a special diet pill {{to the people of}} London. They find that the pill's slogan, The Fat Just Walks Away, is literal. The pills use latent body fat to parthenogenetically create small white aliens called Adipose that spawn at night and leave the host's body. The Doctor and Donna separately infiltrate the offices of Adipose Industries, each unaware that the other is there. Donna hides out in a toilet cubicle until they close, the Doctor stays in a storage room. As they explore the building, they suddenly encounter each other through opposite windows in an office. They are confronted by Miss Foster, an alien who is using Britain's overweight population to create the Adipose babies for the Adiposian First Family. Miss Foster pursues the Doctor and Donna around the building, finally catching them in an office. She tells the Doctor that the Adipose lost their breeding planet and hired Miss Foster to find a replacement. The Doctor uses Miss Foster's sonic pen and his sonic <b>screwdriver</b> to create a diversion and escape.|$|E
25|$|The Twelfth Doctor {{loses his}} sonic <b>screwdriver</b> to {{the creator of}} the Daleks, Davros, after lending it to him when he was a child. In the last episode of Series 9, the Doctor {{received}} a new sonic <b>screwdriver</b> from the TARDIS in place of the temporary sonic glasses.|$|E
25|$|One of the zombie {{units in}} this game is called Dr. Spacetime. The {{character}} makes several references to Doctor Who, including a wardrobe that resembles the TARDIS, a <b>screwdriver</b> referencing the sonic <b>screwdriver,</b> and a scarf and bow tie reminiscent of the Fourth and Second or Eleventh Doctors, respectively.|$|E

50|$|A rundown fixture, {{also known}} as a joint simulator, is used during the {{calibration}} process to help test power tools (electric <b>screwdrivers,</b> air <b>screwdrivers,</b> pulse tools, cordless <b>screwdrivers,</b> nutrunners, etc.). A joint simulator is placed on top of the transducers. An adapter bit is inserted into the power tool and is mated to top of the joint simulator. By using springs of different stiffness or stacking Belleville washers in set patterns, the joint simulator can replicate soft, medium, or hard joints. This is important when trying to repeat how a tool may be used on an actual process.|$|R

25|$|Six tools (a pair of scissors, two knives, a <b>screwdriver,</b> an {{oscillating}} saw and a hammer) {{were recovered}} outside Magnotta's apartment and analysed by ballistics expert Gilbert Desjardins. He said none could be definitively {{linked to the}} killing, and no skeletal marks suggested the <b>screwdriver</b> or scissors were used, but some were consistent with saw and knife or X-Acto blade injuries.|$|E

25|$|After another arrest, Bakırköy Psychiatric Hospital again {{found him}} to have diminished responsibility. He stayed in a mental {{hospital}} for treatment lasting about one year. Following his release, he continued with his murders. He killed three people and injured two more severely with a <b>screwdriver</b> in Çorlu. Late at night, he went first to the Çorluspor facility, and murdered nightman Hüseyin Yumruk with a <b>screwdriver.</b> Then, he skewered Özcan Karagözoğlu in an industrial zone. Finally, he killed Şakir Temüriçi, whom he met on the street. He threw the bodies in a hole. In the early morning hours, he went in Tonguçlar Mosque, wounded the imam, Salih Baş, in his neck with a <b>screwdriver,</b> and escaped.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the programme, {{there have}} been many {{different}} versions of the sonic <b>screwdriver,</b> as with subsequent Doctors the design of it was changed. It has also been destroyed on a number of occasions, thus leading to the introduction of the next model. Not all iterations of the Doctor have used the sonic <b>screwdriver</b> on screen; the Fifth Doctor in fact opted not to replace his after it was destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Shake-the-box kits are simple, easy-to-assemble kits; {{a freight}} car might include a {{one-piece}} body, a chassis, trucks, couplers, and a weight, while a structure kit might include walls, windows, doors, and glazing. The name {{derives from the}} joke that no skill was required – you shake the box, and the kit falls together. A common synonym is <b>screwdriver</b> kit as many kits can be assembled with a <b>screwdriver</b> and tweezers.|$|E
