5|$|Burnout 3: Takedown is {{a racing}} video game {{developed}} by Criterion Games {{and published by}} Electronic Arts. It is the third instalment in the Burnout series, which is characterised by fast-paced arcade racing. A staple of the series {{is the use of}} boost, earned through risky driving, to rapidly increase a car's speed. The central mechanic introduced in Burnout 3 is Takedowns, which allow players to slam their opponents until they crash. Takedowns work in conjunction with the boost system by filling up and extending the boost meter. Aside from <b>standard</b> <b>circuit</b> races, the game features modes focused on performing Takedowns on rival vehicles and causing monetary damage at a junction occupied with traffic. Each game variant is featured in a single-player campaign mode called World Tour, which serves as the primary method for unlocking new and faster cars. The game supports both online and split-screen multiplayer.|$|E
5|$|Burnout 3: Takedown is {{a racing}} video game with arcade-style {{gameplay}} that emphasises dangerous and fast-paced driving. The game features <b>standard</b> <b>circuit</b> races which {{take place on}} carriageways and city streets populated with traffic. The Single Race mode pits the player against five AI opponents in a single or multiple lap race. During a race, boost, which is earned by acts of reckless driving such as drifting around corners, near misses with traffic, and driving in oncoming lanes, {{can be used to}} rapidly increase a car's speed. Boost can be used immediately in Burnout 3, unlike previous Burnout games which required the boost meter to be full. The quickest method for earning boost is a Takedown—a central mechanic introduced in this instalment of the series. A Takedown involves shunting opposing vehicles until they crash. Each one fills the boost meter and can provide an additional boost segment, causing the meter to extend up to four times its initial size. Ramming opponents will cause them to behave more aggressively in return; their level of hostility is indicated by a coloured arrow above their vehicle. When the player crashes or is taken out by an opponent, boost is lost and a bonus boost segment is withdrawn. During the crash sequence, a slow-motion mode called Impact Time can be activated. In Impact Time, the Aftertouch mechanic can be used to manoeuvre the wrecked car chassis into an opponent to get a Takedown, which acts as recovery move by negating the penalty of crashing.|$|E
25|$|With {{advances}} in power semiconductors, it became possible to output high voltage {{directly from the}} output stage of the amplifier. For example, in 1967, Crown International introduced the DC300 amplifier, which is capable of directly driving 70-volt lines, as well as traditional speaker loads, thanks to its overall power of 500W. In 1987, Crown introduced the Macrotech 2400, capable of driving 100-volt lines directly. Since that time, further developments in high-power amplifier technology have widened the choices; many manufacturers make amplifiers capable of direct connection to a high-impedance constant-voltage speaker line. High-voltage audio amplifiers have almost become a one chip solution. For example, National Semiconductor's LME49810 (and similar products LME49811 and LME49830) can output 100 V peak to peak signals, but have relatively low current output, so a <b>standard</b> <b>circuit</b> includes a Darlington or FET discrete output stage.|$|E

2500|$|They {{can also}} be found in power {{supplies}} for digital circuits, where they are used as a sort of [...] "enhanced circuit breaker" [...] to prevent a failure in the power supply from damaging downstream components. A thyristor is used in conjunction with a Zener diode attached to its gate, and if the output voltage of the supply rises above the Zener voltage, the thyristor will conduct and short-circuit the power supply output to ground (in general also tripping an upstream breaker or fuse). This kind of protection circuit is known as a crowbar, and has the advantage over a <b>standard</b> <b>circuit</b> breaker or fuse in that it creates a high-conductance path to ground for the damaging supply voltage and potentially for stored energy in the system being powered.|$|E

There are multiple ways to simulate Chua's diode using such components. One standard design is realized by connecting two negative impedance converters in parallel. A negative impedance converter (NIC) is a simple op amp circuit that has negative resistance. Another implementation uses one negative impedance converter to create the negative resistance characteristic, and a diode-resistor network to create the nonlinear characteristic.|$|E

50|$|The circuit is classed {{as private}} {{property}} and is not open for general practice. The circuit only stages a handful of race meetings per year, usually run by Salop Motor Club, or with assistance from the Salop Motor Club. Most events are open for amateur racers registered with either the AMCA or ACU governing bodies, {{although some of the}} higher profile events are limited to National championship riders or professional international riders. Generally the circuit is seen as one of the toughest in the UK, and is not recommended for a novice, especially in its Grand Prix format. The deep sand and bumpy surface sap the energy of even the best riders and to ride at speed around the circuit takes {{a lot of hard work}} and concentration.However the circuit is picturesque, and provides a rare opportunity for amateur riders to ride on an International <b>standard</b> <b>circuit.</b>|$|E
50|$|Modern alarm {{controls}} are solid-state devices, {{and do not}} use the relays that the older alarm panels used to go into alarm. They make use of relays to modulate the alarm notification device as needed. And they use a relay to seize the telephone line to communicate to the monitoring station. Most switching devices are N.C. (normally closed) circuits, so when the device is not in an alarm condition, the circuit is closed. Most alarm circuits (zones) are also set up to open or close on reading a certain resistance, usually between 1K and 5K ohms when inactive and double the value when active. This wiring system is called dual loop and allows for both alarm and anti-tamper detections to be incorporated into one circuit (anti-tamper occurs when the resistance level moves outside normal open/close values).

5000|$|The <b>standard</b> <b>circuit</b> {{begins with}} a roll on the runway until the {{aircraft}} rotates (nose pitches up), a climb to 500 feet above runway/field elevation (AGL), a right or left climbing turn (depending on making either right hand or left hand circuits) to a course perpendicular to the runway, continuing to gain altitude to TPA (traffic pattern altitude) (typically 1000 feet AGL), followed by another right or left turn for a downwind leg parallel to the runway, maintaining TPA. During the downwind leg the pilot performs pre-landing checks, contacts the control tower requesting a full-stop landing, a touch-and-go, [...] "stop-and-go", or [...] "the option", and when cleared to land, descends to 800 feet AGL. After seeing {{the threshold of the}} runway at 45 degrees behind him/her, the pilot makes another descending left or right turn to 500 feet AGL.

50|$|The {{importance}} of radar in World War II gave a great impetus to waveguide research, {{at least on}} the Allied side. The magnetron developed in 1940 by John Randall and Harry Boot at the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom provided a good power source and made microwave radars feasible. The most important centre of research was at the Radiation Laboratory (Rad Lab) at MIT but many others took part in the US, and in the UK such as the Telecommunications Research Establishment. The head of the Fundamental Development Group at Rad Lab was Edward Mills Purcell. His researchers included Julian Schwinger, Nathan Marcuvitz, Carol Gray Montgomery, and Robert H. Dicke. Much of the Rad Lab work concentrated on finding lumped element models of waveguide structures so that components in waveguide could be analysed with <b>standard</b> <b>circuit</b> theory. Hans Bethe was also briefly at Rad Lab, but while there he produced his small aperture theory which proved important for waveguide cavity filters, first developed at Rad Lab. The German side, on the other hand, largely ignored the potential of waveguides in radar until very late in the war. So much so that when radar parts from a downed British plane were sent to Siemens & Halske for analysis, even though they were recognised as microwave components, their purpose could not be identified.German academics were even allowed to continue publicly publishing their research in this field because it was not felt to be important.|$|E
40|$|A leakage-tolerant design {{technique}} for high fan-in dynamic logic circuits is presented.
