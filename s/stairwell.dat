5000|$|In the {{original}} building, <b>stairwells</b> were also sited {{at either end}} of the central [...] "shotgun" [...] hallway. These were closed off during the 1986-1991 restoration. Additional <b>stairwells</b> were sited at the ends of the wings, again to conform to building codes.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} two {{low-level}} island platforms and two high-level island platforms. Trains are accessed by entering wooden <b>stairwells</b> on the platforms. Tracks 1 and 8 are not usable {{due to the}} lack of <b>stairwells</b> on them, as the M3, M7, and C3 railcars do not have steps fixed to them.|$|R

5|$|Car types include coaches, dining cars, lounges, and {{sleeping}} cars. Most passenger spaces {{are on the}} upper level, which features a row of windows on both sides. The Sightseer Lounge observation cars have distinctive floor-to-ceiling windows on the upper level. Boarding is on the lower level; passengers climb up a center <b>stairwell</b> to access the upper level.|$|E
5|$|Internally, {{a number}} of rooms feature period wall and ceiling decorations {{including}} the entrance hall, which dates from the original 1730s building and features moulded panelling and cornices, a marble fireplace and ornamental plaster ceiling and an arabesque frieze. The <b>stairwell</b> is lit from above with a roof light and features a cantilevered stair with iron balusters from the 1825 adaptation with a later brass handrail.|$|E

5|$|The lack {{of skilled}} craftspeople in Northumberland made the {{construction}} of the house difficult. For example, Richardson speculates that the main staircase was assembled from a kit. It is one step too short for the Northumberland hallway, but no extra step was added to finish off the symmetry of the <b>stairwell,</b> suggesting a dearth of skilled labor.|$|E
5|$|Together with a {{simultaneous}} {{attack on the}} Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and a failed plane hijacking {{that resulted in a}} plane crash in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, the attacks resulted in the deaths of 2,996 people (2,507 civilians, 343 firefighters, 72 law enforcement officers, 55 military personnel, and the 19 hijackers). More than 90% of the workers and visitors who died in the towers had been at or above the points of impact. In the North Tower, 1,355 people at or above the point of impact were trapped, and died of smoke inhalation, fell, jumped from the tower to escape the smoke and flames, or were killed when the building eventually collapsed. One <b>stairwell</b> in the South Tower, <b>Stairwell</b> A, somehow avoided complete destruction, unlike the rest of the building. When Flight 11 hit, all three staircases in the North Tower above the impact zone were destroyed, thus making it impossible for anyone above the impact zone to escape. 107 people below the point of impact also died.|$|E
5|$|Upon opening, {{the house}} {{featured}} two dining rooms with student rooms arranged along lengthy hallways radiating {{from the center}} of the structure. The nine tower floors were only accessible via the ground level, from the dorm's primary entrance hall. An exterior fire escape led down the back of Jewett's tower but was replaced with an interior <b>stairwell</b> during the 2003 renovation.|$|E

50|$|The site shows {{physical}} evidence of typical Frankish construction with stone <b>stairwells,</b> large halls and arched ceilings, {{which may have}} been part of an 11th-century fortified agricultural settlement together with nearby Tzippori (Sephoris/Dioceserea). The architecture, whilst having much in common with concurrent strongholds of the Ayyubid period, has distinct Crusader features, such as the arch-free flat-roofed <b>stairwells.</b>|$|R
500|$|Along {{with the}} {{protection}} {{provided by the}} reinforced concrete base, {{a number of other}} safety features were included in the building's design, so that it would be prepared for a major accident or terrorist attack. Like 7 World Trade Center, the building has [...] thick reinforced concrete walls in all <b>stairwells,</b> elevator shafts, risers, and sprinkler systems. There are also extra-wide, pressurized <b>stairwells,</b> along with a dedicated set of <b>stairwells</b> exclusively for the use of firefighters, and biological and chemical filters throughout the ventilation system. In comparison, the original Twin Towers used a purely steel central core to house utility functions, protected only by lightweight drywall panels.|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{exterior}} devastation {{caused by the}} bow's descent and collision with the ocean floor, {{there are parts of}} the interior in reasonably good condition. The bow's slow flooding and its relatively smooth descent to the sea floor mitigated interior damage. The <b>stairwell</b> of the First-Class Grand Staircase between the Boat Deck and E Deck is an empty chasm within the wreck, providing a convenient point of access for ROVs. Dense rusticles hanging from the steel decking combined with the deep layers of silt that have accumulated in the interior make navigating the wreck disorienting.|$|E
5|$|In February {{after one}} round of drink service, three men were denied further service at Sixteen {{due to their}} {{apparent}} intoxication and as a payback, the three pulled what {{was intended to be}} a prank. They set off fire alarms and opened a fifth-floor <b>stairwell</b> Chicago Fire Department standpipe valve and flooded elevator shafts with thousands of gallons of water and damaged woodwork, electrical circuitry and marble. The resulting damage was estimated at $700,000 and the three faced felony criminal damage to property charges.|$|E
5|$|The Glidden barn is of {{pole and}} beam construction. The second-floor {{interior}} {{is dominated by}} two large transverse wooden beams. It is of the three-bay, English tradition, the west bay containing a space for a <b>stairwell</b> leading to a hayloft and seven stalls. It is constructed of red brick and stands on a foundation of limestone. Glidden's barn took {{full advantage of the}} term vernacular; the brick was locally manufactured and the limestone locally quarried.|$|E

5|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was finally}} built in 1862 and first lit officially on 1 May 1862. It {{was designed by}} Alexander Dawson, the New South Wales Government Architect at that time, with a flared base and an external <b>stairwell,</b> an unusual feature for lighthouses in the time and area. The lighthouse keepers' cottages were also unique, built in Victorian Gothic style, with both the principal keeper and the two assistants sharing the same roof and a combined terrace.|$|E
5|$|At around 20:30, Goebbels and Magda {{left the}} bunker {{and walked up}} to the garden of the Chancellery, where they {{committed}} suicide. There are several different accounts of this event. According to one account, Goebbels shot Magda and then himself. Another account was that they each bit on a cyanide ampule and were given a coup de grâce immediately afterwards. Goebbels' SS adjutant Günther Schwägermann testified in 1948 that they walked ahead of him up the stairs and out into the Chancellery garden. He waited in the <b>stairwell</b> and heard the shots sound. Schwägermann then walked up the remaining stairs and, once outside, saw their lifeless bodies. Following Goebbels' prior order, Schwägermann had an SS soldier fire several shots into his body, which did not move.|$|E
5|$|Council House is {{constructed}} from concrete-encased steel frame, with lifts and service rooms located at its eastern end and a fire escape <b>stairwell</b> at its western end. Level 9 houses the distinctive circular Council Chamber, which features wood panelling {{and has been}} restored to largely its original state in the 1990s refurbishment (by contrast {{to most of the}} other levels of the building). The building is almost completely clad with glass, which led to criticism about its excessive air conditioning costs. The glass exterior of the building has T-shaped white sunbreakers superimposed in an alternating pattern across the building, coated with fine mosaic tiles. With the newly enclosed top floor, the building now has 13 levels above ground.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} {{hour of the}} fire it spread onto the 23rd and 24th floors. Heavy smoke was {{building}} up in the stairwells and a captain and two firefighters from Engine 11 were assigned {{to go to the}} top level to ventilate the <b>stairwell.</b> The three firefighters went up a center staircase from the 22nd floor and soon radioed that they were disoriented by heavy smoke on the 30th floor. There were attempts to direct the firefighters through the radio, and soon after the captain requested permission to break a window for ventilation, which was followed by a message that the captain was down. Permission to break the window was given and a search and rescue effort was initiated.|$|E
5|$|Hearing noise, Mulder heads {{outside and}} {{witnesses}} a UFO flying overhead; inside, small beings run past Scully. Cars full of armed soldiers arrive, forcing the agents to flee. The agents meet with Skinner at a diner in rural Maryland. Skinner wants {{to turn over}} the tape in exchange for their reinstatement and safety. After initially objecting, Mulder agrees to let Skinner turn the tape over. Skinner heads to see Melissa in the hospital and is told by Albert of the mysterious blue-suited man outside. Skinner chases the man to a <b>stairwell</b> where he is attacked by Alex Krycek and Luis Cardinal, who beat him unconscious and steal the tape.|$|E
5|$|Internally, {{the south}} range {{includes}} three 16th- or early-17th-century stone fireplaces that {{have probably been}} reused from the earlier house. The north room of the attic floor and principal room {{on the first floor}} include 16th- or early-17th-century timber panelling. The room over the entrance hall features late-17th-century panelling. Two period staircases feature; one from each of the 16th and 17th centuries. The windows in the entrance hall and north room of the east range include armorial stained glass windows dated 1567, 1567 and 1575. The <b>stairwell</b> includes windows with 17th-century German stained glass taken from the adjacent church of St Peter and other, undated stained glass.|$|E
