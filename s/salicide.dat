The resistivity can be lowered by increasing the level of doping, but even highly doped polysilicon is not as conductive as most metals.

40|$|An {{investigation}} of in situ cobalt self-aligned silicide (<b>salicide)</b> formation {{has been carried}} out with emphasis on the effect of the deposition temperature and the role of nitrogen atoms in the sputtering ambient. The cobalt (Co) layer was deposited at between 300 and 500 °C in a mixed atmosphere of nitrogen and argon; the nitrogen volume percent [N, vol-ume percent (v/o) ] was varied from 0 to 10 %. The addition of nitrogen atoms to the sputtering ambient resulted in a poly-morphic change of the Co layer which was deposited on the SiO, substrate; from a-Co to 3 -Co. At the same time, it lim-ited the surface mobility of the sputtered atoms, resulting in a decrease of grain size. Specifically, during Co deposition on a Si substrate at temperatures as high as 500 °C, in situ cobalt silicide (CoSi) was formed. In that process, nitrogen atoms limited the available Co atoms involved in the reaction with the Si substrate, yielding the bilayer formation of 3 -Co/CoSi.
