40|$|The {{method to}} improve compact subsoil is very {{important}} to the soil fertility. This is because agriculture since the second world war has been through a lot of changes, and today bigger and heavier machines are used. In this work the ability of different plant species to penetrate soil and stabilize soil structure was <b>screened.</b> <b>Barley</b> (Hordeum vulgare, L.), lupine (Lupinus luteus, L.) and lucerne (Medicago sativa, L.) were grown in tubes. The soil in the tubes was compacted to create two different compaction levels, by applying pressures of 100 kPa and 400 kPa, respectively. After a growth period of five weeks and three months respectively, root length and saturated hydraulic conductivity were measured. Lucerne had a greater ability to establish root systems in compact soil compared to barley. Saturated hydraulic conductivity of the tubes was not very different between plant species. The laboratory method show on different abilities between species to penetrate compact soil. The method had some limitations in its ability to detect soil structural changes, but this can probably be overcome by small changes in the setup of the method...|$|E
40|$|Variability {{in growth}} and {{sporulation}} of five isolates of Arthrobotrys dactyloides was studied on five agar, 6 bran and 5 grain media. Potato dextrose agar (PDA) supported maximum growth of isolate A, C and E, while growth of isolate B and D {{was significantly lower}} on this medium. On Czapek’s agar and yeast glucose agar media the differentiation in the isolates in relation to growth was poor than PDA. The other two media showed much poorer differentiation. On Czapek’s agar medium, sporulation was recorded in isolate B only, whereas other isolates showed rare sporulation. Among the bran media, pea bran agar medium supported maximum growth of all the isolates except isolate B. Gram and rice bran agar media were next best. However, the growth of isolate B on the gram bran agar medium {{was more or less}} equal as other isolates. On pigeon pea bran agar medium, isolate E failed to grow while other isolates recorded poor growth. On lentil bran agar medium, only isolate B and D recorded little growth, whereas other isolates failed to grow. All the isolates recorded good sporulation on bran agar media except pigeon pea and lentil bran agar media. The grain agar media supported moderate to very good growth of all the isolates. In general isolate B remained slow growing on these media except gram grain and sorghum grain agar media on which growth of this isolate was comparable to other isolates. Sporulation in general, was good on all the grain agar media. Among different substrates <b>screened,</b> <b>barley</b> grain and pea bran were found superior to others for mass culture of isolate A of A. dactyloides...|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of chlorophyll fluorescence measurements to <b>screening</b> <b>barley</b> (Hordeum vulgare L.) genotypes for salinity tolerance has been investigated. Excised barley leaves were cut under water and incubated with the cut end immersed in water or in a 100 -mM NaCl solution, {{either in the}} dark or in high light. Changes in rapid fluorescence kinetics occurred in excised barley leaves exposed to the saline solution only when the incubation {{was carried out in}} the presence of high light. Fluorescence changes consisted of decreases in the variable to maximum fluorescence ratio and in increases in the relative proportion of variable fluorescence leading to point I in the Kautsky fluorescence induction curve. These relative increases in fluorescence at point I appeared to arise from a delayed plastoquinone reoxidation in the dark, since they disappeared after short, far-red illumination, which is known to excite photosystem I preferentially. We show that a significant correlation existed between some fluorescence parameters, measured after a combined salt and high-light treatment, and other independent measurements of salinity tolerance. These results suggest that chlorophyll fluorescence, and especially the relative fluorescence at point I in the Kautsky fluorescence induction curve, could be used for the <b>screening</b> of <b>barley</b> genotypes for salinity tolerance.

40|$|In flag {{leaves of}} four cultivars of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) {{grown in the}} field under a triple-line-source {{sprinkler}} system, that produces a linear soil salinity gradient, a decrease in net carbon dioxide assimilation rate (P(N)) and stomatal conductance for water vapour (g(s)) was found. These changes were related to salinity tolerance at moderate salinity. With increasing salinity, P(N) was saturated at low irradiances and stomatal frequencies increased. A decrease in photosystem 2 (PS 2) efficiency was {{not found in the}} field after dark adaptation even at high salinity. Salinity induced only small decreases in the actual PS 2 efficiency at midday steady-state photosynthesis, indicating that the photosynthetic electron transport was little affected by salinity. Therefore, using PS 2 efficiency estimates in attached leaves is probably not a useful tool to <b>screen</b> <b>barley</b> genotypes grown under saline conditions in the field for salinity tolerance. In contrast, excised flag leaves from high salinity plots, once in the laboratory, exhibited a decrease in the variable to maximum chlorophyll fluorescence ratio as compared to excised leaves from control plants.

40|$|Waterlogging {{can reduce}} crop yield by 20 - 50 % or more, {{and lack of}} {{efficient}} selection methods is an obstacle in plant breeding. The methods currently used are mainly indices based on germination ability in Petri dishes and leaf chlorosis in plants grown in waterlogged soils. Cultivation in oxygen-depleted nutrient solution is the ultimate waterlogging system. Therefore methods based on root growth inhibition and on fluorescence in plant material hydroponically grown in oxygen-depleted solution were evaluated against data on biomass growthbiomass accumulation in waterlogged soils. Both traits were correlated with waterlogging tolerance in soil, but since {{it was easier to}} measure fluorescence, this method was further evaluated. A selection of F 2 plants with high and low fluorescence revealed a small but significant screening effect in F 3 plants. A test of 175 Nordic cultivars showed large variations in chlorophyll fluorescence in leaves from oxygen-stressed seedlings, indicating that adaptation to waterlogging has gradually improved over the past 40 - 50 years with the introduction of new cultivars onto the market. However, precipitation also increased during the period and new cultivars may have inadvertently been adapted to this while breeding barley for grain yield. The results suggest that the hydroponic method can be used for <b>screening</b> <b>barley</b> populations, breeding lines or phenotyping of populations in developing markers for quantitative trait loci...|$|R

Sucrose:fructan 6 -fructosyltransferase (6 -SFT), an enzyme catalyzing the formation and extension of beta- 2, 6 -linked fructans typical of grasses, was purified from barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). It occurred in two closely similar isoforms with indistinguishable catalytic properties, both consisting of two subunits with apparent masses of 49 and 23 kDa.

Here we are interested in the design of overlapping oligonucleotide (overgo) probes from large unigene (EST-contigs) datasets. Results OLIGOSPAWN is a suite of software tools that offers two complementary services, namely (1) the selection of "unique" oligos each of which appears in one unigene but does not occur (exactly or approximately) in any other and (2) the selection of "popular" oligos each of which occurs (exactly or approximately) in as many unigenes as possible. In this paper, we describe the functionalities of OLIGOSPAWN and the computational methods it employs, and we report on experimental results for the overgo probes designed with it. Conclusion The algorithms we designed are highly efficient and capable of processing unigene datasets of sizes on the order of several tens of Mb in a few hours on a regular PC.

The deduced {{amino acid sequence}} of one cDNA obtained by this screen was {{shown to be a}} unique protein of 702 amino acids with CaM and cyclic nucleotide binding domains at the carboxyl terminus and high similarity to olfactory and K+ channels. This cDNA was designated HvCBT 1 (Hordeum vulgare CaM binding transporter). Hydropathy plots of HvCBT 1 showed the presence of six putative transmembrane domains, but sequence alignment indicated a pore domain that was unlike the consensus domains in K+ and olfactory channels. Expression of a subclone of amino acids 482 – 702 in Escherichia coli generated a peptide that bound CaM. When a fusion protein of HvCBT 1 and green fluorescent protein was expressed in barley aleurone protoplasts, fluorescence accumulated in the plasma membrane. Expression of HvCBT 1 in the K+ transport deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant CY 162 showed no rescue of the mutant phenotype.

The variation in R. secalis isolates from barley in different agroecological zones of Ethiopia was investigated with respect to colony and conidial morphology, colony growth rate, sporulation and virulence spectrum on a set of ten barley differentials. The R. secalis isolates differed markedly in several cultural characteristics but no correlation was found between these characteristics and isolate virulence. Five R. secalis pathotypes were selected from a total of 19 pathotypes and used to <b>screen</b> 35 <b>barley</b> lines in a glasshouse and also under natural infection in the field.

40|$|Stomata {{are small}} pores {{present on the}} leaves and shoots of the {{majority}} of land plants, which can open and close to allow the plant to balance the uptake of CO 2 for photosynthesis with the loss of water vapour by transpiration (Hetherington and Woodward, 2003). There are two broad classes of stomatal guard cells: the kidney-shaped guard cells found in most plant species, such as mosses, ferns, gymnosperms, dicots, and non- graminaceous monocots; and the dumb-bell shaped guard cells found in grasses and most other monocots. The majority of {{what we know about the}} control of stomatal development and function has been learnt through study of model plants, including Arabidopsis tha/iana, Commelina communis and Vicia faba. The aim of the work presented in this thesis was to,~A advance our knowledge regarding the stomata of the agronomicatle- and commercially valuable cereals, Hordeum vu/gare (barley) and Triticum aestivum (wheat). A <b>screen</b> of <b>barley</b> eceriferum mutants identified three lines, BWll 1, BW 117 and BW 119, with aberrant stomatal development; and a <b>screen</b> of <b>barley</b> wilting leaf blade mutants identified one line, WLB 2, with a significantly reduced stomatal response to the plant drought hormone abscisic acid (ABA), and a second line, WLB 1 S, which could potentially be an ABA biosynthesis mutant. Study of stomatal number in a collection of wheat varieties identified a weak negative trend between water use efficiencv and stomatal density on the adaxial leaf surface. Transcriptomic analysis of the wheat guard cell identified several genes which are likely to be involved in stomatal development or function in wheat, and one candidate, PKABAl (likely orthologue of Arabidopsis OSTl) was further studied in a cross-species complementation experiment. The results of this experiment demonstrated that the wheat and barley PKABAl genes were able to partially complement the stomatal response to reductions in atmospheric humidity when transformed into the Arabidopsis ostl- 4 mutant. It was shown that the barley PKABAl gene (but not the wheat PKABAl gene) was also able to partially restore the stomatal closure response to ABA in the Arabidopsis ostl- 4 mutant. Phenotypic characterisation of two barley eceriferum mutants (BW 117 and BW 119) demonstrated that they had similar and complex abnormalities in stomatal development and vasculature development; and BW 119 showed altered water loss, and potentially altered cuticular wax. Genotypic characterisation of BW 117 and BW 119 suggested that BW 119 is a further backcrossed derivative of BW 117; and this analysis allowed detailed syntenic mapping of the mutation. In conclusion, this project has provided evidence that wheat and barley are adequate subjects for stomatal research, and has identified a number of avenues for further investigation.

40|$|Up to now organic farmers depend greatly on {{conventionally}} bred {{and produced}} varieties of barley. A turning point {{was set in}} 2004 by EU regulation No. 1452 / 2003 restricting the use of conventionally propagated seed and planting material for organic agriculture. Concerning smut fungi in barley, conventional seed producer's attention was rarely directed to plant resistance due {{to the possibility of}} chemical seed treatment (controlling the diseases completely). A main problem for organic seed producers is that organically produced seeds have to fulfil the same regular phytosanitary requirements like conventionally produced seeds. For the production of certified seeds not more than five ears infected with Ustilago hordei (Uh) and/or U. nuda (Un) are allowed on an area of 150 m² in Germany (RUTZ 1998). Though warm or hot water treatment can give excellent control of Un and Uh in organic farming (WINTER et al. 1996), the effect is not sufficient for seed production. Even biological control agents (for example Tillecur®) cannot reach the demands of the guidelines reliably.

The corresponding gene, designated HvGSL 1, is a member of a family of at least six genes in barley. Gene transcripts are detected at relatively high levels in early developing grain, florets, coleoptiles and roots, but not in leaves infected with a fungal pathogen. A (1 → 3) -β-D-glucan synthase has been purified more than 60 -fold from barley suspension-cultured cells by detergent extraction, CaCl 2 treatment, sucrose density gradient centrifugation and non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. The enzyme synthesizes (1 → 3) -β-D-glucan in vitro and is recognized by antibodies raised against a 17 kDa protein generated by heterologous expression of a fragment of the HvGSL 1 cDNA. Furthermore, mass spectrometric analyses show that tryptic peptides produced by in-gel digestion of the active enzyme match peptides predicted from the gene sequence. Thus, the amino acid sequence predicted from the HvGSL 1 gene has been linked with the actual amino acid sequence of an active (1 → 3) -β-D-glucan synthase fraction from barley. Jing Li, Rachel A.

Several abiotic stresses are united {{by the fact that}} at least part of their detrimental effect on plant performance is caused by disruption of plant water status.

40|$|Mycotoxins are {{produced}} by fungi as secondary metabolites. They often multi-contaminate food and feed commodities posing a health risk to humans and animals. A fast and easy to apply multiplex screening of these commodities could be useful to detect multi-contamination. For this, we developed a semi-quantitative 6 -plex immunoassay using a suspension array of paramagnetic colour-coded microspheres combined with imaging planar array detection for the mycotoxins aflatoxin B 1, ochratoxin A, zearalenone, deoxynivalenol, T 2 -toxin, HT- 2 toxin and fumonisin B 1. Mycotoxin specific monoclonal antibodies were coupled to different sets of microspheres and mycotoxins conjugated to the fluorescent protein R-phycoerythrin served as reporter molecules. Competition between free mycotoxins in the sample and mixed reporter molecules for antibody binding sites on mixed microspheres created a multiplex direct inhibition immunoassay. The reagents were selected for no or low cross-interactions between the assays and cross-reactions with metabolites and possible masked forms were determined. A within-laboratory validation was carried out using blank and spiked barley samples. Furthermore, the 6 -plex was used to <b>screen</b> available <b>barley,</b> and malted barley, reference materials. The validation showed very high inter and intra-day precision for all samples with a maximum relative standard deviation value of 10 %. The screening assay allows easy and rapid multiplex detection of the target mycotoxins in barley according to EU legislation. With a cut off factor of 50 %, based on the EU maximum levels, {{we were able to}} screen at 2 µg kg(- 1) for aflatoxin B 1, 2. 5 µg kg(- 1) for ochratoxin A, 625 µg kg(- 1) for deoxynivalenol, 50 µg kg(- 1) for zearalenone, 1000 µg kg(- 1) for fumonisin B 1 and 25 µg kg(- 1) for T- 2 toxin. Thanks to the transportable planar array system, the developed 6 -plex has potential for future on-site testing. Future implementation of this method as a pre-screening tool, prior to instrumental analysis, is highly attractive since costly LC-MS/MS analysis of samples below the maximum levels can be avoided...|$|R

Based on the sequence of these barley clones, which are called nucellains, a homolog from developing corn (Zea mays) grains was also identified. In dicots the vacuolar-processing enzyme {{is believed to be}} involved in the processing of vacuolar storage proteins. RNA-blot and in situ-hybridization analyses detected nucellain transcripts in autolysing nucellus parenchyma cells, in the nucellar projection, and in the nucellar epidermis. No nucellain transcripts were detected in the highly vacuolate endosperm or in the other maternal tissues of developing grains such as the testa or the pericarp. Using an antibody raised against castor bean vacuolar-processing protease, a single polypeptide was recognized in protein extracts from barley grains. Immunogold-labeling experiments with this antibody localized the nucellain epitope not in the vacuoles, but in the cell walls of all nucellar cell types.

Understanding the factors that make plants susceptible or resistant may help to achieve durably effective resistance in crop plants. <b>Screening</b> of 109 <b>barley</b> (Hordeum vulgare L.) accessions in the seedling stage indicated that barley is a complete nonhost to most of the heterologous rust fungi studied, while it showed an intermediate status with respect to Puccinia triticina, P. hordei-murini, P. hordei-secalini, P. graminis f. sp. lolii and P. coronata ff. spp. avenae and holci. Accessions that were susceptible to a heterologous rust in the seedling stage were much more or completely resistant at adult plant stage. Differential interaction between barley accessions and heterologous rust fungi was found, suggesting the existence of rust-species-specific resistance. In particular, many landrace accessions from Ethiopia and Asia, and naked-seeded accessions, tended to be susceptible to several heterologous rusts, suggesting that some resistance genes in barley are effective against more than one heterologous rust fungal species. Some barley accessions had race-specific resistance against P. hordei-murini. We accumulated genes for susceptibility to P. triticina and P. hordei-murini in two genotypes called SusPtrit and SusPmur, respectively. In the seedling stage, these accessions were as susceptible as the host species to the target rusts. They also showed unusual susceptibility to other heterologous rusts.

Two cDNAs, one a 626 -base pair partial-length clone (ACaM- 1) and one a 1400 -base pair full-length clone (ACaM- 2), encode calmodulin polypeptides that differ by four conservative amino acid substitutions. None of the {{amino acid sequence}} differences occur within the four Ca 2 +-binding domains of the proteins. Whereas the deduced amino acid sequences of the two Arabidopsis calmodulin isoforms share 97 % identity, the nucleotide sequences encoding the two isoforms share 87 % sequence identity. Most of these nucleotide sequence differences (80 %) occur in codon wobble positions. ACaM- 1 and ACaM- 2 both hybridize with a distinct set of restriction fragments of Arabidopsis total DNA, indicating that they were derived from transcripts of separate genes; these genes are single- or very low-copy in the Arabidopsis genome. Both cDNAs hybridize to messenger RNA (mRNA) species of 0. 8 kilobases that are expressed {{to a greater extent}} in developing siliques compared with leaves, flowers, and stems. Northern blot and polymerase chain reaction assays both indicate that ACaM- 1 mRNA is more highly expressed than ACaM- 2 mRNA in developing siliques. The steady-state levels of both isoform mRNAs increase as a result of touch stimulation; the kinetics and extent of increase are comparable for the two mRNAs...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of the seven-transmembrane (7 -TM) domain Mlo (mildew resistance locus o) protein {{is a prerequisite for}} successful colonization of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) by the biotrophic powdery mildew fungus, Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh). The mlo-mediated resistance response is dependent on at least two genes, Ror 1 and Ror 2 (required for mlo resistance). Double mutant mlo ror 1 partially restores susceptibility to the fungus and exhibits reduced spontaneous leaf cell death. The Ror 1 gene represents an interesting target for characterization, since its isolation could reveal an unknown pathway or additional molecular components necessary for effective mlo resistance. Nevertheless, despite extensive prior efforts to clone the Ror 1 gene, its nature remains unknown. In this project, we pursued an alternative approach to isolate the Ror 1 gene performing chromosome walking using a barley YAC library combined with Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) techniques. Previously, the Ror 1 gene was located on barley chromosome 1 H to an interval of  0. 15 cM between two predicted flanking genes, Cons and Pol. These two genes were used to design primers to <b>screen</b> a <b>barley</b> YAC library by PCR. The isolated YAC clones and additional overlapping ones, discovered by chromosome walking, formed the basis of our YAC contig at the Ror 1 region. The YAC clones were paired-end sequenced by Illumina. Thorough analysis of the sequences revealed that we obtained two non-overlapping YAC contigs around the Ror 1 locus. Eight annotated genes present in the contigs were selected as candidate genes. However, by “pseudo-mapping” in a Ror 1 recombinant population and positioning in the YAC contigs, seven of the eight genes were excluded to encode Ror 1. Furthermore, comparative genomics of barley with three other model grasses, Oryza sativa, Brachypodium distachyon and Sorghum bicolor revealed re-arrangements in the Ror 1 region. Additionally, for the first time, we could physically locate the Ror 1 region on barley chromosome 1 H using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization. Further chromosome walking steps are required {{to bridge the gap between}} Pol and Cons and complete the Ror 1 YAC contig. The analysis of newly isolated YAC clones/pools that can be used to extend the YAC contigs is currently in progress. Our approach combining classical genetics and second-generation sequencing technologies has opened a new door that can potentially lead to the isolation of the Ror 1 gene. ...|$|R
40|$|The ascomycete Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh) is {{the causal}} {{agent of the}} powdery mildew disease of the monocot barley (Hordeum vulgare). Suppression of host defense {{responses}} and accommodation of the intracellular feeding structure (haustorium) are indispensable for this obligate biotrophic phytopathogen. To manipulate its host plant, Bgh presumably employs small, secreted effector proteins. We bioinformatically identified effector candidates from the barley powdery mildew fungus by screening publicly available EST databases for cDNAs encoding small, secreted proteins of unknown function. A subset of these effector candidates (ECs) enhanced Bgh haustorium formation upon transient expression in barley cells. EC proteins are encoded by single-copy genes, are sequence conserved among different Bgh isolates and exhibit distinct expression patterns during fungal pathogenesis. Plant interacting proteins {{for two of the}} effector candidates were identified by a yeast two-hybrid <b>screen</b> in a <b>barley</b> cDNA library. EC 4 interacts with a barley thiopurine methyltransferase (HvTPMT) whereas EC 6 interacts with a barley ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (HvUBC-E 2). Both interactions were confirmed in planta by bimolecular fluorescence complementation, suggesting that EC 4 might target the host vesicle trafficking pathway while EC 6 might be involved in controlling the synthesis of a yet unknown volatile compatibility compound. We also identified a multigene family encoding putative secreted RNase-like effectors in the Bgh genome. The RNase-like proteins are highly polymorphic and fulfill the proposed criteria for Bgh effectors that are recognized by barley MLA resistance proteins (avirulence canidates (ACs)). We isolated a range of AC cDNAs from two Bgh isolates and tested a subset of them for their avirulence function. The results of these experiments do not support an avirulence function for the AC proteins so far...|$|R
40|$|The origin, {{evolution}} {{and distribution of}} cultivated barley provides powerful insights into the historic origin and early spread of agrarian culture. Here, population-based genetic diversity and phylogenetic analyses were performed to determine the {{evolution and}} origin of barley and how domestication and subsequent introgression have affected the genetic diversity and changes in cultivated barley on a worldwide scale. A set of worldwide cultivated and wild barleys from Asia and Tibet of China were analyzed using the sequences for NAM- 1 gene and gene-associated traits-GPC (grain protein content). Our results showed Tibetan wild barley distinctly diverged from Near Eastern barley, and confirmed that Tibet {{is one of the}} origin and domestication centers for cultivated barley, and in turn supported a polyphyletic origin of domesticated barley. Comparison of haplotype composition among geographic regions revealed gene flow between Eastern and Western barley populations, suggesting that the Silk Road might have {{played a crucial role in}} the spread of genes. The GPC in the 118 cultivated and 93 wild barley accessions ranged from 6. 73 % to 12. 35 % with a mean of 9. 43 %. Overall, wild barley had higher averaged GPC (10. 44 %) than cultivated barley. Two unique haplotypes (Hap 2 and Hap 7) caused by a base mutations (at position 544) in the coding region of the NAM- 1 gene might have a significant impact on the GPC. SNPs and haplotypes of NAM- 1 associated with GPC in barley could provide a useful method for <b>screening</b> GPC in <b>barley</b> germplasm. The Tibetan wild accessions with lower GPC could be useful for malt barley breedin...|$|R
40|$|Plants can use {{ammonium}} (NH 4 +) as {{the sole}} nitrogen source, but at high NH 4 + concentrations in the root medium, particularly in combination with a low availability of K+, plants suffer from NH 4 + toxicity. To understand the role of K+ transporters and non-selective cation channels in K+/NH 4 + interactions better, growth, NH 4 + and K+ accumulation and the specific fluxes of NH 4 +, K+, and H+ were examined in roots of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and Arabidopsis seedlings. Net fluxes of K+ and NH 4 + were negatively correlated, as were their tissue concentrations, suggesting that there is direct competition during uptake. Pharmacological treatments with the K+ transport inhibitors tetraethyl ammonium (TEA+) and gadolinium (Gd 3 +) reduced NH 4 + influx, {{and the addition of}} TEA+ alleviated the NH 4 +-induced depression of root growth in germinating Arabidopsis plants. <b>Screening</b> of a <b>barley</b> root cDNA library in a yeast mutant lacking all NH 4 + and K+ uptake proteins through the deletion of MEP 1 – 3 and TRK 1 and TRK 2 resulted in the cloning of the barley K+ transporter HvHKT 2; 1. Further analysis in yeast suggested that HvHKT 2; 1, AtAKT 1, and AtHAK 5 transported NH 4 +, and that K+ supplied at increasing concentrations competed with this NH 4 + transport. On the other hand, uptake of K+ by AtHAK 5, {{and to a lesser extent}} via HvHKT 2; 1 and AtAKT 1, was inhibited by increasing concentrations of NH 4 +. Together, the results of this study show that plant K+ transporters and channels are able to transport NH 4 +. Unregulated NH 4 + uptake via these transporters may contribute to NH 4 + toxicity at low K+ levels, and may explain the alleviation of NH 4 + toxicity by K+...|$|R
40|$|Drought {{tolerance}} {{is a key}} trait {{for increasing}} and stabilizing barley productivity in dry areas worldwide. Identification of the genes responsible for drought tolerance in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) will facilitate understanding of the molecular mechanisms of drought tolerance, and also facilitate the genetic improvement of barley through marker-assisted selection or gene transformation. To monitor the changes in gene expression {{at the transcriptional level}} in barley leaves during the reproductive stage under drought conditions, the 22 K Affymetrix Barley 1 microarray was used to <b>screen</b> two drought-tolerant <b>barley</b> genotypes, Martin and Hordeum spontaneum 41 - 1 (HS 41 - 1), and one drought-sensitive genotype Moroc 9 - 75. Seventeen genes were expressed exclusively in the two drought-tolerant genotypes under drought stress, and their encoded proteins may play significant roles in enhancing drought tolerance through controlling stomatal closure via carbon metabolism (NADP malic enzyme, NADP-ME, and pyruvate dehydrogenase, PDH), synthesizing the osmoprotectant glycine-betaine (C- 4 sterol methyl oxidase, CSMO), generating protectants against reactive-oxygenspecies scavenging (aldehyde dehydrogenase,ALDH, ascorbate-dependent oxidoreductase, ADOR), and stabilizing membranes and proteins (heat-shock protein 17. 8, HSP 17. 8, and dehydrin 3, DHN 3). Moreover, 17 genes were abundantly expressed in Martin and HS 41 - 1 compared with Moroc 9 - 75 under both drought and control conditions. These genes were possibly constitutively expressed in drought-tolerant genotypes. Among them, seven known annotated genes might enhance drought tolerance through signalling [such as calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) and membrane steroid binding protein (MSBP) ], anti-senescence (G 2 pea dark accumulated protein, GDA 2), and detoxification (glutathione S-transferase, GST) pathways. In addition, 18 genes, including those encoding Dl-pyrroline- 5 -carboxylate synthetase (P 5 CS), protein phosphatase 2 C-like protein (PP 2 C), and several chaperones, were differentially expressed in all genotypes under drought; thus {{they were more likely to}} be general drought-responsive genes in barley. These results could provide new insights into further understanding of drought-tolerance mechanisms in barley...|$|R
40|$|Much of the {{economic}} loss occurring during storage of barley grain is that due to fungal deterioration. In addition, the development of mycotoxins during storage may result in contamination of animal feedstuffs. In this study barley from samples obtained at harvest, from commercial silos after 5 and 9 months' storage, from farm silos after 5 months' storage and from laboratory-stored samples held at 4 °C and at ambient temperature were subjected to various fungal isolation techniques. These techniques were designed to provide information on the total viable counts of the whole grain and of the outside and inside surfaces of the husks and caryopses. Isolates of Aspergillus flavus were screened for toxigenicity and the barley itself was subjected to multimycotoxin analysis. To investigate levels of contamination, dilution plating of supernatants from {{the inner and outer}} parts of grains were examined. Differential viable counts revealed wide variations between samples at harvest and after storage with most contamination on the outer surface. "Clean" grain showed higher outer than inner counts, but for mouldy grains inside counts were greatly increased. It was concluded that inside counts give a better indication of grain condition. Commercially-stored grain showed a marked decrease in viable counts over time, as did the laboratory-stored grain although those held at 4 °C showed a smaller decrease. In contrast, the farm-stored grain continued to yield high viable counts. These counts could be related to storage conditions. Amongst the genera isolated from dilution plates, Alternaria was the most frequent and persistent, whilst others, including Cladosporium and Fusarium, showed falling levels over the period of investigation. The genera Penicillium and Aspergillus showed rising frequencies with storage and were predominant in mouldy samples. Microscopic examination and culturing of caryopsis sections and husk surfaces revealed the significance and distribution of various genera. Alternaria was found in all fractions whereas Penicillium was completely absent from grain at harvest, later appearing on the outer husk and finally on the inner husk after prolonged storage at ambient temperature. Microscopy of stained caryopsis sections showed hyphae only in those from mouldy grain. Microscopy of stained husks revealed hyphae on and in both husk surfaces of all grains, with a greater abundance on the inner surface and in mouldy husks. S. E. M. observations confirmed these findings and established the adherence of spores and hyphae to grain structures and their rough surfaces. Some hyphal fragments associated with the grain can cause mycotoxin contamination. Loosely-attached hyphae were examined using membrane filtration and micro-manipulation techniques. It was found that whilst total levels of hyphal fragments showed little decrease during storage, their viability dropped considerably. For silo- and laboratory-stored grain, the viability dropped from over 20 % to 5 %. In contrast, over 45 % were viable in a mouldy sample. Of the fungal species isolated, species of the Aspergillus flavus group were screened for aflatoxin production using coconut agar fluorescence. Positive isolates ranged from 3 % for farm-stored grain to 25 % of those from grain at harvest. Selected A. flavus isolates were cultured on moist barley which when analysed for aflatoxin gave identical results to those from the coconut agar. A multimycotoxin technique was used to <b>screen</b> 14 <b>barley</b> samples for aflatoxins, citrinin, ochratoxin, T- 2 toxin and zearalenone. Only one obviously-mouldy sample proved positive for aflatoxin, citrinin and ochratoxin. It appears that although A. flavus and other potentially toxigenic fungi can be regularly isolated from barley grains, only in exceptional circumstances are they of significance in relation to mycotoxin contamination of stored grain...|$|R

Salinity was ranged (20. 6 - 21. 9 and 4. 5 - 5. 5 dS m - 1) for both soil and water, respectively. Wheat genotypes Jumaizah, Bin-bashair and Snap and barley genotypes Acsad 176, line 5 and Rum showed high biological yield Performance. Genotypes: Jumaizah, Bin-bashair, Snap, Cham 3 and Cham 6 and barley genotypes: line 3, line 2 and line 5 showed high seed yield performance. However wheat genotypes Behowth 1 exhibited the highest straw yield performance {{compared to other}} wheat genotypes. Germination percentage has a strong positive correlation with seed yield (0. 75) and straw yield (0. 41). Negative association between heading and physiological maturity periods with seed yield (- 0. 29) for each was obtained. Concerning wheat and barley genotypes nitrogen (N) content at the three leaf stage was negatively correlated (- 0. 19) with seed yield compared to the elongation stage, while, Potassium (K) and K/Na ratio showed a strong positive correlation at the tree leaf stage (0. 21 and 0. 22), respectively. In wheat genotypes Potassium (K) content, (K/Na) and Sodium (Na) have showed a strong positive correlation with seed yield in wheat genotypes (0. 26, 0. 29 and 0. 30), respectively whereas, chloride (CL) showed a strong negative correlation (- 0. 26) with the seed yield. In barley genotypes, P and K have a strong negative correlation with the biological yield (- 0. 42 and - 0. 39), respectively and with the straw yield (- 0. 47 and - 0. 49), respectively at the three leaf stage. Sodium (Na) (- 0. 39) has the same trend like P and K but at the elongation stage. It is clear that leaf analysis at the 3 -leaf stage is more indicative to reveal salinity resistance in both wheat and barley genotypes compared to the advanced growth stages. K/Na ratio {{could be used as}} selection criteria for salinity resistance because it is highly correlated with biological, seed and straw yields in both wheat and barley genotypes.
