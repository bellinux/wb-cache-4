5|$|Newly hatched New Guinea {{crocodiles}} feed on aquatic insects, spiders, tadpoles, freshwater snails, frogs, {{fish and}} small mammals. As they grow, {{so does the}} size of their prey and their consumption of fish rises, but they <b>still</b> <b>will</b> eat anything of a worthwhile size that they can find. An adult's diet is largely fish, caught by sweeping the snout sideways and snapping at the prey, but also includes shrimps, crabs, frogs, snakes, birds and medium-sized mammals. A crocodile catches its prey by stealth with a flick of its head, impaling it with its sharp teeth and gripping and crushing it. The jaws cannot move sideways to chew the food; instead, the crocodile's head is tossed to move the prey {{to the back of the}} mouth before the prey is swallowed whole. This crocodile is surprisingly agile and can lunge its body upward into the air to catch bats, flying birds, and leaping fish. It can also probe into the mud at the bottom of a river or swamp with its snout to search for crabs and molluscs.|$|E

The Brahmin Hyderam says that the rajah must marry immediately and his wife must die on the funeral pyre with him. Démaly volunteers to accept this sacrifice and prepares for the funeral. Démaly appears, safe and sound. Laméa <b>still</b> <b>will</b> not marry him, until Hyderam releases her from her religious vows, saying the god Vishnu once married a bayadere. The opera ends with the wedding celebrations.|$|E
25|$|Morgan {{concentrates}} on witchcraft to such degree that {{she goes to}} live in seclusion in the exile of far-away forests. She learns more spells than any other woman, gains an ability to transform herself into any animal, and people begin to call her Morgan the Goddess. Lancelot has a vision of Hell where Morgan <b>still</b> <b>will</b> {{be able to control}} demons even in afterlife as they torture Guinevere. After Mordred spots the images of Lancelot's passionate love for Guinevere that Lancelot painted on her castle's walls while he was imprisoned there, Morgan shows them to Gawain and his brothers, encouraging them to take action in the name of loyalty to their king, but they do not do this. In the Vulgate La Mort le Roi Artu (The Death of King Arthur, also known as just Mort Artu), Morgan vanishes {{for a long time and}} stops troubling Arthur, who assumes her to be dead. One day, he wanders into Morgan's remote castle while on a hunting trip, and they instantly reconcile with each other. Morgan welcomes him warmly and the king is overjoyed of their reunion and allows her to return to Camelot, but she refuses and declares her plan to move to the Isle of Avalon to live there with other sorceresses. However, the sight of Lancelot's frescoes and Morgan's confession finally convinces Arthur about the truth to the rumours of the two's secret love affair (about which he has been already warned by his nephew Sir Agravain). This leads to a great conflict between Arthur and Lancelot, which brings down the fellowship of the Round Table. The goddess Fortune, who appears to Arthur to foretell his death towards the end the Vulgate Cycle, is regarded by some as a double for Morgan. At the end of Mort Artu, Morgan is the first among the black-hooded ladies who take the dying Arthur to his final rest in Avalon.|$|E
500|$|Sean {{leaves to}} jog the [...] {{out of the}} forest to find help while Wes and Lauren wait at the Jeep. He comes across some run down {{buildings}} where he finds a hunting paraphernalia, a bear trap, and dead animals. As he leaves, the bear appears. He tries to sneak past the bear, but instead he runs into the bear and it throws him {{on the roof of the}} shack and then he falls into a chicken coop. Hours later he makes it back to the Jeep, but his leg is injured. Wes decides to climb a tall hill on the other side of the clearing to see if he can get a signal on his cell phone. It does not work and the Bear nearly catches him. He quickly climbs back down and gets back to the Jeep though it <b>still</b> <b>will</b> not start. He and Lauren hide in the Jeep with the wounded Sean in the back.|$|E

500|$|During {{the final}} play Padres catcher Michael Barrett {{attempted}} to block home plate from Holliday's slide while receiving {{the ball on}} a throw from Brian Giles. Holliday arrived at the plate before the ball did and the ball bounced away from Barrett. Some controversy arose after the game as to whether Holliday had actually touched home plate or if Barrett had successfully blocked him. Several sportswriters, such as Jeff Passan of Yahoo! Sports and Mark Kiszla of The Denver Post, said outright that Holliday never touched the plate. Kiszla referred to the moment humorously, saying [...] "When folks retell this story 100 years from now, he <b>still</b> <b>will</b> not have touched home plate." [...] Padres manager Bud Black and first base umpire Ed Montague both agreed with McClelland's safe call. Barrett said he was unsure but [...] "never, ever second-guessed Tim McClelland at home plate." [...] If McClelland had ruled Holliday had not touched the plate during his slide Barrett {{would have had the}} chance to tag out Holliday, preventing the winning run.|$|E
500|$|The {{pilot was}} viewed {{by an average}} of 2.49 million American viewers on its {{original}} broadcast, ranking 108 out of 112 in the weekly charts. Debra Leithauser and Amy Amatangelo of The Washington Post praised the pilot for relying [...] "on strong storytelling and casting", but hoped that viewers would be able to follow the multiple storylines. Barry Garron of The Hollywood Reporter said that the pilot was [...] "so cleverly constructed, the hero so engaging and complicated and the story so filled with great dialogue that I wonder how anyone can sustain this level of accomplishment." [...] He said that the protagonist [...] "has all the sass, strength, resolve and ingenuity of any of literature's classic detectives [...] and Bell is so convincing in the role that it all somehow makes perfect sense." [...] He praised the pilot and Thomas' writing, saying it had [...] "comedy, deathly serious drama, parody and danger, ingredients not typically mixed together", and said that [...] "if future episodes are half as good, this <b>still</b> <b>will</b> be one of TV's bright spots". Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times felt that Veronica Mars was the best new series on UPN, and that the title character was potentially [...] "this season's most interesting character creation". McFadden described the series as [...] "Alias in its attitude, Raymond Chandler in its writing and The O.C. in its class-consciousness".|$|E
2500|$|Suppose some fixed, {{external}} {{potential energy}} [...] generates a conservative force [...] (for example, an electric force) on a particle located {{at a given}} position [...] We assume that the particle would respond by moving with velocity [...] Now assume {{that there are a}} large number of such particles, with local concentration [...] {{as a function of the}} position. After some time, equilibrium will be established: particles will pile up around the areas with lowest potential energy , but <b>still</b> <b>will</b> be spread out to some extent because of diffusion. At equilibrium, there is no net flow of particles: the tendency of particles to get pulled towards lower , called the drift current, perfectly balances the tendency of particles to spread out due to diffusion, called the diffusion current (see drift-diffusion equation).|$|E

2500|$|During the Qing dynasty, a {{man named}} Wang Yuanwai living in Beipinggao village (about [...] east of Chenjiagou), was {{threatened}} with death by a gang of highwaymen with bladed weapons, unless he surrendered his valuables. He sent for assistance from Chen Suole (see the lineage tree above), who was away according to his sons Chen Shenru and Chen Xunru – despite their being only around fifteen and sixteen years old, the boys volunteered their own help instead. They convinced the messenger to tell Wang Yuanwai to give the bandits liquor, discussed a plan and that night, traveled to the Wang residence in Beipinggao, where they jumped over the fence of the rear garden and there found Wang Yuanwai. He {{told them that the}} highwaymen, numbering around twenty, were drunken in his guest hall. While peeping in, Shenru pushed Xunru into the hall and extinguished several candles by throwing a bunch of peas at them. Xunru leapt onto beam and taunted, the panicked bandits who had seemingly started fighting each other, saying, [...] "So you <b>still</b> <b>will</b> not hand over your weapons and surrender? Gods number one and two are here." [...] Some tried to escape the frenzy, but were attacked by Shenru, who was still at the door.|$|E
2500|$|Some of the game's {{criticism}} {{stemmed from}} the limitations of what procedural generation can bring to a game. While the engine can produce {{a vast array of}} different planets, it is built atop a finite number of predetermined assets, such as basic creature shapes or planetary biomes, and one quickly exhausts these core assets even with the variations allowed by procedural generation. An evaluation of the game's code showed that Hello Games had the foresight to enable new predetermined assets to be added into the game through updates, which Gamasutra Alissa McAloon suggested that with more artists to provide more content, Hello Games or third-parties could exponentially expand the perceived uniqueness of each planet. Kate Compton, who worked on the procedural generation elements of Spore, called this issue [...] "procedural oatmeal", in that while you can pour a near infinite number of bowls of oatmeal with various differences, the end result <b>still</b> <b>will</b> look like a bowl of oatmeal. Compton noted that No Man's Sky lacks a quality of perceptual uniqueness, a problem that other game researchers are looking to try to solve to provide a more crafted but still procedurally generated experience to the player, placing less emphasis on the vastness of potential outcomes as No Man's Skys marketing relied on.|$|E
2500|$|Doctor's Advocate {{contains}} various {{staples of}} West Coast hip hop albums including explicit rhymes about gang violence, {{drug use and}} sex. The album looks into The Game's relationship with his former mentor Dr. Dre on several tracks, most notably Doctor's Advocate which also features former Aftermath Entertainment rapper Busta Rhymes. This album {{is known for its}} heavy West Coast hip hop sound, something that didn't feature much in his debut The Documentary. He worked with a number of west coast artists such as Nate Dogg, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit and Tha Dogg Pound giving more west coast oreientated lyrics. Rapreviews said [...] "He is absolutely quintessentially relentlessly and unapologetically thugging it up on this CD, but unless your name is Joe Lieberman or Tipper Gore you're gonna enjoy {{the hell out of the}} dope beats and lyrical bravado and be begging for more." [...] DJBooth praised his lyrical skills by saying [...] "to briefly touch on the lyrics, only Eminem and Lil’ Wayne are currently equals." [...] However, once again many critics panned The Game's namedropping throughout the album, but Steve Juon of Rapreviews says that [...] "some accused him of being a [...] "name dropper" [...] back then and <b>still</b> <b>will</b> today, the references seem more in keeping with his [...] "soldier of the West" [...] philosophy and less like a filler for lack of content." ...|$|E
