5|$|Some areas were, in fact, {{decorated}} with gold: the shields between the Ignudi and the columns between the Prophets and Sibyls. It <b>seems</b> <b>very</b> {{likely that the}} gilding of the shields was part of Michelangelo's original scheme, since they are painted to resemble {{a certain type of}} parade shield, a number of which still exist and are decorated in a similar style with gold.|$|E
5|$|It isn't a {{personal}} pain which has brought me here, {{as is the}} case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It <b>seems</b> <b>very</b> important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I am convinced of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} a cold open in which Wes infiltrates and destroys the Team Snagem hideout before leaving the organization. Wes starts at the Outskirt Stand, a {{dilapidated}} train engine {{in the middle of}} the desert that has been converted into a shop. With Espeon and Umbreon, Wes's first opponent is a Trainer named Willie. Wes then leaves the Stand and heads to the oasis-esque Phenac City in time to see two men dragging a sack. After defeating them in battle, Wes unties the sack to find Rui, a girl with the ability to discern Shadow Pokémon. They meet the mayor, Es Cade, who <b>seems</b> <b>very</b> bothered about the Cipher problem, but seems to do nothing about it. Later, upon leaving Phenac Colosseum, three Snagem grunts find Wes and Rui. The grunts then reveal to Rui that he was a member of Snagem, and an excellent Snagger. Wes then confronts one of the grunts, which results in the latter's defeat. Finding out that he is an expert at snagging Pokémon, Rui asks him to join forces with her in finding and snagging Shadow Pokémon.|$|E

25|$|Use of the {{empirical}} CFE equation (42), and {{the measurement of}} κ, may be of particular use for non-metals. Strictly, Fowler-Nordheim-type equations apply only to emission from the conduction band of bulk crystalline solids. However, empirical equations of form (42) should apply to all materials (though, conceivably, modification might be needed for very sharp emitters). It <b>seems</b> <b>very</b> likely that {{one way in which}} CFE equations for newer materials may differ from Fowler-Nordheim-type equations is that these CFE equations may have a different power of F (or V) in their pre-exponentials. Measurements of κ might provide some experimental indication of this.|$|E
25|$|Also {{significant}} {{in the history of}} theatre was Kirkman's collection of drolls, The Wits, or Sport for Sport. The first part was published by Henry Marsh in 1662, but <b>seems</b> <b>very</b> likely to have been prepared by Kirkman before they fell into dispute and litigation. Marsh {{was a member of the}} Stationers' Company, and seems to have acted as printer and bookseller, with Kirkman acting as publisher and editor. It was described as Part I, but Part II did not appear until after Marsh had died and Kirkman had taken over his business. In 1672 Kirkman re-issued Part I, and issued Part II in 1673.|$|E
25|$|Tsjalling Halbertsma's oeuvre {{was fairly}} limited, and {{consisted}} {{for a large}} part of rhymes written for the occasion of Shrove Tuesday and New Year, weigh-house notes, accompanying texts for prints, and fortune-telling notes, partly in West Frisian, but to a considerable degree, especially in the early years, in Dutch. Furthermore, it is known that, even before his brothers Justus and Eeltsje published their De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar in 1822, Tsjalling Halbertsma also wrote small tales and poems for a society in Grou. It is unclear what sort of society this was, but it <b>seems</b> <b>very</b> likely it was a remnant of a so-called 'people's society' from the French period, such as were established all over Friesland from 1795 on.|$|E

25|$|A {{seemingly}} unrelated {{construction is}} the -function of number theory. This object {{belongs to a}} special class of functions called modular functions, whose graphs form {{a certain kind of}} repeating pattern. Although this function appears in a branch of mathematics which <b>seems</b> <b>very</b> different from the theory of finite groups, the two subjects turn out to be intimately related. In the late 1970s, mathematicians John McKay and John Thompson noticed that certain numbers arising in the analysis of the monster group (namely, the dimensions of its irreducible representations) are related to numbers that appear in a formula for the -function (namely, the coefficients of its Fourier series). This relationship was further developed by John Horton Conway and Simon Norton who called it monstrous moonshine because it seemed so far fetched.|$|E
25|$|Saša is in {{a three-year}} {{relationship}} with bookish medical doctor Branka, but his job prospects are bleak. It's {{been a year}} since he graduated law school with average grades and he still hasn't been able to land a job. Numerous rejections are starting to affect his self-confidence and he's beginning to feel inadequate in front of Branka who graduated medicine with top marks the same year he did, but, unlike him, right away found a job that she's now excelling at. Furthermore, Branka's parents, especially mother, rarely miss an opportunity {{to tell him about}} it. At the unemployment bureau counter, he meets a flirty and mouthy clerk Koka who chats him up. For his part, he <b>seems</b> <b>very</b> receptive to her relaxed, direct, slightly low-brow, and provocative approach as she seems a polar opposite of his straight-laced girlfriend Branka. While out with Branka one day at a bar, Koka bumps into two of them, saying a flirty hello to Saša followed by a testy chat with Branka who is completely rattled by this encounter.|$|E
25|$|Ranton Priory, {{founded in}} the mid-12th century by Robert Fitz-Noel and {{dedicated}} to the Virgin Mary, was the only monastery institutionally dependent on Haughmond for a time. Its foundation charter states that it is sub regula & obedientia Hamanensis Ecclesiae – {{under the rule of}} the church of Haughmond – and the confirmation by Archbishop Baldwin of Forde (1184–90) reaffirmed that it followed the rule of Haughmond. It is possible that there was friction, as a charter from Archbishop Hubert Walter (1193-1205) <b>seems</b> <b>very</b> assertive in insisting that Ranton owes “obedience and subjection” to Haughmond. Relations seem to have been regulated by undated but probably later document, described as amicabilis compositio – a friendly agreement – between the two houses. This stated that the abbot was to visit Ranton at least annually. It gave the canons of Ranton full voting rights in elections for the abbot, although in elections for their own prior, they were to choose a canon from Ranton and another from Haughmond, with the abbot having the final say. They were free to regulate the membership of the priory, so long as all canons pledged obedience to the abbot.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, Esham {{signed to}} Psychopathic Records, {{releasing}} the compilation Acid Rain. It {{was announced that}} Esham would be {{moving away from the}} horror themes of his previous efforts. On November 18, 2003, Esham released his ninth studio album, Repentance. It peaked at #9 on the Top Heatseekers chart, #10 on the Top Independent Albums chart, and #71 on the Top R/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Jason Birchmeier wrote that [...] "Repentance is a small step forward for Esham. He <b>seems</b> <b>very</b> confident here, comfortable with himself as an artist [...] when he pulls everything together [...] he makes some of the best music of his long, fruitful, yet largely unacknowledged career." ...|$|E
500|$|Devin Brown of CBS News {{called it}} her best video from Femme Fatale, {{and added that}} unlike [...] "Piece of Me", I Wanna Go' offers a bevy of pop culture {{references}} meant to ridicule the rumors about the star – and finally no 'dancing. An editor from Rolling Stone said [...] "The weirdness <b>seems</b> <b>very</b> calculated, but that doesn't make the video any less delightful." [...] Another critic from Rolling Stone noted that the press conference [...] "is hysterical because she's {{one of the least}} media-accessible singers in the world. It's easier to get a sit-down with Bob Dylan than it is with Britney." [...] Becky Bain of Idolator called the video [...] "delightful" [...] and [...] "flat out funny", explaining that Spears [...] "focuses her energy on being too darn cute (and deliciously naughty) instead of having to worry about dancing, [...] is in on the joke and loving it all." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of the points deduction, Arsenal were placed second in the league, eight points behind leaders Liverpool and one in front of local rivals Tottenham Hotspur. O'Leary {{expressed}} his disappointment at the docked points: [...] "The champagne will be out at Liverpool tonight because this makes our task very much harder." [...] His teammate Limpar was more optimistic: [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>very</b> harsh. It makes it a little bit harder to catch Liverpool, but it is not impossible." [...] Indeed, Arsenal went on to lose just one game all season and won the First Division title, seven points ahead of runners-up Liverpool. They became England's first representatives in the European Cup since the ban imposed after the Heysel Stadium disaster was lifted. Manchester United finished sixth, but did not end the season empty-handed, winning the 1990–91 European Cup Winners' Cup in the first season English clubs were allowed back into UEFA competitions.|$|E

500|$|Peter and Lois {{are leaving}} a doctor's office when actor Ryan Reynolds asks them for directions. He <b>seems</b> <b>very</b> appreciative of Peter. The next morning Peter notices that Ryan has moved in across the street, taking Cleveland Brown's former residence. Ryan says he's filming {{for a movie}} nearby. Peter attends Ryan's housewarming party that night, at which Ryan tickles him and {{requests}} that he return the favor. [...] Later that week, they go out to dinner, but Peter immediately exits the restaurant when Ryan tries to kiss him. The next day, Peter tells Lois he believes Ryan is gay but Lois rejects the idea. Peter confronts Ryan, who replies that he is only attracted to Peter's spirit {{in the way that}} a man is attracted to a woman. Angered by Peter's accusation, Ryan orders him to leave and that they can never talk again—but hands him a cell phone so they can [...] "always talk".|$|E
500|$|Holmes's {{academic}} {{interests and}} hobbies were divided among law, medicine, and writing. He {{was elected to}} the Hasty Pudding, where he served as Poet and Secretary, and to the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. With two friends, he collaborated on a small book entitled Poetical Illustrations of the Athenaeum Gallery of Painting, which was a collection of satirical poems about the new art gallery in Boston. He was asked to provide an original work for his graduating class's commencement and wrote a [...] "light and sarcastic" [...] poem that met with great acclaim. Following graduation, Holmes intended to go into the legal profession, so he lived at home and studied at the Harvard Law School (named Dane School at the time). By January 1830, however, he was disenchanted with legal studies. [...] "I am sick at heart of this place and almost everything connected to it", he wrote. [...] "I know not what the temple of law may be to those who have entered it, but to me it <b>seems</b> <b>very</b> cold and cheerless about the threshold." ...|$|E
500|$|Anderle later {{stated that}} the line [...] "was taken {{slightly}} out of context" [...] and that Love was {{more concerned with the}} [...] "bottom line" [...] than the [...] "artistic" [...] side of business. [...] Asher did not recall hearing the remark and could not verify whether it was actually spoken. He said that, [...] "it <b>seems</b> <b>very</b> much like Mike. And to tell the truth, I think he had a point," [...] arguing that Pet Sounds [...] "was not much of a success" [...] and that its music [...] "was [...] not what Beach Boys fans were expecting." [...] Parks believes that Love's hostility toward Wilson and Smile was [...] "the deciding factor" [...] in the album's cancellation. In a 1998 deposition related to the memoir , Wilson testified that Love had never spoken the line to him, and when asked if Love's opposition to the lyrics made him shelve the album, he responded: [...] "No. There weren't as many lyrics as there was just—see, Smile wasn't a lyrical thing." ...|$|E
