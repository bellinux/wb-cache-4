50|$|In the Upper Midwestern states {{near the}} Great Lakes, civil townships (known in Michigan as general law townships and in Wisconsin as towns), are often, but not always, {{overlaid}} on survey townships. The {{degree to which}} these townships are functioning governmental entities varies {{from state to state}} and in some cases even within a state. For example, townships {{in the northern part of}} Illinois are active in providing public services — such as road maintenance, after-school care, and senior services — whereas townships in southern Illinois frequently delegate these services to the county. Most townships in Illinois also provide services such as snow removal, senior transportation, and emergency <b>services</b> <b>to</b> <b>households</b> residing in unincorporated parts of the county. The townships in Illinois each have a township board, whose board members were formerly called township trustees, and a single township supervisor.

Women mostly created in the sectors of education, human health and social work activities (60 % of the creations) and other <b>services</b> <b>to</b> <b>households</b> (57 %), while men created their businesses mostly in construction (97 %) and in information and communication (83 %) (Filatriau and Batto 2013).|$|E

The results of the cross-country analysis indicate that {{an increase in the}} stock of telecommunications infrastructure is positively correlated with an improved health status of the population. To integrate more realism into the macrolevel analysis, the paper utilizes household surveys conducted in two emerging market economies: Bangladesh and Laos. The analysis at the household level shows that a basic telephone service offers opportunities in delivering timely information on health <b>services</b> <b>to</b> <b>households</b> with relatively greater demand for this type of information. Telephone access is also associated with an increased demand for telecommunications infrastructure and medical facilities. (c) 2005 Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} two {{features of}} modern economies {{that are often}} overlooked when formally considering the welfare costs of inflation. The first is the short-term financing requirements of firms, {{and the second is}} the joint roles played by banks in providing valued liquidity <b>services</b> <b>to</b> <b>households</b> and in acting as financial intermediaries. Measured welfare losses of moderate inflation are seen to become quite large when firms finance their working capital expenses by issuing short- term debt, with estimates of those losses ranging to over 450 percent higher than is the case when these financing requirements are ignored. Banks are seen to mitigate substantially the welfare costs of inflation by lessening the distortions in household decisions, and by intermediating a larger share of short-term loans to firms as inflation increases. ...|$|E

40|$|This study assesses {{and compares}} the {{benefits}} of electricity <b>service</b> <b>to</b> <b>households</b> and small enterprises from microgrids, solar home systems (SHS), and the national grid in select rural communities in India and Nepal. Electricity access, in general, leads to reduced kerosene use, more time spent by women on income-generation, and the acquisition of home appliances. However, different types of systems have distinct differences in electricity service conditions. These conditions partly explain why households with SHS exhibit the greatest reduction in kerosene use; why grid-connected households own more appliances; and why electricity access benefits small businesses, but seldom drives key business decisions. The developmental impacts of rural electricity access may benefit from supply standards, greater policy support for investments in productive uses, and further research into the cost-effectiveness of electrification from different supply systems...|$|R
