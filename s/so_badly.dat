5|$|By this time, the German bombers were {{touching}} {{down in the}} Pas de Calais. Two were <b>so</b> <b>badly</b> damaged {{that they}} were written off in crash landings, bringing the total losses to eight Do 17s. Almost all bore the scars of battle. One machine had sustained 70 hits, another 200.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth Armstrong {{was praised}} {{by some as}} a heroine for her actions during the battle, {{displaying}} the kind of courage under fire the militia had <b>so</b> <b>badly</b> lacked during the first months of the Black Hawk War. Her actions, in part, helped the fort's outnumbered defenders give Black Hawk the impression the Apple River Fort was more heavily defended than had been anticipated.|$|E
5|$|The Glider Pilot Regiment {{suffered}} the highest proportion of fatal casualties {{during the battle}} (17.3% killed). The regiment was <b>so</b> <b>badly</b> depleted that during Operation Varsity RAF pilots were used to fly many of the gliders. As glider operations were phased out after the war, the regiment shrank and was eventually disbanded in 1957.|$|E
5|$|About 20officers then marched {{him away}} from Pearl Roundabout. Alekry said that while walking him, riot police also broke his nose and damaged his left eye <b>so</b> <b>badly</b> in the process that he {{temporarily}} lost his sight. He was then taken to a police bus, where his pants were pulled down by an officer who threatened Alekry with sexual assault; though the threat was not carried out.|$|E
50|$|A {{museum in}} Maryland {{has some of}} Andrews's clothing, {{including}} the coat he was wearing when he was <b>so</b> very <b>badly</b> wounded. Two other pieces of Andrews's clothing came up for auction in 2012.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not very much," [...] said Miss Altifiorla. [...] "What {{is there}} for her to do? Poor girl! She has played her cards <b>so</b> uncommonly <b>badly,</b> when she took up with Mr. Western after having been dropped by Sir Francis." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did {{you ever}} see such an ass as that Biffin? I don't wonder that she has become sick of him; and then he has behaved <b>so</b> very <b>badly</b> to her. I really do pity her. She has {{told me all about}} it." ...|$|R
5|$|Marmalard {{and other}} Omegas lure Otter to a motel {{and beat him}} up, believing that Otter is {{having an affair with}} Marmalard's girlfriend, Mandy. The Deltas' midterm grades are so poor that an ecstatic Wormer expels them all, having already {{notified}} their local draft boards that they are now eligible for military service. The news shocks Flounder <b>so</b> <b>badly</b> that he vomits on Wormer.|$|E
5|$|Several nearby office blocks {{were hit}} <b>so</b> <b>badly</b> {{that almost every}} window, front and back, was blown in as the {{explosion}} ripped through them. The timing of the explosion before work hours possibly prevented additional casualties. Reports also indicated that cars in nearby streets caught fire. The roof {{of at least one}} house was blown off. Buildings in the vicinity were evacuated by police, {{not only because of the}} smoke and possibility of more explosions, but because of the danger of structural damage making the buildings unstable.|$|E
5|$|The {{record of}} the 1969 and 1970 Montreal Junior Canadiens in the playoffs was so {{outstanding}} it caused a change in Memorial Cup eligibility rules. Previously, all Junior clubs in Canada were eligible for the cup, but the Junior Canadiens beat a club from Prince Edward Island <b>so</b> <b>badly</b> in the playoffs that 'Junior A' was re-organized into 'Major Junior' and 'Junior A'. Since then, only Major Junior clubs are eligible for the Cup.|$|E

I am {{prepared}} to credit any evil of The Dancing Master, because I hate him so. And The Dowd is <b>so</b> disgustingly <b>badly</b> dressed"-- ...|$|R

5|$|A {{crowd of}} several {{thousand}} gathered outside the courthouse while Lockett's trial was underway. A cameraman asked {{a large group of}} those gathered to shake their fists and yell so he could get a picture. The rest of the crowd mistakenly believed they were storming the courthouse and rushed forward. In the ensuing skirmish, one policeman was injured <b>so</b> <b>badly</b> that his arm later had to be amputated. The National Guard opened fire, killing six people and wounding approximately fifty. Some members of the mob looted nearby stores in search of weapons to retaliate, but reinforcements arrived from a nearby army post by mid-afternoon. Martial law was declared, and no further violence was perpetrated. A month later, Lockett was executed at the Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville.|$|E
5|$|Anti-Earp {{writers and}} {{researchers}} use Frank Waters' Earp Brothers of Tombstone, {{as their primary}} source for material that presents Wyatt Earp {{as something of a}} villainous monster, aided and abetted by his brothers who were almost brutes. Waters detested the Earps <b>so</b> <b>badly</b> that he presented a book that was terribly flawed, poorly edited, and brimming with prevarications. In his other work, Waters is poetic. In the Earp Brothers of Tombstone, he {{is little more than a}} tabloid hack, trying to slander someone he dislikes. To date, no reason has been uncovered for the bias Frank Waters exhibited against Wyatt Earp and his brothers.|$|E
5|$|As {{that battle}} on the Somme dragged on, the Canadian Corps {{was brought up}} and the AIF was {{withdrawn}} from the line to re-organise and reform, having suffered almost 23,000 casualties {{over the course of}} the 45 days that they had been involved. The 5th Division had been <b>so</b> <b>badly</b> mauled, having been incapacitated by the losses they had suffered at Fromelles, that it was not until October that the 5th Division finally returned to the line and joined the 1st, 2nd and 4th Divisions on the Somme near Flers.|$|E
5000|$|Although initial issues only sold 50 copies, {{circulation}} soon {{increased to}} 15,000. The innovative appeal of Sniffin' Glue was its immediacy. [...] "Sniffin' Glue was not <b>so</b> much <b>badly</b> written as barely written; grammar was non-existent, layout was haphazard, headlines were usually just written in felt tip, swearwords were {{often used in}} lieu of a reasoned argument[...] [...]all of which gave Sniffin' Glue its urgency and relevance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] began Robin, with a hypocritical sigh of despair, [...] "you {{must know}} that {{everything}} in nature {{is more or less}} a conductor of electricity, but some things conduct it so well--such as copper and iron--that they are called conductors, and some things--such as glass and earthenware--conduct it <b>so</b> very <b>badly</b> that they scarcely conduct it at all, and are called non-conductors. D'ee see?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not quite. My {{foot was}} caught {{under the seat}} and was {{wrenched}} pretty <b>badly,</b> <b>so</b> much so that I had a man take me half a mile in a wheelbarrow to a doctor's." ...|$|R
5|$|Despite {{being located}} in remote Scapa Flow, Battleship Division Nine {{was unable to}} avoid a global killer that struck just as World War I was coming to a close. Spanish Influenza—which killed {{millions}} worldwide in 1918–1919—did not spare the Grand Fleet. By late fall, an average of seven men per day were dying of the virus throughout the Fleet, and some ships were <b>so</b> <b>badly</b> affected that they were practically unmanageable. Though they were not as badly hit {{as some of the}} British vessels, the American battleships were not immune. By early November, only Florida was not in quarantine, and Arkansas had 259 cases, with 11 deaths.|$|E
5|$|Eddie {{returns to}} {{challenge}} Fats again, putting up his entire $3,000 stake {{on a single}} game. He wins game after game, beating Fats <b>so</b> <b>badly</b> that Fats is forced to quit. Bert demands a share of Eddie's winnings and threatens that Eddie will be injured unless he pays. But Eddie says that {{if he is not}} killed he will kill Bert when he recovers; invoking the memory of Sarah, he shames Bert into giving up his claim. Instead, Bert orders Eddie never to walk into a big-time pool hall again. Eddie and Fats compliment each other as players, and Eddie walks out.|$|E
5|$|Hamelin {{had used}} the British preoccupation with Île Bonaparte to send {{additional}} frigates to sea during 1809 and early 1810, including his flagship Vénus, which captured three East Indiamen at the Action of 18 November 1809, and Bellone, which took the Portuguese frigate Minerva in the Bay of Bengal a few days later. Minerva, renamed Minerve in French hands, was subsequently involved in the Action of 3 July 1810, when a further two East Indiamen were captured. The squadron in this action was commanded by Guy-Victor Duperré in Bellone, whose ships were <b>so</b> <b>badly</b> damaged that Duperré was forced to spend nearly a month repairing his vessels in the Comoros Islands before {{they were ready to}} return to Isle de France.|$|E
5000|$|If unduly long, {{and without}} the vim of her journalism, Shute’s book showed that the world {{depicted}} with more economy in Evelyn Waugh's Vile Bodies was no fantasy. Rebecca West declared: “Miss Shute writes, not <b>so</b> much <b>badly</b> as barbarously, {{as if she had}} never read anything but a magazine, never seen a picture but a moving one, never heard any music except at restaurants. Yet she is full of talent.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... “We cannot {{suppose the}} American {{government}} <b>so</b> naïve or <b>badly</b> informed as {{to imagine that}} the presence of American war-vessels at Havana will be a cause of satisfaction to Spain or an indication of friendship.” ...|$|R
60|$|Next day {{the patient}} seemed worse, {{and the heart}} more irregular. He rested <b>badly.</b> <b>So</b> far, Lilly had got a fair night's rest. Now Aaron was not sleeping, {{and he seemed to}} {{struggle}} in the bed.|$|R
5|$|In the Maylands {{industrial}} area the worst affected buildings were the Northgate Information Solutions headquarters and the Fujifilm building. These buildings were <b>so</b> <b>badly</b> damaged they were rendered completely unusable. Demolition of the Fujifilm building began soon afterwards, and by June 2006 {{it had been}} completely removed from the site. Although the Northgate and Fujifilm buildings were closest to the blast, the surrounding Catherine House (to the north), Keystone Distribution building (to the west), 3Com Corporation and RO buildings (to the south), were also extensively damaged. In all, six buildings were designated for demolition and 30 more required major repairs before they could be reoccupied.|$|E
5|$|Lovato {{was raised}} in Dallas, Texas. In 2002, she began her acting career on the children's {{television}} series Barney & Friends as Angela. She began playing piano at age seven and guitar at ten, when she also began dancing and acting classes. Lovato told Ellen DeGeneres that she was bullied <b>so</b> <b>badly</b> that she asked for homeschooling, and she received her high-school diploma through homeschooling in April 2009. She later became {{a spokesperson for the}} anti-bullying organization PACER and appeared on America's Next Top Model to speak out against bullying. In 2006, Lovato appeared on Prison Break, and on Just Jordan the following year.|$|E
5|$|Martin {{checked out}} and {{returned}} to Singapore on 19 March. On that day the skulls of the Damudes were found in a disused tin mine in Kathu district. A torso and a pair each of arms and legs were found along Bahn Nai Trang Road, 9.7kilometres (6mi) away, five days later. The body parts were <b>so</b> <b>badly</b> decomposed that visual identification was impossible; Royal Thai Police used dental records to identify the skulls and forensic analysis concluded that the torso, arms, and legs {{were likely to be}} Sheila's. The other parts of Darin's body were never found.|$|E
5|$|Labour {{comprised}} skilled volunteers, engineers, {{designers and}} supervisors, who were paid and treated well, second came volunteer workers, often skilled technicians, such as carpenters, plumbers, electricians and metal workers, again these workers were paid, took holidays and were well treated. Next came unskilled forced labour, paid very little and treated quite harshly, lastly came effective slave labour, paid <b>so</b> little, <b>badly</b> fed and treated very harshly. The OT ran training courses to improve labour skills.|$|R
