5|$|Cyan playtested {{the game}} with two people {{sitting in front of}} the game, finding that they would {{converse}} with each other and vocalize their likes and dislikes compared to one person silently playing. Rand and Robyn <b>sat</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> testers taking notes, and could make on-the-fly changes and fixes. Cyan wanted the interface of the game to be invisible, and to craft a game that all kinds of people would enjoy. Early on they had decided that there would be no inventory, enemies, or ways to die; eventually they included a save system as a concession to the fact that it would take most players months to complete the game. Among the problems testers discovered with the story was that Myst initially had no inciting incident. In response, Cyan added a note from Atrus to Catherine that clued players into the existence of a chamber by the dock that played a message from Atrus and explained the game's objectives.|$|E
25|$|Two pilots {{occupied}} separate cockpits {{either side}} of the fuselage, while a bombardier sat in the nose. One or two flight engineers <b>sat</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> cockpits to help tend the engines. A radio operator and a navigator were seated next to them.|$|E

25|$|The {{slim and}} compact {{fuselage}} {{of the aircraft}} was quite cramped, wide enough only for a single person. The navigator <b>sat</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> pilot and access in the cockpit required folding down the seats. Once in place, the crew had almost no room to move and were typically uncomfortable during long missions. Aircrews referred to the Hampden by various nicknames due to this, such as Flying Suitcase, Panhandle, and Flying Tadpole.|$|E
25|$|A new {{cinder block}} church, {{situated}} {{northeast of the}} Friary, was built between August 1, 1959 and March 27, 1960. It was dedicated on March 27 in honor of Our Lady of Fátima, {{at which point the}} name was officially changed from the Annunciation Mission to Our Lady of Fatima Catholic Church. On the completion of the church, the St. Joseph Bell was moved and was set into a tower in the church and equipped with a stationary swinging bell-rocker system. Major changes were done to the interior of the Annunciation Mission in 1964, by the friar in charge, Ivo Zirkelbach. Altars were removed, as were the partitions which created the sacristy and sanctuary boundaries. Zirkelbach also tore down the open garage which <b>sat</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Friary.|$|E
25|$|The early A-3 {{variants}} had {{a crew of}} three: pilot, bombardier/navigator (BN) and crewman/navigator (aka: third crewman). An unusual cockpit configuration {{was incorporated}} with the three crew sitting under a framed canopy. In the raised compartment, the pilot and bombardier/navigator sat in a side-by-side arrangement with the pilot's station {{on the port side}} having full flight controls. On initial variants, a third crew member, who also acted as a gunner for the twin tail-mounted 20mm cannons that briefly equipped the original bomber version of the A3D/A-3A (removed and replaced by ECM equipment), <b>sat</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> pilot in an aft-facing seat. The third crewman station had the sextant for celestial navigation and the defensive electronic counter measures equipment. Later electronic reconnaissance variants could accommodate a crew of seven with the flight crew consisting of a pilot, co-pilot and navigator plus four electronic systems operators occupying stations in the former bomb bay in the spacious fuselage.|$|E

60|$|Captain Lee, who <b>sat</b> {{immediately}} <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> toady {{and felt}} his fingers and toes tingling, lost {{a good deal of}} what followed, in consequence of falling into a speculative reverie, as to what might be the legal consequences, if he were to put his own hat on the toady's head, and crush it down over his eyes and mouth.|$|R

500|$|Leonard Pierce of The A.V. Club {{remarked on}} the [...] "burden" [...] that [...] "weighs {{particularly}} heavy on bands that made their reps with intensity and innovation; Slayer, in particular, {{was perceived as}} wandering in the wilderness during the years Paul Bostaph <b>sat</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> drum kit." [...] He rewarded the album with an A–, describing it as [...] "eclectic, but never self-consciously so. It rarely flags in intensity, and it's good enough {{that if it were}} inserted in Slayer’s discography right after Seasons In The Abyss — the record it most resembles — it would be an almost seamless transition." [...] Adrien Begrand of PopMatters gave the album eight out of ten stars, saying, [...] "It's a slight improvement on Christ Illusion, as more than on any of their previous five albums, the foursome of guitarists Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King, bassist/vocalist Tom Araya, and drummer Dave Lombardo find themselves revisiting the seminal styles of their 1986–88 heyday." [...] About.com's Chad Bowar and MusicOMH gave the album four out of five stars.|$|E
500|$|The VIT-1 was a low-winged, twin-engined {{aircraft}} with a mixed structure. The monocoque fuselage {{was made}} in halves of 'shpon', molded birch plywood. The wing and tail structures were built from a mix of steel tubes and duralumin with a duralumin skin. The VIT-1 had the first metal-skinned control surfaces in the USSR. The main legs of the conventional landing gear retracted aft into the engine nacelles, but the tailwheel was fixed. The nose was extensively glazed to give the bombardier/navigator good visibility and he was armed with a [...] ShVAK cannon with 10° of vertical travel. The rear gunner/radio operator <b>sat</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> pilot in a manually operated turret armed with a [...] ShKAS machine gun. Two [...] Shpitalnyi Sh-37 cannon were mounted in the wing roots with very prominent barrels. Up to [...] of bombs could be carried internally in the fuselage or a pair of [...] FAB-500 bombs could be carried under the wings. It used a pair of [...] Klimov M-103 inline engines driving 3-bladed propellers.|$|E
50|$|On {{the morning}} of March 18, 1676, the Wamesit Indians burned down four of Edward Colburne's buildings, then {{attacked}} Samuel Varnum and family as they crossed the river to milk the cows grazing in the Dracut pastures. The Indians fired upon their boat, killing Samuel's two sons, and one died in his daughter's arms as she <b>sat</b> <b>behind</b> him. <b>The</b> accompanying soldiers and Samuel fired back, but the Indians fled.|$|R

Just before releasing their 3rd single, [...] "Isolation From No.13," [...] the band lost its long-time bassist (and Jerry Only lookalike), Anti, {{as well as their}} drummer, H. Nishio. A long-time friend of Hirosuke's and avid Balzac fan, Akio Imai, joined the band as the new bassist. Masami <b>sat</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> drums for the next few releases.|$|E
2500|$|Gaon Ẓemaḥ refers in a responsum to [...] "the ancient {{scholars}} {{of the first}} row, who {{take the place of}} the great sanhedrin". The seven masters, or [...] "allufim" [...] and the [...] "ḥaberim", the three most prominent among {{the other members of the}} college, sat in the first of the seven rows. Nine sanhedrists were subordinated to each of the seven allufim, who probably supervised the instruction given during the entire year by their subordinates. The members of the academy who were not ordained <b>sat</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> seven rows of sanhedrists.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1969 film Battle of Britain, Dowding {{was played}} by Laurence Olivier. Olivier had himself {{served as a}} pilot in the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm during World War II.

Olivier told Dowding he had <b>sat</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> latter's desk all day [...] "pretending to be you" [...] and was [...] "making an awful mess of it too", to which Dowding replied, [...] "Oh, I'm sure you are."

50|$|The Type 60 had a {{welded steel}} hull, with a sloped Glacis plate and {{vertical}} hull sides and rear. It was {{operated by a}} crew of four (driver, bow gunner, commander and gunner). The driver sat at the front-right of the hull, with the bow gunner, armed with a single 7.62 mm M1919 Browning machine gun sitting to his left. <b>The</b> commander <b>sat</b> <b>behind</b> and between <b>the</b> bow gunner and driver, while <b>the</b> gunner <b>sat</b> <b>behind</b> and to <b>the</b> right of the commander, operating a 0.5 in (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine gun mounted of the vehicle's roof. Six troops were carried in a compartment {{at the rear of}} the hull, accessed by two doors at the back of the vehicle. Some Type 60 APCs were fitted with two KAM-3D wire-guided anti-tank missiles on the rear of the hull.|$|R
2500|$|The Bf 109 G-12 was a two-seat trainer {{version of}} the Bf 109. This was a {{conversion}} of [...] "war-weary" [...] or rebuilt G-4 and G-6 airframes; the space needed for the second cockpit was gained by reducing the internal fuel capacity to only 240L (60US gal) meaning that the 300L (80US gal) drop tank was employed as standard equipment. This version was rarely armed with anything {{more than one or}} two cowling machine guns. The rear cockpit canopy was bowed out to give the instructor, who <b>sat</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> student pilot in an armoured seat, a clearer view. The rear cockpit was also equipped with a basic instrument panel and all flight controls.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the opening}} of the {{building}} until 1987, the extra press not involved in the radio or television broadcasts <b>sat</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> south side (team bench side) press table. The working press then moved to sit courtside at [...] "press row" [...] on the northern side of the court, as the south courtside seats were opened up to influential and affluent boosters. In 2003, the UCLA Athletic Department made available north side courtside seats to affluent donors. The media now sit higher up in permanent seating dead-center in {{the north side of the}} bleachers. The press move to the north side in 1987 was as controversial as the 2003 move, in that the student section was now behind the press table and big donors had taken the south side courtside seats.|$|E
2500|$|Hawker's {{design was}} a single-bay biplane {{powered by a}} Rolls-Royce F.XI [...] {{water-cooled}} V12 engine (the engine that later {{became known as the}} Rolls-Royce Kestrel). [...] It had, as the specification required, a metal structure, with a fuselage structure of steel-tube covered by aluminium panels and fabric, with the wings having steel spars and duralumin ribs, covered in fabric. The crew of two sat in individual tandem cockpits, with the pilot sitting under the wing trailing edge, and operating a single [...]303in (7.7mm) Vickers machine gun mounted on the port side of the cockpit. The observer <b>sat</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> pilot, and was armed with a single Lewis gun on a ring mount, while for bomb-aiming, he lay prone under the pilot's seat. Up to 520pounds (240kg) of bombs could be carried under the aircraft's wings.|$|E

Underwater mine fields were a critical component of the defence, and smaller guns were also employed to protect the mine fields from minesweeping vessels.|$|R
2500|$|According to the {{memoirs of}} Mullin leader Patrick Nee, Paul McGonagle was {{thoroughly}} livid over {{the murder of}} his brother and, believing that O'Sullivan was responsible, received permission to kill him. On March 28, 1971, after having dinner with his wife at Jimmy's Harborside Restaurant, O'Sullivan dropped his wife off at their home and told her that he had an errand to do and that he would be back in an hour. Shortly after midnight, Mary noticed that his car was parked in the driveway in front of their house at the bottom of their driveway, it was surrounded by a group of neighbors. She went out to see what her neighbors were looking at and she saw her husband's bullet riddled body. She at first did not recognize his body but made positive identification from the suit that he wore. O'Sullivan had been shot by several gunmen numerous times as he <b>sat</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> wheel of his car and was hanging half out of the car with the driver's door open.|$|E

Gosden, who was winning the race for the first time said [...] "It's great to win the Arc in France and the Derby in England - that's what it's about.
