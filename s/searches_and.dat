5|$|Gens {{also came}} into {{conflict}} with the Judenrat and Friend over the Jewish policemen who guarded the gates into the ghetto. The Germans allowed the Jewish policemen to control access to the ghetto and conduct searches for contraband. Gens' policy was that when no Germans were present at the gates, the policemen would do minimal <b>searches</b> <b>and</b> would allow smuggling of food and other necessary items. If Germans were present at the gates, the policemen conducted thorough <b>searches</b> <b>and</b> often beat up attempted smugglers. In Gens' view, if the Germans thought the Jewish policemen were not vigilant enough, the policemen would be replaced by German guards and any opportunity for smuggling would cease. He also claimed that even when the Germans were present, any confiscated items were brought into the ghetto, which {{would not be the}} case if there were German guards at the gates.|$|E

5|$|The Fourth Amendment (Amendment IV) to the United States Constitution prohibits {{unreasonable}} <b>searches</b> <b>and</b> seizures. It requires governmental <b>searches</b> <b>and</b> seizures to {{be conducted}} only upon issuance of a warrant, judicially sanctioned by probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, particularly describing {{the place to be}} searched and the persons or things to be seized. It is part of the Bill of Rights and was adopted in response to the abuse of the writ of assistance, a type of general search warrant issued by the British government, and a major source of tension in pre-Revolutionary America. The Fourth Amendment was introduced in Congress in 1789 by James Madison, along with the other amendments in the Bill of Rights, in response to Anti-Federalist objections to the new Constitution. Congress submitted the amendment to the states on September 28, 1789. By December 15, 1791, the necessary three-fourths of the states had ratified it. On March 1, 1792, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced the adoption of the amendment.|$|E

5|$|Tera McArthur asked {{two police}} {{officers}} to accompany her to a trailer home where she lived with her husband Charles, {{so that she could}} take her belongings out of the home. Just after she came out of the trailer, she told the police that Charles McArthur had drugs inside. The police knocked and asked Charles if they could search, which he refused. He then came out of the trailer; an officer prevented him from going back inside while the other policeman rushed to get a warrant. The Illinois Appellate Court held that this action violated the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable <b>searches</b> <b>and</b> seizures without a warrant.

5|$|In 1919, the Rowlatt Act gave {{extensive}} {{powers to}} the British government and police, and allowed indefinite {{arrest and detention}} of individuals, warrant-less <b>searches</b> <b>and</b> seizures, restrictions on public gatherings, and intensive censorship of media and publications.

5|$|In September 1991, Bosnian Serbs proclaimed a Serbian Autonomous Oblast with Bijeljina as its capital. In March 1992, the Bosnian {{referendum}} on independence was passed with overwhelming support from Bosniaks and Bosnian Croats, although Bosnian Serbs either boycotted it or were prevented from voting by Bosnian Serb authorities. A poorly organized, local Bosniak Patriotic League paramilitary group {{had been established}} {{in response to the}} Bosnian Serb proclamation. On 31 March, the Patriotic League in Bijeljina was provoked into fighting by local Serbs and the SDG. On 1–2 April, the SDG and the JNA took over Bijeljina with little resistance; murders, rapes, house <b>searches,</b> <b>and</b> pillaging followed. These actions were described as genocidal by the historian Professor Eric D. Weitz of the City College of New York. Professor Michael Sells of the University of Chicago concluded that they were carried out to erase the cultural history of the Bosniak people of Bijeljina.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a policy {{assessment}} of Canada’s <b>search</b> <b>and</b> rescue system {{with the purpose of}} examining to what extent Canada’s <b>search</b> <b>and</b> rescue resources are able to meet growing Arctic <b>search</b> <b>and</b> rescue demands. This assessment consists of three main sections. The first examining <b>search</b> <b>and</b> rescue in general; its structure, operation, rescue needs, as well as the country’s <b>search</b> <b>and</b> rescue capacity and capabilities. The second section specifically explores Arctic <b>search</b> <b>and</b> rescue, including its challenges and evaluated its future activity; with the third and final section investigating the available options for improving <b>search</b> <b>and</b> rescue in Canada. Essentially, Canada’s system was found to adequately meet general <b>search</b> <b>and</b> rescue requirements, however, it was found to be labouring to sustain itself and does not possess the capacity to withstand any substantial changes in need. Consequently, the system is finding it increasingly difficult to provide adequate <b>and</b> timely <b>search</b> <b>and</b> rescue services to the Arctic region; especially due to its remote, harsh and complex environment. Therefore as the Arctic’s rescue needs grow, the current system will increasingly be unable to meet them. As a result, without adjustments to Canada’s <b>search</b> <b>and</b> rescue system, it will lack the capacity to meet growing <b>search</b> <b>and</b> rescue demands in the Arctic...|$|R
5|$|On {{the night}} of November 12, 1964, Armando Schmerber and a {{passenger}} were driving home after drinking at a tavern and bowling alley in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, California when their car skidded {{off the road and}} struck a tree. Schmerber and his companion were injured in the crash and taken to a hospital for treatment. When investigating police officers arrived at the hospital, they asked Schmerber to submit a sample of his blood, but Schmerber refused. Although they did not possess a search warrant, officers instructed attending physicians to take a blood sample from Schmerber. The blood sample indicated that Schmerber was intoxicated, and he was placed under arrest. The blood sample was ultimately admitted into evidence at trial, and Schmerber was convicted for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquors. Schmerber objected to the admissibility of the blood sample, claiming that the police violated his rights to due process, his privilege against self-incrimination, his right to counsel, and his right not to be subjected to unreasonable <b>searches</b> <b>and</b> seizures. The Appellate Department of the California Superior Court rejected Schmerber's arguments, and the California District Court of Appeal declined to review his case.|$|E
5|$|Schmerber {{submitted}} {{an appeal}} to the Supreme Court of the United States, which granted certiorari on January 17, 1966. In his brief, Schmerber argued, inter alia, that the warrantless blood test violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unlawful <b>searches</b> <b>and</b> seizures, as well as his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The Los Angeles City Attorney's office represented the State of California on appeal. In their brief, the City Attorney argued that the blood test did not violate the Fourth Amendment because the seizure was conducted incident to a lawful arrest. The City Attorney also argued that admitting the sample into evidence did not violate Schmerber's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination because blood is not testimonial evidence under the Fifth Amendment. Oral arguments were held on April 25, 1966, and the Court issued its opinion on June 20, 1966.|$|E
5|$|The Fourth Amendment guards against {{unreasonable}} <b>searches</b> <b>and</b> seizures, {{along with}} requiring any warrant to be judicially sanctioned {{and supported by}} probable cause. It was adopted {{as a response to}} the abuse of the writ of assistance, which is a type of general search warrant, in the American Revolution. Search and seizure (including arrest) must be limited in scope according to specific information supplied to the issuing court, usually by a law enforcement officer who has sworn by it. The amendment is the basis for the exclusionary rule, which mandates that evidence obtained illegally cannot be introduced into a criminal trial. The amendment's interpretation has varied over time; its protections expanded under left-leaning courts such as that headed by Earl Warren and contracted under right-leaning courts such as that of William Rehnquist.|$|E
