40|$|Pig {{production}} is a techno-scientific internationalized business that is continuously exposed {{to change and}} risk. Changes in the Agri-Business are inter alia caused by changes in globalization, information technology, biotechnology and changes in consumer trends. The consumer, {{within the framework of}} the pig supply chain, is fundamental to this study. Hence an in depth review of meat market surveys for the period 1970 – 2000 was undertaken. The central theme of the study is: "How to reconcile meat quality, genetics and the consumer with bio-economic pig production in the South African pig supply chain?" A detailed analysis of the South African pig supply chain was subsequently conducted in order to add value further down the supply chain. The inherent structure of the South African pig industry was researched with the emphasis on production statistics, the pig feed industry, genetic improvement and pig information systems, slaughter houses and also <b>slaughtering</b> <b>statistics.</b> The different industry institutions, industry organisations and computer programmes in support of the South African pork supply chain were also investigated. Genetics is the hidden golden thread running through any livestock supply chain. If a substantial portion of consumer satisfaction and quality assurance can be resolved (guaranteed) at the genetic level (thus conception), these guarantees will be conducive to quality assurance further down the supply chain. Carcass and meat quality have become increasingly important in modern day pig production, despite the fact that the emphasis has been too long on input efficiency and too short on output efficiency in South Africa. This called unambiguously for the accurate estimation of genetic parameters of production and carcass traits through appropriate methodology and the right genetic technology. A high degree of accuracy will further optimize the estimation of breeding values, that of breeding objectives and also enhance the credibility of a national breeding scheme. Genetic parameters for five carcass traits were successfully estimated for the first time in the history of South African pig breeding. In future, breeding values for carcass traits, can now be determined more accurately for the Large White, Landrace and Duroc pig breeds. Extension of the present carcass evaluation analysis (Phase E of the National Pig Performance Testing Scheme) to incorporate the essential meat quality traits such as pHu, marbling, tenderness and colour into future breeding goals should eventually satisfy the consumer. In order to finally progress from an immature to a mature pig supply chain, pig producers must align themselves with value partners on both the input (raw materials) and output (end product and value added products) end of the supply chain. To embrace the concept of quality (a consumer demand principle) all levels in the production chain (at the genetic level through the breeding objectives, at the farm level through the entire production system, in transit and at the slaughterhouse and processing levels) should be integrated.

40|$|The USEPA and the USDA have {{completed}} the first statistically designed survey of the occurrence and concentration of CDDs and CDFs in the fat of beef animals raised for human consumption in the United States. Back fat was sampled from 63 carcasses at federally inspected slaughter establishments nationwide. The sample design called for sampling beef animal classes in proportion to national annual <b>slaughter</b> <b>statistics.</b> All samples were analyzed using a modification of EPA method 1613, using isotope dilution, High Resolution GC/MS to determine the rate of occurrence of 2, 3, 7, 8 -substituted CDDs/CDFS. The method detection limits ranged from 0. 05 ng kg- 1 for TCDD to 3 ng kg- 1 for OCDD. The results of this survey showed a mean concentration (reported as I-TEQ, lipid adjusted) in U. S. beef animals of 0. 35 ng kg- 1 and 0. 89 ng kg- 1 when either non-detects are treated as 0 value or assigned a value of 1 / 2 the detection limit, respectively. 1...|$|R
40|$|Weekly grid {{market share}} by volume for {{slaughter}} steers {{is compared to}} <b>slaughter</b> heifers. Summary <b>statistics</b> indicate average grid market share for steers (42 %) is 27 % higher than slaughter heifers (33 %). The literature indicates that pregnancy and increased dark cutter incidence associated with heifers relative to steers creates additional financial risk when heifers are sold on a grid. Econometric analysis suggests grid market share is less sensitive to change in market conditions for heifers relative to steers. The empirical evidence {{is consistent with the}} supposition that marketing heifers is riskier than marketing steers on a grid. Thus sellers need stronger economic incentives to market heifers on a grid relative to steers. grid pricing, fed cattle, animal gender, risk, Livestock Production/Industries, Q 00,...|$|R
40|$|The United States’ {{beef cattle}} industry’s recent past {{has been plagued}} by a lack of a {{national}} animal identification system. The lack of a national animal identification system has made it difficult, if not impossible, to track a diseased animal back to its farm of origin or determine what other cattle have been in contact with the diseased animal. In fact, during the investigation of the December 2003 Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (Mad Cow Disease) outbreak, the lack of a national animal identification system meant that the United States was only able to locate twenty-eight of the eighty cows that entered the United States with the diseased cow. 1 The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) attempted to fix this problem in 2004 with a voluntary national animal identification system (NAIS). 2 When the NAIS proved to be unsuccessful, the USDA proposed a mandatory animal identification system in August 2011 referred to as the Animal Disease Traceability (ADT) program. This article will analyze the new mandatory animal identification system {{in the context of the}} system that failed in the past. The beef cattle industry in the United States is widespread, with a presence in every state, and includes a large number of individual farming operations. As of January 1, 2011, there were 30. 9 million beef cows in the United States being raised on 742, 000 farming operations. The majority of beef cattle operations in the United States would be classified as smaller operations. In fact, nearly one third of beef cattle operations have fewer than ten cows, with over half of all beef cattle operations having fewer than twenty cows, and almost 80 % of beef cattle operations have less than fifty cows. Conversely, large operations account for just over 9 % of all beef cow operations in the United States, yet these large operations produce over 54 % of all beef cows in the United States. The vast majority of cattle operations have less than fifty cows. The small size of these operations and the increased cost in finishing calves for slaughter results in nearly 80 % of calves being sold within sixty days of weaning. Most of these calves are shipped to large commercial feedlots where they are finished for <b>slaughter.</b> These <b>statistics</b> illustrate that in order for a nationwide animal identification system to be effective in the United States, it must be flexible enough for implementation by a wide array of beef cattle operations. The lack of a uniform, nationwide animal tracking program in the United States makes it difficult to estimate the number of cattle that are moved interstate in any given year. States do, however, track inshipments or the number of cattle that are shipped into the state during the year. It is important to note, however, that the inshipment tracking does not include cattle that are shipped into the state for immediate slaughter. In 2009, total in shipments recorded nearly twenty million head of cattle. Moreover, the USDA estimates that approximately ten million head of cattle are moved interstate directly to slaughter each year. Therefore, about 40 % of cattle and calves sold in the United States each year are assumed to move interstate. Until recently, the United States has taken a fairly laissez faire approach to animal identification in beef cattle. This article focuses on the history and evolution of animal identification systems in United States beef cattle. Part II of this article addresses recent events that precipitated the push for a national animal identification system. Next, Part III reviews the animal traceability component of the Brucellosis regulations, Part IV examines the National Animal Identification System, and Part V explains the recently proposed mandatory ADT regulations...|$|R
