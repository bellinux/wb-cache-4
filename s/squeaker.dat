5|$|When Andy {{returns from}} camp, he accepts Jessie, Bullseye, and the Aliens as his new toys, {{thinking}} {{that his mother}} bought them. He then repairs Woody's torn arm while Wheezy's <b>squeaker</b> has also been fixed. Meanwhile, Al's business has suffered due to him failing to sell the Roundup gang. Woody tells Buzz {{that he no longer}} worried about Andy outgrowing him because, when he eventually does, they will still have each other for company.|$|E
5|$|Woody {{prepares to}} go to cowboy camp with Andy, but during a brief play-time, Woody's right arm is accidentally torn. Andy's mom puts Woody on a shelf, and Andy leaves without Woody. The next day, Woody finds that Wheezy, a penguin squeaky toy, has been shelved for months due to a broken <b>squeaker.</b> Andy's mother puts Wheezy in a yard sale, but Woody rescues him, only to be stolen by a greedy toy collector, who takes him to his apartment. Buzz Lightyear {{and the rest of}} Andy's toys {{identify}} the thief from a commercial to be Al McWhiggin, the owner of a toy store called Al's Toy Barn. Buzz, Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, and Rex set out to rescue Woody.|$|E
25|$|However, San Miguel {{struggled}} in the All-Filipino Cup and was eliminated in the quarterfinals by Formula Shell. One of their finest moments was during a match against Mobiline and star center Asi Taulava. San Miguel's 67-66 <b>squeaker</b> on Asaytono's two clutch free-throws handed the Phone Pals its first defeat after winning their first seven games.|$|E
40|$|The {{nematode}} parasites of 30 spot-tailed robbers, Brycinus imberi, five tiger-fish, Hydrocynus vittatus, 77 large-scaled yellowfish, Barbus marequensis, two mudsuckers, Labeo molybdinus, 114 catfish, Clarias gariepinus, 46 silver barbel, Schilbe intermedius, 66 <b>squeakers,</b> Synodontis zambezensis, three eels, Anguilla spp., 83 Mozambique bream, Oreochromis mossambicus, 81 red-breasted bream, Tilapia rendalli swierstrae and 321 arge-mouthed bream, Serranochromis meridianus, {{caught in}} the Sabie, Crocodile and Olifants Rivers in the southern and central regions of the Kruger National Park, were collected, identified and counted. A single Camallanus sp. male was recovered {{from one of the}} mudsuckers; Capillaria spp. from three catfish and one squeaker; philometrid nematodes from two silver barbel, 15 <b>squeakers</b> and a largemouthed bream; Paracamallanus cyathopharynx from one tiger-fish, 80 catfish, 28 silver barbel and one squeaker; Procamallanus laeviconchus from a single catfish; Rhabdochona esseniae from six largescaled yellowfish; Rhabdochona versterae from 14 spot-tailed robbers; Rhabdochona spp. from 20 catfish, 17 silver barbel, eight <b>squeakers,</b> two eels, one large-mouthed bream and two red-breasted bream; Raillietnema synodontisi from 33 squeakers; Spinitectus petterae from 37 catfish; Spinitectus zambezensis from 55 squeakers; Spinitectus spp. from one tiger-fish and four silver barbel, and Spirocamallanus daleneae and Synodontisia thelastomoides from 33 and 35 <b>squeakers,</b> respectively. Second- and third-stage Contracaecum spp. larvae were recovered from 26 spot-tailed robbers, five tiger-fish, one large-scaled yellowfish, 53 catfish and ten silver barbel and unidentified nematode larvae from two spottailed robbers, 57 large-scaled yellowfish, both mudsuckers, 105 catfish, 45 silver barbel, 58 <b>squeakers,</b> all three the eels, 29 Mozambique bream, 33 red-breasted bream and 26 large-mouthed bream. Camallanus sp. in mudsuckers, Capillaria spp. in catfish and <b>squeakers,</b> Rhabdochona spp. in eels, catfish, silver barbel, <b>squeakers,</b> large-mouthed bream and red-breasted bream, Spinitectus spp. in tiger-fish and silver barbel, Paracamallanus cyathopharynx in silver barbel, tiger-fish and <b>squeakers,</b> Raillietnema synodontisi and Synodontisia thelastomoides in <b>squeakers,</b> constitute new parasite records for the respective hosts in South Africa. With few exceptions, the fishes harboured more nematode larvae than adult nematodes but no pattern of seasonal abundance of either of the developmental stages was evident for any of the fish species examined.

25|$|June 15, 2005 - Paul Martin's {{minority}} government survives {{no fewer}} than 16 confidence votes in the House of Commons. A defeat on any {{of them would have}} forced an election. But in the end, there was no repeat of the single-vote <b>squeaker</b> win of May 19. The closest vote passed 153 to 149; Gurmant Grewal is on stress leave over the tape scandal, two other conservative MPs are sick with cancer, and Thibault from the BQ is away due to the passing away of her father. As well, a series of public opinion polls released just days earlier all showed the Liberals in the lead, one of them released just a week ago showing the Liberals have a 14% lead over the Tories. The Tories seem themselves to not be wanting an election now, either.|$|E
25|$|Because 1990 {{was a year}} {{in which}} no single college {{football}} team was dominant, the Fifth Down controversy played a role in determining the Division I-A national champion for the 1990 season. Most pollsters dropped Colorado's ranking to 14th, apparently feeling that its win over Missouri was not legitimate. However, most of the top teams lost in subsequent weeks, while the Buffaloes won their remaining games, including a 27-12 victory in Lincoln over #3 Nebraska to give them the Big Eight title, and a <b>squeaker</b> over #5 Notre Dame. The Orange Bowl victory over Notre Dame was considered very controversial as well, due to a clipping call on Notre Dame on a punt return touchdown late in the game by Raghib Ismail when Colorado held a 10-9 lead, which would be the final score after Notre Dame was assessed the penalty. A blocked extra point by Colorado {{turned out to be the}} winning margin.|$|E

500|$|The grey currawong {{was first}} {{described}} as Corvus versicolor by ornithologist John Latham in 1801, {{who gave it}} the common name of [...] "variable crow". The specific name versicolor means 'of variable colours' in Latin. Other old common names include grey crow-shrike, leaden crow-shrike, mountain magpie, black-winged currawong (in western Victoria), clinking currawong (in Tasmania), and <b>squeaker</b> (in Western Australia). The black-winged currawong was known to the Ramindjeri people of Encounter Bay as wati-eri, the word meaning [...] "to sneak" [...] or [...] "to track". Kiling-kildi was a name derived from the call used {{by the people of}} the lower Murray River.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson lauded it {{for its use}} of new characters, commenting that [...] "of all season two’s Bart-focused episodes, only 'Bart the Daredevil' offers competition with 'Comic' as {{the best of the}} bunch. It’s a tough call, but I’ll take 'Comic' in a <b>squeaker.</b> The show melds the series’ deft satirical tone with exceptional character development. Bart seems to grow especially strongly, and his psychological meltdown in the third act is hilarious." [...] "Three Men and a Comic Book" [...] was named the best episode of the season by IGN.|$|E
500|$|Back at {{the office}} that Monday, Lasseter {{assembled}} the company in a screening room and pitched the revised version of Toy Story 2 from exposition to resolution. Story elements were recycled from the original drafts of the first Toy Story. [...] The original film's original opening sequence featured a Buzz Lightyear cartoon playing on television, which evolved into the Buzz Lightyear video game that would be shown in the opening Toy Story 2. A deleted scene from Toy Story, featuring Woody having a nightmare involving him being thrown into a trash can, was incorporated in a milder form for depicting Woody's fear of losing Andy. [...] The idea of a squeak-toy penguin with a broken <b>squeaker</b> also resurfaced from {{an early version of}} Toy Story.|$|E
60|$|Government by average {{opinion is}} merely a {{circuitous}} method {{of going to the}} devil; those who profess to lead but in fact slavishly follow this average opinion are simply the fastest runners and the loudest <b>squeakers</b> of the herd which is rushing blindly down to its destruction.|$|R
50|$|Aquatic genets {{are thought}} to be solitary and crepuscular. They {{primarily}} feed on freshwater fish, including catfish, barbels, <b>squeakers,</b> carps, and also crustaceans. They possibly detect the movements of the fish with their whiskers, or attract the fish by patting {{the surface of the water}} with their whiskers.|$|R
60|$|Scarcely had the beaters, {{with much}} {{shouting}} and clamor, entered {{the patch of}} bush in which the pigs were lying, than the porcine family, consisting of a splendid boar and sow, and eight nearly full-grown <b>squeakers,</b> darted out on the open, {{and in a moment}} the horsemen were off in pursuit. The ground was deep and heavy, and the pigs at the first burst gained fast upon their pursuers. There was no attempt {{on the part of the}} pigs to keep together, and directly after starting they began to diverge. The old boar and sow both kept across the plain--one bearing toward the left, the other to the right. The <b>squeakers</b> ran in all directions--some at right angles to the line that the old ones were taking. The object of one and all was to gain cover of some kind.|$|R
500|$|The {{first film}} Shaw {{appeared}} in was Caste in 1930. He {{soon began to}} make a name for himself in films such as Brewster's Millions in 1935, Men Are Not Gods in 1936 and Farewell Again in 1937. He was making about £300 a week during this stage of his career, a significant sum higher than the salary of the British Prime Minister of the time. He brought what the Daily Telegraph described as a [...] "smooth villainy" [...] to the role of Frank Sutton in The <b>Squeaker</b> in 1937, while in 1939 he played the hero Cmdr. David Blacklock alongside Conrad Veidt and Valerie Hobson in The Spy in Black, Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's first collaboration. Shaw described himself as a film buff and called Academy Award-winning actor Spencer Tracy his [...] "great god of all screen actors"; he was so impressed by Tracy's technique that he claimed to become depressed while watching his films because Tracy made acting look simple, while Shaw claimed to find it so difficult to master himself.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} year, Lloyd travelled to New York {{where she}} re-appeared at Koster and Bial's Music Hall. Her first song {{was about a}} young woman who lacked confidence in finding a suitor. The chorus, [...] "Not for the very best man that ever got into a pair of trousers", proved hilarious; The Era observed that the line [...] "tickled the audience immensely". Following this, she performed a song about a French maid who appeared innocent and petite at first sight, but {{turned out not to be}} so. The Era described the character as being [...] "not so demure as she looked, for she confided to her auditors that she 'knew a lot about those tricky little things they don't teach a girl at school'." [...] Many other songs followed and were all warmly received. [...] At the conclusion of each performance, she received gifts from the audience including bouquets and floral structures. [...] The Era commented that [...] "Miss Lloyd's clever character work, her versatility and unflagging endeavours to please were rewarded with deserved success". [...] After the tour, Lloyd returned to London, and moved to Hampstead with Hurley. That Christmas, she appeared in pantomime, this time at the Crown Theatre in Peckham in a production of Dick Whittington in which she played the title role. In it, she sang [...] "A Little Bit Off the Top", which MacQueen-Pope describes as being [...] "one of the pantomime songs of the year". The Music Hall and Theatre Review was equally complimentary, saying: [...] "Brilliant Repertory, Charming Dresses, A Unique Personality!" [...] During the Christmas period of 1898–9, Lloyd returned to the Crown where she took her benefit, during which she appeared in Dick Whittington. [...] The entertainment culminated with a song from Vesta Victoria, and a short piece called The <b>Squeaker,</b> starring Joe Elvin.|$|E
2500|$|In 1926, after {{fifteen years}} away from the stage, Dare played the title role of Mrs. Cheyney in The Last of Mrs. Cheyney at Golders Green, London and then on tour. In 1928, she played Kendall Frayne in The Second Man with Noël Coward at the Playhouse. [...] Dare began her own theatre company in 1928 and toured South Africa in The High Road, The Trial of Mary Dugan, The <b>Squeaker</b> and Other Men's Wives. [...] She {{returned}} from her tour {{at the end of}} 1929 and took over the management of the Haymarket Theatre, where she played Mrs. Fraser in The First Mrs. Fraser. [...] The next year, she toured in The First Mrs. Fraser, and as Femme de Chambre in Other Men's Wives and Clemency Warlock in Cynara. [...] During the Christmas seasons of 1931 and 1932, she played Mrs. Darling in Peter Pan at the London Palladium. [...] During 1932, she toured as Leslie in Counsel's Opinion.|$|E
50|$|The Eagles {{entered the}} season {{as one of the}} preseason favorites. After winning a nailbiter against lowly NU Bulldogs on Opening Day, the Eagles went on an 8-game winning streak, {{sweeping}} the first round, and surviving <b>squeakers</b> against Adamson and FEU, and blowing out UST by 36 points, 114-78 on the first round finale through a high scoring second quarter.|$|R
60|$|With {{their hats}} pressed well down upon their heads, and their spears {{advanced}} {{with the head}} some two or three feet from the ground, the hunters started after them--some making after the boar, some after the sow, according to the position which they occupied at the commencement of the chase, {{while some of the}} young hands dashed off in pursuit of the <b>squeakers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The first squeaky toys {{were simple}} rubber balls which {{produced}} a high pitched noise when air was squeezed through a hole, without a special noise maker. Later examples contained a metal noisemaker {{known as a}} [...] "whistle disk." [...] Brightly colored rubber squeaky toys molded in various shapes became common during the 1940s. Later examples were molded from durable vinyl, and plastic <b>squeakers</b> replaced metal whistles.|$|R
2500|$|For {{several months}} in 1934, Sim was {{incapacitated}} by a slipped disc, which was successfully treated by osteopathy. When he recovered, he made a strong impression on West End audiences as Ponsonby, a sycophantic bank director in the comedy Youth at the Helm. Ivor Brown called his performance [...] "a joy … a marvellous mixture of soap and vinegar". On {{the strength of this}} success Sim was cast in his first film, The Riverside Murder (1935), {{in the role of the}} earnest but dim Sergeant McKay. There followed a sequence of films, a mixture of comedies and detective stories, including Wedding Group (1936), in which Sim and his wife both appeared, he as a Scottish minister, she as the maid; Edgar Wallace's The <b>Squeaker</b> (1937) after a stage production of the same piece; Alf's Button Afloat (1938) with the Crazy Gang; and the [...] "Inspector Hornleigh" [...] series (1939–41), as the bumbling assistant of Gordon Harker.|$|E
2500|$|The Republican Party {{sought to}} reverse its November 2008 losses {{in a series}} of special elections, which {{historically}} draw low voter turnout. In the January 13 special election to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Delegate Brian Moran to run for Governor, Democrat Charniele Herring became the first African-American woman from Northern Virginia to be elected to the House of Delegates, defeating Republican candidate Joe Murray by 16 votes. She was seated on Jan. 26, following repeated efforts by the Republican caucus to delay her seating until a recount could be completed. Because Gerry Connolly was elected to Congress from the 11th District, a special election was held on February 3 to fill his seat as Chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors. In that election, about 16% of the registered voters participated, and Democrat Sharon Bulova defeated Republican Pat Herrity by 1,206 votes. Anthony Bedell, chairman of the Fairfax County Republican Party told the Washington Post, [...] "In November, we got our clocks cleaned. Three months later, even in a special this was a <b>squeaker.</b> That's good news for Republicans." [...] Another special election was held to fill Bulova's Braddock District board seat on March 10. Republican John Cook won the seat by 89 votes.|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} aquatic life, the Congo River Basin {{has a very}} high species richness, and among the highest known {{concentrations}} of endemics. Until now, almost 700 fish species have been recorded from the Congo River Basin, and large sections remain virtually unstudied. This {{is by far the}} highest diversity of any African river system (in comparison, the next richest are the Niger, Volta and Nile with about 210, 140 and 130 fish species, respectively). Due to this and the great ecological differences between the regions in the Congo basin, it is often divided into multiple ecoregions (instead of treating it as a single ecoregion). Among these ecoregions, the Lower Congo Rapids alone has more than 300 fish species, including approximately 80 endemics while the southwestern part (Kasai Basin) alone has more than 200 fish species, of which about a quarter are endemic. The dominant fish families – at least in parts of the river – are Cyprinidae (carp/cyprinids, such as Labeo simpsoni), Mormyridae (elephantfishes), Alestidae (African tetras), Mochokidae (<b>squeaker</b> catfishes), and Cichlidae (cichlids). Among the natives in the river is the huge, highly carnivorous giant tigerfish. Three of the more unusual endemics are the whitish (non-pigmented) and blind Lamprologus lethops, which is believed to live as deep as [...] below the surface, Heterochromis multidens, which appears to be more closely related to cichlids of the Americas than other African cichlids, and Caecobarbus geertsii, the only known cavefish in Central Africa. There are also numerous endemic frogs and snails. Several hydroelectric dams are planned on the river, and these may lead to the extinction of many of the endemics.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the typical snowman-like Kongs, Kong also offers a line of dental chews, balls, pull toys (such as the Kong Wubba and the Kong Tugger Knots), Frisbees, a dog binky, floating toys, <b>squeakers,</b> and various interactive toys and accessories. For cats, Kong also has a line of toys including a cat version of their [...] "Wubba", as well as scratching boards, catnip, and other chew toys.|$|R
50|$|Domestic pigeons {{reproduce}} in {{a similar}} way to the wild rock pigeon. Generally humans will select breeding partners. Crop milk produced by parent birds may occasionally be replaced with artificial substitutes. Pigeons are extremely protective of their eggs, and in some cases will go to severe lengths to protect their productive eggs and have been known to seek revenge on those who interfere with their productive process. Baby pigeons are called <b>squeakers</b> or squabs.|$|R

60|$|So, too, Mr Bright--a hearty good-natured fellow, {{who drew}} powerfully to Major Beak and hated Miss Bluestocking--possessed the {{vigorous}} frame, animated air, and intelligent look {{which must have}} originated his name. But why go on? Every reader must be well acquainted with the characters of Mr Fiery and Mr Stiff, and Mrs Dashington, and her niece Miss <b>Squeaker,</b> and Colonel Blare who played the cornet, and Lieutenant Limp who sang tenor, and Dr Bassoon who roared bass, and Mrs Silky, who was {{all things to all}} men, besides being everything by turns and nothing long; and Lady Tower and Miss Gentle, and Mr Blurt and Miss Dumbbelle.|$|E
60|$|The {{voyage of}} the Trident--with the {{exception}} of the gale before referred to--was prosperous until her arrival in the waters of the northern hemisphere. By that time the passengers had crystallised into groups, the nobodies and self-forgetting-bodies fraternised, and became more and more friendly as time went on. The uproarious-bodies got up concerts and charades. The hatred of Pods for Tods intensified. The arrogance of Major Beak, and the good-natured modesty of Mr Bright, increased. The noise of Dr Bassoon made the manner of Mr Silky quite agreeable by contrast, while the pride of Lady Tower and Mr Stiff formed a fine, deep-shade to the neutral tint of Miss Gentle, and the high-light of Miss <b>Squeaker.</b>|$|E
5000|$|After {{lopsided}} {{victories over}} Vanderbilt, Chattanooga, and Tulane, the Tide started winning {{a series of}} <b>squeakers.</b> Against Tennessee the Tide trailed 6-3 {{in the fourth quarter}} when starting QB Danny Woodson left the game with a strained hamstring. Behind backup Jay Barker, Alabama rallied for three touchdowns in the fourth quarter and won 24-19. [...] It was the Crimson Tide's sixth victory in a row in the Third Saturday in October rivalry. Barker assumed the starting job when Woodson was suspended for violating team rules before the LSU game.|$|R
5000|$|Nutan {{was noted}} for her {{willingness}} to play unconventional roles and several of her roles were labelled [...] "path-breaking". M.L. Dhawan from The Tribune wrote, [...] "When <b>squeakers</b> and screamers ruled the roost, Nutan fine-tuned her dialogue delivery with an evocative voice. A natural throw was the hallmark of Nutan’s dialogue delivery. She was low key and mellow as she was peppery and sarcastic and yet made a strong impact." [...] According to Dhawan, [...] "a fleeting {{expression on her face}} conveyed much more than dialogue," [...] and he further noted her for accepting only roles in which [...] "she either played the main part or at least shared equal footing with the male counterpart." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Humph! It's not so {{agreeable}} as I used {{to think}} it would be, when one has to run after creatures that run faster than one's-self, and one is obliged to use wooden spears, and slings, instead of guns. By the way, what a surprising, I may say awful, effect a well-slung stone has {{on the side of}} a little pig! I came upon a herd yesterday in the cane-brake, and, before they could get away, I slung a big stone at them, which caught the smallest of the <b>squeakers</b> fair in the side. The sudden squeal that followed the slap was so intense, that I thought the life had gone out of the creature in one agonising gush; but it hadn't, so I slung another stone, which took it in the head and dropt it." ...|$|R
