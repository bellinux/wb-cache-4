5|$|The episode {{begins with}} Tom (Shearsmith), a primary school teacher, apathetically marking work while chatting {{to his girlfriend}} Gerri (Arterton), {{who is going to}} {{audition}} for a part in a play. Tom complains about a tramp begging outside their house. Later in the evening, Tom is home alone and Migg (Pemberton), the tramp, comes to his door, to return Tom's wallet. Tom rewards him with £40.

6000|$|Presently he came {{towards the}} forge, and said, [...] "Brand, the stout gentleman there wishes {{to speak to}} you. He <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> you in Arbroath. You can spare {{him for a few}} minutes, I suppose, Mr Dove?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Peter's friend reluctantly withdrew, but threw a cautioning glance towards him. [...] "Ugh!" [...] said Gray Eagle. [...] "Ugh!" [...] {{said the}} other chiefs. A few {{guttural}} words followed to the interpreter, who turned, and facing Peter with the monotonous impassiveness which he had caught from the chiefs, said: [...] "He <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> your father. He was a great chief,--with many horses and many squaws. He is dead." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It was dreadful, Ned," [...] Charlie said, [...] "having to go {{into court}} as a witness against you. I had thought of running away, but {{did not know where}} to go to, and then Mr. Porson had a talk with me and {{told me that it was}} of the {{greatest}} importance that I should tell everything exactly word for word, just as it happened. He said every one knew there had been a quarrel, and that if I did not tell everything it would seem as if I was keeping something back in order to screen you, and that would do you a great deal of harm, and that, as really you were not to blame in the quarrel, my evidence would be in your favor rather than against you. He <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> that you would wish me to tell exactly what took place." ...|$|E
6000|$|October 4.--Slept till nigh ten--fatigued by our toils of yesterday, and the unwonted late hours. Still {{too early}} for this Castle of Indolence, for I found few of last night's party yet appearing. I had an {{opportunity}} of some talk with the Duke. He does not consider Foy's book[50] as written by himself, but as a thing got up perhaps from notes. <b>Says</b> <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> Foy very well in Spain. Mentioned that he was, like other French officers, very desirous of seeing the English papers, through which alone they could collect any idea {{of what was going}} on without their own cantonments, for Napoleon permitted no communication of that kind with France. The Duke, growing tired of this, at length told Baron Tripp, whose services he chiefly used in communication with the outposts, that he was not to give them the newspapers. [...] "What reason shall I allege for withholding them?" [...] said Baron Tripp. [...] "None," [...] replied the Duke. [...] "Let them allege some reason why they want them." [...] Foy was not at a loss to assign a reason. He said he had considerable sums of money in the English funds and wanted to see how Stocks fell and rose. The excuse did not, however, go down[51]. I remember Baron Tripp, a Dutch nobleman, and a dandy of the first water, and yet with an energy in his dandyism which made it respectable. He drove a gig as far as Dunrobin Castle, and back again, without a whip. He looked after his own horse, for he had no servant, and after all his little establishment of clothes and necessaries, with all the accuracy of a petit-maître. He was one of the best-dressed men, and his horse was in equally fine condition as if he had had a dozen of grooms. I met him at Lord Somerville's, and liked him much. But there was something exaggerated, as appeared from the conclusion of his life. Baron Tripp shot himself in Italy for no assignable cause.|$|E
