25|$|The dealer throws three dice in {{the square}} wall and <b>sums</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> total. Counting {{anti-clockwise}} so that the dealer is 1 (or 5, 9, 13, 17), so that south (player to the right) is 2 (or 6, 10, 14, 18), etc., a player's quarter of the wall is chosen. Some house rules may use only two dice but have double throws to increase randomness. In the case of double throws, the player of the chosen wall makes the second throw.|$|E

25|$|Lawton's {{official}} report dated September 9, 1886 <b>sums</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{actions of}} his unit and gives credit {{to a number}} of his troopers for their efforts. Geronimo gave Gatewood credit for his decision to surrender as Gatewood was well known to Geronimo, spoke some Apache, and was familiar with and honored their traditions and values. He acknowledged Lawton's tenacity for wearing the Apaches down with constant pursuit. Geronimo and his followers had little or no time to rest or stay in one place. Completely worn out, the little band of Apaches returned to the U.S. with Lawton and officially surrendered to General Miles on September 4, 1886 at Skeleton Canyon, Arizona.|$|E
25|$|Green, swing {{promoting}} {{and humid}} conditions <b>sums</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> construction of English pitches but everything depends on weather e.g. in summer it may behave like Indian pitches too. Early in the season, most batsmen {{have to be}} on their guard as English pitches prove to be most fickle, like the country's weather. Later in the summer, the pitches tend to get harder and lose their green. This makes the task easier for batsmen and only genuine fast bowlers like those bowling in range of (135–150km/h) and spinners can contain. Spinners prove less effective {{in the first half of}} the season and tend to play their part only in the second half. The humid conditions and little dust makes the grounds ideal place to practice reverse swing with a 50-over old ball. Of all grounds, The Oval is the most dangerous as the ball reverse swings most there. Another reason for this is traditionally it hosts the last international test match of a touring side in a summer.|$|E

500|$|The Poisoned Kiss (1927–29, premiered in 1936) {{is a light}} comedy. Vaughan Williams {{knew the}} Savoy operas well, and his music for this piece was and is widely {{regarded}} as in the Sullivan vein. The words, by an inexperienced librettist, were judged to fall far short of Gilbert's standards. Saylor <b>sums</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> critical consensus that the work is something between [...] "a frothy romantic comedy [...] a satirical fairy-tale", and not quite successful in either category.|$|E
500|$|Gomułka, however, {{could not}} {{and did not}} want to reject {{communism}} or Soviet domination; he could only steer Poland towards increased independence and [...] "Polish national communism". Because of these restricted ambitions, which were recognized by the Soviets, the limited Polish revolution succeeded where the radical Hungarian one did not. Norman Davies <b>sums</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> effect as a transformation of Poland from puppet state to client state; Raymond Pearson similarly states that Poland changed from a Soviet colony to a dominion.|$|E
