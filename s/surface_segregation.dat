40|$|The present thesis {{concerns}} {{applications of}} first principles electronic structure calculations {{in conjunction with}} methods of statistical mechanics for simulations of transition metal alloys both in the bulk and at surfaces. A fully relativistic generalization of the exact muffin-tin orbitals (EMTO) method has been developed. The method accurately takes into account spin-orbit coupling and allows one to calculate orbital polarization and magneto-crystalline anisotropy in magnetic systems as well as increasing the range of applicability of the EMTO method to heavy elements. A new direct-exchange Monte Carlo (DEMC) method has been proposed, which is capable to tackling effectively statistical simulations of <b>surface</b> <b>segregations</b> in disordered and ordered alloys. The applications of relativistic methods include calculations of spin and orbital magnetization in iron-cobalt disordered and partially ordered alloys, as well as computation of the core-level shifts (CLS) in transition metal alloys. It has been found, that relativistic corrections are important for CLS calculations in 5 -d metal alloys. Properties of a Ni monolayer deposited on a Cu surface have been studied. The monolayer {{is found to be}} unstable in the top layer, and its magnetization depends greatly on the surface orientation. Two distinct energy levels have been found to exist Co/Cu/Ni trilayers deposited on the (100) Cu surface, which correspond to a completely paramagnetic trilayer and the case when only Ni is paramagnetic. Vacancy ordering in substoichometric titanium carbides TiCx have been simulated. Existence of three ordered phases in the range of carbon concentration x= 0. 5 ÷ 1. 0 has been revealed and a theoretical phase diagram has been proposed. <b>Surface</b> <b>segregations</b> have been calculated in disordered Ni 50 Pt 50 and Ni 50 Pd 50 as well as in ordered NiPt alloys.

50|$|Like other DMSs, (Ga,Mn)As {{is formed}} by doping a {{standard}} semiconductor with magnetic elements. This is done using the growth technique {{molecular beam epitaxy}} (MBE), whereby crystal structures can be grown with atom layer precision. In (Ga,Mn)As the manganese substitute into gallium sites in the GaAs crystal and provide a magnetic moment. Because manganese has a low solubility in GaAs, incorporating a sufficiently high concentration for ferromagnetism to be achieved proves challenging. In standard MBE growth, {{to ensure that a}} good structural quality is obtained, the temperature the substrate is heated to, known as the growth temperature, is normally high, typically ~600 °C. However, if a large flux of manganese is used in these conditions, instead of being incorporated, segregation occurs where the manganese accumulate on the surface and form complexes with elemental arsenic atoms.This problem was overcome using the technique of low-temperature MBE. It was found, first in (In,Mn)Asand then later used for (Ga,Mn)As,that by utilising non-equilibrium crystal growth techniques larger dopant concentrations could be successfully incorporated.
