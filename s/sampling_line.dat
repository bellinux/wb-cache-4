50|$|Two {{types of}} {{chemically}} absorbent tubes {{are used to}} sample {{for a wide range}} of chemical substances. Traditionally a chemical absorbent 'tube' (a glass or stainless steel tube of between 2 and 10 mm internal diameter) filled with very fine absorbent silica (hydrophilic) or carbon, such as coconut charcoal (lypophylic), is used in a <b>sampling</b> <b>line</b> where air is drawn through the absorbent material for between four hours (minimum workplace sample) to 24 hours (environmental sample) period. The hydrophilic material readily absorbs water-soluble chemical and the lypophylic material absorbs non water-soluble materials. The absorbent material is then chemically or physically extracted and measurements performed using various gas chromatograph or mass spectrometry methods. These absorbent tube methods have the advantage of being usable {{for a wide range of}} potential contaminates. However, they are relatively expensive methods, are time consuming and require significant expertise in sampling and chemical analysis. A frequent complaint of workers is in having to wear the sampling pump (up to 1 kg) for several days of work to provide adequate data for the required statistical certainty determination of the exposure.|$|E

The deep standardized inspiration consisted of a brief (<[*] 5  s) and continuous inspiration to generate a minimum buccal pressure from −[*] 5 to −[*] 10  mmH 2 O without any breathing resistor. Buccal cavity pressures were recorded during spontaneous and standardized breathing. Buccal pressure was recorded using a commercially available MP 101 micromanometer (0 [*]±[*] 1000 mmH 2 O) (KIMO instrument, Montpon, France), connected via a plastic <b>sampling</b> <b>line</b> (usually used as the CO 2 <b>sampling</b> <b>line)</b> to an antibacterial filter in series with a S 183 mouth end piece (Teleflex Medical, Int’Air medical, Bourg-en-Bresse, France). Of note, only the filter could be responsible for a minimal ventilatory resistance of this system. In addition, diaphragmatic excursion (DiaphExc) was assessed during spontaneous and standardized breathing on ultrasound images using the bi-dimensional mode in subcostal long-axis view as previously described [15]. Briefly, the most cephalic point of the liver, corresponding to end-expiratory diaphragmatic position, was identified, and diaphragmatic excursion was calculated as the maximal caudal distance traveled by this point during inspiration as follows: (horizontal end-expiratory distance between the most cephalic point of the liver and the left screen edge)–(horizontal end-inspiratory distance between the most cephalic point of the liver and the left screen edge).|$|E

Although simultaneous {{measurements of}} pulmonary oxygen uptake (VO 2) and Phosphorus- 31 {{magnetic resonance spectroscopy}} ((31) P MRS) is attractive to investigate muscular metabolism during exercise, the superconducting magnet requires the design of specific gas exchange analyser (GEA).

40|$|Methyl esters of soybean oil, {{known as}} biodiesel, are {{receiving}} increasing attention {{as an alternative}} fuel for diesel engines. Biodiesel is a nontoxic, biodegradable, and renewable fuel {{with the potential to}} reduce engine exhaust emissions. However, previous results have shown that biodiesel produces a higher fraction of soluble organic material (SOF) in the exhaust particulate matter than petroleum-based diesel fuel although its total particulate emissions were lowered. Also, because biodiesel has a high boiling point and low volatility compared with diesel fuel, its unburned hydrocarbon vapor could be lost by deposition in the hydrocarbon <b>sampling</b> <b>line.</b> This loss could be the source of reported reductions in hydrocarbon emissions from biodiesel-fueled engines. No information about whether the typical measurement temperature for unburned hydrocarbons is suitable for biodiesel hydrocarbon measurement is available. In this project, the formation of SOF in diesel exhaust particulates and the deposition of hydrocarbons in heated sampling lines were studied experimentally and theoretically;The experimental results showed that biodiesel produced a higher SOF fraction in its total particulates than diesel fuel under virtually all engine operating conditions. The SOF fraction decreased with increasing filter temperature at constant dilution ratio and with increasing dilution ratio at constant filter temperature. Biodiesel injection tests, where a small quantity of neat biodiesel was injected into the exhaust gas showed that most of the unburned biodiesel showed up in the soluble organic fraction of the collected particulates. The response of the heated flame ionization detector did not match the concentration change of unburned biodiesel in the exhaust gas. Based on the predicted results from condensation and multicomponent adsorption models, adsorption of vapor phase hydrocarbons on the carbon particle surface is the primary source of the SOF in the total particulate matter. The condensation process, by itself, cannot explain the formation of SOF during the dilution process. Adsorption of hydrocarbons is also shown to take place during transport of the hydrocarbon sample, even at high temperature. At the standard hydrocarbon measurement temperature, adsorption onto the <b>sampling</b> <b>line</b> walls could affect the concentration of unburned hydrocarbons and biodiesel in the exhaust gas sample. However, when the hydrocarbon <b>sampling</b> <b>line</b> temperature was heated to 250 °C, adsorption did not show significant effect on reducing the hydrocarbon concentration in the exhaust sample...|$|E

40|$|As the {{semiconductor}} industry is moving towards achieving smaller, denser and faster integrated circuits; the issue of contamination control is becoming increasingly important. The current work focuses on the mechanism and kinetics of removal of adsorbed moisture and organics from surfaces and nanostructures. In the first application of this study, a novel approach to the characterization of dynamic interactions of gases with solid surfaces is developed. A model is developed to represent the simultaneous adsorption and desorption processes in these systems. The model can simulate both the non-equilibrium adsorption and desorption processes {{as well as the}} equilibrium state (isotherms and isobars). The model is validated using experimental data, and applied to the adsorption of moisture on oxides (ZrO 2 and HfO 2). Practical application of this work is shown by optimizing the purge recipes for removal of moisture from a ZrO 2 film. In the second application, a novel approach is developed and demonstrated to characterize the <b>sampling</b> <b>line</b> effects during dynamic monitoring of fluid concentrations. The "Sampling line" in this study refers to all components between the point of fluid sampling and the point of analyzer sensor. In general, sampling lines introduce errors in measurements by altering the sample properties due to the fluid transport in the line as well as the adsorption and desorption of fluid constituents on the surfaces of the sampling components that come in contact with the sample fluid. A methodology based on a <b>sampling</b> <b>line</b> simulator is developed for taking these effects into account and correcting the measurements. The <b>sampling</b> <b>line</b> simulator can be used to analyze the effect of various sampling configurations and operating conditions. In the last application, experiments were carried out to study the interaction of organics with micro/nano particles representing nanostructures. A process model is developed which gives insight about the mechanism and kinetics of these interactions. The micro/nano particles, due to their large surface area, can adsorb any other species which may result in the change in their properties. This may ultimately affect the process in which they exist. This study will also be helpful in analyzing the Environment, Safety and Health (ESH) effects of nanostructures...|$|E

To overcome this limitation, the Italian Institute of Health has developed and implemented a multi purpose air sampling system based on a fixed wing aircraft, for time-effective, large areas radiological surveillance (to face radiological emergency and to support homeland security). A fixed wing aircraft (Sky Arrow 650) with the front part of the fuselage properly adapted to house the detection equipment has been equipped with a compact air <b>sampling</b> <b>line</b> where the isokinetic sampling is dynamically maintained.

40|$|The HALO Submicrometer Aerosol Inlet (HASI) was {{specifically}} designed for HALO with the aim to provide up to 30 l/min sample air flow (divided over four forward facing <b>sample</b> <b>lines)</b> to aerosol instruments mounted inside the aircraft cabin. HASI samples the air {{on the top of}} the fuselage outside of the aircraft boundary layer. The air stream is aligned in the inlet and deaccelerated in three stages by roughly a factor of 40 using a front shroud, a main diffusor and smaller diffusers at the tips of four sample tubes which protrude into the deaccelerated air stream. In addition, there is a backward-facing sample tube installed for optional use. The design concept is to allow regulating the sample air flow in each of the four forward-facing <b>sample</b> <b>lines</b> to achieve isokinetic sampling conditions according to the actual speed of the aircraft. Pumps and bypass lines for regulation of the air flow are part of the Aerosol Measurement System (AMETYST) cabin rack on HALO operated by DLR. The geometric design of the inlet should prevent large cloud droplets and ice crystals from entering the <b>sample</b> <b>lines</b> directly. Judging from the first measurements of different instruments using HASI during the ML-CIRRUS and ACRIDICON-CHUVA missions with HALO, it appears that condensation particle counter (CPC) measurements of interstitial aerosol in liquid clouds are affected by artefacts while in ice clouds there is no indication of any measurement problem. Selected examples of other measurement results for initial experimental characterization of the inlet will be discussed. In order to achieve better isokinetic sampling, further numerical flow simulations of the final inlet design for different aircraft altitudes and speeds are required to establish a final regulation of the sample air flow in each of the four <b>sample</b> <b>lines</b> based on pressure and temperature sensors in the inlet and aircraft data...|$|R

Our reconstruction relies on generalized Hermite-Birkhoff interpolation by positive definite kernel functions in combination with a suitable regularization of the Radon transform.

This study critically examines the real predictive capability of a three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model, Fluidyn-PANACHE, to apply it in emergency contexts of an accidental or deliberate airborne release in urban regions. The model is evaluated with the Mock Urban Setting Test (MUST) field experiment of a continuous point source release in an idealized urban geometry of a regular array of shipping containers in various atmospheric stability varying from neutral to stable, and very stable conditions. The simulations are performed using three combinations (cases 1, 2, & 3) of inflow boundary conditions for wind and turbulence profiles. A detailed analysis with statistical measures shows that {{the performance of the}} Fluidyn-PANACHE against MUST experiment with all the three cases of the inflow boundary conditions is well achieved within the acceptable standards for air quality applications.
