40|$|This study {{presents}} {{air distribution}} {{systems that are}} based on confluent jets; this system can be of interest for the establishment of indoor environments, to fulfill the goals of indoor climate and energy-efficient usage. The main objective {{of this study is to}} provide deeper understanding of the flow field development of a <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> that is designed based on wall confluent jets and to investigate the ventilation performance by experimental and numerical methods. In this study, the <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> can be described as an array of round jets on a flat surface attached to a side wall. Multiple round jets that issue from <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> apertures are combined at a certain distance downstream from the device and behave as a united jet or so-called confluent jets. Multiple round jets that are generated from the <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> move downward and are attached to the wall at the primary region, due to the Coanda effect, and then they become wall confluent jets until the floor wall is reached. A wall jet in a secondary region is formed along the floor after the stagnation region. The characteristics of the flow field and the ventilation performance of conventional wall confluent jets and modified wall confluent jets supply devices are investigated experimentally in an office test room. The study of the modified wall confluent jets is intended to improve the efficiency of the conventional one while maintaining acceptable thermal comfort in an office environment. The results show that the modified wall confluent jets <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> can provide acceptable thermal comfort for the occupant with lower airflow rate compared to the conventional wall confluent jets <b>supply</b> <b>device.</b> Numerical predictions using three turbulence models (renormalization group (RNG k– ε), realizable (Re k– ε), and shear stress transport (SST k– ω) are evaluated by measurement results. The computational box and nozzle plate models are used to model the inlet boundary conditions of the nozzle device. In the isothermal study, the wall confluent jets in the primary region and the wall jet in the secondary region, when predicted by the three turbulence models, are in good agreement with the measurements. The non-isothermal validation studies show that the SST k– ω model is slightly better at predicting the wall confluent jets than the other two models. The SST k– ω model is used to investigate the effects of the nozzle diameter, number of nozzles, nozzle array configuration, and inlet discharge height on the ventilation performance of the proposed wall confluent jets <b>supply</b> <b>device.</b> The nozzle diameter and number of nozzles play important roles in determining the airflow pattern, temperature field, and draught distribution. Increased temperature stratification and less draught distribution are achieved by increasing the nozzle diameter and number of nozzles. The <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> with smaller nozzle diameters and fewer nozzles yields rather uniform temperature distribution due to the dominant effect of mixing. The flow behavior is nearly independent of the inlet discharge height for the studied range. The proposed wall confluent jets <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> is compared with a mixing <b>supply</b> <b>device,</b> impinging <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> and displacement <b>supply</b> <b>device.</b> The results show that the proposed wall confluent jets <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> has the combined behavior of both mixing and stratification principles. The proposed wall confluent jets <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> provides better overall ventilation performance than the mixing and displacement supply devices used in this study. This study covers also another application of confluent jets that is based on impinging technology. The <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> under consideration has an array of round jets on a curve. Multiple jets issue from the <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> aperture, in which the <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> is positioned vertically and the jets are directed against a target wall. The flow behavior and ventilation performance of the impinging confluent jets <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> is studied experimentally in an industrial premise. The results show that the impinging confluent jets <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> maintains acceptable thermal comfort in the occupied zone by creating well-distributed airflow during cold and hot seasons...|$|E

40|$|A well-functioning, {{energy-efficient}} {{ventilation system}} is of vital importance to offices, {{not only to}} {{provide the kind of}} comfortable, healthy indoor environment necessary for the well-being and productive work performance of occupants, but also to reduce energy use in buildings and the associated impact of CO 2 emissions on the environment. To achieve these goals impinging jet ventilation has been developed as an innovative ventilation concept. In an impinging jet ventilation system, a high momentum of air jet is discharged downwards, strikes the floor and spreads over it, thus distributing the fresh air along the floor {{in the form of a}} very thin shear layer. This system retains advantages of mixing and stratification from conventional air distribution methods, while capable of overcoming their shortcomings. The aim of this thesis is to reach a thorough understanding of impinging jet ventilation for providing a good thermal environment for an office, by using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) supported by detailed measurements. The full-field measurements were carried out in two test rooms located in a large enclosure giving relatively stable climate conditions. This study has been divided into three parts where the first focuses on validation of numerical investigations against measurements, the second addresses impacts of a number of design parameters on the impinging jet flow field and thermal comfort level, and the third compares ventilation performance of the impinging jet <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> with other air supply devices intended for mixing, wall confluent jets and displacement ventilation, under specific room conditions. In the first part, velocity and temperature distributions of the impinging jet flow field predicted by different turbulence models are compared with detailed measurements. Results from the non-isothermal validation studies show that the accuracy of the simulation results is to a great extent dependent on the complexity of the turbulence models, due to complicated flow phenomena related to jet impingement, such as recirculation, curvature and instability. The v 2 -f turbulence model shows the best performance with measurements, which is slightly better than the SST k-ω model but much better than the RNG k-ε model. The difference is assumed to be essentially related to the magnitude of turbulent kinetic energy predicted in the vicinity of the stagnation region. Results from the isothermal study show that both the SST k-ω and RNG k-ε models predict similar wall jet behaviours of the impinging jet flow. In the second part, three sets of parametric studies were carried out by using validated CFD models. The first parametric study shows that the geometry of the air supply system has the most significant impact on the flow field. The rectangular air <b>supply</b> <b>device,</b> especially the one with larger aspect ratio, provides a longer penetration distance to the room, which is suitable for industrial ventilation. The second study reveals that the interaction effect of cooling ceiling, heat sources and impinging jet ventilation results in complex flow phenomena but with a notable feature of air circulation, which consequently decreases thermal stratification in the room and increases draught discomfort at the foot level. The third study demonstrates the advantage of using response surface methodology to study simultaneous effects on changes in four parameters, i. e. shape of air <b>supply</b> <b>device,</b> jet discharge height, supply airflow rate and supply air temperature. Analysis of the flow field reveals that at a low discharge height, the shape of air <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> has a major impact on the flow pattern in the vicinity of the <b>supply</b> <b>device.</b> Correlations between the studied parameters and local thermal discomfort indices were derived. Supply airflow rates and temperatures are shown to be the most important parameter for draught and stratification discomfort, respectively. In the third part, the impinging jet <b>supply</b> <b>device</b> was shown to provide a better overall performance than other air supply devices used for mixing, wall confluent jets and displacement ventilation, with respect to thermal comfort, heat removal effectiveness, air exchange efficiency and energy-saving potential related to fan power...|$|E
