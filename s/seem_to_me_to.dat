5|$|On atheism, Sagan commented in 1981: An atheist {{is someone}} who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has {{compelling}} evidence against the existence of God. I know of no such compelling evidence. Because God can be relegated to remote times and places and to ultimate causes, {{we would have to}} know a great deal more about the universe than we do now to be sure that no such God exists. To be certain of the existence of God and to be certain of the nonexistence of God <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be the confident extremes in a subject so riddled with doubt and uncertainty as to inspire very little confidence indeed.|$|E

500|$|..... these {{poems are}} all in a {{particular}} set form which I have elaborated, and the word [...] "quartet" [...] does <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> start people {{on the right track}} for understanding them ("sonata" [...] in any case is too musical). It suggests to me the notion of making a poem by weaving in together three or four superficially unrelated themes: the [...] "poem" [...] being the degree of success in making a new whole out of them.|$|E
500|$|Boyd {{has said}} that he prefers to believe the {{overdose}} was accidental. He recalled that Drake's parents had described his mood in the preceding weeks as having been very positive, and that he had planned to move back to London to restart his music career. Boyd believes that this uplift in spirits was followed by a [...] "crash back into despair". Reasoning that Drake may have taken a high dosage of antidepressants to recapture this sense of optimism, he said he prefers to imagine Drake [...] "making a desperate lunge for life rather than a calculated surrender to death". Writing in 1975, NME journalist Nick Kent commented on the irony of Drake's death {{at a time when he}} had just begun to regain a sense of [...] "personal balance". In contrast, Gabrielle Drake has said she prefers to think her brother committed suicide, [...] "in the sense that I'd rather he died because he wanted to end it than it to be the result of a tragic mistake. That would <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be terrible." ...|$|E

2500|$|William Butler Yeats was {{generally}} critical of Poe, calling him [...] "vulgar." [...] Of [...] "The Pit and the Pendulum" [...] in particular he said, [...] " [...] not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> have permanent literary value of any kind... Analyse the Pit and the Pendulum {{and you find}} {{an appeal to the}} nerves by tawdry physical affrightments." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a November 2002 {{interview}} Pullman {{was asked}} to respond {{to the fact that the}} Catholic Herald had called his books [...] "the stuff of nightmares" [...] and [...] "worthy of the bonfire". He replied: [...] "My response to that was to ask the publishers to print it in the next book, which they did! I think it's comical, it's just laughable". The original remark in Catholic Herald (which was [...] "there are numerous candidates that <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be far more worthy of the bonfire than Harry Potter") was written in the context of parents in South Carolina pressing their Board of Education to ban the Harry Potter books.|$|E

2500|$|My {{response}} {{is that when}} Creationists talk about God creating every individual species as a separate act, they always instance hummingbirds, or orchids, sunflowers and beautiful things. But I tend to think instead of a parasitic worm that is boring through {{the eye of a}} boy sitting on the bank of a river in West Africa, [...] that's going to make him blind. And , 'Are you telling me that the God you believe in, who you also say is an all-merciful God, who cares for each one of us individually, are you saying that God created this worm that can live in no other way than in an innocent child's eyeball? Because that doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> coincide with a God who's full of mercy'.|$|E
2500|$|During 1979, von Balthasar distanced {{himself from}} a {{newspaper}} attack on Opus Dei which had cited his earlier accusations of integrism. [...] He wrote in a personal letter to the Prelature, sent also to the Neue Zürcher Zeitung, that [...] "because of my lack of concrete information, I am not able to give an informed opinion about Opus Dei today. On the other hand, one thing strikes me as obvious: many of the criticisms levelled against the movement, including those of your own journal concerning the religious instruction given by Opus Dei members, <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be false and anti-clerical." [...] Von Balthasar maintained his unfavourable judgment of Escrivá's spirituality and repeated it in a television interview during 1984, {{but he did not}} renew his criticism of Opus Dei as an organization.|$|E
2500|$|Nkrumah {{returned}} to London in May 1945 and {{enrolled at the}} London School of Economics as a PhD candidate in anthropology. He withdrew after one term {{and the next year}} enrolled at University College, with the intent to write a philosophy dissertation on [...] "Knowledge and Logical Positivism". His supervisor, A. J. Ayer, declined to rate Nkrumah as a [...] "first-class philosopher", saying, [...] "I liked him and enjoyed talking to him but he did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> have an analytical mind. He wanted answers too quickly. I think part of the trouble may have been that he wasn't concentrating very hard on his thesis. It was a way of marking time until the opportunity came for him to return to Ghana." [...] Finally, Nkrumah enrolled in, but did not complete, a study in law at Gray's Inn.|$|E

2500|$|On 3 March 1953, Powell spoke {{against the}} Royal Titles Bill in the House of Commons. He {{said he found}} three major changes to {{the style of the}} United Kingdom, [...] "all of which <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be evil". The first one was [...] "that in this title, for the first time, will be {{recognised}} a principle hitherto never admitted in this country, namely, the divisibility of the crown". Powell said that the unity of the realm had evolved over centuries and included the British Empire: [...] "It was a unit because it had one Sovereign. There was one Sovereign: one realm". He feared that by [...] "recognising the division of the realm into separate realms, are we not opening the way for that other remaining unity-–the last unity of all—that of the person, to go the way of the rest?" ...|$|E
2500|$|More {{than thirty}} years after The Naked Civil Servant, Hurt reprised the role of Quentin Crisp in the 2009 film An Englishman in New York. This {{television}} film depicts Crisp's later years in New York. He returned to Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, playing the on-screen Big Brother for the Paper Zoo Theatre Company's stage adaptation of the novel in June 2009. The theatre production premiered at the National Media Museum, in Bradford and toured during 2010. Hurt said, [...] "I think Paper Zoo {{thought it would be}} quite ironic to have the person who played Winston having risen in the party. From the Chestnut Tree Cafe, he's managed to get his wits together again, now understanding that 2 and 2 make 5, and becomes Big Brother. So it tickled my fancy, and of course I looked up Paper Zoo, and they <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be the sort of company that's essential in the country as we know it, and doing a lot of really good stuff." ...|$|E
