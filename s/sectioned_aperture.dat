Their infrastructure is built around access points, either short range (802. 11), intermediate range (802. 16, Mobile Communications) or long range (wireless links). As the gain of those gets larger, the concern about the possible adverse effect of electromagnetic radiation on human health grows also. Therefore various methods are being developed for the fast and accurate field estimation in the vicinity of such installments. In this thesis the Near Field of large Reflector and Mobile Base Station Antennas is studied. First, the exact characteristics of the near field of circular and elliptical cross <b>section</b> <b>apertures</b> are presented, and an approximate method for its fast estimation is developed. This method is based on finding an aperture with the same half power beam widths at the two main radiation planes, as the one under study. The equivalent aperture has uniform excitation, so that its field can be calculated fast and therefore also smaller dimensions than the original one. Numerous diagrams are given establishing the equivalence claimed in the near field zone. The same method is modified and applied to antennas of smaller electrical dimensions, as the ones in mobile base stations. In this case the antenna is split into distinct radiation centers, since it has a broader main lobe and higher side lobes in the far field. The equivalence is established for each one of them with a uniform excited aperture, considering again as equivalence criterion the half power beam width equalization of the radiation centers under study with the equivalent uniform excited apertures. It is also shown how the far field lobes emanate from energy flow tubes with their origin in the near zone as a result of constructive and destructive interference. The equivalent method is applied on a real base station antenna (Powerwave 7721. 00) and the results are compared with the exact solution of the Method of Moments and measurements. Finally simulations for the near field estimation of base station antennas through dipole probes are performed. Conclusions are drawn as far as the length of the probes is concerned and the best way of combining their currents (in case of probes consisting of more than one dipole) {{in order to get the}} most reliable estimation of the total field magnitude in the near zone. ...|$|R

The transverse slots on the broad and end waveguide walls analyzed in this paper are decomposed into three structures: two apertures and an auxiliary waveguide <b>section.</b> The slot <b>aperture</b> in the host waveguide is modeled as an inductance-capacitance-transformer (LCT) combination, for which the equivalent inductance and capacitance are determined by first considering the case of zero-thickness slot, then the transformer turns ratio is calculated for the slot on a finite thickness wall. The effect of the wall thickness is accounted for by a waveguide section having cross-sectional dimensions equal {{to those of the}} slot, and length equal to the wall thickness. The loaded slot aperture is modeled along with the external load as a lumped load impedance. Expressions for the inductance, capacitance and transformer turns ratio are obtained in terms of the slot length and width.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} design, development, calibration and performance {{evaluation of a}} pre-clinical imaging system called AdaptiSPECT. Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) systems are powerful tools for multiple applications in small-animal research, ranging from drug discovery to fundamental biology. Traditionally, pinhole SPECT systems are designed with fixed imaging characteristics in terms of sensitivity, resolution {{and size of the}} field of view, that are dictated by the hardware configuration of the system. The SPECT system described in this dissertation can change its hardware configuration in response to the subject data it is acquiring in order to improve the imaging performance. We employed 16 modular gamma-ray detectors, each of which consists of a NaI:Tl scintillation crystal, a fused silica lightguide, and an array of 9 PMTs. The camera is designed to work with maximum-likelihood position estimation methods. These detectors are arranged into 2 rings of 8 detectors around an adjustable pinhole aperture. The aperture itself comprises three cylinders of different diameters, each with pinholes of different diameters. The three aperture cylinders are stacked together along the imager axis, and selection of the appropriate ring of pinholes is carried out by translating the entire aperture assembly. In addition, some <b>sections</b> of the <b>aperture</b> are fitted with shutters to open or close additional pinholes that increase sensitivity. We reviewed the method used to calibrate AdaptiSPECT, and proposed a new interpolation scheme specific to adaptive SPECT imaging systems where the detectors can move to multiple locations, that yields system matrices for any configuration employed during adaptive imaging. We evaluated the performances of AdaptiSPECT for various configurations. The magnification of the system ranges from 1. 2 to 11. 1. The corresponding resolution ranges from 3. 2 mm to 0. 6 mm, and the corresponding transaxial field-of-view ranges from 84 mm to 10 mm. The sensitivity of the system varies from 220 cps/MBq to 340 cps/MBq for various configurations. Imaging of a mouse injected with a bone radiotracer revealed the finer structures that can be acquired at higher magnifications, and illustrated the ability to conveniently image with a variety of magnifications during the same study. In summary, we have brought the concept of an adaptive SPECT imaging system as it was originally described by Barrett et al. in 2008 to life. We have engineered a system that can switch configurations with speed, precision, and repeatability suitable to carry out adaptive imaging studies on small animals, thus opening the door to a new research and medical imaging paradigm in which the imager hardware is adjusted on the fly to maximize task-performance for a specific patient, not, as currently, an ensemble of patients...|$|R
40|$|Mutual Coupling Program for Circular Waveguide-fed Aperture Array (CWG) was {{developed}} to calculate the electromagnetic interaction between elements of an antenna array of circular apertures with specified aperture field distributions. The field distributions were {{assumed to be a}} superposition of the modes which could exist in a circular waveguide. Various external media were included to provide flexibility of use, for example, the flexibility {{to determine the effects of}} dielectric covers (i. e., thermal protection system tiles) upon the impedance of aperture type antennas. The impedance and radiation characteristics of planar array antennas depend upon the mutual interaction between all the elements of the array. These interactions are influenced by several parameters (e. g., the array grid geometry, the geometry and excitation of each array element, the medium outside the array, and the internal network feeding the array.) For the class of array antenna whose radiating elements consist of small holes in a flat conducting plate, the electromagnetic problem can be divided into two parts, the internal and the external. In solving the external problem for an array of circular apertures, CWG will compute the mutual interaction between various combinations of circular modal distributions and apertures. CWG computes the mutual coupling between various modes assumed to exist in circular apertures that are located in a flat conducting plane of infinite dimensions. The apertures can radiate into free space, a homogeneous medium, a multilayered region or a reflecting surface. These apertures are assumed to be excited by one or more modes corresponding to the modal distributions in circular waveguides of the same cross <b>sections</b> as the <b>apertures.</b> The apertures may be of different sizes and also of different polarizations. However, the program assumes that each aperture field contains the same modal distributions, and calculates the complex scattering matrix between all mode and aperture combinations. The scattering matrix can then be used to determine the complex modal field amplitudes for each aperture with a specified array excitation. CWG is written in VAX FORTRAN for DEC VAX series computers running VMS (LAR- 15236) and IBM PC series and compatible computers running MS-DOS (LAR- 15226). It requires 360 K of RAM for execution. To compile the source code for the PC version, the NDP Fortran compiler and linker will be required; however, the distribution medium for the PC version of CWG includes a sample MS-DOS executable which was created using NDP Fortran with the -vms compiler option. The standard distribution medium for the PC version of CWG is a 3. 5 inch 1. 44 Mb MS-DOS format diskette.

40|$|Concentrated {{solar energy}} can be {{utilised}} for many thermal processes that require high temperatures. A solar receiver {{is one such}} device that receives concentrated solar radiation. Different types of solar receivers such as fluidised beds, packed beds and solid particle solar receivers are used in different thermal applications. The focus {{of this study is}} to investigate the flow behaviour in a Fluidised Bed Solar Receiver (FBSR). One of the major limitations in the use of an FBSR under direct irradiation is particle deposition on the receiver glass window. This has two consequences: it reduces solar radiation transmission into the receiver and results in the failure of the glass window. There have been a number of investigations on mitigating particle depositions onto the glass windows of solar receivers. However, the aerodynamics of solar receivers using particles is still not well understood. The aim of this project is to mitigate particle deposition on the glass window of an FBSR by developing a better understanding of the flow patterns under different operating conditions, which can assist in the development of an aerodynamic seal. Continuous operation of the FBSR can result in particle deposition on the glass window, which is directly related to the flow behaviour of the receiver. Therefore, it is essential that the flow pattern in an FBSR is investigated under single and two-phase flow conditions. Analysing the flow behaviours under various conditions, enables the mechanisms of particle deposition on a glass window to be understood. Due to the complexity of the actual FBSR, a scaled FBSR was selected for this study. A well-defined and uniform in-flow condition was introduced below the aperture of the receiver. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) were utilised to model the flow under gaseous and particle-laden conditions. The Renormalised Group Theory (RNG) -based k-ε turbulence model was used to capture the flow pattern at steady conditions. The Discrete Particle Model (DPM) was used to investigate the two-phase flow behaviour. The single phase flow results were validated against experimental data collected inside a similar device operating under the same conditions. The turbulent flow velocity was measured using a Turbulent Flow Instrumentation (TFI) cobra probe and a Pitot tube. The three-dimensional velocity components were measured at different radial and axial positions in the receiver for different Reynolds numbers. The FBSR was oriented vertically; consisting of a cylindrical cavity, above which were located a converging-diverging secondary cavity and a window glass. The bottom of the FBSR was considered as an inlet, with two tangential outlets placed closer to the secondary cavity. The results of this investigation revealed that mass flow into the secondary concentrator of the receiver was reduced significantly when the ratio between the outlets and inlet areas was 0. 5, and the ratio between the aperture and receiver diameter was 0. 41. Since the glass window was located at the top of the secondary concentrator, the lower circulation of the inlet flow into the secondary concentrator resulted in lower particle deposition on the glass window. When using window shielding jets, the number of jets were found to be critical for preventing particle deposition. At a constant mass flow rate, increasing the number of window shielding jets reduced the suction pressure from the core to the aperture. Consequently, the outward axial velocity towards the glass window was reduced. It was found that the introduction of particles into the flow influenced the flow pattern inside the receiver and affected the flow velocity on the glass window. In a gas-particle flow analysis, gravity was found to be important for capturing the flow patterns in the receiver accurately. When assessing the effect of particles on flow patterns under the same operating conditions, it was found that the average outward axial velocity, the maximum velocity and the aperture area with outward axial velocity were higher than for a single-phase flow. Apart from the <b>aperture</b> <b>section,</b> the slip velocity was found to be negligible in the receiver cavity, as is evident from the comparison of the fluid and particles’ velocity profiles. The findings of this investigation could potentially provide insights into the industrial application of FBSR, where the particles damage the glass window of the receiver during long-term operation.

40|$|Images {{of astronomical}} objects {{captured}} by ground-based telescopes are {{distorted by the}} earth's atmosphere. The atmosphere consists of random time-varying layers of air of differing density and hence refractive index. These refractive index fluctuations cause wavefronts that propagate through the atmosphere to become aberrated, resulting in a loss in resolution of the astronomical images. The wavefront aberrations that are induced by the atmosphere can be compensated by either real-time adaptive optics, where a deformable mirror {{is placed in the}} optical path, or by computer post-processing algorithms on the distorted images. In an adaptive optics system, the wavefront sensor is the element that estimates the wavefront phase aberration. The wavefront cannot be measured directly, and instead an aberration is introduced to the optical path to produce two or more intensity distributions, from which the wavefront slope or curvature can be estimated. Wavefront sensing is one of the topics of this thesis. A number of computer post-processing algorithms exist to deblur astronomical images, such as phase diversity, deconvolution from wavefront sensing (DWFS) and phase retrieval, with improvements to the latter two published in this thesis. The pyramid wavefront sensor consists of a four-sided glass prism placed in the focal plane of the telescope, which subdivides the focal plane in four, and a relay lens which re-images the four sections of the focal plane to form four images of the aperture at the conjugate aperture plane. The wavefront slope is estimated as a linear combination of the aperture images. The pyramid sensor can be generalised to a class of N-sided glass prism wavefront sensors that subdivide the focal plane into N equal <b>sections,</b> forming N <b>aperture</b> images at the conjugate aperture plane. The minimum number of sides required to estimate the slope in two orthogonal directions is three, and the cone sensor is derived by letting N tend to infinity. Simulation results show that in the presence of photon, but not read, noise the cone sensor provides the best wavefront estimate. For the pyramid sensor, the wavefront is typically reconstructed from the estimate of the wavefront slope in two orthogonal directions. Some information is inherently lost when the four measurements (aperture images) are reduced to two slope estimates. A new method is proposed to reconstruct the wavefront directly from the aperture images, removing the intermediate step of forming the slope estimates. Reconstructing the wavefront directly from the images is shown through simulation of atmospheric phase screens to give a better wavefront estimate than reconstructing from the slope estimates. This result is true for all pyramid type sensors tested. The pyramid wavefront sensor can be generalised by placing the lenslet array at the focal plane to subdivide the complex field in the focal plane into more than four sections. Using this framework, the pyramid sensor can be considered as the dual of the Shack Hartmann sensor, which subdivides the aperture plane with a lenslet array, since the two sensors subdivide each one of a Fourier pair. Both sensors estimate the wavefront slope with a centroid operator on the low resolution images. Also, in both sensors there exists a trade-off between the spatial resolution obtainable and the accuracy of the slope estimates. This trade-off is determined {{by the size of the}} lenslets in the array for both sensors, and is inverted between the two sensors. Simulation results run in open loop demonstrate that the lenslet array at the aperture (Shack-Hartmann) and focal (pyramid) planes do provide wavefront estimates of equivalent quality. The lenslet array at the focal plane, however, can be modulated so as to increase its linear range and thus provide a better wavefront estimate than the Shack-Hartmann sensor in open loop simulations. Phase retrieval is a non-linear iterative technique that is used to recover the phase in the aperture plane from intensity measurements at the focal plane and other constraints. A novel phase retrieval algorithm, which subdivides the focal plane of the telescope with a lenslet array and uses the aperture images formed at the conjugate aperture plane as a magnitude constraint, is proposed. This algorithm is more heavily constrained than conventional phase retrieval or phase retrieval in conjunction with the Shack-Hartmann sensor, with constraints applied at three Fourier planes: the aperture, focal and conjugate aperture planes. The subdivision of the focal plane means that the ambiguity problem that exists in other phase retrieval algorithms between an object A(x,y) and its twin A* (x,y) is removed, and this is supported by simulation results. Simulation results also show that the performance of the algorithm is dependent on the starting point, and that starting with the linear estimate from the aperture images gives a better wavefront estimate than starting with zero phase. DWFS is a computer post-processing algorithm that combines the distorted image and wavefront sensing measurements in order to compensate the image for the atmospheric turbulence. An accurate calibration of the reference positions for the centroids of the Shack-Hartmann sensor is essential for an accurate estimate of the wavefront and hence astronomical object, with DWFS. The conventional method for estimating these reference positions is to image a laser beam through the Shack-Hartmann lenslet array but not through the atmosphere. An alternative calibration technique is to observe a single bright star and optimise the Strehl ratio with respect to the reference positions. Results using DWFS on data captured at the Observatoire de Lyon show that this new technique can provide wavefront estimates of similar quality as the grid calibration technique, but without the need for a separate calibration laser...|$|R
