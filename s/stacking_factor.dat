50|$|The <b>stacking</b> <b>factor</b> {{is used in}} {{electrical}} transformer design. Since transformers {{are made up of}} metal sheets, almost always iron, they are laminated so they do not contact each other. This is done to reduce the intensity of eddy current losses in the core, while keeping a high flux carrying capacity. Between the metal sheets is a non-ferro-magnetic material, therefore, when calculating the flux density of the iron core this non-ferromagnetic material must be taken into account. The <b>stacking</b> <b>factor</b> gives an approximate number to how much of the core is effective when calculating flux.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed at}} studying {{the behavior of}} volume, dry weight, oil content and fence post quantity per diametric class of candeia; to define its <b>stack</b> <b>factor,</b> with and without diametric class control; and to determine equations for estimating the main stem and branches volume, dry weight and oil content of the hole tree, trunk, branches and leaves and fencepost quantity. Data were obtained from a forest inventory carried out in a native candeia forest located in Aiuruoca county, Minas Gerais state - Brazil. Tree volume was calculated through the Huber formula and oil extraction methods employed were “the solvent method” and “vapor hauling method”. For estimation volume, dry weight, oil content and fencepost number the traditional double entry models were used. The oil weight in 1 cubic meter of wood of small dimensions, trees between 5 and 10 cm, is around 6 kilos, while the oil content of the largest trees, between 40 and 45 cm, is around 11 kilos. The same tendency is observed for the wood volume, without bark, and in the volume of piled up wood, although in these last situations the magnitude of quantities are different. The oil content of candeia trees present the following behavior: in the stem and branches up to 3 cm of diameter with bark, it varies from 1, 02 % to 1, 37 %, respectively to plants with diameter between 5 and 10 cm and between 40 and 45 cm; in the branches with less than 3 cm of diameter with bark, it varies from 0, 33 % to 0, 65 %,respectively, to plants between 5 and 10 cm and between 40 and 45 cm of diameter; in the leaves it varies from 0, 28 % to 0, 77 %, respectively, for plants between 5 - 10 cm and between 40 - 45 cm of diameter. The average <b>stack</b> <b>factor</b> is 1. 9087 and diminishes as diameter classes increases.

40|$|Originally {{identified}} as Golgi <b>stacking</b> <b>factors</b> in vitro, the Golgi reassembly stacking protein (GRASP) {{family has been}} shown to act as membrane tethers with multiple cellular roles. As an update to previous comprehensive reviews of the GRASP family (Giuliani et al., 2011; Vinke et al., 2011; Jarvela and Linstedt, 2012), we outline here the latest findings concerning their diverse roles. New insights into the mechanics of GRASP-mediated tethering come from recent crystal structures. The models of how GRASP 65 and GRASP 55 tether membranes relate directly to their role in Golgi ribbon formation in mammalian cells and the unlinking of the ribbon at the onset of mitosis.

40|$|The {{mammalian}} GRASPs (Golgi reassembly stacking proteins) GRASP 65 and GRASP 55 {{were first}} discovered {{more than a}} decade ago as factors involved in the stacking of Golgi cisternae. Since then, orthologues have been identified in many different organisms and GRASPs have been assigned new roles that may seem disconnected. In vitro, GRASPs have been shown to have the biochemical properties of Golgi <b>stacking</b> <b>factors,</b> but the jury is still out as to whether they act as such in vivo. In mammalian cells, GRASP 65 and GRASP 55 are required for formation of the Golgi ribbon, a structure which is fragmented in mitosis owing to the phosphorylation of a number of serine and threonine residues situated in its C-terminus. Golgi ribbon unlinking is in turn shown to be part of a mitotic checkpoint. GRASP 65 also seems to be the key target of signalling events leading to re-orientation of the Golgi during cell migration and its breakdown during apoptosis. Interestingly, the Golgi ribbon is not a feature of lower eukaryotes, yet a GRASP homologue is present in the genome of Encephalitozoon cuniculi, suggesting they have other roles. GRASPs have no identified function in bulk anterograde protein transport along the secretory pathway, but some cargo-specific trafficking roles for GRASPs have been discovered. Furthermore, GRASP orthologues have recently been shown to mediate the unconventional secretion of the cytoplasmic proteins AcbA/Acb 1, in both Dictyostelium discoideum and yeast, and the Golgi bypass of a number of transmembrane proteins during Drosophila development.

However, the risk of mortality according to the number of these disease states present is unknown. We sought to determine the impact of concomitant, multiple risk <b>factors</b> (<b>stacked</b> risks) for pneumococcal disease on 30 -day mortality in adults. Methods This was a national case-control study of unvaccinated older Veterans (≥ 50 years of age) admitted to Veterans Affairs medical centers from 2002 to 2011 with serious pneumococcal infections (pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis) based on positive S. pneumoniae blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or respiratory cultures, respectively. Cases were those not alive 30 days following culture, while controls were alive. Using logistic regression, we quantified risk of 30 -day mortality among patients with <b>stacked</b> risk <b>factors,</b> including age ≥ 65 years, alcohol abuse, chronic heart disease, chronic liver disease, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes mellitus, immunodeficiency, and smoking. Results We identified 9730 serious pneumococcal infections, with an overall 30 -day mortality rate of 18. 6 % (1764 cases, 7966 controls). Infection types included pneumonia (62 %), bacteremia (26 %), and bacteremic pneumonia (11 %). Along with eight individual risk factors, we assessed 247 combinations of risk factors. Most cases (85 %) and controls (74 %) had at least two risk factors. Mortality increased as risks were stacked, up to six risk factors (one: OR 1. 5, CI 1. 08 – 2. 07; two: OR 2. 01, CI 1. 47 – 2. 75; three: OR 2. 71, CI 1. 99 – 3. 69; four: OR 3. 27, CI 2. 39 – 4. 47; five: OR 3. 63, CI 2. 60 – 5. 07; six: OR 4. 23, CI 2. 69 – 6. 65), with each additional risk factor increasing mortality an average of 55 % (± 13 %).

40|$|In vitro assays {{identified}} the Golgi peripheral protein GRASP 65 as a Golgi <b>stacking</b> <b>factor</b> that links adjacent Golgi cisternae by forming mitotically regulated trans -oligomers. These conclusions, however, require further confirmation in the cell. In this study, {{we showed that}} the first 112 amino acids at the N-terminus (including the first PDZ domain, PDZ 1) of the protein are sufficient for oligomerization. Systematic electron microscopic analysis showed that the expression of non-regulatable GRASP 65 mutants in HeLa cells enhanced Golgi stacking in interphase and inhibited Golgi fragmentation during mitosis. Depletion of GRASP 65 by small interference RNA (siRNA) {{reduced the number of}} cisternae in the Golgi stacks; this reduction was rescued by expressing exogenous GRASP 65. These results provided evidence and a molecular mechanism by which GRASP 65 stacks Golgi cisternal membranes. Further experiments revealed that inhibition of mitotic Golgi disassembly by expressing non-regulatable GRASP 65 mutants did not affect equal partitioning of the Golgi membranes into the daughter cells. However, it delayed mitotic entry and suppressed cell growth; this effect was diminished by dispersing the Golgi apparatus with Brefeldin A treatment prior to mitosis, suggesting that Golgi disassembly at the onset of mitosis plays a role in cell cycle progression...|$|E
40|$|In this manuscript, a new {{stacking}} mode for micellar electrokinetic chromatography with anionic micelles {{and neutral}} analytes was investigated. The {{variation in the}} velocity of the analytes between the sample and the separation zones, needed for stacking effects, was obtained by using solvents with different polarities, the concentration of salts and micelles being identical between the two zones. Whereas a pure aqueous solvent {{was used in the}} injection zone, up to 30 % ACN was used in the separation zone. In such conditions, higher interactions between the analyte and the micelles are obtained in the sample zone than in the separation zone, this due to the presence of the organic solvent. As the velocity of neutral analyte depends on its interactions with the moving micelles, its speed will drop when crossing two distinct zones where in the second zone its interactions with the micelles are lower than in the outgoing zone. This will induce a stacking effect. This approach was validated using a background electrolyte in the separation zone made with 10 mM disodium hydrogen phosphate, 15 mM sodium dodecyl sulphate and 15 % ACN. The three triazines (simazine, atrazine, and terbuthylazine), used as test analytes, were dissolved in 10 mM disodium hydrogen phosphate, 15 mM sodium dodecyl sulphate and either 15 or 0 % ACN.

Based on the calorific value of the wood species S. paniculatum was considered favorable for the production of energy. The conclusion for E. urograndis the amount of phosphorus significantly influenced the mortality rate, growth in height, diameter and volume production. Considering all the spacing, the ratio between the volume and the amount of phosphorus is linear, V = 18. 5657 + 1, 3367 D, R? = 0. 9768.

Considering all the spacings model that best fit the data of biomass depending on the dosage was Biom = 8. 1120 + 0, 7204 D - R? = 0. 9885.

That is the reason fuel cell is considered as environmental friendly and efficient technology of future. Among various types of fuel cell, PEM fuel cell is the most diffused and popular type of market due to its sound features such as low operating temperature, quick variation according to load, high efficiency and better power density.

40|$|This thesis first {{explains}} the eddy current and {{the phenomenon of}} skin effect, where the resultant flux flows near {{the surface of the}} metal. A new flux direction perspective is created for steel laminations, from which derivations of the eddy current resistance and power losses in different directions are developed assuming uniform flux conditions. The developed method compares with a proposed theory through experimental data. The results from the comparison support the validity of the developed derivations. Two uniform flux generators and their billets construction are introduced. The power loss between two cubic billets with different orientations is compared. A Finite Element Analysis (FEA) program is used to show the difference between lamination alignments. To prove the validity of the developed theory, two experiments were performed using two different electroheating apparatus. The results give scale factors from which the theoretical values can be matched to the experimental ones. Due to the poorer construction of the first apparatus, the scale factor of measured to computed losses is 1. 15. The scale factor for the second apparatus can be taken as unity, revealing a good match between theory and measurements. After verification of the developed equations for uniform flux experiments, the focus of the eddy current loss calculation turned to partial core transformers. The flux background of a cubical core is reviewed. Three key factors (L', Kec and βa) are introduced into the eddy current power loss model. L' is a length which indicates the region of the flux spreading at the ends of the core. Kec as a ratio indicates how much of the main flux spreads at the ends of the core. βa is the ratio of the winding axial length and winding thickness. Using simulations from the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) program MagNet, a partial core side view with the flux distribution and flux density from two orthogonal angles is created. A flux linkage comparison between the experimental results and the returned values from MagNet verifies the high accuracy of the flux plot in MagNet. The eddy current power loss model is then built up with equations. The relationships amongst the three key factors are studied and confirmed using the experimental results. Normally, a partial core transformer uses a cylindrical partial core rather than a cubical partial core, {{to reduce the amount of}} winding material. Therefore, a further goal was to prove the developed model for cylindrical partial core transformers. The construction differences between the cubical and cylindrical core is discussed. The orthogonal flux assumptions for the cylindrical core in two directions are reviewed. The flux penetration between two adjacent blocks is considered and explained. The mathematical core loss model is created for a cylindrical core composing by ten blocks. Three tests were performed using the developed core loss model. The results visualize the power loss from the core by its temperature distribution, and consequently prove the validity of the developed core loss model. An eddy current loss comparison and the discussion are made between the previous method and the developed method. Overall, the results confirm a significant improvement using the developed core loss model, and a generic form of the partial core can be used for designing future models of partial core transformers which have a <b>stacking</b> <b>factor</b> greater than 0. 96...|$|E
40|$|The {{extensive}} research {{effort in the}} development of high-Tc superconducting (HTSC) class-II (Bi,Pb) 2 Sr 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 Ox+ 10 (Bi(Pb) - 2223) coils, and magnets, through processing optimization, and characterization of silver, and silver-alloy composite tapes, has been conducted at the Center for Superconducting and Electronic Materials (part of the Institute of Materials Technology and Manufacturing), Department of Materials Engineering, University of Wollongong. Studies leading up to the production of Bi(Pb) - 2223 class-II coils, and magnets include the following investigations in materials processing, and science of Bi(Pb) - 2223 composite tapes:- The processing of Bi(Pb) - 2223 short, and long length composite tapes (from the standard procedure of PIT, to the conventional method of CTFF, and the novel format of WIT, or wire-in-tube), and the characterization on their physical, chemical, electrical, and magnetic properties by means of measurements - implemented techniques include; Vickers microhardness tests (HyT), particle size analysis (PSA), Xray diffraction (XRD), differential thermal and thermo-gravimetric analysis (DTA/TG), scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectrometry (SEM/EDS), electrical transport, ac-susceptibility, and the SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) magnetometry. The effect of powder packing density, using the conventional method of powder-intube (PIT) by various means, on the transport critical current density, Jc, mechanical properties, and high-Tc phase (2223) formation of Bi(Pb) - 2223 single filamentary (SF) superconducting tapes - higher initial packing density of PIT monocore short tapes has been found to give higher Jc values, as well as higher rate of 2223 formation, while lower initial packing density samples gave better mechanical performance. Critical strains for bend tests showed a dependence on the core thickness, and silver/oxide volume ratio. The effect of sintering periods on the microstructure, phase development, and electrical transport and magnetic properties of Bi(Pb) - 2223 SF tapes - comparisons have been made between three batches of tapes with the same thermomechanical deformation, and sintering conditions, but with the starting precursor powders being different in their synthesis. It has been found that the volume density of the macroscopic pinning force in fields up to IT is greater for a particular sintering period, viz. 60 h in duration. Resistivity measurements further showed that the pinning activation energy also reaches a higher value for the same sintering period chosen. Scanning electron microimages of the fractured surfaces indicated that better core morphology, and density can be achieved in SF tapes from using this particular sintering period. Prolong sintering has been found to lead to greater porosity, while short duration sintering inhibits grain growth, which is undesirable for not providing sufficient time for the healing of cracks, induced during the intermediate deformation between sintering periods. The results also showed that longer sintering periods (of duration 3 ̆e= 100 h) tend to give better grain growth (in terms of grain size), but greater grain misalignment. Prolong sintering however, has been found to facilitate the increase in porosity of the core due to random grain growth. Critical currents in tapes treated with long sintering periods also have been measured to be lower in comparison with the values obtained for samples treated with slightly shorter sintering periods. The tapes made using 2 ̆ 7 threeto- four-sinter-period 2 ̆ 7 (each period 60 h) showed superior electrical transport properties over the 2 ̆ 7 two-sinter-period 2 ̆ 7 (each period 3 ̆e= 100 h) tapes, and revealed less microcracks in comparison with the 2 ̆ 7 five-to-six-sinter-period 2 ̆ 7 (each period 40 h) tapes. These attributes are the result of higher core density with better connected and aligned grains, owing to sufficient sintering time for each period of heat treatment. The effect of intermediate rolling reduction on the transport property, microstructure, phase formation and fill factor of Bi(Pb) - 2223 composite tapes - well controlled intermediate deformation between sintering stages of Bi(Pb) - 2223 composite tapes is crucial in achieving high critical current density. This deformation whether by rolling or pressing, depends on factors such as the compositional phase, the degree of microcracks, sintering periods or duration, and sintering temperature. It has been investigated that there is indeed an optimal 2 ̆ 7 window 2 ̆ 7 of reduction for intermediate rolling (at room temperature) between sintering stages. For a particular sintering temperature, this window has been determined to vary depending on the time of sintering and phase composition after a certain sintering period. It has been found that the amount of intermediate deformation controls the transformation rate of 2223, as well as determining the tape 2 ̆ 7 s final microstructure and fill factor. Mechanical property, and filamentary configuration of Bi(Pb) - 2223 composite tapes - mutifilamentary (MF) tapes prepared by both methods of oxide-powder-in-tube (OPIT), and continuous-tube-forming-filling (CTFF) technique with reproducible, and scalable transport critical current densities between 15 and 20 kA/cm 2 (77 K, self field, 1 μ V/cm) by rolling have been achieved. It has been found that the filament distribution (geometry of filaments), the fill factor (ratio of superconducting ceramic core to the total cross-section of the conductor), and the <b>stacking</b> <b>factor</b> (number of times the filaments are stacked) play a crucial roll in determining the overall mechanical and electrical performance of these tapes. The determination of stability parameters for Bi(Pb) - 2223 composite tapes - with high upper critical fields, HTSC have been recognized as candidate materials for coil and magnet applications. High field devices at one time or another, when operated close to their rated limits, are often faced with instability problems which normally are of electrical, magnetic or mechanical nature. The determination of stability parameters therefore are of interest to the conductor designer which assists in the processing aspect of long length production of wires and tapes. It has been found that Bi(Pb) - 2223 /Ag tapes are cryostabled, as well as flux-jump stabled. Processing parameters such as intermediate deformation and fill factor, have found to have a direct effect on the stability outcome of these tapes. Thermal stability of Bi(Pb) - 2223 coils at 77 K - it has been found that the degree of thermal stability of Bi(Pb) - 2223 /Ag pancake-shaped coils at 77 K can be determined by controlling the amount of matrix and superconducting materials during processing. The intermediate deformation step between sintering stages {{has been found to be}} crucial in optimizing the performance of the processed composite tapes as well as governing the thermal stability of the subsequently produced pancake-shaped coils. Results obtained from numerical analysis by the finite element method has shown that monolayer coils produced from Bi(Pb) - 2223 /Ag composite tapes are thermally very stable, with high values of fill factor. Increasing the number of co-wound tapes however, for reasons of achieving higher current carrying capacity, and improving in mechanical integrity of the coil or magnet system, has been found to require either a reduction in the fill factor or an increase in cooling rate for thermal stability to be sustained as would otherwise be achieved with the metallurgically same single tape. Development of Bi(Pb) - 2223 class-II coils and magnets - once the production of high quality long length Bi(Pb) - 2223 /Ag tapes have been achieved considerations such as how to fabricate them into practical applications without degrading the performance of the tape becomes the major issues. The main problems concerned are usually related to the winding procedures (e. g. wind-react (W 2 ̆ 6 R) and react-wind (R 2 ̆ 6 W)), the insulating material, the construction or stacking of coils if they are pancake-shaped, and the study of quench propagation parameters. A novel W 2 ̆ 6 R solenoidal coil (reaching 973 ampere-turns) wound on an alumina ceramic tube generates a dc-field of 19 m T at 77 K has been produced together with five pancake-shaped coils, each generates an average of 5 m T at 77 K, destined for magnet construction with a possible combined calculated field of - 0. 04 T at 77 K (with liquid nitrogen as a coolant). Critical currents of superconducting silver, and silver-alloy composite double pancake coils of Bi(Pb) - 2223 have been measured at liquid nitrogen temperature. A critical current density of - 12. 5 kA/cm 2 has been measured for a coil fabricated from Bi(Pb) - 2223 /Ag composite tape of length 2. 2 m (342 Ampere-turns) using the W I T method. For coils made from alloys of silver (e. g. 0. 02...|$|E

However, {{much of this}} order is unnecessary: linearizability only requires that ele-ments are ordered if the insert methods ran in sequence. We propose a new approach which uses timestamping to avoid unnecessary ordering. Pairs of elements can be left unordered (represented by unordered timestamps) if their associated insert operations ran concurrently, and order im-posed as necessary by the eventual remove operations. We realise our approach in a new non-blocking data-structure, the TS (timestamped) stack. In experiments on x 86, the TS stack outperforms and outscales all its competi-tors – for example, it outperforms the elimination-backoff <b>stack</b> by <b>factor</b> of two. In our approach, more concurrency translates into less ordering, giving less-contended removal and thus higher performance and scalability. Despite this, the TS stack is linearizable with respect to stack semantics. The weak internal ordering in the TS stack presents a challenge when establishing linearizability: standard tech-niques such as linearization points work well when there exists a total internal order. We present a new stack theo-rem, mechanised in Isabelle, which characterises the order-ings sufficient to establish stack semantics. By applying our stack theorem, we show that the TS stack is indeed correct. Our theorem constitutes a new, generic proof technique for concurrent stacks, and it paves the way for future weakly-ordered data-structure designs. 1...|$|R
