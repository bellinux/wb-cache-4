5|$|Fungal {{diseases}} include wirestem, {{which causes}} weak or dying transplants; Fusarium yellows, which result in <b>stunted</b> and twisted plants with yellow leaves; and blackleg (see Leptosphaeria maculans), {{which leads to}} sunken areas on stems and gray-brown spotted leaves. The fungi Alternaria brassicae and A.brassicicola cause dark leaf spots in affected plants. They are both seedborne and airborne, and typically propagate from spores in infected plant debris left on the soil surface for up to twelve weeks after harvest. Rhizoctonia solani causes the post-emergence disease wirestem, resulting in killed seedlings ("damping-off"), root rot or <b>stunted</b> growth and smaller heads.|$|E
5|$|Retarded growth: Slow, or <b>stunted</b> growth. Most newborns {{with this}} {{syndrome}} are of normal birth weight and length, but will often slow {{within the first}} year.|$|E
5|$|Stela 61 is a late {{monument}} {{bearing the}} name Aj Took'. It is a <b>stunted</b> stela with a badly eroded portrait and a shortened date form that {{is equivalent to}} a date either in 899 or 909, probably the latter.|$|E
50|$|When {{a player}} {{does not wish}} to create a <b>stunt</b> from scratch, he or she may go to the <b>Stunt</b> Coordinator on <b>Stunt</b> Island. The <b>Stunt</b> Coordinator {{possesses}} a built-in list of 32 <b>stunt</b> scenes. If the player is participating in the optional <b>Stunt</b> Pilot of the Year competition, these <b>stunts</b> must be completed to improve ranking.|$|R

50|$|A <b>stunt</b> coordinator, {{usually an}} {{experienced}} <b>stunt</b> performer, is hired by a TV, film or theatre director or production company for <b>stunt</b> casting {{that is to}} arrange the casting (<b>stunt</b> players and <b>stunt</b> doubles) and performance of <b>stunts</b> for a film, television programme or a live audience.|$|R
5|$|At higher {{elevations}} above the lake (especially in rocky or exposed locations), the pine and fir tree forests are thinner, {{and the trees}} grow in a more <b>stunted</b> fashion; instead, shrubs and bushes, such as green manzanita (Arctostaphylos patula), dwarf mountain manzanita (Arctostaphylos neuadensis), and tan oak (Lithocarpus densiflorus) find areas and niches to grow.|$|E
5|$|Soil {{nutrient}} deficiencies {{can cause}} a variety of plant problems that range from malformed plants {{to a lack of}} head growth. Many insects are attracted to lettuce, including cutworms, which cut seedlings off at the soil line; wireworms and nematodes, which cause yellow, <b>stunted</b> plants; tarnished plant bugs and aphids, which cause yellow, distorted leaves; leafhoppers, which cause <b>stunted</b> growth and pale leaves; thrips, which turn leaves gray-green or silver; leafminers, which create tunnels within the leaves; flea beetles, which cut small holes in leaves and caterpillars, slugs and snails, which cut large holes in leaves. Mammals, including rabbits and groundhogs, also eat the plants. Lettuce contains several defensive compounds, including sesquiterpene lactones, and other natural phenolics such as flavonol and glycosides, which help to protect it against pests. Certain varieties contain more than others, and some selective breeding and genetic modification studies have focused on using this trait to identify and produce commercial varieties with increased pest resistance.|$|E
5|$|The Libyan anti-Gaddafist {{movement}} {{brought together}} a {{diverse array of}} groups, which had varied motives and objectives. It comprised monarchists {{and members of the}} old, pre-Gaddafist elite, conservative nationalists who backed his Arab nationalist agenda but opposed his left-wing economic reforms, technocrats who had their future prospects <b>stunted</b> by the coup, and Islamic fundamentalists who opposed his radical reforms.|$|E

50|$|The second <b>stunt</b> {{was meant}} to mentally {{challenge}} the contestants. The three most common types of <b>stunts</b> {{in the second round}} were eating <b>stunts,</b> animal <b>stunts,</b> and retrieval <b>stunts.</b> Eating <b>stunts</b> entailed ingesting vile animal parts, live bugs, or a blended concoction of multiple gross items; animal <b>stunts</b> entailed immersing one's head or entire body in animals considered to be disgusting or intimidating (such as rats, snakes, or worms).|$|R
5000|$|In 2001, {{the first}} [...] "World <b>Stunt</b> Awards" [...] were {{presented}} in Los Angeles by actor Alec Baldwin. The event had A-list stars presenting the statues to Hollywood's unsung heroes. Arnold Schwarzenegger was presented with the first [...] "Lifetime Achievement" [...] award.

The awards show hands out eight awards: Best Fight, Best Fire <b>Stunt,</b> Best High Work, Best Overall <b>Stunt</b> by a <b>Stunt</b> Man, Best Overall <b>Stunt</b> by a <b>Stunt</b> Woman, Best Speciality <b>Stunt,</b> Best Work with a Vehicle and Best <b>Stunt</b> Coordinator and/or 2nd Unit Director.|$|R
5|$|Within-crop diversity, a {{specific}} crop {{can result from}} various growing conditions, for example a crop growing in nutrient-poor soil {{is likely to have}} <b>stunted</b> growth than a crop growing in more fertile soil. The availability of water, soil pH level, and temperature similarly influence crop growth.|$|E
5|$|Bracken is {{very common}} in upland areas, Beech Fern in woods and other shaded {{locations}} and Scaly Male Fern in wooded or open areas. Wilsons Filmy-fern is a common upland variety in the Highlands, along with the Tunbridge Filmy-fern, Alpine Lady-fern and the rarer <b>stunted</b> form Newmanâ€™s Lady-fern (A. distentifolium var. flexile) which is endemic to Scotland. The Killarney Fern, once found on Arran {{was thought to be}} extinct in Scotland, but has been discovered on Skye in its gametophyte form.|$|E
5|$|High {{levels of}} {{molybdenum}} {{can interfere with}} the body's uptake of copper, producing copper deficiency. Molybdenum prevents plasma proteins from binding to copper, and it also increases the amount of copper that is excreted in urine. Ruminants that consume high levels of molybdenum suffer from diarrhea, <b>stunted</b> growth, anemia, and achromotrichia (loss of fur pigment). These symptoms can be alleviated by copper supplements, either dietary and injection. The effective copper deficiency, can be aggravated by excess sulfur.|$|E
50|$|Motorcycle <b>stunt</b> riding, often {{referred}} to as <b>stunting,</b> is a motorcycle sport characterized by <b>stunts</b> involving acrobatic maneuvering of the motorcycle and sometimes the rider. Common maneuvers in <b>stunt</b> riding include wheelies, stoppies, and burnouts. Sport bikes have become a common vehicle for <b>stunts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Where the {{programme}} {{requires a}} <b>stunt,</b> and {{involves the use}} of <b>stunt</b> performers, the <b>stunt</b> coordinator arranges casting and performance for the <b>stunt,</b> working closely with the television director.|$|R
50|$|The normal format {{involves}} {{three men}} and three women, or four teams of two people with a pre-existing relationship, who have to complete three professional <b>stunts</b> to win US$50,000. If a contestant/team is too scared to attempt a <b>stunt,</b> failed to complete a <b>stunt,</b> or (in some cases) had the worst performance on a <b>stunt,</b> they are eliminated from the competition. If only one contestant/team successfully completes the first or the second <b>stunt,</b> they automatically win $25,000, and the other contestants eliminated in the <b>stunt</b> along with {{the winner of the}} <b>stunt</b> return for the next <b>stunt</b> to compete for the remaining $25,000. If no one successfully completed the first or the second <b>stunt,</b> then all of the contestants/teams eliminated in the <b>stunt</b> would return to the next <b>stunt</b> to compete for a reduced $25,000 (this rule did not apply for non-elimination <b>stunts).</b> The only exception to this was in season one, where if one person completed the <b>stunt,</b> then the completer won $10,000 and the $50,000 grand prize was not reduced.|$|R
5|$|In 1915, at {{the annual}} meeting of the American Association for the Study and Prevention of Infant Mortality, DeLee spoke out against the use of {{midwives}} for childbirth. DeLee said that midwives <b>stunted</b> the progress of the obsetrical profession and said that he refused to take part in the education of a provider that lowered the standards of the profession. If obstetrics were seen as dignified work that could draw more than the menial fees charged by midwives, DeLee said, many young physicians would be willing to deliver the patients that were then under the care of midwives.|$|E
5|$|In January 1886 David {{spent a week}} in Auckland {{hospital}} undergoing {{surgery to}} treat <b>stunted</b> muscles in his left leg which had led to curvature of his spine. His mother became sick that same year, and in 1887 lost her teaching position. His mother's condition worsened and she died of cancer on 9September 1887. With a father in his seventies, the 13-year-old David was compelled to leave school so he could help his brothers to support the family. He took {{a job with a}} local stock and station agent.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Chicago still {{preferred}} palazzo-styled {{buildings with}} large light {{courts in the}} centre, because they remained the most profitable designs. The Wrigley Building, built under the 1920 law, demonstrated the effect of two ornamental towers {{on top of a}} skyscraper. Under the revised law, the Straus Building and the Pittsfield Building took the palazzo design and added somewhat <b>stunted</b> towers on top in the early 1920s, producing profitable buildings.|$|E

50|$|The <b>stunts</b> {{were all}} similar to Beat the Clock <b>stunts,</b> {{but they were}} all {{designed}} to be messy. Sometimes Johnathan would perform another magic trick prior to the <b>stunt.</b> Many <b>stunts</b> often awarded around $500 to be split amongst the teams, and some <b>stunts</b> allowed for bonus money.|$|R
50|$|In <b>Stunts</b> mode, the player, {{in order}} to win, must {{accumulate}} the highest amount of points by performing successful <b>stunts.</b> To perform a <b>stunt,</b> a rider must gain enough height in mid-air and then is able to perform any of the six <b>stunts.</b> A failed <b>stunt</b> results from the rider crashing while attempting to perform a <b>stunt.</b> In <b>stunts,</b> there is no restriction as to where the player may go, and so he may also roam freely across the map.|$|R
5|$|Nearly {{two billion}} {{people in the}} {{developing}} world are deficient in zinc. In children, it causes an increase in infection and diarrhea and contributes to the death of about 800,000 children worldwide per year. The World Health Organization advocates zinc supplementation for severe malnutrition and diarrhea. Zinc supplements help prevent disease and reduce mortality, especially among children with low birth weight or <b>stunted</b> growth. However, zinc supplements should not be administered alone, because many {{in the developing world}} have several deficiencies, and zinc interacts with other micronutrients.|$|E
5|$|The alpine biome of {{the pass}} extends below it {{on either side}} to an {{elevation}} of approximately , or about the altitude of the Linkins Lake trailhead on the western side, Highway 82's uppermost crossing of the Roaring Fork. Below it is a subalpine zone where lodgepole pine, Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir and aspen dominate the forest. A few patches of those trees persist above that elevation, but they are mostly <b>stunted</b> krummholz.|$|E
5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid {{is a major}} pest of sugar beet, bean and celery crops {{with large numbers of}} aphids cause {{stunting}} of the plants. Beans suffer damage to flowers and pods which may not develop properly. Early-sown crops may avoid significant damage if they have already flowered before the number of aphids builds up in the spring. Celery can be heavily infested. The plants are <b>stunted</b> by the removal of sap, the stems are distorted, harmful viruses are transmitted, and aphid residues may contaminate the crop.|$|E

50|$|Muay Thai <b>Stunt</b> is a Thailand-based {{group of}} <b>stunt</b> doubles, formed by Panna Rittikrai to work {{alongside}} him on action films. Members of the <b>stunt</b> team are skilled in acrobatics and gymnastics, weapons-related fighting arts, Muay Thai and other martial arts including Wushu and Tae Kwon Do. The <b>stunt</b> team specializes in fight choreography, fall <b>stunts,</b> wire-work, vehicular <b>stunts</b> and explosion <b>stunts.</b> A trademark of Panna's films {{is the use}} of full contact rather than pulling punches or the use of camera tricks in the fight scenes.|$|R
50|$|Some {{actors are}} known to have {{performed}} their own <b>stunts.</b> Jackie Chan is particularly famous for doing most of his own <b>stunts,</b> as are fellow martial arts star and movie partners Yuen Biao and Sammo Hung. Indian actor Jayan was well known for performing extremely dangerous <b>stunts</b> by himself and was killed while performing a helicopter <b>stunt.</b> Akshay Kumar is also famous for doing all of his own <b>stunts</b> and has done several dangerous <b>stunts.</b> Thai martial artist and actor Tony Jaa performs his own <b>stunts,</b> likewise.|$|R
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are recorded}} as making 242 unprovoked attacks between 1948 and mid-2004, causing sixteen human fatalities. Ten {{of these were}} {{in the water and}} two were on land; the circumstances of the other four are not known. Most attacks were in the warmer months of the year, though in Florida, with its warmer climate, attacks can happen at any time of year. Alligators are considered to be less aggressive than either the Nile or saltwater crocodile, but the increase in density of the human population in the Everglades has brought people and alligators into closer proximity and increased the risk of alligator attacks. Conversely in Mauritania, where the crocodiles' growth is severely <b>stunted</b> by the arid conditions, the local people swim with them without being attacked.|$|E
5|$|At higher elevations, {{mountain}} hemlock and subalpine fir are {{the most}} common trees. Alaska cedar and whitebark pine are also present. However, as the elevation increases, the forest becomes increasingly fragmented, and is interspersed with meadows consisting of grasses, herbs, and shrubs. Scree slopes are also common. Temperatures can vary greatly within one day due to the high altitude of the habitat and lack of forest cover. For the same reasons, the parkland also experiences increased solar radiation. At the upper edge of the parkland, trees tend to be <b>stunted,</b> and grow in small clumps. Common shrubs include heather and mountain huckleberry. Off-trail hiking can be very destructive in the sub-alpine zone.|$|E
5|$|Gray {{published}} his findings in a 1906 {{volume of the}} Proceedings of the Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society, in which he drew comparisons between the site and two Cornish stone circles that he had recently surveyed, Fernacre and Stannon stone circle. He proffered {{the suggestion that the}} circle had been the site of cremations, with the cremated human remains then being buried within the nearby tumuli. In August 1909, Gray returned to the site {{for the first time in}} nine years. He noted that the circle was in largely the same condition as before, but that the ling and whortleberry bushes around the site were more <b>stunted</b> than they had previously been.|$|E
