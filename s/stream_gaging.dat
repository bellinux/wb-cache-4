40|$|Presented at The Oregon Water Conference, May 24 - 25, 2011, Corvallis, OR. Oregon’s <b>stream</b> <b>gaging</b> {{network was}} last {{evaluated}} in 1970 by the U. S. Geological Survey. Water management and scientific-related needs have changed significantly since 1970, including {{the recognition of}} instream water rights and implications of climate change on water resources. The Oregon Water Resources Department (OWRD) has recently undertaken {{an evaluation of the}} state’s <b>stream</b> <b>gaging</b> network in order to meet OWRD current and future data needs. The OWRD goals (or data needs) for the <b>stream</b> <b>gaging</b> network are broadly grouped into those associated with water management and those associated with scientific purposes. The water management goal for the gage network is to provide discharge data required for timely and effective distribution of water by the state, and to meet conjunctive use management needs. The scientific goals include providing discharge data for: 1) regional regression analysis; 2) defining hydrologic systems; 3) accurate forecasts; and 4) long term trend analysis. The management component of the gaging evaluation is complete and is under internal peer review. A qualitative approach was used in the evaluation after quantitative methods proved difficult due to variability in regulatory settings across Oregon. Over 1, 000 watersheds, storage facilities, diversions and stream reaches were examined in the management component of the gage network evaluation. The evaluation identified 225 locations needing stream gages to meet OWRD’s water management goal. Currently there are active gages at 155 of these locations, leaving 70 sites where new gages are needed for surface water management. Of these locations, 31 were designated as high priority sites due to their regulatory, environmental, and logistical setting. These locations were predominately located in the south central and south eastern part of the state. The <b>stream</b> <b>gaging</b> network is currently meeting today’s conjunctive–use management needs.

40|$|Presented at The Oregon Water Conference, May 24 - 25, 2011, Corvallis, OR. Peak {{discharge}} {{estimates are}} fundamental {{in the design}} of hydraulic structures, embankment protection, and stream restoration efforts, as well as flood risk analysis. Historic <b>stream</b> <b>gage</b> records are commonly used in the development of peak discharge estimates for a particular watershed. Use of an entire <b>stream</b> <b>gage</b> record assumes hydrologic stationarity within the basin of interest. However, changes in land use or climatic conditions may invalidate the assumption of hydrologic stationarity. An alternative to estimation from historic gage records is the development of peak discharges from a continuous hydrologic simulation and incorporating known or predicted changes to the hydrologic regime of the basin. This presentation addresses an application of long-term continuous hydrologic simulation using Hydrologic Engineering Center Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS). A long term simulation of Johnson Creek basin was developed using current land use conditions in order estimate peak discharges for the City of Gresham flood study. The calibrated HEC-HMS model used a precipitation record of 61 years. The HEC-HMS model setup, calibration and verification are described.

SST is an atmospheric circulation indicator which provides the predictive information about the hydrologic variability in the region around the world.

40|$|To {{estimate}} weekly stream temperatures throughout {{an annual}} cycle, a 4 - parameter, non-linear function of weekly air temperatures was used. Two {{parameters of the}} regression function represented the estimated minimum and maximum stream temperatures and the remaining two parameters described gradients and inflection points of the air temperature/stream temperature relationship. The model also included a seasonal heat storage effect (hysteresis). The regression function was applied to 585 gaging stations in the contiguous U. S. To represent air temperatures at any <b>stream</b> <b>gaging</b> station, the closest of 197 first order weather stations was used. The distance between a <b>stream</b> <b>gaging</b> station and the corresponding weather station ranged from 1. 4 km to 244 km, {{and did not have}} a significant effect on the goodness of fit. The model simulated weekly stream temperatures at 573 (98 %) gaging stations, with a coefficient of determination (Nash-Sutcliffe Coefficient) larger than 0. 7 and at 491 gaging stations (84 %) with a coefficient larger than 0. 9. At 11 gaging stations the coefficient of determination ranged from 0. 45 to 0. 7. There were also 57 gaging stations with estimated maximum stream temperatures smaller than at least four weekly recorded data for the period of study. Consequently, the model is deemed successfully applicable (with 99 % confidence) to more than 89 % of the <b>stream</b> <b>gaging</b> stations, and the average coefficient of determination of the stream temperature projection is 0. 93 ± 0. 01. The root mean squared error between· actual measurements and proj ections by the· regression equations is 1. 64 ± 0. 46 DC. To study the probability of absence or presence of warmwater fish in cold region streams (Scheller et al., 1997), the model is applicable to 98 % of streams. No significant correlation was evident between the mean annual air temperatures and the non-linear function parameters. There was a weak correlation between the latitude of the gaging stations and two parameters of the non-linear function. Further studies are required to find correlations between the regression model parameters and the geographical, hydrological or meteorological conditions by dividing the gaging stations in the database into free flowing rivers and regulated rivers.

40|$|To project fish habitat {{changes of}} 57 fish species under {{potential}} global warming, their suitable thermal habitat at 764 <b>stream</b> <b>gaging</b> {{stations in the}} contiguous US was studied. Water temperature records were available at these gaging stations. Global warming was specified by air temperature increases projected by the Canadian Center of Climate Modelling general circulation model for a. doubling of atmospheric C 02. The thermal regime at each gaging station' was related to air temperature using a nonlinear stream temperature/air temperature relationship. ' Suitable fish thermal habitat {{was assumed to be}} constrained by both maximum temperature and minimum temperature tolerances. Streams with weekly water temperatures between the maximum and minimum temperature tolerances of a fish species were considered to provide suitable thermal habitat for that fish species: Because information on minimum temperature tolerance of many fish species could not be found, both a 0 °C and a 2 °C lower temperature constraint were' applied. There is a 38 % difference in the number of <b>stream</b> <b>gaging</b> stations, with suitable thermal habitat for warmwater fishes, when 0 °C or 2 ° C is used as the lower temperature constraint. The total number of stations with suitable thermal habitat for warmwat~r fishes is projected not to decrease under 2 XC 02 climate conditions, regardless of whether a 0 °C or a 2 °C lower temperature constraint is applied but a· northward spread of warmwater fishes under 2 XC 02 climate conditions is projected. For cold-water and cool-water fishes, the number of stations with suitable thermal habitat under a 2 xC 02 climate scenario is projected to decrease by 36 % and 15 %, respectively, with 0 °C as the lower temperature constraint. With a 2 °C lower temperature constraint,. more suitable habitat for cool-water fishes and little change for cold-water fishes is projected. It is therefore concluded that the values of the lower temperature constraint, in addition to the upper temperature consp-aint, have a large influence on thermal habitat projections.
