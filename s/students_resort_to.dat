In the first place, we identified, classified, and counted the number and kind of reiteration ties used by two groups of EFL learners. Secondly, we examined whether reiteration as a mechanism of lexical cohesion correlates with learners ’ language level. Thirdly, we looked at students data in order to determine if lexical reiteration is associated with lexical variation. Results point to a similar pattern for both groups with regard to the use of reiteration ties: content and non-content <b>students</b> <b>resort</b> <b>to</b> word repetition rather than to other devices of lexical reiteration.

40|$|One of the {{difficult}} and frustrating aspects of teaching mathematics is getting students to think logically and develop an ability to prove theorems. Too frequently, <b>students</b> <b>resort</b> <b>to</b> {{what might be called}} "proof by example. " A classic illustration of "proof by example" comes from years of teaching "mathematics for economists.

" Too frequently the student "proof" begins with: "Let A = 1, 3, 5, 7 and B = 2, 4, 6, 8. Then [...] . " Other examples, in other areas of mathematics, no doubt abound. This note presents an obviously preposterous "theorem" and "proves" it with many examples. This "theorem," once "proved" in class, successfully discourages future proofs "by example. "...|$|E

A total of 16 classroom mathematics lessons from primary schools in the Kelantan State of Malaysia were observed and recorded. Within the four schools, two were SK (national schools) and two were SJKC (Chinese primary schools). A rural school and an urban school constituted the two schools of the same type. The researcher observed four classes from two levels for each participating school, i. e., two Standard 2 classes from the lower primary level and two Standard 5 classes from the upper primary level. The two classes of each level were in fact comprised of a good class and a weak class. The use of languages in resorting to code-switching was examined across various factors, such as types of schools, school location, class levels, and types of classes. The notion of C-unit (communicative unit) proposed by Loban (1976) was used to analyze the types of languages use as well as their proportion of use.

The analysis examines possible reasons why {{a number of}} female <b>students</b> <b>resort</b> <b>to</b> writing graffiti. It highlights the ways through which the acquisition of sexual knowledge occurs informally outside the formal curriculum, through spaces created and struggled over by the informants. The study interrogates the emotional, social, cultural, personal and political worlds as described by them. This includes a discourse analysis, aimed at providing a deeper understanding of ignored emotional and social perspectives. In the absence of sexuality and relationships education in postsecondary education curricula in Malta, this study challenges silences surrounding these matters. The study documents the graffiti as subversive processes of learning, which reproduce and resist dominant discourses. It regards the graffiti as constituting a discourse in itself, understood as possibly promoting agency in some of the informants' lives. A reflexive approach was adopted to arrive at the research aims. Poststructuralist feminist and queer theory perspectives locate the study's theoretical positionings. Ethnographic observations and informal conversations with nineteen female students were employed to assist the data analysis. The findings show that some informants question the ways they relate to their gender identity when confronted by hetero, lesbian and bisexual social relationships. Heteronormative dominance and familiarity are actively reproduced, contested, disturbed and resisted. The findings suggest that the informants seek a safe school environment, where they can discuss sexualities and relationships' matters in a context of empathy, caring, understanding and support.

Teachers of more than ten years of teaching experience, however, looked beyond individual students and see the problem as societal.

When the student’s teacher pushed for a correct answer instead of pursuing the student’s attempts at understanding the mechanism, the <b>student</b> <b>resorted</b> <b>to</b> using textbook terms that she did not fully understand. Consequently, Russ recommended that mechanisms be considered when assessing students’ scientific understanding. Indeed, in many natural sciences, explanations must include an explanation of mechanisms to be satisfactory (Machamer, Darden, & Craver, 2000), and others have advocated for mechanistic understanding within the social sciences as well (see Hedström & Ylikoski, 2010 for a review). Our findings suggest that mechanistic knowledge may be equally useful in mathematics. Providing people with information on the context’s mechanisms may push them toward mathematical problem-solving strategies.|$|R

The primary objective {{of this study was to}} identify and explore the factors influencing postgraduate full-time working students wellness by focusing on how the situation of working and studying simultaneously impacts the three aspects of wellness, namely: physical, mental and social wellness. The researcher embarked on this study from an interpretivist stance in terms of which a qualitative research strategy was employed in order to explore the experiences of postgraduate full-time working students and gain an understanding of the factors influencing their physical, mental and social wellness. A purposive sampling strategy was utilised in order to determine the nineteen postgraduate full-time working students, who constituted the sample for this research study. The data was obtained through semi-structured interviews, essays, as well as drawings and was analysed using thematic analysis. The results of the study revealed that various factors impacted the wellness of the participants of the study. Significant factors such as a balanced lifestyle, time and task management, the nature of the job and studies, coping mechanisms, overarching emotions, mental capacity and effective functioning, attitude and motivation, as well as a support structure were identified in this study. Many of the factors were within the three domains of wellness, thus demonstrating significant links among physical, mental and social wellness. The participants also highlighted the lessons learnt from and the benefits of concurrently working and studying. Along with this, the participants indicated a need for an effective support system, more awareness concerning wellness management and the nature of the masters course, as well as clarifying expectations from the University.

The research discusse d here is an attempt to investigate the patterns of Physics problem-solving among Key Stage 4 (14 - 16 years old) students in Cambridge through the lens of metacognition using Grounded Theory. In order to match the students with “real” problems (i. e. that are difficult for them but solvable), 148 students from 5 schools were given a Physics Problems Test (PhyPT) consists of 6 - 8 Physics “problems” and followed by 2 questions to measur e the level of difficulty of each problem. Later, 22 students were selected as theoretical sample (at different stages of the research) to undergo a session of individual problem-solving using thinking-aloud and observation by the researcher, followed by retrospective semi-structured interviews. In order to reach the theoretical saturation point, a few more problems were constructed to match the level of difficulty and concep tual understanding of thes e selected students. The thinking-aloud was being recorded, transcribed and coded using the constant comparative method of Grounded Theory. The analysis of the thinking-aloud protocols was supported by the analyses of data from the interviews, observations using video and analysis of answer sheets. The data analyses further suggested a few hypotheses to look in detail in order to generate more concrete pattern of Physics problem-solving. The repetition of the research in different format of prob lems and cycles of data collection- analysis produced two problem-solving patterns among the students. The saturated patterns suggest that students show different approaches when facing easy questions and difficult problems. The easy-question pattern is quite consistent and “expert-like” while more metacognitive skills are shown in the difficult-problem patte rns. <b>Students</b> <b>resort</b> <b>to</b> means-end, trial-and-error and guessing strategies when facing with difficult problems.

40|$|At the University of Salford it is a {{struggle}} to find sufficient timetable space to deliver in-depth legal research training to new first year students. The training delivered often alienated students due to the information overload they experienced. Timetable pressures resulted in sessions being librarian led with little interaction with students. This left students feeling overwhelmed, often nervous of using the library and performing research. As a result law <b>students</b> <b>resorted</b> <b>to</b> using Google as their academic research tool of choice. To combat these problems, the Law Librarian implemented the innovative training concept of ‘flipping the classroom’. Rather than using teaching time to instruct students ‘how to’ perform research by demonstrating resources and concepts, the classroom was flipped so students studied online content before entering the classroom. Face to face teaching time was then spent actively learning through practical tasks and discussion to consolidate student learning. Students took {{responsibility for their own}} learning and teaching sessions were based on group work and discussion, facilitated by the librarian rather than librarian-led. This article is based on the presentation, ‘Flipping Training’ delivered at the BIALL Conference 2013. It will look at how the ‘flipping the classroom’ concept works and how it has been implemented at the University of Salford. It will examine the benefits and drawbacks of flipping training as well as ideas for implementing flipped training within other organisations...|$|R

The four texts (a road sign and three advertisements) were translated in two separate sessions by twenty-eight students pursuing a B. A. in English language and literature. In the first session, the students were provided with the texts decontextualized: while in the second they were provided with the same texts in the contexts they usually occur in. In the two sessions {{the students were asked}} to explain in a separate sheet why thev translated each text in the way they did. Two notions, closely related to the translating process, are discussed in the analysis of the translation provided. These notions are "reference" and "representation". The analysis has shown that the <b>student</b> translators <b>resorted</b> <b>to</b> referential strategies in the process of translating when they were aware of the relevant contextual dimensions of the target text. Their translations in this case retained the registral, rhetorical, and formal characteristics of the types of texts they translated. The analysis has also shown that when unaware of the pertinent contextual dimensions of the text, the <b>student</b> translators <b>resorted</b> <b>to</b> representational (introspective) strategies whereby contexts and world realities deriving from experiences and worlds other than those intended by the SL text producer were created, and the translations bore rhetorical, registral, and syntactic features relevant to the contexts and world realities the translators created.

40|$|International audienceOrganic {{chemistry}} is often {{considered to be}} a difficult subject to teach and to learn, particularly as <b>students</b> prefer <b>to</b> <b>resort</b> <b>to</b> memorization alone rather than reasoning using models from chemical reactivity. Existing studies have led us to suggest principles for redefining the curriculum, ranging from its overall structure to the tasks given to the students. We suggest reorganizing the content around the organic chemist's questions and even in the first year implementing teaching based on modeling, organic synthesis, and using a database (the "reaction library") in class. Finally, we present a full curriculum reconciling these principles with the current content of an organic chemistry course.
