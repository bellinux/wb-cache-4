2500|$|The {{biggest change}} for the Torino was the switch to body-on-frame {{construction}} from the unit-construction of the 1971 models. The new chassis was a perimeter design {{that was used to}} help give the Torino a quieter and more isolated ride. It featured an energy absorbing [...] "S" [...] shaped front end, torque boxes to isolate road shock, fourteen rubber body mounts and five solid cross members. The front suspension used an unequal length control arm design, with a computer selected coil spring mounted on the strut stabilized lower control arm, much like the fullsize Ford LTD. The rear used the [...] "Stabul" [...] four link suspension with a computer selected coil spring mounted on a solid axle. The new suspension and chassis had a wheel track at least [...] wider than the 1971 models. [...] Motor Trend stated the [...] "road isolation and vibrational dampening is superb" [...] in its test of a 1972 Gran Torino Brougham 4-door. Ford offered two suspension options, the heavy-duty and competition suspension. The heavy-duty suspension included a larger front <b>sway</b> <b>bar,</b> and heavy-duty springs and shocks. [...] Competition suspension, only available in two-door models, included the most heavy-duty springs and shocks, heavy duty rear upper control arms and bushings, a larger front <b>sway</b> <b>bar,</b> and the addition of a rear <b>sway</b> <b>bar.</b> This was the first year that a rear <b>sway</b> <b>bar</b> was offered in the Torino and was only available with competition and police suspension options. Front disc brakes became standard on all Torinos, which no other American intermediate (other than its sister car the Mercury Montego) offered in 1972, however, power brakes remained an option. [...] The only exceptions were that power brakes were standard on the Gran Torino Squire station wagons and a mandatory option for all [...] powered models. The power steering was revised to be integral in the steering box, rather than the external booster style used in previous years. All Torinos used 14-inch wheels, while 15-inch wheels were used for exclusively by police and taxi models.|$|E

Gran Torino 2-doors now were available with [...] "opera windows", a popular option during the mid-1970s, while Brougham models had these {{as a standard}} feature. All 2-door Torinos had fixed rear windows unlike the 1972–73 models. The Torino was becoming more luxury oriented and new luxury features were available. These included a leather-wrapped steering wheel, split bench seat, an electric sunroof, and speed control with steering wheel controls. Gran Torino hardtops and sedans had a new rear fender skirt option, to give the Torino a longer, lower look. The trim was revised on 1974 models; moldings now ran on the rocker panels instead of the lower doors. Brougham and Sport models had an extra chrome molding that ran on the lower fender edge between the front wheelwell and bumper; this gave the appearance of bumper-to-bumper chrome. Squires had no lower body moldings. All 1974 Torinos featured the seat belt-interlock system, as mandated by the U.S. government. This short-lived safety system would be removed after the 1974 model year. The competition suspension was no longer offered, and the only suspension option was a revised heavy-duty suspension package. This option was available on all Torinos except the Elite, and included a larger front <b>sway</b> <b>bar</b> and heavy-duty front and rear springs. Heavy-duty shocks and a rear <b>sway</b> <b>bar</b> were included in this package on 2-door and 4-door sedan models only; station wagons did not include these features.|$|E

The other changes were minor (e.g. a slight modification to the extruded aluminum grille, a front <b>sway</b> <b>bar</b> made standard on six-cylinder models, and an optional black vinyl roof cover that continued over the trunk opening). New was an electronic tach {{on the top of the}} dash.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, Aaron Pfadt and Johnny O'Connell {{launched}} a new Corvette suspension line carrying O'Connell's signature and design input. This long term partnership continues today. As a GM Factory driver, O'Connell has an impressive winning record including four wins at LaMans, and as {{the driver of the}} championship Cadillac ATS., Engineered and built by Pfadt, the parts were tested and approved by O'Connell through rigorous track testing and street driving. As an aftermarket upgrade appropriate for both street and track use, the original package included <b>sway</b> <b>bars</b> and shock absorbers.
