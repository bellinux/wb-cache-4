5|$|The NTSB {{investigation}} found {{that after a}} June 17 replacement of a track circuit component at what became {{the site of the}} June 22 collision, the track circuit had been suffering from parasitic oscillations which left it unable to reliably report when that stretch of track was occupied by a train. The struck train came to a <b>stop</b> because <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> ahead. Because the entire train was within the faulty circuit, it became invisible to the Automatic Train Control (ATC) system. The train behind it was therefore commanded to proceed at 55mph. The operator of the striking train applied the emergency brake after the stopped train came into full view but there was not enough time to prevent the collision, which occurred at approximately 44mph.|$|R
30|$|The {{assignment}} (explicit or implicit) of {{weights to}} performance MOEs for each attribute {{is one of}} the key steps and should be approached carefully, because weights may bias the selection of alternatives. Performance attributes have one or several MOEs; e.g., traffic delay, queue length and number <b>of</b> <b>stops</b> are MOEs <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> operation performance. The MOEs selected for one performance attribute should be independent of each other. If multiple MOEs are defined for one attribute, then an expert panel or Delphi technique [18] is recommended to establish relative weights for them. Most large urban areas have sufficient local reservoirs of relevant expertise. In the case <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> projects, experts may be selected form the city and state department of transportation (DOT), the metropolitan planning organization (MPO), and local engineering chapters and universities.|$|R
50|$|The {{issue of}} {{pedestrian}} safety was highlighted {{soon after the}} terminal opened. While a crosswalk was just a short distance south of the station, many would cross Peel Centre Drive (running east-west) or Team Canada Drive (north-south) at random places {{along the edge of}} the station lot. In May 2011, city council approved the creation of a scramble intersection crossing, which would <b>stop</b> both directions <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> while pedestrians can cross one road, or cross both by heading diagonally. Resident George Startup lobbied the city on the issue, which Brampton Safe City supported. Electrical issues delayed the installation <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> lights at the intersection of Peel Centre Drive and Team Canada Drive, further adding to the issue.|$|R
5000|$|A {{crossing}} guard (North America and India), {{a school}} crossing patrol officer (United Kingdom), school crossing supervisor and sometimes guard (Australia) or school road patrol and guard (New Zealand) is a traffic management volunteer who is normally stationed on busy roadways to aid pedestrians. Often associated with elementary school children, crossing guards <b>stop</b> the flow <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> so pedestrians may cross an intersection. Crossing guards are known {{by a variety of}} names, the most widely used in the United Kingdom and Australia being [...] "lollipop lady/man", a reference to the large signs used that resemble lollipops.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Stop</b> Sex <b>Trafficking</b> <b>of</b> Children and Young People campaign, {{launched}} by ECPAT International and The Body Shop (2009-2012), engaged {{the public as}} advocates and called on governments to safeguard the rights {{of children and adolescents}} to protect them from sex trafficking. During the three-year campaign 7,044,278 petition signatures were collected worldwide. The petitions were presented to government officials around the world and to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in September 2012.|$|R

50|$|The {{industries}} that made Albion prosperous started to decline after that decade. The canal was enlarged and made {{part of the}} New York State Barge Canal system in 1918, which failed to <b>stop</b> the loss <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> to railroads that were growing ever more efficient. By the 1920s Portland cement had become common and cheap enough that the sandstone quarries were losing customers. The courthouse was renovated in the late 1920s. Late in the Depression, in 1937, a new post office in the Colonial Revival style was built opposite the courthouse and library, with two Greek Revival homes that had been there demolished in the process.|$|R

50|$|The Clapham Sect, a {{group of}} Victorian Evangelical politicians, campaigned {{during most of the}} 19th century for England to use its {{influence}} and power to <b>stop</b> the <b>traffic</b> <b>of</b> slaves to Brazil. Besides moral qualms, Brazilian slavery hampered the development of markets for British products, which was a main concern of British government and civil society. This combination led to intensive pressure from the British government for Brazil to end this practice, which it did by steps over several decades. Slavery was legally ended May 13 by the Lei Áurea ("Golden Law") of 1888.|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom {{there is}} no direct offense {{committed}} if a pedestrian fails to obey crossing signals and many lights commonly only use two still images - a green walking person and a red standing man, this being the general case where the crossing is at a road junction and the pedestrian signals are in combination with those controlling vehicular traffic. Flashing amber lights and images at pedestrian crossings are used where the vehicular traffic lights perform the sole function <b>of</b> <b>stopping</b> road <b>traffic</b> to allow pedestrians to cross a road.|$|R
50|$|The current bridge {{opened on}} January 24, 2009, about seven months ahead of schedule, {{according}} to the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT). Construction on the new span, estimated to cost $33.6 million, began in 2007. The new bridge crosses slightly west of the previous span. The fixed-span bridge rises 52 feet above the water and alleviates the necessity <b>of</b> <b>stopping</b> highway <b>traffic</b> to open the movable span on the former bridge, {{as well as being}} more convenient for the recreational boaters who can now pass freely upriver to a point near Walker's Dam.|$|R
40|$|Intersections {{are common}} sources of {{recurring}} congestion, {{as well as}} crashes that cause additional congestion. Intersections in the United States are traditionally controlled by traffic signals or stop signs; these traffic control devices are inherent sources of delay {{by their very nature}} <b>of</b> <b>stopping</b> one direction <b>of</b> <b>traffic</b> to permit a conflicting movement to proceed. The modern roundabout design counteracts those sources of delay; it is an intersection design that has been long established in other countries and is being increasingly utilized in the United States. A roundabout is a type of circular intersection with yield control for entering traffic, splitter islands on the approaches, and appropriate roadway curvature to reduce vehicle speeds on each approach. 1 All vehicles enter at lower speeds and traverse the roundabout, but it is not necessary for any vehicle to stop unless waiting on a gap in traffic on the circulating roadway...|$|R

50|$|The Clapham Sect, a {{group of}} evangelical reformers, campaigned {{during much of the}} 19th century for Britain to use its {{influence}} and power to <b>stop</b> the <b>traffic</b> <b>of</b> slaves to Brazil. Besides moral qualms, the low cost of slave-produced Brazilian sugar meant that British colonies in the West Indies were unable to match the market prices of Brazilian sugar, and each Briton was consuming 16 pounds (7 kg) of sugar a year by the 19th century. This combination led to intensive pressure from the British government for Brazil to end this practice, which it did by steps over several decades.|$|R
50|$|Ramp {{meters in}} Mississauga, Ontario are {{designed}} {{in such a}} way so that if the queue waiting to enter the QEW grows {{to the point where it}} may back up onto city streets, the meter is lifted and all traffic entering the highway is able to move freely without waiting for the meter. The meter goes back into service once the ramp queue is reduced to a reasonable level. While this method may increase congestion on the highway itself, it has the benefit of keeping city arterials free <b>of</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>traffic</b> waiting in queue. Ramp queues are usually quite short, lasting only 5-6 seconds on average before the driver may continue to the freeway.|$|R
50|$|The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) is {{a global}} effort that aims to <b>stop</b> <b>trafficking</b> <b>of</b> weapons of mass {{destruction}} (WMD), their delivery systems, and related materials to and from states and non-state actors of proliferation concern.
