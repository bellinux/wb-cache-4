25|$|In May 1999, Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, {{and other}} activists protested the December 1998 fatal police {{shooting}} of Tyisha Miller in central Riverside, California. Miller, a 19-year-old African-American woman, had sat unconscious {{in a locked}} car with a flat tire and the engine left running, parked at a local gas station. After her relatives had called 9-1-1, Riverside Police Department officers {{who responded to the}} scene observed a gun in the young woman's lap, and according to their accounts, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> and foaming at the mouth, and in need of medical attention. When officers decided to break her window to reach her, as one officer reached for the weapon, she allegedly awoke and clutched her firearm, prompting several officers to open fire, hitting her 23 times and killing her. When the Riverside County district attorney stated that the officers involved had erred in judgement but committed no crime, declining to file criminal charges against them, Sharpton participated in protests which reached their zenith when protestors spilled onto the busy SR 91, completely stopping traffic. Sharpton was arrested for his participation and leadership in these protests.|$|E
2500|$|On November 7, 2011, Michael Jackson's family {{arrived at}} the {{courthouse}} in Los Angeles shortly after the jury announced they reached their verdict; they had found Murray guilty. Michael's father Joe Jackson simply told reporters [...] "Justice." [...] LaToya Jackson tweeted that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> uncontrollably {{when she heard the}} verdict, and continued to tweet her emotions throughout the day. In 2017, Paris Jackson stated that she was [...] "absolutely" [...] convinced that her father had been murdered.|$|E
6000|$|As {{the woman}} winced and {{everyone}} else wondered, he went on: [...] "I am somewhat used to Miss Armstrong's tremors. I have seen her trembling {{off and on for}} years. And some said <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> with cold and some <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> with fear, but I know <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> with hate and wicked anger--fiends that have had their feast this morning. She would have been away by now with her lover and all the money but for me. Ever since my poor old master prevented her from marrying that tipsy blackguard--" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaken</b> by this, and I {{hastened to}} {{complete}} my victory by other methods.|$|R
60|$|It {{is not to}} <b>be</b> {{denied that}} <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>shaking</b> Amy when the Colonel once more intrudes.|$|R
60|$|Again <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaken</b> with laughter, and {{suddenly}} {{to my surprise}} she turned and looked full at me.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> all over. He {{passed his}} other {{arm around her}} and lifted her up.|$|E
60|$|He {{went off}} and Barbara clung to her mother. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> and her breath came hard.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> {{with dry}} sobs. She felt the old woman's eyes upon her, {{but she could}} not stop.|$|E
60|$|To his horror <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaken</b> with sobs. He {{would have}} consoled her, but she motioned him away.|$|R
60|$|Elizabeth was {{bending over}} her dog, but even Tavernake, unobservant though he was, {{could see that}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaken.</b>|$|R
60|$|As {{he moved}} away Una reveled in having refused his half-hearted invitation, but already <b>she</b> <b>was</b> aware that <b>she</b> would regret it. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaken</b> with woman's {{fiercely}} possessive clinging to love.|$|R
6000|$|Bending her head, and {{scarcely}} able {{to steady}} herself, for <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> {{from head to}} foot, Aurelia managed to utter the query, ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> {{as if in}} a passion. His eyes {{expressed}} nothing; he only unlatched {{the gate}} in silence, grasped her arm and drew her in. Then closing it with a kick-- ...|$|E
60|$|He {{stopped short}} <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> her head slowly. The old despondency {{was back in}} her face. Her eyes were full of trouble. She laid her delicately gloved fingers upon his arm.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> {{looking at}} him very fixedly. Her lips were a little parted, her eyes were moist, her bosom was rising and falling as though <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>shaken</b> by some {{wonderful}} emotion.|$|R
60|$|Jill <b>was</b> shaken; but <b>she</b> had the {{fighting}} spirit and hated {{to show that}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaken.</b> Panic <b>was</b> {{knocking at the door}} of her soul, but dignity refused to be dislodged.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaken</b> by {{a furious}} hate for that shade that pursued {{her in this}} world, unappeased even by death in its longing for an heir {{that would be like}} other people's children.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the shadows}} that were round them, Alban {{could just see}} that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> her {{clinched}} fists in the air. He made another attempt to control her. [...] "Don't excite yourself! If she comes into the garden, she might hear you." ...|$|E
60|$|The tall, gaunt form of Ramona drew {{itself up}} out of the weeds and {{cautiously}} approached me. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> with nervous excitement, and had not ventured to come near without speaking for fear of being mistaken for an enemy and fired at.|$|E
60|$|The woman talked fast, {{but even}} in that dim light Mr. Sabin knew quite well that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> with fear. He could see {{the corners of her}} mouth twitch. Her black eyes rolled incessantly, but refused to meet his. Mr. Sabin frowned.|$|E
6000|$|... "He made a mistake," [...] she said, in a quick, tremulous tone, {{showing how}} much <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaken.</b> [...] "He thinks me a quack doctor's widow, whose secret is matter of bargain and sale." ...|$|R
5000|$|Willy DeVille {{said about}} the song [...] "Mixed Up, Shook Up Girl": [...] "I know Mick Jagger likes it. It's about a woman I know who <b>was</b> drug addict. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> mixed up and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>shook</b> up. That's what it's about." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{point did}} not seem of the least {{importance}} to her, but <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaken,</b> and felt that the silence which was growing significant would be insupportable. Then a thought struck her, and she looked up suddenly at the man.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> with anger, but the hand, after hesitating {{a moment}} longer, descended reluctantly to the sheath. As if fearing {{she could not}} {{restrain}} herself, she crossed to the fire and threw on more wood. McCan sat up, whimpering and snarling, between fright and rage spluttering an inarticulate explanation.|$|E
60|$|All {{that had}} {{happened}} came back to her, and she burst into tears. Her self-control deserted her, and, clinging to him for protection, she sobbed as though her heart would break. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> from head to foot. The strangeness of this last horror had overcome her, and she could have shrieked with fright.|$|E
6000|$|Ah, {{they had}} already done that, she knew, {{as much as she}} ever would; and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> her head at her pale sister the next moment with a world, on her side, of slowness. [...] "I wish I could see the resemblance. Of course her complexion's green," [...] she laughed; [...] "but mine's several shades greener." ...|$|E
5000|$|During sports meet, David {{approaches}} Ann {{and shows}} the photograph and threaten {{her to get}} dismissed. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>shaken</b> and while preparing for the jump she collapses. Girish knowing this musters the courage to challenge David and beats him black and blue.|$|R
50|$|Mrs Oliver seeks Hercule Poirot's help. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>shaken</b> by this death. She relates Joyce's claim, and now {{wonders if}} Joyce {{might have been}} telling the truth, which would provide someone with a motive for murdering her. Poirot investigates. He finds no one who admits to believing Joyce's story. Her older sister Ann and younger brother Leopold {{consider}} that Joyce told stories to gain attention.|$|R
6000|$|She {{shook her}} head as though <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>shaking</b> off water, and hastened into the library, a young, light, amiable presence, modest in unbuttoned fur coat, blue suit, fresh organdy collar, and tan boots {{roughened}} from scuffling snow. Miss Villets stared at her, and Carol purred, [...] "I was so sorry not to {{see you at the}} Thanatopsis yesterday. Vida said you might come." ...|$|R
60|$|But Lucilla, to {{the alarm}} of all, {{was already on}} her feet, skipped like a chamois to the steps, and flew dancing up the sward. Ere Owen and Robert had helped the other two ladies to land in a more {{rational}} manner, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> her mischievous head at a window, and thrusting in her sceptral reed-mace.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] he said, [...] "oh, {{this is a}} surprise!" [...] And fumbling at his straw hat, {{he passed}} his other hand over his sleeve {{and held it out}} to Gyp. It felt almost dry, and fatter than it had been. While <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> it, the dog moved forward and sat down on her feet. Mrs. Wagge also {{extended}} her hand, clad in a shiny glove.|$|E
60|$|Traces of {{deep-seated}} anguish {{appeared in}} my countenance. That she should hope I would go, {{that she should}} think it possible I could go, was insupportable. I depreciated Paris; I depreciated France. I said I wouldn't leave England, under existing circumstances, for any earthly consideration. Nothing should induce me. In short, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> the curls again, when the little dog came running along the walk to our relief.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaken</b> to {{the verge}} of yielding. The man was handsome, cultivated, distinguished, she thought. Whether she {{actually}} loved him, she did not know, but he could gratify her ambitions and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> strongly drawn to him. He {{had given her a}} lead, an opening for a few telling words that might go far toward the accomplishment of her wishes; but, tempted as <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> <b>she</b> would not utter them. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> loyal to the headstrong lad; Jim stood first with her.|$|R
60|$|Her manner {{was quite}} normal again, {{and no one}} could have told that so shortly before <b>she</b> had <b>been</b> <b>shaken</b> by such a great emotion.|$|R
60|$|Jocelyn Pierston hurried after; and, discerning his movement, Avice stood still. When he came up, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> slily <b>shaking</b> with {{restrained}} laughter.|$|R
