500|$|In March 2014, Brian Tyler {{signed on}} to compose the film's score, {{replacing}} the composer for the first film, Alan Silvestri, while also marking his third film collaboration with Marvel following Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World in 2013. Tyler stated that the score pays homage to John Williams' scores for Star Wars, Superman, and Raiders of the Lost Ark and references the scores for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films {{in order to create}} a similar musical universe, saying, [...] "That's the goal for <b>sure.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> to build in nostalgia and do it upfront so you can relate to it." [...] Danny Elfman also contributed music to the score, using Silvestri's theme from the first film to create a new hybrid theme. Hollywood Records released the album digitally on April 28, 2015, and in physical formats on May 19.|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} J. H. Wyman later indicated how [...] "White Tulip" [...] {{helped with}} {{the evolution of the}} show in an interview: [...] "It's very important to constantly try to attract more viewers and to try and not make the show alienating... Our solution {{came in the form of}} ‘White Tulip' and episodes like that, because we realized what we need to do to satiate both our hardcore fans and our financial responsibility is to create a term that we coined a 'mythalone.' It sounds really simple when you say it now, like, ‘Yes, <b>sure,</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a great standalone case, plus you thread in some great mythology.' But I've got to tell you it took us a long time to get there and realize it. Now we have that our template for telling stories that we think satisfies both parties". He and Pinkner later listed [...] "White Tulip" [...] as one of their favorite episodes.|$|E

"You said on that occasion," [...] {{continued}} Furnival, [...] "that <b>you</b> were <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> witnessed three {{signatures of}} Sir Joseph's that summer,--that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> probably witnessed three in July, that <b>you</b> were quite <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> witnessed three {{in one week}} in July, that <b>you</b> were nearly <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> witnessed three in one day, {{that you could not}} tell what day that might have been, and that <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been used as a witness so often that you really did not remember anything about it.

2500|$|As of the Rogers-produced Hockey Night, Coach's Corner was noticeably shortened, from {{as long as}} 10 {{minutes to}} as short as 5—a change that was lampshaded by both Cherry and MacLean during their first segment of the new season. The {{following}} Monday, Scott Moore had a short discussion with Cherry regarding the matter, laughing it off and explaining that [...] "if you have more to talk about, {{all you need to}} do is make sure you tell the executive producer what you want to talk about and we'll make <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> lots of time." ...|$|E
2500|$|His use of {{real-time}} rendered cinematics (not prerendered video) {{serves both}} his own rapidly interactive development process with no rendering delays, and the player's {{interaction with the}} game's continuity. He prefers to change his games right until they are finalized, and to make [...] "something unique and unprecedented". He prefers the game to be interactively fun rather than have elaborate film sequences, stating in 1999, [...] "I will never make movie-like games"; therefore, the more than 90 total minutes of short cutscenes interspersed throughout Ocarina of Time deliver more interactive cinematic qualities. His vision mandates a rapid and malleable development process with small teams, as when he directed substantial changes to the overall game scenario in the final months {{of the development of}} Ocarina of Time. He said, [...] "The reason behind using such a simple process, as I am <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> all experienced in the workshop, {{is that there is a}} total limit on team energy. There is a limit to the work a team can do, and there is a limit to my own energy. We opted not to use that limited time and energy on pre-rendered images for use in cinema scenes, but rather on tests on other inter-active elements and polishing up the game".|$|E
2500|$|Megan Lehmann, {{writing in}} The Hollywood Reporter, {{said that the}} film [...] "defies {{all but the most}} cynical not to get carried away by the force of its grandiose imagery and storytelling", and it is [...] "much less earnest than the trailer suggests, layered with a thin veneer of camp and a nod and a wink to {{accompany}} the requisite Aussie clichés", {{and the bottom line is}} [...] "In epic style, Baz Luhrmann weaves his wizardry on Oz". Roger Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4, noting [...] "Baz Luhrmann dreamed of making the Australian Gone with the Wind, and so he has, with much of that film's lush epic beauty and some of the same awkwardness with a national legacy of racism". David Ansen, in his review for Newsweek, wrote, [...] "Kidman seems to blossom under Luhrmann's direction: she's funny, warm and charming, and the erotic charge between her and the gruff, hunky Jackman is delicious. In a solemn season, Australias bold, kitschy, unapologetic artifice is a welcome respite". In her review for the New York Times, Manohla Dargis wrote, [...] "this creation story about modern Australia is a testament to movie love at its most devout, cinematic spectacle at its most extreme, and kitsch as an act of aesthetic communion". Andrew Sarris, in his review for the New York Observer, wrote, [...] "Australia is clearly a labor of love, and a matter of national pride. It is also a bit of a mess. I must confess that I might have been harder on Mr Luhrmann's film if I had not remained entranced by Ms Kidman ever since I first saw her in Phillip Noyce's Dead Calm in 1989; in my opinion, she has lost none of her luster in the 20 years since". In his review for Time, Richard Schickel wrote, [...] "Have you seen everything Australia has on offer a dozen times before? <b>Sure</b> <b>you</b> <b>have.</b> It's a movie less created by director and co-writer Baz Luhrmann than assembled, Dr Frankenstein-style, from the leftover body parts of earlier movies. Which leaves us asking this question: How come it is so damnably entertaining?" [...] Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal, opines that, [...] "in its heart of hearts Australia is an old-fashioned Western - a Northern, if you will - and all the more enjoyable for it." [...] Nick Rogers, of FilmYap, adds that, [...] "Luhrmann mythologized his homeland as American directors like John Ford did with Westerns — dramatic-license exaggerations that pay off in droves." [...] Ann Hornaday, in her review for the Washington Post, wrote, [...] "A wildly ambitious, luridly indulgent spectacle of romance, action, melodrama and revisionism, Australia is windy, overblown, utterly preposterous and insanely entertaining". In her review for Salon.com, Stephanie Zacharek wrote, [...] "The second half of Australia, Luhrmann's attempt to pull off a wartime weeper, is so aggressively sentimental that it begins to feel more like punishment than pleasure. I left Australia feeling drained and weakened, as if I'd suffered a gradual poisoning at the hands of a mad scientist".|$|E
