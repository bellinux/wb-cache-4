25|$|KfW {{is engaged}} in Nablus, Tulkarem, Salfit, Ramallah / Al-Bireh, Jenin and Gaza City. The water supply {{activities}} focus on the reduction of non-revenue water so that the available water resources can be used more efficiently. One successful example of water loss reduction is {{the first phase of}} the KfW-supported program in Nablus: the frequency of supply for 8,000 inhabitants in the Rafidia neighbourhood was increased from every 4 days to every 2–3 days. This was achieved by reducing distribution losses from 40% to currently 30%. Sanitation activities include the construction of sewer networks and wastewater treatment. The town of Al Bireh had the only functioning wastewater treatment plant in the West Bank in 2009. The plant, which was funded by KfW, was commissioned in 2000 and operates in a <b>satisfactory</b> <b>way</b> despite the challenging environment of the West Bank. The construction of wastewater treatment plants in Gaza City, Western Nablus, Salfeet and the Tulkarem region, however, was substantially delayed as of 2009. Until 2008 new financial cooperation commitments were granted in the form of projects that identified specific investments at an early stage. This approach changed in 2008 with the approval of a new KfW-supported water and sanitation program for the West Bank and Gaza. This program is open for proposals from small and medium-sized towns if they comply with certain selection criteria. The program’s main focus is on water loss reduction.|$|E

The Chief Factor found the Provisional Government a <b>satisfactory</b> <b>way</b> to pursue the debts owed to the HBC by settlers, and protect company property against claim jumpers. Additionally he felt if the government were to openly declare independence from outside powers he could [...] "be elected head were I to retire among them." [...] The negotiations ended with the condition that only sales with settlers would be taxed. Taxes paid to the Provisional Government by the HBC and the Puget Sound Agricultural Company amounted to $226 that year. Several more employees of the HBC were then included in the government. Chief Trader James Douglas was appointed as a justice for Vancouver after the signing of the agreement and in 1846 he and fellow employee Henry Peers were elected to the legislature. If there were any sessions of the Vancouver court, none of the records or correspondence remain. Claims were filed by British subjects covering the HBC forts of Vancouver, Cowlitz, and Nisqually. Vancouver in particular was covered by 18 claims.|$|E

2500|$|In addition, Georgescu {{finds that}} neoclassical {{economics}} tends to overlook, or, at best, to misrepresent {{the problem of}} how to allocate the exhaustible mineral resources between present and future generations. Georgescu points out that the market mechanisms of supply and demand are systematically unable to work out the intergenerational allocation problem in a <b>satisfactory</b> <b>way,</b> since future generations are not, and cannot be, present on today's market. This anomaly of the market mechanisms — or ecological market failure — is described by Georgescu as 'a dictatorship of the present over the future'. [...] On this issue, notable economists and Nobel Prize laureates Robert Solow and Joseph Stiglitz, Georgescu's two main adversaries in academia in the 1970s, have stated their account of the mainstream neoclassical approach to the economics of exhaustible resources: They both claim that across the board substitutability of man-made capital for natural capital constitutes a real possibility. Hence, any concern with intergenerational allocation of the mineral stock should be relaxed somewhat (according to Solow); or even ignored altogether (according to Stiglitz).|$|E

30|$|Other {{studies have}} relied on intertemporal {{variation}} in incomes between siblings, but it is unclear that parents do not take compensatory actions {{in the face of}} differential financial resources associated with each sibling. If they do, then sibling studies estimate the effects net of those actions. Other studies look at value added in the form of changes in outcomes associated with changes in income over time to difference out unobserved heterogeneity. Similar studies use early measures of outcomes as controls for unobserved heterogeneity. However, estimation of such lagged dependent variable models are, in general, inconsistent in the presence of fixed child or family effects. Nor are they very <b>satisfactory</b> <b>ways</b> of dealing with endogeneity because income may, itself, respond to lagged outcomes – for example, a failing child may stimulate a parent to work harder, to provide more financial resources to allow the child to improve.|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{collaborative}} relationships {{require that}} any jointly produced resources be shared in mutually <b>satisfactory</b> <b>ways.</b> Prototypically, this sharing involves partners dividing up simultaneously available resources, {{but sometimes the}} collaboration makes a resource available to only one individual, and any sharing of resources must take place across repeated instances over time. Here, we show that beginning at 5 years of age, human children stabilize cooperation in such cases by taking turns across instances of obtaining a resource. In contrast, chimpanzees do not take turns in this way, and so their collaboration tends to disintegrate over time. Alternating turns in obtaining a collaboratively produced resource does not necessarily require a prosocial concern for the other, but rather requires only a strategic judgment that partners need incentives to continue collaborating. These results suggest {{that human beings are}} adapted for thinking strategically in ways that sustain long-term cooperative relationships and that are absent in their nearest primate relatives. ...|$|R
