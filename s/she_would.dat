5|$|Due to time constraints, some {{plot points}} of Asellus story were removed.

These quests were also intended to affect her scenario's ending.|$|E
5|$|Her husband {{announced}} {{his campaign for}} President of the United States in mid-1999, something that she agreed to. She did say, however, {{that she had never}} dreamed that he would run for office. The Bush campaign worked to assure voters that as First Lady, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not seek to emulate then-First Lady Hillary Clinton. When asked who <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be like out of the past First Ladies, she insisted it would be herself.|$|E
60|$|He {{dropped his}} hands to the counter by habit and {{stood for a moment}} {{regarding}} her awkwardly. What <b>would</b> <b>she</b> do? <b>Would</b> <b>she</b> cut him? She came across the shop to him.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly I {{was filled}} with the thought of her and a great longing for her. What <b>would</b> <b>she</b> do when she {{realised}} our immense disaster? What <b>would</b> <b>she</b> do? How <b>would</b> <b>she</b> take it? It filled me with astonishment to realise how little I could tell....|$|R
6000|$|BIGELOW--How can {{you keep}} repeating that--with Martha hardly cold in her grave! I ask you again, what <b>would</b> <b>she</b> think, how <b>would</b> <b>she</b> feel--If you <b>would</b> only consent to see this baby, I know you'd realize how damnably mad and cruel you are. Won't you--just for a second? ...|$|R

Aguilera reported that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> reschedule the tour in 2011, though the tour never happened.|$|E
500|$|Were <b>she</b> not merciless, <b>would</b> <b>she</b> {{kick the}} breast of her lord? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Would</b> <b>she</b> laugh? <b>Would</b> <b>she</b> {{take it as}} a joke? All {{eyes met}} her with a glance of eager curiosity, and she met all eyes with one of rebuff and coldness; she looked neither flurried nor merry: she walked stiffly to her seat, and took it in silence.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> could! <b>Would</b> <b>she</b> submit?--She? Her will {{should stand}} firm, her reason free, to the last--to the death if need be.... And yet last night!--last night! ...|$|R
5|$|In the {{afternoon}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{take a nap}} for two hours in her armchair, and then visit her neighbours in the care home, telling them about the latest news she had heard on the radio. At nightfall <b>she</b> <b>would</b> dine quickly, return to her room, listen to music (her eyesight now being too poor for her favorite pastime of crosswords), smoke a last cigarette {{and go to bed}} at 10pm.|$|E
5|$|Mary Davis {{announced}} on 26 May 2011 that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be seeking a nomination.

6000|$|Mrs. Gereth massed herself {{there more}} and more as an immoral woman, but Fleda had to {{recognize}} that <b>she</b> too <b>would</b> have been stupid and <b>she</b> too <b>would</b> have gratified her. [...] "And when did all this take place?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Juno 's diabolical plan {{seems to}} be working as she is able to {{convince}} Argo that the chance and rescue he has been given is all for the purpose of both of them to share a life together---can she expect everything from here on out to go her way? Meanwhile, still in pursuit, Eloida tries to convince Sabina to come with her---will <b>she</b> come? <b>Would</b> <b>she</b> fight? Or <b>would</b> <b>she</b> learn of the truth about herself? ...|$|R
6000|$|Amabel {{was lying}} on her bed, her Bible open by her; not exactly reading, but {{as if she was}} now and then finding a verse and {{dwelling}} on it. Gentle and serene <b>she</b> looked; but <b>would</b> <b>she</b> never weep? <b>would</b> those quiet blue eyes be always sleepless and tearless? ...|$|R
5|$|On July 30, 2013, Mays {{confirmed}} that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> depart the show after the fifth season {{to work on}} other projects, but stated that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be open to returning as a guest star in the future.|$|E
5|$|She {{suffered}} from bulimia very badly. That's not, like, a revelation – you knew {{just by looking}} at her… <b>She</b> <b>would</b> have died eventually, the way she was going, but what really killed her was the bulimia… I think that it left her weaker and more susceptible. Had she not had an eating disorder, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have been physically stronger.|$|E
5|$|After {{her mother}} {{announced}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{not run for}} re-election in 2014, Davis filed as a Democratic candidate for county clerk.

50|$|Suvannamaccha {{turned to}} Hanuman {{and her eyes}} were filled with love. No more, <b>she</b> said, <b>would</b> <b>she</b> prevent Hanuman from {{completing}} his mission. Her mermaids underwater would, in fact, return all the stolen rocks to the causeway.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wouldn't <b>she,</b> now? What <b>would</b> <b>she</b> be? Can {{either of}} {{you tell me what}} the wife of a Prince of Chitakov would call herself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|All {{offences}} {{seemed to}} be forgotten in the burning desire for an introduction to this marvel of success. Constance had {{made the most of}} her opportunities in gazing at church; but if <b>she</b> called, <b>would</b> <b>she</b> be introduced? ...|$|R

5|$|Anne saw an {{opportunity}} in Henry's infatuation and the convenient moral quandary. She determined that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> yield to his embraces only as his acknowledged queen. She began to take her place at his side in policy and in state, but not yet in his bed.|$|E
6000|$|Human justice! What is justice? See {{how it can}} err! Was {{there ever}} such a boundless, {{unlimited}} blunder in the whole annals of penny fiction? Probably not. I remember nothing like it in all the learned pages of the London Journal and the Family Herald. Mrs. Henry Wood and Miss Braddon never dreamed of aught like this. Philippa must be told. It was too good a joke. <b>Would</b> <b>she</b> laugh? <b>Would</b> <b>she</b> be alarmed? ...|$|R
40|$|What {{if we were}} {{privy to}} the {{innermost}} thoughts and feelings {{of one of our}} international students? What if we could read what she wrote home to her Mum and Dad and her best friend? What if we could read what she dared not even tell them, revealed only in her diary? What <b>would</b> <b>she</b> say about living in Australia? What <b>would</b> <b>she</b> say about the people <b>she</b> met? What <b>would</b> <b>she</b> say about the university and about our teaching? Now we can, and it is very revealing...|$|R
60|$|How <b>would</b> <b>she</b> look? <b>Would</b> {{her face}} have that oldtime peachy bloom, her mouth that {{peculiar}} beautiful curve? She {{was large and}} fair, he recalled, hair yellow and shining, eyes blue-He roused himself. This was nonsense! He was trembling. He composed himself by looking around again.|$|R

60|$|Wessex {{had seemed}} {{relieved}} when the Queen entered, and Ursula knew that never again <b>would</b> <b>she</b> {{be allowed to}} see him alone, never again <b>would</b> <b>she</b> {{be able to speak}} to him undisturbed.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Would</b> <b>she</b> go on {{down the}} river, that she might thus bring herself nearer her own Grabritin, or <b>would</b> <b>she</b> have sought to search for us upstream, where she had seen us last? ...|$|R
60|$|Ah! He was {{not going}} to say: <b>She</b> doesn't! It <b>would</b> be caddish to say that. Even if she didn't count--Did <b>she</b> still?--it <b>would</b> be mean and low. And in his eyes just then there was the look that had made his tutor compare him to a lion cub in trouble.|$|R
