40|$|International audienceThe {{evolution}} of the global orientation parameter {{for a series of}} aqueous hydroxypropylcellulose solutions both during and following the cessation of a steady-state <b>shear</b> <b>Bow</b> is reported. Time-resolved orientation measurements were made in situ through a novel X-ray rheometer coupled with a two-dimensional electronic X-ray camera, and using an intense X-ray source at the LURE synchrotron. After the cessation of flow, the global orientation decreases from the steady state orientation level to zero following shear flow at a low shear rate or to a small but finite value after flow at a high shear rate. The decrease of orientation with time shows different behaviour, dependent upon the previously applied shear rate...|$|E
40|$|We show photorheology in aqueous {{solutions}} of weakly entangled wormlike micelles {{prepared with}} cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), salicylic acid (HSal), and dilute {{amounts of the}} photochromic multistate compound trans- 2, 4, 4 '-trihydroxychalcone (Ct). Different chemical species of Ct are associated with different colorations and propensities to reside within or outside CTAB micelles. A light-induced transfer between the intra- and intermicellar space is used to alter the mean length of wormlike micelles and hence the rheological properties of the fluid, studied in steady-state <b>shear</b> <b>Bow</b> and in dynamic rheological measurements. Light-induced changes of fluid rheology are reversible by a the relaxation process. at relaxation rates which depend on pH and which are consistent with photochromic reversion rates measured by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. Parameterizing viscoelostic rheological states by their effective relaxation time tau(c) and corresponding response modulus G(c), we find the light and dark states of the system to fall onto a characteristic state curve defined by comparable experiments conducted without photosensitive components. These reference experiments were prepared with the same concentration of CTAB, but different concentrations of HSal or sodium salicylote (NaSal), and tested at different temperatures...|$|E
50|$|Blade shears {{are similar}} to scissors, {{although}} most have the hinge {{at the back of}} the shears rather than the center but some still have the hinge in the center e.g. Jakoti shears. Conventional blade shears can come with a single bow, double bows or inverse <b>bows.</b> Double <b>bow</b> <b>shears</b> are by far the most common as they are the most versatile. Single <b>bow</b> <b>shears</b> and inverse <b>bowed</b> <b>shears</b> offer more resistance and are mostly only used for tough shearing sheep. They come in varying lengths from about 10 cm(4inches) to 18.5 cm(7.25inches).|$|R

Two lookouts {{are posted}} next to the periscope <b>shears.</b> Her <b>bow</b> planes are rigged in, main gun visible on deck aft. Notice the limber holes and saddle ballast tanks.|$|R
40|$|The {{high-temperature}} creep-deformation {{behavior of}} a Ni-based M 963 superalloy has been investigated over a broad stress range of 80 to 600 MPa at high temperatures (800 °C to 975 °C). The detailed dislocation configurations at different creep stages are examined through transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The {{results show that the}} deformation mechanism is stress and temperature dependent and mainly consists of three dislocation-controlling mechanisms: stacking faults and dislocation-pair <b>shearing,</b> dislocation <b>bowing</b> and Orowan looping, and dislocation climb...|$|R
5000|$|On 17 October, {{she arrived}} off Paramushiro and, that evening, {{she took up}} station off the {{southeast}} coast of the island to patrol the entrances to Musashi Wan and Onekotan Strait. On the morning of 18 October, she sighted two ships at anchor in Musashi Wan, and, after a periscope check disclosed no other ships in the area, she began working her way to an attack position west or southwest of the targets. Moving slowly, with short and infrequent periscope exposures, through the calm and poorly charted bay, she went up for a final check at 10:23. While looking, she struck an uncharted sand bar. The S-boat, her tubes ready for firing, angled up 10 degrees. Her depth gauge showed 32 ft. During the next few seconds she slid over the bar, apparently showing periscope <b>shears,</b> <b>bow,</b> and, possibly, the whole bridge structure; then, over the bar, she took a down angle at high speed. At 10:25, she fired. Two torpedoes set at six feet, were sent against each of the targets. On firing the fourth and final [...] "fish", she changed course and maneuvered at high speed toward the open sea. Two explosions were heard as she cleared the immediate area. At 10:45, she came to periscope depth to observe the damage.|$|R
2500|$|On 2 November 1943, while attacking an Allied {{task force}} off Bougainville in the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay, Hatsukaze {{collided}} with the cruiser [...] The collision <b>sheared</b> off her <b>bow,</b> leaving her dead in the water. Hatsukaze and the light cruiser [...] were sunk (at position [...] ) by Allied destroyer gunfire. Of those on board, 164 were killed, including its commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Buichi Ashida.|$|R
5000|$|Three days later, by periscope, the {{submarine}} spotted a 950-ton [...] "sea truck", similar to Sanko Maru, at 2000 yd, close inshore. Unescorted, the Japanese presented a tempting target for a gun attack, but, {{no sooner had}} Thornback’s periscope <b>shears</b> and <b>bow</b> broken the surface, than the target slipped into the misty weather. Not to be daunted, Thornback followed, playing a cat and mouse game, and fired five torpedoes. All missed. She later sighted the enemy again, missed with three more torpedoes, and took the [...] "sea truck" [...] under fire. Despite poor visibility, Thornback closed to 300 yd and scored numerous hits with the 40 millimeter guns. The target, however, was able to move closer inshore and escaped in the fog which closed around her like a shroud.|$|R

40|$|The {{derivation}} of {{a narrow}} plate model that accommodates <b>shearing,</b> torsional, and <b>bowing</b> effects is presented. The resulting system has mathematical and computational advantages since {{it is in the}} form of a system of differential equations depending on only one spatial variable. A validation of the model against frequency data observed in laboratory experiments is presented. The models may be easily combined to form more complicated structures that are hinged along all or portions of their junction boundaries or are coupled differentiably as through the insertion of dowels between the narrow plates. Computational examples are presented to illustrate the types of deformations possible by coupling these models...|$|R
500|$|Columbus had {{at least}} three accidents. In June 1895 she {{suffered}} an explosion caused by a steam pipe becoming disconnected while she was underway. Accounts differ, but some claim that this happened during a race with her rival, Virginia. In July 1905, she collided with the schooner Ralph Campbell in the Chicago River. On June 30, 1917, {{she was involved in}} her most serious accident, a collision with a water tower. The collision happened in Milwaukee while she was being maneuvered by tugs away from her dock. The Milwaukee River current caught her, spinning her sideways, and her <b>bow</b> <b>sheared</b> off two legs of the Yahr-Lang Drug Company's water tower, toppling it and flooding Columbus decks with about [...] The collision killed 16passengers and severely damaged her pilot house, putting her out of service {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|R
5000|$|Amagiri {{continued}} to be used on [...] "Tokyo Express" [...] missions {{through the end of}} 1943. She engaged United States Navy destroyers in combat at the Battle of Cape St. George in late November, and escaped pursuing American destroyers led by Captain Arleigh Burke. On 7 December, she collided near Kavieng with the destroyer , which <b>sheared</b> off her <b>bow.</b> Sent back to Kure Naval Arsenal for repairs in January 1944, she was reassigned to the Southwest Area Fleet in March and was based in Singapore to provide escort for transport missions in the western Netherlands East Indies. On 23 April, after departing Singapore with heavy cruiser [...] and light cruiser [...] bound for Davao, Amagiri struck a naval mine in Makassar Strait [...] south of Balikpapan at position (...) [...] As she took over two hours to sink, there were few casualties.|$|R
2500|$|Captain Cecil had {{positioned}} {{himself on the}} [...] "fighting bridge" [...] an open air command area. This was just below the forward main battery directors {{in an area that}} protruded a bit giving him panoramic observation of events. Directly below Cecil's position was the enclosed pilot house where Commander Carpenter stood overseeing operations there. Communications were done by a voice tube. Before the Helena opened fire to port at 0157 hours, Carpenter {{and the rest of the}} crew were at their battle stations. About seven minutes after she opened fire at about 0203 hours, the Helena was hit by a torpedo. The first enemy Type 93 torpedo, also called a Long Lance, could travel at 48–50 knots (56 to 57 Mph) and impacted the Helena on the port side just below number one turret (near frame 32) tearing off the bow of the ship. As the tall column of water thrown up by the explosion began to fall, the ship staggered then began to surge ahead as the <b>bow</b> <b>sheared</b> off to starboard.|$|R
2500|$|On 21 January 1944, Aikoku Maru {{loaded the}} 629 {{men of the}} 66th Naval Guard Unit, with ammunition, {{supplies}} and construction materials. The convoy was attacked [...] NW of Truk by the submarine , which sank the minelayer [...] and transport Yasukuni Maru; however, Aikoku Maru was undamaged and reached Truk on 1 February. After making an abortive run to Brown Island, she returned to Truk on 16 February to find {{that most of the}} capital ships had evacuated the base in anticipation of an impending American attack. Aikoku Maru began loading ammunition and making preparations for departure to Rabaul, loading troops of the 1st Amphibious Brigade. However, before preparations were complete, Operation Hailstone began, with the US Navy Task Force 58 striking at Truk with 30 air strikes of over 150 aircraft each every hour for a period of two days. On the first day, 17 February 1944, Aikoku Maru was bombed by aircraft from the carrier , with the first bomb exploding in the officer's wardroom, causing a fire. She was hit three more times in this attack, and was hit again in the second attack by a torpedo which set off the ammunition in her No.1 hold, <b>shearing</b> off the <b>bow.</b> Aikoku Maru sank in two minutes at , with most of the 945 crew and passengers. The aircraft which dropped the torpedo on Aikoku Maru- TBM Avenger #25270 and its three men crew of VT-6- were also destroyed in the explosion of the ship.|$|R
