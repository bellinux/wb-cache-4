5|$|When foraging, {{scaly-breasted munia}} can search as {{individuals}} or search for others that have found food and join them. The economic {{consequences of the}} decision to join others has been modeled in two ways: the producer-scrounger model and the information <b>sharing</b> <b>model.</b> These models are based on hypotheses that differ in the degree of compatibility that is assumed between the two food and joining opportunity search modes.|$|E
5|$|The {{information}} <b>sharing</b> <b>model</b> {{assumes that}} individuals search concurrently for finding and joining opportunities while the producer-scrounger model {{assumes that the}} search modes are mutually exclusive. Hopping with the head facing up and downward are observed to be statistically associated with the frequencies of a bird's joining and finding, respectively. When the expected stable frequency of the scrounger tactic was altered by changing the availability of seeds, the relative frequency of hopping with the head up changed accordingly. When the seed distribution made the scrounger tactic unprofitable, the frequency of hopping with the head up diminished and appears to support the predictions of the producer-scrounger model.|$|E

40|$|The {{commonly}} used market <b>share</b> <b>models</b> are {{all based on}} the implicit assumption of a homogeneous population. However, studies of individual brand choice behavior tend to reject this basic premise. In this paper we attempt to explain why market <b>share</b> <b>models</b> perform well {{in spite of this}} underlying misspecification. A model which describes the individual's brand choice behavior is presented. This model allows an individual to follow either the Bernoulli, Markov or Linear Learning process as well as have different parameters from other people following the same process. A market <b>share</b> <b>model</b> which takes full account of this heterogeneity is derived and is compared to the traditional market <b>share</b> <b>model</b> in which homogeneous of consumers is assumed. The error in prediction which would result from the use of the homogeneous model is specified and its properties are examined. Conditions for the use, of the gravitational-type market <b>share</b> <b>model,</b> and, the first order lagged market <b>share</b> <b>model</b> are provided. It is shown that the homogeneous market <b>share</b> <b>model</b> will do well in time-series estimation but that the results will not always be appropriate for use in managerial decisions regarding forecasting and optimization. marketing, marketing: buyer behavior, marketing: measurement...|$|R

[...] Instead, MLSE looked for $10 million in public funding from each of the municipal, provincial, and federal governments to top up their $90 million contribution, plus any cost overruns, for the expansion. [...] MLSE argued that the new stadium would result in $8 million in economic benefits, including taxes, accruing to the province annually, and $18 million in taxes on the construction project. [...] The company has agreed to pay a fixed annual rental fee of $865,000 to the City for the upgraded stadium, rather than the variable revenue <b>sharing</b> <b>model</b> under the present agreement which returned an average of $397,000 to the city over the previous five years, to help ensure that the city recoups its investment. [...] The new arrangement guaranteed the city $25.4 million, and with the projected $6 million in parking revenues the $31 million in revenue over the term of the lease would be $19 million more than under the former agreement. [...] As manager of the stadium, MLSE gets any profit turned by the stadium, and is responsible for any losses. [...] MLSE's management and naming rights agreement for the stadium, which was set to expire in 2027, were extended by 10 years under the proposal. [...] The agreement requires MLSE to reach a [...] "long-term use (i.e. 20 years)" [...] lease with the Argos for usage of the stadium starting in 2015. [...] The proposed renovations were unanimously approved by the Board of Governors of Exhibition Place on March 7, and the City of Toronto's Executive Committee gave their consent on March 19. [...] The full City Council approved the deal on April 3, and the agreement is planned to be finalized by June 15. [...] The Provincial Minister of Tourism and Culture Michael Chan said that MLSE has submitted a funding request that that [...] "we are looking at it", while the Federal Infrastructure Minister Denis Lebel's spokesperson said that [...] "the federal government has no program to fund professional sports facilities".

40|$|In {{this paper}} three {{different}} roles of a <b>shared</b> task <b>model</b> {{as an intermediate}} representation of a task are presented and illustrated by applications developed in cooperation with industry. First {{the role of a}} <b>shared</b> task <b>model</b> in knowledge acquisition is discussed. In one of the two applications, decision support in the domain of soil sanitation, one of the existing generic task models for diagnostic reasoning provided a means to structure knowledge acquisition. In the second application, diagnosis of chemical processes, the acquisition process resulted in a <b>shared</b> task <b>model</b> for diagnostic reasoning on Nylon- 6 production. Secondly, the role of a <b>shared</b> task <b>model</b> in designing user interaction is addressed. Three levels of interaction are considered of importance: interaction at the object level, at the level of strategic preferences, and at the level of task modification. In an application in the domain of environmental decision making, this led to the design of a user interface based on the acquired <b>shared</b> task <b>model,</b> within which all three levels of interaction were available to users. Finally, the role of <b>shared</b> task <b>models</b> within a multi-agent system including a clarification agent is addressed. Two software agents were designed that each <b>share</b> a task <b>model</b> with the user: one for a diagnosis task, and one for a clarification task. The <b>shared</b> <b>model</b> of the clarification task reflects the <b>shared</b> task <b>model</b> of diagnosis; clarification includes clarification of the overall diagnostic reasoning process. The multi-agent architecture presented has been developed to support a user both {{at the level of the}} diagnostic task he or she is performing and at the level of clarification.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to show that the MultiNomial Logit (MNL) framework can be used for deriving simple acreage <b>share</b> <b>models.</b> More specifically we show thatMNLacreage choice models can be defined as parts of consistent multicropmodels. When coupled with suitably designed crop production models, e. g. a specific parameterization of the standard quadratic yield function, the parameters of these multicrop models are easily interpreted and estimated. Although MNL acreage choice models are usually derived by aggregating crop choices defined at the plot level, we show that these models can also be derived by considering a profit maximisation problem at the farm level. This provides a simple theoretical background for the Standard MNL acreage <b>share</b> <b>model,</b> as well as for simple extensions of these models: the Nested MNL acreage <b>share</b> <b>models.</b> An empirical application on French farm-level data over the period 1996 – 2007 investigates the empirical performances of the multicrop econometric models based on the proposed MNL framework for modelling acreage choices...|$|R
