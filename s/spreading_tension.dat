40|$|PURPOSE: Although the {{communication}} that occurs within health care teams {{is important to}} both team function and the socialization of novices, the nature of team communication and its educational influence are not well documented. This study explored the nature of communications among operating room (OR) team members from surgery, nursing, and anesthesia to identify common communicative patterns, sites of tension, {{and their impact on}} novices. METHOD: Paired researchers observed 128 hours of OR interactions during 35 procedures from four surgical divisions at one teaching hospital. Brief, unstructured interviews were conducted following each observation. Field notes were independently read by each researcher and coded for emergent themes in the grounded theory tradition. Coding consensus was achieved via regular discussion. Findings were returned to insider 2 ̆ 2 experts 2 ̆ 2 for their assessment of authenticity and adequacy. RESULTS: Patterns of communication were complex and socially motivated. Dominant themes were time, safety and sterility, resources, roles, and situation. Communicative tension arose regularly in relation to these themes. Each procedure had one to four 2 ̆ 2 higher-tension 2 ̆ 2 events, which often had a ripple effect, <b>spreading</b> <b>tension</b> to other participants and contexts. Surgical trainees responded to tension by withdrawing from {{the communication}} or mimicking the senior staff surgeon. Both responses had negative implications for their own team relations.

The Youngs modulus of the gels was tuned between 1500 (’soft’) and 6000 (’hard’) Pa. The evolution of cell tractions was computed from the gel deformation measured every 30 sec by tracking the displacements of ﬂuorescent beads (ø 0. 5 µm) embedded at the gel surface.

Fibroblasts interacting with 3 D relaxed collagen matrices appear much different from cells on 2 D collagen-coated surfaces and form dendritic cell extensions that contain microtubule cores and actin-rich tips. We found that interfering with cellular microtubules caused cells in relaxed matrices to remain round and unable to form dendritic extensions, whereas fibroblasts on coverslips formed lamellipodial extensions and were spread completely without microtubules but were unable to become polarized. Fibroblasts in relaxed collagen matrices lack stress fibers, focal adhesions, and focal adhesion signaling. Fibroblasts on collagen-coated coverslips that were unable to develop stress fibers and focal adhesions, because of either adding blebbistatin to the cells or use of soft coverslips, also formed microtubule-dependent dendritic extensions. Conversely, fibroblasts interacting with precontracted collagen matrices developed stress fibers and lamellipodial extensions and required microtubules for polarization but not spreading. Our findings demonstrate an unexpected relationship between the role of microtubules in cell <b>spreading</b> and the <b>tension</b> state of cell–matrix interactions.

40|$|High Q mirror {{suspensions}} are a {{key element}} of the advanced interferometric gravitational-wave detectors. In December 2002 the last of the final interferometer optics of GEO 600 were monolithically suspended, using fused silica fibres. The violin modes of the suspension fibres can have Q greater than 10 (8) and can therefore interfere with the interferometer length control servo. Hence, the violin modes need to be damped, without degrading the pendulum Q itself. Furthermore, the frequency spread of the fibres used has to be small to allow for high Q notch filtering in the length control servo. ne requirements for the violin modes of the two GEO 600 inboard suspensions are Q lt 3 x 10 (6) for the fundamental and Q lt 2 x 10 (6) for the first harmonic mode, respectively. The frequency spread should not exceed 10 % within one mode. To accomplish that, two sections of the fibres were coated with amorphous Teflon. By applying the coating, the Q of the relevant modes can be degraded to the desired values and furthermore, the frequencies of these modes can be tuned almost independently with a good accuracy over a wide range. After welding the fibres in the monolithic suspension, a corrective coating was applied to some fibres, to compensate for the frequency spread due to the <b>tension</b> <b>spread</b> of the four fibres within a suspension.

40|$|When two liquids of {{different}} surface tensions come into contact, the liquid with lower surface <b>tension</b> <b>spreads</b> {{over the other}} as this configuration minimizes the total free energy. This Marangoni-driven spreading has been studied for various geometries and surfactants, but {{the dynamics of the}} binary geometry (drop-drop) has hardly been quantitatively investigated, despite its relevance for droplet encapsulation applications. It is furthermore unclear whether these different situations possess universal dynamics. Here we use laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) to observe the dynamics of binary droplets as a function of surface tension difference between the liquids Δσ and viscosity η. The distance L over which the low-surface-tension liquid has covered the high-surface-tension droplet is measured. The early-stage spreading dynamics is described by the power-law L(t) ∼ t^α with α = 3 / 4, as expected based on scaling arguments for viscosity-limited spreading on a deep bath. This exponent decreases in a later stage, when the boundary layer thickness becomes comparable to the droplet diameter D. Spreading is dissipation-inhibited for viscosities corresponding to Ohnesorge numbers Oh = η/√(ρΔσ D) ≳ 0. 2 where ρ is the density. Finally, we show that our results collapse onto a single curve of rescaled distance L̃(t̃) as a function of rescaled time t̃, which also captures previous results for different geometries, surface tension modifiers (both solvents and surfactants), and miscibility. As this curve spans 7 orders of magnitude, we conclude that Marangoni-induced spreading is a universal phenomenon for most practically encountered liquid-liquid systems.

40|$|Cell {{behaviours}} within tissues {{are influenced}} by {{a broad array of}} physical and biochemical microenvironmental factors. Whilst 2 ̆ 7 stiffness 2 ̆ 7 is a recognised physical property of substrates and tissue microenvironments that influences many cellular behaviours, tissues and their extracellular matrices are not purely rigid but 2 ̆ 7 viscoelastic 2 ̆ 7 materials, composed of both rigid-like (elastic) and dissipative (viscous) elements. This viscoelasticity results in materials displaying increased deformation with time under the imposition of a defined force or stress, a phenomenon referred to as time-dependent deformation or 2 ̆ 7 creep 2 ̆ 7. Previously, we compared the behaviour of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) on hydrogels tailored to have a constant stiffness, but to display varying levels of creep in response to an applied force. Using polyacrylamide as a model material, we showed that on high-creep hydrogels (HCHs), hMSCs displayed increased proliferation, spread area and differentiation towards multiple lineages, compared to their purely stiff analogue, with a particular propensity for differentiation towards a smooth muscle cell (SMC) lineage. In this present study, we investigate the mechanisms behind this phenomenon and show that hMSCs adhered to HCHs have increased expression of SMC induction factors, including soluble factors, ECM proteins and the cell-cell adhesion molecule, N-Cadherin. Further, we identify a key role for Rac 1 signalling in mediating this increased N-Cadherin expression. Using a real-time Rac 1 -FRET biosensor, we confirm increased Rac 1 activation on HCHs, an observation that is further supported functionally by observed increases in motility and lamellipodial protrusion rates of hMSCs. Increased Rac 1 activity in hMSCs on HCHs provides underlying mechanisms for enhanced commitment towards a SMC lineage and the compensatory increase in <b>spread</b> area (isotonic <b>tension)</b> after a creep-induced loss of cytoskeletal tension on viscoelastic substrates, in contrast to previous studies that have consistently demonstrated up-regulation of RhoA activity with increasing substrate stiffness.

40|$|Keywords: emulsion, <b>spreading</b> coefficient, surface <b>tension,</b> emulsifier, whipped cream, dairy foam, partial {{coalescence}} In this thesis, {{the interaction}} between emulsion droplets and expanding air/water interfaces was investigated. The objective was to deepen our knowledge concerning the physical processes that {{take place at the}} expanding air surfaces that form during aeration of emulsions. Emulsions can become aerated as a result of various processing operations, for example, stirring or pouring. Moreover, emulsions may be aerated with the intention of producing an aerated food product such as whipped cream or ice cream. Emulsion droplet/air interaction can have important consequences for emulsion stability. For example, emulsion droplet spreading at the air/water interface can initiate a collective oil spreading mechanism, resulting in the spreading of many oil droplets. This may lead to coalescence of the emulsion droplets. The tendency for an oil droplet to spread at an expanding air/water interface depends on the values of the dynamic interfacial tensions at the air/water, oil/water and oil/air interfaces. This can be expressed in terms of a dynamic spreading coefficient; when the spreading coefficient is positive, oil spreads out of the droplets. Experimental results confirmed that oil indeed only spreads out of emulsion droplets if the dynamic spreading coefficient is positive. The tendency for an emulsion droplet to spread at the air/water interface could be controlled by manipulating the surface expansion rate, the protein type and concentration, and type and concentration of emulsifier in the emulsion. The presence of crystalline fat, although relevant to the stability of emulsions exposed to shear, was not found to influence the spreading behaviour of emulsion droplets at the air/water interface. The results of the emulsion droplet spreading experiments lead {{to the development of a}} model that describes the whipping time of cream in terms of the proportion of the air bubble surface for which the spreading coefficient is positive. Experimental results for the whipping of model creams could be well explained by this model...|$|R
40|$|The {{most recent}} {{work in this}} line of {{investigation}} is a solo 'cello piece called 'Invisibility' which also acts as a study piece for an orchestral work (Pearl, Ochre Hair String) that I'm currently writing. One of things I wanted to explore in this piece for 'cello was to work with an interactivity at the material level of the instrument – that is, the strings, their resonance properties and how the strings are set into motion or stopped. Firstly, I retuned the strings so rather than having the fairly even <b>spread</b> of <b>tension</b> achieved in standard tuning (C-G-D-A), each string is retuned at a different level of tension, each string has {{a different kind of}} 'give' or resistance. The tuning is B (the lowest string dropped by a semitone), F (the next string lowered by a tone), the third string stays the same at D and the highest string is radically detuned down to Dsharp. As weIl as these different tensions held in the strings, I employ two types of bows to activate the strings – a normal bow and then a second bow which I call a 'guiro' bow after the serrated South American percussion instrument. The bow hair is wrapped around the wood to give an alternating hair and wood playing surface. The two bows bring different weights and qualities of greater or lesser friction into the equation of how the instrument is sounded. From the player's point of view, how it 'feeIs' under the fingers is quite different – there is more variation than usual – places of resistance or flow that need to be navigated when playing the music. This physical set-up foregrounds the material or physical aspect of the 'cello – a more interactive playing surface is created where the 'cello is not just an instrument that is somehow passively acted upon but it has torque, it has lines of forces that directs how it is to be played. In a real sense, the 'cello also plays the musician and it governs the shaping of the music sounds in a very direct way. The 'invisibility' of the title of the piece is not about silence, for the work is full of sounds. Rather, as in Grosz' and Deleuze's conception, I'm working with an idea of the invisible or latent forces of the physical set-up of the instrument. What emerges as the instrument is sounded in various increasingly rhythmicised ways, is a landscape of unpredictable nicks and ruptures as different layers of action - speed, tension, pressure of the bows, of the strings - flow across each other. The composition also works with magnifications of the level of these disruptions by intensifying various paradoxical combinations - eg: playing a string at a non-harmonic node so that the string vibrates in highly complex ways. The string doesn't settle in any one vibrational zone but flicks or flickers (shimmers) between states so that what results is an unpredictable array of different noises and harmonics. The two kinds of bow used in the piece offer different possibilities of friction, for instance, the stop/start structure of the serrated bow adds an uneven granular layer of articulation over every sound. Like the cross-hatched designs or dotting effects of Aboriginal art, the bow creates a highly mobile sonic surface through which you can hear the outlines of other kinds of movements and shapes. Moving rapidly between places of relative stability and instability in terms of how the 'cello is sounded, the piece shows up patterns of contraction and expansion, accumulation and dissipation, aligning with forces that are at work within the instrument-performer complex...|$|R
40|$|National audienceRecent {{observations}} {{have raised}} the hypothesis that biochemical pathways could be involved in cloud chemistry and physics. Indeed, cloud water carries about ~ 104 microorganisms mL- 1, and a metabolic activity has been detected in cloud water samples. Since 2003, more than 34 cloud events have been sampled from the puy de Dôme summit (1465 m a. s. l., France) using droplet samplers. These have been characterized for their chemical and microbiological contents, and viable bacterial strains have been isolated by culture. In laboratory, we are currently focusing on the capacity of isolates in (i) initiating the formation of ice crystals and act as ice nuclei (IN), (ii) producing biosurfactants and initiate the formation of cloud droplets (cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)) and (iii) transforming the organic compounds present in the atmosphere (formate, acetate, lactate, succinate, oxalate, formaldehyde and methanol). Experimental setups (microcosms) consist of bacterial suspensions incubated in liquid solutions of which the chemical composition reflects that of our cloud water samples: these have been designed for mimicking the conditions encountered under either oceanic or anthropic influence. The capacity of selected isolates to catalyze the formation of ice was tested by immersion freezing and in cloud chamber (AIDA, Karlsruhe). Ice nucleation active bacteria at - 5 °C were found in cloud samples; in cloud water, such cells could {{be responsible for the}} freezing of droplets into crystals, which often initiates precipitations. Preliminary analysis of the data showed that the IN efficiency of the isolates was dependent on the chemical composition of cloud water. Isolates have also been screened for biosurfactant production, by emulsification, oil <b>spreading</b> and surface <b>tension</b> meniscus tests. A majority of strains were positive to at least one test, suggesting that such cells would be efficient CCN in the atmosphere and could participate to the formation of liquid clouds. In order to investigate the implication of microbes in the chemistry of cloud water, the rates of biotransformation of atmospheric organic compounds by isolated strains under microcosm conditions have been determined. They were in the range of ~ 10 - 2 pmol- 1 cell- 1 d- 1 at 5 °C and were in general decreased in the “anthropic” versus “oceanic” medium. The presence of free radicals such as OH● was also detrimental. A basic numeric model of atmospheric chemistry taking into account realistic concentrations of organic compounds, of bacteria, and of OH● and NO 3 ● radicals in a liquid cloud at 5 °C for daytime and nighttime and their respective reaction rates towards the tested organic acids was applied on the results. This confirmed that the presence of OH● radicals was largely responsible for the oxidation of organic species during the day, but it is noteworthy that during the night, bacterial activity would dominate the reactivity of formic, acetic and succinic acids by contributing to more than 90 % of their degradation. Overall, our results suggest that cloudborne microorganisms are actors of the physico-chemical processes occurring in the atmosphere. The composition of cloud water modulates these roles, and this raises the question of the negative impact that human emissions could have on the capacity of microbes to interact with atmospheric processes and disseminate by the atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|Natural fibres are a {{realistic}} and ecological alternative to synthetic fibres as reinforcement for polymer composite materials {{due to their}} low cost, environmental friendliness, natural abundance, and mechanical properties. The latter allows the design of composite materials to meet specific mechanical properties. For instance, bamboo exhibits a combination of low density (~ 1. 4 g/cm³) and high stiffness (~ 43 GPa) and strength (~ 800 MPa), while coir fibres are not very strong and stiff, but exhibit high strain to failure (approximately 40 %). However, their potential as reinforcing agent is reduced when compatibility problems with polymer matrices arise at the interface. The generally hydrophilic nature of natural fibres produces low interfacial interactions with certain important hydrophobic thermoplastic matrices, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, leading to a poor interfacial strength. Mechanical properties of composite materials can be greatly affected by the bond strength at the fibre-matrix interface. When a composite structure is loaded, the load is transferred from the matrix to the fibres mainly through shear stresses at the interface. Load transfer increases with increasing interfacial (shear) stresses, thus improving the composite strength. The adhesion at the interface {{can be described as}} a combination of physical adhesion (related to wettability), chemical bonding, and mechanical interlocking. In this study, the wettability and compatibility of the fibre and the matrix is assessed by the analysis of their surface energies. This is done by measuring contact angles, which is a quantitative measure of solid-liquid molecular interactions and thus provides information on the surface energy of solids. This dissertation develops an interdisciplinary and integrated approach that deals with the physical, chemical, and mechanical aspects of natural bamboo fibre composite interfaces. The wetting and mechanical behaviour at the interface of smooth and isotropic synthetic fibres (glass, polyethylene terephthalate) are compared with that of a rough and anisotropic natural fibre (bamboo). Atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), and optical profilometry techniques were used to study the fibres topography and chemistry. A new approach, based on an autoclave treatment, to reduce the noise in performing contact angle measurements on rough natural fibre surfaces is presented. The results indicate that the high concentration of lignin on the surface of bamboo fibres is responsible for their surface wetting properties. The wetting dynamics of various test liquids on bamboo fibres is analysed by applying the molecular-kinetic theory of wetting. The surface free energy components are calculated according to the acidbase theory. These values are then used to calculate the theoretical work of adhesion, <b>spreading</b> coefficient, wetting <b>tension,</b> and interfacial energy for analysing the fibre-matrix compatibility. Additionally, a novel way to measure equilibrium contact angles by using sound excitation is proposed. This way it is possible to better take into account both polar and dispersive surface energy components. The findings suggest that the contact angle obtained by forcing relaxation through acoustic vibration is a reliable method to study the wetting behaviour of natural fibres. Moreover, understanding of the stress state in the composite after processing and during mechanical testing is required for a correct analysis of adhesion properties. The mechanical strength of the interfaces was assessed by single fibre pull-out tests, and transverse 3 -point bending tests. The fibre matrix interfacial bond strength was characterized by the critical local value of interfacial shear stress. Since during crack initiation in the pull-out test, the crack surfaces move directly apart, it is possible to correctly relate the theoretical work of adhesion with the normal stress at the debond point. This radial normal stress at the interface at the moment of crack initiation is also used in this study as a parameter for correlating thermodynamic work of adhesion and practical adhesion. <w:latentstyles deflockedstate="false" defunhidewhenused="true"  <w:lsdexception="" locked="false" priority=" 0 " semihidden="false"  <w:latentstyles=""  status: publishe...|$|R
