40|$|SummaryObjectiveDetermine how stepoff incongruities of {{the distal}} tibia affect {{aggregate}} (whole-cycle) contact stresses and contact <b>stress</b> <b>gradients</b> {{for a complete}} motion cycle in human cadaveric ankles. MethodTen human cadaveric ankles were subjected to quasiphysiologic forces during stance-phase range of motion. Each specimen was loaded intact, with anatomic reduction of the anterolateral quarter of the distal tibia, and with increasing stepoffs of the anterolateral fragment up to 4. 0 mm. Transient contact stresses were measured using a custom-built, real-time stress transducer that sampled stresses at 132 Hz at 1472 separate foci (sensels). Aggregate stresses were calculated by summing the sequential transient stress values multiplied by the transient sampling duration for the complete motion cycle at each sensel. Transient contact <b>stress</b> <b>gradients</b> were calculated at each sensel using a central-differencing formula applied to adjacent transient stress measurements. Aggregate contact <b>stress</b> <b>gradients</b> were calculated by vector summation of sequential transient <b>stress</b> <b>gradients</b> multiplied by the sampling duration. ResultsCompared to the intact configuration, anatomic reduction of the fragment caused minimal changes in aggregate contact <b>stresses</b> and <b>stress</b> <b>gradients</b> (30 % increase compared to intact values). In contrast, stepoffs caused substantial increases (200 % increase compared to intact values) in peak and mean whole-cycle <b>stresses</b> and <b>gradients.</b> ConclusionsAggregate contact <b>stresses</b> and <b>stress</b> <b>gradients</b> quantify loading history for the complete motion cycle.

30|$|A {{possible}} {{explanation of the}} just mentioned elasticity effect {{might be related to}} the normal stress distribution around the particle. It is likely to assume that, as the particle approaches the right corner of the bifurcation, the shear rate gradients in the fluid gap between the particle surface and the wall are very large. The large shear rate gradients lead to large normal <b>stress</b> <b>gradients</b> that deviate the particle from the streamline followed if it is suspended in an inelastic fluid. The shear rate gradients are enhanced whether both the confinement ratio and the flow rate increase.

50|$|Unlike {{a copper}} wire, the current density of a current {{carrying}} disc is not uniform across its cross-sectional area, but is instead {{a function of}} the ratio of the inner diameter of the disc to an arbitrary radius within the disc. The implications of this relationship is that the current density decreases with an increase in radius. As such, the bulk of the current is flowing closer to the inner radius of the disc. Large discs (i.e. disc with a large difference between their inner and outer radius) will have a larger discrepancy in the current density between the inner and outer portions of the disc. This will reduce the efficiency and cause additional complications in the system because there will be a more substantial temperature and <b>stress</b> <b>gradient</b> along the disc. As such, a series of nested coils is often used as it will more evenly distribute the current across a large combined area as opposed to a single coil with large discs.|$|E
50|$|The laser peening process {{originated}} with high energy, Nd-glass lasers producing pulse energies up to 50 J (more commonly 5 to 40 J) with pulse durations of 8 to 25 ns. Laser spot diameters on target are typically {{in the range}} of 2 to 7 mm. The processing sequence begins by applying the opaque overlay on the workpiece or target surface. Commonly used opaque overlay materials are black or aluminum tape, paint or a proprietary liquid, RapidCoaterTM. The tape or paint is generally applied over the entire area to be processed, while the RapidCoaterTM is applied over each laser spot just before triggering the laser pulse. After application of the opaque overlay, the transparent overlay is placed over it. The transparent overlay used in production processing is water; it is cheap, easily applied, readily conforms to most complex surface geometries and is easily removed. It is applied to the surface just before triggering the laser pulse. Quartz or glass overlays produce much higher pressures than water, but are limited to flat surfaces, must be replaced after each shot and would be difficult to handle in a production setting. Clear tape may be used, but requires labor to apply and is difficult to conform to complex surface features. The transparent overlay allows the laser beam to pass through it without appreciable absorption of the laser energy or dielectric breakdown. When the laser is triggered, the beam passes through the transparent overlay and strikes the opaque overlay, immediately vaporizing a thin layer of the overlay material. This vapor is trapped in the interface between the transparent and opaque overlays. The continued delivery of energy during the laser pulse rapidly heats and ionizes the vapor, converting it into a rapidly expanding plasma. The rising pressure exerted on the opaque overlay surface by the expanding plasma enters the target surface as a high amplitude stress wave or shock wave. Without a transparent overlay, the unconfined plasma plume moves away from the surface and the peak pressure is considerably lower. If the amplitude of the shock wave is above the Hugoniot Elastic Limit (HEL), i.e., the dynamic yield strength, of the target, the material plastically deforms during passage of the shock wave. The magnitude of the plastic strain decreases with distance from the surface as the peak pressure of the shock wave attenuates, i.e., decreases, and becomes zero when the peak pressure falls below the HEL. After the shock wave passes, the residual plastic strain creates a compressive residual <b>stress</b> <b>gradient</b> below the target surface, highest at or immediately below the surface and decreasing with depth. By varying the laser power density, pulse duration, and number of successive shots on an area, a range of surface compressive stress magnitudes and depths can be achieved. The magnitude of surface stresses are comparable to shot peening, but the depths are much greater, ranging up to 5 mm when using multiple shots on a spot. Generally spot densities of about 10 spots/cm2 to 40 spots/cm2 are applied. The compressive stress depth achieved with the most common processing parameters ranges from 1 to 2 mm deep. The deep compressive stresses are due to the shock wave peak pressure being maintained above the HEL to greater depths than for other peening technologies.|$|E
5000|$|For current {{metallization}} {{technologies for}} high-performance and low-power microelectronics, Cu is {{the material of}} choice due to its higher electromigration (EM) stability (resulting from the higher melting point) and conductivity to aluminium. For downscaled logic and memory applications up to 14 nm node the increased current density and reliability requirements per interconnect line still have known material and integration solutions. Thinner barrier and adhesion layers, doping of secondary metals to enhance grain boundary electromigration resistance, and integration concepts of selective cappings will {{be some of the}} adopted solutions. However, for dimensions below 7 to 10 nm nodes, the decreased volume of available conducting metal will force innovative material and integration approaches towards novel interconnect architectures. Also for power and high-performance applications the most critical challenges are high ampacity, thermal conductivity and electromigration resistance. Far away from bulk, Cu conductors that would already melt at 104 A/cm2, current Cu metallization lines can withstand 107 A/cm2 due to good heat dissipation into thermal contact to the surrounding material, optimized liner and capping as well as plating and CMP processes. The reliability of state of the art interconnects is closely linked to electromigration [...] This adverse effect describes the material transport and consequently void formation especially in thin metal lines to the anode by a combination of the electron wind force, the temperature gradient induced force, the <b>stress</b> <b>gradient</b> induced force and the surface tension force. Depending on the design of the interconnect layout and the used metallization scheme, the dominance of each driving force can change. Even at the current scaling node of CMOS technology, these two issues are among the main reasons for the trend that the increased density scaling of transistors no longer automatically leads to [...] "performance scaling" [...] (i. e. increased performance per transistor). CNTs are being studied as a potential Cu replacement owing to their excellent electrical properties in terms of conductivity, ampacity and high frequency characteristics. However, the performances of CNTs integrated into functional devices are so far systematically much lower than those of nearly perfect CNTs selected for fundamental studies worldwide. As a consequence, combinations of CNTs with copper were envisioned soon after the pioneering study about CNT interconnects. Initial experimental realizations focused on a [...] "bulk" [...] approach where a mixture of CNTs and Cu is deposited from a solution on the target substrate. This approach demonstrated mitigated performances for interconnect, such that focus is now almost exclusively on composite materials where the CNTs are aligned with respect to the current flow (referred to as aligned CNT-Cu composite). Furthermore, contact resistance, mechanical stability, planarity and integration could be improved by a supporting conductive matrix.Chai et al. first demonstrated the fabrication of vertical interconnects using aligned CNT-Cu composite materials in 2007 by first growing vertically aligned CNTs before filling the voids between CNTs with Cu through an electroplating method. It was shown that this material could reach low, Cu-like, resistivity but was more resistant to electromigration than Cu. More recently, a renewed interest for this material was generated by the work of Hata group [...] claiming a 100 fold increase in current carrying capacity of aligned CNT-Cu material compared to pure Cu. Several groups are now working worldwide on the integration of aligned CNT-Cu composite materials in interconnect structures, Present and near-future efforts are focusing on demonstrating and evaluating the performances of aligned CNT-Cu composite materials for both vertical and horizontal interconnects, and to develop a CMOS-compatible process flow for multilevel global interconnects.|$|E

This study computes the spatial values of wall shear <b>stresses</b> and their <b>gradients</b> for three carotid artery bifurcation geometries. Methods: A computational fluid dynamics program was used to solve the transient two-dimensional partial differential equations that describe fluid flow. Blood was treated as both a Newtonian and a non-Newtonian incompressible fluid. Solutions for the velocities, wall shear stresses, and wall shear-stress gradients were obtained for three carotid bifurcation geometries: a normal carotid bifurcation (similar to a primarily carotid bifurcation geometries: a normal carotid bifurcation (similar to a primarily reconstructed carotid endarterectomy), a patch-reconstructed carotid endarterectomy, and a gradually tapered, low-angle carotid bifurcation (no carotid bulb). Results: Computed velocity profiles closely match published experimental ones. Disturbed flow velocities are largest in the bulb segment of the normal carotid bifurcation. Peak and minimum wall shear stresses and peak shear <b>stress</b> <b>gradients</b> occurred in the lateral internal carotid artery wall. These were binodal in the normal or primarily reconstructed carotid artery, localized at the distal end of the patch-reconstructed carotid bifurcation, and minimal in the smooth, tapered carotid bifurcation.

Conclusion: These results indicate that flow disturbances in general and wall shear <b>stress</b> <b>gradients</b> in particular are markedly reduced in carotid artery bifurcations that are smooth and gradually tapered and do not have a bulb.

Finite-element beam models were built to compute the deflection induced by the <b>stress</b> <b>gradient.</b> Matching the deflection computed under a given gradient with that measured experimentally on fabricated samples allows the <b>stress</b> <b>gradient</b> of the PECVD silicon nitride thin films introduced from the fabrication process to be evaluated...|$|E
40|$|The paper investigates {{gradient}} effects, which {{relate to}} how highly stressed regions should {{be dealt with}} in fatigue design analyses. In particular <b>stress</b> <b>gradients</b> in rolling contact are investigated with a focus on differences in response between full and partial slip conditions. To this end the multiaxial state of stress beneath a wheel–rail contact featuring full or partial slip is quantified using a multiaxial equivalent stress criterion. A comparative study shows that the significant differences in peak interfacial shear stress magnitudes between full and partial slip conditions are significantly reduced when translated to equivalent stress magnitudes. An innovative procedure to quantify the gradient effects by comparing the multiaxial contact stress field to uniaxial conditions is developed and employed. For the studied cases <b>stress</b> <b>gradients</b> beneath the frictional contact were found to be similar to <b>stress</b> <b>gradients</b> outside a uniaxially loaded large plate featuring a small hole with a radius in the order of 0. 5 – 0. 7  mm. The study concludes that the use of local magnitudes of interfacial shear stress in the analysis of surface initiated rolling contact fatigue under partial slip conditions is conservative. The analysis framework established in the current study can be used to estimate the level of conservativeness...|$|R

40|$|Antireflective {{coatings}} on polymer substrates {{as required}} for ophthalmic lenses and transparent display windows have to fulfill challenging requirements concerning their environmental stability. The mismatch of thermal properties of polymers and inorganic coatings causes stresses that {{may reduce the}} durability and dimensional stability of coated polymers. This study shows that ex-situ measurements of stresses have to be executed on polymer substrates rather than on inorganic substrates to record the residual film stress. Additionally, a concept of an elastic multilayer is applied to calculate <b>stress</b> <b>gradients</b> inside of single films and antireflective coatings {{during and after the}} deposition process on polymer substrates. For the development of coated polymer optics of high-stability it is essential {{to take into account the}} <b>stress</b> <b>gradients</b> across the coatings, and to apply special coating designs and optimized coating deposition parameters...|$|R
