40|$|This profile {{provides}} a brief {{introduction to the}} yeast production industry with particular emphasis on the production of baker's yeast. Yeast can be obtained either as the primary product of a process, {{as in the case}} of baker's yeast, or as a secondary or by-product from alcoholic fermentations. Secondary yeast is usually preferred to primary yeast for use as animal feed for reasons of economy. Carbohydrates in the form of molasses or hydrolysed starches are the most commonly used substrates for yeast growth. Carbohydrate-containing waste streams from other processes and n-paraffins from oil have also been exploited for the production of feed yeast. Processes for the production of primary yeast vary but basically consist of materials preparation, <b>seed</b> <b>yeast</b> production, fermentation, yeast separation and pressing or drying steps, depending on the type of yeast required. About half a million tonnes are thought to be produced annually, slightly under half as baker's yeast. The size of plant can vary from half a tonne per day upwards. Plants have been built for n-paraffin feed yeast with capacities of 100, 000 tonnes per year. The cost of a basic plant to produce 7. 5 tonnes of active dried baker's yeast (10 % moisture) per day would be about £ 3. 5 million f. o. b. UK in July 1980. Additional plant, necessary in many locations, would increase the cost. Yeast plants are not labour intensive; this scale of operation would provide 21 - 24 jobs.

Introduction: Yeast {{is one of}} {{the most}} interesting substances used in the household, and one that is usually but little understood. The knowledge resulting from even a superficial study will more than repay the effort by a gain in uniformity of results following its use. The yeast plant {{is one of the}} simplest forms of vegetable life, consisting of a single cell microscopic in size. It belongs to the class of fungi and feeds only upon organic material. Under certain conditions unfavorable to the best development of the plant it Col= spores which are fitted to withstand drying and live for some time in a quiescent state. These spores are widely distributed, being found in the surface of the Ground, and for two or three inches beneath the surface as well as on nearly all fruits and vegetables. Many varieties of yeast have been studied and described but only two or three are cultivated. The yeast plant has been most carefully studied with respect to its power in producing alcohol, in breweries and distilleries. And much of the compressed yeast on the market is a by-product of such plants. There are, however, large establishments which make compressed yeast their principal product. In the process of manufacturing compressed yeast the grain is carefully selected and washed. After crushing a part of it is flowed to sprout, forming malt. Lactic acid is also allowed to form as a small amount of this acid serves as a protection against bacterial growth. To the entire amount of grain an abundance of eater is added as the yeast requires a liquid medium for its best development.

Below the apparent transition, viable pollen shows low germination and high leakage when placed in water, but above the transition germination increases and leakage decreases. The apparent transition temperature falls with increasing water content, much as in pure phospholipids.

The pathogen {{is a member}} of the C. acutatum species complex, and contrasts with other members of the latter by its host specificity and by its apparent low genetic variability. Primary seed infections as low as 0. 01 - 0. 1 % can cause very severe infections. Under this conditions, one the most effective management strategies is the development of a robust and sensitive seed detection assay to screen seed lots before planting. PCR-based detection systems exhibit higher levels of sensitivity than conventional techniques but when applied to seed tests they require the extraction of PCRquality DNA from target organisms in backgrounds of saprophytic organisms and inhibitory seed-derived compounds. To overcome these limitations a new detection protocol for C. lupini based on a biological enrichment step followed by a PCR assay was developed.

Due to their special properties, {{they have many}} {{applications}} such as lubricants, cosmetics, pharmaceutical products, ink, polishes and candles. They are also considered as potential biofuels and biolubricants in the future. Wax ester producing enzymes synthesize wax esters from alcohols and fatty acyl coenzyme A thioesters. There are three gene families encoding enzymes capable of synthesizing wax esters. Two of them exist in plans; the jojoba-like wax synthase (WS), and the bifunctional wax synthase/diacylglycerol acyl transferase (WS/DGAT). We investigated the phylogenetic relationships among and between WS and WS/DGAT, based upon primary sequence homology of the encoded proteins. Nine candidate genes were chosen for experimental characterization in <b>yeast</b> and Arabidopsis <b>seed.</b> In <b>yeast</b> heterologous expression system, three of the expressed gene products were detected immunologically, Arabidopsis WS At 5 g 55340, a maize WS and a moss WS. Moreover, by feeding these transgenic yeast strains with potential fatty acid and fatty alcohol substrates, we demonstrated that At 5 g 55340 and the maize WS were expressed in a functional state, and could direct the synthesis of novel ester lipids. Based upon the ability to form different esters from different precursors, {{we were able to}} deduce the substrate preferences of these two enzymes. These characterizations indicate that At 5 g 55340 -encoded WS has a rather narrow substrate preference, producing esters with linear fatty acids and fatty alcohols of about equal chain length. In contrast the maize WS has a wider substrate preference, producing similar linear esters as At 5 g 55340, but also benzyl and ethyl esters. These candidate genes were also expressed in seeds of Arabidopsis Col- 0. These transgenic events were coupled with the co-expression of the jojoba 3 -ketoacyl-CoA synthase (KCS) and the jojoba fatty acid reductase (FAR). All three transgenes were {{under the control of the}} regulatory sequence of the seed-specific Glycinin promoter. The presence of mRNA of these transformed cDNAs was confirmed by RT-PCR. Gas chromatographic analysis of transgenic seeds indicated that jojoba KCS and FAR generated a substrate pool that contains very long chain fatty acids and long chain primary fatty alcohols. The Arabidopsis transgenic line ectopically expressing the At 5 g 55380 WS produced wax esters in the seed oil.

Differential attractiveness experiments and the isolation of yeasts consumed by Drosophila may be informative for characterizing this association. Hanseniaspora uvarum {{is among the most}} common yeast species isolated from Drosophila crops, with high attractiveness to drosophilids. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been widely used to collect flies, and it allows broad sampling of almost all local Drosophila species. Pronounced differences in the field concerning Drosophila attractivity to baits <b>seeded</b> with these <b>yeast</b> species have been previously reported. However, few explicit generalizations have been set. Since late fifties, no field experiments of Drosophila attractivity were carried out in the Neotropical region, which is facing shifts in abiotic and biotic factors. Our objective is to characterize preference behavior that mediates the interaction in the wild among Neotropical Drosophila species and yeasts associated with them. We want to set a broad generalization about drosophilids attracted to these yeasts. Here we present the results of a differential attractiveness experiment we carried out in a natural Atlantic Rainforest fragment to assess the preferences of Drosophila species groups to baits inoculated with H. uvarum and S. cerevisiae. Methods Both yeast species were cultured in GYMP broth and separately poured in autoclaved mashed banana that was left fermenting. In the field, we collected drosophilids over five arrays of three different baits: non-inoculated autoclaved banana and banana inoculated with each yeast. In the laboratory the drosophilids were sorted to five sets according to their external morphology and/or genitalia: tripunctata; guarani; willistoni; exotic; and the remaining flies pooled in others. Results and Conclusions Uninoculated banana baits attracted virtually no flies. We found significant departures from random distribution over the other two baits (1 : 1 proportion) for all sets, except the pooled others. Flies of the sets willistoni and exotic preferred H. uvarum over S. cerevisiae, while the remaining sets were more attracted to S. cerevisiae. Previously, various authors reported similar patterns in attraction experiments with S. cerevisiae and H. uvarum. It is also noteworthy that both yeast species have been isolated from natural substrates and crops of Drosophila species. Taken together, these results suggest that the preferences among Drosophila species groups may be reflecting deep and stable relations with yeast species in natural environments. They can be summarized as: forest dwelling species from subgenus Drosophila (such as tripunctata and guarani groups) are attracted to banana baits seeded with S. cerevisiae; while exotic (as D. melanogaster) and subgenus Sophophora species are preferentially attracted to baits seeded with H. uvarum...|$|R
