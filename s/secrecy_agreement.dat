40|$|My thesis {{analyzes}} {{the process of}} licensing university inventions by start-up and established firms. In particular, the licensing procedure {{involves the use of}} secrecies, which are confidential agreements used by firms to learn about the quality of invention. My first two chapters of the thesis describe the quality characteristics of the <b>secrecy</b> <b>agreements</b> and analyze the efficiency implications of the secrecy device. In my last chapter, I describe the differences in licensing behavior between start-up and established firms with respect to the invention's stages of development. I use a unique data set based on licensing activity at University of California, San Diego. I match this data set with the grant data obtained from the Office of Contracts and Grant, UCSD for the period 1986 - 2003. I find that <b>secrecy</b> <b>agreements</b> can be used by firms as a contemporaneous measure of invention's quality, in their licensing decision. In addition, the secrecy device enhances weakly the efficiency of the licensing secrecy and the gains in welfare are proportional with the difference in production cost of established firm and the inventor. In my last chapter I find that the odds ratio of licensing by start- ups relative to licensing by established firms is lower for more advanced stage inventions. This result can be used to analyze other complex issues regarding the licensing process, like efficiency and the role of asymmetric information in start-up formatio...|$|R
50|$|A {{non-disclosure}} agreement (NDA), {{also known as}} a confidentiality agreement (CA), confidential disclosure agreement (CDA), proprietary information agreement (PIA) or <b>secrecy</b> <b>agreement</b> (SA), is a legal contract between at least two parties that outlines confidential material, knowledge, or information that the parties wish to share with one another for certain purposes, but wish to restrict access to or by third parties. It is a contract through which the parties agree not to disclose information covered by the agreement. An NDA creates a confidential relationship between the parties to protect any type of confidential and proprietary information or trade secrets. As such, an NDA protects non-public business information.|$|E

Phillips, who owned a small English‑language newspaper in Santiago, Chile, when he was recruited by the CIA in 1950, described the approach: “Somebody from the Agency says, ‘I want you to help me.

50|$|After {{spending}} time in Lake Charles, Helfand and her team travel to Venice, Italy, where they meet more citizens hurt by large vinyl productions plants. The problem, they discover, is a worldwide issue. Helfand meets and interviews Dr. Caesar Maltone, a biologist whose experiments helped to create the basis {{for most of the}} lawsuits against vinyl production plants around the world. The documentary reveals that a few large vinyl production companies signed a <b>secrecy</b> <b>agreement</b> to make sure Maltone's findings stay secret {{from the rest of the}} world. The documentary focuses mainly on the Italian company EniChem, which is located in Venice and was the focus of Maltone's study. But, the vinyl producers do set certain rules and regulations on vinyl productions plants to try and avoid excessive lawsuits. For example, they declare that the limit of exposure that any given worker will have in the process of vinyl production is 1 ppm (part per million). But, after Helfand consults with Maltone again, he reveals that no limits that companies put can fully prevent exposure when production happens.|$|E

In it, Scheuer explores the bin Laden phenomenon and its implications for U.S. security. He began the book in 1999 as an unclassified manual for counterterrorism officers. Due to the <b>secrecy</b> <b>agreement</b> he signed as an employee of the CIA, the book is based solely on unclassified intelligence or material available from open sources such as media reports. His main thesis in the work is that the view of bin Laden as a lunatic is a form of [...] "myopia" [...] that limits Western military thinkers' ability to respond to the bin Laden phenomenon. He writes that [...] "the West's road to hell lies in approaching the bin Laden problem with the presumption that only the lunatic fringe could oppose what the United States is trying to accomplish through its foreign policy toward the Muslim world. Bin Laden's philosophy is slowly harnessing the two most powerful motivating forces in contemporary international affairs: religion and nationalism." ...|$|E
40|$|PLATO is {{a project}} for a future space mission that is {{intended}} to be submitted in response to the upcoming ESA ”Cosmic Vision ” announcement of opportunity. The science goal of PLATO is to provide a solid observational basis to understand the formation and evolution of stars and their planetary systems. This goal will be achieved by determining statistically the distribution of sizes and orbits of exoplanets, down to sub-earth sized planets and up to orbits at several AU, and the properties of their parent stars through asteroseismology. The observational concept of PLATO is based on ultra-high precision photometry from space. The strategy is to identify a sample of more than 100 000 bright stars, and to perform on all of them a long-term high precision monitoring in white-light visible photometry. This monitoring will be used on one hand to search for and characterize planetary transits in front of these stars, {{and on the other hand}} to detect and analyse oscillations of the same stars and thus probe their internal structure and dynamics. The requirements for such a mission are challenging: a very wide field-of-view, near 900 square degrees, as well as a large effective collecting area, of the order of 1 m 2, are necessary to monitor simultaneously a sufficiently large sample of bright stars, with a sufficient photometric precision. The duration of the monitoring must be of at least 5 years. We present an example of instrumental concept compliant with these requirements. It involves a large number of small pupil optics, each one illuminating its own large format focal plane. Although challenging, this concept builds on heritage from previous missions and previous studies, and presents a low technological risk. Detailed industrial studies of the proposed mission are currently being undertaken by Astrium and by Alcatel/Alenia, and the final form of the mission concept to be submitted to ESA will doubtless draw heavily on these studies. Due to <b>secrecy</b> <b>agreements</b> with these companies we are not permitted, at this time, to discuss the current stage of their studies...|$|R

The decision to enter a <b>secrecy</b> <b>agreement</b> is determined by the uncertainty about the underlying quality of inventions.
