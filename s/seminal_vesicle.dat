5|$|For males, the {{reproductive}} {{system is the}} testis, suspended in the body cavity by tracheae and the fat body. Most male insects have a pair of testes, inside of which are sperm tubes or follicles that are enclosed within a membranous sac. The follicles connect to the vas deferens by the vas efferens, and the two tubular vasa deferentia connect to a median ejaculatory duct {{that leads to the}} outside. A portion of the vas deferens is often enlarged to form the <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle,</b> which stores the sperm before they are discharged into the female. The seminal vesicles have glandular linings that secrete nutrients for nourishment and maintenance of the sperm. The ejaculatory duct is derived from an invagination of the epidermal cells during development and, as a result, has a cuticular lining. The terminal portion of the ejaculatory duct may be sclerotized to form the intromittent organ, the aedeagus. The remainder of the male reproductive system is derived from embryonic mesoderm, except for the germ cells, or spermatogonia, which descend from the primordial pole cells very early during embryogenesis.|$|E

25|$|The {{function}} of the prostate is to secrete a slightly alkaline fluid, milky or white in appearance, that in humans usually constitutes roughly 30% {{of the volume of}} the semen along with spermatozoa and <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> fluid. Semen is made alkaline overall with the secretions from the other contributing glands, including, at least, the <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> fluid. The alkalinity of semen helps neutralize the acidity of the vaginal tract, prolonging the lifespan of sperm. The prostatic fluid is expelled in the first ejaculate fractions, together with most of the spermatozoa. In comparison with the few spermatozoa expelled together with mainly seminal vesicular fluid, those expelled in prostatic fluid have better motility, longer survival and better protection of the genetic material.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Amyloidosis is a {{rare disease}} with various etiologies with {{extracellular}} amyloid protein depositions. At present, at least 26 distinctive amyloid forms have been detected with different clinical importance and treatment. They have characteristic staning fetaures with Congo red. Amyloid may be detected in 2 - 10 % of prostates that have been removed because of hyperplasia or carcinoma. Amyloidosis of <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicles</b> is accepted as senil amyloidosis {{and it is not}} accompanied by systemic amyloidosis or clinical symptoms. This condition is {{the most common form of}} localized amyloidosis. In this study we aimed to investigate incidence and histologic characteristics of amyloidosis of <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicles</b> in radical prostatectomy materials of the patients whose prostate carcinomas were treated surgically. Material and Method: Amyloid depositions in <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicles</b> of 207 radical prostatectomy materials that prostates had been removed due to localized prostate carcinoma. Amyloid depositions were confirmed with Congo red staining and polarization microscope. Results: Amyloidosis of <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicles</b> was detected in 10 (4. 8 %) of cases. Mean age of the patients is 66. 2 years. Amyloid depositions tend to be nodular and bilateral in subepithelial region of affected <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicles.</b> Amyloid depositions were not detected in blood vessels in <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicles</b> or prostate parenchyma.

40|$|Enlargement of <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicles</b> in C 57 BL/ 6 J male mice occurs spontaneously in a {{subpopulation}} of mice aged 24 mo. or older. The enlargement is {{bilateral and}} results entirely from an increased mass of seminal fluid. Glandular hypoplasia {{is indicated by}} histological studies and DNA content. Thus, the enlargement of <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicles</b> differs from the phenomenon of benign hypertrophy of the prostate, which is commonly found in the corresponding age group of dogs and man. <b>SEMINAL</b> <b>vesicles</b> are convoluted diverticula(Fig. 1) arising from each ductus deferens, which secrete a viscous, milky, fructose-rich fluid during ejaculation through the ejacula-tory ducts.

25|$|The {{occurrence}} of seminal vesicles, {{in spite of}} their interspecific variability in size, gross morphology and function, has not been related to the mode of fertilization. They are typically paired, multi-chambered, and connected with the sperm duct, and have been reported to play a glandular and a storage function. <b>Seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> secretion may include steroids and steroid glucuronides, with hormonal and pheromonal functions, but it appears to be primarily constituted of mucoproteins, acid mucopolysaccharides, and phospholipids.|$|E
25|$|In {{the male}} the duct persists, and forms the tube of the epididymis, the ductus deferens and the {{ejaculatory}} duct, while the <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle</b> arises {{during the third}} month as a lateral diverticulum from its hinder end. A {{large part of the}} head end of the mesonephros atrophies and disappears; of the remainder the anterior tubules form the efferent ducts of the testis; while the posterior tubules are represented by the ductuli aberrantes, and by the paradidymis, which is sometimes found in front of the spermatic cord above the head of the epididymis.|$|E
25|$|Internally, {{the sexes}} of most marine animals can be {{determined}} {{by looking at the}} gonads.

Male lampreys, hagfish and salmon discharge their sperm into the body cavity where it is expelled through pores in the abdomen. Male sharks and rays can pass sperm along a duct into a <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle,</b> where they store it for a while before it is expelled, while teleosts usually employ separate sperm ducts.|$|E

60|$|Section 16. The uro-genital {{organs of}} the frog, and {{especially}} those of the male, correspond with embryonic stages of the rabbit. In this sex the testes (T., Sheet 13) lie in the body cavity, and are white bodies usually dappled with black pigment. Vasa efferentia (v.e.) run to the internal border of the anterior part of the kidney, which answers, therefore, to the rabbit's epididymis. The hinder part of the kidney is the predominant renal organ. There is a common uro-genital duct, into which a <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicle,</b> which is especially large in early spring, opens. This is the permanent condition of the frog. In the rabbit, for urogenital duct, we have ureter and vas deferens; the testes and that anterior part of the primitive kidney, the epididymis, shift back into the scrotal sacs, and the ureters shift round the rectum and establish a direct connection with the bladder, carrying the genital ducts looped over them. The oviducts of the female do not fuse distally to form a median vagina {{as they do in}} the rabbit. In front of the genital organ in both sexes is a corpus adiposum (c.ad.), which acts as a fat store, and is peculiar to the frogs and toads. The distal end of the oviduct of the female is in the breeding season (early March) enormously distended with ova, and the ovaries become then the mere vestiges of their former selves. The distal end of the oviduct is, therefore, not unfrequently styled the uterus. There is no penis in the male, fertilisation of the ova occurring as they are squeezed out of the female by the embracing fore limbs of the male. The male has a pad, black in winter, shown in Figure 1, which is closely pressed against the ventral surface of the female in copulation, and which serves as a ready means of distinguishing the sex.|$|E

No specific 3 H-muscimol binding occurred in the epididymis. 3 H-muscimol was bound to sections of <b>seminal</b> <b>vesicles</b> and prostate glands {{in a manner consistent with}} the labeling of specific GABAA receptors.
