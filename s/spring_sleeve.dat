40|$|A {{compact and}} aesthetically-pleasing {{self-closing}} door hinge comprises a gravity-assist feature and preferably a springassist feature, wherein the spring may be easily adjustable, replaceable, and even {{left out of}} the hinge. The preferred embodiment is reversible for easily changing from a rightopening to a left-opening door, and includes hinge lift-off capability, wherein the door and the blade connecting the door to the hinge body may be lifted up off the body of the hinge without any significant disassembly of the hinge. The spring is preferably placed aronnd the gravity-assist cams of the hinge, rather than above or below the cams, which arrangement significantly reduces the overall height of the hinge with only slightly increased diameter of the hinge main body. The preferred hinge has no bolts or other fasteners visible or protruding out from the main housing of the hinge, and the preferred hinge has no exposed <b>spring</b> <b>sleeve...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduced}} {{a kind of}} fast tool servo (FTS) that its stiffness is adjustable. Based on in the frame rack, flexible hinge, piezoelectric ceramic driver, tool base, diamond tools and so on, a spring assembly appendixes on. The spring assembly is consisting of <b>spring</b> rack, the <b>sleeve,</b> <b>spring,</b> and lock circle etc. Spring rack is fixed {{in front of the}} frame rack; there is a screw hole {{in the middle of the}} spring rack; there is also a screw outer side of the sleeve that mounted through the screw hole. The spring is installed inside sleeve; one end of the spring contacts with the bottom of the sleeve, and the other end contacts with the flexible hinge on frame rack. It can adjust the force of the spring that presses to the flexible hinge by rotating the sleeve. Through replaced the spring, it can makes stiffness of the FTS changed. It is verified that the device has the stiffness adjustable function through calculation and simulation...|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} effecting the {{in-flight}} departure of an astronaut from a shuttle craft, and apparatus is presented. A plurality of removeable compartment covers are provided, behind which rocket assemblies are stowed. To actuate the system, the astronaut pulls off a tab {{from one of}} the compartments which exposes a cannister having a lanyard with a hook. The lanyard extends around a <b>spring</b> biased <b>sleeve</b> with a safety lever preventing rocket ignition until the hook is moved by the astronaut. Upward movement of the hook allows the trigger mechanism to actuate the system resulting in the rods projecting out of the hatch. When the lanyard becomes taut, a lanyard elongation detector transmits a signal to the firing mechanisms to fire the rocket...|$|R
50|$|Most {{downhole}} {{safety valves}} are controlled hydraulically from the surface, meaning they are opened using a hydraulic connection linked {{directly to a}} well control panel. When hydraulic pressure is applied down a control line, the hydraulic pressure forces a sleeve within the valve to slide downwards. This movement compresses a large spring and pushes the flapper downwards to open the valve. When hydraulic pressure is removed, the <b>spring</b> pushes the <b>sleeve</b> back up and causes the flapper to shut. In this way, it is failsafe and will isolate the wellbore {{in the event of}} a loss of the wellhead. The full designation for a typical valve is 'tubing retrievable, surface controlled, subsurface safety valve', abbreviated to TR-SCSSV.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{three-dimensional}} mechanical {{model and}} a transcalent model of flange bolt joint were built, considering the nonlinearity of gasket and the contact problem, {{the effect of}} inhomogeneous temperature field and its variation to pressure of bolt and gasket was studied, and the joint parameters of two schemes were compared; based on the orthogonal text, two bolt system schemes, adding disc <b>spring</b> and adding <b>sleeve,</b> were experimentally studied. The investigation showed that the sealability of {{different parts of the}} gaskets is different, owing to the difference of each bolt in radial and axial displacement under the influence of inhomogeneous temperature field, and the fatigue of gasket and bolt is easily caused; the scheme of disc spring is better than sleeve, and the disc spring, whose thickness is 0. 9 mm, was selected to improve the mechanical performance of bolt system...|$|R
40|$|The {{tensioning}} device {{is designed to}} pull the contact wire straight at all times. Pulling a contact wire straight ensures that smooth contact is maintained at all times between the contact wire and pantograph of an electric train, and this {{makes it possible to}} ensure a stable supply of electricity to the train. Normally, {{tensioning device}} are installed at two positions over a distance of 1 to 1. 6 km per line. Fig. 1 shows a conceptual view {{of the relationship between the}} contact wire and pulley type balancer. The tensioning device can be broadly classified into the two types; the wheel type tensioning device that pulls the contact wire by concrete or iron weights and the spring type tensioning device that use the force of a spring to pull it. Fig. 2 shows the wheel type balancer, while Fig. 3 represents the spring type balancer. The spring type tensioning device comprises a <b>spring</b> and a <b>sleeve</b> for accommodating the <b>spring.</b> Only the <b>sleeve</b> portion is visible to the outside. The wheel depends on gravity acting on the weight to produce tension, so it is possible to pull the contact wire at an almost uniform force, regardless of the height of the weight. In the spring type The wheel type tensioning device used in the Tohoku and Joetsu Shinkansen lines of JR East requires much time and labor for maintenance including wire replacement and oil application. Further, parts become superannuated and in need of periodic replacement very quickly. So we found it necessary to develop a new type of maintenance-free tensioning device. To accomplish this, we have been making efforts since 1999 to develop a new spring type tensioning device for Shinkansen, making effective use of the spring type balancer technologies used in the narrow gauge lines, where the major target is to develop a maintenance-free tensioning device. Thus, fairly satisfactory development results have been attained. This paper introduces and discusses this development...|$|R
