5|$|In July 1940, Graf Zeppelin was towed from Kiel to Gotenhafen (Gdynia) and {{remained}} there {{for nearly a}} year. While there, she {{was used as a}} <b>storage</b> <b>depot</b> for Germany's hardwood supply. Just before Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, the carrier was again moved, this time to Stettin, to safeguard her from Soviet air attacks. By November, the German army had pushed deep enough into Russian territory to remove any further threat of air attack and Graf Zeppelin was returned to Gotenhafen. There, she was used as a store ship for timber.|$|E
5|$|In 1793, {{following}} {{a survey of}} coastal defences in the southeast, approval was given for the positioning of infantry and artillery to defend the bay between Beachy Head and Hastings from attack by the French. Fourteen Martello Towers were constructed along the western shore of Pevensey Bay, continuing as far as Tower73, the Wish Tower at Eastbourne. Several of these towers survive: the Wish Tower is an important feature of the town's seafront and {{was the subject of}} a painting by James Sant RA, and part of Tower68 forms the basement of a house on St.Antony's Hill. Between 1805 and 1807, the construction took place of a fortress known as the Eastbourne Redoubt, which was built as a barracks and <b>storage</b> <b>depot,</b> and armed with 10cannons.|$|E

Croatian forces also captured the Žrnovnica missile base and JNA weapons storage facilities near Daruvar, Otočac, Križevci and Virovitica. On 17 September, Croatian forces captured the JNA barracks in Daruvar, Ogulin, Čakovec, Križevci, Virovitica, Požega, two JNA barracks in the Šibenik–Rogoznica area {{and one in}} Varaždin. A JNA depot was captured near Zagreb (Duboki Jarak). On 18 September, three additional barracks in Varaždin, one near Rogoznica and two in Đakovotogether with all remaining JNA facilities in Gospić, a nearby weapons storage facility, a communications facility near Garešnica and dozens of border postssurrendered to Croatian forces.|$|E
5|$|On 19 September, the ZNG {{clashed with}} the JNA {{garrison}} at the Logorište barracks in Karlovac, captured a communications facility at Platak near Rijeka an additional JNA barracks and a <b>storage</b> <b>depot</b> in Varaždin, restricting the JNA to the barracks housing headquarters of the JNA Varaždin Corps. By 20 September, when the JNA launched a campaign against the ZNG throughout Croatia, more than 60 JNA facilities in Croatiaincluding 15 barracks and 11 storage depotshad surrendered or were captured. The JNA barracks in Našice surrendered on 21 September. The JNA Varaždin Corps surrendered the next day, providing the ZNG with a major caché of weapons. In {{the first few days}} of the blockade, the Croatian forces also captured several small JNA posts in Split, but no large JNA facility in the city.|$|E
5|$|From 1997 to 2009 {{the main}} {{collection}} was housed in this single new {{building and the}} collection of British and overseas newspapers was housed at Colindale. In July 2008 the Library {{announced that it would}} be moving low-use items to a new storage facility in Boston Spa in Yorkshire and that it planned to close the newspaper library at Colindale, ahead of a later move to a similar facility on the same site. From January 2009 to April 2012 over 200km of material was moved to the Additional Storage Building and is now delivered to British Library Reading Rooms in London on request by a daily shuttle service. Construction work on the Newspaper Storage Building was completed in 2013 and the newspaper library at Colindale closed on 8 November 2013. The collection has now been split between the St Pancras and Boston Spa sites. The British Library Document Supply Service (BLDSS) and the Library's Document Supply Collection is based on the same site in Boston Spa. Collections housed in Yorkshire, comprising low-use material and the newspaper and Document Supply collections, make up around 70% of the total material the library holds. The Library previously had a book <b>storage</b> <b>depot</b> in Woolwich, south-east London, which is no longer in use.|$|E

5|$|Prime Minister Franjo Gregurić {{proposed}} Tuđman {{to implement}} Špegelj's plan. According to General Anton Tus, Tuđman ordered the ZNG to capture JNA barracks on 12 September, but rescinded the order the next day. The order was reinstated on 14 September after Tus pleaded with Tuđman {{to authorize the}} move, arguing that the ZNG {{was running out of}} time. The same day, the ZNG and the Croatian police blockaded and cut utilities to all JNA facilities it had access to, beginning the Battle of the Barracks. The move blockaded 33 large JNA garrisons in Croatia, and numerous smaller facilities, including border posts and weapons and ammunition storage depots. The blockade forced the JNA to amend its campaign in Croatia plans to accommodate the new development. Several JNA posts were attacked by the ZNG before the blockade was officially sanctioned, largely in response to local battlefield situations. The first such incident was a failed attack on JNA barracks in Sinj on 25 August, in response to the deterioration of ZNG positions in the nearby village of Kijevo. On 3 September, the ZNG captured a barracks in Sisak, and on 13 September a weapons <b>storage</b> <b>depot</b> in Gospić area was captured amid fighting for control of the city. In May, 21 M-84AB tanks were captured in a Đuro Đaković factory. The tanks were due to be shipped to Kuwait, but a part of the shipment was kept by Croatia. A train transporting JNA weapons from Slovenia to Serbia was captured in Slavonski Brod on 21 August. The ZNG seized its first anti-aircraft weapons, anti-tank weapons, and artillery pieces there while adding to its small stock of mortars. The ZNG forces besieging the JNA facilities were mainly drawn from the local populace; reinforcements deployed from other cities were relatively few.|$|E

Allied intelligence firmly identified late in June 1944 that Saint-Leu-d'Esserent and Nucourt were V-1 <b>storage</b> <b>depots.</b> [...] On 27 June 1944, Saint-Leu-d'Esserent was initially bombed by the US Army Air Force, then on July 4/5 1944 by two RAF forces (the first unsuccessfully used Tallboy bombs {{in an attempt to}} collapse the limestone roof of the caves).

The storage tanks burned for five days, giving off a column of smoke {{that could be seen}} 80 miles away. Half a million barrels of petroleum product (comprising Rhodesia's strategic oil reserve) were lost. At a stroke, the country's annual budget deficit was increased by 20%.|$|E
25|$|After the {{establishment}} of the Tsing Yi Bridge, the Hong Kong government commenced an extensive new town project on the island.

The vicinity of the Mobil oil <b>storage</b> <b>depot</b> to Mayfair Garden and Cheung Ching Estate once aroused enormous concern {{for the safety of the}} residents. Some social workers and residents urged the government to relocate the storage facilities. The government decided to halt the last phase of the Mayfair Garden development scheme. The storage facility remained at the same location until Container Terminal 9 was on the government's agenda.|$|E
