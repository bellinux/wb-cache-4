5|$|Fermentation is {{sometimes}} {{carried out in}} two stages, primary and secondary. Once most of the alcohol has been produced during primary fermentation, the beer is transferred to a new vessel and allowed a period of <b>secondary</b> <b>fermentation.</b> <b>Secondary</b> <b>fermentation</b> is used when the beer requires long storage before packaging or greater clarity. When the beer has fermented, it is packaged either into casks for cask ale or kegs, aluminium cans, or bottles for other sorts of beer.|$|E
5|$|Aging / Curing: While {{not always}} {{required}}, some teas required additional aging, <b>secondary</b> <b>fermentation,</b> or baking {{to reach their}} drinking potential. For instance, a green tea puerh, prior to curing into a post-fermented tea, is often bitter and harsh in taste, but becomes sweet and mellow through fermentation by age or dampness. Additionally, oolong can benefit from aging if fired over charcoal. Flavoured teas are manufactured in this stage by spraying the tea with aromas and flavours or by storing them with their flavorants.|$|E

25|$|Primary {{fermentation}} {{usually takes}} 2856 days, {{after which the}} must is placed in a <b>secondary</b> <b>fermentation</b> vessel for 6–9 months of aging.

25|$|The {{transfer}} method {{follows the}} first steps of the traditional method in that after primary fermentation the cuvée is transferred to bottles to complete <b>secondary</b> <b>fermentation,</b> which allows for additional complexity. When the <b>secondary</b> <b>fermentation</b> is complete and the wine has spent the desired {{amount of time in}} bottle on yeast lees (six months is the requirement to label a wine 'bottle fermented') then the individual bottles are transferred (hence the name) into a larger tank. The wine is then filtered, liqueur de dosage added, and then filled back into new bottles for sale. This method allows for complexity to be built into the wine, but also gives scope for blending options after the wine has gone into bottle and reduces the bottle-to-bottle variations that can be hard to control in the traditional method.|$|E

30|$|It was not {{surprising}} that KH 2 PO 4 and K 2 HPO 4 were important nutrients in the defined media in this study because phosphate salts provide a buffering capacity against pH fluctuations that could adversely affect normal metabolic activity. Phosphate is also known to be important for attaining high biomass densities of various fungi. It is also the crucial growth-limiting nutrient in many <b>secondary</b> metabolite <b>fermentations.</b> Thus, supplementing the media with phosphate enhanced AMVL production in A. oryzae MTG 4. However, AMVL production decreased when {{a high concentration of}} phosphate was applied. This result is consistent with the report of Demain ([1986]), who showed that phosphate in the range of 0.3 - 300  mM generally supports extensive cell growth, whereas concentrations of 10  mM and above suppress the biosynthesis of many secondary metabolites.|$|R
25|$|Much of the {{characteristic}} flavour of Madeira {{is due to}} this practice, which hastens the mellowing of the wine and also tends to check <b>secondary</b> <b>fermentation</b> {{in as much as}} it is, in effect, a mild kind of pasteurization. Furthermore, the wine is deliberately exposed to air, causing it to oxidize. The resulting wine has a colour similar to a tawny port wine. Wine tasters sometimes describe a wine which has been exposed to excessive heat during its storage as being cooked or maderized.|$|E

40|$|Background Oenococcus oeni is a {{lactic acid}} {{bacterium}} that is specialised for growth in the ecological niche of wine, where it is noted {{for its ability to}} perform the <b>secondary,</b> malolactic <b>fermentation</b> that is often required for many types of wine. Expanding the understanding of strain-dependent genetic variations in its small and streamlined genome is important for realising its full potential in industrial fermentation processes. Results Whole genome comparison was performed on 191 strains of O. oeni; from this rich source of genomic information consensus pan-genome assemblies of the invariant (core) and variable (flexible) regions of this organism were established. Genetic variation in amino acid biosynthesis and sugar transport and utilisation was found to be common between strains. Furthermore, we characterised previously-unreported intra-specific genetic variations in the natural competence of this microbe. Conclusion By assembling a consensus pan-genome from a large number of strains, this study provides a tool for researchers to readily compare protein-coding genes across strains and infer functional relationships between genes in conserved syntenic regions. This establishes a foundation for further genetic, and thus phenotypic, research of this industrially-important species...|$|R

Fruit lambics are usually bottled with <b>secondary</b> <b>fermentation.</b> Although fruit lambics are among the most famous Belgian fruit beers, the use of names such as kriek, framboise or frambozen, cassis, etc. does not necessarily imply that the beer is made from lambic.

25|$|Fully {{sparkling}} wines, such as Champagne, {{are generally}} sold with 5 to 6 atmospheres of {{pressure in the}} bottle. This is nearly twice the pressure found in an automobile tire. European Union regulations define a sparkling wine as any wine with an excess of 3 atmospheres in pressure. These include German Sekt, Spanish Espumoso, Italian Spumante and French Crémant or Mousseux wines. Semi-sparkling wines are defined as those with between 1 and 2.5 atmospheres of pressures and include German spritzig, Italian frizzante and French pétillant wines. The amount of pressure in the wine {{is determined by the}} amount of sugar added during the tirage stage {{at the beginning of the}} <b>secondary</b> <b>fermentation</b> with more sugar producing increased amount of carbon dioxide gas and thus pressure in the wine.|$|E
25|$|Fermentation {{of sugar}} into alcohol during {{winemaking}} always means that {{carbon dioxide is}} released. Carbon dioxide has the property of being very soluble in water (the main constituent of wine), a property that is utilized in sparkling wines. Production always starts from a base wine (where the carbon dioxide from the first fermentation has been gasified). In i.a. Champagne production the base wine is usually a blend of wines from different grape varieties and different wineries, where the distribution gives the final wine its special character, called cuvée. In some commonly used methods the base wine undergoes a <b>secondary</b> <b>fermentation,</b> which encloses the resulting carbon dioxide under excess pressure and binds it to the liquid in the sparkling wine. In this way the carbon dioxide content is created which, after opening the bottle, produces the bubbles. The dead yeast cells form a precipitate called lees, that often helps with appealing aromas to the sparkling wine but looks unappetizing. The lees is therefore normally removed before the wine is distributed.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} advance made in {{the early}} 19th century was developing a technique to remove the sediment caused by dead yeast after the <b>secondary</b> <b>fermentation.</b> Early Champagne producers chose not to remove the sediment, which left the wine cloudy and prone to off flavors if the sediment was shaken up or poured into the glass. At royal courts and banquets, servers would pour new serving of Champagne into a fresh glass to avoid the residue of sediment left over in the previous glass. To remove the sediments, some producers would decant the wine by pouring it a new bottle. However this process caused {{a considerable amount of}} carbon dioxide gas to escape and the resulting wine was noticeably less bubbly. With the aid of her cellar master, Madame Clicquot of the Champagne house Veuve Cliquot developed the process of riddling in the early 19th century {{to solve the problem of}} sediments without losing much gas. This technique, which involves collecting the sediment in the neck of the bottle and using the pressure of the wine to eject just the sediment, led to the popularity of adding sugar-sweet dosage to replace the wine lost during riddling. The Russians, in particular, were fans of very sweet Champagne and Veuve Cliquot was able to tailor the sweetness level of their wines for their customers by the composition of their dosage. At first the house of Veuve Cliquot tried to keep this technique of riddling a secret but by the late 1820s the secret was out and Champagne houses were settling up production lines for riddling. In 1854, the French national railroad system linked Reims with the rest of the country, including its coastal ports. From that point on, Champagne was connected to its worldwide market and sales grew by leaps and bounds. During the 1850s production was averaging 20 million bottles a year.|$|E

40|$|At present, wine is {{generally}} produced using Saccharomyces yeast followed by Oenococus bacteria to complete malolactic fermentation. This method has some unsolved problems, {{such as the}} management of highly acidic musts {{and the production of}} potentially toxic products including biogenic amines and ethyl carbamate. Here we explore the potential of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe to solve these problems. We characterise an extensive worldwide collection of S. pombe strains according to classic biochemical parameters of oenological interest. We identify three genetically different S. pombe strains that appear suitable for winemaking. These strains compare favourably to standard Saccharomyces cerevisiae winemaking strains, in that they perform effective malic acid deacidification and significantly reduce levels of biogenic amines and ethyl carbamate precursors without the need for any <b>secondary</b> bacterial malolactic <b>fermentation.</b> These findings indicate that the use of certain S. pombe strains could be advantageous for winemaking in regions where malic acid is problematic, and these strains also show superior performance with respect to food safety...|$|R
40|$|Malolactic {{fermentation}} (MLF) is a <b>secondary</b> wine <b>fermentation</b> {{conducted by}} {{lactic acid bacteria}} (LAB). This fermentation is important in winemaking as it deacidifies the wine, it contributes to microbial stability and lastly it contributes to wine aroma through the production of metabolites. Oenococcus oeni is the main species used in commercially available starter culture currently, but {{research has indicated that}} different Lactobacillus species also partake in MLF and this has shifted the focus in the MLF field to evaluate the potential of lactobacilli as starter cultures for the future. There are 17 different species of Lactobacillus associated with winemaking either being associated with the grapes/beginning of alcoholic fermentation or the MLF and wine. Lactobacillus associated with wine is mainly facultative or obligatory heterofermentative and can withstand the harsh wine conditions such as high ethanol levels, low pH and temperatures and sulphur dioxide. Wine lactobacilli contain the malolactic enzyme encoding gene, but sequence homology shows that it clusters separate from O. oeni. Lactobacillus also possesses more enzyme encoding genes compared to O. oeni, important for the production of wine aroma compounds such as glycosidase, protease, esterase, phenolic acid decarboxylase and citrate lyase. Another characteristic associated with wine lactobacilli is the production of bacteriocins, especially plantaricins which would enable them to combat spoilage LAB. All these characteristics, together with their ability to conduct MLF just as efficiently as O. oeni, make them suitable {{for a new generation of}} MLF starter cultures. © 2010 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.

40|$|The {{perception}} of wine flavor and aroma {{is the result}} of a multitude of interactions between a large number of chemical compounds and sensory receptors. Compounds interact and combine and show synergistic (i. e., the presence of one compound enhances the {{perception of}} another) and antagonistic (a compound suppresses the perception of another) interactions. The chemical profile of a wine is derived from the grape, the fermentation microflora (in particular the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae), <b>secondary</b> microbial <b>fermentations</b> that may occur, and the aging and storage conditions. Grape composition depends on the varietal and clonal genotype of the vine and on the interaction of the genotype and its phenotype with many environmental factors which, in wine terms, are usually grouped under the concept of "terroir" (macro, meso and microclimate, soil, topography). The microflora, and in particular the yeast responsible for fermentation, contributes to wine aroma by several mechanisms: firstly by utilizing grape juice constituents and biotransforming them into aroma- or flavor-impacting components, secondly by producing enzymes that transform neutral grape compounds into flavor-active compounds, and lastly by the de novo synthesis of many flavor-active primary (e. g., ethanol, glycerol, acetic acid, and acetaldehyde) and secondary metabolites (e. g., esters, higher alcohols, fatty acids). This review aims to present an overview of the formation of wine flavor and aroma-active components, including the varietal precursor molecules present in grapes and the chemical compounds produced during alcoholic fermentation by yeast, including compounds directly related to ethanol production or secondary metabolites. The contribution of malolactic fermentation, ageing, and maturation on the aroma and flavor of wine is also discussed. © 2011 Society for Industrial Microbiology. Revie...|$|R
