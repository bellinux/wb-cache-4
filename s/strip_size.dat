We focus on the wide (Ql^d≫ 1) and narrow (Ql^d≪ 1) strip regimes.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we propose an {{algorithm}} {{for the detection of}} edges in images that is based on topological asymptotic analysis. Motivated from the Mumford–Shah functional, we consider a variational functional that penalizes oscillations outside some approximate edge set, which we represent as the union of a finite number of thin strips, the width of which is an order of magnitude smaller than their length. In order to find a near optimal placement of these strips, we compute an asymptotic expansion of the functional with respect to the <b>strip</b> <b>size.</b> This expansion is then employed for defining a (topological) gradient descent like minimization method. As opposed to a recently proposed method by some of the authors, which uses coverings with balls, the usage of strips includes some directional information into the method, which can be used for obtaining finer edges and can also result in a reduction of computation times. 1...|$|E

40|$|We {{constructed}} a new time-of-flight (TOF) detector consisting of resistive plate chambers (RPCs) to measure particle {{energy in the}} BGOegg experiment. The BGOegg-RPC has a unique feature which enables us to cover a large area with {{a small number of}} readout channels. For this purpose, we developed the RPC with a <b>strip</b> <b>size</b> of 2. 5 cm × 100 cm. The BGOegg-RPC covers an area of 320 cm × 200 cm with only 256 channels of readout electronics. In case of large readout RPCs, an originated signal is distorted and dispersed during propagation. In addition, there happens a signal reflection {{at the end of the}} strip. Although we designed the BGOegg-RPC and front-end electronics with minimized signal reflection, a small reflection still remained, deteriorating the resulting time resolution.

40|$|High {{precision}} SAD 5 stereo computations can {{be performed}} in an FPGA (field-programmable gate array) at much higher speeds than possible in a conventional CPU (central processing unit), but this uses large amounts of FPGA resources that scale with image size. Of the two key resources in an FPGA, Slices and BRAM (block RAM), Slices scale linearly in the new algorithm with image size, and BRAM scales quadratically with image size. An approach was developed to trade latency for BRAM by sub-windowing the image vertically into overlapping strips and stitching the outputs {{together to create a}} single continuous disparity output. In stereo, the general rule of thumb is that the disparity search range must be 1 / 10 the image size. In the new algorithm, BRAM usage scales linearly with disparity search range and scales again linearly with line width. So a doubling of image size, say from 640 to 1, 280, would in the previous design be an effective 4 of BRAM usage: 2 for line width, 2 again for disparity search range. The minimum <b>strip</b> <b>size</b> is twice the search range, and will produce an output strip width equal to the disparity search range. So assuming a disparity search range of 1 / 10 image width, 10 sequential runs of the minimum <b>strip</b> <b>size</b> would produce a full output image. This approach allowed the innovators to fit 1280 960 wide SAD 5 stereo disparity in less than 80 BRAM, 52 k Slices on a Virtex 5 LX 330 T, 25 % and 24 % of resources, respectively. Using a 100 -MHz clock, this build would perform stereo at 39 Hz. Of particular interest to JPL {{is that there is a}} flight qualified version of the Virtex 5 : this could produce stereo results even for very large image sizes at 3 orders of magnitude faster than could be computed on the PowerPC 750 flight computer. The work covered in the report allows the stereo algorithm to run on much larger images than before, and using much less BRAM. This opens up choices for a smaller flight FPGA (which saves power and space), or for other algorithms in addition to SAD 5 to be run on the same FPGA...|$|E

40|$|Array erasure coding {{technology}} {{is one of}} the most desirable methods to enhance the reliability of storage systems, but fault tolerance is always the bottleneck to the use of array codes. There are several improvement schemes for fault tolerance of array codes now, such as graph theory method, hybrid layout method, and so on. But improvement of the fault tolerance is pretty small, and always cost too much. In view of this, the paper presents a new method to improve fault tolerant ability of array erasure codes. The new method has a highly computing efficiency because all calculations are binary XOR operations, and it is convenient to implement because of its simple construction. Using this new method, we can model a horizontal array code with the optimal updating expenses. Although MDS array codes cannot be modeled by the new method, but storage efficiency can be improved by increasing the <b>strip</b> <b>size.</b> The most important contribution of this paper is that, this new method can construct an array erasure code which has the unconstrained fault tolerant ability in theory...|$|E

Evolution of asperity flattening, contact area ratio and surface roughness is investigated under various simulation rolling conditions. The model reviewed numerical solutions for real surfaces with asperities of arbitrary shape and varying size and height distributions. The rolling characterization has also been identified for asymmetric rolling. The difference of change in surface roughness for upper and lower strip surface is large during rolling. The effect of the speed asymmetry factor on strip bending has been established. An increase of the speed asymmetry factor causes {{an increase in the}} strip curvature, while the force parameters decrease with increasing asymmetry factor.
