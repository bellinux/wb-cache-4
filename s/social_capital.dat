The state police at the time was as much a danger as the brigands. The Villalba Mafia thus emerged as an alternative social regime centred on the membership in church-sponsored associations that generated considerable <b>social</b> <b>capital.</b> It later transformed into a protection racket, victimizing villagers and landowners alike through violence, intimidation and omertà.|$|E

25|$|The role of {{socioeconomic}} status in health equity extends beyond simple monetary restrictions on an individual's purchasing power. In fact, <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> plays {{a significant role}} in the health of individuals and their communities. It has been shown that those who are better connected to the resources provided by the individuals and communities around them (those with more <b>social</b> <b>capital)</b> live longer lives. The segregation of communities on the basis of income occurs in nations worldwide and has a significant impact on quality of health as a result of a decrease in <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> for those trapped in poor neighborhoods. Social interventions, which seek to improve healthcare by enhancing the social resources of a community, are therefore an effective component of campaigns to improve a community's health. A 1998 epidemiological study showed that community healthcare approaches fared far better than individual approaches in the prevention of heart disease mortality.|$|E

He continues by stating that this access to power and political positions, allows for social mobility. Second, Portes states that <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> is generated by social networks of relationships and without the reciprocity, trust, and social norms that come with these networks, a resident who is in need would not be given an opportunity to succeed.|$|E

We listened to stories of career experiences that show how artists learn to negotiate their way by developing their career paths.

Ethnic minority artists can use strategies to manage career, boosting economic, <b>social</b> <b>capitals</b> {{and to a lesser extent}} cultural capital.

25|$|Human capital mostly {{involves}} {{the flow of}} skilled labor. Host countries view the circular migration of highly skilled and educated migrants as positive, while low-skilled labor is often viewed more negatively. Circular migration also allows for the international mobility of labor for shortages in specific sectors in developed countries with the surpluses present in developing countries. The skills that workers acquire while abroad may then benefit the home country upon return. Origin countries seek to increase their access to the labor markets of wealthier countries in hopes of reducing unemployment, increasing remittances, and retaining access to skilled nationals who work abroad. The networks that these skilled laborers establish can greatly benefit the home country, contributing to the <b>social</b> <b>capital.</b> <b>Social</b> <b>capital</b> also involves social remittances, non-material entities such as ideas and practices learned.|$|E

This study aims at investigating the relationship between <b>social</b> cultural <b>capital,</b> LOC and oral proficiency (listening and speaking) of Iranian EFL learners.   It also aims at examining the relationship between <b>social</b> cultural <b>capital</b> and LOC (internal and external). To meet this end, <b>Social</b> Cultural <b>Capital</b> Questionnaire (Pishghadam, Noghani & Zabihi, 2011) and the Persian version of  LOC questionnaire (Ghonsooly & Elahi, 2010) were administered to a sample of 100 upper intermediate EFL students from some language institutes in Mashhad, Iran. Both male (N= 46) and female (N= 54) students filled in two questionnaires.
