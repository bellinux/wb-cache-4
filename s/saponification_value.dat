5000|$|Vegetable {{oils and}} animal fats {{are the main}} {{materials}} that are saponified. These greasy materials, triesters called triglycerides, are mixtures derived from diverse fatty acids. Triglycerides {{can be converted to}} soap in either a one- or a two-step process. In the traditional one-step process, the triglyceride is treated with a strong base (e.g., lye), which accelerates cleavage of the ester bond and releases fatty acid salts and glycerol. This process is the main industrial method for producing glycerol. The free fatty acids without the glycerol are used to form the soap. If necessary, soaps may be precipitated by salting it out with saturated sodium chloride. The <b>saponification</b> <b>value</b> is the amount of base required to saponify a fat sample. For soap making, the triglycerides are highly purified, but saponification includes other base hydrolysis of unpurified triglycerides, for example, the conversion of the fat of a corpse into adipocere, often called [...] "grave wax".

30|$|The <b>saponification</b> <b>value</b> of the {{essential}} oil was 188  mg KOH/g. <b>Saponification</b> <b>value</b> is {{an indicator of the}} average molecular weight and hence chain length. It is inversely proportional to the molecular weight of the oil (Onwuka 2005). High saponification values of oils are due to the predominantly high proportion of shorter carbon chain lengths of fatty acids (Gohari et al. 2011). Low molecular weight (short to medium chain) fatty acids have more glyceride molecules per gram of fat than high molecular weight acids. Each glyceride molecule requires three KOH molecules for saponification; hence, the more the glyceride molecules, the greater the <b>saponification</b> <b>value</b> (Kirk and Sawyer 1991). Nagre et al. (2011) established that <b>saponification</b> <b>value</b> in combination with the acid value gives information on the quantity, type of glycerides, and mean weights of the acids in a given sample. <b>Saponification</b> <b>value</b> is of interest if the oil is for industrial purposes, as it has no nutritional significance (Dari 2009).

30|$|Castor oil is {{extracted}} colourless to very pale yellow viscous liquid {{with a distinct}} taste, mild odour and it boils at 586  K [10]. The hydroxyl group in ricinoleic acid (Fig.  4 a) account for the unique properties of castor oil. For instance, the oil has relatively high viscosity and specific gravity; it is soluble in alcohols in any proportion and has limited solubility in aliphatic petroleum solvents [11]. In addition, the polar hydroxyl group in castor oil makes it compatible with plasticizers {{of a wide variety}} of natural and synthetic resins, waxes, polymers and elastomers [12]. Notable changes on the properties of the castor oil can also be due to several factors such as the method of extraction, seed varieties, weather conditions and soil type. For instance, cold-pressed castor oils have low acid value, low iodine value and a slightly higher <b>saponification</b> <b>value</b> than solvent-extracted oil [1]. It has further been observed that castor seeds from different climatic conditions produce castor oils of different composition and physical–chemical properties [14, 15, 17].

The sanitary and physicochemical qualities of shea butter sold in Benin markets are unknown. This study assesses the quality characteristics of 54 samples of shea butter collected from eight markets in Benin, West Africa. Total germs, yeasts and mould varied with markets. Moisture content ranged between 2. 5 to 6. 2 %. Iodine index was around 49 mgI 2 / 100 g, but acid index (4. 1 to 6. 0 mgKOH/g), peroxide value (9. 4 to 11. 8 meq O 2 /kg) and <b>saponification</b> <b>values</b> (186. 4 to 193. 7 mgKOH/g) showed high variability both within and between samples of different markets. Quality characteristics were poorer for butter collected in the main urban markets (Cotonou, Bohicon and Malanville), due mainly to poor storage conditions. Shea butter could be stored in a clean package before sale to preserve its beneficial qualities...|$|R
40|$|Several {{groundnut}} cultivars {{developed by}} the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-arid Tropics (ICRISAT), and 1 local cultivar {{for use as a}} control were grown in the post-rainy and rainy seasons at Patancheru, India. Free and bound lipids were extracted from kernels and their fatty acid compositions determined. Acid, peroxide, iodine and <b>saponification</b> <b>values</b> were determined. Flavour quality was evaluated using headspace analysis. The quantity of total lipids was significantly higher in the cultivars grown in the rainy season than those grown in the post-rainy season and was higher in the ICRISAT cultivars than in the control in both seasons. Oleic (O) :linoleic (L) acid ratio was lowest in the chloroform-methanol extract and highest in water-saturated butanol extract. One ICRISAT line,ICGS 21, showed the highest O:L ratio in all lipid fractions in both seasons. Among the flavour components, n-methyl pyrrole, associated with an objectionable musty flavour, was present in very high concentration in all the cultivars...|$|R
