2500|$|In the {{four-wire}} three-phase system, {{sometimes called}} [...] "four-wire wye", the <b>safety</b> <b>ground</b> {{is connected to}} a neutral wire that is physically connected to the zero-voltage side of the three windings of the generator or transformer. [...] Since all power phases are relative to the neutral in this system, if the neutral is disconnected, it can be directly measured. [...] In the U.S., the National Electrical Code requires neutrals to be of this type. [...] In this system, power meters measure and sum all three phases relative to the neutral.|$|E
2500|$|NEMA 10 {{connectors}} are a now deprecated {{type that}} had formerly been {{popular in the}} United States for use with high-wattage electric clothes dryers and kitchen ranges; NEMA 14-30R and -50R connectors are now generally used for these applications. NEMA 10s are classified as 125/250V non-grounding (hot-hot-neutral), and were designed {{to be used in}} a manner that indirectly grounds the appliance frame, though not {{in a manner consistent with}} most modern practice. [...] The older practice was common before the requirement of a separate <b>safety</b> <b>ground</b> was incorporated in the National Electrical Code.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{hand-held}} and bench oscilloscopes {{have the}} ground reference voltage {{common to all}} input channels. If more than one measurement channel is used at the same time, all the input signals must have the same voltage reference, and the shared default reference is the [...] "earth". If there is no differential preamplifier or external signal isolator, this traditional desktop oscilloscope is not suitable for floating measurements. (Occasionally an oscilloscope user will break the ground pin in the power supply cord of a bench-top oscilloscope {{in an attempt to}} isolate the signal common from the earth ground. [...] This practice is unreliable since the entire stray capacitance of the instrument cabinet will be connected into the circuit. [...] Since it is also a hazard to break a <b>safety</b> <b>ground</b> connection, instruction manuals strongly advise against this practice.) ...|$|E

2500|$|The basic {{tactical}} {{and administrative}} unit of United States Marine Corps aviation is the squadron, {{which is the}} size/organization equivalent of a battalion. Marine aircraft squadrons (airplane, helicopter, and tilt-rotor), commanded by a lieutenant colonel as the commanding officer, with either a lieutenant colonel or major as executive officer, employ a dual organizational schemata, consisting of a squadron headquarters, containing the executive staff sections of S-1 through S-4, as found in a Marine battalion headuarters (although usually stylized as [...] "departments" [...] vice [...] "sections"), and an aircraft maintenance department (AMD), led by a major, sub-divided into various typical functional divisions as employed in Navy aircraft squadrons. The squadron headquarters also includes a Department of Safety and Standardization (DSS), also headed by a major, who manages the aviation <b>safety,</b> <b>ground</b> safety, and Naval Aviation Training and Operating Procedures Standardization (NATOPS) programs of the squadron.|$|E
2500|$|Industrial {{power is}} {{normally}} supplied as three phase power. [...] There are two forms: three wire, or four wire {{with a system}} neutral. [...] In [...] "three wire" [...] or [...] "three wire delta," [...] , there is no neutral but an earth ground is the <b>safety</b> <b>ground.</b> [...] The three phases have voltage only relative to each other. [...] This distribution method has one fewer wire, is less expensive, and is common in Asia, Africa, and many parts of Europe. [...] In regions that mix residences and light industry, {{it is common for}} this to be the only distribution method. [...] A meter for this type normally measures two of the windings relative to the third winding, and adds the watts. [...] One disadvantage of this system is that if the safety earth fails, it is difficult to discover this by direct measurement, because no phase has a voltage relative to earth.|$|E

50|$|Modern {{stage pin}} {{connectors}} have incorporated a third pin for a <b>safety</b> <b>ground</b> connection and are {{commonly referred to}} as two pin and ground (2P&G) to distinguish them from their ungrounded two-pin predecessors. The ground pin is situated between the line and neutral pins and closer to the latter. This asymmetrical configuration effectively polarizes the connector ensuring that the line and neutral conductors are not exchanged in a properly wired installation. The ground pin is also longer than the other two, ensuring that the <b>safety</b> <b>ground</b> connection is made first when making a connection.|$|E
5000|$|Ground is {{a safety}} {{conductor}} {{with a low}} impedance path to earth. It is often called the [...] "ground wire," [...] or <b>safety</b> <b>ground.</b> It is either bare or has green insulation.|$|E

5000|$|Removal of the <b>safety</b> <b>ground</b> {{connection}} on equipment can expose {{users to}} an increased danger of electric shock and may contradict wiring regulations. The <b>safety</b> <b>ground</b> is disconnected by an adaptor (cheater plug) in a power lead in which the ground conductor is deliberately disconnected, or by cutting a ground pin in the power plug. If a fault develops in any line-operated equipment, cable shields and equipment enclosures may become energized, creating an electric shock hazard. For example, the metal shell of a stage microphone or the strings of a guitar may become energized, creating a hazard to performers. [...] (See Leslie Harvey, John Rostill, Keith Relf) ...|$|E

50|$|Most modern {{stage pin}} {{connectors}} feature a ground pin that {{is longer than}} the line and neutral pins, ensuring that the ground connection is made first, and thus the <b>safety</b> <b>ground</b> is in place before line voltage {{is applied to the}} downstream equipment.|$|E

5000|$|A busbar {{may either}} be {{supported}} on insulators, or else insulation may completely surround it. Busbars are protected from accidental contact either by a metal earthed enclosure or by elevation out of normal reach. [...] Power neutral busbars {{may also be}} insulated {{because it is not}} guaranteed that the potential between power neutral and <b>safety</b> <b>grounding</b> is always zero. Earthing (<b>safety</b> <b>grounding)</b> busbars are typically bare and bolted directly onto any metal chassis of their enclosure. Busbars may be enclosed in a metal housing, in the form of bus duct or busway, segregated-phase bus, or isolated-phase bus.|$|R
50|$|Power {{connectors}} {{must protect}} people from accidental contact with energized conductors. Power connectors often include a <b>safety</b> <b>ground</b> connection {{as well as}} the power conductors. In larger sizes, these connectors must also safely contain any arc produced when an energized circuit is disconnected or may require interlocking to prevent opening a live circuit.|$|E

50|$|They may be keyed {{to prevent}} {{insertion}} in the wrong orientation, connecting the wrong pins to each other, and have locking mechanisms {{to ensure that they}} are fully inserted and cannot work loose or fall out. Some connectors are designed such that certain pins make contact before others when inserted, and break first on disconnection; this protects circuits typically in connectors that apply power, e.g. connecting <b>safety</b> <b>ground</b> first, and sequencing connections properly in hot swapping applications.|$|E
