50|$|Though other styles {{also use}} that term, the <b>spring</b> <b>clamp</b> capo, {{because it can}} be {{operated}} by one hand in one single squeezing motion, is typically the quickest capo to apply or move on the instrument; other capos can be quicker and easier to remove from the instrument. One disadvantage to the <b>spring</b> <b>clamp</b> capo is that the pressure of the spring is not adjustable. The spring applies its maximum pressure to hold the strings down, which could {{have an effect on the}} tuning of some guitars if not applied properly. These capos can typically be applied either to the treble or bass side of the instrument, depending on the player's preference. Two of the most recognizable models of <b>spring</b> <b>clamp</b> capos are manufactured by Dunlop and Kyser.|$|E

50|$|A Fahnestock clip is {{an early}} type of <b>spring</b> <b>clamp</b> {{electrical}} terminal for connections to bare wires. It is still used in educational electronic kits and teaching laboratories in schools. It is designed to grip a bare wire securely, yet release it with {{the push of a}} tab. The clip was patented February 26, 1907 by John Schade Jr., assigned to Fahnestock Electric Co. Less than 2 weeks after the patent was issued they filed for reissue.|$|E
5000|$|Another type of <b>spring</b> <b>clamp,</b> {{typically}} {{only used}} on vacuum hoses, {{is just a}} piece of spring steel wire bent into a loop, with the ends curled to provide handles. These are used similar to standard spring clamps, but are just pinched by hand, and provide very little clamping force. Rather than attempting to seal a hose into a barb, they just place a slight pressure on the hose, helping to keep it from sliding off the barb.|$|E
50|$|Partial capos are a {{relatively}} recent design. Until their creation, some innovative players used their standard capos (or altered capos) to cover {{only some of the}} strings of their instruments. The above-mentioned drop D design was previously achieved, for example, by applying a <b>spring</b> <b>clamp</b> capo to the treble side of the fretboard but leaving the bass E string uncovered. Similarly, users of the Shubb capo altered their capos by cutting off some of the rubber-covered bar's length or by altering the rubber covering to leave certain strings uncapoed.|$|E

50|$|Clark then {{examined}} the prosecution history and prior art of {{both sets of}} patents involved in the case. In the Graham case, the '798 patent was originally rejected by the patent examiner as being insufficiently distinguished from the previous '811 patent. The only two claims which differed between the two patents were (1) the stirrup and the bolted connection of the shank to the hinge plate do not appear in '811; and (2) {{the position of the}} shank is reversed, being placed in patent '811 above the hinge plate, sandwiched between it and the upper plate. One argument which Graham raised before the court, but had not raised before the USPTO, was that in the new '798 design, the flexing of the plow shank was limited to the points between the <b>spring</b> <b>clamp</b> and the tip of the plow shank, absorbing the shock of hard objects on the ground more efficiently. The court rejected this argument and invalidated the '798 patent for two reasons: first, Graham had not raised this “flexing” argument before the USPTO, and second, the parts in the '798 patent served the same purposes as those in the prior art.|$|E
5000|$|Regardless of {{the collet}} design, the {{operating}} principle is the same: squeeze the collet radially against the tool or workpiece to be held, resulting in high static friction. Under correct conditions, it holds quite securely. Almost all collet chucks achieve the radial squeezing motion via moving one or more male-female pairs of tapered (conical) surfaces axially, which produces the radial squeezing in a highly concentric manner. Depending on the collet design, it can be either pulled (via a threaded section {{at the rear of}} the collet) or pushed (via a threaded cap with a second taper) into a matching conical socket to achieve the clamping action. As the collet is forced into the tapered socket, the collet will contract, gripping the contents of the inner cylinder. (The axial movement of cones is not mandatory, however; a split bushing squeezed radially with a linear force—e.g., set screw, solenoid, <b>spring</b> <b>clamp,</b> pneumatic or hydraulic cylinder—achieves the same principle without the cones; but concentricity can only be had to the extent that the bushing's diameters are perfect for the particular object being held. Thus only in toolroom contexts, such as machine tool tooling creation and setup, is this common.) ...|$|E

40|$|Force-measuring clamps {{have been}} invented to {{facilitate}} and simplify {{the task of}} measuring the forces or pressures applied to clamped parts. There is a critical need to measure clamping forces or pressures in some applications for example, while bonding sensors to substrates or while clamping any sensitive or delicate parts. Many manufacturers of adhesives and sensors recommend clamping at specific pressures while bonding sensors or during adhesive bonding between parts in general. In {{the absence of a}} force-measuring clamp, measurement of clamping force can be cumbersome at best because of the need for additional load sensors and load-indicating equipment. One prior method of measuring clamping force involved the use of load washers or miniature load cells in combination with external power sources and load-indicating equipment. Calibrated <b>spring</b> <b>clamps</b> have also been used. Load washers and miniature load cells constitute additional clamped parts in load paths and can add to the destabilizing effects of loading mechanisms. <b>Spring</b> <b>clamps</b> can lose calibration quickly through weakening of the springs and are limited to the maximum forces that the springs can apply. The basic principle of a force-measuring clamp can be implemented on a clamp of almost any size and can enable measurement of a force of almost any magnitude. No external equipment is needed because the component(s) for transducing the clamping force and the circuitry for supplying power, conditioning the output of the transducers, and displaying the measurement value are all housed on the clamp. In other words, a force-measuring clamp is a complete force-application and force-measurement system all in one package. The advantage of unitary packaging of such a system is that it becomes possible to apply the desired clamping force or pressure with precision and ease...|$|R
40|$|A new atomic force {{microscope}} (AFM) {{that operates}} in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) is described. The sample is held fixed with <b>spring</b> <b>clamps</b> while the AMF cantilever and deflection sensor are scanned above it.

The microscope head is capable of coarse x-y positioning over millimeter distances so that AFM images can be taken virtually anywhere upon a macroscopic sample. The optical beam deflection scheme is used for detection, allowing simultaneous normal and lateral force measurements.

40|$|Pulley-based {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT) with metal pushing V-belt (V-belt) offers tremendous potentials in the fuel economy of the car due to its wide and continuous ratio coverage. Nevertheless, the existing pulley-based CVTs in automotive markets use electro-hydro-mechanical (EHM) actuation system to vary its ratio and to provide sufficient clamping force on the V-belt. This, unfortunately, leads to a significant high power consumption from the engine of the car which eventually worsens the car’s fuel economy. To address this issue, researchers introduce electro-mechanical CVT (EM CVT) in which {{the application of the}} EHM actuation system is replaced by an electro-mechanical (EM) actuation system. This paper discusses the application of disc <b>spring</b> in <b>clamping</b> force mechanism of EM CVT. The selected disc spring is analyzed and evaluated to prove its workability for CVT’s application. The analysis results indicate that the application of disc <b>spring</b> in <b>clamping</b> force mechanism of EM CVT is possible and it also offers some benefits particularly in term of its compact design...|$|R
50|$|<b>Spring</b> <b>clamps</b> are {{typically}} {{made from a}} strip of spring steel, cut so that one side has a narrow protrusion centered on the end, {{and the other side}} a pair of narrow protrusions on either side. The ends of these protrusions are then bent outwards, and the strip rolled to form a ring, with the protruding tabs intermeshing. To use the clamp, the exposed tabs are pressed towards each other (typically using pliers), increasing the diameter of the ring, and the clamp is slid onto the hose, past the portion that will go onto the barb. The hose is then fit onto the barb, the clamp expanded again, slid onto the portion of the hose over the barb, then released, compressing the hose onto the barb. Clamps of this design are rarely used for high pressures or large hoses, as they would require unwieldy amounts of steel to generate enough clamping force, and be impossible to work with using just hand tools. They are commonly used on automotive cooling system hoses several inches in diameter, for example on most water-cooled Volkswagen automobiles.|$|R
5000|$|... 'Boat {{building}} uses many or {{the same}} tools that are common house tools such as hammers, cross cut saws, power drills, benches and vices. For building small boats under 5m some specialized tools are needed such as clamps (cramps) either G <b>clamps</b> or <b>spring</b> <b>clamps.</b> A minimum of 4 6inch(150mm) and 10 4inch(100mm) G clamps, plus 20 2 inch(50mm) steel <b>spring</b> <b>clamps</b> is need for ply on frame designs. More is better with clamps. Flat and round surform rasps are useful tools for shaping wood and ply. A drill set from 2-10mm, several speedbore drills for larger holes 12-25mm, (1/2inch-1 inch) rotary sanding backing pads {{and a range of}} replacement sanding pads from coarse (40grit) to fine (180grit), counter sinking drills for screws, a right angle set square, a set of manual screw drivers with blades to match screws being used are essential. A heavy craft knife, an 8m(25 ft) tape, flat and round files for metal and wood, a short(torpedo) level and a set of 3 chisels from 6 to 25mm are needed. Power tools make a job much easier and are relatively cheap. An 7 1/4inch (185mm) circular saw with a fine 40 tooth tungsten carbide blade, a jigsaw with a dust blower with a set of fine, medium and coarse tooth metal and wood blades is good for cutting plywood panels to shape, a rotary oscillating sander with medium and fine pads and a cordless drill for driving screws all save time and energy. A steam box is excellent for making planks easier to bend although hot wet rags are a messy, but easy substitute. A fine tooth hacksaw is not only essential for cutting metal such as trimming stainless steel bolts to the correct length but is handy for ultra-fine cuts in thin wood. A fine-tooth tenon saw is used to cut across the grain to produce a reasonably fine, accurate cut. Some boat builders have started using Japanese draw saws for fine cuts but while these are excellent they tend to be very expensive. A No 4 smoothing plane is essential but an electric plane is very useful (but extremely loud) for making rudder blades and centre boards. A much longer No. 7 plane is needed if the design calls for a wooden spars as used in many modern [...] "traditional" [...] yachts.|$|R
40|$|Consider a {{collection}} of elastic wires folded according to a given pattern induced by a sequence of fractal plane curves. The folded wires can act as elastic springs. Therefore {{it is easy to}} build up a corresponding sequence of simple oscillators composed by the elastic <b>springs</b> <b>clamped</b> at one end and carrying a mass at the opposite end. The oscillation periods of the ordered sequence of these oscillators are related following a power law and therefore display a fractal structure. The periods of each oscillator clearly depend on the mechanical properties of the wire, on the mass at the end and on the boundary conditions. Therefore there are infinitely many possibilities to design a dynamical fractal sequence in opposition to the well defined fractal dimension of the underneath geometric sequence. Nevertheless the geometric fractal dimension of the primordial geometric curve is always related somehow to the dynamical fractal dimension characterizing the oscillation period sequence. It is important to emphasize that the dynamical fractal dimension of a given sequence built up after the geometry of a primordial one is not unique. This peculiarity introduces the possibility to have a broader information spectrum about the geometry which is otherwise impossible to achieve. This effect is clearly demonstrated for rando...|$|R

5000|$|The {{case was}} {{actually}} a set of consolidated appeals of two cases, originating in the same court and dealing with similar issues. The named petitioner, William T. Graham, had sued the John Deere Co. for patent infringement. The invention in question {{was a combination of}} old mechanical elements: a device designed to absorb shock from the shanks of chisel plows as they plow through rocky soil and thus to prevent damage to the plow. Graham sought to solve this problem by attaching the plow shanks to <b>spring</b> <b>clamps,</b> to allow them to flex freely underneath the frame of the plow. He applied for a patent on this clamp, and in 1950, obtained [...] (referred to by the Court as the '811 patent). Shortly thereafter, he made some improvements to the clamp design by placing the hinge plate beneath the plow shank rather than above it, in order to minimize the outward motion of the shank away from the plate. He applied for a patent on this improvement, which was granted in 1953 as [...] (referred to by the court as the '798 patent). While Graham’s patent had been upheld in a previous case before the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed the opinion of the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri and held that the patent was invalid and that the John Deere Co. had not infringed upon it.|$|R
