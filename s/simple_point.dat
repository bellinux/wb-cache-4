500|$|A basic {{derivation}} of the Newtonian {{limit of}} general relativity {{is as old as}} the theory itself. Einstein used it to derive predictions such as the anomalous perihelion precession of the planet Mercury. Later work by Élie Cartan, Kurt Friedrichs and others showed more concretely how a geometrical generalization of Newton's theory of gravity known as Newton–Cartan theory could be understood as a (degenerate) limit {{of general relativity}}. This required letting a specific parameter [...] go to zero. Ehlers extended this work by developing a frame theory that allowed for constructing the Newton–Cartan limit, and in a mathematically precise way, not only for the physical laws, but for any spacetime obeying those laws (that is, solutions of Einstein's equations). This allowed physicists to explore what the Newtonian limit meant in specific physical situations. For example, the frame theory can be used to show that the Newtonian limit of a Schwarzschild black hole is a <b>simple</b> <b>point</b> particle. Also, it allows Newtonian versions of exact solutions such as the Friedmann–Lemaître models or the Gödel universe to be constructed. Since its inception, ideas Ehlers introduced in the context of his frame theory have found important applications in the study of both the Newtonian limit of general relativity and of the Post-Newtonian expansion, where Newtonian gravity is complemented by terms of ever higher order in [...] in order to accommodate relativistic effects.|$|E

[...] On the thirty-third ballot, nine Wisconsin delegates shifted their support from Grant to Elihu Washburne. On the next ballot, sixteen of twenty Wisconsin delegates changed their vote to James Garfield. Garfield immediately called to chairman Hoar to raise a question of order. Garfield [...] "challenge the correctness of the announcement", claiming that without his consent, {{he should not be}} receiving votes. Hoar dismissed Garfield's question, claiming later that he denied Garfield because {{he did not want to}} see a presidency be undone by a <b>simple</b> <b>point</b> of order, meaning he did not want Garfield to stop the momentum for his own candidacy. After the ballot, the vote totals for the major candidates stood at 312 for Grant, 275 for Blaine, 107 for Sherman, and 17 for Garfield. In the thirty-fifth ballot, Benjamin Harrison of Indiana announced that his state would shift all twenty-seven of its votes (mostly coming from the Blaine column) to Garfield. Four Maryland delegates and one delegate each from Mississippi and North Carolina also switched their vote to Garfield, bringing his total to 50.|$|E

40|$|<b>Simple</b> Function <b>Points</b> were {{proposed}} as a lightweight alternative to standard Function Points. The {{idea at the}} base of the definition of <b>Simple</b> Function <b>Points</b> is that it is possible to get equally effective size measures even without considering fine-grained details of functional specifications. Skipping the analysis and measurement of such details should allow for saving time and effort when measuring the functional size of software. In a previous study, the <b>Simple</b> Function <b>Point</b> method was employed to size software applications included in the ISBSG repository, thus employing data from different companies. In this paper, we aim at getting further evidence of the qualities of <b>Simple</b> Function <b>Points</b> via the empirical study of 25 Web applications developed by a single software company. The study highlights the correlation between <b>Simple</b> Function <b>Points</b> and standard Function Points measures and the existence of a significant model that guarantees the convertibility between <b>Simple</b> Function <b>Points</b> and standard Function Points. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the two measures provide predictions of the effort to develop Web applications that are equally accurate. Thus, our results confirm the empirical evidence provided by the original investigation, highlighting that <b>Simple</b> Function <b>Points</b> appear essentially equivalent to Function Points, except that they require a much simpler measurement process...|$|R

6000|$|It {{is perhaps}} partly, though {{certainly}} not entirely, this {{influence of the}} great women writers that explains another very arresting and important fact about the emergence of genuinely Victorian fiction. It had been by this time decided, by the powers that had influence (and by public opinion also, {{at least in the}} middle-class sense), that certain verbal limits must be set to such literature. The novel must be what some would call pure and others would call prudish; but what is not, properly considered, either one or the other: it is rather a more or less business proposal (right or wrong) that every writer shall draw the line at literal physical description of things socially concealed. It was originally merely verbal; it had not, primarily, any dream of purifying the topic or the moral tone. Dickens and Thackeray claimed very properly the right to deal with shameful passions and suggest their shameful culminations; Scott sometimes dealt with ideas positively horrible--as in that grand Glenallan tragedy which is as appalling as the Œdipus or The Cenci. None of these great men would have tolerated for a moment being talked to (as the muddle-headed amateur censors talk to artists to-day) about [...] "wholesome" [...] topics and suggestions [...] "that cannot elevate." [...] They had to describe the great battle of good and evil and they described both; but they accepted a working Victorian compromise about what should happen behind the scenes and what on the stage. Dickens did not claim the license of diction Fielding might have claimed in repeating the senile ecstasies of Gride (let us say) over his purchased bride: but Dickens does not leave the reader in the faintest doubt about what sort of feelings they were; nor is there any reason why he should. Thackeray would not have described the toilet details of the secret balls of Lord Steyne: he left that to Lady Cardigan. But no one who had read Thackeray's version would be surprised at Lady Cardigan's. But though the great Victorian novelists would not have permitted the impudence of the suggestion that every part of their problem must be wholesome and innocent in itself, it is still tenable (I do not say it is certain) that by yielding to the Philistines on this verbal compromise, they have in the long run worked for impurity rather than purity. In one point I do certainly think that Victorian Bowdlerism did pure harm. This is the <b>simple</b> <b>point</b> that, nine times out of ten, the coarse word is the word that condemns an evil and the refined word the word that excuses it. A common evasion, for instance, substitutes for the word that brands self-sale as the essential sin, a word which weakly suggests that it is no more wicked than walking down the street. The great peril of such soft mystifications is that extreme evils (they that are abnormal even by the standard of evil) have a very long start. Where ordinary wrong is made unintelligible, extraordinary wrong can count on remaining more unintelligible still; especially among those who live in such an atmosphere of long words. It is a cruel comment on the purity of the Victorian Age, that the age ended (save for the bursting of a single scandal) in a thing being everywhere called [...] "Art," [...] "The Greek Spirit," [...] "The Platonic Ideal" [...] and so on--which any navvy mending the road outside would have stamped with a word as vile and as vulgar as it deserved.|$|E
