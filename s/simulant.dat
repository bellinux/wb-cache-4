40|$|AbstractThe {{accuracy}} of lunar regolith <b>simulants</b> for lunar drilling and sampling is mainly {{based on their}} particle shape and grain size distribution. To determine the grain-size distribution and shear strength parameters, grain-size distribution tests and conventional tri-axial compression experiments were conducted on the lunar regolith <b>simulants.</b> A new sample preparation apparatus was designed to obtain the shear strength of lunar regolith <b>simulants</b> under high and low confining pressures respectively. Grain-size distribution, cohesion and friction angle of lunar regolith <b>simulants</b> in this paper were compared with lunar regolith and other <b>simulants</b> to illustrate that the strength parameters of the lunar regolith <b>simulants</b> {{can be applied to}} the development of lunar drilling and sampling apparatus and other lunar engineering applications...|$|R

25|$|Yttrium {{aluminium}} garnet (YAG), Y3Al2(AlO4)3, is {{used for}} synthetic gemstones. Due to its fairly high refractive index, YAG {{was used as a}} diamond <b>simulant</b> in the 1970s until the methods of producing the more advanced <b>simulant</b> cubic zirconia in commercial quantities were developed. When doped with neodymium (Nd3+), these YAl-garnets may be used as the lasing medium in lasers.|$|E
25|$|A diamond <b>simulant,</b> diamond {{imitation}} or imitation diamond is {{an object}} or material with gemological characteristics {{similar to those}} of a diamond. Simulants are distinct from synthetic diamonds, which are actual diamonds having the same material properties as natural diamonds. Enhanced diamonds are also excluded from this definition. A diamond <b>simulant</b> may be artificial, natural, or in some cases a combination thereof. While their material properties depart markedly from those of diamond, simulants have certain desired characteristics—such as dispersion and hardness—which lend themselves to imitation. Trained gemologists with appropriate equipment are able to distinguish natural and synthetic diamonds from all diamond simulants, primarily by visual inspection.|$|E
25|$|The {{most recent}} {{composite}} <b>simulant</b> involves combining a CZ core with an outer coating of laboratory created amorphous diamond. The concept effectively mimics {{the structure of}} a cultured pearl (which combines a core bead with an outer layer of pearl coating), only done for the diamond market.|$|E

25|$|Cubic {{zirconia}} is crystallographically isometric, {{an important}} attribute of a would-be diamond <b>simulant.</b> During synthesis zirconium oxide would naturally form monoclinic crystals, its stable form under normal atmospheric conditions. A stabilizer {{is required for}} cubic crystals to form, and remain stable at ordinary temperatures; this may be typically either yttrium or calcium oxide, the amount of stabilizer used depending on the many recipes of individual manufacturers. Therefore, the physical and optical properties of synthesized CZ vary, all values being ranges.|$|E
25|$|Another coating {{treatment}} applies {{a thin film}} of synthetic diamond {{to the surface of}} a diamond <b>simulant.</b> This gives the simulated diamond certain characteristics of real diamond, including higher resistance to wear and scratching, higher thermal conductivity, and lower electrical conductivity. While resistance to wear is a legitimate goal of this technique, some employ it in order to make diamond simulants more difficult to detect through conventional means, which may be fraudulent if they are attempting to represent a simulated diamond as real.|$|E
25|$|Strontium titanate's {{only major}} {{drawback}} (if one excludes excess fire) is fragility. It is both softer (hardness 5.5) and more brittle than synthetic rutile—for this reason, strontium titanate was also combined with more durable materials to create composites. It was otherwise the best <b>simulant</b> {{around at the}} time, and at its peak annual production was 1.5 million carats (300nbsp&kg). Due to patent coverage, all US production was by National Lead, while large amounts were produced overseas by Nakazumi Company of Japan. Commercial names for strontium titanate included Brilliante, Diagem, Diamontina, Fabulite, and Marvelite.|$|E
40|$|Electrochemical coupon testing were {{performed}} on 6 Hanford tank solution <b>simulants</b> and corresponding condensate <b>simulants</b> to evaluate the susceptibility of vapor space and liquid/air interface corrosion. Additionally, partial-immersion coupon testing {{were performed}} on the 6 tank solution <b>simulants</b> to compliment the accelerated electrochemical testing. Overall, the testing suggests that the SY- 102 high nitrate solution is the most aggressive of the six solution <b>simulants</b> evaluated. Alternatively, the most passive solution, based on both electrochemical testing and coupon testing, was AY- 102 solution. The presence of ammonium nitrate in the <b>simulants</b> at the lowest concentration tested (0. 001 M) had no significant effect. At higher concentrations (0. 5 M), ammonium nitrate appears to deter localized corrosion, suggesting a beneficial effect {{of the presence of}} the ammonium ion. The results of this research suggest that there is a threshold concentration of ammonium ions leading to inhibition of corrosion, thereby suggesting the need for further experimentation to identify the threshold...|$|R
5000|$|The {{tests of}} Project 112, {{and the related}} seaborne Project SHAD, were kept secret until October 2002. Many tests {{occurred}} on U.S. soil and released live biological agents, chemical agents or their <b>simulants.</b> In total, according to the reporting of CBS News, more than 5,000 soldiers and sailors {{were involved in the}} secret tests, many of them unknowingly. From 1963-1965 there were 18 tests involving biological <b>simulants,</b> usually Bacillus globigii (BG). BG was used to simulate dangerous agents, such as anthrax; once thought harmless to humans, research in the intervening years has revealed some <b>simulants</b> can actually cause infection in those with weakened immune systems.

25|$|Perhaps {{equally as}} {{important}} is optic character. Diamond and other cubic (and also amorphous) materials are isotropic, meaning that light entering a stone behaves {{the same way}} regardless of direction. Conversely, most minerals are anisotropic, which produces birefringence, or double refraction of light entering the material in all directions other than an optic axis (a direction of single refraction in a doubly refractive material). Under low magnification, this birefringence is usually detectable as a visual doubling of a cut gemstone's rear facets or internal flaws. An effective diamond <b>simulant</b> should therefore be isotropic.|$|E
25|$|Most modern {{commercial}} jewellery continues {{traditional forms}} and styles, but designers such as Georg Jensen have widened {{the concept of}} wearable art. The advent of new materials, such as plastics, Precious Metal Clay (PMC), and colouring techniques, has led to increased variety in styles. Other advances, such as the development of improved pearl harvesting by people such as Mikimoto Kōkichi {{and the development of}} improved quality artificial gemstones such as moissanite (a diamond <b>simulant),</b> has placed jewellery within the economic grasp of a much larger segment of the population.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} be {{considered}} for use as a diamond <b>simulant,</b> a material must possess certain diamond-like properties. The most advanced artificial simulants have properties which closely approach diamond, but all simulants have one or more features that clearly and (for those familiar with diamond) easily differentiate them from diamond. To a gemologist, the most important of differential properties are those that foster non-destructive testing; most of these are visual in nature. Non-destructive testing is preferred because most suspected diamonds are already cut into gemstones and set in jewelry, and if a destructive test (which mostly relies on the relative fragility and softness of non-diamonds) fails, it may damage the simulant—an unacceptable outcome for most jewelry owners, as even if a stone is not a diamond, it may still be of value.|$|E
40|$|The {{planetary}} science decadal {{survey for}} 2013 - 2022 (Vision and Voyages, NRC 2011) has promoted mission concepts for sample acquisition from small solar system bodies. Numerous comet-sampling tools are in development {{to meet this}} standard. Manufactured Porous Ambient Surface <b>Simulants</b> (MPASS) materials {{provide an opportunity to}} simulate variable features at ambient temperatures and pressures to appropriately test potential sample acquisition systems for comets, asteroids, and planetary surfaces. The original "flavor" of MPASS materials is known as Manufactured Porous Ambient Comet <b>Simulants</b> (MPACS), which was developed in parallel with the development of the Biblade Comet Sampling System (Backes et al., in review). The current suite of MPACS materials was developed through research of the physical and mechanical properties of comets from past comet missions results and modeling efforts, coordination with the science community at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and testing {{of a wide range of}} materials and formulations. These <b>simulants</b> were required to represent the physical and mechanical properties of cometary nuclei, based on the current understanding of the science community. Working with cryogenic <b>simulants</b> can be tedious and costly; thus MPACS is a suite of ambient <b>simulants</b> that yields a brittle failure mode similar to that of cryogenic icy materials. Here we describe our suite of comet <b>simulants</b> known as MPACS that will be used to test and validate the Biblade Comet Sampling System (Backes et al., in review) ...|$|R

40|$|Plate-impact {{experiments}} have been employed {{to investigate the}} dynamic response of three readily available tissue <b>simulants</b> for ballistic purposes: gelatin, ballistic soap (both sub-dermal tissue <b>simulants)</b> and lard (adipose layers). All three materials exhibited linear Hugoniot equations-of-state in the US-uP plane. While gelatin behaved hydrodynamically under shock, soap and lard appeared to strengthen under increased loading. Interestingly, the <b>simulants</b> under test appeared to strengthen in a material-independent manner on shock arrival (tentatively attributed to a re-arrangement of the amorphous molecular chains under loading). However, material-specific behaviour was apparent behind the shock. This behaviour appeared to correlate with microstructural complexity, suggesting a steric hindrance effect...|$|R
25|$|The Mohs {{scale of}} mineral {{hardness}} is a non-linear scale of common minerals' resistances to scratching. Diamond {{is at the}} top of this scale (hardness 10), as it is one of the hardest naturally occurring materials known. (Some artificial substances, such as aggregated diamond nanorods, are harder.) Since a diamond is unlikely to encounter substances that can scratch it, other than another diamond, diamond gemstones are typically free of scratches. Diamond's hardness also is visually evident (under the microscope or loupe) by its highly lustrous facets (described as adamantine) which are perfectly flat, and by its crisp, sharp facet edges. For a diamond <b>simulant</b> to be effective, it must be very hard relative to most gems. Most simulants fall far short of diamond's hardness, so they can be separated from diamond by their external flaws and poor polish.|$|E
25|$|National Lead {{was also}} where {{research}} into the synthesis of another titanium compound—strontium titanate (SrTiO3, pure tausonite)—was conducted. Research was done during the late 1940s and early 1950s by Leon Merker and Langtry E. Lynd, who also used a tricone modification of the Verneuil process. Upon its commercial introduction in 1955, strontium titanate quickly replaced synthetic rutile as the most popular diamond <b>simulant.</b> This was due not only to strontium titanate's novelty, but to its superior optics: its RI (2.41) {{is very close to}} that of diamond, while its dispersion (0.19), although also very high, was a significant improvement over synthetic rutile's psychedelic display. Dopants were also used to give synthetic titanate a variety of colors, including yellow, orange to red, blue, and black. The material is also isotropic like diamond, meaning there is no distracting doubling of facets as seen in synthetic rutile.|$|E
25|$|Much {{less common}} than colorless zircon is colorless scheelite. Its {{dispersion}} (0.026) is also {{high enough to}} mimic diamond, but although it is highly lustrous its hardness is much too low (4.5–5.5) to maintain a good polish. It is also anisotropic and fairly dense (SG 5.9–6.1). Synthetic scheelite produced via the Czochralski process is available, but {{it has never been}} widely used as a diamond <b>simulant.</b> Due to the scarcity of natural gem-quality scheelite, synthetic scheelite is much more likely to simulate it than diamond. A similar case is the orthorhombic carbonate cerussite, which is so fragile (very brittle with four directions of good cleavage) and soft (hardness 3.5) that it is never seen set in jewelry, and only occasionally seen in gem collections because it is so difficult to cut. Cerussite gems have an adamantine luster, high RI (1.804–2.078), and high dispersion (0.051), making them attractive and valued collector's pieces. Aside from softness, they are easily distinguished by cerussite's high density (SG 6.51) and anisotropy with extreme birefringence (0.271).|$|E

An on-line qualitative method that uses liquid chromatography/gas chromatography with flame ionization detection discriminates between paraffin waxes and oils in food contact materials, food <b>simulants,</b> and certain simple foods; a Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometric qualitative method also discriminates between waxes and oils, but is usually restricted to food contact materials that do not contain polyolefins and to migration experiments with organic solvents as fatty food <b>simulants</b> (with some other fatty food <b>simulants,</b> paraffin type must then be identified in the food contact material).

25|$|While market {{saturation}} was {{one reason}} for the fall in YAG production levels, another was the recent introduction of the other artificial garnet important as a diamond <b>simulant,</b> gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG; Gd3Ga5O12). Produced in much the same manner as YAG (but with a lower melting point of 1750nbsp&°C), GGG had an RI (1.97) close to, and a dispersion (0.045) nearly identical to diamond. GGG was also hard enough (hardness 7) and tough enough to be an effective gemstone, but its ingredients were also much more expensive than YAG's. Equally hindering was GGG's tendency to turn dark brown upon exposure to sunlight or other ultraviolet source: this was {{due to the fact that}} most GGG gems were fashioned from impure material that was rejected for technological use. The SG of GGG (7.02) is also the highest of all diamond simulants and amongst the highest of all gemstones, which makes loose GGG gems easy to spot by comparing their dimensions with their expected and actual weights. Relative to its predecessors, GGG was never produced in significant quantities; it became more or less unheard of by the close of the 1970s. Commercial names for GGG included Diamonique II and Galliant.|$|E
25|$|The {{hardness}} (8–8.5), RI (2.15–2.18, isotropic), dispersion (0.058–0.066), and low {{material cost}} make CZ {{the most popular}} <b>simulant</b> of diamond. Its optical and physical constants are however variable, owing to the different stabilizers used by different producers. There are many formulations of stabilized cubic zirconia. These variations change the physical and optical properties markedly. While the visual likeness of CZ is close enough to diamond to fool most who do not handle diamond regularly, CZ will usually give certain clues. For example: it is somewhat brittle and is soft enough to possess scratches after normal use in jewelry; it is usually internally flawless and completely colorless (whereas most diamonds have some internal imperfections and a yellow tint); its SG (5.6–6) is high; and its reaction under ultraviolet light is a distinctive beige. Most jewelers will use a thermal probe to test all suspected CZs, a test which relies on diamond's superlative thermal conductivity (CZ, like almost all other diamond simulants, is a thermal insulator). CZ is made {{in a number of}} different colors meant to imitate fancy diamonds (e.g., yellow to golden brown, orange, red to pink, green, and opaque black), but most of these do not approximate the real thing. Cubic zirconia can be coated with diamond-like carbon to improve its durability, but will still be detected as CZ by a thermal probe.|$|E
