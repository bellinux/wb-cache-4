40|$|The vocal {{behavior}} of ziphiid whales is very poorly known. Free-swimming northern bottlenose whales, Hyperoodon ampullatus, {{have been recorded}} producing 3 - 16 kHz whistles and chirps (Winn et al. 1970; linear equipment frequency response 500 Hz- 14 kHz) and 20 - 30 kHz ultrasonic clicks (Fauchner and Whitehead, unpublished data; equipment response to 35 kHz). A free-swimming mesoplodont <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> (probably Mesoplodon hertori) produced ultrasonic clicks (Ljungblad, unpublished data; equipment frequency response to 32 kHz). Sounds have been recorded from a stranded Blainville 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>beaked</b> <b>whale,</b> Mesoplodon densirostris (Caldwell and Caldwell 1971; equipment frequency response 40 Hz- 20 kHz) and a post-stranding, captive Hubb 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>beaked</b> <b>whale,</b> Mesoplodon carlhubbsi (Lynn and Reiss 1992; equipment frequency response 70 Hz- 40 kHz). The latter two species produced low-frequency pulses (mostly 3 ̆c 2 kHz). The Hubb 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> also produced broadband clicks extending beyond the limit of the recording gear (3 ̆e 40 kHz) and a few weak whistles (3 ̆c 10. 7 kHz). During cetacean survey cruises conducted by the National Marine Fisheries Service off the coasts of Oregon, U. S. A., and Baja California, Mexico, we recently made what {{we believe to be}} the first recordings of Baird 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> (Berardius bairdii). On 27 July 1994 the NOAA Ship Snrveyor encountered a group of 30 - 35 Baird 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> about 225 nmi west of Hecata Head, Oregon (at 44 ° 102 ̆ 7 N, 129 ° 102 ̆ 7 W). Two sonobuoys (ex U. S. Navy, type 57 B) were deployed. The first was deployed 1. 6 nmi away from the animals, before a rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RHIB) was launched. The second was deployed 55 min later from the RHIB, within tens of meters from the animals. To relocate the animals after each dive, a continuous search was maintained by two observers searching the forward quadrants with 25 X binoculars and two or more additional observers searching all quadrants with 7 X binoculars and unaided eyes. The only other cetacean seen during this time was one large sperm whale 6 - 10 nmi away. Sounds were recorded using a Nagra IV-SJ analog tape recorder, for a total system response from 20 Hz to 20 kHz. We filtered these recordings at 20 kHz (low pass) and digitized them at 44. 1 kHz (16 bit). Spectrograms (4096 pt FFT, 1024 pt frame length, 87. 5...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} their oceanic habitat, deep diving {{cetacean}} species {{have been found to}} be affected by anthropogenic activities, with potential population impacts of high intensity sounds generated by naval research and oil prospecting receiving the most attention. Improving the knowledge of the distribution and abundance of this poorly known group is an essential prerequisite to inform mitigation strategies seeking to minimize their spatial and temporal overlap with human activities. We provide for the first time abundance estimates for five deep diving cetacean species (sperm whale, long-finned pilot whale, northern bottlenose whale, Cuvier 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> and <b>Sowerby</b> 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>beaked</b> <b>whale)</b> using data from three dedicated cetacean sighting surveys that covered the oceanic and shelf waters of the North-East Atlantic. Density surface modelling was used to obtain model-based estimates of abundance and to explore the physical and biological characteristics of the habitat used by these species. Distribution of all species was found to be significantly related to depth, distance from the 2000 m depth contour, the contour index (a measure of variability in the seabed) and sea surface temperature. Predicted distribution maps also suggest that there is little spatial overlap between these species. Our results represent the best abundance estimates for deep-diving whales in the North-East Atlantic, predict areas of high density during summer and constitute important baseline information to guide future risk assessments of human activities on these species, evaluate potential spatial and temporal trends and inform EU Directives and future conservation efforts...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} mass strandings of <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> have {{in recent decades}} been {{temporally}} and spatially coincident with military activities involving the use of midrange sonar. The social behaviour of <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> is poorly known, it can be inferred from strandings and some evidence of at-sea sightings. It is believed that some <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> species have social organisation at some scale; however most strandings are of individuals, suggesting that they spend at least some part of their life alone. Thus, the occurrence of unusual mass strandings of <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> is of particular importance. In contrast to some earlier reports, the most deleterious effect that sonar may have on <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> may not be trauma to the auditory system {{as a direct result}} of ensonification. Evidence now suggests that the most serious effect is the evolution of gas bubbles in tissues, driven by behaviourally altered dive profiles (e. g. extended surface intervals) or directly from ensonification. It has been predicted that the tissues of <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> are supersaturated with nitrogen gas on ascent due to the characteristics of their deep-diving behaviour. The lesions observed in <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> that mass stranded in the Canary Islands in 2002 are consistent with, but not diagnostic of, decompression sickness. These lesions included gas and fat emboli and diffuse multiorgan haemorrhage. This review describes what is known about <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> anatomy and physiology and discusses mechanisms that may have led to <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> mass strandings that were induced by anthropogenic sonar. <b>Beaked</b> <b>whale</b> morphology is illustrated using Cuvier's <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> as the subject of the review.

40|$|Within {{the genus}} Mesoplodon, {{there are four}} species of <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> that reside in the {{northwest}} Atlantic.

Stock structure for each species is unknown. The distribution of Mesoplodon spp. in the northwest Atlantic is known principally from stranding records (Mead 1989; Nawojchik 1994). Off the northeast USA coast, <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> (Mesoplodon spp.) sightings have occurred principally along {{the southern edge of}} Georges Bank (CETAP, 1982; Waring et al. 1992; NMFS unpubl. data).

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 159 - 166). In recent years, passive {{acoustic survey}} methods {{have become increasingly}} important in marine mammal population and ecosystem studies. Passive acoustic monitoring has been progressively combined with traditional visual survey techniques during line transect surveys for marine mammals. The objectives of this research were to test available automated detection methods for passive acoustic monitoring and integrate the best available method into standard marine mammal monitoring protocols for ship based surveys. Specifically, there were three overarching goals: 1) develop, test, and compare algorithms for automated classification of <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> signals; 2) employ and test techniques for <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> detection at sea; and, 3) use information from automated <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> detections to create the first acoustic based habitat models for <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> species and compare these with visual-based models for the same region. The goal of the first chapter was to evaluate the performance and utility of PAMGUARD 1. 0 Core software for use in automated detection of marine mammal acoustic signals during towed array surveys. Three different detector configurations of PAMGUARD were compared. These automated detection algorithms were evaluated by comparing them {{to the results of}} manual detections made by an experienced bio-acoustician (author TMY). This study provides the first detailed comparisons of PAMGUARD automated detection algorithms to manual detection methods. The results of these comparisons clearly illustrate the utility of automated detection methods for odontocete species. Results of this work showed that the majority of whistles and click events can be reliably detected using PAMGUARD software. The second chapter moves beyond automated detection to examine and test automated classification algorithms for <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> species. <b>Beaked</b> <b>whales</b> are notoriously elusive and difficult to study, especially using visual survey methods. However, due to recent advances in passive acoustic monitoring techniques, <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> are now more effectively detected acoustically than visually during vessel-based (e. g. line-transect) surveys. <b>Beaked</b> <b>whales</b> signals can be discriminated from those of other cetaceans by the unique characteristics of their echolocation clicks (e. g. duration > 175 ??s, center frequencies between 30 - 40 kHz, inter-click intervals between 0. 2 - 0. 4 sec and frequency upsweeps). Furthermore, these same characteristics make these signals ideal candidates for testing automated detection and classification algorithms. There are several different <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> automated detectors currently available for use. However, no comparative analysis of detectors exists. Therefore, comparison between studies and datasets is difficult. The purpose the second chapter was to test, validate, and compare algorithms for detection of <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> in acoustic line-transect survey data. Six different detection algorithms (XBAT, Ishmael, PAMGUARD, ERMA, GMM and FMCD) were evaluated and compared. Detection trials were run on three sample days of towed-hydrophone array recordings collected by NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) during which were confirmed visual sightings of <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> (Ziphius cavirostris and Mesoplodon peruvianus). Detections also were compared to human verified acoustic detections for a subset of these data. In order to measure the probabilities of false detection, each detector was also run on three sample recordings containing clicks from another species: Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus). Qualitative and quantitative comparisons and the detection performance of the different algorithms are discussed. Using data collected at sea from the PAMGUARD classifier developed in Chapter 2 it was possible to measure the clicks from visually verified Baird's <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> encounters and use this data to develop classifiers that could discriminate Baird's <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> from other <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> species in future work. Echolocation clicks from Baird's <b>beaked</b> <b>whales,</b> Berardius bairdii, were recorded during combined visual and acoustic shipboard surveys of cetacean populations in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) and with autonomous, long-term recorders at four different sites in the Southern California Bight (SCB). The preliminary measurement of the visually validated Baird's <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> echolocation signals recorded from the ship-based towed array were used as a basis for identifying Baird's signals in the seafloor-mounted autonomous recorder data. Echolocation signals were segregated into four subsets based on a Gaussian Mixture Model with five mixtures over the peak frequency distribution to describe variability in the signal measurements. The median peak frequency {{for each of the four}} subsets measured from towed array and [long-term seafloor data] was at approximately 9 kHz [9 kHz], 19 kHz [16 kHz], 24 kHz [25 kHz], and 35 kHz [43 kHz]. Two distinct signal types were found, one being a beaked whale-like frequency modulated (FM) pulse, the other being a dolphin-like broadband click. Median center frequency ranged over all subsets and both recording situations from 17 to 36 kHz, - 10 dB bandwidth from 6 to 13 kHz, and Teager-energy duration from 260 to 570 ??s. The median inter-pulse interval was 0. 23 seconds. The description of Baird???s echolocation signals provided here will allow for studies of their distribution and abundance using towed array data without associated visual sightings and from autonomous seafloor hydrophones. The passive acoustic detection algorithms for <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> developed using data from Chapters 2 and 3 were field tested during a three year period to test the reliability of acoustic <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> monitoring techniques and to use these methods to describe <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> habitat in the SCB. In 2009 and 2010, PAM methods using towed hydrophone arrays were tested. These methods proved highly effective for real-time detection of <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> in the SCB and were subsequently implemented in 2011 to successfully detect and track <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> during the ongoing Southern California Behavioral Response Study (SOCAL-BRS). The three year field effort has resulted in (1) the successful classification and tracking of Cuvier's (Ziphius cavirostris), Baird's (Berardius bairdii) and unidentified Mesoplodon <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> species and (2) the identification of areas of previously unknown <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> habitat use. Thus, providing a better understanding of the relationship between <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> occurrence and preferred habitat on a relatively small spatial scale. These findings will provide information for more effective management and conservation of <b>beaked</b> <b>whales.</b> The final step in this research was to utilize the passive acoustic detection techniques developed herin to predictively model <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> habitat use and preferences in the CCE. To date <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> habitat models have been limited in utility due primarily to the small samples of visual observations available to inform the models. This chapter uses a multifaceted approach to model <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> encounter rates in the CCE. <b>Beaked</b> <b>whale</b> acoustic encounters are utilized to inform Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) of encounter rate for <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> in the CCE and compare these to visual based models. Acoustic and visual based models were independently developed for a small <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> group and Baird's <b>beaked</b> <b>whales.</b> Species distributions were modeled using a combination of fixed spatial features (depth, slope, aspect, and distance to the 2000 m isobaths) and variable oceanographic variables (i. e., SST, SSS, logC, and MLD). Two models were evaluated for visual and acoustic encounters, one that also included Beaufort sea state as a predictor variable in addition to those listed and one that did not include Beaufort sea state. The visual and acoustic models differed markedly for both small <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> and Baird's <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> in the predictor variables retained in the best fit models and the regions of high encounter rate prediction. The visual models that included Beaufort sea state as a predictor variable retained this variable in the best fit resulting models. Acoustic models for the small <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> retained fixed spatial features of depth, slope, aspect and distance to the 2000 m isobaths as predictors in the best fit model, whereas only mixed layer depth was retained as a predictor in the best fit Baird's <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> acoustic model. The visual best fit model retained aspect and SST as predictor variables for small <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> and retained all predictor variables in the best fit Baird's <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> model. Differences in all models for Baird's <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> compared to the small <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> indicate that Baird's <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> habitat preferences may be distinctive from other <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> species. This work promotes current understanding of <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> distribution and habitat that can be used to inform <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> management and conservation efforts. This study has demonstrated the feasibility of using acoustic data to inform habitat models. Future work will benefit from utilizing acoustic data to inform habitat models for <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> and likely for other cryptic species as well. The culmination of this research has advanced techniques used in passive acoustic monitoring during towed array marine mammal surveys. The ability to efficiently detect and classify <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> using a towed hydrophone array represents a significant contribution to the field of marine mammal science.

40|$|<b>Beaked</b> <b>whales</b> have mass {{stranded}} {{during some}} naval sonar exercises, but {{the cause is}} unknown. They are difficult to sight but can reliably be detected by listening for echolocation clicks produced during deep foraging dives. Listening for these clicks, we documented Blainville's <b>beaked</b> <b>whales,</b> Mesoplodon densirostris, in a naval underwater range where sonars are in regular use near Andros Island, Bahamas. An array of bottom-mounted hydrophones can detect <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> when they click anywhere within the range. We used two complementary methods to investigate behavioral responses of <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> to sonar: an opportunistic approach that monitored whale responses to multi-day naval exercises involving tactical mid-frequency sonars, and an experimental approach using playbacks of simulated sonar and control sounds to whales tagged with a device that records sound, movement, and orientation. Here we show that in both exposure conditions <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> stopped echolocating during deep foraging dives and moved away. During actual sonar exercises, <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> were primarily detected near {{the periphery of the}} range, on average 16 km away from the sonar transmissions. Once the exercise stopped, <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> gradually filled {{in the center of the}} range over 2 - 3 days. A satellite tagged whale moved outside the range during an exercise, returning over 2 - 3 days post-exercise. The experimental approach used tags to measure acoustic exposure and behavioral reactions of <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> to one controlled exposure each of simulated military sonar, killer whale calls, and band-limited noise. The <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> reacted to these three sound playbacks at sound pressure levels below 142 dB re 1 µPa by stopping echolocation followed by unusually long and slow ascents from their foraging dives. The combined results indicate similar disruption of foraging behavior and avoidance by <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> in the two different contexts, at exposures well below those used by regulators to define disturbance...|$|R
5000|$|Not much {{information}} is available about group composition of <b>beaked</b> <b>whales.</b> Only three species have been studied in any detail: northern bottlenose <b>whales,</b> Blainville's <b>beaked</b> <b>whales,</b> and Baird's <b>beaked</b> <b>whales.</b> Female northern bottlenose whales appear to form a loose network of social partners with no obvious long-term associations. In contrast to females, some male northern bottlenose whales have been repeatedly recorded together over several years, and possibly form long-term associations. Studies of Blainville's <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> have revealed groups usually consist {{of a number of}} females, calves, and/or juvenile animals. These whales are assumed to live in [...] "harem-like" [...] groups, where several females and young are accompanied by a single male.

40|$|Trabajo realizado por: Reyes, C., Schiavi, A., Aguilar del Soto,[EN] <b>Beaked</b> <b>whales</b> (Fam.

The lack of knowledge about the population dynamics and reproductive parameters of these species impedes the assessment of potential population-level effects of stranding mortalities. Estimating the abundance and density of <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> is more difficult than for many other cetacean species, due to the difficulty in identifying most <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> to species level in visual surveys. All this has resulted in few population estimates in the published literature. El Hierro (Canary Islands) harbours resident populations of Blainville’s and Cuvier’s <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> in deep waters close to the shore.

40|$|<b>Beaked</b> <b>whales</b> {{have been}} {{over-represented}} in whale strandings {{that have occurred}} at similar times and places of some naval exercises in the northern hemisphere. Although whale strandings are common, it is unusual to find <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> stranded in such large numbers. Consequently, the environmental management of naval exercises requires mitigation measures to avoid potential impact on <b>beaked</b> <b>whales.</b> This requires some knowledge of <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> distributions and behavior, but {{little is known about}} <b>beaked</b> <b>whales,</b> less than for all other <b>whales.</b> <b>Beaked</b> <b>whales</b> are small whales that inhabit deep water. They are particularly elusive and rarely seen at sea. Much of what little is known about them results from the few that have been washed ashore. Visual surveying has proved to be generally ineffective. <b>Beaked</b> <b>whale</b> vocalizations are, however, sufficiently distinctive to allow passive acoustic detection and classification [1]. The sounds are sufficiently distinctive to distinguish them from those of other toothed whales, though these distinctions are subtle. All toothed whales produce echolocation clicks or pulses with a small number of cycles and most energy at ultrasonic frequencies. <b>Beaked</b> <b>whale</b> clicks can be distinguished by the frequency range, duration and number of cycles but other species have clicks that are close in one or other of the characteristics. In 2008 and 2009 we conducted two passive acoustic surveys of a naval exercise area in deep water in the Coral Sea (north east of Fraser Is.) in an attempt to determine the distributions of <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> in the area of about 18, 900 square km. Each survey was three weeks duration and involved acoustic and visual observations. A towed array of two hydrophones with frequency response to 150 kHz, and two drifting systems with hydrophones at 400 m depth and response to 96 kHz were used (<b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> sounds have an upper limit of about 80 kHz). The drifting systems were tracked using a radio link suspended from a buoy that transmitted the GPS position of the buoy at regular intervals. Nothing was known about the presence of <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> in the area, but there are records of stranding of four species on the nearest part of the Queensland coast. Two of these species were the same as those recorded with the DTAGs. Almost 400 h of recordings were obtained using the towed array and almost 200 h from the drifting systems. Thousands of toothed whale clicks were recorded. Some of the clicks recorded were remarkably similar to those published for <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> [1, 2] and so were identified as <b>beaked</b> <b>whales.</b> Only a small proportion of clicks were typical of <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> sounds and these were recorded mainly over the steep slopes of two coral islands.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} {{the ecology of the}} six species of <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> that occur in the North Atlantic, and define and compare the niches that each species occupies in this area in relation to a number of factors.   To counteract the difficulties of studying <b>beaked</b> <b>whales</b> in the wild, a variety of different approaches were used {{to investigate the}}ir ecology.   From these analyses, a general <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> niche could be identified, covering the niches of all members of the family Ziphiidae in the North Atlantic, as deep-diving oceanic predators of deep-water squid, fish and to a much lesser extent other organisms, in areas with a sloping seabed and in all latitude and temperature ranges.   However, no one species occupies this entire general <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> niche and each species occupies its own niche partition defined by individual species preferences for specific ranges of different niche factors.   The primary partitioning of the general <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> niche is based on prey size, with one group of species, the large prey consumers (LPCs), consisting of two species that consume all prey sizes but preferentially take larger prey, and a second group, the small prey consumers (SPCs), consisting of four species that specialise in consuming smaller prey items.   Within the LPCs, the two species are segregated geographically, probably by water temperature preferences, with Cuvier’s <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> (Ziphius cavirostris) only occurring in warmer, more southern waters and northern bottlenose whale (Hyperoodon ampullatus), only occurring in colder, more northern waters.   Within the SPCs, there is a similar geographic partitioning, with Sowerby’s <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> (Mesoplodon bidens) only occurring in the coldest, most northern waters, Gervais’ <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> (Mesoplodon europaeus) in warmest, most southern waters and True’s <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> (Mesoplodon mirus) in intermediate waters between these two species.   The last <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> species in the North Atlantic, Blainville’s <b>beaked</b> <b>whale</b> (Mesoplodon densirostris) differs from al other species in the habitat if occupies, preferentially occurring in over steeper areas of seabed and in relatively shallow waters, especially around oceanic islands, while all other species preferentially occur over areas with more gentle gradients and deeper water depths.
