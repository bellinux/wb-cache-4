40|$|The {{production}} of <b>soft-shell</b> <b>crabs</b> {{is well established}} in other Asian countries but its sustainability is already being threatened due to the decreasing mud crab population in the wild where the seedstocks are sourced. In the Philippines, {{production of}} <b>soft-shell</b> <b>crabs</b> has only been practiced recently {{due to lack of}} seedstock and technology. Sourcing of crablets from the natural environment is not encouraged due to dwindling populations of all sizes of mud crabs. Instead, it is recommended that crablets for <b>soft-shell</b> <b>crab</b> production come from hatcheries. The project on <b>soft-shell</b> mud <b>crab</b> production at SEAFDEC/AQD started in 2012 and was later funded by the Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquatic and Natural Resources Research and Development of the Department of Science and Technology. The project is adopting the individual crab culture sytem of Thailand and Myanmar in pilot-scale and uses hatchery-reared crablets grown to 60 - 100 g in earthen ponds and stocked in trays. The pilotscale soft-shell production set-up is showcased at the Dumangas Brackishwater Station of SEAFDEC/AQD using crab boxes available in the country. Various sectors are interested to learn how <b>soft-shell</b> <b>crabs</b> are produced. Hence, the previous manual on <b>Soft-shell</b> Mud <b>Crab</b> Farming by Emilia T.

50|$|<b>Soft-shell</b> <b>crab</b> is {{a culinary}} term for crabs that have {{recently}} molted their old exoskeleton {{and are still}} soft. Soft-shells are removed from the water {{as soon as they}} molt to prevent any hardening of their shell. This means that almost the entire animal can be eaten, rather than having to shell the animal to reach the meat. The exceptions are the mouthparts, the gills and the abdomen, which, though edible, are sometimes discarded ("cleaned"). The remaining, edible part of the crab is typically deep fried or sautéed.|$|R
