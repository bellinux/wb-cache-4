5|$|The <b>spoil</b> <b>heap</b> of Writhlington {{colliery}} {{is now the}} Writhlington Site of Special Scientific Interest, {{which includes}} 3,000tons of Upper Carboniferous spoil from which more than 1,400insect fossil specimens have been recovered. The complex geology and narrow seams made coal extraction difficult. Tonnage increased throughout the 19th century, reaching a peak around 1901, when there were 79separate collieries and annual production was 1,250,000tons per annum. However, due to local geological difficulties and manpower shortages output declined {{and the number of}} pits reduced from 30 {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century to 14 by the mid-thirties; the last two pits, Kilmersdon and Writhlington, closed in September 1973. The Great Western Railway and the Somerset and Dorset Railway both established stations and marshalling yards in the town. The last passenger train services to Radstock closed in 1966. Manufacturing industries such as printing, binding and packaging provide some local employment. In recent years, Radstock has increasingly become a commuter town for the nearby cities of Bath and Bristol.|$|E

The 41st Division easily crossed the summit and reached the rear slope of the ridge [...] away, which overlooked the eastern slope and Roozebeke valley, taking many prisoners at Denys and Ravine woods. North of the canal, the 47th Division had to capture a <b>spoil</b> <b>heap</b> [...] long, where several German machine-gun nests had been dug in. The British attacks established a footing on the heap at great cost, due to machine-gun fire from the <b>spoil</b> <b>heap</b> and others in Battle Wood further north.

500|$|In 1763, coal was {{discovered}} in Radstock and mining began in the area. In, 1896 the pits were owned by the Trustee of Frances, late Countess of Waldegrave. The Waldegrave family had been Lords of the Manor of Radstock since the English Civil War. Between 1800 and 1850, Ludlows, Middle Pit, Old Pit, Smallcombe, Tynings, and Wellsway mines opened. There were also a series of pits east of the town at Writhlington and under different ownership. In 1896, they were owned by Writhlington, Huish and Foxcote Colliery Co.; however, following an acrimonious dispute about the terms and conditions of the miners in 1899, a new company, Writhlington Collieries Co., {{was set up to}} run the mines. [...] The Upper and Lower Writhlington, Huish and Foxcote were all merged into one colliery. The <b>spoil</b> <b>heap</b> is a now Writhlington Site of Special Scientific Interest. The site and includes 3,000tons of Upper Carboniferous spoil from which more than 1,400insect fossils have been recovered. These include Phalangiotarbi, and Graeophonus. and the world's earliest known Damselfly. It is a Geological Conservation Review Site.|$|E
500|$|A new {{headgear}} {{and winding}} engine were {{built at the}} Deep pit shaft; ventilation was by means of two axial-type fans installed in an underground chamber. After 1947 a [...] tunnel [...] below ground level was driven to the Stuart Street Power Station, to provide coal direct from the colliery. A conveyor within the tunnel delivered 200 long tons (224 short tons) of small coal an hour to the power station's bunker. Most of the developments begun by Manchester Collieries were completed after nationalisation in 1947 by the National Coal Board (NCB). After modernisation and reconstruction, coal was extracted by longwall mining using coal-cutting machinery and conveyors. This type of mining creates a void or goaf into which the roof is allowed to collapse. At Bradford, which had no <b>spoil</b> <b>heap,</b> the goaf was infilled with spoil or waste. As there was insufficient spoil to fill the void, some was brought from other pits. The NCB incorporated the takes, or coal reserves, of Moston and Ashton Moss Collieries into the redeveloped Bradford Colliery. Moston was closed, but the shafts of Ashton Moss were retained for winding men and equipment.|$|E
500|$|Evidence {{for human}} {{activity}} {{in the vicinity of}} the barrow from the eleventh through to the thirteenth century [...] during the medieval period [...] appeared in the form of 200 ceramic sherds, 2 hones, and 17 fragments of daub found by archaeologists in the top soil. It was likely in this medieval period that the tomb was heavily destroyed, evidenced by medieval material found in some of the pits created by those damaging the chamber and barrow. The destruction was carried out in a systematic manner. Initially, the barrow around the chamber was dug away, and an entrance into it was forced through the drystone wall at the north-western end. The chamber was then cleared down to the bedrock, with the spoil and contents of the chamber dumped behind the diggers. The medial stone of the chamber was pushed over on to the <b>spoil</b> <b>heap,</b> and covered over with soil. A pit was dug in the centre of the chamber, and against its walls from the outside; the central pit was then ceiled by the collapsing capstones. Finally, several more pits were then dug around the façade stones. Subsequently, the chamber collapsed, with a number of stones breaking on the impact of the fall. At some point after they had fallen, the inner pair of the chamber's tall-stones were further damaged, likely in a process involving heating them with fire and then casting cold water onto them, resulting in breakage.|$|E

500|$|At [...] on 7 June, the British {{artillery}} bombardment ceased; expecting {{an immediate}} infantry assault, the German defenders {{returned to their}} forward positions. At [...] the mines were detonated, killing [...] soldiers and destroying most of the middle breastwork Ib of the front system, paralysing {{the survivors of the}} eleven German battalions in the front line, who were swiftly overrun. The explosions occurred while some of the German front line troops were being relieved, catching both groups in the blasts and British artillery fire resumed at the same moment as the explosions. Some of the Stoßtruppen (Stormtroops) in breastwork Ic were able to counter-attack but were overwhelmed quickly as the British advanced on the [...] line, which usually held half of the support battalions but had been reduced to about [...] and six machine-guns, in each [...] regimental zone.

2500|$|The 47th and 23rd Divisions {{formed the}} left {{defensive}} {{flank of the}} attack, advancing onto the ridge around the Ypres–Comines canal and railway, past the mines at Caterpillar and Hill 60.

2500|$|Next {{it passes}} under the A631 Tickhill to Bawtry road at Goole Bridge. The river carries the {{alternative}} name of Goole Dike at this point. The Middle Drain joins the river {{just before it}} crosses the [...] contour, and the western bank is embanked as it passes Reedy Holmes Plantation. Already the meandering course of the river {{has been replaced by}} straight sections with tight bends. The Little Mother Drain, which drains Stancil Carr and Wellingley Low Grounds, joins before the river passes around {{the western edge of the}} huge <b>spoil</b> <b>heap</b> of Rossington Main Colliery, and St Catherine's Well Stream, which flows eastwards from a well between Loversall and Balby joins at the northern edge of the <b>spoil</b> <b>heap.</b> The channel is embanked at a number of locations from here onwards. To the north of Rossington it turns to the east to pass under the East Coast Main Line railway, and then the A638 Great North Road at Rossington Bridge, which it shares with the Mother Drain. This drains the area around Doncaster International Railport and the Potteric Carr Nature Reserve, and the flows combine after the bridge, near the site of some Roman pottery kilns and Wheatcroft fishing lakes.|$|E

2500|$|The Actions of the Bluff were local {{operations}} {{carried out in}} Flanders during the First World War by the German 4th Army and the British Second Army in 1916. The Bluff is a mound near St Eloi, south-east of Ypres in Belgium, created from a <b>spoil</b> <b>heap</b> during the digging of the Ypres–Comines Canal before the war. From [...] and on 2 March 1916, the Germans and the British fought {{for control of the}} Bluff, the Germans capturing the mound and defeating counter-attacks only for the British to recapture it and a stretch of the former German front line, after pausing to prepare a set-piece attack.|$|E
2500|$|Hill 60 was a <b>spoil</b> <b>heap</b> [...] {{long and}} [...] high, {{made from the}} {{diggings}} of a cutting for the Ypres–Comines railway. The hill formed a low rise {{on the crest of}} Ypres ridge, at the southern flank of the Ypres Salient and was named after the contour which marked its boundary. [...] The hill had been captured on 11 November 1914, by the German 30th Division, during fighting against a mixed force of French and British infantry and cavalry, in the First Battle of Ypres. Observation from the hill towards Ypres and Zillebeke was coveted by both sides, {{for the duration of the}} war. Hill 60 and the vicinity were held by Saxon Infantry Regiment 105 of the 30th Division, which with the 39th Division formed XV Corps of the 4th Army, at the time of the British attack.|$|E
2500|$|There are 25 shaftheads {{visible at}} Eylesbarrow, {{most of which}} are on a single curved {{alignment}} along the line of the main lode, which is roughly followed by part of the main track that runs through the mine.

The 80th Brigade of the 27th Division had fought hand-to-hand with the attackers but could not counter-attack, because of a lack of close reserves and German artillery barrages isolating the attack front. Just after midnight, two battalions managed to counter-attack and retook the village and the lost trenches. The Mound was not regained as the Germans had managed to consolidate and retained the advantage of observation from it. Another German attack on 17 March was a costly failure and on 14 April, after a four-day bombardment, the Germans blew another mine at [...] and commenced a systematic bombardment, against which the British artillery replied but no infantry attack followed.|$|E
2500|$|Nottinghamshire, like Derbyshire and South Yorkshire, sits on {{extensive}} coal measures, up to 900 metres (3,000 feet) {{thick and}} occurring {{largely in the}} north of the county. There is an oilfield near Eakring. These are overlaid by sandstones and limestones in the west and clay in the east. The north of the county is part of the Humberhead Levels lacustrine plain. The centre and south west of the county, around Sherwood Forest, features undulating hills with ancient oak woodland. Principal rivers are the Trent, Idle, Erewash and Soar. The Trent, fed by the Soar and Erewash, and Idle, composed of many streams from Sherwood Forest, run through wide and flat valleys, merging at Misterton.

Seventeen-year-old Zoe Nelson's extensively burned remains were found in woodland near a colliery <b>spoil</b> <b>heap</b> known locally as Monkey Hill after her killer constructed a pyre {{in an attempt to}} destroy evidence. Forensic pathologist Julia Bell told the High Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh that the possibilities for a full post mortem were [...] "limited" [...] because the body was too badly burned, but that [...] "some form of throttling or suffocating was the most probable cause of death, which was recorded as 'unascertained'". During their enquiries, police used new media {{for the first time in}} a murder investigation, in an effort to reach out to local teenagers who may otherwise have not wanted to communicate with the police. During the trial it also emerged that the victim's sister had withheld the identity of the killer for five days. On 25 March 2011, 21-year-old Robert Bayne was found guilty of her murder and of a second charge of attempting to defeat the ends of justice. The judge deferred sentencing for psychiatric and social background reports to be prepared. On 27 April 2011 Bayne was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of twenty years, for the murder and six years, to be served concurrently, for the second charge.|$|E
