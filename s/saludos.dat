5|$|Production of {{full-length}} animated features {{was temporarily}} suspended {{after the release}} of Bambi. Given the financial failures of some of the recent features and World War II cutting off much of the overseas cinema market, the studio's financiers at the Bank of America would only loan the studio working capital if it temporarily restricted itself to shorts production. Then in-production features such as Peter Pan, Alice in Wonderland, and Lady and the Tramp were therefore put on hold until after the war. Other issues affecting the studio at the time included the drafting of several Disney animators to fight in World War II, and the necessity for the studio to focus on producing wartime content for the U.S. Army, particularly military training, and civilian propaganda films. From 1942 to 1943, 95 percent of the studio's animation output was for the military. During the war, Disney produced the live-action/animated military propaganda feature Victory Through Air Power (1943), and a series of Latin culture-themed shorts resulting from the 1941 Good Neighbor trip were compiled into two features, <b>Saludos</b> Amigos (1942) and The Three Caballeros (1944).|$|E
500|$|<b>Saludos</b> and Caballeros set the {{template}} for several other 1940s Disney releases of [...] "package films": low-budgeted films composed of animated short subjects with animated or live-action bridging material. These films were Make Mine Music (1946), Fun and Fancy Free (1947), Melody Time (1948), and The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad (1949). The studio also produced two features, Song of the South (1946) and So Dear to My Heart (1948), which used more expansive live-action stories which still included animated sequences and sequences combining live-action and animated characters. Shorts production continued {{during this period}} as well, with Donald Duck, Goofy, and Pluto cartoons being the main output accompanied by cartoons starring Mickey Mouse, Figaro, and in the 1950s, Chip 'n' Dale and Humphrey the Bear.|$|E
2500|$|Tytla {{returned}} to the studio, but [...] "there was too much tension and electricity in the air," [...] according to Adrianne Tytla. With Vladimir, [...] "everything was instinctive and intuitive, and now the vibes were all wrong." [...] Due to {{the economics of the}} studio at the time, assignments were less challenging. In <b>Saludos</b> Amigos (1942) Tytla animated Pedro (a baby airplane) and Jose Carioca (a Brazilian parrot). His small and final portrayals at Disney were a witch and a Nazi teacher in the short Education for Death (1943) and the climactic battle between a giant octopus and an American eagle in the feature Victory Through Air Power (1943). Tytla's perception that he was unwelcome at the studio, less challenging work, his wife's three-year-long illness with tuberculosis, fear of Japanese attack, and a desire to live on his Connecticut farm eventually led him to the decision to leave the studio. He resigned from the Disney studio on February 24, 1943, an action he regretted for the remainder of his life.|$|E

5000|$|South of the Border with Disney is a 1942 Disney short {{documentary}} film. It {{was shot}} in the same occasion <b>Saludos</b> Amigos was, when Walt Disney and a group of eighteen artists, musicians and writers went to South America looking for inspirations for a movie. While <b>Saludos</b> Amigos is the result of this voyage, alternating animated shorts to the sequences from the travel that inspired them, South of the Border with Disney is more of a behind-the-scenes documentary showing only the travel and the genesis of cartoons not only for <b>Saludos</b> Amigos and The Three Caballeros, but also some others used in later occasions. The most notable example is a female Armadillo used for a 1943 Pluto cartoon, Pluto and the Armadillo. Film also includes some pencil test animation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Saludos</b> Amigos (Spanish for Greetings, Friends) is a 1942 American live-action {{animated}} package film {{produced by}} Walt Disney and released by RKO Radio Pictures. It is the sixth Disney animated feature film {{and the first}} of the six package films produced by Walt Disney Productions in the 1940s. Set in Latin America, it is made up of four different segments; Donald Duck stars in two of them and Goofy stars in one. It also features the first appearance of José Carioca, the Brazilian cigar-smoking parrot. <b>Saludos</b> Amigos was popular enough that Walt Disney decided to make another film about Latin America, The Three Caballeros, to be produced two years later. <b>Saludos</b> Amigos premiered in Rio de Janeiro on August 24, 1942. It was released in the United States on February 6, 1943. At 42 minutes, it is Disney's shortest animated feature to date. It garnered positive reviews and was theatrically reissued in 1949, when it was shown on a double bill with the first reissue of Dumbo.|$|E
50|$|At {{approximately}} 41 minutes, {{the film}} {{does not seem}} to fulfill today's expectations for a feature film. However, <b>Saludos</b> Amigos, which is approximately 42 minutes, also {{does not seem to}} meet the criterion. (The official BFI, AMPAS and AFI definition of a feature film requires it to be over 40 minutes long). When excluding the live action between the animated segments, the total amount of actual animation in <b>Saludos</b> Amigos is even less than in Academy Award Review of Walt Disney Cartoons. The official book Disney A to Z by Dave Smith, however, does not include the film in its feature film list.|$|E

The title song of the film used the same melody as Esperón's song [...] "Ay, Jalisco, no te rajes!",with new English lyrics written for it by Ray Gilbert.While these lyrics were not a translation of Ernesto Cortázar's Spanish lyrics nor were they similar to them in any way, the line [...] "Ay, Jalisco, no te rajes!"
