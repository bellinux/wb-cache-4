5|$|Digestive tract telangiectasias may be {{identified}} on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (endoscopy of the esophagus, stomach and {{first part of}} the <b>small</b> <b>intestine).</b> This procedure will typically only be undertaken if there is anemia that is more marked than expected by the severity of nosebleeds, or if there is evidence of severe bleeding (vomiting blood, black stools). If the number of lesions seen on endoscopy is unexpectedly low, the remainder of the <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> may be examined with capsule endoscopy, in which the patient swallows a capsule-shaped device containing a miniature camera which transmits images of the digestive tract to a portable digital recorder.|$|E

We describe a forty years old female patient that arrived at emergency service complained of diffuse abdominal pain.

5|$|Ascending cholangitis, {{also known}} as acute cholangitis or simply cholangitis, is an {{infection}} of the bile duct (cholangitis), usually caused by bacteria ascending from its junction with the duodenum (first part of the <b>small</b> <b>intestine).</b> It tends to occur if the bile duct is already partially obstructed by gallstones.|$|E
5|$|Rotaviruses {{replicate}} {{mainly in}} the gut, and infect enterocytes of the villi of the <b>small</b> <b>intestine,</b> leading to structural and functional changes of the epithelium.

Soluble {{carbohydrates}} such as starches and sugars are readily broken down to glucose in the <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> and absorbed. Insoluble carbohydrates, such as fiber (cellulose), are not digested by the horse's own enzymes, but are fermented by microbes in the cecum and large colon to break down and release their energy sources, volatile fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma, {{also known}} as bile duct cancer, {{is a form of}} cancer that is {{composed}} of mutated epithelial cells (or cells showing characteristics of epithelial differentiation) that originate in the bile ducts which drain bile from the liver into the <b>small</b> <b>intestine.</b> Other biliary tract cancers include gallbladder cancer and cancer of the ampulla of Vater.|$|E

5|$|A 2008 {{study found}} that Andalusians {{experience}} ischaemic (reduced blood flow) diseases of the <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> at a rate significantly higher than other breeds; and stallions had higher numbers of inguinal hernias, with risk for occurrence 30 times greater than other breeds.

5|$|Acetylsalicylic acid is a weak acid, {{and very}} little of it is ionized in the stomach after oral administration. Acetylsalicylic acid is quickly absorbed through the cell {{membrane}} in the acidic conditions of the stomach. The increased pH and larger surface area of the <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> causes aspirin to be absorbed more slowly there, as more of it is ionised. Owing {{to the formation of}} concretions, aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose, and plasma concentrations can continue to rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion.|$|E

25|$|In the <b>small</b> <b>intestines,</b> the {{duodenum}} provides critical pH balancing {{to activate}} digestive enzymes. The liver secretes bile into the duodenum {{to neutralize the}} acidic conditions from the stomach, and the pancreatic duct empties into the duodenum, adding bicarbonate to neutralize the acidic chyme, thus creating a neutral environment. The mucosal tissue of the <b>small</b> <b>intestines</b> is alkaline with a pH of about 8.5.|$|R
5|$|An {{outbreak}} of a gastrointestinal illness in Spain which was causing mortalities in humans {{has been linked}} to western jackdaws. During a post-mortem on an affected bird, a polyomavirus was isolated from the spleen. The illness appeared to be a co-infection of this with Salmonella and the virus has been provisionally named the crow polyomavirus (CPyV). Segmented filamentous bacteria have been isolated from the <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> of a western jackdaw, although their pathogenicity or role is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Frogs have maxillary teeth {{along their}} upper jaw {{which are used}} to hold food before it is swallowed. These teeth are very weak, and cannot be used to chew or catch and harm agile prey. Instead, the frog uses its sticky, cleft tongue to catch flies and other small moving prey. The tongue {{normally}} lies coiled in the mouth, free at the back and attached to the mandible at the front. It can be shot out and retracted at great speed. Some frogs have no tongue and just stuff food into their mouths with their hands. The eyes assist in the swallowing of food {{as they can be}} retracted through holes in the skull and help push food down the throat. The food then moves through the oesophagus into the stomach where digestive enzymes are added and it is churned up. It then proceeds to the <b>small</b> <b>intestine</b> (duodenum and ileum) where most digestion occurs. Pancreatic juice from the pancreas, and bile, produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, are secreted into the <b>small</b> <b>intestine,</b> where the fluids digest the food and the nutrients are absorbed. The food residue passes into the large intestine where excess water is removed and the wastes are passed out through the cloaca.|$|E
5|$|In humans, APOA5 is {{expressed}} {{almost exclusively in}} the liver tissue; some minor expressions have also been detected in the <b>small</b> <b>intestine.</b> Nothing {{is known about the}} existence of the potential alternative splicing variants of this gene. In comparison with other apolipoproteins, plasma concentration of APOA5 is very low (less than 1 μg/mL). This suggests that it has more catalytic than structural functions, since there is less than one APOA5 molecule per one lipoprotein particle. APOA5 is associated predominantly with TG-rich lipoproteins (chylomicrons and VLDL) and has also been detected on HDL particles.|$|E

40|$|Metabolism of {{minerals}} after various {{operations of the}} alimentary tract was studied, and the following Conclusions were obtained: 1) Remarkable differences were seen in metabolism of the minerals especially calcium between partial gastrectomy and total gastrectomy. No disturbance was found after the Partial gastrectomy, but after the total gastrectomy the condition of absorption became unstable, and the accumulation was reduced. The serum calcium content was reduced gradually from one year after total gastrectomy. 2) After a partial resection of the <b>small</b> <b>intestines,</b> a Compensation of mineral metabolism could {{be made by the}} rest part of the intestines, but after extensive resection of the <b>small</b> <b>intestines</b> thee metabolism of calcium was disturbed, and the limitation of the extensive resection of the <b>small</b> <b>intestines</b> should be considered as 2 / 3 of the whole length of the <b>small</b> <b>intestines</b> from the view point of mineral metabolism.

5|$|The {{duodenum}} and the jejunum are {{the first}} and second parts of the <b>small</b> <b>intestine,</b> respectively. The suspensory muscle of the duodenum marks their formal division. The suspensory muscle arises from the right crus of the diaphragm as it passes around the esophagus, continues as connective tissue around the stems of the celiac trunk (celiac artery) and superior mesenteric artery, passes behind the pancreas, and enters {{the upper part of the}} mesentery, inserting into the junction between the duodenum and jejunum, the duodenojejunal flexure. Here, the muscles are continuous with the muscular layers of the duodenum.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 51 species of {{parasitic}} worm {{have been recovered}} from the American white ibis, predominantly from the gastrointestinal system and particularly the <b>small</b> <b>intestine.</b> These include Cestoda (tapeworms), Acanthocephala (thorny headed worms), Nematoda (roundworms), Digenea and Spirurida. Several roundworm and spirurid species {{have been found in}} the lining of the gizzard. Nematodes are more prevalent in American white ibis from freshwater habitats, and cestodes more frequent in those from saltwater areas. One nematode found in adult birds, Skrjabinoclavia thapari, is borne in the fiddler crab as an intermediate host, while the thorny headed worm species Southwellina dimorpha is carried in crayfish and infests both adult and juvenile ibis.|$|E
