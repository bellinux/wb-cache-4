40|$|Memory and {{effector}} T cells modulate subsequently primed T cell {{responses to}} the same antigen. However, {{little is known about}} the impact of pre-existing memory and effector T cell immunity on subsequently primed immune responses <b>to</b> <b>unrelated</b> antigens. Here, we show that an antigen-primed first wave of Th 1 and Th 2 immunity enhanced or inhibited the subsequently primed T cell immunity <b>to</b> an <b>unrelated</b> Antigen, depending on whether the second antigen was administered in the same or opposite type of adjuvant. The regulatory effects of the first wave of T cell immunity on the subsequent T cell responses <b>to</b> an <b>unrelated</b> antigen attenuated over time. Notably, following challenge with the second antigen, there was a mutual cross-regulation between the first and second wave of humoral responses <b>to</b> <b>unrelated</b> antigens. Thus, immunization with one antigen not only primes immune responses to that antigen, but also influences subsequently primed immune responses <b>to</b> <b>unrelated</b> antigens.
