The stones were broken down to a size {{suitable}} {{for use as a}} road surface. With the stone topped road the action of the steel rimmed cart wheels created a loud familiar rhythmic noise of steel on stone which could be heard a long way away. This was a Government funded scheme aimed at providing work and a meagre income for unemployed labour so as to ensure that the families did not suffer too greatly.|$|R

50|$|Punishment {{for minor}} offenses at the National Homes {{included}} monetary fines and no passes for 30 days. For more serious crimes, veterans were often assigned to “dump duty.” In the 19th century, “dump duty” meant emptying and cleaning cuspidors, bedpans, {{and picking up}} trash from the grounds. The most severe penalty inflicted was stone breaking--which was ordered for men who brought whiskey onto the grounds, “jumped the fenced,” or willfully disobeyed orders. <b>Stone</b> <b>breaking</b> began at 7 o’clock in the morning. A man was escorted from the guard house to his work pile and back until his sentence was completed. He got one hour and 20 minutes for lunch and his day ended at 5:40. A <b>stone</b> <b>breaking</b> sentence could last {{for up to six}} months. Repeat incorrigible offenders were dishonorably discharged from the Home.|$|R

In this paper, the ranges of eight vital structure parameters of piston and reversing valve system of hydraulic hammer were selected firstly; and then found the best value of different parameters under experiments with the method of computer optimization and the parametric analysis method provided by ADAMS software. These methods worked and the best design values of parameters of hydraulic hammer were obtained. At last, the optimal impact energy of virtual prototype of hydraulic <b>breaking</b> <b>hammer</b> was calculated and compared with the original impact performance. The results reveal that impact performance of hydraulic hammer has been improved significantly...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In the {{manufacturing}} process of artificial diamond micro powder, if tungsten steel pressure hammer of diamond press makes a tungsten steel hammer pressure crack due to fatigue of workpiece, it is always leading to significant economic losses. The pressure hammer detection and protection device of the diamond press introduced in this paper {{takes advantage of the}} voiceprint recognition technology. Firstly, it extracts the characteristic parameters of pressure <b>hammer</b> <b>breaking</b> voice and establishes a sound pressure <b>hammer</b> <b>breaking</b> template library. And then, the paper compares the work field sound characteristic parameters of diamond press and pressure <b>hammer</b> <b>breaking</b> template library. If they are consistent with each other, the work power of diamond press will be cut down. Thus, it implements protection for the rest good pressure hammers...|$|R

The presence of feathers in a diamond usually {{does not affect the}} life of the stone unless and until the feather runs through a major length of the stone or shows major stress points where it can break. If the cracks reach the surface or have deep fissures, the durability of the stone may be reduced with the possibility of the <b>stone</b> <b>breaking</b> with age.|$|R

40|$|Modern day holmium laser {{systems for}} ureteroscopy (URS) provide users {{with a range}} of settings, namely pulse energy (PE), pulse {{frequency}} (Fr), and pulse width (PW). These variables allow the surgeon to choose different combinations that have specific effects on stone fragmentation during URS lithotripsy. Contact laser lithotripsy can be performed using fragmentation or dusting settings. Fragmentation employs settings of low Fr and high PE to <b>break</b> <b>stones</b> that are then extracted with retrieval devices. Dusting is the utilization of high Fr and low PE settings to <b>break</b> <b>stones</b> into submillimeter fragments for spontaneous passage without the need for basket retrieval. Use of the long PW mode during lithotripsy can reduce stone retropulsion and is increasingly available in new generation lasers. During non-contact laser lithotripsy, stone fragments are rapidly pulverized in a calyx in laser bursts that result in <b>stones</b> <b>breaking</b> into fine fragments. In this review, we discuss the effect of different holmium laser settings on stone fragmentation, and the clinical implications in a very much evolving field...|$|R

He attended Salisbury State University (now Salisbury University), an NCAA Division III school, and played on its football team as a defensive lineman from 1990 to 1993. He was a four-year starter in football and track and field and was named All Mason-Dixon in 1994 for his record <b>breaking</b> <b>hammer</b> throw (168.8 feet) while representing Salisbury State in the NCAA track championships that year as well. Dan was a two-time football team captain and captained the track and field team in 1994. After the 1993 football season, Quinn was co-awarded the prestigious Bobby Richards award.
