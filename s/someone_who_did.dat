[...] Other songs criticise political leaders in the United Kingdom. Higgs had been vocal of his distaste of politics in interviews following the release of Arc. Several critics suggest that [...] "The Wheel (Is Turning Now)" [...] is a commentary on the [...] "snake-oil appeal" [...] of then-UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage; Higgs told The Line of Best Fit that the song also comments on [...] "religious leaders and charismatic, corrupt leaders, or even men as gods". [...] "No Reptiles" [...] supposes that political leaders are [...] "just fat, bald, old men, like soft-boiled eggs, that are just weak-willed, with no strong feelings (good or ill)"; its lyrics also make cryptic reference to Elliot Rodger, who carried out the 2014 Isla Vista killings.|$|E
500|$|An academically gifted but {{socially}} inept freelance {{photographer who}} gets {{bitten by a}} genetically modified spider and gains spider-like abilities, all of which he uses to fight crime as a spider-masked vigilante learning for himself that great power comes with great responsibility. Maguire was cast as Peter in July 2000, having been Raimi's primary choice for the role after he saw The Cider House Rules. The studio was initially hesitant to cast <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not seem to fit the ranks of [...] "adrenaline-pumping, tail-kicking titans", but Maguire managed to impress studio executives with his audition. The actor was signed for a deal {{in the range of}} $3 to $4million with higher salary options for two sequels. To prepare, Maguire was trained by a physical trainer, a yoga instructor, a martial arts expert, and a climbing expert, taking several months to improve his physique. Maguire studied spiders and worked with a wire man to simulate the arachnidlike motion, and had a special diet. The studio had expressed interest in actors Leonardo DiCaprio, Edward Furlong, Freddie Prinze, Jr., Chris Klein, Wes Bentley, and Heath Ledger. Edward Furlong had been considered by James Cameron for the role in 1996, while Raimi joked of Prinze that [...] " [...] won't even be allowed to buy a ticket to see this film." [...] In addition, actors Scott Speedman, Jay Rodan, and James Franco were involved in screen tests for the lead role with Franco later being cast as Harry Osborn.|$|E

2500|$|Little of {{the written}} works of the Kaifeng Jews have survived. [...] A {{significant}} portion, however, are kept {{in the library of}} the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, Ohio. Among the works in that collection are a siddur (a Jewish prayer book) in Chinese characters and a Hebrew codex of the Bible. The codex is notable in that, while it ostensibly contains vowels, it was clearly copied by <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not understand them. While the symbols are accurate portrayals of Hebrew vowels, they appear to be placed randomly, thereby rendering the voweled text as gibberish. Since Hebrew is generally written without vowels, a literate Hebrew speaker can disregard these markings, as the consonants are written correctly, with few scribal errors. The British Library also has a Torah scroll from the Kaifeng Synagogue.|$|E
2500|$|The {{composer}} told Meryle Secrest, [...] "I {{just wanted}} to study composition, theory, and harmony without the attendant musicology that comes in graduate school. But I knew I wanted to write for the theatre, so I wanted <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not disdain theatre music." [...] Barrow suggested that Sondheim study with Milton Babbitt, who Sondheim described as [...] "a frustrated show composer" [...] with whom he formed [...] "a perfect combination." [...] When he met Babbitt, {{he was working on}} a musical for Mary Martin based on the myth of Helen of Troy. Sondheim and Babbitt would meet once a week in New York City for four hours (at the time, Babbitt was teaching at Princeton University). According to Sondheim, they spent the first hour dissecting Rodgers and Hart or George Gershwin or studying Babbitt's favorites (Buddy DeSylva, Lew Brown and Ray Henderson). They then proceeded to other forms of music (such as Mozart's Jupiter Symphony), critiquing them the same way. Babbitt and Sondheim, fascinated by mathematics, studied songs by a variety of composers (especially Jerome Kern). Sondheim told Secrest that Kern had the ability [...] "to develop a single motif through tiny variations into a long and never boring line and his maximum development of the minimum of material". He said about Babbitt, [...] "I am his maverick, his one student who went into the popular arts with all his serious artillery". At Williams, Sondheim wrote a musical adaption of Beggar on Horseback (a 1924 play by George S. Kaufman and Marc Connelly, with permission from Kaufman) which had three performances. A member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity, he graduated magna cum laude in 1950.|$|E

2500|$|British {{newspapers}} The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph both {{reported that}} [...] "The End" [...] had received negative reviews and disappointed its viewers. Alan Sepinwall of Star-Ledger was less enthusiastic of the finale, stating [...] "I'm still wrestling with my feelings about 'The End'... I thought {{most of it}} worked like gangbusters. ... But as <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> spend {{at least part of}} the last six years dwelling on the questions that were unanswered—be they little things like the outrigger shootout or why The Others left Dharma in charge of the Swan station after the purge, or bigger ones like Walt—I can't say I found 'The End' wholly satisfying, either as closure for this season or the series. ... There are narrative dead ends in every season of 'Lost,' but it felt like season six had more than usual." [...] Mike Hale of The New York Times gave [...] "The End" [...] a mixed review, as the episode showed that the series was [...] "shaky on the big picture—on organizing the welter of mythic-religious-philosophical material it insisted on incorporating into its plot—but highly skilled at the small one, the moment to moment business of telling an exciting story. Rendered insignificant ... were the particulars of what they had done on the island." [...] David Zurawik of the Baltimore Sun gave the episode a highly negative review, writing [...] "If this is supposed to be such a smart and wise show, unlike anything else on network TV (blah, blah, blah), why such a wimpy, phony, quasi-religious, white-light, huggy-bear ending. ... Once Jack stepped into the church it looked like he was walking into a Hollywood wrap party without food or music—just a bunch of actors grinning idiotically for 10 minutes and hugging one another." ...|$|E
2500|$|Skepticism {{had existed}} even before Yamano's blog post. [...] The National Archive wrote in {{warning that the}} Archives version of the {{photograph}} {{did not have a}} date. [...] Dorothy Cochrane, a curator at the aeronautics department of the National Air and Space Museum, called the new evidence merely a [...] "blurry photograph" [...] and cited the existing evidence from radio transmissions that suggested that the Electra was at least close to Howland Island, 800 miles away from the Marshall Islands. [...] Author Fukiko Aoki, who researched and wrote a 1982 book, Looking for Amelia, was similarly critical before the revelations from Yamano. [...] Aoki located an elderly officer, part of the 1937 crew of the Kōshū Maru, who denied the ship's involvement. [...] Aoki subsequently researched the Kōshū Maru ship log which showed it as having been 1,500 miles away at the time of Earhart's disappearance. [...] It was also argued that to reach and somehow land on the remote atoll where she purportedly crashed would have required Earhart, though low on fuel, to change her northeast course as she neared Howland Island and fly hundreds of miles northwest. [...] Additionally, had Japanese officials found Earhart, they would have had substantial motivation to rescue and return her considering her fame. [...] The claims of a U.S. government cover-up also came under criticism; the documentary prominently mentions [...] "a report dated January 7, 1939 that Earhart was a prisoner in the Marshall Islands." [...] TIGHAR, a group that advocates the Gardner Island hypothesis of the disappearance, investigated the 1939 government report, which was not hard to find, and found that it was a report on an obvious prankan implausible tale found in France from <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not identify themselves. [...] The message told of being kidnapped by the Japanese, having his crew killed, finding Earhart in custody, then being sent to Europe on an unnamed Japanese ship. [...] TIGHAR wrote that the photo was [...] "neither lost nor evidence" [...] and that the picture had been [...] "exactly where it should be, and was exactly what it was labeled to be, a picture of Jaluit Harbor," [...] criticizing the [...] "lost and misfiled photo" [...] element of The Lost Evidence as well.|$|E
2500|$|After {{they decided}} on the filming {{location}} of BBC Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, Smith and Holland set about creating the 23 characters needed, in just 14 days. They took a holiday in Playa de los Pocillos, Lanzarote, and started to create the characters. Holland created the Beale and Fowler family, drawing on his own background. His mother, Ethel Holland, {{was one of four}} sisters raised in Walthamstow. Her eldest sister, Lou, had married a man named Albert Beale and had two children, named Peter and Pauline. These family members were the basis for Lou Beale, Pete Beale and Pauline Fowler. Holland also created Pauline's unemployed husband Arthur Fowler, their children Mark Fowler and Michelle Fowler, Pete's wife Kathy Beale and their son Ian Beale. Smith used her personal memories of East End residents she met when researching Victorian squares. Ethel Skinner was based on an old woman she met in a pub, with ill-fitting false teeth, and a [...] "face to rival a neon sign", holding a Yorkshire Terrier {{in one hand and a}} pint of Guinness in the other. Other characters created included Jewish doctor Harold Legg, the Anglo-Cypriot Osman family, Ali Osman, Sue Osman and baby Hassan Osman, black father and son, Tony Carpenter and Kelvin Carpenter, single mother Mary Smith and Bangladeshi couple Saeed Jeffery and Naima Jeffery. Jack, Pearl and Tracey Watts were created to bring [...] "flash, trash, and melodrama" [...] to the Square (they were later renamed Den Watts, Angie Watts and Sharon Watts). The characters of Andy O'Brien and Debbie Wilkins were created to show a modern couple with outwardly mobile pretensions, and Lofty Holloway to show an outsider; <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not fit in with other residents. It was decided that he would be a former soldier, as Holland's personal experiences of ex-soldiers were that they had trouble fitting into society after being in the army. When they compared the characters they had created, Smith and Holland realised they had created a cross-section of East End residents. The Beale and Fowler family represented the old families of the East End, who had always been there. The Osmans, Jefferys and Carpenters represented the more modern diverse ethnic community of the East End. Debbie, Andy and Mary represented more modern-day individuals.|$|E
