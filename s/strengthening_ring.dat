The finite element package ANSYS was used to study the nonlinear behavior of such specimens. The finite element model was validated by comparing the computed values with experimental results. The failure mode was local buckling in the flange edge between beam flange and steel tube because of local stress concentration. When the joint was damaged, the stress of weld (including full penetration, partial penetration, and twin fillet weld) between steel tube and interior <b>strengthening</b> <b>ring</b> is smaller than yield strength. The twin fillet weld was proposed for design and construction of the joint instead of {{full penetration weld}}...|$|E

In this paper, {{in order}} to {{understand}} fully the development of failure mechanism, bearing capacity and seismic performance of the steel H-beams and composite concrete filled steel tubular (CFST) column joints strengthened by outside <b>strengthening</b> <b>ring,</b> in the space zone the effects of changing the axial compression ratio is investigated. A 3 D joint finite element model is built up by finite element software ABAQUS, the elastic-plastic finite element analysis is carried through numerical modeling process. The analysis results showed that low axial compression ratio has a little influence on the bearing capacity; with the increase of axial pressure the bearing capacity will decrease in a high axial compression ratio, moreover the failure pattern of joint changes from beam end to column end. The ductility of the specimens is decreased by raising axial compression ratio...|$|E

The interaction of rotating metallic heart valves with magnetic fields is studied by performing a time-domain analysis of the corresponding electromagnetic problem. We applied the finite element method (FEM) to solve the T − Ω formulation of Maxwell equations in two cases: first, for metallic disks located in the high intensity homogenous field of the magnet iso-center, and second, disks located in the non-uniform fringe field of the bore entrance. We showed that for valves with full solid disks (such as Starr-Edwards 6500) located in the magnet iso-center, the magnitude of adverse forces can be comparable to the forces applied by the beating heart. However, for rings which consist of multiply connected conductive regions, skin effect and proximity effect counteract, {{which leads to a}} diminished magnetic force. Results of this study show that mechanical heart valves with <b>strengthening</b> <b>rings</b> may be considered safe even under ultra-high imaging conditions with field intensities as high as 10 T.

In this paper, we prove that if T is good then {{there exists a}} ring C, a homological ring epimorphism B C and a recollement among the (unbounded) derived module categories C of C, B of B, and A of A. In particular, the kernel of the total left derived functor T⊗_B^ L- is triangle equivalent to the derived module category C. Conversely, if the functor T⊗_B^ L- admits a fully faithful left adjoint functor, then T is a good tilting module. We apply our result to tilting modules arising from ring epimorphisms, and can then describe the rings C as coproducts of two relevant rings. Further, in case of commutative rings, we can weaken the condition of being tilting modules, <b>strengthen</b> the <b>rings</b> C as tensor products of two commutative rings, and get similar recollements. Consequently, we can produce examples (from commutative algebra and p-adic number theory, or Kronecker algebra) to show that two different stratifications of the derived module category of a ring by derived module categories of rings may have completely different derived composition factors (even up to ordering and up to derived equivalence),or different lengths.

40|$|The cohesin {{complex is}} {{responsible}} for the fidelity of chromosomal segregation during mitosis. It consists of four core subunits namely Rad 21 /Mcd 1 /Sccl, Smc 1, Smc 3 and one of the yeast Scc 3 orthologs SA 1 or SA 2. Sister chromatid cohesion is formed by the cohesin complex during DNA replication and maintained until the onset of anaphase. Among the many proposed models of how cohesin holds sister chromatids together, the 'core' cohesin subunits Smc 1, Smc 3 and Rad 21 /Mcd 1 /Scc 1 are almost universally displayed as forming a contiguous ring. However, other than its supportive role in the cohesin ring, {{little is known about the}} fourth core protein SA 1 /SA 2 - despite its physical association to the cohesin ring. To gain deeper insight into how physically and physiologically SA 2 interacts with the cohesin complex, we performed structural characterization of SA 2 and Rad 21 and mapped the interaction region of the two proteins in vitro and ex vivo. We found SA 2 interacts with Rad 21 at multiple domains while Rad 21 only interacts with SA 2 through a 10 amino acid α-helical motif from 383 - 392 aa. Deletion of these 10 amino acids or mutation of three conserved amino acids (L 385, F 389, and T 390) in this α-helical motif prevents Rad 21 from physically interacting with SA 2 /SA 1 and causes premature sister chromatid separation in mitotic cells that often leads to aneuploidy. Our studies provide a model for how SA 2 structurally <b>strengthens</b> the cohesin <b>ring</b> through its interaction with Rad 21.

40|$|In {{borosilicate}} glasses, {{not only}} {{the question of the}} fraction of four- and three-fold coordinated boron deserves special consideration, but also the connectivity of the tetrahedral and trigonal borate groups {{with each other and with}} the silicate network. Older structural studies and models of borate and borosilicate glasses often invoke an avoidance rule in the context that negatively charged borate tetrahedra will not be directly linked in glasses. This statement is analogous to the Loewenstein rule which was postulated for aluminate tetrahedra in zeolites. However, contrary to aluminium, directly linked [BØ 4] – tetrahedra are known to exist in natural minerals such as danburite, and not surprisingly, they also occur in glasses (Ø denotes bridging oxygen atoms). Raman spectroscopy confirms, for example, the presence of borate rings consisting of one neutral [BO 3] 0 trigonal and two charged [BØ 4] – tetrahedral units. Four membered danburite-like rings consisting of two linked silicate and two linked borate tetrahedra were also identified by their Raman band at 630 cm – 1 in glasses with higher Na 2 O fractions. Additionally, borate rings consisting of three tetrahedral orthoborate units, [BØ 2 O 2] 3 -, were identified by vibrational spectroscopy in borate glasses containing high levels of MnO or Eu 2 O 3. The presence of such <b>rings</b> <b>strengthens</b> the glass network and results in a second boron oxide anomaly as evidenced by an increase in the glass transition temperature at very high metal oxide contents.

40|$|This {{research}} assesses {{whether a}} refinement {{of the temporal}} resolution of tree-ring data can improve {{our understanding of the}} radial growth-climate relationship. Two study sites in Northern Labrador were chosen, one coastal (Nain), and the other inland (Kamestastin). In Nain, microcore samples were taken weekly from the same five white spruce (Picea glauca) trees over the 2014 growing season. After cross sections were made and stained, the resulting 10 µm thin radii provided a direct view of active ring development. In coastal Labrador, radial growth was initiated during the last week of June 2014, and ceased by August 25 th. Circumference band dendrometers were installed on white spruce trees at both the Nain and Kamestastin sites. The dendrometers were used to measure micrometre-scale changes over the 2014 growing season. Analogous records of temperature were collected with equal temporal resolution, from an Environment Canada climate station (# 8502800), and via a programmable data logger (UX 120 - 006 M, Onset HOBO). Correlation function analysis determined the relationship between daily temperature variables and daily variations in stem size. A strong relationship was found between minimum daily temperature and daily stem size at both sites over the eight week long growing season. Traditional dendrochronological sampling methods were utilized to retrieve tree cores from white spruce and eastern larch (Larix laricina) in Nain and Kamestastin. Site-specific master growth chronologies were created using crossdating and standardization techniques. After establishing long term records of monthly temperature and accumulated growing degree-days (GDD) at both study sites, a linear regression analysis was undertaken to determine the suitability of these two variables as predictors of annual-radial growth. An accumulated June/July GDD index was identified as an overall better predictor of annual ring-width than mean monthly temperature variables in northern Labrador. Exploring radial growth on an intra-annual scale helped to improve our understanding of the complex radial growth-climate relationship in Labrador. This allows for a <b>strengthening</b> of tree <b>rings</b> as a proxy climate indicator in remote regions of the northern boreal forest.

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{occlusive}} means in the caudal genital tract in 5 mares. Since there was no measuring device available, to reliably describe the pressure in the whole caudal genital tract, the first aim of the study was, to develop an adequate ýpressure-gaugeý. After successful development of such a measuring device, the second goal was to identify the ýsealý to the outside world, i. e. the area with the highest occlusive pressure. Therefore pressure measurement was performed in three well defined areas. These were the vestibulum vaginae, the hymenal ring and {{the area of the}} caudal vagina. Measurement was done on 3 consecutive ovulatory oestrous cycles, starting at the 2 nd day post ovulationem, continuing on 5 th, 12 th, 15 th, and from the 17 th day on a daily interval until next ovulation. To investigate the influence of hormonal status and constitutional conditions of the external genitalia on the internal pressure values, before measuring, the length of the following distances were determined: Anus-dorsal commissure, anus-ventral commissure, dorsal commissure-pelvic brim and dorsal commissure-ventral commissure. Vulva´s angle of declination was also measured, using a protractor. After pressure measurement, the mares were examined transrectally and by ultrasonography to verify the state of the sexual cycle. Finally a blood sample was taken, to check the concentration of estrogen- 17 -&# 946; (E 2) and progesterone (P 4) in serum by RIA. Comparison of the values measured in the three locations resulted in the hymenal ring as the area with the highest occlusive pressure. The hymenal ring is not only the place of the most effective reduction in bacteria all over the genital tract in mares (SCHUBERT 1994), it is also the place of the highest occlusive pressure in 4 of 5 investigated mares. Accepting the hymenal ring being the most important occlusive seal to the outside world in the genital tract of the mare, Caslick´s vulvoplasty seems to be no longer an adequate method in the therapy of vulval incompetence/pneumovagina.
