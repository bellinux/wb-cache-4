2500|$|During {{the reign}} of King Levon, the economy of Cilician Armenia progressed greatly and became heavily {{integrated}} with Western Europe. [...] He secured agreements with Pisa, Genoa, and Venice, {{as well as the}} French and the Catalans, and granted them certain privileges such as tax exemptions in return for their business. The three primary harbours of the Armenian Kingdom, which were vital to its economy and defense, were the fortified coastal sites at Ayas and Koŕikos, and the river emporium of Mopsuestia. [...] The latter, situated on two strategic caravan routes, was the last fully navigable port to the Mediterranean on the Pyramus River and the location of warehouses licensed by the Armenians to the Genoese. [...] Important European merchant communities and colonies came into existence, with their own churches, courts of law, and trading houses. As French became the <b>secondary</b> <b>language</b> of Cilician nobility, the <b>secondary</b> <b>language</b> for Cilician commerce had become Italian due to the three Italian city-states' extensive involvement in the Cilician economy. [...] Marco Polo, for example, set out on his journey to China from Ayas in 1271.|$|E

2500|$|Armenian has {{developed}} since the separation from Indo-European mother tongue {{in the third}} millennium BCE to at least {{the time of the}} first Armenian dynasty (the Yervanduni dynasty, founded in the 6th century BCE). Hellenistic influences during the Artashesian Dynasty (2nd century BCE to 1st century CE) led to word borrowings from Greek and Latin. As the state language of the Arshakuni dynasty of Armenia (1st to 5th century CE) was Parthian, a large portion of Armenian vocabulary has been formed from Parthian borrowings. [...] The earliest extant form of written Armenian is from the 5th century and is known as Classical Armenian (5th to 11th century); translations of the Bible and other religious texts during this period led to extensive word borrowings from Hebrew and Syriac. [...] Middle Armenian (12th to 15th century) began with the establishment of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia in the 12th century and is marked by an increased influence of European languages on Armenian, particularly Old French (which had become the <b>secondary</b> <b>language</b> of the Cilician nobility) and Italian (which had become the <b>secondary</b> <b>language</b> of Cilician commerce). Middle Armenian is the first written form of Armenian to display Western-type voicing qualities. [...] Early Modern Armenian (16th to 18th centuries) is a mix of Middle Armenian and an evolving, non-standardized literary Modern Armenian (in Constantinople, Venice, the Ararat plain, and the Persian Armenian communities, particularly New Julfa). [...] As Armenian communities were spread across a large geographic area during this period, early Modern Armenian was influenced by the languages of host societies, with loan words being borrowed from Arabic, Turkish, Persian, Georgian, Latin, Greek, Italian, French, German, Polish, Hungarian, and Russian.|$|E
2500|$|The exact {{origins of}} the Franks are uncertain: they were a group of Germanic peoples that settled in the lower regions of the Rhine river. They were not a unified people {{at the start of}} the 3rd century but {{consisted}} of many tribes which were loosely connected with one another. Although they were intertwined with the Roman Empire the Franks were not a part of it. [...] "No large body of Franks was admitted into the Empire, but individuals and small groups did cross." [...] The Romans were seen as a lower rank in Frankish society. [...] With larger numbers the Franks over took the region of the Rhine. Latin became the <b>secondary</b> <b>language</b> to the Germanic one of the Franks and Frankish law took precedence among the people.
