500|$|Direct {{activation}} of an AAC system is generally {{the first choice}} of access method as it is faster and cognitively easier. [...] Those unable to do so may use indirect selection or [...] "scanning". [...] In this method, items displayed for selection are scanned; the scanning may be visual using indicators such as lights, highlighting, and/or contrasting borders, or auditory using spoken prompts from a communication partner or device. When the desired message is reached, the AAC user indicates the choice using an alternative <b>selection</b> <b>technique</b> such as a switch, vocalization or gesture. Several different patterns for switch access scanning are available: in [...] "circular scanning", the items are displayed in a circle and then scanned one at a time. It is often introduced first to children or beginning AAC users because it is the easiest to understand. In [...] "linear scanning", items are organized in rows and are scanned one at a time until a choice is made. Although more demanding than circular scanning, it is still easy to learn. Finally, in [...] "group-item scanning", items are grouped and the groups scanned consecutively. Once a particular group is selected, items within the group are scanned. One of the most common group-item strategies is row-column scanning in which each row forms a group. The rows of items are scanned and when a row is selected, the items in the row are scanned one at a time until a message is selected.|$|E

Regression test <b>selection</b> <b>techniques</b> reuse tests from an existing test suite to test a modified program. Many regression test <b>selection</b> <b>techniques</b> have been proposed; however, {{it is difficult to}} compare and evaluate these techniques because they have different goals. This paper outlines the issues relevant to regression test <b>selection</b> <b>techniques,</b> and uses these issues as the basis for a framework within which to evaluate the techniques.

40|$|Eye gaze {{interaction}} enables {{users to}} interact with computers using their eyes. A wide variety of eye gaze interaction techniques {{have been developed to}} support this type of interaction. Gaze <b>selection</b> <b>techniques,</b> a class of eye gaze interaction techniques which support target selection, are the subject of this research. Researchers developing these techniques face a number of challenges. The most significant challenge is the limited accuracy of eye tracking equipment (due to the properties of the human eye). The design of gaze <b>selection</b> <b>techniques</b> is dominated by this constraint. Despite decades of research, existing techniques are still significantly less accurate than the mouse. A recently developed technique, EyePoint, represents {{the state of the art}} in gaze <b>selection</b> <b>techniques.</b> EyePoint combines gaze input with keyboard input. Evaluation results for this technique are encouraging, but accuracy is still a concern. Early trigger errors, resulting from users triggering a selection before looking at the intended target, were found to be the most commonly occurring errors for this technique. The primary goal of this research was to improve the usability of gaze <b>selection</b> <b>techniques.</b> In order to achieve this goal, novel gaze <b>selection</b> <b>techniques</b> were developed. New techniques were developed by combining elements of existing techniques in novel ways. Seven novel gaze <b>selection</b> <b>techniques</b> were developed. Three of these techniques were selected for evaluation. A software framework was developed for implementing and evaluating gaze <b>selection</b> <b>techniques.</b> This framework was used to implement the gaze <b>selection</b> <b>techniques</b> developed during this research. Implementing and evaluating all of the techniques using a common framework ensured consistency when comparing the techniques. The novel techniques which were developed were evaluated against EyePoint and the mouse using the framework. The three novel techniques evaluated were named TargetPoint, StaggerPoint and ScanPoint. TargetPoint combines motor space expansion with a visual feedback highlight whereas the StaggerPoint and TargetPoint designs explore novel approaches to target selection disambiguation. A usability evaluation of the three novel techniques alongside EyePoint and the mouse revealed some interesting trends. TargetPoint was found to be more usable and accurate than EyePoint. This novel technique also proved more popular with test participants. One aspect of TargetPoint which proved particularly popular was the visual feedback highlight, a feature which was found to be a more effective method of combating early trigger errors than existing approaches. StaggerPoint was more efficient than EyePoint, but was less effective and satisfying. ScanPoint was the least popular technique. The benefits of providing a visual feedback highlight and test participants' positive views thereof contradict views expressed in existing research regarding the usability of visual feedback. These results have implications for the design of future gaze <b>selection</b> <b>techniques.</b> A set of design principles was developed for designing new gaze <b>selection</b> <b>techniques.</b> The designers of gaze <b>selection</b> <b>techniques</b> can benefit from these design principles by applying them to their technique...|$|R
