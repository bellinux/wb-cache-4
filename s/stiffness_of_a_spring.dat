Energy efficient variable stiffness control (VSA) can reduce the energy consumption yet effectively modulate the dynamic behavior and use stored energy during flexion to assist in subsequent extension. A principle design of energy efficient VSA in a prosthetic knee is proposed and analyzed for the specific case of rejection of a disturbed stance phase.

The usability of this concept to control a prosthetic knee is evaluated using a model. Part of the stance phase of the human leg was modeled by a double pendulum. Specifically the rejection of a common disturbance of transfemoral prosthetic gait, an unlocked knee at heel strike, was evaluated. The ranges of spring stiffnesses were determined such that the angular characteristics of a normal stance phase were preserved, but disturbances could also be rejected.

40|$|Helical springs {{within the}} primary {{suspension}} are critical components for isolating the whole vehicle system from vibration generated at the wheel/rail contact. As train speeds increase, the frequency region of excitation becomes larger, and a simplified static stiffness {{can no longer}} represent the real stiffness property in a vehicle dynamic model. Coil springs in particular exhibit strong internal resonances, which lead to high vibration amplitudes within the spring itself as well as degradation of the vibration isolation. In this paper, the dynamic stiffness matrix method is {{used to determine the}} dynamic <b>stiffness</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> helical <b>spring</b> from <b>a</b> vehicle primary suspension. Results are confirmed with a finite element analysis. Then the spring dynamic stiffness is included within a vehicle-track coupled dynamic model <b>of</b> <b>a</b> high speed train and the effect of the dynamic stiffening of the spring on the vehicle vibration is investigated. It is shown that, for frequencies above about 50 Hz, the dynamic <b>stiffness</b> <b>of</b> the helical spring changes sharply.

The method is based on solving <b>a</b> Lagrangian system <b>of</b> coupled equations for the pile and the soil motions for <b>a</b> range <b>of</b> vibration frequencies and also by considering the vertical, radial and angular stresses on the pile–soil interface. The solution extensively uses Bessel functions of the second kind and results are compared with ﬁnite-element models and ﬁeld pile load tests.

40|$|Abstract The {{nervous system}} can {{regulate}} the mechani-cal {{properties of the}} human ankle through feed-forward mechanisms such as co-contraction and rapid feedback mechanisms such as stretch reflexes. Though each of these strategies may contribute to joint stability, {{it is unclear how}} their relative contribution varies when ankle stability is threatened. We addressed this question by characterizing co-contraction and stretch reflexes during balance <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inverted pendulum simulated by a rotary motor configured as an admittance servo. The stability of this haptic envi-ronment was manipulated by varying the <b>stiffness</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> virtual <b>spring</b> supporting the pendulum. We hypothesized that co-contraction and stretch reflex amplitude would increase as the stability of the haptic load attached to the ankle was reduced. Electromyographic activity in soleus, medial and lateral gastrocnemius, and tibialis anterior was used to characterize co-contraction patterns and stretch reflex amplitude as subjects stabilized the haptic load. Our results revealed that co-contraction was heightened as stability was reduced, but that the resulting joint stiffness was not sufficient to fully counteract the imposed insta-bility. Reflex amplitude, in comparison, was attenuated as load stability was reduced, contrary to results from upper limb studies using similar paradigms. Together these find-ings suggest that the nervous system utilizes feed-forward co-contraction rather than rapid involuntary feedback to increase ankle stability during simple balance tasks. Fur-thermore, since the stiffness generated through co-con-traction was not sufficient to fully balance the haptic load, our results suggest an important role for slower, volitional feedback in the control of ankle stability during balancing tasks...|$|R

40|$|To enhance fuel {{safety and}} to achieve a power uprating, a new concept PWR (Pressurized Water Reactor) fuel, which is called a dual cooled fuel rod, has been studied since 2007. Although there are some {{challenging}} problems about each mechanical component, fuel rod supporting structures are especially dealt within this paper. In the dual-cooled annular fuel rod, an inner flow passage {{as well as an}} outer one is used not only to enhance the fuel safety but to achieve a power uprating through the decreasing fuel center temperature and increasing the heat transfer area between fuel and coolant. As a result, the diameter of dual-cooled fuel rods becomes 1. 6 times bigger than a conventional solid fuel rod and the gap between the annular fuel and the spacer grid’s straps is narrowed. This is a current key issue of fuel rod supports. To accommodate the narrowed gap, spacer grids, such as the cantilever type, hemi-sphere type, circular insertion type, etc., were suggested. For some of these configurations, patents have been applied. The grid <b>springs</b> in <b>a</b> spacer grid play the role of holding the fuel rods in an appropriate position and preventing fuel rods from dropping during normal reactor operation. In the case of the dual cooled fuel rod, the total mass is increased. So, the <b>stiffness</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> grid <b>spring</b> has to be increased more than that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> conventional grid <b>spring.</b> However, if the <b>stiffnesses</b> <b>of</b> springs are increased too much, fuel rods can bend due to the prohibition of their axial slip. So, it is necessary to design an appropriate stiffness. In this paper, the minimum spring force to prevent dual-cooled fuel rods from dropping during normal reactor operation is calculated. The <b>spring</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cantilever type and a hemi-sphere type are predicted. A finite element analysis is carried out by using the commercial code ABAQUS. The analysis results are verified by experiments. Finally, it is checked whether the property of the suggested springs satisfies the minimum required spring force. Based on the obtained results, <b>a</b> kind <b>of</b> spacer grid candidate for dual cooled fuel rods, i. e. a spacer grid with hybrid supports is suggested...|$|R
40|$|Equivalent single- and multi-degree-of-freedom {{models have}} been {{developed}} for a flexible cam-follower mechanism. Both transverse and axial flexibility of the follower and return spring, as well as transverse and torsional flexibility of the camshaft have been included. In the multi-degree-of-freedom model, the camshaft is assigned two rotational degrees of freedom, one at the cam and the other at the flywheel. The follower mass has <b>a</b> degree <b>of</b> freedom in the axial as well as the transverse direction of the follower rod. The analytical models take into account the fluctuating camshaft angular speed as the input excitation. The governing equations of motion, with time-periodic coefficients, have been systematically developed. The return spring was believed to influence the follower response in ways previously not understood, necessitating <b>a</b> closer examination <b>of</b> its kinematics of deformation. An analytic expression for the transverse <b>stiffness</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> closed-coiled helical <b>spring</b> with <b>an</b> axial, transverse and end moment, has been derived. A closed-form expression is obtained when the ends are constrained to remain parallel. Such constraints, and the varying transverse flexibility of the return spring with axial deflection led to a newly described phenomenon <b>of</b> moment stiffening. <b>A</b> sideways tracking <b>of</b> the follower roller on the cam surface is observed, in an experimental cam-follower mechanism, for both the rise and return motions of the follower. It results from the camshaft deflection, causing the cam to exert a thrust load on the follower roller. The tracking gives rise to erroneous experimental cam rise and return profiles. Follower mass responses for Rise-Return-Rise and Rise-Dwell-Return-Dwell follower motion event types, and simple harmonic and polynomial cam rise and return profiles, have been investigated. The multi-degree-of-freedom model, unlike the single-degree-of-freedom model, uniformly predicts the experimental follower mass response accurately for both follower motion events. The overall frequency and amplitude contents of the analytical and experimental responses, noticeably during the top and bottom dwell periods, compare very favorably. Parametric stability charts are presented for both follower motion event types as well as the two cam rise and return profiles considered. ...|$|R
