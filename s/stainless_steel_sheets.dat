40|$|Titanium {{films have}} been {{deposited}} on <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> metal <b>sheets</b> using dc magnetron sputtering technique at different substrate temperatures. The {{structure of the}} titanium films strongly depend on the substrate temperature. The titanium film deposited at the substrate temperature lower than 300 ◦C has a loose flat sheet grains structure and the titanium film prepared at the substrate temperature higher than 500 ◦C has a dense nubby grains structure. The DSSC assembled using <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> coated with titanium film deposited at high substrate temperature has a low charge transfer resistance in the TiO 2 /Ti interface and results in a high conversion efficiency. The DSSC assembled using <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> coated with titanium film deposited at temperature higher than 500 ◦C has higher conversion efficiency than that assembled using titanium metal sheet as the substrate. The maximum conversion efficiency, 2. 26 % is obtained for DSSC assembled using <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> coated with titanium film deposited at 700 ◦C substrate temperature, which is about 70 % of the conversion efficiency of the FTO reference cell used in this study...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Ultra-thin <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> {{is likely}} to be the ideal {{substrate}} materials used for flexible display. In order to obtain ultra-thin <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> substrate with high accuracy, low surface roughness and without damage, the ultra-precision lapping and chemical mechanical polishing technology must be used. In this paper, the lapping paste for <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> has been designed using the orthogonal experiment method. According to the range analysis method, an optimal lapping paste had been obtained. Tests lapping the 304 <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> with the optimal lapping paste have been done. The test results show that the MRR is about 240 nm/min and the surface rough Ra is about 128 nm. This research results can provide theory support for ultra precision machining the <b>stainless</b> <b>steel...</b>|$|R

It is ranked fourth out of 24 public steel corporations in profitability, earning 14.8% equity five years in a row. The company produces carbon, alloy, and clad steel plates along with <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets,</b> strips, plates, hot bands, and slabs.|$|E

The Isa Process technology revolutionized copper refining by replacing copper cathode-starter-sheets with <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> and allowing {{what had been a}} very labour-intensive process to be mechanised.|$|E

5000|$|The US-Mexico Trade Dispute - <b>Stainless</b> <b>Steel</b> <b>Sheets</b> and Coils dumping is a {{trade dispute}} between the governments of The United States and Mexico. On May 26, 2006 Mexico {{requested}} consultations with the United States {{about a number of}} final anti-dumping judgments made by the US Department of Commerce. The judgments concerned the imports of <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> and strips from Mexico, which were supposedly illegal dumping {{through the use of a}} [...] "Zeroing" [...] technique by the US Department of Commerce. Mexico believed that some of the laws, regulations, administrative practices and methodologies implemented by the US impaired and nullified the benefits added to Mexico, directly or indirectly, under the WTO Agreement on Customs Valuation, and that the anti-dumping laws were unwarranted. The consultations were held to discuss activities carried on between January 1999 and June 2004. This led to a panel being established in December 2006, the proceedings of which continued until May 2013, with a mutually agreeable solution being reached. Japan asked to join the consultation in June 2006.|$|E
50|$|An {{interesting}} {{variant of}} the product was also developed, known as Deep-Textured Formica Surfacing. Use of the cellulosic paste allowed using a deeply textured, or even sculptured, metal press sheet atop the decorative sheet, producing a formed surface. The researchers overlaid the <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> with furnace cement, a material easily sculptured or textured, and able to withstand the high heat during curing. They would carve into this cement an illustration, such as natural slate in negative form. When the furnace cement hardened, and the sheet was used in a press pack, the final Unified Core product would have a raised or three-dimensional image.|$|E
50|$|The Anaconda mine {{operated}} for 25 {{years and}} produced approximately 360 {{million tons of}} material from the pit. Most of the material remains in tailings or in leach heap piles. The copper was processed from the extracted ore using two processes. Copper oxide ore (from the upper portion of the pit) was processed by heap leaching, either directly with sulfuric acid in vats to produce a copper solution precipitated by passing it over scrap iron, or by leaching successively in acid and kerosene solutions, subsequently electroplating onto <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets.</b> Copper sulfide ore from the lower portion of the pit was processed by crushing, and flotation with calcium oxide added to the solution to maintain an alkaline pH.|$|E
40|$|<b>Stainless</b> <b>steels</b> {{are well}} known {{to be prone to}} cold welding and {{material}} transfer in sliding contacts and therefore difficult to cold form unless certain precautions as discussed in this paper are taken. In the present study different combinations of tool steels/stainless steels/lubricants has been evaluated with respect to their galling resistance using pin-on-disc testing. The results show that a high galling resistance is favored by a high <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> hardness and a blasted <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> surface topography. The effect of type of lubricant was found to be more complex. For example, the chlorinated lubricants failed to prevent metal-to-metal contact on a brushed sheet surface but succeeded on a blasted sheet surface of the same <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> material. This is believed to be due to a protective tribofilm which is able to form on the blasted surface, but not on the brushed surface...|$|R
40|$|Metallic {{interconnects}} {{in solid}} oxide fuel cells {{are exposed to}} a dual environment: fuel on one side (i. e. H 2 gas) and oxidizer {{on the other side}} (i. e. air). It has been observed that the oxidation behavior of thin <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> in air is changed by the presence of H 2 {{on the other side of}} the sheet. The resulting dual environment scales are flaky and more friable than the single environment scales. The H 2 disrupts the scale on the air-side. A model to explain some of the effects of a dual environment is presented where hydrogen diffusing through the <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> reacts with oxygen diffusing through the scale to form water vapor, which has sufficient vapor pressure to mechanically disrupt the scale. Experiments on preoxidized 316 L <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> tubing exposed to air/air, H 2 /air, and H 2 /Ar environments are reported in support of the model...|$|R
40|$|The {{utilization}} of {{aluminum die casting}} as enclosures where internal equipment is rotating inside of the casting and could fracture requires a strong housing to restrain the fractured parts. A typical example would be a supercharger. In case of a failure, unless adequately contained, fractured parts could injure people operating the equipment. A number of potential reinforcement materials were investigated. The initial work was conducted in sand molds to create experimental conditions that promote prolonged contact of the reinforcing material with molten aluminum. Bonding of Aluminum bronze, Cast iron, and Ni-resist inserts with various electroplated coatings and surface treatments were analyzed. Also toughening of A 354 aluminum cast alloy by <b>steel</b> and <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> wire mesh with various conditions was analyzed. A practical approach to reinforcement of die cast aluminum components {{is to use a}} reinforcing steel preform. Such performs can be fabricated from steel wire mesh or perforated metal sheet by stamping or deep drawing. A hemispherical, dome shaped casting was selected in this investigation. A deep drawing die was used to fabricate the reinforcing performs. The tendency of aluminum cast enclosures to fracture could be significantly reduced by installing a wire mesh of austenitic <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> or a punched austenitic <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> within the casting. The use of reinforcements made of austenitic <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> wire mesh or punched austenitic <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> provided marked improvement in reducing the fragmentation of the casting. The best strengthening was obtained with austenitic <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> wire and with a punched <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> without annealing this material. Somewhat lower results were obtained with the annealed punched <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheet.</b> When the annealed 1020 steel wire mesh was used, the results were only slightly improved because of the lower mechanical properties of this unalloyed steel. The lowest results were obtained with unreinforced 356 aluminum casting. Good strength can be obtained with a sound die casting without any defects produced by squeeze casting. The use of higher pressure to produce the squeeze casting has been shown to increase the strength of a hemispherical dome casting. This dome shape casting has been produced both with and without reinforcement and tested to determine its pressure resistance under internal pressure of water. Only a slight improvement in strength could be determined because of water leaks at the seal between hemispherical dome and its flat supporting side. However, when the ability of the casting was tested under the compressive force of a plunger, the strengthening effect of wire mesh or sheet was evident. Higher loads to failure were obtained because of the reinforcement of the <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> wire and punched sheet. Rather than a sudden failure occurring, the reinforcement of the <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> wire or the punched hard <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> held the material together and prevented any loss of the fractured casting to the surroundings. Unalloyed steel did not have the required strength or mechanical properties to increase the properties of the casting...|$|R
5000|$|In 2015, {{after seven}} years of work, Gharabegian {{released}} the Maximillian Chair. The chair is manufactured in Los Angeles, meticulously handcrafted by expert artisans. It is constructed of stainless steel, polished to a mirror finish. Gharabegian explains the inspiration behind the Maximillian Chair: [...] "when my second son, Maximillian, was born, I took it upon myself to create an object that for me embodied meticulous attention to design proportion and craftsmanship. I wanted to create something that could be as close to a 'perfect' chair as possible. The Maximillian Chair took seven years of design and prototyping to create. Each piece is welded from <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> that are cut with laser precision. It takes six weeks to produce one chair. The fabrics are hand-painted and the chair's hollow structure is meticulously designed like a building. Each chair is numbered, and I gave the first of the 100 pieces to my son." ...|$|E
50|$|For the {{technical}} realization of his projects Wandrey temporarily cooperates with physicians, technology producing companies, and handicraft enterprises. In 1983 he creates the monumental relief Extraterrestrial Dance (1983) using polispectral colored stainless steel. A new {{contact with the}} Norderstedt based printed circuit board manufacturer Heidemarie Heger of Heger GmbH then forms the foundation for many fine arts projects using specially manufactured printed circuit boards as design elements. Professor Dieter Kind, President of the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) in Braunschweig, helps Wandrey to acquire rejected elements from the «H 1» hydrogen maser atomic clock, which he assembles to form the sculpture Atomic Time Guardian (1988). Through Philips RHW, Wandrey is able to access large-format plotter-prints, diagrams of microchips for processor assemblies, which he uses in many of his art compositions. He also uses dual in-line package (DIP), wafers, electrical cables, etc. in many works mounted on <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> or wood. In works such as the Jugglers triptych (1989) and Digitalistic Lesson (1989) he uses this hardware and rigorously robs it of its technological meaning by placing it in a purely artistic context. In Orbiter 1-4 (1990) he uses NASA photographs of Mars and complements their segmented formats with printed circuit boards and laser discs. In 1992 Wandrey discovers the bizarre and exciting shapes of heat sink units at the Fischer Elektronik Company. He then exploits their aesthetic potential as assembly and collage elements for image, sculpture, and object arrangements, {{such as in the}} sculptures Interface 1-10 (1992).|$|E

In this study, a new surface treatment has been applied to the separator of SUS 304 stainless steel, which is a candidate material for a low price separator, to improve electric conductivity. At first, we immersed <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> in the mixture of ethyl alcohol and graphite powder to adhere graphite to the surface of <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> uniformly.

40|$|Abstract. As {{a result}} of the trend of {{consumer}} demand for many stamped sheet metal products, the study of flexible and incremental sheet metal forming and the small-scale production of stamped goods has received considerable attention. In the previous study, Iseki has developed the incremental sheet metal bulging method using water jet for the clean forming without the need for lubricating material. Though he succeeded in shaping wide range of complex shapes of an annealed aluminum sheet (thickness 0. 3 mm, tensile strength 100 MPa), for example, pyramidal shells, shells of pyramid frustums, shallow pans and embossed panels, he was completely unsuccessful in forming shells of a <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> (thickness 0. 3 mm, tensile strength 640 MPa). In the present paper, an incremental bulging method of sheet metal using water jet and shots has been proposed to form shells of a <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheet,</b> and the characteristics of deformation, strain distributions and the forming limit were experimentally studied...|$|R

Among the various materials for vehicle body, <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> and cold rolled steel sheets are under the interests. However, in order to guarantee reliability of new material and to establish the long life fatigue design criteria for body structure, it is necessary to assess spot weldability and fatigue strength of spot welded lap joints fabricated under optimized spot welding condition. In this paper, spot weldability of <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets,</b> STS 304 L and STS 316 L, and cold rolled steel sheets, SPCC and SPCD. Fatigue strength of lap joints spot welded between similar and dissimilar materials were also assessed...|$|E
30|$|The {{bend angle}} per laser scan {{is small and}} therefore, the laser bending is also carried out with the {{assistance}} of mechanical load. Yanjin et al. (2003) showed that pre-loading can increase the bend angle significantly. Yao et al. (2007) presented effect of various pre-loads on laser bending process. They employed pure compression, pure tension and pure bending as pre-loading and observed that pre-loading does not cause any external edge effect. Kant and Joshi (2013) proposed a laser assisted bending with moving mechanical load for bending of large sized worksheets. Gisario et al. (2015 a) studied laser assisted bending of AISI 304 <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> of 1 mm thickness to obtain a large bend angle upto 140 ° with a small fillet radius of 2 mm. Gisario et al. (2015 b) studied laser assisted origami bending of the <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> for shaping the sheets into three dimensional items such as cubes and chairs. They found that the manufactured items have good precision, accuracy and aesthetic appearance.|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: The {{miniaturization}} {{of components}} {{plays an important}} role for manufacturing in electrical and electronic industries. Therefore, the joining technology of thin metal sheets has been strongly required. Laser welding with micro-beam and high-speed scanning is a promising solution in micro-welding, because it has high-potential advantages in welding heat sensitive components with precise control of heat input and minimal thermal distortion. Approach: In this study, the characteristics of laser micro-welding of thin <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> by using a single-mode CW fiber laser with high-speed scanning system were experimentally investigated. Results: It was clarified that the welding bead width and depth increased with increasing the scanning velocity under a constant energy density condition and high efficient welding was expected by using high-speed laser scanning with Galvano scanner. The utilization of shielding gas is very effective to obtain smooth fusion bead and the combination of micro beam spot and high-speed laser scanning made it possible to obtain good overlap welding of ultra-thin <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets.</b> Conclusion: A faster and high quality welding could be achieved by using a single-mode fiber laser with micro-beam and high-speed scanning...|$|E
40|$|Beside its {{conventional}} {{applications such}} as improving the wear resistance of machine parts and tools, plasma thermochemical treatment (PTT) can be successfully used as a method for surface modification to achieve specific surface properties. Surface electrical conductivity of austenitic <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets,</b> for example, can be significantly enhanced by means of plasma nitriding. Such materials are of interest for the use as bipolar plates of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC). In this regard a new PTT method based on a strip hollow cathode (SHC-PTT) has been developed as a cost-effective process for surface modification of thin metal strips in continuous operation. A laboratory-scale SHC-PTT device operating in stationary treatment mode has been realized and short-time plasma nitriding of EN 1. 4301 (AISI 304) austenitic <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> has been studied. The obtained nitrided layers were investigated using GDOES and XRD. Further, the interfacial contact resistance of the sheets was measured and the corrosion behaviour was investigated by means of electrochemical methods. The obtained results clearly demonstrate the high potential of the new SHC-PTT method for further development in terms of treating thin steel strips in continuous operation...|$|E
40|$|Achievement {{of sharp}} bending angles with small fillet radius on <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> by {{mechanical}} bending requires sophisticated bending device and troublesome operational procedures, which can involve expensive molds, huge presses and large loads. In addition, springback is always difficult to control, thus often leading to final parts with limited precision and accuracy. In contrast, laser-assisted bending of metals is an emerging technology, as it often allows to perform difficult and multifaceted manufacturing tasks with relatively small efforts. In the present work, laser-assisted bending of <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> to achieve sharp angles is thus investigated. First, bending trials were performed by combining laser irradiation with an auxiliary bending device {{triggered by a}} pneumatic actuator and based on kinematic of deformable quadrilaterals. Second, laser operational parameters, that is, scanning speed, power and number of passes, were varied to identify the most suitable processing settings. Bending angles and fillet radii were measured by coordinate measurement machine. Experimental data were elaborated by combined ANalysis Of Mean (ANOM) and ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA). Based on experimental findings, the best strategy to achieve an aircraft prototype from a stainless steel sheet was designed and implemented...|$|E
