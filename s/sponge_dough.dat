After 1920, when mixing machines became popular among bakers, rural bakers began to make more sponge doughs and city bakers more straight doughs, both replacing sourdough. By the 1930s, straight dough had mostly replaced <b>sponge</b> <b>dough,</b> and the terms [...] "French" [...] and [...] "Vienna" [...] breads were used less often.

Three variables; whole wheat flour (WHW), white flour (W) and W enriched with vitamin B₆ (WB₆) were tested. Stability of vitamin B₆ during bread making and storage of bread and flour was determined. Bread was prepared from {{the three types of}} flour under commercial and home conditions. Two methods, straight dough and <b>sponge</b> <b>dough</b> for bread making were compared under home conditions.

50|$|<b>Sponge</b> <b>doughs</b> {{were used}} before bread {{improvers}} were invented. Texture {{is partly a}} byproduct of the chemistry {{going on in the}} fermentation, which does several important things such as activate the different enzymes (protease and amylase) needed to leaven bread. Modern grain-harvesting practices have reduced the naturally occurring enzymes that grains had in former times, a result of no-longer-used grain-storage processes, so today small amounts of enzymes are routinely added to flour by manufacturers, often in the form of malted barley or sprouted grain.|$|R
50|$|The <b>sponge</b> and <b>dough</b> {{method is}} a two-step bread making process: {{in the first}} step a sponge is made and allowed to ferment {{for a period of}} time, and in the second step the sponge is added to the final dough's ingredients, {{creating}} the total formula. In this usage, synonyms for sponge are yeast starter or yeast pre-ferment. In French baking the <b>sponge</b> and <b>dough</b> method is known as levain-levure. The method is reminiscent of the sourdough or levain methods; however, the sponge is made from all fresh ingredients prior to being used in the final dough.|$|R

40|$|Twenty-two {{strains of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{isolated}} from tape-mash {{for the production}} of brem, a traditional rice wine from Bali, Indonesia, were divided into three groups (I, II, and III) based on the sequences of the rDNA spacer region and SUC 2 gene. DNA analyses suggested that the seventeen strains in groups II and III were taxonomically closer to baking strains than the five strains in group I. These differences were reflected in their leavening ability in dough with and without addition of 5 % sucrose, and their α-glucosidase activity, although most of the strains did not leaven dough with addition of 30 % sucrose. Strain S- 10 in group II showed a high rate of CO 2 production from <b>sponge</b> <b>dough</b> without addition of sugar and consumed fermentable sugar within 2. 5 h.

40|$|The yeast strain AK 46 was {{isolated}} from dough containing fermented cherry fruits and identified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The nucleotide {{sequence of the}} rDNA spacer region from this strain coincided with those from the yeasts used {{for the production of}} whisky, wine, and bread. In a comparison with six baking strains, strain AK 46 possessed less leavening ability in dough with and without addition of 5 % sucrose (based on the weight of flour) but a high ability in sweet dough containing 30 % sucrose. The activities of the two enzymes α-glucosidase and invertase, which are related to dough fermentation, were lower than those in the other strains. A baking test showed that strain AK 46 was applicable for breadmaking using the straight dough and <b>sponge</b> <b>dough</b> methods. Strain AK 46 carried only SUC 2, which is one of multiple genes encoding invertase, in contrast to the other baking strains, and its sequences diverged from those of the corresponding gene from a representative laboratory strain. Southern hybridization of genomic DNA, using the SUC 2 gene as the probe, readily discriminated strain AK 46 and other strains. These observations indicate that strain AK 46 is a wild strain possessing breadmaking properties. [URL]...|$|E

40|$|The {{genetic and}} {{phenotypic}} relationships among wheat quality predictors and <b>sponge</b> and <b>dough</b> bread making were evaluated {{in a population}} derived from a cross between an Australian cultivar ‘Chara’ and a Canadian cultivar ‘Glenlea’. The genetic correlation across sites for <b>sponge</b> and <b>dough</b> loaf volume was high; however, phenotypic correlations across sites for loaf volume were relatively low compared with rheological tests. The large difference between sites was most likely due to temperature differences during grain development reflected in {{a decrease in the}} percentage of unextractable polymeric protein and mixing time. Predictive tests (mixograph, extensograph, protein content and composition, micro-zeleny and flour viscosity) showed inconsistent and generally poor correlations with end-product performance (baking volume and slice area) at both sites, with no single parameter being effective as a predictor of end-product performance. The difference in the relationships between genetic and phenotypic correlations highlights the requirement to develop alternative methods of selection for breeders and bakers in order to maximise both genetic gain and predictive assessment of grain quality.

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Roles of {{lactic acid}} {{bacteria}} in flour pre-ferment and white bread were investigated. Volatile compounds produced by the organisms were identified using gas-liquid chromatography (GLC). Lactic acid bacteria were isolated from domestic commercial compressed yeast and active dry yeast. Numbers per gram of sample were 10 ⁸ to 10 ⁹ in compressed yeast and 10 ⁴ in active dry yeast. These {{lactic acid bacteria}} were identified by physiological and fermentation characteristics. Commercial yeast preparations were found to contain both homo- and heterofermentative lactobacilli, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides. Breads with or without lactic acid bacteria were prepared and analyzed by GLC for volatile compounds present. Lactic acid bacteria in compressed yeast were found to contribute {{at least to the}} production of acetic acid. Dough like-preparations for conversion to pre-ferments were inoculated with combinations of yeast and different types of lactic acid bacteria to investigate the behaviors of these organisms. The pre-ferments were considered useful flavor enhancers for bakery products. From results of GLC analyses, it was found that by adding certain lactic acid bacteria to the pre-ferment with yeast, the content of volatile compounds produced was changed dramatically. Pre-ferments inoculated with different lactic acid bacteria but without yeast also were examined for volatile compounds produced. Each strain produced characteristic metabolites in the pre-ferment. Lactococcus diacetylactis 18 - 16, which produced an elevated amount of diacetyl in the pre-ferment without yeast, did not produce a significant amount of the compound in pre-ferment with yeast. Cells of the bacterium added directly to <b>sponge</b> <b>dough</b> of bread increased the concentrations of acetoin and acetic acid present, but not diacetyl. Since the column packing material used in this study was found to be very suitable for the analysis of volatile compounds, direct injection of cultures on GLC column was carried out to determine the compounds produced by Leuconostoc strains. Most citrate-utilizing strains of Leuconostoc did not produce diacetyl or acetoin in modified MRS or acidified milk cultures, but did in citrate solutions. When the citrate-utilizing strains did produce diacetyl and acetoin, the amounts of ethanol produced by them were always small...|$|E

It appears that protein composition may be the key to understanding S&D quality, as the glutenin Glu D 1 5 + 10 subunit contributed to the highest LVs.

40|$|While {{the genetic}} control of wheat {{processing}} {{characteristics such as}} dough rheology is well understood, limited information is available concerning the genetic control of baking parameters, particularly <b>sponge</b> and <b>dough</b> (S 2 ̆ 6 D) baking. In this study, a quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis was performed using a population of doubled haploid lines derived from a cross between Australian cultivars Kukri × Janz grown at sites across different Australian wheat production zones (Queensland in 2001 and 2002 and Southern and Northern New South Wales in 2003) {{in order to examine}} the genetic control of protein content, protein expression, <b>dough</b> rheology and <b>sponge</b> and <b>dough</b> baking performance. The study highlighted the inconsistent genetic control of protein content across the test sites, with only two loci (3 A and 7 A) showing QTL at three of the five sites. Dough rheology QTL were highly consistent across the 5 sites, with major effects associated with the Glu-B 1 and Glu-D 1 loci. The Glu-D 1 5 + 10 allele had consistent effects on S 2 ̆ 6 D properties across sites; however, there was no evidence for a positive effect of the high dough strength Glu-B 1 -al allele at Glu-B 1. A second locus on 5 D had positive effects on S 2 ̆ 6 D baking at three of five sites. This study demonstrated that dough rheology measurements were poor predictors of S 2 ̆ 6 D quality. In the absence of robust predictive tests, high heritability values for S 2 ̆ 6 D demonstrate that direct selection is the current best option for achieving genetic gain in this product category...|$|R
40|$|Australia exports {{seventy-five percent}} of the wheat {{produced}} annually and the Asian region is an important export market for Australian wheat. These markets require suitable quality grain for use in wheat-based products, so the understanding of wheat end products from an Asian consumer {{point of view is}} important. The major wheat quality requirements for char siew bao, a Chinese Guandong-style steamed bun were determined. The research 1) developed laboratory methods for the production and assessment of char siew bao using a scoring system 2) optimized the new methods and compared the new methods with a traditional method and 3) used the new validated methods in an investigation of the role of soft wheat quality on char siew bao. A <b>sponge</b> and <b>dough</b> method with one hour fermentation time was developed to establish a simplified laboratory method for char siew bao production. The screening experiments and response surface methodology experiments showed that water addition, sugar, and sponge mixing time were responsible for sixty-nine percent of the variation in total score.

Consumers are focused on adding fiber and whole grains to be healthy and want the benefits of whole grain with the taste and appearance of refined flour. A review of current commercial whole wheat flour in the marketplace indicated many options for food processors to use. However, many of these options required processing changes and added ingredients to provide the consumer with a quality product. A milling and baking study was done to compare commercially and experimentally milled whole wheat flours from both white and red wheat varieties. Both white and red wheat varieties were kept identity preserved. Experimental milling was done with a hammer mill and a roll stand to closely replicate the commercial milling process. Baking was done using a <b>sponge</b> and <b>dough</b> method to closely replicate commercial baking conditions. The results showed both particle size and wheat variety impact bake performance of whole wheat flour. The most significant impact appeared to be dependent on the variety of wheat being milled. The milling process also had an impact. As particle size decreased, bake functionality improved. However, some decreased functionality was seen when particle size became very fine. It was concluded that additional work on a commercial flour mill needed to be done to determine if an optimal particle size for milling whole wheat flour exists. Experimental milling equipment was not adequate enough to replicate particle size distributions of commercial whole wheat mills...|$|R
40|$|Coeliac disease (CD) is {{a common}} lifelong {{disorder}} with small bowel malabsorption and gluten intolerance. The only effective treatment for CD is a strict lifelong renunciation of gluten-containing foods. Currently, the cereal products {{designed to meet the}} requirements of CD patients, especially gluten-free bread, are scarce, of low quality and poor flavor. Therefore, preparation of high quality and affordable bread for coeliac patients was the main objective of this study. Three kinds of gluten-free bread were prepared, in which wheat flour was substituted with rice and corn flour at a ratio of 5 : 1, respectively. Gluten was substituted using different hydrocolloids: 1 % xanthan and 1 % carrageenan (Mix A), GFB A; 1 % xanthan and 1 % pectin (Mix B), GFB B; and 1 % carrageenan and 1 % pectin (Mix C), GFB C. These three types of bread were compared to control bread produced from wheat flour (WB). <b>Sponge</b> and <b>dough</b> method with some modifications was used to produce the bread samples with a developed formula (0. 8 % yeast, 4. 0 % sugar, 2 % salt, 7. 0 % shortening, 2. 0 % non-fat dry milk, and 1 % sodium stearoyl lactylate (SSL)). Determination of the chemical composition, rheological properties and physical characteristics, as well as sensory evaluation of the bread samples, was undertaken. Results showed that the moisture content of WB bread (control) was significantly lower than that of all types of gluten-free bread, and {{there was no significant difference}} in ash, protein, and lipid contents among the gluten-free bread samples.

The effects of chitosan calcium phosphate amount on density, porosity, microstructure, chemical composition and mechanical properties on the composites {{and effects of}} porosifier contents, hydroxyapatite content of the slurry and sintering temperature on density, porosity and microstructure of the porous ceramic samples were investigated. SEM was used for microstructural analysis, XRD and FTIR were used for chemical analysis, Archimedes method was used for investigating physical properties and compression test for investigating mechanical properties. In this study low molecular weight chitosan, -tricalciumphosphate, hydroxyapatite and hydroxyapatite whisker have been used. For composites freeze drying technique and for the porous bodies dry pressing, polymer <b>sponge</b> method and <b>dough</b> method have been used. The densities of the composites prepared by using chitosan as the matrix and hydroxyapatite, hydroxyapatite whisker, and B-tricalciumphosphate as reinforcement increased and the porosities decreased {{with the increase in}} the ceramic content. The modulus of elasticity and the yield stress generally increased with the increasing ceramic content except for the chitosan/-tricalciumphosphate composites. The densities and porosities of the composite structures varied in the range of 0. 059 - 0. 29 g/cm 3 and 96 - 88 % respectively. The elastic moduli of the composites varied in a range of 4. 45 - 10. 09 MPa and yield stress varied in a range of 0. 14 - 0. 34 Mpa due to the change in the ceramic weight%. Changing the ceramic weight% also had influence on the microstructure. Generally with increasing ceramic content the pore sizes decreased. The pore sizes varied in a range between 100 - 250, 100 - 400 and 100 - 200 for chitosan/hydroxapatite, Chitosan/-TCP/Hydroxyapatite and chitosan/HA whisker composites respectively. FTIR and XRD analysis showed that the composite structures contained original constituents, no new chemical compounds were formed the production process had not affected crystallinity of ceramic phases. The densities of the porous ceramic bodies decreased and the porosities increased with the increasing porosifier content at the porous ceramics prepared by dough method and dry pressing method. The porosity and density values of porous hydroxyapatite samples changed in range of 34 - 72 % and 2. 03 to 0. 87 g/cm 3.
