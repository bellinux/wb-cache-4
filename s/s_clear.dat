After the clearing process the scattering contribution in the sample can be greatly reduced and made almost negligible while the absorption contribution cannot be eliminated completely. When trying to reconstruct the fluorescence distribution within the sample under investigation, this contribution affects the reconstructions and leads, inevitably, to image artifacts and quantification errors [...] While absorption could be reduced further with a permanence of weeks or months in the clearing media, this will lead to progressive loss of fluorescence and to an unrealistically long sample processing time.

On the other hand, Davidson's analysis of the current state of affairs requires more than mere "plumbing" and addresses the root causes of the crises. Finally, with reference to the way Keynes once defended his proposal against criticisms, the authors of this paper conclude that the current Keynes-Post Keynesian proposal is not only relevant but also possible today.
