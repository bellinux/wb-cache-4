5|$|As a child, {{director}} Pete Docter relocated {{with his}} family to Denmark when his father moved to study the music of Carl Nielsen. While his sisters had an easy time adjusting to the new surroundings, Docter felt he was judged constantly by peers. While other kids were interested in sports, Docter <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> drawing, a hobby that eventually led him to animation. His social anxiety ended by high school.|$|E
5|$|A {{ceremony}} is held each October 13 at the outfield wall in Oakland {{to listen to}} a taped broadcast of the final game of the 1960 World Series. The tradition was started by Squirrel Hill resident Saul Finkelstein, who at 1:05 pm on October 13, 1985, <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> {{at the base of the}} flagpole and listened to the NBC radio broadcast of Chuck Thompson and Jack Quinlan. Finkelstein continued the tradition for eight more years, until word spread and other people began attending in 1993. On October 13, 2000—the game's 40th anniversary—over 600people attended to listen to the broadcast, including Mazeroski himself. For the 50th anniversary, on October 13, 2010, a plaque honoring Mazeroski was dedicated and more than 1,000 attended the broadcast, including Mazeroski and several other former Pirates.|$|E
25|$|Co-defendants Andy Wright, Eugene Williams, and Ozie Powell all {{testified that}} they did not see any women on the train. Olen Montgomery testified that he <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> on the train and did not know of any of the {{referenced}} events. The jury quickly convicted Patterson and recommended death by electric chair.|$|E

25|$|In {{his great}} career Walter Payton rushed for an all-time career record 16,726 yards. The Bears earned a Divisional Playoff rematch with Redskins at Soldier Field. The Bears jumped {{out to a}} 14–0 lead early on only to see the Redskins storm {{back and take a}} 21–17 lead late in the game. As time was winding down on the season and Payton's career, the Bears need to score a {{touchdown}} late. The ball was in the hands of Payton who tried to extend his career, but on fourth down he was shoved out of bounds one yard short of the first down marker allowing the Redskins to run the clock out. Payton watched the rest of the game as he <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> on the bench.|$|E
25|$|Manoah {{was told}} by his wife what happened, and Manoah entreated God to let the man of God come again and teach them what to do. God heeded Manoah and sent the angel to the woman as she <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> in the field. Manoah's wife ran and told Manoah, and he {{followed}} her to the angel, and asked him whether {{he was the one}} who had spoken to his wife, and he said that he was. Manoah asked the angel how they should raise the child, and the angel told him that they should do what he had told Manoah's wife: She was not to eat any product of the grapevine, drink wine or strong drink, or eat any unclean thing.|$|E
500|$|In summer 1356, Louis invaded Venetian territories {{without a}} formal {{declaration}} of war. He laid siege to Treviso on 27 July. A local nobleman, Giuliano Baldachino, noticed that Louis <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> while writing his {{letters on the}} banks of Sile River on each morning. Baldachino proposed the Venetians to assassinate him in exchange for 12,000 golden florins and Castelfranco Veneto, but they refused his offer because he did not share the details of his plans with them. Louis returned to Buda in the autumn, but his troops continued the siege. Pope Innocent VI urged the Venetians to make a peace with Hungary. The pope made Louis the [...] "standard-bearer of the Church" [...] and granted him a three-year tithe to fight against Francesco II Ordelaffi and other rebellious lords in the Papal States. Louis sent an army under Nicholas Lackfi's command to support the pope's troops in Italy.|$|E

2500|$|In a {{homage to}} Cage's dance work, the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company in July 2012 [...] "{{performed}} an engrossing piece called 'Story/Time'.

Dancers from Jones's company performed as [...] read." ...|$|E
2500|$|Their {{household}} records witness {{incidents that}} imply a comfortable, even humorous, relationship. Each year on Easter Monday, Edward let Eleanor's ladies trap {{him in his}} bed and paid them a token ransom so {{he could go to}} her bedroom on the first day after Lent; so important was this custom to him that in 1291, on the first Easter Monday after Eleanor's death, he gave her ladies the money he would have given them had she been alive. [...] Edward disliked ceremonies and in 1290 refused to attend the marriage of Earl Marshal Roger Bigod, 5th Earl of Norfolk; Eleanor thoughtfully (or resignedly) paid minstrels to play for him while he <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> during the wedding.|$|E
2500|$|On 7 February 2002 Lawlor was {{released}} from jail to make a Dáil appearance during which he ignored unprecedented all-party calls for his resignation. In what the Irish Independent described as [...] "one of the most sensational days in the House", Lawlor {{was released}} temporarily by the High Court to mount his own defence during an hour-long debate. Taken into Leinster House in a prison van, Lawlor <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> {{at the rear of}} the Chamber while the five party leaders, in turn, called on him to step down. Instead Lawlor made an aggressive defence of his own position during a 20-minute speech while making no reference at all to the unprecedented joint motion.|$|E

2500|$|The Provisional IRA {{also carried}} out attacks in other {{countries}} such as West Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands, where British soldiers were based. Between 1979 and 1990, eight unarmed soldiers and six civilians died in these attacks, including the British Ambassador to the Netherlands Sir Richard Sykes and his valet, Karel Straub. On one occasion, the IRA shot dead two Australian tourists in the Netherlands, claiming its members mistook them for off-duty British soldiers. On another occasion an IRA gunman shot dead Heidi Hazell, a German woman, as she <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> in her car. She was parked near a British Army married quarter in Unna. They claimed she had been shot [...] "in the belief {{that she was a}} member of the British Army garrison at Dortmund". Her husband was a British Army staff sergeant. Hans Engelhard, West Germany's Justice Minister called it [...] "the insane act of a blind fanatic." ...|$|E
2500|$|Walcott and {{his family}} {{returned}} to the quarry each summer until 1913, using dynamite as surface collection dried up. During this time, his wife died in a train crash and his eldest son died of tubercolosis. He considered his next trip, in 1917, to have [...] "practically exhausted" [...] the quarry, with 1300kg of material being collected that year. He returned to take additional collections, mainly from talus material, in 1919, 1921, and 1924, amassing a total of 65,000 fossil specimens over 30,000 slabs. During these years, he made further preliminary descriptions of the less glamorous sponges and algae. He photographed and clearly intended to describe many further taxa, many of which <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> with their photograph in a Smithsonian drawer for decades after Walcott's death. Unfortunately, administrative duties became a growing burden on Walcott's time, and the Burgess took {{a back seat to}} the completion of his attempts to document the stratigraphy of the southern Rockies, an extensive work which he did not live to see published.|$|E
60|$|It was night, and I <b>sat</b> <b>alone</b> in my chamber, waiting {{the moment}} when, {{as it was}} agreed, Charmion should summon me to pass down to Cleopatra. I <b>sat</b> <b>alone,</b> and there before me lay the dagger that was to pierce her. It was long and keen, and the handle was formed of a sphinx of solid gold. I <b>sat</b> <b>alone,</b> {{questioning}} the future, but no answer came. At length I looked up, and Charmion stood before me--Charmion, no longer gay and bright, but pale of face and hollow-eyed.|$|E
60|$|Magdalen {{went back}} to the kitchen regions. After {{communicating}} the admiral's order to the servant whose special duty it was to attend to the fires, she returned to the pantry, and, gently closing the door, <b>sat</b> down <b>alone</b> to think.|$|R

60|$|She <b>sat</b> down <b>alone</b> in {{the parlor}} and drew a long breath of relief. Captain Wragge's {{calculations}} had not deceived him. The evidence of her own senses had at last conquered the housekeeper's incredulity, and had literally forced her into the opposite extreme of belief.|$|R
60|$|It {{made the}} little bride quite sad {{to think she}} could do nothing to show her love for the old man's heart. She used {{to think about it}} as she <b>sat</b> all <b>alone</b> during the long days, for her husband was almost always out.|$|R
