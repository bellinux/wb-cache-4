5|$|From September 2 to September 3, large waves, some {{as high as}} , {{impacted}} beaches throughout southern California, with Los Angeles and Orange Counties experiencing growing breakers, and Cabrillo Beach experiencing riptides for {{two days}} straight. Due to the Labor Day beach turnout, many reports of rescuing swimmers who were swept up by waves caused by the hurricane were received. On September 2, forty-seven swimmers in Zuma Beach had to be rescued despite warnings {{to stay out of}} deep water, and an additional 261 rescues were reported in Newport. More rescues were reported the next day, although no exact total from the second day is known. At the El Morro Beach Trailer Park near Laguna Beach, a group of <b>sundecks</b> estimated at $5,000(1968USD) were ripped from their supports by rough seas. Long Beach, in terms of damage, was particularly hit hard by Liza, with debris and sea foam from the heavy surf clogging storm drains. A group of tidal pools formed along an area of the beach, draining out from a parking lot on 72nd Street onto Ocean Boulevard, resulting in flooding that closed a section of the boulevard between 68th Place and 72nd Place to traffic. Various flower gardens were also reported to have been swamped by the flooding, but no damage to housing was reported. The weakened properties in West Newport Beach also sustained no additional damage.|$|R

5000|$|Between 1913 and 1936 Waterhouse {{had built}} on half an acre (0.2 hectares) of land at 17 McIntosh Street, Gordon {{a house and}} garden called Eryldene after his wife's birthplace in Scotland. The Waterhouses with their son Gordon moved into the house in 1914. The garden {{eventually}} doubled in size; in 1921 it incorporated the block facing the street behind. The house and the garden buildings were designed and built by William Hardy Wilson in a Georgian Colonial Revival style modelled on early buildings in Sydney and Hobart, but also on Indian bungalows of the same period. [...] House and garden were seen as a unit in the Arts and Crafts manner, though the house is not an Arts and Crafts house and the garden, designed by Waterhouse, is more symmetrical and formal than the [...] "sinuous gravel paths, squiggly beds, standard roses and general fussiness" [...] of the neighbouring Arts and Crafts gardens. Extending the axes of the house were garden [...] "rooms" [...] set {{against a background of}} existing eucalypts. Waterhouse illustrated this in an article in The Home in 1923. Eryldene became [...] "a touchstone for the Sydney gardens {{of the first half of}} the twentieth century." [...] Waterhouse felt that shrubs, camellias especially, lent [...] "great personality" [...] to a garden in a way which had been neglected in Australia. Eventually his garden came to contain over 700 camellia varieties — the largest private collection in Sydney — completely altering its original character. At a time of enormous expansion of gardens and housing on the North Shore, Eryldene and its plantings were imitated all over Sydney (and in many issues of The Home, until the magazine's attention was drawn in the Thirties to Spanish cloisters and Modernist <b>sundecks).</b> Nearly a century later, the suburbs of Gordon, Killara, Pymble and Turramurra between May and August present an exceptional display of camellias in every form. The Melbourne suburbs of Ivanhoe and Heidelberg show something similar.|$|R

She entered service in the Mediterranean Sea as the second former Birka Line ship in the Louis Cruise Lines fleet, after MS Princesa Marissa, the former MS Prinsessan/Finnhansa. After the sale she was registered in Valletta, Malta. She changed flags in late 2006.

2500|$|Norwegian Star has {{a maximum}} capacityassuming double occupancyof 2,348passengers. Of Norwegian Stars 1,176cabins, 70percent had {{views of the}} ocean. Unusual, for a cruise ship, are its twin , three-bedroom, suites {{situated}} atop the ship complete with private garden and <b>sundeck.</b> When built, Norwegian Star {{was also one of}} the few cruise ships built without a casino, something that was prohibited by Hawaiian law; a [...] casino was added in 2005 when she was repositioned. Because the ship was ordered by Star Cruises and to be based out of Singapore, the decor and layout of Norwegian Star was meant to appeal to Asian and Australian passenger rather than Americans where she was ultimately based. The Norwegian Star has a total of 10different restaurants on board, which emphasizes NCL's [...] "Freestyle Cruising" [...] concept, allowing passengers to dine where and when they choose.|$|E
2500|$|Finnjets {{estimated}} {{fuel consumption}} for the 22-hour travel time was 300tonnes of fuel; approx 350,000litres total or 16,000litres per hour. [...] Initially Finnjet {{was not a}} very profitable ship and after only a few years of service there were rumours that she would be sold. The ship had been ordered in the same year as the beginning of the 1973 oil crisis, which reached its peak {{around the time of the}} ship's launch. Yet another huge leap of the oil price occurred near the turn of the decade. To increase her profitability, the ship was converted to a combined diesel-electric and gas propulsion with the addition of diesel-electric generators in 1981 in Amsterdamse Droogdok Maatschappij, Amsterdam. The change allowed to operate the ship at slower speeds, using cheaper fuel during the winter months. On the way to the shipyard she became the largest ship to have passed through the Kiel Canal at that time. A year later 75% of Finnjets shares were sold to Effoa (one of the owners of Silja Line), and Finnjet Line was established as a joint venture of Finnlines and Effoa to operate the Finnjet. Starting from November 1985, Finnjet made 24-hour (later 22-hour) backtracking cruises from Helsinki during the winter season. The final batch of these cruises in October–December 1995 included a short stop in Tallinn. In January 1986 another major renovation was carried out at Wärtsilä Helsinki, with new Commodore-class cabins added in place of the old <b>sundeck.</b> Shortly after the refit the Denmark-based DFDS made an offer to buy the Finnjet, but the offer was refused. Instead, in June of the same year Finnlines sold their remaining shares of the Finnjet to Effoa. In the beginning of 1987 the ship was painted in Silja Line's colors and incorporated in Silja's fleet. However, the technical responsibility for operating the Finnjet remained with Finnlines until May 1989 (this was of little consequence as Finnlines was almost entirely owned by Effoa at the time).|$|E
