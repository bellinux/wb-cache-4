This research analyses the process that has shaped residential retrofit policies in New Zealand and Chile; the first, a developed country with a long history of residential energy efficiency; the second, a developing country that is in the first stages of the retrofit policy process. Different theoretical approaches to residential energy efficiency were used, specifically, approaches within economic and behavioural economics theory, such as barriers theory, the rebound effect theory and co-benefits theory. A particular emphasis was given to co-benefits theory. The research found that in both Chile and New Zealand the retrofit policy process depends on critical contextual factors (e. g. global oil shocks, global financial crisis, energy <b>security</b> <b>issues,</b> electricity <b>sector</b> reforms and climate change mitigation policy) which trigger a sense of political urgency to address these factors. Local entities and the academic world have also contributed to shape retrofit policies. The multiple co-benefits of residential retrofit lead to a more resilient policy when governments and political will change. In the future, the co-benefits of health, fuel-poverty, fuel affordability, energy security and thermal comfort are likely to provide resilience to retrofit policies in Chile and New Zealand...|$|R
40|$|Conceptions of {{agricultural}} water security are conditioned by larger understandings of being and reality. It {{is still unclear}} what such understandings mean for perspectives on water security in general and on causes and solutions related to perceived water security risks and problems in agricultural sector in particular. Based on a systematic literature review, three conceptualizations of water security, related to different paradigms, are presented. Also the consequences of such conceptualizations for determining research objectives, research activities, and research outcomes on agricultural water security are discussed. The results showed that agricultural water security from a positivist paradigm referred to tangible and measurable water-related hazards and threats, such as floods and droughts, pollution, and so forth. A constructivist approach to agricultural water security, constituted by a process of interaction and negotiation, pointed at perceptions of water security of farmers and other stakeholders involved in agricultural sector. A critical approach to agricultural water security focused on the processes of securing vulnerable farmers and others from wider political, social, and natural impediments to sufficient water supplies. The conclusions of the study suggest that paradigms, underlying approaches should be expressed, clarified, and related {{to one another in}} order to find optimal and complementary ways to study water <b>security</b> <b>issues</b> in agricultural <b>sector.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this study}} is to analyse if the UN today {{constructs}} the water <b>issue</b> as a <b>security</b> <b>issue</b> and to argue about in which way the organization in that case does so alternatively why it can be said that the UN doesn’t construct the water <b>issue</b> as a <b>security</b> <b>issue.</b> In order to reach this purpose the following questions will be answered: •Does the UN construct the water <b>issue</b> as a <b>security</b> <b>issue</b> today? -If yes, in which way? -If no, why can it be said that the organisation doesn’t? The methods used are qualitative literature studies of policy documents on water from the UN. The focus is to analyze the ideas about water and to apply my theory on the concept of security, which is Barry Buzan’s framework on security, to these ideas. The main results showed that the UN strongly constructs the water issue as an environmental <b>security</b> <b>issue</b> for environments and species and in relatively strong terms also constructs it as an environmental <b>security</b> <b>issue</b> for civilisations. In rare cases the organisation constructs it as a societal <b>security</b> <b>issue,</b> but the UN doesn’t construct the water issue as a military, political or economic <b>security</b> <b>issue...</b>|$|R
