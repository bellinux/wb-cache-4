500|$|In 2013, Singer {{stated that}} Superman Returns {{was made for}} [...] "Perhaps more of a female audience. It wasn't what it needed to be, I guess." [...] Singer stated {{that he would have}} cut about the first quarter off of the film and started it with [...] "the jet {{disaster}} sequence or <b>something.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have grabbed the audience a little more quickly. I don't know what would have helped. Probably nothing. If I could go again, I would do an origin. I would reboot it." ...|$|E
500|$|Kills {{described}} {{working with}} will.i.am, [...] " [...] it's almost difficult having a normal {{conversation with him}} because he's firing out ideas all the time. [...] His entire life revolves around creativity, and that's <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> really relate to." [...] Kierszenbaum praised Kills' work ethic during the recording sessions, stating that she would focus simultaneously on the melodic and lyrical structure of song, {{as well as its}} soundscape. He {{went on to say that}} she [...] "influenced the timbre of the sound" [...] and assisted the production as if [...] "she's making a movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Jolie was {{involved}} in a well-publicized Hollywood scandal when she was accused of having caused the 2005 divorce of actors Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. She {{had fallen in love with}} Pitt during filming of Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), but dismissed allegations of an affair, saying, [...] "To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife." [...] Jolie and Pitt did not publicly comment on the nature of their relationship until January 2006, when she confirmed that she was pregnant with his child.|$|E

60|$|She {{looks so}} sweet as she sleeps, {{but she is}} paler than is her wont, {{and there is a}} drawn, haggard look under her eyes which I do not like. I fear she is {{fretting}} about <b>something.</b> <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> find out what it is.|$|R
60|$|The words {{reminded}} me of <b>something,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not recall what it was. The strange fear that was on me deepened. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not speak.|$|R
500|$|During the tour, filmmaker Baz Luhrmann {{commissioned}} Radiohead {{to write}} a song for his upcoming film Romeo + Juliet and gave them the final 30 minutes of the film. Yorke said: [...] "When we saw the scene in which Claire Danes holds the Colt [...]45 against her head, we started working on the song immediately." [...] Soon afterwards, the band wrote and recorded [...] "Exit Music (For a Film)"; the track plays over the film's end credits but was excluded from the soundtrack album at the band's request. The song helped shape {{the direction of the}} rest of the album; Yorke said it [...] "was the first performance we'd ever recorded where every note of it made my head spin—something I was proud of, <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> turn up really, really loud and not wince at any moment." ...|$|E
500|$|During the Republican presidential {{primaries}} of 2016, {{opponents of}} Trump's candidacy used Trump University to criticize him. Mitt Romney said in early March: [...] "Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as {{a degree from}} Trump University." [...] Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio raised the subject during televised debates in February and March. One debate moderator, Megyn Kelly of Fox News, pursued the issue at length. Trump responded that Trump University was [...] "a small business" [...] and student evaluations were overwhelmingly positive. He said lawsuits were a routine part of business and that he wins most of them. Of one of the class action suits he said: [...] "It's <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have settled many times. I could settle it right now for very little money, but I don't {{want to do it}} out of principle." [...] Hillary Clinton used the Trump University allegations against Trump in speeches and campaign ads.|$|E
500|$|Originally it wasn't {{going to}} have {{anything}} to do with that, but people were looking through my photo albums this year. My father and I had made some photo albums together of his relatives and different people in the family. A couple people saw [...] and they were like, 'This is amazing that you have this.' I guess everybody was like, 'How would you feel about this type of concept ?' So I guess I thought if someone's going to do it might as well be me. The story line [...] is about an interracial couple. It's sort of Romeo and Juliet but it's set in the '60s and they're kind of torn apart. It's about their struggle and I'm sort of the narrator. I don't want to give too much away about it, but it's nice. <b>Something</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> relate to, being the product of an interracial union, though [...] did not wind up happily ever after standing in church together.|$|E

500|$|Patti Smith {{had a great}} {{influence}} on Iyall. [...] " [...] someone who was both a rock singer and a poet," [...] she said. [...] "She combined things I was interested in. Plus, she wasn't a trumped-up sex symbol. She was herself on stage. That appealed to me. It looked like <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do. You didn't have to look {{like all the other}} singers." [...] Iyall was highly critical of the music of the day and found inspiration in other mediums. [...] "I hate rock and roll right now. It's turned into some new kind of stupid [...] religion... I'd rather listen to Billie Holiday, maybe Tom Waits. [...] Actually, I'll admit I like The Bangles – they have a great sound. But I'd just as soon read novels or paint pictures as listen to music. I love language – plain speech, used in an enigmatic, subliminal way; I'm not [...] much tied to the literal." ...|$|E
500|$|Nash, {{whose father}} {{was born in the}} Tottenham {{district}} of London, is a lifelong Tottenham Hotspur supporter, and has expressed interest in owning a minority stake in the club. [...] "I'd like to be an owner. It's <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do {{for the rest of my}} life after my little window of popularity dies", he said in an interview with The New York Times. Nash added, [...] "I've been a passionate supporter all my life. My parents are from north London and so it's not like I'm some Yank who wants to make a profit out of football. I don't care about making money. I just want to see Spurs succeed and, if I can help, that's great." [...] However, he said any participation in Spurs would come after his basketball career is over, and he has had only [...] "casual contact" [...] with chairman Daniel Levy and former director of football Damien Comolli. Nash is also a fan of Spain's FC Barcelona, and Brazilian team Sport Club Corinthians Paulista, which his former Suns teammate Leandro Barbosa supports. When Barbosa visited Corinthians in 2007, the club gave him a shirt with Nash's name and jersey number.|$|E
500|$|Some have {{suggested}} that Plath had not intended to kill herself. That morning, she asked her downstairs neighbor, a Mr.Thomas, what time he would be leaving. She also left a note reading [...] "Call Dr.Horder," [...] including the doctor's phone number. Therefore, it is argued Plath turned on the gas {{at a time when}} Mr.Thomas {{would have been able to}} see the note. However, in her biography Giving Up: The Last Days of SylviaPlath, Plath's best friend, Jillian Becker wrote, [...] "According to Mr.Goodchild, a police officer attached to the coroner's office... had thrust her head far into the gas oven... had really meant to die." [...] Dr.Horder also believed her intention was clear. He stated that [...] "No one who saw the care with which the kitchen was prepared could have interpreted her action as anything but an irrational compulsion." [...] Plath had described the quality of her despair as [...] "owl's talons clenching my heart." [...] In his 1971 book on suicide, friend and critic Al Alvarez claimed that Plath's suicide was an unanswered cry for help, and spoke, in a BBC interview in March2000, about his failure to recognize Plath's depression, saying he regretted his inability to offer her emotional support: [...] "I failed her on that level. I was thirtyyears old and stupid. What did I know about chronic clinical depression? [...] She kind of needed someone to take care of her. And that was not <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{old woman}} {{looked up and}} saw me. [...] "Si, Senor Inglese," [...] she said with a ghastly smile, [...] "viruela, viruela!" [...] and she went on gabbling <b>something</b> which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not understand.|$|R
60|$|I heard {{a little}} exclamation of {{surprise}} from Xodar, {{followed by a}} grim laugh. The boy laughed too and said <b>something</b> which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not catch for the whistling of the wind of our awful speed.|$|R
60|$|I {{should have}} said when he clapped on his topper. Thank you. I ought to have said {{something}} about an old hat or <b>something.</b> No. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have said. Looks as good as new now. See his phiz then.|$|R
500|$|The Daily Star quoted Rowland on {{the theme}} of the song. She said [...] "I hope to see women singing the song like they're in charge. It's {{important}} to know that we are commanders who have the power to shape our own destiny." [...] Love explained to Rap-Up magazine his view of the song, [...] "It's just such an aggressive record, it's a club record, it's a worldwide international record. She's stretching her legs out and she's showing her true vocal ability, she's like the queen of the night on this record." [...] Then during the video shoot of the song Rowland said [...] "I feel like I've finally come into my own," [...] a reference to the exploration of a new musical sound. [...] "With the sound of dance music getting embraced more, I'm very excited, seeing how fans have been responding to the music. Dance music is more of a European thing, but I've been looking on Twitter and seeing fans (in different parts of the country) talking about playing 'Commander'." [...] She said working with Guetta was [...] "amazing" [...] because it is [...] "effortless" [...] and she feels a great sense of [...] "chemistry" [...] when working with him. Rowland felt she was trying something different: [...] "In this generation and this day and time, no one is putting soul in dance music... no pop artist. I thought maybe that was <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> try. And then it works." [...] In an interview for MSN Xin Rowland admitted the song was [...] "darker" [...] than her previous material but still fun. [...] "I just thought it'd be so much fun to be a commander of course. It's just a statement for me definitely, coming out on my own, filling my space. I'm happy being a commander".|$|E
2500|$|Delaney felt an {{immediate}} affinity with this [...] "multitude {{of people of}} all races – spending every night {{of their lives in}} parks and cafes" [...] surviving on next to nothing. Their courage and shared camaraderie inspired him to feel that [...] "somehow, someway there was <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> manage if only with some stronger force of will I could find the courage to surmount the terror and fear of this immense city and accept everything insofar as possible with some calm and determination".|$|E
2500|$|After obtaining his BA, Jackman {{completed}} the one-year course [...] "The Journey" [...] at the Actors' Centre in Sydney. About studying acting full-time, he stated, [...] "It wasn't until I was 22 that I {{ever thought about}} my hobby being <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make a living out of. As a boy, I'd always {{had an interest in}} theatre. But the idea at my school was that drama and music were to round out the man. It wasn't what one did for a living. I got over that. I found the courage to stand up and say, 'I want to do it'." [...] After completing [...] "The Journey", he was offered a role on the popular soap opera Neighbours but turned it down to attend the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts of Edith Cowan University in Perth, Western Australia, from which he graduated in 1994.|$|E
60|$|When my {{eyes opened}} I knew I had been awakened by <b>something,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not tell what. I listened. Cubby was {{as quiet as}} a mouse, and his very quiet and the alert way he held his ears gave me a vague alarm. He had heard <b>something.</b> <b>I</b> thought of the old hunter's return, yet this did not reassure me.|$|R
60|$|Audrey {{had taken}} from me <b>something</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not recover--poetry was as near as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get to a {{definition}} of it. Yes, poetry.

60|$|A {{murmur of}} {{approval}} {{came from the}} populace. Pietro winced, but Marco {{turned to him and}} said <b>something</b> which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not hear; but I saw the glance of deep affection, and the answering smile of Pietro as he seemed to take courage.|$|R
2500|$|On 18 January 2016, it was {{announced}} that Kemp had agreed to reprise his role for a few episodes. His return coincided with Windsor's final appearance as Grant's mother Peggy. Grant was also reunited with Phil, Sharon and Kathy. Of his return, Kemp commented, [...] "When I was approached about returning to EastEnders for Barbara's final episodes, it was <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not turn down. Barbara is a very close friend so when I learned of the storyline, it felt right that the Mitchell brothers are reunited with their mother for the last time. I am really looking forward to going back to EastEnders and filming what are set to be some classic EastEnders episodes." [...] Kemp returned to filming on 6 April 2016. Later, it {{was announced}} that Kemp would film a further three weeks, and he resumed filming on 6 June 2016 and finished on 26 June 2016.|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{following}} the incident, Timberlake sounded unapologetic for his actions, telling Access Hollywood, [...] "Hey man, we love giving you all {{something to talk}} about." [...] Timberlake released a statement saying [...] "I am sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl. It was not intentional and is regrettable." [...] However, Timberlake was not required to film a video apology as Jackson was. Timberlake also addressed the incident at the Grammy Awards the following week, which Jackson was banned from attending after being scheduled as a presenter, saying [...] "I know it's been a rough week on everybody. What occurred was unintentional, completely regrettable and I apologize if you guys are offended." [...] Timberlake gave an additional interview at the Grammy event and stated, [...] "All I could say was, 'Oh, my God. Oh, my God,'" [...] Timberlake said. [...] "I looked at her. They brought a towel up on stage. They covered her up. I was completely embarrassed and just walked off the stage as quickly as I could. I'm frustrated at the whole situation. I'm frustrated that my character is being questioned. And {{the fact of the}} matter is, you know, I've had a good year, a really good year, especially with my music." [...] Timberlake later declared, [...] "It was something that went wrong. Then I felt like, I'm going to show everyone that this was something that didn't affect me, and I'm going to show up at the Grammys." [...] He later said he was unable to attend most of the halftime rehearsals due to being on tour in Spain, having only one day to rehearse. While promoting his sophomore album FutureSex/LoveSounds over two years later, Timberlake expressed regret for his behavior, saying, [...] "In my honest opinion now ... I could've handled it better. ... I'm part of a community that consider themselves artists. And if there was <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have done in her defense that was more than I realized then, I would have. But the other half of me was like, 'Wow. We still haven't found the weapons of mass destruction and everybody cares about this!'" [...] He added, [...] "I probably got 10 percent of the blame, and that says something about society ... I think that America's harsher on women. And I think that America is, you know, unfairly harsh on ethnic people." ...|$|E

6000|$|But she {{continued}} [...] "That you had Mademoiselle de Marsac's portrait was <b>something</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not explain; but then I {{hear that you}} had also Lesperon's papers upon you; so {{that you may have}} become possessed of the one with the others.

60|$|Whilst I {{was deeply}} marvelling at all this, Cosimo {{looked at me}} over his shoulder, and though his lips were steady, his eyes seemed to smile, charged with a message of derision--and {{something}} more, <b>something</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not read. Then I heard his hard, metallic voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is really}} nothing to tell now, mamma," [...] said Gwendolen, in a still higher voice. [...] "I had a mistaken idea about <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do. Herr Klesmer has undeceived me. That is all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm lame and {{not much}} use, but it doesn't seem quite the thing to stay here enjoying myself, just now," [...] he said. [...] "Perhaps <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do might turn up when I got home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Brown, reflectively, [...] "there is <b>something</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> suggest, but I {{would like}} to ask another question." [...] He stopped a moment, and tapped the palm of one hand with his glasses. [...] "Why did you go out to Africa?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} trying all day," [...] said Mrs. Bell, [...] "to think of <b>something</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do for you, to help you or to relieve you {{in some way or}} other; but I can not think of any thing at all that I can do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wasn't {{thinking}} of throwing you over, but I don't {{even know what}} you mean. There seem to be no end of things I can't do. Hadn't you better tell me of <b>something</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do? Have you any idea yourself what you want from me?" ...|$|R
60|$|This {{intelligence}} {{seemed to}} disturb the messengers, for they too {{stepped out of the}} shed and stared at the mountains, muttering to each other <b>something</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not understand.
