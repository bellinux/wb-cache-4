In a letter that Garza wrote to a friend shortly before her disappearance, Garza described herself as extremely shy, but she expressed fulfillment in her work. Noting that she had recently become secretary of her parent-teacher association, she said that she was beginning to feel more confident in herself. A member of the Legion of Mary, Garza took her Catholic faith seriously. In her letter, <b>she</b> <b>indicated</b> that was finding comfort in attending Mass and Communion every day.|$|E
5|$|Due to erotomania, Hinckley's {{motivation}} for the attack was born of his obsession with actress Jodie Foster. While living in Hollywood in the late 1970s, he saw the film Taxi Driver at least 15 times, apparently identifying strongly with Travis Bickle, the lead character portrayed by Robert De Niro. The arc of the story involves Bickle's attempts to protect a 12-year-old child prostitute, played by Foster. Toward {{the end of the}} film, Bickle attempts to assassinate a United States Senator who is running for president. Over the following years, Hinckley trailed Foster around the country, {{going so far as to}} enroll in a writing course at Yale University in 1980 after reading in People magazine that she was a student there. He wrote numerous letters and notes to her in late 1980. He called her twice and refused to give up when <b>she</b> <b>indicated</b> that she was not interested in him.|$|E

25|$|The {{size of the}} {{endowment}} {{and the success of}} these programs prompted some to question whether Tilghman would implement a policy of eliminating tuition altogether.

25|$|On 1 November 2012 the Deputy Chairwoman of the Central Election Commission of Ukraine (CVK), Zhanna Usenko-Chorna, {{stated that}} the {{elections}} are heavily falsified. <b>She</b> <b>indicated</b> that several electoral districts clearly demonstrate a depravity of the single-constituency district elections in Ukraine and that as of 1 November CVK still had not received results from 14 electoral districts.

The Minister of Defense Michèle Alliot-Marie indicated to the National Assembly that the information she had did not allow her to suspect a submarine {{as the cause of}} the accident. <b>She</b> <b>indicated</b> that the British and French authorities had cooperated and provided a list of all their ships and submarines in the area of interest. Also, the titanium issue was considered trivial as titanium dioxide is a common pigment of marine paint including the one used for Bugaled Breizh.|$|E

A favourite from the start, with backing from the Western Cape, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga, the Northern Cape, the Free State and even the Eastern Cape (regarded {{during much of the}} build-up as the stronghold of main rival Athol Trollip), she was elected as the new leader by a large majority on 6 May 2007. <b>She</b> <b>indicated</b> that she would lead the party from outside Parliament, while continuing in her position as executive mayor of Cape Town.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Bishop Michael Cox of the Irish Orthodox Catholic and Apostolic Church (an Independent Catholic group not in communion with the Catholic Church) ordained O'Connor as a priest. The Roman Catholic Church {{considers}} {{ordination of women}} to be invalid and asserts that a person attempting the sacrament of ordination upon a woman incurs excommunication. The bishop had contacted her to offer ordination following her appearance on the RTÉ’s Late Late Show, during which she told the presenter, Gay Byrne, that had she not been a singer, she would have wished {{to have been a}} Catholic priest.

Cudjoe calls Angelou's {{depiction of}} the rape [...] "a burden" [...] of Caged Bird: a demonstration of [...] "the {{manner in which the}} Black female is violated in her tender years and... the 'unnecessary insult' of Southern girlhood in her movement to adolescence". Vermillion goes further, maintaining that a Black woman who writes about her rape risks reinforcing negative stereotypes about her race and gender. When asked decades later how she was able to survive such trauma, Angelou explained it by stating, [...] "I can't remember a time when I wasn't loved by somebody." [...] When asked by the same interviewer why she wrote about the experience, <b>she</b> <b>indicated</b> that she wanted to demonstrate the complexities of rape. [...] She also wanted to prevent it from happening to someone else, so that anyone who had been raped might gain understanding and not blame herself for it.|$|E
500|$|Clinton visited 112countries {{during her}} tenure, making {{her the most}} widely {{traveled}} secretary of state (Time magazine wrote that [...] "Clinton's endurance is legendary"). The {{first secretary of state}} to visit countries such as Togo and East Timor, she believed that in-person visits were more important than ever in the virtual age. As early as March 2011, <b>she</b> <b>indicated</b> she was not interested in serving a second term as Secretary of State should Obama be re-elected in 2012; in December 2012, following that re-election, Obama nominated Senator John Kerry to be Clinton's successor. Her last day as Secretary of State was February 1, 2013. Upon her departure, analysts commented that Clinton's tenure did not bring any signature diplomatic breakthroughs as some other Secretaries of State had, and highlighted her focus on goals that she thought were less tangible but would have more lasting effect.|$|E

By one vote, they kept me out. And some of the girls who are my best friends voted against me." [...] She did not agree at the time with the speculation of others that her professional rivals had their own self-interest at heart, knowing that with her out of the competition they would have a much better chance at the $5,000 first place prize award. Despite the women's snub and perceived chauvinistic terms, she nevertheless competed on the men's side, tying for ninth place. Not long afterward, <b>she</b> <b>indicated</b> to a reporter that she was [...] "thinking of dropping out of women's competition altogether." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{filming the}} reunion special at the Atlanta Biltmore Hotel on March 27, Moore implied that Williams was unfaithful during her marriage; after Williams called Moore a [...] "slut from the '90s" [...] and Moore yelled that Williams was [...] "a dumb ho" [...] from a megaphone, Williams dragged Moore {{across the floor}} by her hair. Moore was {{initially}} unable to complete a police statement because she was required to complete the reunion filming, although Williams was arrested and booked for misdemeanor battery on April 18. Moore later threatened to quit the series if Williams were to remain, commenting: [...] "we've become angry with each other, we've threatened each other and gone to the edge. But {{at the end of}} the day, we know there's a line." [...] Earlier in December 2013, Williams received additional criticism for comments made during the eighth episode, [...] "Ghosts of Girlfriends Past", wherein <b>she</b> <b>indicated</b> that she believed the Underground Railroad was an actual railroad line.|$|E
500|$|The Real Housewives of Atlanta {{has been}} criticized for {{appearing}} to fabricate portions of its storyline. One source of speculation arose during the fifth season, when Kenya Moore allegedly requested that Walter Jackson pretend to be her boyfriend; series producers were reportedly unaware of said arrangement. Moore commented that such claims were [...] "completely false", and further [...] " [...] viewers to stay tuned because the truth will come to light." [...] Moore was also criticized for alleging that she was financially stable, although she reportedly joined the series as a source of income to offset the difficulties with her lawsuits from several creditors. In May 2013, Porsha Williams allegedly staged her divorce from Kordell Stewart to secure her position on the series, which she reportedly feared was in jeopardy. In December 2013, Williams received additional criticism for comments made in an episode aired during the sixth season, where <b>she</b> <b>indicated</b> that she believed the Underground Railroad was an actual railroad line.|$|E

She stated {{that she had not}} done so before as she had not written the sign. Reporters interviewed the girl in the principal's office. Cole stated she felt Nixon was the one who could bring the country together again. Being interviewed by reporters from Washington, New York, and Chicago, <b>she</b> <b>indicated,</b> was more fun than sitting in history class. The Toledo Blade investigated the matter, but could not ascertain who made the sign, or what happened to it after Cole discarded it. John Baer, village chief of police, stated, [...] "I think this has {{to be the most important}} thing that has ever happened around here." [...] Paul Scharf, editor of the Deshler Flag, stated he did not believe the mystery of the sign's origin or fate would ever be cleared up.

500|$|Less than a {{week after}} the election, Douglas wrote to one of her {{supporters}} that she did not think there was anything her campaign could have done to change the result. Blaming the war, voter mistrust of Truman's foreign policy, and high prices at home, Douglas stated that she lost in California because Nixon was able to take {{a large part of the}} women's vote and the labor vote. Later in November, <b>she</b> <b>indicated</b> that liberals must undertake a massive effort to win in 1952. In 1956, she stated in an interview that, while Nixon had never called her a communist, he had designed his whole campaign to create the impression that she was a communist or [...] "communistic". In 1959, she wrote that she had not particularly wanted to be a senator, and in 1962 she stated that the policy of her campaign was to avoid attacks on Nixon. In her memoirs, published posthumously in 1982, she wrote, [...] "Nixon had his victory, but I had mine... He hadn't touched me. I didn't carry Richard Nixon with me, thank God." [...] She concluded her chapter on the 1950 race with, [...] "There's not much to say about the 1950 campaign except that a man ran for Senate who wanted to get there, and didn't care how." ...|$|E
500|$|The Mint struck over 125 {{million of}} the Eisenhower dollars in 1971, more than {{doubling}} its largest annual production for a dollar coin. Despite an increased mintage in 1972 to over 170 million, and despite what CoinAge magazine termed [...] "near-heroic measures {{on the part of}} the Mint", the piece did not circulate. [...] In a 1974 article for CoinAge, numismatist Clement F. Bailey noted, [...] "the circulation value of the coin has been nil". Many Eisenhower dollars were put aside as souvenirs by non-collectors. Nevertheless, the silver coins sold so well that in October 1971, Mint Director Brooks warned that orders for 1971-S proof dollars would not all be filled until well into 1972. She ascribed the delay to the large public demand and to production difficulties which <b>she</b> <b>indicated</b> had been corrected. More than 11 {{million of the}} 1971-S silver pieces were sold, in proof and uncirculated, with nearly 7 million in proof. In May 1972, Treasury Secretary John Connally, testifying before a Senate committee, described the profits the Mint had made on the silver version of the Eisenhower dollar as [...] "just unconscionable", with the average profit on a silver coin at $3.89, and expected to increase as production became more efficient.
