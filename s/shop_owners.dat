5|$|Skiing {{associations}} subsequently {{contend that}} {{veterans of the}} 10th Mountain Division had a substantial effect in the post-World War II development of skiing as a vacation industry and major sport. Ex-soldiers from the 10th laid out ski hills, designed ski lifts, became ski coaches, racers, instructors, patrollers, <b>shop</b> <b>owners,</b> and filmmakers. They wrote and published ski magazines, opened ski schools, improved ski equipment, and developed ski resorts. Up to 2,000 of the division's troops were involved in skiing-related professions after the war, and at least 60 ski resorts were founded by men of the division.|$|E
5|$|During the 18th century, {{the street}} {{began to be}} popular with the bourgeoisie living around Mayfair. <b>Shop</b> <b>owners</b> let out their upper storeys for {{residential}} purposes, attracting lodgers such as Jonathan Swift, George Selwyn, William Pitt the Elder and Laurence Sterne. In 1784, Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, an active socialite, demanded that people boycott Covent Garden as its residents had voted against Whig member of parliament Charles James Fox. This had caused him to lose his seat in parliament, leading to {{the dissolution of the}} Fox–North Coalition. She insisted people should look for nearer shopping streets, and encouraged people to go to Bond Street. Consequently, the street became a retail area for people living in Mayfair. By the end of the century, an upper-class social group known as the Bond Street Loungers had appeared, wearing expensive wigs and parading {{up and down the street}} in a pretentious manner.|$|E

5|$|On 12 February, MNS workers {{attacked}} {{vendors and}} shopkeepers from North India {{in various parts}} of Maharashtra and destroyed government property to vent their anger against the reported move to arrest Raj. Sporadic violence was reported in Beed and Aurangabad. State-run buses in these areas were stone-pelted, resulting in the arrest of several MNS workers. In Nashik, MNS workers vandalised several shops belonging to North Indians, forcing other shops and business establishments to close down. One shopkeeper was severely beaten and was admitted to Nashik General Hospital. Banks and schools promptly closed after these incidents. Stone pelting by angry mobs was also reported from the city's Shalimar and Bytco squares, and the Satpur and Ambad industrial areas remained closed. Nashik police detained 26MNS workers after the violence. Six municipal cooperators were also put under preventive arrest. Additional police pickets were deployed {{in various parts of}} the city, including Shalimar and Ambad Chowk, Satpur, Nashik Road, the MNS head office at Mumbai Naka and some of the city suburbs. In Pune, MNS workers pelted stones on state-run buses and attacked a few <b>shop</b> <b>owners</b> in Pune's Laxmi Road area, prompting shops to shut down to avoid similar attacks.|$|E
5|$|The Mumbai Police {{announced}} its move to put Raj under their custody on 13 February, which created an upsurge {{of violence in}} the state and led to two deaths. Attacks on North Indians were reported from Mumbai, Pune, Jalna, Beed, Aurangabad and Latur. Shops, offices and other business establishments were shut down in different parts of Mumbai, as MNS workers threatened violence in case their leader was arrested. Central Mumbai localities were most affected, especially around Dadar and Shivaji Park, the strongholds of both the MNS and the Shiv Sena. The police blocked roads in front of the residence of Raj in the Shivaji Park area. A civic activist named James John was assaulted by suspected MNS workers while he was attempting to photograph them forcing <b>shop</b> <b>owners</b> to down shutters in JB Nagar, Andheri. John suffered two rib fractures and bruises on his lungs. In Nashik, an employee of the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, a Maharashtrian, died during a stone pelting on state-run buses by MNS supporters. A migrant from Bihar, who was a security guard with a private company at Igatpuri in Nashik district, was killed by a mob.|$|E

25|$|In 2009 Alejandra Moreno, the {{coordinator}} of the Historical Center Authority, announced that the city government would pedestrianise the street. Though resisted by <b>shop</b> <b>owners</b> at the time, the change has been a success with the street being very crowded with pedestrians and increases in real-estate value for landholders.

25|$|In France, {{the sale}} of {{products}} containing butyl nitrite has been prohibited since 1990 on grounds of danger to consumers.

25|$|The 1923 San Pedro Maritime {{strike was}} the biggest {{challenge}} to {{the dominance of the}} open shop philosophy that controlled Los Angeles until the 1930s.

Another factor which helped defeat the strike was the high amount of strikebreakers who were brought into the city from all other parts of the state, which helped keep the docks open enough to allow commercial business to take place. The open shop would remain the ideology that ran Los Angeles for another 15 years.|$|E
