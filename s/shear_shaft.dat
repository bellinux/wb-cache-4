This paper describes the site's geotechnical characteristics and experimental arrangements before defining and describing the stable, unstable or meta-stable responses observed under various combinations of cyclic loading. The interpretation draws on numerical analyses and a parallel model study by Tsuha et al.

It is argued that cyclic degradation is controlled by: (i) contraction in the highly constrained interface shear zone and (ii) kinematic yielding within the surrounding soil mass.

The proposed retrofitting technology employs either High Performance Fiber Reinforced Cementitious Composites (HPFRCCs) or Textile Rein-forced Cementitious Composites (TRCCs). 14 mock-ups of coupling beam units, scale 1 : 2, have been casted and subjected to either monotonic or cyclic loading tests. The different resisting mechanisms in conventional plain and reinforced concrete coupling beams have been first of all investigated (tensile strength of concrete in plain concrete coupling beam; strut-and-tie mechanisms in coupling beams reinforced with only longitudinal bars; enhancement of the aforementioned mechanism due to stirrups). The influence of the boundary condi-tions due to the <b>shear</b> wall <b>shafts</b> on the coupling beam spanning between, has been investigated.

40|$|A {{simplified}} {{analytical method}} is presented for nonlinear {{analysis of the}} behaviour of pile groups under vertical loads. A hyperbolic approach is adopted to describe the nonlinear relationship between the <b>shaft</b> <b>shear</b> stresses and the relative shaft displacements along a confined disturbed soil zone around a pile-soil interface. Outside the disturbed zone, the soils are assumed to behave in a linearly elastic state. By adopting the elastic closed-form analytical solution to approximate the displacement fields around a single vertically loaded pile, and the principle of superposition, a new transfer function is presented for analysis of the behaviour of pile groups in multilayered soils. Furthermore, with a simplified assumption of separating the shaft from the base interaction factors for individual piles in a pile group, a highly effective iterative procedure is developed to examine the nonlinear load-displacement behaviour of a pile group up to the failure state. Comparisons of the load-settlement responses {{for a number of}} well-instrumented field pile group test results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed analytical method.

40|$|A {{probabilistic}} {{approach to the}} torsional vibration problem of a marine diesel engine shafting system has been developed. In this analysis, the <b>shafting</b> <b>shear</b> stress {{is found to be}} a Gaussian, harmonizable cyclostationary process with a harmonic series representation consisting of two complex conjugate components. In this paper, the level crossing problem for this stress process is studied. Two methods for estimating the probability that the stress exceeds a specified threshold at least once over a given time interval are presented. In the first method, a local maximum of the process is approximated by the value of the corresponding envelope at the time of occurrence of this maximum. A Markov-type condition is assumed to hold for the local maxima. The second method assumes that the maximum of the process over a reasonable number of cycles is approximately equal to that of the envelope process. The envelope crossings are assumed to constitute a Poisson process. The two methods are applied to estimate the upcrossing probability in various cases. The results of both approaches are found to be in good agreement with those from Monte Carlo simulation. © 1989 ASM...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{ship and}} {{aircraft}} turbine rotors, the rotating mass unbalance {{and the different}} movements of the rotor base are among the main causes of vibrations in bending. The goal {{of this paper is}} to investigate the dynamic behavior of an on-board rotor under rigid base excitations. The modeling takes into consideration six types of base deterministic motions (rotations and translations) when the kinetic and strain energies in addition to the virtual work of the rotating flexible rotor components are computed. The finite element method is used in the rotor modeling by employing the Timoshenko beam theory. The proposed on-board rotor model takes into account the rotary inertia, the gyroscopic inertia, the <b>shear</b> deformation of <b>shaft</b> as well as the geometric asymmetry of shaft and/or rigid disk. The Lagrange's equations are applied to establish the differential equations of the rotor in bending with respect to the rigid base which represents a noninertial reference frame. The linear equations of motion display periodic parametric coefficients due to the asymmetry of the rotor and time-varying parametric coefficients due to the base rotational motions. In the proposed applications, the rotor mounted on rigid/elastic bearings is excited by a rotating mass unbalance associated with sinusoidal vibrations of the rigid base. The dynamic behavior of the rotor is analyzed by means of orbits of the rotor as well as fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) ...|$|R

The main objective {{of this article is}} to predict the dynamic behavior of a rotor in the presence of base excitations. The proposed on-board rotor model is based on the Timoshenko beam finite element. It takes into account the effects corresponding to rotary inertia, gyroscopic inertia, and <b>shear</b> deformation of <b>shaft</b> as well as the geometric asymmetry of disk and/or shaft and considers six types of deterministic motions (rotations and translations) of the rotor's rigid base. The use of Lagrange's equations associated with the finite element method yields the linear second-order differential equations of vibratory motion of the rotating rotor in bending relative to the moving rigid base which forms a non-inertial frame of reference. The linear equations of motion highlight periodic parametric terms due to the geometric asymmetry of the rotor components and time-varying parametric terms due to the rotational motions of the rotor rigid base. These parametric terms are considered as sources of internal excitation and can lead to lateral dynamic instability. In the presented applications, the rotor is excited by a rotating mass unbalance combined with constant rotation and sinusoidal translation of the base.

40|$|A bounding-surface {{plasticity}} {{constitutive model}} based on critical-state soil mechanics {{is used for}} the mathematical simulation of the mechanical response of sands. Modifications and additions have been made to previously published versions of the model in order to improve its versatility and performance. The model is shown to simulate satisfactorily the mechanical response of sands at small and large strains under various loading conditions, while taking into account the inherent and stress-induced anisotropy of the sand. ^ The constitutive model is calibrated against experimental data for Toyoura sand, clean Ottawa sand, and mixtures of Ottawa sand with non-plastic silt. The constitutive model has been implemented in a finite element code in order to perform analyses of boundary-value problems related to the field of foundation engineering. A semi-implicit stress-point algorithm {{is used for the}} integration of the constitutive stress-strain rate equations, which has been enhanced by a sub-stepping scheme with error control for increased accuracy. ^ Finite element analyses of <b>shearing</b> along the <b>shaft</b> of a non-displacement pile are performed in order to examine the development of limit shaft resistance and the changes in stress state around the shaft upon axial loading of the pile. Based on these simulations, a relationship between the initial density and stress state of the sand and the lateral earth pressure coefficient at limit-shaft-resistance conditions is proposed. The finite element simulations also shed light on the issue of scale effects arising in small-scale model pile tests. ^ Finally, finite element analyses are performed to study the factors affecting the bearing capacity of strip and circular footings resting on the surface of a sand layer, with special focus on the effect of the sand density and footing size. The present numerical study provides useful insight on the validity of the bearing capacity factors used in practice, and on the choice of the friction angle {{to be used in the}} classical bearing capacity equation. Equations for the bearing capacity factor Nγ and the shape factor sγ that take into account the effects of relative density and pressure level are also established. ...|$|R
40|$|Wind {{turbines}} {{are among}} the largest rotating machines {{in the world and}} are subjected to highly variable loading and environmental conditions. In actively-controlled horizontal axis wind turbines, generator power output, wind speed, and wind direction are monitored and fed into a control system to pivot (yaw) the rotor into the oncoming wind and to rotate (pitch) the blades to maintain the most efficient rotational speed for power-generation and limit excessive loading in high winds. However, these systems do not take into account that wind loading can vary significantly along the span of the blades, and it is the blade responses to this loading that dictate both power output and reliability of the turbine. More detailed knowledge of the blade structural dynamic response has the potential to improve wind turbine control so that high power output is maintained while damaging loading conditions are mitigated, and the data analysis methods applied in this thesis seek to accomplish those goals using blade-mounted inertial and strain sensors. ^ Both scheduled and unscheduled maintenance on wind turbines are costly, and downtime can significantly reduce revenue. Expanding current condition monitoring systems to integrate blade load monitoring can improve maintenance scheduling and allow for controlling or positioning the turbine so as to reduce asymmetric loading and rotor imbalances which can damage structural and drive line components. As a step toward achieving these goals, a set of data analysis tools were developed for processing generator power, rotor operational acceleration and strain measurements, and nacelle and drivetrain loads in both horizontal and vertical axis wind turbines (HAWTs and VAWTs, respectively). Modal filtering of blade responses was demonstrated to be effective in classifying the loading cycles of potentially damaging vibration in an experimental VAWT subjected to a variety of wind shear conditions and showed that proper placement of a VAWT in a wind field can reduce excitation of asymmetric modes by as much as 40 % while increasing power output by 5 %. Blade vibration analysis was also used to classify individual blade pitch error on an operating 900 watt HAWT. Computer models were created to verify this technique in utility scale HAWTs, as well as to demonstrate the effectiveness of a combination of condition monitoring methods for evaluating rotor mass imbalance and aerodynamic asymmetry in the form of blade pitch error. It was shown that even a single-blade pitch error of 1 ° in a utility scale turbine can increase the nacelle yaw moment by 250 %, a 2 ° error increased the low speed shaft bending moment by 100 %, and a 5 ° error reduced the power output by over 7 %. A 0. 5 % blade mass imbalance increased the low speed <b>shaft</b> <b>shear</b> force by 60 %, the tower top side-to-side shear force by 50 %, and the tower-base side-to-side shear force by 250 %. Therefore, it is critical that these imbalances be detected and accounted for to reduce or prevent potentially damaging loading conditions and maintain peak performance. Imbalance detection algorithms using only non-blade measurements, which are {{the current state of the}} art, could not distinguish between simultaneously applied mass imbalances and pitch errors, and could not locate the blade responsible for the pitch or mass imbalance in these simulations. A combination of blade and non-blade measurements were formulated into an algorithm for the detection and classification of pitch and mass imbalances in a wind turbine rotor - the algorithm quantifies the magnitude of the imbalance and locates the problematic blade or blades. ...|$|R
