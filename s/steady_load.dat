Under a sudden {{increase}} in throttle, the valve opens {{in the same}} intake stroke and a greater amount of fuel is injected. This allows immediate acceleration. For the next stroke, the ECU calculates engine load at the new, higher RPM, and decides how to open the valve: early or late, wide-open or half-open. The optimal opening and timing are always reached and combustion is as precise as possible. This, of course, is impossible with a normal camshaft, which opens the valve for the whole intake period, and always to full lift.|$|E
50|$|The {{temperature}} of the cooling air may range from well below freezing to 50 °C. Further, while engines in long-haul boat or rail service may operate at a <b>steady</b> <b>load,</b> road vehicles often see widely varying and quickly varying load. Thus, the cooling system is designed to vary cooling so the engine is neither too hot nor too cold. Cooling system regulation includes adjustable baffles in the air flow (sometimes called 'shutters' and commonly run by a pneumatic 'shutterstat); a fan which operates either independently of the engine, such as an electric fan, or which has an adjustable clutch; a thermostatic valve or just 'thermostat' that can block the coolant flow when too cool. In addition, the motor, coolant, and heat exchanger have some heat capacity which smooths out temperature increase in short sprints. Some engine controls shut down an engine or limit it to half throttle if it overheats. Modern electronic engine controls adjust cooling based on throttle to anticipate a temperature rise, and limit engine power output to compensate for finite cooling.|$|E

40|$|Compressor {{blade row}} combined/simultaneous gust and {{oscillating}} blade unsteady aerodynamics were experimentally investigated from both forced response and flutter perspectives. This included the individual investigations of gust unsteady aerodynamics and oscillating airfoil unsteady aerodynamics. The effects of <b>steady</b> <b>loading</b> and oscillation amplitude were also studied. This research addressed {{the validity of}} the small perturbation assumption and the applicability of the superposition principle inherent in linear unsteady aerodynamic analyses. ^ Gust unsteady aerodynamic forcing functions, experimentally modeled with two perforated plate wakes, had significant vortical and potential components. These vortical gusts satisfied the primary linear theory vortical gust requirements, but not the secondary. The rotor blade surface gust response data were correlated with predictions from two linear analyses LINSUB and SFLOW/LINFLO. Both predictions exhibited good trendwise correlation but poor amplitude correlation. ^ The torsion mode oscillating blade unsteady aerodynamics were investigated utilizing an experimental influence coefficient. technique. Oscillation magnitude and <b>steady</b> <b>loading</b> {{have a significant effect on}} both the influence coefficient data and the equivalent all blades oscillating unsteady pressure data. These data correlated better with LINSUB than with LINFLO, particularly at high <b>steady</b> <b>loading.</b> Nonlinear blade unsteady aerodynamic responses were evident for oscillation amplitudes larger than 5 ∘. ^ The combined/simultaneous gust and oscillating blade unsteady aerodynamic data established limited applicability of superposition principle at high oscillation amplitudes and high <b>steady</b> <b>loading,</b> with superposition generally leading to underprediction of the unsteady lift but an overprediction of the unsteady moment. ^ The combined/simultaneous gust and oscillating blade unsteady aerodynamics are significantly influenced by the phasing between the gust excitation and the blade motion. Gust-blade motion phase angles leading to a constructive interaction of the gust with the oscillating blade aerodynamics increase the unsteady lift and moment magnitudes with small changes in phase while gust-blade motion phase angles leading to a destructive interaction decrease the lift and moment magnitudes with large changes in phase. Thus, neglecting the aerodynamic damping can lead to serious errors in forced response prediction. Combining a gust excitation with an oscillating blade row can alter blade row aerodynamic stability, depending on the gust-blade motion phase angle. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} a failure {{analysis of a}} reverse shaft in the transmission system of an all-terrain vehicle (ATV). The reverse shaft with splines fractured into two pieces during operation. Visual examination of the fractured surface clearly showed cracks initiated from the roots of spline teeth. To find out the cause of fracture of the shaft, a finite element analysis was carried out to pre-dict the stress state of the shaft under <b>steady</b> <b>loading</b> and shock <b>loading,</b> respectively. The <b>steady</b> <b>loading</b> was pro-duced under normal operation, while the shock loading could be generated by an abrupt change of operation such as start-up or sudden braking during working. Results of stress analysis reveal that the highest stressed area coin-cided with the fractured regions of the failed shaft. The maximum stress predicted under shock loading exceeded the yield strength and {{was believed to be}} the stimulant for crack initiation and propagation at this weak region. The failure analysis thus showed that the premature fatigue fracture of the shaft was caused by abnormal operation.

40|$|The {{resonant}} {{response of}} turbomachinery rotors, in particular IBRs, {{is a significant}} problem throughout the gas turbine industry because of mistuning and mechanical damping issues. To minimize or avoid these problems, experimentally validated design systems which predict the resonant response of mistuned rotors are required. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of appropriate mistuned IBR resonant response data for this validation. Also, adding friction dampers to IBRs to decrease large amplitude vibrations is only a very limited option. Hence techniques for control of IBR resonant response must be considered. This research addresses these issues through experiments in the Purdue Transonic Compressor, the Purdue 3 -Stage Highly Loaded Compressor and the Purdue High Speed Centrifugal Compressor. The primary instrumentation for these experiments is a state-of-the-art NSMS, thereby enabling benchmark resonant response data to be acquired. ^ The mistuning of the baseline IBR in the Purdue Transonic Compressor is measured, {{with the effects of}} <b>steady</b> <b>loading</b> on the IBR 2 nd bending resonant response then experimentally quantified. A mistuning model is then utilized to select mistuning distributions which alter the resonant response of this IBR, with three mistuned IBR configurations subsequently selected. This intentional mistuning is accomplished by inserting tip-radial holes into selected blades. After measuring the mistuning of each IBR, the effects of <b>steady</b> <b>loading</b> on the 2 nd bending resonant response of each IBR are experimentally investigated. The nominal loading data are then correlated with predictions from a model which includes aerodynamic damping. ^ Vane clocking as a passive technique for control of resonant response is demonstrated through experiments in the Purdue 3 -Stage Highly Loaded Compressor. The 1 st torsion resonant response of IBR- 2 and IBR- 3 is investigated with the upstream and downstream vane rows clocked to six configurations and the effects of <b>steady</b> <b>loading</b> also addressed. ^ Finally, the resonant response of a high-speed centrifugal compressor impeller is investigated in the Purdue High Speed Centrifugal Compressor. The forcing function to the impeller is the potential field from the downstream diffuser vanes. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{study has}} been {{completed}} to quantify the contribution of fan broadband noise to advanced high bypass turbofan engine system noise levels. The result suggests that reducing fan broadband noise can produce 3 to 4 EPNdB in engine system noise reduction, once the fan tones are eliminated. Further, {{in conjunction with the}} elimination of fan tones and an increase in bypass ratio, a potential reduction of 7 to 10 EPNdB in system noise can be achieved. In addition, an initial assessment of engine broadband noise source mechanisms has been made, concluding that the dominant source of fan broadband noise is the interaction of incident inlet boundary layer turbulence with the fan rotor. This source has two contributors, i. e., unsteady life dipole response and <b>steady</b> <b>loading</b> quadrupole response. The quadrupole contribution was found {{to be the most important}} component, suggesting that broadband noise reduction can be achieved by the reduction of <b>steady</b> <b>loading</b> field-turbulence field quadrupole interaction.
