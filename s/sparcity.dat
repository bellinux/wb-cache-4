Sparse architectures provide compression of the models learned and speed-ups of computations, they can also surpass their unstructured or fully connected counterparts.

In this paper, we investigate how the accuracy and training speed of the models depend on the topology and sparsity of the neural network. Previous approaches using <b>sparcity</b> are all based on fully connected neural network models and create <b>sparcity</b> during training phase, instead we explicitly define a sparse architectures of connections before the training. Building compact neural network models is coherent with empirical observations showing that there is much redundancy in learned neural network models.

As such, identifying error-prone sequences helps understand and predict application use. The classification problem we describe is typical in supervised machine learning, but the composite pattern we propose investigates it with several techniques to control for data brittleness. Data pre-processing, feature selection, parametric classification, and cross-validation are the major instruments that enable a good degree of control over this classification problem.

In addition, the <b>sparcity</b> of the observation matrix made the SVT algorithm the most suitable resolution method for matrix completion problem.

Standard single-emitter fitting programs render the technique impractically slow (i.e. minute-scale acquisition times), even {{with the aid of}} the light-sheet illumination. Since the Nyquist sampling theorem requires approximately two data points per resolution unit to faithfully reconstruct an image (Shroff et al. 2008; Patterson et al. 2010), reducing the number of image frames requires increasing the number of resolvable single-molecule events per frame. Spatially overlapping molecules within a diffraction-limited focus volume in the same frame breaches the <b>sparcity</b> requirement of many single-emitter fitting programs (Henriques et al. 2010; Wolter et al. 2012) and further slow down the data acquisition.

The rock avalanche fell onto glacier ice, probably channelled along a furrow between two glaciers, and stopped on the glacier foreland, resulting in its elongated shape and long runout distance. Its distal margin may have become remobilized as a rock glacier, but a rock glacier origin for the entire landform is discounted due to lack of source debris, presence of matrix, lack of transverse ridges, and <b>sparcity</b> of melt-out collapse pits. Lichenometric dating of the deposit indicates an approximate emplacement age of ad 1900. Analysis highlights the interaction of rock-slope failures and glaciers during deglacierization in a neoparaglacial setting, with reduced slope stability due to debuttressing and permafrost degradation, and enhanced landslide mobility due to flow over a glacier and topographic channelling.

However, depending on the analysis used, certain types of creative outputs can be treated as ideas, rather than the protectable expressions that are given {{the status of a}} copyright work.

Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping software was used to construct maps of South Dakota that included levels of uranium concentrations in soil and stream water and uranium deposits. Maps of existing populations and the types of land were also generated. Existing data about average indoor radon levels by county taken from a databank were included for consideration. Although the soil and stream data and existing recorded average indoor radon levels were sparse, it was determined that the most likely locations of elevated indoor radon would be in the northwest and southwest corners of the state. Indoor radon levels were only available for 9 out of 66 counties in South Dakota. This <b>sparcity</b> of data precluded a study of correlation of radon to geological features, but further motivates the need for more testing in the state.

From this coding process four themes emerged as the ways in which HIV positive domestic helpers construct their experiences within the families. Findings indicate that the participants in this study construct their experiences around the following main themes that emerged, e. g. <b>sparcity</b> of conversations about HIV & AIDS, limited knowledge about HIV & AIDS, changed attitudes of employers with resulting change in work-related responsibilities and unchanged attitudes in the children in the families of employment. A particularistic scrutiny of the data and research results indicates that participants who experience visible symptoms of HIV & AIDS may forewarn employers when domestic helpers are HIV-positive. The domestic helpers in this study experienced fluctuating negative attitudes, reduction of job content and retrenchment with concomitant financial repercussions for them and their biological families. However, the participants in this study indicated that the attitude of employers’ children towards them remained positive after diagnosis. This significant finding served an affirming purpose for the participants in the study. AFRIKAANS : Die artikel rapporteer oor ’n studie wat die ervarings van MIV-positiewe huiswerkers binne hulle werkgewersgesinne verken het. ’n Grondslagteoretiese benadering is gevolg om die data te analiseer wat tydens in-diepte onderhoude met 14 huiswerkers gevoer is. Die bevindinge van die studie dui aan dat die deelnemers in hierdie studie hulle ervaring rondom vier temas konstrueer, naamlik: i) beperkte gesprekvoering rakende MIV & VIGS; ii) beperkte kennis rakende MIV & VIGS; iii) veranderde houdings van werkgewers en gepaardgaande wysigings aan werksladings; en iv) onveranderde houdings by die kinders in die werkgewersgesinne. Die studie beklemtoon die weerloosheid van MIV-positiewe huiswerkers in Suid-Afrika en ook die belangrikheid van voortgaande bekendmaking van toepaslike inligting rakende MIV-positiewe diagnoses...|$|E
