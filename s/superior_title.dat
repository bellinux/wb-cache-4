25|$|In Brazil, the anaesthetists are {{physicians}} who have specialized {{in the field}} of anaesthesia. Approximately 650 physicians are admitted yearly to a three-year specialization program. The residency programs can take place at training centers in university hospitals. These training centres are accredited by the Brazilian Society of Anaesthesiology (SBA), or other referral hospitals accredited by the ministry of health. Most of the residents are trained in different areas, including ICU, pain management, and anaesthesia sub-specialties, including transplants and pediatrics. In order to be a certified anaesthetist in Brazil, the residents must give exams throughout the residency program {{and at the end of}} the program. The SBA conducts these examinations.

50|$|A master {{could address}} his servant, and a farmer his farmhand, by Christian {{name in the}} third person; that was more common between females, as the female world was {{generally}} more confined, but more restricted between the sexes. A subordinate, in each case, answered by using the <b>superior's</b> <b>title</b> or, in private, the informal term for his rank (e.g. herrn, patron).|$|R

50|$|Descendents of the Ametrano were to {{hold the}} duchy until their line became extinct in the 1970s. During the 300 years that the family held the title, {{the name of the}} ducal house changed when the duchy passed through the female line. As the family prospered and intermarried, it {{acquired}} further older and grander titles until the duchy of San Donato became a secondary title, often handed out for use to a younger son - while the head of the family and true holder of the <b>title</b> used the <b>superior</b> <b>titles</b> of Prince of Bonifati or Duke of Malvito.|$|R

5000|$|As {{with other}} titles, the {{prestige}} of the vestēs declined {{towards the end of the}} 11th century, when it is attested as being held by lower-ranking officials. To counter this devaluation, the <b>superior</b> <b>title</b> of prōtovestēs (Greek: πρωτοβέστης, [...] "first vestēs") appeared at the same time. Both titles, however, do not appear to have survived the reign of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081-1118).|$|E

50|$|Though {{the kings}} of Castile and León {{initially}} continued to take the title King of León as the <b>superior</b> <b>title,</b> and to use a lion {{as part of their}} standard, power in fact became centralized in Castile, as exemplified by the Leonese language's replacement by Spanish. The Kingdom of León and the Kingdom of Castile kept different Parliaments, different flags, different coin and different laws until the Modern Era, when Spain, like other European states, centralized governmental power.|$|E

The grandeeship was conferred on 135 barons, who wore the crown of viscount in their coats of arms, and 146 viscounts, who wore the crown of count.|$|E

Sam Bishop of IGN was more critical of the PlayStation version, citing a lack of in-race music and sluggish controls, and suggested that Formula One 99 was a <b>superior</b> <b>title.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In Scots law, excambion is the {{exchange}} of land.

When British Airways Board sold the unclaimed bracelet for £850, Mr Parker challenged their claim to the bracelet.

British Airways Board were thus unable to assert <b>superior</b> <b>title</b> over the bracelet.|$|E
50|$|In {{the other}} world, the {{ancestors}} are the actual carrying-holders of transcendent sacred energies.

In either case, Roog is the first source of the transcendence of sacred energies.|$|R

5000|$|Allodial {{lands are}} the {{absolute}} property of their owner and {{not subject to}} any rent, service, or acknowledgment to a <b>superior.</b> Allodial <b>title</b> is therefore an alternative to feudal land tenure. However, historian J.C.

50|$|According to the Royal Warrant {{any person}} not entered on the Roll {{shall not be}} {{entitled}} to the precedence of a peer or addressed or {{referred to as a}} peer in any official document. However a peer who is enrolled in a junior title (not having proved a senior title) is nonetheless noted in the Roll as 'customarily styled' by the <b>superior</b> <b>title</b> in question, which is then named—even though succession to this title has not been proved. One example of many is Viscount Midleton, who appears as Lord Brodrick on the Roll, the title to which he has proved succession, with the statement that he is customarily known as Viscount Midleton and a cross-reference from 'Midleton'.|$|E

Four years earlier {{his father had been}} created Baron Runciman and [...] "of Doxford" [...] was consequently used to differentiate from his father's title. This was a rare case of a father and son sitting in the House of Lords at the same time, with the son holding a <b>superior</b> <b>title.</b> A few months later his father died and he inherited both the barony and his father's shipping business.|$|E
