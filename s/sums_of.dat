Income from a dowry could be significant. The larger a woman's dowry relative to her husband's wealth, the more influence she was likely {{to have in the}} household since she retained the dowry if the couple divorced. Athenian women could also acquire property by inheritance if they were the closest surviving relative, but could not contractually acquire or dispose of property.|$|E

The shortage <b>of</b> the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> square errors criterion is point out. The <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> absolute errors criterion, maximum error criterion and the <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> power of errors criterion are proposed.
