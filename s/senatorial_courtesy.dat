5|$|Garfield's accomplishments as {{president}} included {{a resurgence of}} presidential authority against <b>senatorial</b> <b>courtesy</b> in executive appointments, energizing American naval power, and purging corruption in the Post Office, all during his extremely short time in office. Garfield made notable diplomatic and judiciary appointments, including a U.S. Supreme Court justice. He enhanced {{the powers of the}} presidency when he defied the powerful New York senator Roscoe Conkling by appointing William H. Robertson to the lucrative post of Collector of the Port of New York, starting a fracas that ended with Robertson's confirmation and Conkling's resignation from the Senate. Garfield advocated agricultural technology, an educated electorate, and civil rights for African Americans. He also proposed substantial civil service reform, eventually passed by Congress in 1883 and signed into law by his successor, Chester A. Arthur, as the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act. On July 2, 1881, he was shot at the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station in Washington D.C. by Charles J. Guiteau, a lawyer and writer with a grievance. The wound was not immediately fatal for Garfield, but his doctors' uncleaned and unprotected hands are said to have led to infection that caused his death on September 19. Guiteau was convicted of the murder and was executed in June 1882; he tried to name his crime as simple assault by blaming the doctors for Garfield's death. With his term cut short by his death after only 200 days, and much of it spent in ill health trying to recover from the attack, Garfield is little-remembered for other than his assassination. Historians often forgo listing him in rankings of U.S. presidents due to the short length of his presidency.|$|E
25|$|The {{president}} {{also has the}} power to nominate federal judges, including members of the United States courts of appeals and the Supreme Court of the United States. However, these nominations require Senate confirmation. Securing Senate approval can provide a major obstacle for presidents who wish to orient the federal judiciary toward a particular ideological stance. When nominating judges to U.S. district courts, presidents often respect the long-standing tradition of <b>senatorial</b> <b>courtesy.</b> Presidents may also grant pardons and reprieves (Bill Clinton pardoned Patty Hearst on his last day in office), as is often done just before the end of a presidential term, but not without controversy.|$|E
25|$|In 1933 Byrd was {{appointed}} to fill a vacancy in the United States Senate; he won reelection as a Democrat in 1933, 1934, 1940, 1946, 1952, 1958, and 1964. Byrd and his colleague Carter Glass invoked <b>senatorial</b> <b>courtesy</b> to stop Roosevelt's nomination of Floyd H. Roberts to a federal judgeship in Virginia in 1939. Byrd broke with Roosevelt and became an opponent of the New Deal, but he was an internationalist and strongly supported Roosevelt's foreign policy. As war loomed in 1941 Congress approved his proposal for a joint House-Senate committee to look into ways of eliminating nonessential expenditures. By late September, the Joint Committee on Reduction of Non-essential Federal Expenditures was in operation with Senator Byrd as Chairman; it built his national reputation as an economizer.|$|E
25|$|Glass {{served at}} the Treasury until 1920, when he was {{appointed}} to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Virginia's senior senator, Thomas Staples Martin. Martin had been widely regarded as the head of Virginia's Democratic Party, a role filled during the 1920s by Harry Flood Byrd of Winchester, another Virginia newspaperman who shared many of Glass's political views and who headed the political machine of Conservative Democrats known as the Byrd Organization, which dominated Virginia's politics until the 1960s. In 1933, Byrd became Virginia's junior Senator, joining Glass in the Senate after former Governor and then-senior U.S. Senator Claude A. Swanson was appointed as U.S. Secretary of the Navy by President Franklin Roosevelt. Both Glass and Byrd were opposed to Roosevelt's New Deal policies. Each was a strong supporter of fiscal conservatism and state's rights. Glass and Byrd invoked <b>senatorial</b> <b>courtesy</b> to defeat Roosevelt's nomination of Floyd H. Roberts to a federal judgeship, {{as part of a broader}} conflict over control of federal patronage in Virginia.|$|E
500|$|Garfield's {{appointment}} of James infuriated Conkling, a factional {{opponent of the}} Postmaster General, who demanded a compensatory appointment for his faction, such as the position of Secretary of the Treasury. The resulting squabble occupied much of Garfield's brief presidency. The feud with Conkling reached a climax when the president, at Blaine's instigation, nominated Conkling's enemy, Judge William H. Robertson, to be Collector of the Port of New York. This {{was one of the}} prize patronage positions below cabinet level, and was then held by Edwin A. Merritt. Conkling raised the time-honored principle of <b>senatorial</b> <b>courtesy</b> in an attempt to defeat the nomination, to no avail. Garfield, who believed the practice was corrupt, would not back down and threatened to withdraw all nominations unless Robertson was confirmed, intending to [...] "settle the question whether the President is registering clerk of the Senate or the Executive of the United States." [...] Ultimately, Conkling and his New York colleague, Senator Thomas C. Platt, resigned their Senate seats to seek vindication, but found only further humiliation when the New York legislature elected others in their places. Robertson was confirmed as Collector and Garfield's victory was clear. To Blaine's chagrin, the victorious Garfield returned to his goal of balancing the interests of party factions, and nominated a number of Conkling's Stalwart friends to offices.|$|E
2500|$|A {{judge of}} a United States {{district}} court is officially titled a [...] "United States District Judge". [...] Other federal judges, including circuit judges and Supreme Court Justices, can also {{sit in a}} district court upon assignment by the chief judge of the circuit or by the Chief Justice of the United States. [...] The number of judges in each district court (and {{the structure of the}} judicial system generally) is set by Congress in the United States Code. [...] The President appoints the federal judges for terms of good behavior (subject to the advice and consent of the Senate), so the nominees often share at least some of his or her convictions. In states represented by a senator of the President's party, the senator (or the more senior of them if both senators are of the president's party) has substantial input into the nominating process, and through a tradition known as <b>senatorial</b> <b>courtesy</b> can exercise an unofficial veto over a nominee unacceptable to the senator.|$|E
60|$|The Honourable Hilary {{sat down}} again, {{and at that}} instant the door was {{suddenly}} flung open by Postmaster Bill Fleeting of Brampton, his genial face aflame with excitement and streaming with perspiration. Forgotten, in this moment, is <b>senatorial</b> <b>courtesy</b> {{and respect for the}} powers of the feudal system.|$|E
50|$|<b>Senatorial</b> <b>courtesy</b> is a Senate {{tradition}} that allows home county legislators to intercede to prevent consideration {{of a local}} resident nominated by the Governor for a position that requires Senate confirmation. Any of the senators from the nominee's home county can invoke <b>senatorial</b> <b>courtesy</b> to block a nomination, temporarily or permanently, without any obligation to justify {{the basis of their}} actions.|$|E
50|$|Following the 1973 Democratic landslide, where Democrats won a 29-10 {{majority}} (with one Independent), {{the newly}} elected Senate Democratic leadership—Senate President Frank J. Dodd (D-West Orange) and Majority Leader Matthew Feldman (D-Teaneck) -- moved to eliminate the Caucus System and <b>Senatorial</b> <b>Courtesy</b> rules. The Caucus System rule ended for good, but a faction of the Democratic majority led by Senator James P. Dugan (D-Jersey City), the incumbent Democratic State Chairman, teamed with Republican Senators to continue the practice of <b>Senatorial</b> <b>Courtesy.</b>|$|E

The caucus system rule ended for good, but a faction of the Democratic majority led by Senator James P. Dugan (D-Jersey City), the incumbent Democratic State Chairman, teamed with Republican Senators to continue the practice of <b>Senatorial</b> <b>courtesy.</b> In a ruling issued on December 23, 1993, the New Jersey Supreme Court upheld the use of <b>senatorial</b> <b>courtesy,</b> {{despite the fact that}} it is an unwritten rule. The vote in the Supreme Court had been 3 - 3, with Chief Justice Robert Wilentz recusing himself because he had made a statement that opposed its use in the case of Judge Murphy.|$|E
50|$|Also in June 2007, Loretta Weinberg used <b>senatorial</b> <b>courtesy</b> {{privileges}} {{to hold up}} {{consideration of}} a new term in office for Bergen County Prosecutor John Molinelli.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, Nia Gill of Essex County {{threatened}} to use <b>senatorial</b> <b>courtesy</b> {{to block a}} broad range of nominees from her home county as a way to gain leverage to reach a compromise on a needle exchange program aimed at controlling the spread of HIV. In June 2007, Gill staged a week-long protest under which she invoked <b>senatorial</b> <b>courtesy</b> to block the consideration of Jon Corzine's nomination of Stuart Rabner as chief justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court. Rabner's nomination had been considered likely, but hearings that had been scheduled by the Senate Judiciary Committee to consider Rabner were postponed as Gill would not sign off on the nomination.|$|E
50|$|When Democrats won {{control of}} the State Senate in 1965, with Hughes ally John A. Lynch Sr. (D-New Brunswick) {{installed}} as the new Senate President, the Caucus System was abolished; <b>Senatorial</b> <b>Courtesy</b> was continued. Republicans reinstated the Caucus System rule after they won back {{control of the}} Senate in 1967.|$|E
5000|$|Cleveland finally overcame Hill's {{opposition}} by nominating Edward Douglass White of Louisiana. [...] White was {{a sitting}} Senator, and <b>Senatorial</b> <b>courtesy</b> dictated that the Senate not reject {{one of its}} own. [...] White's nomination was approved; he served as an Associate Justice until 1910, and as Chief Justice {{until his death in}} 1921.|$|E
50|$|In 1954, Governor Robert B. Meyner {{appointed}} him New Jersey Attorney General. Meyner nominated {{him for a}} second term in January 1958, but Albert McCay, the State Senator from Richman's home county of Burlington, exercised his right of <b>senatorial</b> <b>courtesy</b> and opposed the renomination. Despite Meyner's efforts to continue pushing through the appointment, Richman withdrew his name from consideration.|$|E
5000|$|By the {{tradition}} of <b>Senatorial</b> <b>courtesy,</b> other Senators generally deferred to a nominee's home state senators when evaluating a presidential nomination. [...] The Senators from New York were Edward Murphy, Jr. and David B. Hill; [...] Hill objected to Cleveland's nominations, and most other Senators supported Hill. [...] Hill was a rival of Cleveland's who had lost the Democratic nomination for President to him in 1892.|$|E
5000|$|In 1968, Johnston {{was elected}} at-large to the Louisiana State Senate, along with fellow Democrats Jackson B. Davis and Joe LeSage. One of the {{candidates}} that he defeated was the Republican Tom Stagg, later a judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana in Shreveport. Under <b>senatorial</b> <b>courtesy,</b> Johnston could have blocked Stagg's confirmation but did not do so.|$|E
5000|$|The {{nomination}} of Joel Jacobson, the state Energy Commissioner {{and a former}} labor leader, to the New Jersey Casino Control Commission in 1981, was blocked by Senator James Wallwork (R-Essex). Governor Brendan Byrne orchestrated an end-run around <b>Senatorial</b> <b>Courtesy</b> and Jacobson moved from Essex County to Ocean County, where Senator John F. Russo (D-Ocean) signed off, allowing Jacobson to be confirmed by the Democratic-controlled Senate.|$|E
50|$|In 1972, Epstein wanted Leslie Glick, an ex-Assistant Union County Prosecutor, {{to get a}} Superior Court Judgeship, but Governor William Cahill instead {{nominated}} Stephen Bercik, {{a former}} Mayor of Elizabeth. Epstein escalated his feud with Cahill by using <b>Senatorial</b> <b>Courtesy</b> to block the reappointment of former New York Stock Exchange Chairman James C. Kellogg III for reappointment as a Commissioner of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.|$|E
50|$|<b>Senatorial</b> <b>courtesy</b> is {{an unwritten}} rule {{practiced in the}} Senate of the U.S. state of New Jersey under which a State Senator can indefinitely block {{consideration}} of a nomination by the Governor of New Jersey for a gubernatorial nominee from the Senator's home county, without being required to provide an explanation. While the practice is infrequently invoked, it has brought calls for legislation that would forbid its use.|$|E
5000|$|Dorsey made {{efforts in}} 1993 to block Governor of New Jersey James Florio's reappointment of Judge Marianne Espinosa Murphy of the Family Court. Dorsey invoked [...] "senatorial courtesy", an unwritten rule under which Senators from a gubernatorial appointee's home county can block {{consideration}} {{of a candidate}} from that county. Dorsey indicated that he had received complaints about Judge Murphy that she [...] "giggles and throws pencils on the desk during testimony", though she {{was viewed as a}} model judge by an advocacy group for custodial parents who said that she would actively enforce judgments against deadbeat parents and was endorsed by the New Jersey State Bar Association, which had had a longstanding objection to the use of <b>senatorial</b> <b>courtesy.</b> Dorsey was one of three Republican State Senators to lose their seats in the 1993 general election, falling to Democratic former Assemblymember Gordon MacInnes by 607 votes. His loss was attributed to his use of <b>senatorial</b> <b>courtesy</b> to block Judge Murphy. Regardless of his departure from the senate, Dorsey has been viewed as a success in his political career and law career.|$|E
5000|$|The renomination of Superior Court Judge Sylvia Pressler in 1983 {{was blocked}} by Senator Gerald Cardinale (R-Bergen), who {{disagreed}} with many of her judicial rulings during the previous seven years. State Senator Gerald Cardinale attempted to block her reappointment to the Superior Court by invoking <b>senatorial</b> <b>courtesy.</b> Senate President Carmen A. Orechio removed Cardinale's ability to block her nomination, citing {{the fact that he}} had previously appeared before Judge Pressler in a legal matter, and her nomination was approved.|$|E
50|$|On June 8, 1976, President Gerald Ford {{nominated}} Kovachevich {{to a seat}} on {{a federal}} district court, according to an October 12, 1976 memo to Ford by his personnel director, Douglas Bennett. The United States Senate never acted on Kovachevich's nomination before Ford's presidency ended. Her nomination was blocked through a custom known as <b>senatorial</b> <b>courtesy</b> because the Democratic Party-controlled the Senate, and Florida's Senators, Lawton Chiles and Richard Stone, Democrats, opposed her confirmation. Ford's successor, President Jimmy Carter, elected not to renominate Kovachevich.|$|E
5000|$|The renomination of Superior Court Judge Marianne Espinosa Murphy, {{then the}} wife of Morris County Prosecutor Michael Murphy and the daughter-in-law of former Governor and Chief Justice Richard J. Hughes, was blocked in 1993 by Senate Majority Leader John H. Dorsey (R-Boonton). Despite {{endorsements}} from the New Jersey State Bar Association and advocacy groups for custodial parents, Dorsey indicated that he had received complaints that she [...] "giggles and throws pencils on the desk during testimony". This created a controversy. Dorsey eventually relented to some degree and stated that he would agree to allow Judge Murphy to be appointed to a new, untenured seven-year term. Judge Murphy declined {{on the grounds that}} the process of refusing her an untenured term without a hearing in the Senate posed a threat to judicial independence. Dorsey's use of <b>Senatorial</b> <b>courtesy</b> was the impetus behind a challenge in the 1993 Republican State Senate primary by a politically unknown lawyer, Chris Christie; Christie's campaign ended when his nominating petitions were invalidated for not having enough signatures. After Dorsey's defeat, Senate President Donald DiFrancesco (R-Union) amended the unwritten <b>Senatorial</b> <b>Courtesy</b> rule so as not to apply to any sitting Judge who was renominated by the Governor.|$|E
50|$|In April 2013, about 10 {{percent of}} federal seats were vacant, with 85 of 856 {{positions}} unfilled and 4 vacancies on the prestigious Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The high vacancy rate has {{been attributed to}} politics, particularly Senate filibustering of potential appointees by Senators. In many cases there is no nominee for the position; however, the Senate has a tradition of <b>senatorial</b> <b>courtesy</b> in which nominees are only considered if the home senators approve. In May 2013 Congressional Research Service published a paper analyzing the vacancies and appointment process.|$|E
50|$|In 1958, McCay used <b>Senatorial</b> <b>courtesy</b> {{to block}} the renomination of New Jersey Attorney General Grover C. Richman Jr., refusing {{to explain why he}} was unwilling to allow Richman to be renominated to a second {{four-year}} term as Attorney General and stating that he would only disclose his justifications if he was granted subpoena power to compel the testimony of uncooperative witnesses who would be able to confirm his claims. Despite sharp criticism from Governor Robert B. Meyner, McCay held firm and the Senate backed him up, leading Richman to withdraw his name from consideration.|$|E
5000|$|The Caucus System, {{used by the}} New Jersey State Senate between 1949 and 1966, {{and again}} from 1968 to 1974, was a rule {{utilized}} by Republicans that no bill could advance to the Senate floor for a vote unless a majority {{of members of the}} majority caucus supported it. Decisions were made in virtual secrecy in private party caucus meetings attended only by the Senators of the majority party, [...] The Caucus System is different from <b>Senatorial</b> <b>Courtesy,</b> which allowed any Senator to block a gubernatorial appointment from his or her home county.|$|E
5000|$|Campbell {{took office}} {{as head of}} the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection in January 2002, having been {{nominated}} to the post by Governor Jim McGreevey. In October 2004 Senator Anthony Bucco of Morris County invoked <b>senatorial</b> <b>courtesy</b> to block four nominations to the Highlands Commission. Bucco sought to register his concern about how the Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act would limit development in the New Jersey Highlands, and dropped his block after Campbell met with Bucco, Senator Guy R. Gregg and the mayors of several municipalities in Morris County, with Bucco saying [...] "All I wanted was my day in court".|$|E
5000|$|Senator Anthony Bucco of Morris County used <b>senatorial</b> <b>courtesy</b> in 2004 {{to block}} four {{nominations}} to the Highlands Commission {{until he could}} {{have an opportunity to}} meet with Bradley M.

5000|$|<b>Senatorial</b> <b>courtesy</b> is {{a long-standing}} unwritten, unofficial, and nonbinding {{political}} custom (or constitutional convention) in the United States describing {{the tendency of}} U.S. senators to support a Senate colleague in opposing the appointment to federal office of a presidential nominee from that Senator's state. The practice is motivated by a general sense of collegiality among Senators and the assumption that a Senate colleague will have the best first-hand knowledge of the personal character and qualifications of nominees {{from his or her}} own state. It is also viewed as an [...] "important source of political patronage" [...] for U.S. senators.|$|E
50|$|In 1961, Governor Robert B. Meyner {{planned to}} {{nominate}} Plainfield attorney William Phillmore Wood {{as the first}} Black {{to serve on the}} New Jersey Superior Court. Crane opposed the nomination, saying he did not view Wood as qualified. As the Senator from Wood's home county, Crane used <b>Senatorial</b> <b>Courtesy</b> to block the nomination from coming to a vote by the full Senate. As a compromise, Meyner nominated Wood to the County Court, a lower judicial post. The Superior Court judgeship went to Crane's choice, Milton Feller, a County Court Judge and a former Republican Assemblyman and Elizabeth City Councilman. Wood was then nominated to Feller's seat.|$|E

50|$|Governor Corzine {{nominated}} Stuart Rabner on June 4, 2007, to be {{the next}} Chief Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court, replacing James R. Zazzali, who was nearing mandatory retirement age. Shortly after the nomination, two members of the Senate from Essex County, where Rabner resides, blocked consideration of his confirmation by invoking <b>senatorial</b> <b>courtesy.</b> State Senator Ronald Rice had initially blocked the nomination, but relented on June 15, 2007, after a meeting with the governor. Nia Gill dropped her block on June 19, 2007, but did not explain the nature of her concerns, though anonymous lawmakers cited in The New York Times indicated that the objection was due to Rabner's race and Governor Corzine's failure to consider a minority candidate for the post.|$|E
50|$|In 1933 Byrd was {{appointed}} to fill a vacancy in the United States Senate; he won reelection as a Democrat in 1933, 1934, 1940, 1946, 1952, 1958, and 1964.

Judge Pressler died on February 15, 2010, following a battle with lymphoma at her home in Sparta Township, New Jersey, at the age of 75. She was survived by her husband, David Pressler and their two children and three grandchildren.|$|E
50|$|Christie {{nominated}} Timpone, a Democrat, for the NJ Supreme Court in April 2016, withdrawing his February 2016 {{nomination of}} David F. Bauman, a Republican. The selection {{to fill a}} long-vacant seat on court has been matter of controversy about the political composition of the court since the governor's first term. Timpone's identification as a Democrat made the nomination more palatable to the New Jersey Senate, which conducts confirmation hearings. Christie {{said he would have}} preferred a Republican, but relieved that the controversy would be settled. As unwritten rule and <b>senatorial</b> <b>courtesy,</b> Timpone met with each of Union County's state senators Nicholas Scutari (D), Ray Lesniak (D), Tom Kean, Jr. (R). After meeting with the Senate Judiciary Committee, he was confirmed by the full New Jersey Senate on April 26, 2016. He was sworn-in May 2, 2016.|$|E
