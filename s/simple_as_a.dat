50|$|HSM {{may also}} be used where more robust storage is {{available}} for long-term archiving, but this is slow to access. This may be <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> off-site backup, for protection against a building fire.|$|R
25|$|The {{separator}} {{separates the}} coated workpieces from the medium after coating. It {{can be as}} <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> screen with water nozzles or as complicated as a vibratory system with magnetic separators. A medium handling machine then takes the separated medium and transports it to a storage tank for reuse.|$|E
25|$|The {{components}} of an operating system all exist {{in order to}} make the different parts of a computer work together. All user software needs to go through the operating system in order to use any of the hardware, whether it be as <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mouse or keyboard or as complex as an Internet component.|$|E
25|$|A rocket design {{can be as}} <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{cardboard}} tube {{filled with}} black powder, but to make an efficient, accurate rocket or missile involves overcoming a number of difficult problems. The main difficulties include cooling the combustion chamber, pumping the fuel (in {{the case of a}} liquid fuel), and controlling and correcting the direction of motion.|$|E
5|$|Loitering munitions may be <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{unmanned}} aerial vehicle (UAV) with attached explosives that is sent on {{a potential}} kamikaze mission, and may even be constructed with off the shelf commercial quadcopters with strapped on explosives.|$|R
50|$|A dry box is {{a storage}} {{container}} {{in which the}} interior is kept at {{a low level of}} humidity. It may be <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> airtight and watertight enclosure, or it may use active means to remove water vapor from the air trapped inside.|$|R
50|$|Controls are {{necessary}} to regulate every aspect of an air handler, such as: flow rate of air, supply air temperature, mixed air temperature, humidity, air quality. They may be <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> off/on thermostat or <b>as</b> complex <b>as</b> <b>a</b> building automation system using BACnet or LonWorks, for example.|$|R
25|$|All {{persons and}} goods {{entering}} Canada are subject to examination by CBSA officers. An examination can be as <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> few questions, but can also include {{an examination of the}} subject's vehicle and/or luggage, more intensive questioning, or personal searches. The intensity of an examination depends on the reasonable grounds that the officer has to escalate the intensiveness of a search.|$|E
25|$|In its {{earliest}} attestation, cooking {{was done by}} roasting meat and tubers in an open fire. Pottery and other cooking vessels may be placed directly on an open fire, but setting the vessel on a support, as <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> base of three stones, resulted in a stove. The three-stone stove is still widely used around the world. In some areas it developed into a U-shaped dried mud or brick enclosure with the opening in the front for fuel and air, sometimes with a second smaller hole at the rear.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} form of degradation, however, is a {{decrease}} in polymer chain length. Mechanisms which break polymer chains are familiar to biologists because of their effect on DNA: ionizing radiation (most commonly ultraviolet light), free radicals, and oxidizers such as oxygen, ozone, and chlorine. Ozone cracking is a well-known problem affecting natural rubber for example. Plastic additives can slow these process very effectively, and can be as <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> UV-absorbing pigment (e.g. titanium dioxide or carbon black). Plastic shopping bags often do not include these additives so that they break down more easily as ultrafine particles of litter.|$|E
50|$|Surface {{exploration}} {{can include}} geologic mapping, geophysical methods, and photogrammetry; {{or it can}} be <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> engineer walking around to observe the physical conditions at the site.

The transaction can be <b>as</b> <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> email address. On the other hand, CPA campaigns are usually low volume and complex. Typically, consumer has to submit {{credit card and}} other detailed information.|$|R
25|$|Hardware {{interrupts}} are signalled to the CPU {{using three}} inputs that encode the highest pending interrupt priority. A separate Encoder is usually required to encode the interrupts, though for systems {{that do not}} require more than three hardware interrupts it is possible to connect the interrupt signals directly to the encoded inputs at the cost of additional software complexity. The interrupt controller can be as <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> 74LS148 priority encoder, or may be part of a VLSI peripheral chip such as the MC68901 Multi-Function Peripheral (used in the Atari ST range of computers and Sharp X68000), which also provided a UART, timer, and parallel I/O.|$|E
25|$|If a {{responder}} begins rendering aid, he {{must not}} leave the scene until {{it is necessary to}} call for needed medical assistance, a rescuer of equal or higher ability takes over, or continuing to give aid is unsafe. This can be as <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> lack of adequate protection against potential diseases, such as vinyl, latex, or nitrile gloves to protect against blood-borne pathogens. A responder is never legally compelled to take risks to aid another person. The responder is not legally liable for any harm to the person assisted, as long as the responder acted rationally, in good faith and in accordance with their level of training.|$|E
500|$|In July 1840 he {{attempted}} to fuse his desire to make money with his politics by founding a magazine called the Revue Parisienne, funded by his friend Armand Dutacq. Having already worked in the publishing industry, Balzac believed he had learned {{all there was to}} know about the trade. [...] "hat gigantic machine known as journalism", he wrote, [...] "is as <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> roasting spit turned by a poodle." [...] Balzac planned to publish his own fiction in the Revue Parisienne, in part to challenge the popularity of the roman-feuilleton serial format. Dutacq, however, stopped funding the project in September, after only three issues, and Balzac's final foray into the world of publishing came to an end.|$|E
50|$|An {{equivalent}} {{definition of}} a simple Lie group follows from the Lie correspondence: a connected Lie group is simple if its Lie algebra is simple. An important technical point is thata simple Lie group may contain discrete normal subgroups, hence being a simple Lie group is different from being <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> abstract group.|$|R
5000|$|The {{detector}} stage recovers {{the information from}} the radio-frequency signal, and produces the sound, video, or data that was impressed on the carrier wave initially.

500|$|Additionally, Mars {{performed}} on the Late Show with David Letterman, on November 11, 2010, with a soul redemption of [...] "Grenade" [...] accompanied by an all-female string section. Robbie Draw from website Idolator wrote a positive review, commenting [...] "Bruno Mars hit up the Late Show With David Letterman last night and left {{a piece of his}} heart on the stage after turning out an emotional, bluesy rendition of his new single “Grenade”". Story Gilmore of Neon Limelight also praised the performance, calling it [...] "nothing short of awesome" [...] and noticed that Mars [...] "takes this performing thing seriously. Even when he’s doing something as <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> late night show performance, he makes sure he’s on his A game". The song was performed at NBC’s The Today Show on November 22, 2010, as part of the Toyota Concert Series and at the 2010 Soul Train Music Awards on November 28, 2010. On January 6, 2011, Mars performed [...] "Grenade" [...] on The Ellen DeGeneres Show with a guitar, [...] "backed by three background singers, a strings section, and pianist". He also performed the song on the Dutch television show The Voice of Holland on January 21, 2011. On February 13, 2011 he performed the song live at the 2011 Grammy Awards, along with B.o.B. and Janelle Monáe. In Germany, Mars performed [...] "Grenade" [...] on two different shows Wetten, dass..? and at the Echo Awards, on 19 and 28 March 2011, respectively. It was the eleventh song of his debut worldwide tour, The Doo-Wops & Hooligans Tour (2011-12) and was thirteenth or tenth on the set list of his second tour, The Moonshine Jungle Tour (2013-14). On his third tour, the 24K Magic World Tour (2017-18), it was also the thirteenth item on the setlist.|$|E
2500|$|Tools {{to monitor}} the {{performance}} of the software as it is running, either specifically to find problems such as bottlenecks or to give assurance as to correct working, may be embedded in the code explicitly (perhaps as <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> statement saying PRINT [...] "I AM HERE"), or provided as tools. It is often a surprise to find where most of the time is taken by a piece of code, and this removal of assumptions might cause the code to be rewritten.|$|E

Desperate, Kubera rushed to mount Kailasa to ask Shiva to remedy the situation. The Lord then gave him a handful of roasted rice, saying that something as <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> handful of roasted rice would satiate Ganesha, if it were offered with humility and love. Ganesha had swallowed up almost the entire city when Kubera finally arrived and humbly gave him the rice. With that, Ganesha was finally satisfied and calmed.|$|E

Simultaneously, Camill (the last remaining of [...] "the Baker's Dozen") appears at his observation tower and tells him to leave it and fly south immediately. Sklyarov refuses to leave precious ulmotrons behind and urges Camill for help but when the wind front preceding the Wave strikes, the falling machinery seemingly kills Camill. Terrified Sklyarov flees south.|$|E
2500|$|A sound {{reinforcement}} {{system for}} a rock concert in a stadium may be very complex, including hundreds of microphones, complex live sound mixing and signal processing systems, {{tens of thousands of}} watts of amplifier power, and multiple loudspeaker arrays, all overseen by a team of audio engineers and technicians. On the other hand, a sound reinforcement system can be as <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> small public address (PA) system, consisting of, for example, a single microphone connected to a 100 watt amplified loudspeaker for a singer-guitarist playing in a small coffeehouse. [...] In both cases, these systems reinforce sound to make it louder or distribute it to a wider audience.|$|E
2500|$|In {{software}} development projects, a [...] "mistake" [...] or [...] "fault" [...] may be introduced at any stage. Bugs arise from oversights or misunderstandings {{made by a}} software team during specification, design, coding, data entry or documentation. For example, a relatively simple program to alphabetize a list of words, the design might fail to consider what should happen when a word contains a hyphen. Or when converting an abstract design into code, the coder might inadvertently create an off-by-one error and fail to sort {{the last word in}} a list. Errors may be as <b>simple</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> typing error: a [...] "<" [...] where a [...] ">" [...] was intended.|$|E
