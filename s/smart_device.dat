25|$|The Pokémon Go Plus is a Bluetooth {{low energy}} {{wearable}} device, developed by Nintendo's Platform Technology Development division, that allows players to perform certain {{actions in the}} game without looking at their <b>smart</b> <b>device.</b> When a player is near a Pokémon or PokéStop, the Plus vibrates. The player can then press the button to capture the Pokémon or receive items from the PokéStop; the player cannot check what they have received until {{the next time they}} sign into the app on their mobile device. The design consists of a Poké Ball and the shape of the Google Maps pin. The decision to create the device rather than create a smart watch app was to increase uptake among players for whom a smart watch is prohibitively expensive. It was released in the United Kingdom and North America on September 16, 2016.|$|E

50|$|Although <b>smart</b> <b>devices</b> {{partially}} {{overlap in}} definition with {{specific types of}} appliance such as information appliances, <b>smart</b> <b>devices</b> are characterised and differ in several key ways. First, <b>smart</b> <b>devices</b> in general can take a much wider range of form-factors than appliances. Second, <b>smart</b> <b>devices</b> support the ubiquitous computing properties. Third information appliances focus on remote interaction with computing environments that tend to be personalised whereas <b>smart</b> <b>devices</b> can also focus heavily on impersonal physical world interaction. Four, the term appliance generally implies that devices are task specific and {{under the control of}} some embedded system or application specific operating system, whereas <b>smart</b> <b>devices</b> may support multiple tasks, e.g., a mobile phone can act as a phone but also as a games console, music player, camera, etc.|$|R
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{telecommunication}} technology {{has led to the}} development of many <b>smart</b> <b>devices.</b> In particular, the smartphone market has been growing rapidly following the development of third-generation telecommunication technology. As a result, most people are expected to use a smartphone within a few years. Furthermore, the market for <b>smart</b> <b>devices</b> such as tablets and smart TVs are growing rapidly. Therefore, most people are expected to own various <b>smart</b> <b>devices</b> within a few years. However, current Web services are focused on a desktop PC platform, which can be problematic for <b>smart</b> <b>devices.</b> In this paper, we analyze the performance of Web browsing speed in <b>smart</b> mobile <b>devices</b> with the goal of providing Web services customized for <b>smart</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R

50|$|In Implicit {{authentication}} (IA), user behaviors (raw) {{data are}} captured by various sensors {{embedded in the}} <b>smart</b> <b>device,</b> and stored in the database preparing for further processing. After filtering out noise and selecting suitable features, the data {{will be sent to}} machine learning tool(s) which will train and return a fine-tuned model back to <b>smart</b> <b>device.</b> The <b>smart</b> <b>device</b> then uses the model as signature to identify the current user. Due to the battery and computation limitation of <b>smart</b> <b>device,</b> the training phase, in which most of the computations are carried out, is usually implemented in the remote server. Some lightweight algorithms, e.g., Kl divergence, are implemented in the local device as parts of real-time authentication units which control lock mechanism of the device.|$|E
