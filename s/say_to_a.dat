500|$|The name of Ragnall's wife, [...] "Fonia", as {{recorded}} in their grant to the priory of Paisley, {{may be an}} attempt to represent the Gaelic name Findguala in Latin. According to late Hebridean tradition, preserved in the garbled Sleat History, Ragnall was married to [...] "MacRandel's daughter, or, as some <b>say,</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> sister of Thomas Randel, Earl of Murray". This tradition cannot be correct due to its chronology, since Thomas Randolph, the first Earl of Moray, and his like-named son and successor, both died in 1332. One possibility, however, is that the tradition may instead refer to an earlier earl—Uilleam mac Donnchada (died 1151–1154). If so, Ragnall's son, Domnall, may have been named after Uilleam's son, Domnall (died 1187). The latter was a leading member of the meic Uilleim, a kindred who were in open conflict against the Scottish kings from the late twelfth- to early thirteenth centuries.|$|E

The singer wanted to make a song with Spanish influences, in order to pay homage for her Spanish mother. During a day in the studio, they came up with a melody but did not have any words. Then she called her mother for help. Halliwell {{recalled}} asking her, [...] "Mum, what do you <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> bloke in Spanish if you fancy him and are being romantic?" [...] Her mother then said she did not remember that. So she asked her look at her library of Spanish language romances, and she read the titles out to Halliwell. Eventually she came out with [...] "¿Dónde está el hombre con fuego en la sangre?" [...] ("Where is the man with fire in his blood?" [...] in English), and she liked the way it sounded, and included the line {{at the beginning of the}} song.

500|$|At {{the heart}} of this scene is Cable's song [...] "You've Got to Be Carefully Taught", in which Cable realizes the sources of his own racism. [...] Its frank lyrics made it perhaps the most {{controversial}} element of the show. Michener recalled in his memoirs that a delegation of New Englanders had approached him after a New Haven tryout and urged him to recommend the song's removal to Rodgers and Hammerstein. [...] When Michener told Hammerstein, he laughed and replied, [...] "That's what the show is about!" [...] Boston drama critic Elliot Norton, after seeing the show in tryouts, strongly recommended its removal, or at least that Cable sing it less [...] "briskly", as there was much bigotry in Boston; Logan replied that that was all the more reason for leaving it unaltered. Several New York reviewers expressed discomfort with the song; Wolcott Gibbs wrote of [...] "something called 'You've Got to Be Taught', a poem in praise of tolerance that somehow I found a little embarrassing" [...] while John Mason Brown opined that he was [...] "somewhat distressed by the dragged-in didacticism of such a plea for tolerance as 'You've Got to Be Taught'". After the Broadway opening, Hammerstein received a large number of letters concerning [...] "You've Got to Be Carefully Taught". [...] Judging by the letters that remain among his papers in the Library of Congress, the reaction was mixed. One correspondent wrote [...] "What can I <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> man who writes, 'You've got to be taught to hate and fear?'... Now that I know you, I feel that my informants didn't praise you enough." [...] Nevertheless, another wrote, [...] "I feel the inclusion of the song particularly in the album and to some extent in the show itself is not helpful to the cause of brotherhood, your intent to the contrary notwithstanding".|$|E

Playing Aidan Quinn's son in Avalon and Tin Men garnered professional attention for Wood; Avalon received widespread critical acclaim and was nominated for four Academy Awards. A small part in Richard Gere's Internal Affairs was followed by the role of a boy who brings estranged couple Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson back together in Paradise (1991).

The fan was stunned at first but later thanked him (though some sources say it went differently).

2500|$|A {{campaign}} was started on 1 May 2007 by the Parkour.NET portal to preserve parkour's philosophy against sports competition and rivalry. In {{the words of}} Erwan Le Corre: [...] "Competition pushes people to fight against others for the satisfaction of a crowd and/or {{the benefits of a}} few business people by changing its mindset. Parkour is unique and cannot be a competitive sport unless it ignores its altruistic core of self-development. If parkour becomes a sport, {{it will be hard to}} seriously teach and spread parkour as a non-competitive activity. And a new sport will be spread that may be called parkour, but that won't hold its philosophical essence anymore." [...] Red Bull's sponsored athlete for parkour, Ryan Doyle, has said, [...] "Sometimes people ask, 'Who is the best at parkour?' and it is because they don't understand what Parkour is; 'Who is the best?' is what you would <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> sport, and parkour is not a sport, it is an art, it's a discipline. That's like saying, 'What's the best song in the world?'" [...] This seems to be a highly consensual opinion of many professional traceurs who view parkour as a style of life more than a set of tricks, as has been popularised by YouTube and most media exposure.|$|E
2500|$|In {{certain parts}} of Latin America, the usage of negro to {{directly}} address black people can be colloquial. It {{is important to understand}} that this is not similar {{to the use of the}} word nigga in English in urban hip hop subculture in the United States, given that [...] "negro" [...] is not a racist term. For example, one might <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> friend, [...] " [...] (literally 'Hey, black-one, how are you doing?'). In such a case, the diminutive [...] can also be used, as a term of endearment meaning 'pal'/'buddy'/'friend'. [...] has thus also come to be used to refer to a person of any ethnicity or color, and also can have a sentimental or romantic connotation similar to 'sweetheart' or 'dear' in English. (However, in the Philippines negrito was used for a local dark-skinned, short population native to Luzon and the Visayas islands among other places; this is the meaning of Negrito in English.) In other Spanish-speaking South American countries, the word [...] can also be employed in a roughly equivalent term-of-endearment form, though it is not usually considered to be as widespread as in Argentina or Uruguay (except perhaps in a limited regional and/or social context). [...] It is consequently occasionally encountered, due to the influence of nigga, in Chicano English in the United States.|$|E

And I drove around this little English Hillman Minx—top down—and every night I'd be hauled over by the cops. Up against the wall, and all this stuff. They had this monologue with me; it was never a dialogue. It was that I was a long-haired drug addict living off some rich guy's foolish daughter. And I said, [...] "No, I work in advertising.

I suddenly felt what it was like to be a black or Mexican kid living in L.A.
