5|$|The {{first series}} of Spooks saw various storylines {{involving}} the main characters. Among these were Danny's obsession {{with money and}} spending, by hacking into a credit card database to fool it {{to give him a}} better credit rating, and the discovery that Tessa is running phantom agents to pocket their money. Those storylines were intended by Brenton and Wolstencroft to show the audience that the MI5 officers are tempted by money. A principle story arc is Tom dealing with the complexities of his relationship with Ellie, who at first does not know he is a spy. This storyline was based on Mike Baker, whose wife did not know he was a spy {{for the first six months}} they were together. As the series progressed, there were more difficulties with the relationship; Brenton wrote Tom's position as if the character did not <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> The same episode also introduced the sexual tension between Danny and Zoe.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{intensely}} closeted {{nature of}} Miami's gay community at that time, many voters {{who were not}} swayed by Bryant's rhetoric were persuaded instead by her campaign's point that the law was unnecessary; {{they were unable to}} <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of discrimination. Unlike blacks or Cubans, gay men and lesbians were able to find jobs, although they faced dismissal upon their supervisors learning of their sexual orientation. In order to see a complaint through, they would have to remain out, and many lived in constant fear of exposure. Since the advent of second wave feminism earlier in the decade, many lesbians in the U.S. were unable to see themselves as part of the same community with gay men. Accusations from Save Our Children were almost all directed at the behavior of men. As a result, much of the response by gay men was angry and many lesbians took issue with the misogynistic tone gay men used. However, with Bryant representing a common adversary, {{for the first time in}} years, gay men and lesbians united to work together on the campaign.|$|E

2500|$|U.S. Congressman and 2012 Republican presidential {{candidate}} Ron Paul (R-TX) stated, [...] "If they were demonstrating peacefully, {{and making a}} point, and arguing our case, and drawing attention to the Fed—I would say, 'good!'" [...] In a GOP debate, mentioning the ongoing “Occupy Wall Street” protesters, he stated that crony capitalists are those “that benefit from contract from government, benefit from the Federal Reserve, benefit from all the bailouts. They don’t deserve compassion. They deserve taxation or they deserve to have all their benefits removed." [...] When protesters conducted a 'mic check,' at one of Ron Paul's rallies, he replied, [...] "If you listen carefully, I'm very much involved with the 99. I've been condemning that 1% because they've been ripping us off. The people on Wall Street got the bailouts and you guys got stuck with the bills and that's where I <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> is." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some FEE-based {{analyses}} {{suggest that}} the famine {{was a result of}} policy failure or bungling. Others assert that prioritised distribution and the denial policies reflected the War Cabinet's callous willingness to [...] "supply the Army's needs and let the Indian people starve if necessary" [...] when weighing how to allocate wartime resources. In this view, economic policies were designed to serve externally oriented British military goals at the expense of internally oriented Indian interests, and so the UK government bears moral responsibility for the rural deaths. [...] The policies may have met their intended goals, but only at the cost of harrowing, large-scale dislocations in the domestic economy. Far from being accidental, this argument maintains, these dislocations were fully recognised beforehand as fatal for identifiable Indian groups whose economic activities did not directly, actively, or adequately advance military goals. The analysts split into two broad camps: those who think the government unwittingly caused or was unable to respond to the crisis, and those who think it willfully ignored the plight of starving Indians. The former <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> as a series of avoidable war-time policy failures and [...] "panicky responses" [...] from a government that was spectacularly inept, overwhelmed and in disarray, the latter as a conscious miscarriage of justice by the [...] "ruling colonial elite" [...] who abandoned the poor of Bengal.|$|E

2500|$|Besides {{the need}} to be thin, young, and rich, there is also a weight {{prejudice}} within our society that is brought up in media, social settings, with friends, or even by parents. The tendency to link physical attractive qualities with positive personal qualities has been documented since the 1970s. People assign positive personality traits and overall life outcomes to those they perceive as attractive both mentally and physically. These high standards for women to follow and live up to mixed with the practical impossibilities of achieving such standards develops an attitude from women that thinness is extremely desirable. Even the average size of clothing women wear has changed drastically within the past decades, as a size 8 used to be considered small to average and is now nearly plus size. [...] Actress/Comedian Amy Schummer spoke out on the issue of size when she was featured in Glamour Magazine as a [...] "Plus Size Woman." [...] Upon the magazines publication, Schummer fired a tweet saying, [...] "I think there's nothing wrong with being plus size. Beautiful healthy women. Plus size is considered size 16 in America. I go between a size 6 and a 8." [...] Women who value this idea of having to be extremely thin and a size 2 or 4 have body dissatisfaction, and take part in cosmetic surgeries or weight loss behaviors (such as dieting) to try to become the standard that they so commonly <b>see.</b> <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> in which people, specifically women, are constantly comparing themselves to the people and images in the media leads to individuals believing they are more overweight than they actually are.|$|E

60|$|Intellect and intellection signify to {{the common}} ear {{consideration}} of abstract truth. The considerations of time and place, of you and me, of profit and hurt tyrannize over most men's minds. Intellect separates the fact considered, from you, from all local and personal reference, and discerns {{it as if it}} existed for its own sake. Heraclitus looked upon the affections as dense and colored mists. In the fog of good and evil affections it is hard for man to walk forward in a straight line. Intellect is void of affection and sees an object as it stands in the light of science, cool and disengaged. The intellect goes out of the individual, floats over its own personality, and regards it as a fact, and not as I and mine. He who is immersed in what concerns person or place cannot <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> of existence. This the intellect always ponders. Nature shows all things formed and bound. The intellect pierces the form, overleaps the wall, detects intrinsic likeness between remote things and reduces all things into a few principles.|$|E
