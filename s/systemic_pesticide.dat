50|$|Imidacloprid is a nicotine-derived {{systemic}} insecticide, {{belonging to}} a group of pesticides called neonicotinoids. Although it is off patent, the primary producer of imidacloprid is the German chemical firm Bayer CropScience. The trade names for imidacloprid include Gaucho, Admire, Merit, Advantage, Confidor, Provado, and Winner. Imidacloprid is a neurotoxin that is selectively toxic to insects relative to vertebrates and most non-insect invertebrates. It acts as an agonist on the postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of motor neurones in insects. This interaction results in convulsions, paralysis, and eventually death of the poisoned insect. It is effective on contact and via stomach action. Because imidacloprid binds much more strongly to insect neuron receptors than to mammal neuron receptors, this insecticide is selectively more toxic to insects than mammals. As a <b>systemic</b> <b>pesticide,</b> imidacloprid translocates or moves readily in the xylem of plants from the soil into the leaves, fruit, flowers, pollen, nectar, and guttation fluid of plants. Bees may be exposed to imidacloprid when they feed on the nectar, pollen, and guttation fluid of imidacloprid-treated plants.|$|E

Microscopic insights and next-generation sequencing combined with bioinformatics allow us now to identify new functions and interactions of plant-associated bacteria and perceive plants as meta-organisms. Host symbiotic, rhizo-epiphytic, endophytic microorganisms and their functions on plants have not been studied yet in accordance with uptake, tanslocation and action of pesticides. Root tips exudates mediated by rhizobacteria could modify the uptake of specific pesticides while bacterial ligands and enzymes can affect metabolism and fate of pesticide within plant. Over expression of specific proteins in cell membrane can also modify pesticide influx in roots.

50|$|Several {{kinds of}} {{management}} {{exist for the}} prevention and suppression of disease. A cultural method that can be effective in preventing disease is sanitation. Equipment should be cleaned after use in infested fields so the disease does not spread into uninfested fields. To disrupt chlamydospore germination crops should be grown in drained disease free soil. Also, avoid transplanting without thorough knowledge of the transplant. To limit spread of structures limit traffic in infected fields and always clean after exposure. Disease is favored by pH values greater than 6.2, so lowering the pH is an effective method for preventing germination. pH management can be difficult because tobacco cannot survive in very low pH soils. Soil pH 5.5 to 6 allow successful growth of tobacco and control of disease. The cultural control, Crop rotation, is very effective at limiting disease. The longer an infected field is planted in a crop other than the initial infected crop, the lower the population will become. A minimum three year rotation is recommended. Crop rotation is recommended in combination with resistant varieties as genetic controls. Burley Tobacco, Burley Tobacco hybrids, and Dark Tobacco are varieties of tobacco that are resistant to Black Shank. Resistance however is not reliable because a single variety has resistance to only a few races of Black Shank. Finding new lines of resistance is becoming increasingly important due to new discovered resistant races of the pathogen. Chemical control is most successful if used with resistant varieties. Metalaxyl or mefenoxam are chemistries used to control Phytophthora nicotianae. Ridomil Gold is an example a <b>systemic</b> <b>pesticide</b> with a Metalaxyl chemistry. Mefenoxam is twice as active as metalaxyl, but they both have the same mode of action. Successful chemical control is difficult because we are limited to these two chemistries that are basically identical. A study by Csinos and Bertrand found out {{at a rate of}} 3.36 kg/ha would not inhibit many of the common races used in their study. Overall, from their study they observed that Black Shank severity was increasing in Georgia due to Metalaxyl sensitivity and resistant races of Black Shank.|$|E

40|$|Background: Recent {{declines in}} honey bees for crop {{pollination}} threaten fruit, nut, vegetable and seed {{production in the}} United States. A broad survey of pesticide residues was conducted on samples from migratory and other beekeepers across 23 states, one Canadian province and several agricultural cropping systems during the 2007 – 08 growing seasons. Methodology/Principal Findings: We have used LC/MS-MS and GC/MS to analyze bees and hive matrices for pesticide residues utilizing a modified QuEChERS method. We have found 121 different pesticides and metabolites within 887 wax, pollen, bee and associated hive samples. Almost 60 % of the 259 wax and 350 pollen samples contained at least one <b>systemic</b> <b>pesticide,</b> and over 47 % had both in-hive acaricides fluvalinate and coumaphos, and chlorothalonil, a widely-used fungicide.

40|$|Aldicarb, 2 -methyl- 2 -(methylthio) propionaldehyde- 0 -methylcarbamoyloxime, is an oxime {{carbamate}} insecticide {{manufactured by}} the Union Carbide Corporation and sold under the trade name Temik. It is a soil-applied <b>systemic</b> <b>pesticide</b> used against certain insects, mites, and nematodes, and is applied below {{the soil surface}} for absorption by plant roots. It is generally applied to the soil {{in the form of}} 5, 10, or 15 % granules, and soil moisture is essential for the release of the toxicant. Uptake by plants is rapid. Aldicarb is currently registered for use on cotton, sugar beets, sugar cane (Louisiana only), potatoes, sweet potatoes, peanuts, oranges, pecans (Southeast only), dry beans, soybeans, and ornamental plants. Home and garden use is not permitted. Discovery of aldicarb and its oxidative sulfoxide and sulfone metabolites in well or ground water in Florida, Wisconsin, and New York, and accidental poisonings from ingesting contaminated watermelons and cucumbers in the South and West have spurred interest and concern about this pesticide. The primary mechanism of toxic action of aldicarb is cholinesterase inhibition. However, unlike the relatively irreversible anticholinesterase activity of the organophosphate pesticides, the carbamylation process which produces the anti-AChE action is quickly reversible. Aldicarb is readily absorbed through both the gut and the skin, but is rapidly metabolized and excreted in the urine almostly completely within 24 hr. Although it is acutely toxic to humans and laboratory animals, aldicarb is not known to be carcinogenic, teratogenic, conclusively mutagenic, or to produce other long-term adverse health effects. In cases of accidental poisoning, the cholinergic symptoms have generally subsided within 6 hr, with no side effects or complications...|$|E

The range of pesticides, and the detected concentrations of pesticides in poisoned honeybee samples, were reviewed.
