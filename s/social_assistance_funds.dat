40|$|On the {{instructions}} of the Aachen district council, the Institute of German Economy {{looked into the}} question as to why a steady loss of jobs for low qualified people has developed in the Aachen region {{and what can be done}} against this at a local level. The research programme consisted of an analysis of the region using secondary statistics, as well as an establishment survey, ergonomic case studies of companies, and intensive interviews with possible target groups of a policy for low qualified people. On the basis of the report, recommendations were made for the structuring of an employment policy at local level aimed at improving the reintegration of low qualified people into the labour market. The main results were: The majority of the present activities in the primary labour market and in particular in industry are now only formally and functionally low-skilled jobs. These activities have developed into skilled jobs as a result of further elements of activity being added to the existing ones and through clearly higher requirements regarding qualifications outside the field as well as core skills. Although low-skilled work does still exist, it is more and more rarely combined into jobs for low qualified people. Low-skilled activities are therefore under pressure from two sources - from rationalisation as well as from work enrichment. Many low qualified people are unable to stand up to this thrust towards professionalisation. In particular in the industrial sector this process is so advanced that it appears to be irreversible. The labour market pressure on low qualified people is the consequence of increased qualifi-cation demands in a labour market situation which companies already feel to be difficult. The companies do not see the direct collectively agreed wage costs as the main stress factor in the demand for labour but more the entire set of wage costs consisting of taxes, social security contributions and settlements. These factors have had a particularly negative effect for people with limited capacity to work and a lack of qualifications in cases when personal characteristics have increased the employment risk too considerably from the point of view of the companies. Without combating the basic general economic conditions for more employment, which are seen as negative, the prospects of success for a local-level initiative for more low-skilled jobs are very limited. Without 'extending' the labour market with additional jobs, the problem of a lack of low-skilled jobs cannot be solved. Additional employment potential can be seen above all in the service sector. For the region studied a gap in the service sector of some 30, 000 jobs can be deduced. But employment does not arise automatically in services since the number of jobs has grown only in company departments with high qualification requirements. In some low qualified services on the other hand, unemployment has increased sharply. An employment policy initiative to increase the number of low-skilled activities in the service sector must therefore take into consideration an intensification of work and enlargement of tasks. The most important source of financing for local-level employment activities is the activation of social assistance, an increasing part of which has to be paid out due to unemployment. All pilot projects of local-level employment policy are therefore to be financed in part by redirecting <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>funds.</b> In addition to this the Employment Promotion Act and the Federal Social Assistance Act should be better interlinked than has previously been the case. In particular the target group of low qualified people provides ample cause and opportunity for this. The activation of social assistance for employment policy could be realised using the following approaches: local government wage subsidies; topping up income from employment; reduced deduction of income from employment in calculating social assistance; hiring out of temporary workers; service agencies; service cheques; integration contracts; setting up of small enterprises; consultancy agencies.

30|$|The Haitian {{education}} {{sector was}} one of the sectors most severely affected by the 2010 earthquake, suffering great losses in terms of both infrastructure and manpower (GTEF 2011). According to the Ministry of National Education and Professional Training (MENFP), 4268 education infrastructure (schools, training centers, and institutions of higher education) were destroyed or structurally affected and most all services were suspended until April of 2010. The Economic and <b>Social</b> <b>Assistance</b> <b>Fund</b> of Haiti (FAES) was in charge of light infrastructure implementation to facilitate the return to school. As we mentioned above for international assistance, in the absence of recent data, the education programs’ focus (e.g., UNICEF’s emergency assistance for education services, Ti Manman Cheri, a conditional transfers program for school retention) was mainly geographical {{and most of the time}} favored the Metropolitan area (Lamaute-Brisson 2013). Beyond the response to the emergency situation, the principle of universal access to primary education was reiterated in the operational plan for founding the Haitian education system (2010 – 2015). 10 This recommendation finds its translation in the Programme of Free and Compulsory Universal Schooling (PSUGO)—also called Lekòl Timoun yo—released in 2011. PSUGO aims to increase and sustain demand for education with immediate effects, while the change in quality is slower. During the first year, the achievement was mainly in two departments, West (including the Metropolitan area) and Artibonite. According to MENFP, between 2010 and 2013, 288 schools were built (or rebuilt), 108 in the West department. The formation and recruitment of well-qualified teachers is still a challenge in itself despite the efforts that have been initiated (4123 teachers were recruited in 2012 – 2013; the target is 8000 at the end of the PSUGO program).|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{funding of}} social {{protection}} has strongly evolved in Bismarckian countries: whereas social protection used {{to rely on}} social contributions, since the 1990 s {{most of the new}} expenditures have been funded through taxation, leading to a more balanced mix in the structure of social protection revenue. I propose a formal model in which two social protection systems may coexist: insurance funded through <b>social</b> contributions and <b>assistance</b> <b>funded</b> through taxation. Insurance level is set by consensus between firms and unions, whereas assistance expenditures are set by a majority vote in parliament. Social insurance can be manipulated to influence preferences in respect of assistance. It is shown how an exogenous increase in tax competition in a Bismarckian context can lead to the emergence of a mixed model: assistance increases to complement existing insurance, not to replace it. A time series cross-section analysis on 9 countries over 25 years supports the idea that a drop in corporate tax rates can trigger a shift in the tax structure of social protection funding.

40|$|There is {{considerable}} concern about long-term recipiency of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> in many western countries today. <b>Social</b> <b>assistance</b> {{is intended to}} be a temporary solution for unforeseen individual problems, but there are worries that long-term recipiency of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> may lead to dependency. In this article, the duration of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> periods are investigated using Norwegian administrative data covering the years 1992 – 2002. Two types of analysis were performed. First, discrete time–event history analysis was used to investigate the duration of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> and the likelihood of re-entries among those who succeed in exiting <b>social</b> <b>assistance.</b> Second, panel data methods were used to study {{the amount of money that}} individuals receive in <b>social</b> <b>assistance.</b> The results show that most periods of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> are relatively short. However, there is variation, including some long-term periods, and a large proportion of those who exit <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> later re-enter.

There is no difference between immigrants and people born in Norway with regard to the likelihood of re-entering. The study also shows that there are many who receive universal benefits in addition to <b>social</b> <b>assistance.</b> Based on such findings, we question the common understanding of the <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> system as a secondary system and safety net for those who fall outside the traditional universal benefit system, and argue that more attention should be paid to the importance of institutional factors than to discourse on dependency...|$|R
