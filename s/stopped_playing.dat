5|$|The Crusaders' main home {{ground was}} the 36,000-capacity AMI Stadium in Christchurch. However, they <b>stopped</b> <b>playing</b> {{there during the}} 2011 Super Rugby season due to damage inflicted by the February Christchurch earthquake. The Crusaders usually took one game each year {{to another part of}} the {{franchise}} area, most often when the New Zealand cricket team was playing at AMI Stadium. Previous venues included Trafalgar Park in Nelson, and Alpine Energy Stadium in Timaru.|$|E
5|$|After joining Stade Montois, Serevi {{moved to}} the {{coaching}} staff due to the second level sides only being allowed to play two non-European Union players. After getting clearance from the French Rugby Federation, Serevi was cleared {{to play for the}} club in 2001. He continued there until joining Stade Bordelais in January 2004. In late 2004 Serevi joined London club Staines; making his debut in a victory against Thurrock in December that year. Serevi <b>stopped</b> <b>playing</b> professional club rugby in 2005.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1904 season, {{after passing}} his final medical examinations, Verge left Sydney University and <b>stopped</b> <b>playing</b> rugby for the team. A. J. McKenzie, whom he had {{displaced}} in 1902, took over at fullback, although he soon gave way to Verge's brother, Cuthbert. The older Verge was granted a blue, and was elected a vice-president of the club. However, he returned to the team for the tour of New Zealand in September 1906. Both Verge and his brother were selected for the tour squad.|$|E
5|$|Pearl Jam's 2000 European tour {{ended in}} tragedy on June 30, with an {{accident}} at the Roskilde Festival in Denmark. Nine fans were crushed underfoot and suffocated to death {{as the crowd}} rushed to the front. After numerous requests for the crowd to step back, the band <b>stopped</b> <b>playing</b> and tried to calm the crowd when the musicians realized what was happening, but {{it was already too}} late. The two remaining dates of the tour were canceled and members of the band contemplated retiring after this event. Pearl Jam was initially blamed for the accident, but was later cleared of responsibility.|$|E
5|$|Chrisye <b>stopped</b> <b>playing</b> {{altogether}} {{until the}} Nasutions {{invited him to}} rejoin Gipsy for their new project with Guruh, who offered Chrisye several songs {{in which he would}} be lead singer, with lyrics written especially for him. Overcoming his depression, he joined the group as they practised at Guruh's house in Kebayoran Baru, South Jakarta. The band often rehearsed late into the night; the indie project mixed Western rock and Balinese gamelan and was produced collaboratively. Recording took place in mid-1975, with only four songs completed in the first several months. It was released to critical acclaim in 1976, with a production of 5000copies. The success of Guruh Gipsy convinced Chrisye that he could sing as a soloist.|$|E

5|$|He then {{falls asleep}} {{continuing}} {{to play the}} note. A dream sequence of the opening scene of the film Chariots of Fire shows the characters running across a beach, though Mr. Bean dreams he is running with them. He begins to fall behind, until he hails a car to overtake all the others. Now running in front, Bean ensures he wins the race on the beach by tripping one of the runners trying to overtake him, whereupon he crosses the line with elation, and then wakes up. Finding {{that the rest of}} the orchestra have <b>stopped</b> <b>playing</b> while he continued his one recurring note, Bean, with encouragement from Rattle, plays an extended flourish and lastly touches a note that makes a flatulent sound, then stops.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 Byard was {{the subject}} of a short {{documentary}} film, Anything for Jazz, which featured him playing, teaching and with his family. By the 1980s his main instrument remained the piano, and he still played both alto and tenor saxophones, but he had <b>stopped</b> <b>playing</b> the other instruments that he used to use professionally – bass, drums, guitar, trombone, and trumpet, although he still taught all of them. In the same period, he was often heard in New York playing solo, in duos, or in trios. In 1988 he played with a band founded by Mingus' widow to perform the bassist's compositions – the Mingus Big Band. Byard played and recorded with a former student of his, Ricky Ford, from 1989 to 1991, and continued to play and teach during the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, a new {{band called}} Inveigh Catharsis formed in Des Moines, with Gray on bass, Brainard on guitar and Colsefni on drums. Jordison jammed {{occasionally}} with this group. Brainard eventually left to join Jordison and Jones in Modifidious, participating in demo recordings {{at the end}} of '93 and early in '94. During 1994 Modifidious sometimes played the same shows as Crahan's Heads on the Wall band. Gray formed a death metal band called Body Pit, soon becoming popular in the local scene. Modifidious <b>stopped</b> <b>playing</b> in the wake of death metal's increasing pull. Gray failed to get Jordison to join Body Pit, but soon after he recruited local guitar teacher Mick Thomson, the band broke up.|$|E

5|$|McCabe ran for an {{administrative}} position with his local club Mosman after his retirement, but was defeated, so {{he never had}} an opportunity to serve with the NSWCA. After the end of his first-class career, McCabe became a keen recreational golfer, but <b>stopped</b> <b>playing</b> in the mid-1950s due to his foot problems and other health issues. In 195657, McCabe and O'Reilly were given a testimonial match by the New South Wales Cricket Association. The match was between Harvey's XI and Lindwall's XI and acted as a trial for the non-Test tour of New Zealand. The match raised 7,500 pounds, which was split between McCabe and O'Reilly, and would have bought two average-sized homes in Sydney at the time.|$|E
5|$|The Rolling Stones have assimilated various musical genres {{into their}} own {{collective}} sound. Throughout the band's career, their musical contributions have been marked by a continual reference and reliance on musical styles including blues, psychedelia, R, country, folk, reggae, dance, and world music, exemplified by Jones' collaboration with the Master Musicians of Jajouka, as well as traditional English styles that use stringed instrumentation like harps. Brian Jones experimented {{with the use of}} non-traditional instruments such as the sitar and slide guitar in their early days. The group started out covering early rock 'n' roll and blues songs, and have never <b>stopped</b> <b>playing</b> live or recording cover songs.|$|E
5|$|The remark {{originates}} from {{an interview}} conducted by journalist Maureen Cleave, who included the statement in a March 1966 {{article for the}} London Evening Standard, which drew no public reaction at the time. When Datebook, a US teen magazine, quoted Lennon's comments five months later in August, extensive protests {{broke out in the}} Southern United States. Some radio stations <b>stopped</b> <b>playing</b> Beatles songs, their records were publicly burned, press conferences were cancelled, and threats were made. The controversy coincided with the group's US tour in August 1966, and Lennon and Brian Epstein attempted to quell the dispute at a series of press conferences. Some tour events experienced disruption and intimidation, including a picketing by the Ku Klux Klan.|$|E

5|$|Following the family's move to England, Armstrong's father's {{eyesight}} failed further due to retinitis pigmentosa. By that time, {{there were}} ten {{children in the}} Armstrong family. After his younger sister, Louise, died from sudden infant death syndrome, his mother left the family to live with another woman. Armstrong subsequently {{spent much of his}} youth in various children's homes, and was a serial truant from school. His mother had taught him to shoplift as a child, and he was involved in petty crime throughout his youth in Manchester. At nine years old, he began training at Brian Hughes' Collyhurst and Moston Boys' Club. He also played football for a local North Manchester team until the club received so many fines for Armstrong's fighting on the pitch that they were unable to pay them. At this point, he <b>stopped</b> <b>playing</b> football to concentrate on his training in the ring. During his time in the children's home Armstrong met Alison, who has remained his companion (and later his wife) throughout his professional career; they were parents by the time Armstrong was 17.|$|E
5|$|Meander's Australian rules {{football}} club {{was formed in}} 1923, playing in the Chudleigh Association, and won the Association premiership in 1931. The club <b>stopped</b> <b>playing</b> during World War II. After the war they moved to the Central Association, and later the Deloraine Association. From 1966–76 {{they were part of}} the Esk Association before returning to Deloraine. The club closed in 1982 due to a lack of both players and support from locals. Some footballers from Meander were noted for their later success in the game. Carl Watson played in the Meander club, before moving to the Latrobe Seniors. He played for Richmond 1925–31 and Essendon for his final Victorian Football League season in 1932. Ron McGowan was at Meander School in the 1950s. He played in various clubs in Tasmania before starting with Footscray where he played 120 games from 1967. He later played with South Adelaide, and spent time as Footscray's selection committee's chairman.|$|E
