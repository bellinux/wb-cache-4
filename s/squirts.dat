5|$|Fish {{may have}} {{evolved from a}} {{creature}} similar to a coral-like sea squirt, whose larvae resemble primitive fish in important ways. The first ancestors of fish may have kept the larval form into adulthood (as some sea <b>squirts</b> do today), although perhaps the reverse is the case.|$|E
5|$|Many sponges shed Sponge spicules, {{forming a}} dense carpet several meters deep that keeps away {{echinoderms}} which would otherwise prey on the sponges. They also produce toxins that prevent other sessile organisms such as bryozoans or sea <b>squirts</b> from growing {{on or near}} them, making sponges very effective competitors for living space. One of many examples includes ageliferin.|$|E

5|$|The Springfield Elementary School Model United Nations club {{is going}} on a field trip. On the bus, Bart, Nelson, Ralph, and Milhouse play a game by racing fruit down the aisle. Milhouse rolls a {{grapefruit}} that gets stuck under the brakes. When Otto tries to press down on the pedal, it <b>squirts</b> juice into his eyes, causing him to lose control and drive the bus off a bridge.|$|E
5|$|A few {{vertebrate}} {{species such}} as the Texas horned lizard are able to shoot <b>squirts</b> of blood from their eyes, by rapidly increasing the blood pressure within the eye sockets, if threatened. Because an individual may lose up to 53% of blood in a single squirt, this is only used against persistent predators like foxes, wolves and coyotes (Canidae), as a last defence. Canids often drop horned lizards after being squirted, and attempt to wipe or shake the blood out of their mouths, suggesting that the fluid has a foul taste; they choose other lizards if given the choice, suggesting a learned aversion towards horned lizards as prey.|$|E
5|$|For example, in {{the common}} {{cuttlefish}} the display consists of flattening the body, making the skin pale, showing a pair of eyespots on the mantle, dark eye rings, and a dark line on the fins, and dilating the pupils of the eyes. The common octopus similarly displays pale skin and dark eye rings with dilated pupils, but also curls its arms and stretches out the web between the arms as far as possible, and <b>squirts</b> out jets of water. Other octopuses such as Atlantic white-spotted octopus turn bright brownish red with oval white spots all over in a high contrast display. The paper nautilus can rapidly change its appearance: it suddenly withdraws the shining iridescent web formed by its first pair of arms from its shell.|$|E

5|$|In the {{original}} Nike-X plans, Sprint {{was the primary}} weapon and thus {{was considered to be}} an extremely high-priority development. To speed development, a sub-scale version of Sprint known as Squirt was tested from Launch Complex 37 at White Sands, the former Nike Ajax/Hercules test area. A total of five <b>Squirts</b> were fired between 6 November 1964 and 1965. The first Sprint Propulsion Test Vehicle (PTV) was launched from another area at the same complex on 17 November 1965, only 25 months after the final design was signed off. Sprint testing pre-dated construction of an MSR, and the missiles were initially guided by Zeus TTR and MTR radars. Testing continued under Safeguard, with a total of 42 test flights at White Sands and another 34 at Kwajalein.|$|E
5|$|SpongeBob SquarePants 4-D {{film and}} ride opened in various locations, {{including}} Six Flags Over Texas, Flamingo Land Resort, and the Shedd Aquarium. The ride features water <b>squirts,</b> real bubbles, and other sensory enhancements. In 2012, Nickelodeon teamed up again with SimEx-Iwerks Entertainment and Super 78 to produce SpongeBob SquarePants 4-D: The Great Jelly Rescue. The attraction opened in early 2013 at the Mystic Aquarium & Institute for Exploration. The attraction was also released at the Nickelodeon Suites Resort Orlando in Orlando, Florida. The seven-minute film follows SpongeBob, Patrick and Sandy {{to their old}} hijinks while rescuing the jellyfish of Jellyfish Fields from Plankton's evil clutches.|$|E
5|$|Mainly nocturnal, {{the female}} redback {{lives in an}} untidy web in a warm {{sheltered}} location, commonly near or inside human residences. It preys on insects, spiders and small vertebrates that become ensnared in its web. It kills its prey by injecting a complex venom through its two fangs when it bites, before wrapping them in silk and sucking out the liquefied insides. Often, It first <b>squirts</b> its victim with what resembles 'superglue' from its spinnerets, immobilising the prey by sticking the victim's limbs and appendages to its own body. The Redback Spider then trusses the victim with silk. Once its prey is restrained, it is bitten repeatedly on the head, body and leg segments and is then hauled back to the Redback Spider's retreat. Sometimes a potentially dangerous victim can be left to struggle for hours until it is exhausted enough to approach safely. Male spiders and spiderlings often live {{on the periphery of}} the female spiders' web and steal leftovers. Other species of spider and parasitoid wasps prey on this species. The redback is one of few arachnids that usually display sexual cannibalism while mating.|$|E

5|$|Under {{pressure}} from his {{director and the}} exhibit's drug manufacturer sponsor, Burton steals Zero's medical records in hopes of discovering new information. Zero and Burton examine an old blood sample of Zero's under a microscope and discover Miss HIV (Michael Callen), who {{points out that the}} original study that was used to label Patient Zero as the first person to bring HIV to North America did not prove any such thing, but instead helped prove that HIV was sexually transmitted, leading to the development of safer sex practices. Under this interpretation, Zero could be lauded as a hero for his candor in participating in that original study. As Burton ponders this, an unknown fluid <b>squirts</b> from the eye pieces of the microscope, drenching Zero and making him appear on video. He joyously declares his innocence on tape but the effect only lasts five minutes before he fades away again. Zero angrily accuses Burton of not caring for him at all and only wanting to use him for the exhibit, then storms out.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the wild}} stock, about 79 million metric tons (87 million tons) of food and non-food {{products}} were produced by sea farming in 2010, an all-time high. About six hundred species {{of plants and animals}} were cultured, some for use in seeding wild populations. The animals raised included finfish, aquatic reptiles, crustaceans, molluscs, sea cucumbers, sea urchins, sea <b>squirts,</b> and jellyfish. Integrated mariculture has the advantage that there is a readily-available supply of planktonic food and waste is removed naturally; in cases where the waste would otherwise be harmful, multi-species techniques can used to, e.g., feed farmed shellfish from the waste being produced by farmed salmon. Various methods are employed. Mesh enclosures for finfish can be suspended in the open seas, cages can be used in more sheltered waters, or ponds can be refreshed with water at each high tide. Shrimps can be reared in shallow ponds connected to the open sea. Ropes can be hung in water to grow algae, oysters, and mussels. Oysters can be reared on trays or in mesh tubes. Sea cucumbers can be ranched on the seabed. Captive breeding programmes have raised lobster larvae for release of juveniles into the wild resulting in an increased lobster harvest in Maine. At least 145 species of seaweed—red, green, and brown algae—are eaten worldwide, some long farmed in Japan and other Asian countries; there is great potential for additional algaculture. Few maritime flowering plants are widely used for food but one example is marsh samphire, which is eaten both raw and cooked. A major difficulty for aquaculture is the tendency towards monoculture and the associated risk of widespread disease. In the 1990s, disease wiped out China's farmed Farrer's scallop and white shrimp and required their replacement by other species. Shrimp farming has also caused the destruction of important mangrove forests throughout southeast Asia.|$|E
25|$|The PEDF gene {{is present}} in {{vertebrates}} from human to fish, but not present in sea <b>squirts,</b> worms, or fruit flies. Sea <b>squirts</b> express several serpin genes, suggesting that the PEDF gene may have arisen from another serpin family member after the evolution of vertebral animals. The gene most homologous to PEDF is its adjacent neighbor on chromosome 17, SerpinF2.|$|E

25|$|Vanabins: Also {{known as}} {{vanadium}} chromagens, {{they are found}} in the blood of sea <b>squirts.</b> They were once hypothesized to use the rare metal vanadium as an oxygen binding prosthetic group. However, although they do contain vanadium by preference, they apparently bind little oxygen, and thus have some other function, which has not been elucidated (sea <b>squirts</b> also contain some hemoglobin). They may act as toxins.|$|E

25|$|Early phylogenetic {{analyses}} {{demonstrated that}} the sequence of pre-mir-155 and miR-155-5p was conserved between human, mouse, and chicken. Recent annotated sequencing data found that 22 different organisms including, mammals, amphibians, birds, reptiles, sea <b>squirts,</b> and sea lampreys, express a conserved miR-155-5p.

5000|$|<b>Squirt</b> boating {{incorporates}} {{the use of}} low-volume boats to perform special moves in whitewater features. <b>Squirt</b> boating predates, and was critical to the foundation of, playboating. <b>Squirt</b> boats are often fairly long and flat, with low volume throughout the design. Because <b>squirt</b> boats are custom built to the paddlers weight, inseam, and personal preference, they are constructed with composite materials instead of plastic. Many <b>squirt</b> moves are intended to submerge {{all or part of}} the craft and paddler, such as the [...] "mystery move," [...] in which both the boat and the paddler submerge completely into the river's flow for several seconds and up to half a minute.|$|R
