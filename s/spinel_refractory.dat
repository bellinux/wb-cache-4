40|$|This Project {{is about}} {{designing}} the Development of magnesia-spinel brick using pre-synthesized and in-situ spinel. The spinel’s are {{a class of}} minerals of general formulation A 2 +B 3 + 2 O 2 - 4 which crystallize in the face centered cubic (isometric) crystal system, with the oxide anions arranged in a cubic close-packed lattice. The cation A fills the tetrahedral sites and cation B fills the octahedral sites. A and B are divalent and trivalent cations respectively. Pre-synthesized <b>spinel</b> <b>refractory</b> is the refractory where the spinel material is synthesized separately and is then added into the brick composition. Where as in-situ <b>spinel</b> <b>refractory</b> is the refractory where the spinel forms inside the brick during the firing stages at higher temperatures. The brick compositions of pre synthesized spinel and in-situ spinel were taken and pressed to form bricks. The bricks upon sintering at 1550 C and 1600 C led to increase in density. The in-situ spinel brick {{was found to have}} higher BD, lower porosity and higher shrinkage as compared to the pre synthesized <b>spinel</b> <b>refractory</b> brick...|$|E

Inclusions including oxide films and particles, <b>spinel,</b> <b>refractory</b> particles and silica particles have a detrimental effect on many aluminium cast products. The ability to reliably detect inclusions in a timely fashion is an essential part of this process. There are a number of tools available for inclusion measurement based on different chemical, physical and electrical principles.

Two of these particles contain hibonite, perovskite, <b>spinel,</b> <b>refractory</b> glass, and a melilite; only hibonite was identified within a third. The grain size for all particles ranges from 0. 05 to 1 micrometer, so that they are much finer grained than the refractory calcium- and aluminum-rich inclusions in meteorites.

Sintered products were characterized in terms of phase analysis, densities, thermal shock, monitoring the damaged surface area in the refractory specimen during thermal shock and ultrasonic determination of the Dynamic Young modulus of elasticity.

40|$|Based on {{research}} on cermet inert anodes for aluminium production, {{it has been}} suggested that nickel ferrite spinel might be suitable for use as a sidewall refractory in Hall-Héroult cells. A corrosion resistant sidewall would allow elimination of the frozen bath ledge, and has potentially huge benefits in terms of energy savings and increased productivity. However, little work has been done to assess nickel ferrite 2 ̆ 7 s suitability as a refractory. Dense nickel ferrite samples were prepared and characterized, and corrosion tests in cryolite based baths were conducted. Results confirm that the spinel does have good corrosion resistance. The corrosion mechanism is complex, involving grain boundary attack and formation of a Ni - Fe alloy. This alloy could pose a risk in terms of contamination of the aluminium.

40|$|Abstract. Researching and {{developing}} chrome-free refractory becomes a research hotspot at present because hexavalent chromium ions (Cr 6 +) {{may lead to}} environmental hazard.

It indicates that La 2 O 3 is a suitable additive to MgO-MgAl 2 O 4 -ZrO 2 brick which not only could stabilize phase transition of dicalcium silicate (C 2 S) in cement, but also do not impair the high-temperature-properties of spinel.

40|$|Sustainable use {{of natural}} {{resources}} {{in the production of}} construction materials has become a necessity both in Europe and Turkey. Construction products in Europe should have European Conformity (CE) and Environmental Product Declaration (EPD), an independently verified and registered document in line with the European standard EN 15804. An EPD certificate can be created by performing a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study. In this particular work, an LCA study was carried out for a refractory brick production for environmental assessment. In addition to the LCA, the Life Cycle Cost (LCC) analysis was also applied for economic assessment. Firstly, a cradle-to-gate LCA was performed for one ton of magnesia <b>spinel</b> <b>refractory</b> brick. The CML IA method included in the licensed SimaPro 8. 0. 1 software was chosen to calculate impact categories (namely, abiotic depletion, global warming potential, acidification potential, eutrophication potential, human toxicity, ecotoxicity, ozone depletion potential, and photochemical oxidation potential). The LCC analysis was performed by developing a cost model for internal and external cost categories within the software. The results were supported by a sensitivity analysis.

40|$|The {{laboratory}} {{immersion test}} system built and operated at ORNL {{was found to}} successfully screen samples from numerous refractory suppliers, including both commercially available and experimental materials. This system was found to provide an accurate prediction of how these materials would perform in the actual gasifier environment. Test materials included mullites, alumino-silicate bricks, fusion-cast aluminas, alumina-based and chrome-containing mortars, phosphate-bonded mortars, coated samples provided under an MPLUS-funded project, bonded spinels, different fusion-cast magnesia-alumina spinels with magnesia content ranging from 2. 5 % to about 60 %, high-MgO castable and brick materials, spinel castables, and alkali-aluminate materials. This testing identified several candidate material systems that perform well in the New Bern gasifier. Fusion-cast aluminas were found to survive for nearly one year, and magnesia-alumina spinels have operated successfully for 18 months {{and are expected to}} survive for two years. Alkali-aluminates and high-MgO-content materials have also been identified for backup lining applications. No other material with a similar structure and chemical composition to that of the fusion-cast magnesium-aluminum spinel brick currently being used for the hot-face lining is commercially available. Other materials used for this application have been found to have inferior service lives, as previously discussed. Further, over 100 laboratory immersion tests have been performed on other materials (both commercial and experimental), but none to date has performed as well as the material currently being used for the hot-face lining. Operating experience accumulated with the high-temperature gasifier at New Bern, North Carolina, has confirmed that the molten alkali salts degrade many types of refractories. Fusion-cast alumina materials were shown to provide a great improvement in lifetime over materials used previously. Further improvement was realized with fusion-cast magnesia-alumina <b>spinel</b> <b>refractory,</b> which appears to be the most resistant to degradation found to date, exhibiting over a year of service life and expected to be capable of over two years of service life. Regarding the use of refractory mortar, it was found that expansion of the current chrome-alumina mortar when subjected to black liquor smelt is likely contributing to the strains seen on the vessel shell. Additionally, the candidate high-alumina mortar that was originally proposed as a replacement for the current chrome-alumina mortar also showed a large amount of expansion when subjected to molten smelt. A UMR experimental mortar, composed of a phosphate bonded system specifically designed for use with fusion-cast magnesium-aluminum spinel, was found to perform well in the molten smelt environment. Strain gauges installed on the gasifier vessel shell provided valuable information about the expansion of the refractory, and a new set of strain gauges and thermocouples has been installed in order to monitor the loading caused by the currently installed <b>spinel</b> <b>refractory.</b> These results provide information for a direct comparison of the expansion of the two refractories. Measurements to date suggest that the fusion-cast magnesia-alumina spinel is expanding less than the fusion-cast {alpha}/{beta}-alumina used previously. A modified liquor nozzle was designed and constructed to test a number of materials that should be more resistant to erosion and corrosion than the material currently used. Inserts made of three erosion-resistant metallic materials were fabricated, along with inserts made of three ceramic materials. The assembled system was sent to the New Bern mill for installation in the gasifer in 2005. Following operation of the gasifier using the modified nozzle, inserts should be removed and analyzed for wear by erosion/corrosion. Although no materials have been directly identified for sensor/thermocouple protection tubes, several of the refractory material systems identified for lining material applications may be applicable for use in this capacity. Results of the modeling studies suggest that the temperature distribution is higher {{at the bottom of the}} gasifier than previously thought. Therefore, it may be possible to reduce the refractory temperature in the gasifier by changing the liquor spray. Also, modeling showed that because of the strong swirl, a separation zone could be formed at the corner of the conical wall where it meets the vertical barrel wall, and some the liquor droplets could be suspended in this zone. The accumulation of droplets in this area could cause instabilities in the performance and also in corrosion of the refractory...|$|E
40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{work has been done}} on {{evaluation}} of nickel ferrite as a material for fabrication of inert anodes, usually as a component in a metal-ceramic composite. Its relatively good resistance to corrosion by cryolite rich baths has led to the suggestion that it might be feasible to use nickel ferrite as a sidewall material. This is a very attractive option, as elimination of the frozen ledge has significant benefits in terms of energy savings and increased productivity. However, very little work has been done to assess its suitability as a refractory material Benchmark testing of the properties of nickel ferrite as a refractory have been conducted as part of a project funded by the CSIRO Flagship Cluster “Breakthrough Technology for Primary Aluminium”.

40|$|International audienceThe {{mechanical}} properties of refractory castables {{at room temperature}} are critical parameters for selecting suitable operating conditions for the structural design of refractory components. In this work, high alumina refractory castables based on the alumina-rich zone of the Al 2 O 3 -MgO-CaO ternary phase equilibrium diagram were prepared by adding synthetic spinel, periclase and dolomite via three processing routes. Bending strength studies at room temperature under several thermal treatments and {{the analysis of the}} elastic modulus of the refractories and their matrices point to two different mechanical behaviours. From room temperature to 1000 °C the refractory castables present a pronounced non-linear stress-strain behaviour both in the uniaxial tensile and compressive modes, as a result of damage to the microcrack network. Above 1000 °C the refractory castables begin to sinter owing to a transitory liquid phase, the crystallization of calcium aluminate cement phases (such as CA 2 and CA 6, for example) and the self-forming <b>spinel</b> phase (<b>refractory</b> castables with periclase or dolomite additions).

40|$|The present thesis {{focuses on}} the {{interaction}} between refractory and liquid steel. The aim of this work is to understand the interaction behavior between refractory and liquid steel regarding steel cleanliness. The effect of different refractories on different inclusions in Al-killed steel was studied in a furnace. The sintering mechanism of filler sand were also investigated in laboratory. In the industrial trials, the attachments of different oxides {{on the walls of}} submerged entry nozzle (SEN) were discussed in the cases of high strength low alloy steel (HSLA) and ultra-low carbon steel (ULC). It is found that the effect of alumina and <b>spinel</b> <b>refractory</b> on all the three types of inclusions is very little, while MgO refractory influences the inclusions depending on the activity of dissolved oxygen in liquid steel. At low oxygen level, alumina inclusions could transform into spinel inclusions with the help of MgO refractory, while the effect on spinel and calcium aluminate inclusions is not evident. On the other hand, when the activity of dissolved oxygen is high enough, the evolution of spinel inclusions from alumina inclusions could not be seen. The reaction between chromite and silica grains leading to liquid formation is the main mechanism for the sintering of filler sand. The factors viz. steel composition, silica size and content, operation temperature and process holding time have a strong influence on the sintering of the filler sand. Smaller size and higher content of silica in sand, steel grades containing higher Mn and Al contents, higher temperature and longer holding time would result in serious sintering. The choice of the sand needs to take those factors into account. The results show that solid alumina particles are always agglomerated on the inner wall of SEN in the case of ULC steel. The top slag with high FeO and MnO contents is considered as the main reason of this kind of attachments. The removal of slag might be a good method to avoid the attachments. In the case of HSLA steel, liquid calcium aluminate inclusions could attach on the inner wall of SEN as well. The smoothness of the inner wall of the SEN holds the key of liquid attachments. In addition, the attachment situation on the outer wall of SEN depends on the operations. The oxygen entrainment through the mold powder would result in the formation of plate-like alumina attachments. The control of reoxidation due to oxygen entrainment would help to avoid this situation. QC 20160816 </p...|$|E

The oxidation resistance was judged by weight change, metal thickness loss, depletion-zone formation, and oxide formation and morphology. The alloys which formed mostly nickel aluminate (NiAl 2 O 4) and aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3) (B- 1900, VIA, {{and to a}} lesser extent 713 C) were more oxidation resistant.

40|$|International audienceWe report {{concentrations}} of hydrogen (H) in upper mantle minerals of peridotites (olivine and pyroxenes) transported by alnöitic lavas, which erupted on the southwestern {{border of the}} Ontong Java Plateau (Malaita, Solomon Islands, West Pacific). Unpolarized FTIR analyses show that olivine, orthopyroxene, and diopside contain 2 – 32 ppm, 162 – 362 ppm and 159 – 459 ppm wt H 2 O, respectively. In the studied lherzolites, garnets are anhydrous. The concentration of hydrogen within individual olivine and pyroxene grains is almost homogeneous, indicating no evidence of dehydration or hydration by ionic diffusion. In the lherzolite, the concentration of hydrogen in olivine tends to increase weakly with depth (based on geothermobarometry), consistent {{with the increase of}} water solubility with increasing water fugacity as a function of pressure, but concentrations remain well below water-saturation values determined experimentally. The highest concentration of H in olivine (32 ppm wt H 2 O) is, however, found in <b>refractory</b> <b>spinel</b> harzburgites, which equilibrated at depths of 85 km., while deeper specimens as the high-temperature spinel harzburgites, and some of the garnet lherzolites, contain less hydrogen in olivine. Olivines from pyroxene- or pargasite-rich peridotites have also lower hydrogen concentrations. We interpret the high hydrogen concentrations in olivine from the <b>refractory</b> <b>spinel</b> harzburgites as due to (1) simultaneous hydration and metasomatism of the lithospheric mantle by a water-rich silicate melt/fluid, during which hydrogen follows MREE and where spinel harzburgite have experienced ‘stealth’ metasomatism, and/or (2) to a late ‘fleeting’ hydrogen metasomatism, which would hydrate the rock after this first ‘stealth’ metasomatism event. In the second case, the composition of the ‘fleeting’ percolating fluid (small volume fraction of very evolved fluids, with high volatiles concentration and transient properties) is likely to be linked to the decrease of the plume activity and resulting in the downwelling of the lithosphere asthenosphere boundary. The difference in hydrogen concentration between harzburgites and lherzolites could be linked to variation in trace elements in olivine induced by the first ‘stealth’ metasomatism alone or associated to the late ‘fleeting’ hydrogen metasomatism, triggered by the lack of secondary crystallization of clinopyroxenes in the harzburgite. To conclude, H concentrations in upper mantle minerals may thus be correlated to metasomatic events, with the later yielding variation of the mineral assemblage and trace element composition that constitute the peridotites...|$|R
40|$|In present thesis, the {{fundamental}} {{studies on the}} reaction between MgO based refractories and slag were undertaken {{for the development of}} a carbon-free bonding MgO lining material. Alumina was selected as a potential binder material. Due to MgO-Al 2 O 3 chemical reaction, the developed refractory was bonded by MgO·Al 2 O 3 spinel phase. To begin with, an investigation of the dissolution process of dense MgO and MgO·Al 2 O 3 spinel in liquid slag was carried out. To obtain reliable information for dissolution study, a new experimental method was therefore developed. In this method, a cylinder was rotating centrally in a special designed container with a quatrefoil profile. This method also showed a good reliability in revealing the dissolution mechanism by quenching the whole reaction system. The experimental results showed that the dissolution process of MgO and spinel was controlled by both mass transfer and chemical reaction. It was found that the rapid dissolution of spinel was mainly because of its larger driving force. To improve the resistance against slag penetration, two aspects were studied to develop carbon-free MgO refractory. First, colloidal alumina was used and the effect of its addition into MgO matrix was investigated. The use of colloidal alumina was to form bonding products in the grain boundary of MgO. The results showed that the alumina addition greatly improved the resistance of MgO based refractory against slag penetration in comparison with the decarburized MgO-carbon refractory. It was found that the improvement of resistance was mainly related to the spinel-slag reaction products of CaO·Al 2 O 3 and CaO·MgO·Al 2 O 3 solid phases at the grain boundaries. Second, the effect of particle size distribution on the penetration resistance of MgO was investigated. The most profound improvement against the slag penetration was obtained by using a proper particle size distribution. The results highlighted the importance of considering the refractory structure. Experiments were undertaken to investigate the dissolution mechanism of different types of MgO based refractories in liquid slag. It was observed that the dissolution of <b>spinel</b> bonded MgO <b>refractory</b> was much slower than the decarburized MgO-carbon refractory. The primary dissolution in <b>spinel</b> bonded MgO <b>refractory</b> occurred at the slag-penetrated layer, and the removal of this layer by peeling off enhanced the dissolution rate rapidly.

Harzburgite is the {{predominant}} rock {{type in the}} recovered samples, with subordinate dunite; no lherzolite was found. The harzburgite is diopside-free to sparsely diopside-bearing, with modal percentages of diopside that range from 0 % to 2 %. Spinels in the harzburgites are chrome-rich (Cr/[Cr + Al] = 0. 38 - 0. 83; Fe 3 +/[Fe 3 + + Cr + Al] = 0. 01 - 0. 07). Olivine and orthopyroxene are magnesian (Mg# = 0. 92).

The bulk major-element chemistry shows low average values of TiO 2 (trace), Al 2 O 3 (0. 55 %) and CaO (0. 60 %), but high Mg# (0. 90). These rocks are more depleted than the abyssal peridotites from the mid-oceanic ridge. They are interpreted as residues of extensive partial melting (= 30 %), of which the last episode was in the mantle wedge, probably associated with the generation of incipient island-arc magma, including boninite and/or arc-tholeiite.

40|$|The Neoarchean layered anorthositic {{complex at}} Sittampundi in {{southern}} India {{is known for}} its chromitite layers that are mostly associated with anorthosite (An(90 - 100)). The chromitites contain FeAl-rich chromites concentrated in layers between amphibole-rich layers with a dominant mineralogy of amphibole-spinel-plagiocase+/-sapphirine. The chromite-rich layers contain only amphibole and plagioclase. Mineral compositions illustrated by X-ray composition maps and profiles show subtle chemical differences. The chrome <b>spinels</b> are of <b>refractory</b> grade with Cr 2 O 3 and Al 2 O 3 contents varying between 34 - 40 wt. % and 23 - 28 wt. %. The chromite compositions are noticeably different from those in layered igneous intrusions of the Bushveld-Stillwater type. The existence of original highly calcic plagioclase, FeAl-rich chromite, and magmatic amphibole is consistent with derivation from a parental magma of hydrous tholeiitic composition that was most likely generated in a supra-subduction zone arc setting. In terms of mineralogy and field relations, the Sittampundi chromitites are remarkably similar to anorthosite-hosted chromitites in the Neoarchean Fiskensset anorthositic complex, Greenland. We propose that the Sittampundi chromitites formed by partial melting of unusually aluminous harzburgite in a hydrated mantle wedge above a subduction zone. This melting process produced hydrous, aluminous basalt, which fractionated at depth to give rise to a variety of high-alumina basalt compositions from which the anorthositic complex with its cumulate chromite-rich and amphibole-rich layers formed within the magma chamber of a supra-subduction zone arc.

Vein minerals in reaction zones with host harzburgites show progressive depletion in MREE-HREE at constant Zr-Hf and develop patterns (U-shaped REE with Zr-Hf spikes) that mimic those of LCB. Major and trace element modeling suggests that these veins (1) formed from a high-temperature (≥ 1400 °C), MgO-rich (∼ 30 wt. %) and silicic (∼ 54 wt. % SiO 2) initial melt, strongly depleted in Al 2 O 3, TiO 2 and alkalis and (2) record fractionation of the initial melt to form hydrous liquids; the initial melt was equilibrated with metasomatized Kamchatka harzburgites and was similar in trace element abundances to island arc tholeiite (LREE-depleted to flat LREE-MREE patterns, low Nb and Ta but no significant Zr-Hf anomalies, high LILE). We argue that primary magmas of LCB formed by fluid-fluxed (LILE-rich and [Nb, Ta]-depleted fluid) melting of a cpx-free, highly refractory (≥ 30 % melt extraction) harzburgitic source similar to arc peridotites from Kamchatka and elsewhere. This peculiar source may explain the distinctive major element features of LCB primary magmas.

M 1 is recorded by inclusions of high-Mg olivine, high-Mg-Al-Cr-Ca orthopyroxene and high-Mg clinopyroxene in the high Ca-Cr cores of the garnet porphyroclasts, suggesting that the Zhimafang peridotite was probably a garnet lherzolite originated from a deep and hot mantle wedge above the previously subducted oceanic slab. M 2 is represented by inclusions of high-Mg-Al chromite, high-Mg olivine and high-Mg orthopyroxene in the low-Cr mantles of the garnet porphyroclasts and core of the matrix garnet, suggesting that the rock was convected to shallow and hot mantle wedge, and was transformed to <b>refractory</b> <b>spinel</b> harzburgite or spinel dunite due to high degree of decompressional partial melting. M 3 is manifested by the origin of metasomatic clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene porphyroblasts with inclusions of high-Fe chromite, tremolitic or edenitic amphibole, phlogopite, barite and pyrite, indicating that the rock was convected to shallow, cold and wet corner of the mantle wedge, and was transformed to a fertile amphibole-bearing spinel lherzolite during continental subduction. The lherzolites was subsequently transformed to high-pressure (HP) amphibole-bearing garnet lherzolite (M 4) and UHP garnet lherzolite (M 5), indicating its convection to deep mantle wedge.

The lherzolites range from slightly depleted to moderately LREE-enriched with flat HREE patterns between 1. 5 and 2. 7 x chondrite (Ch). In contrast, the harzburgites are extremely depleted in HREE (down to 0. 2 x Ch) and strongly LREE-enriched (La-N/Yb-N = 12. 3 - 17. 2). LA-ICP-MS analyses of clinopyroxene and amphibole of the lherzolites highlight variable degrees of LREE depletion (HREE up to 13 x Ch, LaN/YbN down to 0. 01), {{with the exception}} of a single sample in which both clinopyroxene and amphibole are LREE-enriched (LaN/YbN UP to 19). In the harzburgites, clinopyroxenes display totally different REE distributions, characterized by extreme HREE depletion (down to 0. 4 x Ch) and upward convex positively fractionated middle-light REE patterns (Nd-N/Yb-N up to 20. 7 x Ch; La-N/Yb-N up to 12 x Ch). Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic data for both whole-rocks and cpx separates, coherently indicate depleted mantle (DM) compositions for the lherzolites (epsilon Sr=- 15 to - 26, epsilon Nd=+ 9 to + 17, epsilon Hf=+ 18 to + 68) and enriched mantle (EM) compositions for the harzburgites (epsilon Sr=- 10 to + 36, epsilon Nd=- 1 to - 6, -epsilon Hf=+ 3 to + 8). Modelling of the clinopyroxene PEE data and isotopic systematics suggest that some therzolites were affected by pre-Paleozoic (0. 6 - 1 By) low-degree partial melting processes, while others probably reflect some extent of refertilization of the mantle protolith by metasomatizing melts similar to the Triassic rift-related tholeiites reported from several Pyrenean localities. The harzburgites represent extreme refractory residua, resulting from a complex depletion history due to multistage melt extraction as often observed in the cratonic mantle. The distinctive REE patterns and isotopic systematics of their clinopyroxenes suggest that the harzburgites were formed by the interaction of an ultra-depleted peridotite matrix with highly alkaline basic melts similar in composition to the Permo-Triassic alkaline lamprophyres which are widespread within the Iberian plate. Lherzolites possibly represent younger lithosphere (accreted asthenosphere?) up-lifted and juxtaposed to the older subcontinental lithospheric mantle (harzburgites) during the post-Variscan rifting of the Iberian margin. These two genetically different, but adjoining, mantle domains intimately mingled along the northern Iberian margin during the subsequent plate convergence processes, leading to the close association of harzburgites and lherzolites observed in the Olot mantle xenoliths and in some Pyrenean peridotite massifs...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Ronda orogenic {{peridotite}} (southern Spain) {{contains a}} variety of pyroxene-rich rocks ranging from high-pressure garnet granulites and pyroxenites to low-pressure plagioclasespinel websterites. The 'asthenospherized' part of the Ronda peridotite contains abundant layered websterites ('group C' pyroxenites), without significant deformation, that occur as swarms of layers showing gradual modal transitions towards their host peridotites. Previous {{studies have suggested that}} these layered pyroxenites formed by the replacement of <b>refractory</b> <b>spinel</b> peridotites. Here, we present a major- and trace-element, and numerical modelling study of a layered outcrop of group C pyroxenite near the locality of Tolox aimed at constraining the origin of these pyroxenites after host peridotites by pervasive pyroxene-producing, refertilization meltrock reactions. Mg-number [=Mg/(Mg + Fe) cationic ratio] numerical modelling shows that decreasing Mg-number with increasing pyroxene proportion, characteristic of Ronda group C pyroxenites, can be accounted for by a melt-consuming reaction resulting in the formation of mildly evolved, relatively low Mg-number melts (similar to 0. 65) provided that the melt fraction during reaction and the time-integrated melt/rock ratio are high enough (> 0. 1 and > 1, respectively) to balance Mg-Fe buffering by peridotite minerals. This implies strong melt focusing caused by melt channelling in high-porosity domains resulting from compaction processes in a partial melted lithospheric domain below a solidus isotherm represented by the Ronda peridotite recrystallization front. The chondrite-normalized rare earth element (REE) patterns of group C whole-rocks and clinopyroxenes are convex-upward. Numerical modeling of REE variations in clinopyroxene produced by a pyroxene-forming, melt-consuming reaction results in curved trajectories in the (Ce/Nd) (N) vs (Sm/Yb) (N) diagram (where N indicates chondrite normalized). Based on (Ce/Nd) (N) values, two transient, enriched domains between the light REE (LREE) -depleted composition of the initial peridotite and that of the infiltrated melt may be distinguished in the reaction column: (1) a lower domain characterized by convex-upward REE patterns similar to those observed in Ronda group C pyroxeniteperidotite; (2) an upper domain characterized by melts with strongly LREE-enriched compositions. The latter are probably volatile-rich, small-volume melt fractions residual after the refertilization reactions that generated group C pyroxenites, which migrated throughout the massifincluding the unmelted lithospheric spinel-tectonite domain. The Ronda mantle domains affected by pyroxenite- and dunite- or harzburgite-forming reactions (the 'layered granular' subdomain and 'plagioclase-tectonite' domain) are on average more fertile than the residual, 'coarse granular' subdomain at the recrystallization front. This indicates that refertilization traces the moving boundaries of receding cooling of a thinned and partially melted subcontinental lithosphere. This refertilization process may be widespread during transient thinning and melting of depleted subcontinental lithospheric mantle above upwelling asthenospheric mantle...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe mantle above a subducting slab is {{the site}} of complex {{interactions}} between deformation, partial melting, fluid migration and magma transport. To constrain these interactions and their effects on olivine deformation, we analyze microstructures, crystal preferred orientations, and water contents of peridotite xenoliths entrained by andesites of the Avacha volcano, southern Kamchatka arc. These xenoliths are <b>refractory</b> <b>spinel</b> harzburgites that have coarse-grained microstructures with widely spaced subgrain boundaries and sinuous grain boundaries in olivine, consistent with deformation by dislocation creep under low deviatoric stress (< 13 MPa) and with a significant contribution from diffusional processes. Analysis of crystal preferred orientations (CPO) indicates dominant activation of high-temperature, low-stress { 0 kl}[100] slip systems in olivine and of(100) [001] in orthopyroxene. In most samples, coarse opx crystals, elongated parallel to the lineation, enclose small olivine grains in crystallographic continuity with neighbouring crystals, indicating crystallization of orthopyroxene at the expense of olivine as a result of reactive percolation of Si-rich fluids coeval with the high-temperature deformation. Secondary crystallization of interstitial orthopyroxene led locally to development of opx-rich lenses parallel to the foliation, characterized by a decrease in olivine grain size and dispersion of the olivine CPO without changing the dominant slip systems. Half of the samples also show acicular orthopyroxene aggregates with which is associated a fine-grained matrix composed of rounded strain-free olivine, orthopyroxene, spinel, and rare amphibole crystals. This matrix occurs pervasively along grain boundaries or forms millimeter-scale irregular lenses and anastomosing veinlets that crosscut the coarse crystals and their ductile deformation structures. Both acicular orthopyroxene and the fine-grained matrix are interpreted as resulting from reactive transport of H 2 O-rich fluids under static conditions, probably in the lithospheric mantle. Infrared analyses show that olivine contains 1 - 8 center dot 6 ppm by weight of water. These low water contents are similar to those observed in spinel peridotites from other subduction zones and probably record both the low solubility of water in olivine at low pressure and dehydration during exhumation of the xenoliths. Water contents in orthopyroxene are highly variable (25 - 506 ppm H 2 O), probably recording spatially heterogeneous interaction with fluids or melts and compositional disequilibrium in the studied samples. Change in the dominant percolation mechanism from porous flow to fracturing suggests cooling, consistent with the low temperatures estimated from pyroxene thermometry (< 800 - 900 degrees C). The Avacha xenoliths therefore record pervasive deformation of a region of the mantle under asthenospheric conditions, followed by its accretion {{to the base of the}} lithosphere, probably as a result of cooling of the mantle wedge. Percolation of Si-rich fluids or hydrous melts is recorded at all stages; this probably enhanced diffusion and lowered deviatoric stresses during ductile deformation, but did not change the dominant slip direction in olivine from [100] to [001]...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{formation}} {{age of the}} Siberian cratonic mantle is {{not well}} established as yet. Re–Os data on various mantle-derived materials have shown that it contains Archaean components, but the reported Re-depletion ages show a broad variation range (3. 4 to 1 Ga) and are commonly ≤ 2 Ga for peridotite xenoliths. We report Hf and Nd isotope data for cpx and garnet separated from nine <b>refractory</b> <b>spinel</b> and garnet peridotite xenoliths from the Udachnaya kimberlite. The cpx from low-opx spinel harzburgites show extremely high εHf values, from + 607 to + 2084, which testify to long-term evolution of these rocks with high Lu/Hf ratios, consistent with their residual origin and near absence of post-melting enrichments in the Lu–Hf system. Such high εHf values are unusual for cpx from other cratonic peridotites and are higher than those reported for depleted cpx in off-cratonic peridotites. The clinopyroxenes from low-opx spinel harzburgites yield Hf model ages from 1. 9 to 1. 7 Ga while the cpx from high-opx spinel harzburgites yield Hf model ages from 3. 0 to 1. 9 Ga. When plotted together, they define a Lu/Hf isochron with an age of 1. 80 Ga, which we consider as a robust estimate of the formation age (melt extraction event) because it is obtained on residual rocks that show no evidence for HREE and Hf enrichments and because the model ages for {{three out of four}} individual samples are similar to each other. The cpx have high εNd of + 94 to + 123, which are inconsistent with their low Sm/NdPM of < 1 and yield no meaningful age estimates. The consistently high, positive εNd in these cpxs can be interpreted in terms of long-term evolution of refractory peridotites with high Sm/Nd, followed by relatively recent LREE enrichments. We infer that {{a significant part of the}} lithospheric mantle in the central Siberian craton may have been formed during a major event (or a series of events) at around 1. 8 Ga. Older ages reported for the central Siberian craton may refer to less common materials from cratonic or other domains formed in the Archaean that were later incorporated into the cratonic roots. The transition from the “Archaean” to “modern” tectonic regimes in Siberia and possibly elsewhere may have taken place at 1. 8 – 1. 9 Ga rather than at ~ 2. 5 Ga, i. e. in the second half of the Paleoproterozoic rather than at the Archaean–Proterozoic boundary, at which time the asthenospheric mantle became generally too cold to experience high-degree melting on a large scale. The ~ 1. 8 Ga formation age of the Siberian cratonic mantle is coeval with that for a major part of the ancient continental crust in the central Siberian craton. The temporal crust–mantle links may be explained either by the generation of the initial source materials for continental crust in the same melting event that formed the residual peridotites or, alternatively, by subduction and melting of pre-existing proto-lithosphere destabilized by a major mantle upwelling that formed the residual mantle...|$|R
