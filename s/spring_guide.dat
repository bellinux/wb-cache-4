5|$|The MP 40 submachine {{guns are}} open-bolt, blowback-operated {{automatic}} arms. The only mode of fire was fully automatic, but {{the relatively low}} rate of fire enabled single shots with controlled trigger pulls. The bolt features a telescoping return <b>spring</b> <b>guide</b> {{which serves as a}} pneumatic recoil buffer. The cocking handle was permanently attached to the bolt on early MP 38s, but on late production MP 38s and MP 40s, the bolt handle was made as a separate part. It also served as a safety by pushing the head of handle into one of two separate notches above the main opening; this action locked the bolt either in the cocked (rear) or uncocked (forward) position. The absence of this feature on early MP 38s resulted in field expedients such as leather harnesses with a small loop, used to hold the bolt in forward position.|$|E
25|$|Increasingly, it {{has become}} popular to reduce handgun weight and cost as well as {{increase}} corrosion resistance by using polymers. Starting around the year 2000, Beretta began replacing some parts with polymer and polymer coated metal. Polymer parts include the recoil <b>spring</b> <b>guide</b> rod which is now also fluted, magazine floor plate, magazine follower and the mainspring cap/lanyard loop. Polymer coated metal parts include the left side safety lever, trigger, and magazine release button.|$|E

2500|$|The Glock 19 is {{effectively}} a reduced-size Glock 17, called the [...] "Compact" [...] by the manufacturer. It was first produced in 1988, primarily for military and law enforcement. The Glock 19's barrel and pistol grip are shorter by about [...] {{compared to the}} Glock 17 and uses a magazine with a standard capacity of 15 rounds. The pistol is compatible with factory magazines from the Glock 17 and Glock 18, giving the Glock 19 available capacities of: 17 rounds (standard magazine with +2 extension), 10, 17, and 19 (standard Glock 17 magazine with +2), and the 31 (standard Glock 18 magazine with +2 removed) and 33 rounds of the Glock 18. To preserve the operational reliability of the short recoil system, {{the mass of the}} slide remains the same as in the Glock 17 from which it is derived. With the exception of the slide, frame, barrel, locking block, recoil <b>spring,</b> <b>guide</b> rod, and slide lock spring, all of the other components are interchangeable between the models 17 and 19 iwb holster.|$|E

50|$|Several {{critical}} {{parts of}} early production M60s, {{such as the}} receiver cover and feed tray, were made from very thin sheet metal stampings and were prone to bending or breaking; sturdier parts were eventually available in the early 1970s. Early M60s also had driving <b>spring</b> <b>guides</b> and operating rods that were too thin and gas pistons that were too narrow behind the piston head (part {{of an attempt to}} save weight), leading to problems with breakage. Metallurgical problems also played a part, (blamed by some on low-bid contractors), but after 1970 a slightly heavier part was designed and slowly put into the supply chain. High-round-count weapons were also susceptible to stretching of the receiver and other parts.|$|R

5000|$|The Incabloc {{system uses}} a [...] "lyre-shaped" [...] spring {{to allow the}} {{delicate}} bearings to shift in their settings under impact, until a stronger shoulder of the staff contacts the strong metal endpiece, so that the pivots and bearings don't have to bear {{the force of the}} impact. When the impact is over, the <b>springs</b> <b>guide</b> the parts back to their original positions. The staff itself does not move relative to the jewel bearing, but the whole bearing is carried in a metal bushing that is free to move in the metal endpiece, {{under the control of the}} spring. Some modern balance wheels use a simpler arrangement, where, taking advantage of the low cost of modern synthetic rubies, a large jewel moves as its own mobile bushing.|$|R
50|$|The M25 {{is similar}} in many ways to the M21. It has a National Match M14 barrel in a McMillan glass bedded {{fiberglass}} stock, uses a special gas piston, a National Match <b>spring</b> <b>guide</b> and a Brookfield Precision Tool Advanced Scope Mounting System. Most rifles use the Bausch & Lomb 10× Tactical scope; some use scopes made by Leupold & Stevens, including the Ultra Mark 4 M1, Ultra Mark 4 M3, and Vari X-III LR M3. Suppressors for use with this rifle are manufactured by OPS.|$|E

50|$|Petter {{designed}} a pistol which {{had some of}} the same design elements as the John Browning M1911 such as the grooved slide and barrel which interlocked and recoiled together until a pivoting link lowered the barrel, thus unlocking the assembly and further rearward movement of the barrel and slide together, which after reaching the point of greatest movement would be returned back to battery. Along the way the slide would strip a cartridge from the magazine and push it into the chamber just prior to the under barrel link forcing the barrel up into engagement with the slide, locking the action. Petter eliminated the barrel bushing and used a full length <b>spring</b> <b>guide</b> which had the effect of removing one of the elements of inaccuracy from the M1911 design and increased functional reliability.|$|E
50|$|The submachine gun {{consists}} of the following main components: the barrel, frame (containing the shoulder stock, pistol grip and forward grip), slide, return spring and <b>spring</b> <b>guide</b> rod and the magazine. The slide houses an inertia buffer and spring retarder mechanism, designed to reduce the weapon's rate of fire down to 650 rounds/min from a natural frequency of about 840 rounds/min. The slide telescopes around the barrel up to the muzzle and has an extension {{that serves as a}} recoil compensator which deflects muzzle gases upward to counteract the natural rise of the weapon when firing in automatic mode. The compensator is shaped like a long spoon and can be used to cock the weapon with just one hand, accomplished by pressing the compensator up against a rigid vertical surface until the slide locks back.|$|E
