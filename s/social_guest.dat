40|$|In United States tort law, {{there are}} two general {{approaches}} to determining when a property owner is to {{be held liable for}} damages to entrants on his land. Twenty-four states follow common law tradition, which distinguishes between trespassers, invitees (business visitors), and licensees (social guests) (Cupp Jr. 2010, fn. 2). A “reasonable duty of care, ” often including a duty to warn of danger as well as a duty to inspect and make safe, is taken to obtain {{in the case of the}} latter two, but not always in the case of trespassers. 1 Call this the traditional approach. In 1968, the landmark California Supreme Court case Rowland v. Christian (1968) introduced a second approach. At issue in Rowland was a <b>social</b> <b>guest</b> who injured himself on a faucet. Miss Christian, the defendant, was aware of the dangerous condition of the faucet and failed to warn James Rowland, the plaintiff, of the danger. In finding for the plaintiff, the court established a precedent that regarded the three-fold distinction between trespasser, invitee, and licensee as non-dispositive, and suggested a singular approach that imposes a duty of reasonable care on land 1 There is a good deal of variation here. First, on some versions, a higher duty applies to invitees than to licensees. Second, different jurisdictions treat the legal duty itself differently. The Arizona Supreme Court, in Siddons v. Business Properties Development Co. (1998) cited the Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 360, concluding that...|$|E
