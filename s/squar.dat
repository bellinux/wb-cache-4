40|$|Different {{hazard rate}} nonparametric estimators for {{randomly}} right-censored data are considered in this paper. Lacking sufficiently homogeneous theoritical results {{allowing for a}} comparison between their performances, an empirical procedure is adopted. This procedure {{is based on an}} empirical estimation of the MISE criterion ("Mean Integrated <b>Squarred</b> Error") from simulated data. It highlights the fact that an estimator which is based on the nearest-neighbor method, and which we introduce, is more dependable thus more appropriate for unemployment data analysis. Application of this new nonparametric estimator allows us to validate results from a parametric model estimation, and particularly to show the information loss caused by inflexible parametric specification of the hazard rate. ...|$|R

Based on the equivalence of penalized splines and the Hodrick-Prescott filter, this paper connects the mixed model framework of penalized splines to the Wiener- Kolmogorov filter. In the case that trend and cycle are described by ARIMA-processes, this filter yields the mean <b>squarred</b> error minimizing estimations of both components. It is shown that for certain settings of the parameters, a penalized spline within the mixed model framework {{is equal to the}} Wiener-Kolmogorov filter for a second fold integrated random walk as the trend and a stationary ARMA-process as the cyclical component...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} physics {{arguments}} for a high-luminosity high energy polarized Electron- Nucleon/Nucleus-Collider (i. e. with a luminosity {{of at least}} 10 ^{ 33 } cm^{- 2 } sec^{- 1 } and an invariant energy <b>squarred</b> of at least s >= 100 GeV^ 2) are presented. The main purpose of this machine would be generally speaking the investigation of QCD beyond the twist- 2 level respectively of nuclear physics beyond the level of 'effective' models. Specific topics are: twist- 2 and twist- 3 spin-asymmetries as probes of both the internal hadron structure and the hadronization process, Off-Forward-Parton-Distributions as a new dimension of QCD-physics, nuclear effects for the nucleon structure and nuclear effects for QCD-dynamics in nuclei. The last two topics are also of direct relevance for high-energy heavy-ion-collisons. We conclude {{that the need for}} such a collider is clear, if nuclear physics is to continue its development towards a comprehensive understanding of QCD phenomena.

40|$|The {{so-called}} "symplectic method" is {{used for}} studying the linear stability of a self-gravitating collisionless stellar system, in which the particles are also submitted to an external potential. The system is steady and spherically symmetric, and its distribution function f_ 0 thus depends only on the energy E and the <b>squarred</b> angular momentum L^ 2 of a particle. Assuming that ∂ f_ 0 / ∂ E < 0, it is first shown that stability holds with respect to all the spherical perturbations [...] a statement {{which turns out to}} be also valid for a rotating spherical system. Thus it is proven that the energy of an arbitrary aspherical perturbation associated to a "preserving generator" δ g_ 1 [i. e., one satisfying ∂ f_ 0 / ∂ L^ 2 {δ g_ 1, L^ 2 } = 0] is always positive if ∂ f_ 0 / ∂ L^ 2 ≤ 0 and the external mass density is a decreasing function of the distance r to the center. This implies in particular (under the latter condition) the stability of an isotropic system with respect to all the perturbations. Some new remarks on the relation between the symmetry of the system and the form of f_ 0 are also reported. It is argued in particular that a system with a distribution function of the form f_ 0 = f_ 0 (E,L^ 2) is necessarily spherically symmetric.

6000|$|By {{the time}} he was a month old the {{necessity}} of giving him a name became apparent. He had generally been known as [...] "The Kid," [...] "Stumpy's Boy," [...] "The Coyote" [...] (an allusion to his vocal powers), and even by Kentuck's endearing diminutive of [...] "The damned little cuss." [...] But these were felt to be vague and unsatisfactory, and were at last dismissed under another influence. Gamblers and adventurers are generally superstitious, and Oakhurst one day declared that the baby had brought [...] "the luck" [...] to Roaring Camp. It was certain that of late they had been successful. [...] "Luck" [...] was the name agreed upon, with the prefix of Tommy for greater convenience. No allusion was made to the mother, and the father was unknown. [...] "It's better," [...] said the philosophical Oakhurst, [...] "to take a fresh deal all round. Call him Luck, and start him fair." [...] A day was accordingly set apart for the christening. What was meant by this ceremony the reader may imagine who has already gathered some idea of the reckless irreverence of Roaring Camp. The master of ceremonies was one [...] "Boston," [...] a noted wag, and the occasion seemed to promise the greatest facetiousness. This ingenious satirist had spent two days in preparing a burlesque of the Church service, with pointed local allusions. The choir was properly trained, and Sandy Tipton was to stand godfather. But after the procession had marched to the grove with music and banners, and the child had been deposited before a mock altar, Stumpy stepped before the expectant crowd. [...] "It ain't my style to spoil fun, boys," [...] said the little man, stoutly eyeing the faces around him, [...] "but it strikes me that this thing ain't exactly on the <b>squar.</b> It's playing it pretty low down on this yer baby to ring in fun on him that he ain't goin' to understand. And ef there's goin' to be any godfathers round, I'd like to see who's got any better rights than me." [...] A silence followed Stumpy's speech. To the credit of all humorists be it said that the first man to acknowledge its justice was the satirist thus stopped of his fun. [...] "But," [...] said Stumpy, quickly following up his advantage, [...] "we're here for a christening, and we'll have it. I proclaim you Thomas Luck, according to the laws of the United States and the State of California, so help me God." [...] It was the first time that the name of the Deity had been otherwise uttered than profanely in the camp. The form of christening was perhaps even more ludicrous than the satirist had conceived; but strangely enough, nobody saw it and nobody laughed. [...] "Tommy" [...] was christened as seriously as he would have been under a Christian roof and cried and was comforted in as orthodox fashion.|$|E
