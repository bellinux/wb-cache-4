25|$|The <b>Synod</b> <b>of</b> <b>Dort</b> was {{convened in}} 1610 {{in order to}} decide a {{controversy}} between the followers of Jacobus Arminius (Arminians), and other Calvinists. One of the issues involved {{had to do with}} the reason for the limitation of the efficacy of Christ's satisfaction for sin (roughly, atonement). Both sides of the controversy agreed that this efficacy was limited to the elect, and that the death of Christ was sufficient payment for the sin of the whole world. The disagreement {{had to do with the}} grounds for this limitation. For Arminius, the ground was the free choice of people to believe, foreknown by God, with God predestining people based on this foreseen faith. For the opponents of Arminius, whose views are represented in the Canons of Dort, this efficacy was limited based on God's predestination, without any foreknowledge of human choice. Calvin clearly taught this second view, and it is also the view of Reformed theologians following the <b>Synod</b> <b>of</b> <b>Dort.</b>|$|E
25|$|After the Reformation, Protestant groups {{continued}} to splinter, {{leading to a}} range of new theologies. The Enthusiasts were so named because of their emotional zeal. These included the Methodists, the Quakers, and the Baptists. Another group sought to reconcile Christian faith with modernist ideas, sometimes causing them to reject beliefs they considered to be illogical, including the Nicene creed and Chalcedonian Creed. These included Unitarians and Universalists. A major issue for Protestants became the degree to which people contribute to their salvation. The debate is often viewed as synergism versus monergism, though the labels Calvinist and Arminian are more frequently used, referring to the conclusion of the <b>Synod</b> <b>of</b> <b>Dort.</b>|$|E
25|$|Puritans {{were blocked}} from {{changing}} the established church from within, and were severely restricted in England by laws controlling {{the practice of}} religion. Their beliefs, however, were transported by the emigration of congregations to the Netherlands (and later to New England), and by evangelical clergy to Ireland (and later into Wales), and were spread into lay society {{and parts of the}} educational system, particularly certain colleges of the University of Cambridge. They took on distinctive beliefs about clerical dress and in opposition to the episcopal system, particularly after the 1619 conclusions of the <b>Synod</b> <b>of</b> <b>Dort</b> they were resisted by the English bishops. They largely adopted Sabbatarianism in the 17th century, and were influenced by millennialism.|$|E

It rejected the requests of the provinces of Brabant and Drenthe for representation on the States General. Seemingly, the results of the attempt at constitutional reform were meagre therefore. But appearances were not what they seemed. There had been a sea change in the political balance within the union by the elimination of the person who held five stadtholderships in his hand. The position of Holland became unassailable, on the one hand, because the other provinces were internally divided, and because there was not one leader (like the stadtholder had been) to lead them in opposition to Holland.|$|E
2500|$|Before the court, Paget and {{his fellow}} ministers were {{challenged}} by Morton to produce arguments against signing with the cross in baptism, a practice condemned by Puritans. Initially they refused, {{on the grounds that}} the demand was essentially for self-incrimination. Morton reassured them on this point and Paget spoke eloquently on behalf of the rest, to the surprise of Morton, who confessed he had not expected a learned response and reserved his own arguments for later. He ordered each of the accused ministers to commit three distinct arguments on the subject to paper and to present them to him within a month. Paget attended Morton three times at Chester over a two-week period, suffering the [...] "blasphemous swearing and cursing" [...] of the bishop's attendant and [...] "two Popish Gentlemen" [...] of an aristocrat's entourage. Paget never received a response directly from Morton. However, he was dismissed, after threats of suspension and even excommunication, with no more than a warning and a bill for court charges, towards which the bishop gave him ten shillings. Shortly afterwards, Morton published A Defence of the Innocencie of the Three Ceremonies of the Church of England, viz., the Surplice, Crosse after Baptisme, and Kneeling at the Receiving of the Blessed Sacrament. A gentle and eirenic work, it was apparently in part a response to the Lancashire Puritans. The king's positive response to the sternly Calvinist 1618 <b>Synod</b> <b>of</b> <b>Dort</b> stressed that the issues between the Church of England bishops and their Puritan ministers were at this stage largely confined to liturgical practice, rather than the deeper questions of soteriology and justification debated at the synod.|$|E

2500|$|Briget and Robert {{first issued}} John's Meditations of Death in 1639, with a preface over Robert's name. Briget wrote the dedication, {{which was to}} Elizabeth of Bohemia. Next, in 1641, came John's Defence of Church-government, a {{detailed}} exposition and defence of the Presbyterian polity as he had practised and experienced it in Amsterdam. The preface, again credited to Robert Paget, situated the work within John Paget's controversies with the Amsterdam separatists. Robert's concluding peroration began with the words: [...] "Farewell from Dort: Where a most pregnant & effectuall testimonie hath been given, for the needfull authority of Synods." [...] This reference to the <b>Synod</b> <b>of</b> <b>Dort</b> placed Paget's work within the mainstream Calvinist tradition by harking back to the past. By this time Charles I's attempts to impose the Prayer Book on an unwilling Scotland had led to the Bishops' Wars and the bankrupting of his attempt at absolute monarchy, forcing him {{to fall back on}} Parliament. Thomas Paget, closely following developments in England, re-purposed his brother's book as a political intervention. A Puritan petition from Cheshire to the Long Parliament had proposed the abolition of bishops, canon law, the Prayer Book, and the Thirty-Nine Articles, provoking a concerted response from royalists headed by Sir Thomas Aston, 1st Baronet. Their petition supported episcopacy and denounced all Puritans as [...] "Schismatiques and Separatists." [...] Aston published alongside it a collection of documents under the title A Remonstrance Against Presbytery. Thomas Paget decided to present his brother's book to Parliament, adding by way of dedication a [...] "Humble Advertisment", which explained the history of nonconformity in the Diocese of Chester and highlighted his own sufferings for the cause, as well as distinguishing Presbyterianism from more radical Puritan tendencies. Drawing on their Dutch experience, he pointed out that [...] "The United Netherlands doe finde by experience that Presbytery is no way to conducible to Anarchie." ...|$|E

Apparently his fault {{was the general}} one, of having miseducated the Prince, and introduced these French Literatures, foreign poisonous elements of thought and practice {{into the mind of}} his Pupil, which have ruined the young man. For his Majesty perceives that there lies the source of it; that only total perversion of the heart and judgment, first of all, can have brought about these dreadful issues of conduct. And indeed his Majesty understands, on credible information, that Deserter Fritz entertains very heterodox opinions; opinion on Predestination, for one;--which is itself calculated to be the very mother of mischief, in a young mind inclined to evil. The heresy about Predestination, or the [...] "FREIE GNADENWAHL (Election by Free Grace)," [...] as his Majesty terms it, according to which a man is preappointed from all Eternity either to salvation or the opposite (which is Fritz's notion, and indeed is Calvin's, and that of many benighted creatures, this Editor among them), appears to his Majesty an altogether shocking one; nor would the whole <b>Synod</b> <b>of</b> <b>Dort,</b> or Calvin, or St. Augustine in person, aided by a Thirty-Editor power, reconcile his Majesty's practical judgment to such a tenet. What! May not Deserter Fritz say to himself, even now, or in whatever other deeps of sin he may fall into, [...] "I was foredoomed to it: how could I, or how can I, help it?" [...] The mind of his Majesty shudders, as if looking over the edge of an abyss. He is meditating much whether nothing can be done to save the lost Fritz, at least the soul of him, from this horrible delusion:--hurls forth your fine Duhan, with his metaphysics, to remote Memel, as the first step. And signifies withal, though as yet only historically and in a speculative way, to Finkenstein and Kalkstein themselves, That their method of training up a young soul, to do God's will, and accomplish useful work in this world, does by no means appear to the royal mind an admirable one!
