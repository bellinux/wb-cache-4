40|$|Introduction: Food allergy is an immune-mediated {{hypersensitivity}} to allergens in food. This allergy affects about 6 - 8 % {{of children}} younger than three years, about 4 % of school-age children and about 2 % {{of the adult population}} in the world. Aim: To investigate the prevalence of food allergies in the population of preschool children from the city of Osijek and to identify the most common causes of these allergies in the study population. Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted during April and May 2007, among preschool children (mean age 5. 9 ± 0. 7 years, 401 / 810, 49. 5 % of boys and 409 / 810, 50. 5 % of girls) attending kindergartens in Osijek. The 810 parents of mentioned children filled out the specially designed questionnaire. The questionnaire contained questions on age, sex and body weight of the child, the existence of a diagnosis of food allergy and type of food allergy. Results: In the studied population of preschool children there were 5. 4 % (44 / 810) of children diagnosed with food allergies. The most common causes of food allergies in the study population were different food additives (40. 9 %), eggs (18. 2 %), peanut (13. 7 %), milk (9. 2 %) and honey, pesticides, fish and gluten with the same frequency of 4. 5 % each. Conclusion: Food allergies often occur among preschool children from the city of Osijek with the particularly significant prevalence of allergic reactions to various food additives.

40|$|As genetically {{modified}} (GM) products approach the market stage, the UK government and agro-food industry have faced a suspicious or hostile public. Since 1998 many retail chains have undertaken to <b>exclude</b> any GM-derived <b>ingredients</b> from their own-brand lines.

Political protest has led to strategies for precautionary commercialization. Government and industry have cooperated to plan a “managed development” of GM crops. Across the agricultural supply chain, industry has devised voluntary guidelines to ensure segregation of GM crops and to limit the spread of GM herbicide-tolerance. In particular UK regulators seek to test the risk that broad-spectrum herbicide sprays could damage wildlife habitats; they have broadened the advisory expertise accordingly. These measures open up the precautionary content to further debate, at both national and EU levels. Market-stage precautions establish a means to test claims that GM crops are environmentally-friendly products.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the evolution of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeasts during the fermentation of tarhana produced with some pasteurised ingredients and carried out at 30 and 40 C. The chemical parameters were those typical for tarhana production. Coliform bacteria were not detected during fermentation, while LAB and yeasts were in the range 107 e 108 colony forming units (CFU) g 1. Plate counts showed an optimal development of both fermenting microbial groups and the differences in cell concentrations were not significant (P > 0. 05). LAB were isolated during fermentation and grouped on the basis of phenotypic and polymorphic characteristics. LAB isolates were identified by a combined genetic approach consisting of 16 S/ 23 S rRNA intergenic spacer region (ITS) and partial 16 S rRNA gene sequencing as Pediococcus acidilactici, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus brevis. Hence, the pas- teurisation of the vegetable <b>ingredients,</b> <b>excluded</b> wheat flour, enhanced the hygienic conditions of tarhana without influencing the normal evolution of LAB. However, the fermentation at 40 C favoured pediococci, while the production at 30 C was mainly characterised by lactobacilli.

The traditional and only general method to deal with the consequent state explosion is forward-pruning: terminating a partial search when it is known that no better solution will subsequently be found. A different general method for reducing search, abstract interpretation, has traditionally been used in the area of program analysis. Here the idea was not to find optimal solutions (or any solution at all), but to <b>exclude</b> <b>specified</b> non-solutions. This method is not applicable for optimization because, in general, it introduces spurious solutions. In this paper, we consider a class of optimization problems where the feasible solutions can be formulated as an incrementing series of subsolutions, and the objective function is incremental. We then present a general method for using an arbitrary abstraction function in a search procedure which seeks an optimal solution. The motivation is that many problems possess some form of “similarity ” which can be captured formally by an abstraction function. The key feature of our method determines which part of the currently searched state can be abstracted, and how this abstraction can prune the search tree of a similar state...|$|R

Other sources of information used were reference lists, authors of previous studies, and meeting abstracts. STUDY SELECTION: In order for a study to be included in our analysis, it had to (1) appear in the peer-reviewed litera-ture and (2) investigate the effects of a PA program on <b>specified</b> drugs.

Our method is based on an explicit analytic integration of the single scattering light transport equations for an isotropic point light source in a homogeneous participating medium. We can implement the model in modern programmable graphics hardware using a few small numerical lookup tables stored as texture maps. Our model can also be easily adapted to generate the appearances of materials with arbitrary BRDFs, environment map lighting, and precomputed radiance transfer methods, in the presence of participating media. Hence, our techniques can be widely used in real-time rendering. ...|$|R

Journal of Dairy Science, 84, (5), 1109 - 1117. The objective of these experiments {{was to develop a}} simple in vitro technique for evaluating the production and neutralization of acid as feeds ferment in the rumen. An in vitro approach was adopted to eliminate animal factors. The procedure was based on the method of Tilley and Terry, with some modifications developed in this project. Residual acidity (acidogenicity value) was determined by the dissolution of Ca from CaCO 3 powder added to the media at the end of 24 -h incubations. Acidogenicity values (AV) were higher when 20 % strength buffer was used, while lowering buffer pH increased values, equally across all feeds. There was no effect of donor animal diet, but considerable day-to-day variation in the fermentation activity of rumen fluid. This variation likely reflected the substrate preferences of differing microbial populations, so that several standard feeds may be required to account for this effect. A series of 28 diverse feed ingredients was evaluated for AV using a mixture design, with 85 combinations of ingredients: 100 % of each ingredient (n = 28); 50 % of each ingredient and an equal mixture of all others (n = 28); equal mixture of all <b>ingredients,</b> <b>excluding</b> one (n = 28); and an equal mixture of all ingredients (n = 1). The effects of most ingredients on AV were essentially linear, though some extreme ingredients showed nonlinear effects. Protein sources had low AV, forages intermediate AV and starchy feeds high AV. Calcium contained within feeds contributed to AV, particularly for legumes, sugar beet pulp, and citrus pulp, and must be accounted for. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Mass balance approach and scenario analyses were used to gain insight into the climate impacts hotspots of the ice cream chain for Unilever in China. In the meanwhile, an overview of sub-systems concerned in the study, e. g. dairy farming systems and milking systems, was concisely ex-plained. Next to that, integrated scenario results were shown over what the carbon footprint of one litre ice cream is, and what options could decrease it. Overall, the carbon footprint of ice cream (only based on milk, <b>excluding</b> other <b>ingredients)</b> in China is 1. 2 - 1. 8 kg CO 2 equivalent per litre and energy use is 5. 8 - 10. 5 MJ per litre. Three stages of milk production on farms, manufacturing in plants and storing at selling points were found to be the GHG hotspots of the chain. The GWP mainly resulted from fossil fuels combustion for transportation and generation of electricity after the farm-gate. Carbon dioxide is the main GHG which has a significant influence on and contributes about 80 % to the total carbon footprint. Distributing ice cream to selling points with various distances may result in more emissions. Considering the complexity, general conclusions with regard to mitigating GHG emissions of the ice cream chain were drawn. Therefore, the most effective and pragmatic measures to decrease the cli-mate impact of ice cream from the perspective of ice cream chain for Unilever would be the follow-ing: mitigating the GHG emissions from dairy farms through effective manure management, replacing utilization of milk powders with liquid milk, planning the point of manufacturing to market served, and transforming energy mix through utilization of green energy,. This study did not come up with concrete policy recommendations but rather identifies a number of issues that merit further tailor-made investigations based on practical conditions in China. It will also contribute to a more detailed debate on policy proposals within different divisions of Unilever. ...|$|R

BACKGROUND: This is an update of the {{original}} Cochrane review, last published in 2009 (Huertas-Ceballos 2009). Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP), including children with irritable bowel syndrome, is a common problem affecting between 4 % and 25 % of school-aged children. For the majority of such children, no organic cause for their pain can be found on physical examination or investigation. Many dietary inventions have been suggested to improve the symptoms of RAP. These may involve either <b>excluding</b> <b>ingredients</b> from the diet or adding supplements such as fibre or probiotics. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effectiveness of dietary interventions in improving pain in children of school age with RAP. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, eight other databases, and two trials registers, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors, in June 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing dietary interventions with placebo or no treatment in children aged five to 18 years with RAP or an abdominal pain-related, functional gastrointestinal disorder, as defined by the Rome III criteria (Rasquin 2006). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We grouped dietary interventions together by category for analysis. We contacted study authors to ask for missing information and clarification, when needed. We assessed the quality of the evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: We included 19 RCTs, reported in 27 papers with a total of 1453 participants. Fifteen of these studies were not included in the previous review. All 19 RCTs had follow-up ranging from one to five months. Participants were aged between four and 18 years from eight different countries and were recruited largely from paediatric gastroenterology clinics. The mean age at recruitment ranged from 6. 3 years to 13. 1 years. Girls outnumbered boys in most trials. Fourteen trials recruited children with a diagnosis under the broad umbrella of RAP or functional gastrointestinal disorders; five trials specifically recruited only children with irritable bowel syndrome. The studies fell into four categories: trials of probiotic-based interventions (13 studies), trials of fibre-based interventions (four studies), trials of low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) diets (one study), and trials of fructose-restricted diets (one study). We found that children treated with probiotics reported a greater reduction in pain frequency at zero to three months postintervention than those given placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) - 0. 55, 95 % confidence interval (CI) - 0. 98 to - 0. 12; 6 trials; 523 children). There was also a decrease in pain intensity in the intervention group at the same time point (SMD - 0. 50, 95 % CI - 0. 85 to - 0. 15; 7 studies; 575 children). However, we judged the evidence for these outcomes to be of low quality using GRADE due to an unclear risk of bias from incomplete outcome data and significant heterogeneity. We found that children treated with probiotics were more likely to experience improvement in pain at zero to three months postintervention than those given placebo (odds ratio (OR) 1. 63, 95 % CI 1. 07 to 2. 47; 7 studies; 722 children). The estimated number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was eight, meaning that eight children would need to receive probiotics for one to experience improvement in pain in this timescale. We judged the evidence for this outcome to be of moderate quality due to significant heterogeneity. Children with a symptom profile defined as irritable bowel syndrome treated with probiotics were more likely to experience improvement in pain at zero to three months postintervention than those given placebo (OR 3. 01, 95 % CI 1. 77 to 5. 13; 4 studies; 344 children). Children treated with probiotics were more likely to experience improvement in pain at three to six months postintervention compared to those receiving placebo (OR 1. 94, 95 % CI 1. 10 to 3. 43; 2 studies; 224 children). We judged the evidence for these two outcomes to be of moderate quality due to small numbers of participants included in the studies. We found that children treated with fibre-based interventions were not more likely to experience an improvement in pain at zero to three months postintervention than children given placebo (OR 1. 83, 95 % CI 0. 92 to 3. 65; 2 studies; 136 children). There was also no reduction in pain intensity compared to placebo at the same time point (SMD - 1. 24, 95 % CI - 3. 41 to 0. 94; 2 studies; 135 children). We judged the evidence for these outcomes to be of low quality due to an unclear risk of bias, imprecision, and significant heterogeneity. We found only one study of low FODMAP diets and only one trial of fructose-restricted diets, meaning no pooled analyses were possible. We were unable to perform any meta-analyses for the secondary outcomes of school performance, social or psychological functioning, or quality of daily life, as not enough studies included these outcomes or used comparable measures to assess them. With the exception of one study, all studies reported monitoring children for adverse events; no major adverse events were reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found moderate- to low-quality evidence suggesting that probiotics may be effective in improving pain in children with RAP. Clinicians may therefore consider probiotic interventions as part of a holistic management strategy. However, further trials are needed to examine longer-term outcomes and to improve confidence in estimating the size of the effect, as well as to determine the optimal strain and dosage. Future research should also explore the effectiveness of probiotics in children with different symptom profiles, such as those with irritable bowel syndrome. We found only a small number of trials of fibre-based interventions, with overall low-quality evidence for the outcomes. There was therefore no convincing evidence that fibre-based interventions improve pain in children with RAP. Further high-quality RCTs of fibre supplements involving larger numbers of participants are required. Future trials of low FODMAP diets and other dietary interventions are also required to facilitate evidence-based recommendations...|$|R
40|$|During 1979 the National Drugs Advisory Board {{received}} 474 {{reports from}} which 873 side-effects were recorded. These figures {{are less than}} previously, but considering the problems accompanying the postal strike the National Drugs Advisory Board was pleased' that so many practitioners continued to maintain contact. Eight of the reports concerned interactions between drugs. The complicated interaction between amitriptyline and rauwolfia alkaloids emphasises the difficulty that can arise with multiple therapy, in this case each drug nullified the desired effect of the other. The use of additional therapy with the anticoagulant warfarin always requires great caution {{as shown by the}} interaction with carbimazole resulting in a prolonged prothrombin time. Eighteen deaths were reported in association with the use of drugs. Two cases of hepatic failure occurred, one with an antidepressant and one with perhexiline. There was another case of cardiac asystole following the use of salbutamol by inhalation and 2 cases of myocardial infarction, one of these secondary to coma induced by a relative overdose of antidepressant. Four of the deaths were related to infants with congenital abnormalities. In view of the difficulty in obtaining information on the precise timing of the medications it is impossible to assign a relationship to the drug ingestion with any great certainty. The National Drugs Advisory Board can only reiterate its firm recommendation that no medication should be used in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy unless it is absolutely essential. There was one death in an older woman who was sensitive to. sulphonamides and developed an erythroderma with indapamide, this progressed to an exfoliative dermatitis and was complicated by a myocardial infarction, ventricular fibrillation and consequent brain damage. Lithium Carbonate has been known to have as one of its pharmacological actions, a capacity to inhibit antidiuretic hormone. However recent reports suggest that the drug may also have a more direct effect on renal tubules even at acceptable plasma levels of drug. The National Drugs Advisory Board has received one report of renal insufficiency {{associated with the use of}} lithium carbonate. It is recommended that in addition to frequent and regular assays of serum lithium, creatinine clearance and serum creatinine should also be checked. One study has suggested that a reasonably simple screening procedure is the assessment of renal concentrating ability or osmolality regularly to detect progressive change. The case of fatal aplastic anaemia reported in association with long term use of a product containing propyphenazone has stimulated the reformulation of the product to <b>exclude</b> this <b>ingredient.</b> Products available without prescription should not contain ingredients capable of producing such serious side-effects. Ibuprofen which has been on the market for about 10 years was claimed for a long time to be free of any capacity to affect peptic ulceration or induce haematemesis. The present reports suggest that these side effects can occur especially with long term use. In addition the National Drugs Advisory Board has had reports of 4 cases of thrombocytoperia, one of which was fatal. Until now relatively few cases have been reported in the literature and it is uncertain whether this is a direct toxic effect or an allergic reaction...|$|R
