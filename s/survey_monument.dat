5000|$|The term [...] "Tallahassee meridian" [...] is also loosely used to {{describe}} the <b>survey</b> <b>monument</b> (see survey marker) located at the intersection of these lines of longitude and latitude (the longitude line being the [...] "Tallahassee meridian" [...] and the latitude line being the [...] "Tallahassee Parallel" [...] or “Tallahassee Base Line”). This <b>survey</b> <b>monument</b> serves as the initial point for U.S. government surveys in the state of Florida. The 6 mile × 6 mile townships originate from here and are numbered by township (see survey township) depending upon whether they are north or south of this point, and are numbered by [...] "range" [...] depending upon whether they are east or west of this point. Thus, Township 3 South Range 26 East would extend from approximately 12 to 18 miles South of the monument, and would be positioned from approximately 150 to 156 miles East of the monument. Each township/range is then divided into 36 sections of 1 mile by 1 mile each.|$|E

The monument marks {{the starting point of}} the land survey of the Kansas-Nebraska border along the 40th parallel north, which intersects the top of the Missouri River's western bluff at this spot. U.S. Deputy Surveyor Charles A. Manners erected the monument in 1855 {{at the beginning of the}} survey. In 1924, the monument was displaced and reset at the wrong location before Leo M.

The original sandstone monument was 6 ft tall. U.S. Deputy Surveyor Charles A. Manners set the monument in 1856. The monument was later buried under a county roadbed; it was unearthed and reburied twice before being dug up for good in 1986, though its middle section is now missing.|$|E

40|$|Survey monuments are {{physical}} markers {{indicating the}} location of land boundary corners, geodetic control points, or local control points. They enable a surveyor to relate narrative boundary descriptions or improvements, and boundaries drawn {{on a set of}} plans to the actual location on the ground. Why Are Survey Monuments Important? All real properties, such as parcels, lots, rights-of-way, and easements can only be located or staked on the ground by starting from a monument. Legal descriptions of the horizontal and vertical locations of properties and structures all require {{the location of}} a monument as their beginning point of reference. The accuracy and relevancy of the City’s Geographic Information System (GIS) maps are also based on survey monuments. The network of survey monuments protects and delineates public and private property, and is critical to the enforcement and enjoyment of real property rights. Survey monuments are important assets belonging to the City and its citizens, and are protected and maintained as such. How to Locate or Identify a <b>Survey</b> <b>Monument?</b> Most <b>Survey</b> <b>Monument</b> locations {{can be found in the}} City’s GIS system and on the City’s Quarter Section Maps (also called Engineering Maps). The City’s Survey Field Books can also help determine monument locations. These books may show how a monument was set, and what condition it was in when it was last seen. The books may also where there may be ties to a monument, if the monument has been buried or lost. Survey Monuments used for horizontal location are typically found in the City’s Right of Way (ROW), typically in the center of the ROW, and most often at intersections. However, some monuments hav...|$|E
40|$|The International Polar Year and the {{proposed}} development of the Mackenzie Delta gas reserves will focus attention on Arctic observation in the coming years. Methods of geodetic observation will be used alongside other scientific experiments {{to determine the effects}} of man-made and global warming changes to the environment, which will have impacts on civil infrastructure, and geological and ecological conditions. Changes in elevation are indicative of subsidence due to gas extraction, deepening of the permafrost active layer, the thawing of ground ice, and changes in the eco-system. The challenges of measuring elevation change in such a remote area, where there are few naturally stable areas or artificial benchmarks such as tide gauges, and where observations utilising conventional methods are hampered by the complex hydrol-ogy in the Mackenzie Delta, ensure the pre-eminence of global positioning in this area. Differential GPS (DGPS) levelling has its own unique challenges at 70 º North, such as degraded satellite geometry and increased ionospheric effects. In addition, the full error budget of a DGPS method includes the signal of the <b>survey</b> <b>monument</b> in the permafrost environment, which is subject to seasonal heave and settlement. This paper reports on two studies that, combined, indicate the accuracy that can be expected using DGPS levelling onto survey monuments in permafrost at this latitude. The Arctic regions of Canada will be subject to intense study in the coming years due to the planned production of gas in the Mackenzie Delt...|$|E
40|$|Abstract]: The {{surveying}} profession {{continues to}} suffer from a shortage of personnel {{in a time when}} demand for surveyors is increasing. Concurrently, the ongoing improvements in surveying technology have been proven in making surveys more efficient, thereby passing time savings on to clients and the general public who rely on an accurate system of land ownership. The current system of re-establishing boundaries in Australia is based on <b>survey</b> <b>monument</b> evidence, and relies on the education and experience of a Registered Cadastral Surveyor to make sense of this evidence. Given the shortage of surveyors, there is concern that surveying services may not be provided in a timely manner, or worse, that extra pressure on surveyors may lead to cases of incorrect boundary reestablishment. This project aims to investigate the potential for recent software technology to perform the boundary re-establishment process, with a view to alleviating the Registered Surveyors workload. To achieve this aim, a capable software program will be used to re-establish several general boundary problems, and these answers will be compared to that of a Registered Cadastral Surveyor and long established reinstatement doctrine. Results will show that in some of the tested scenarios the software solutions are the same as the human results, but many were found to be in disagreement. It will be observed that the methods used by the software in solving such problems are, although mathematically sound, not capable of the analysis and reasoning of a Registered Surveyor. This project will provide a foundation for future research into the programming of boundary reinstatement software, and will enable informed decision making in surveying practices as to the potential for this software to alleviate staff workloads...|$|E

40|$|As the 50 th {{anniversary of}} the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) draws near, the author was {{surprised}} to learn that the published latitude and longitude for CTIO in the Astronomical Almanac and iraf observatory database appears to differ from modern GPS-measured geodetic positions by nearly a kilometer. Surely, the position for CTIO could not be in error after five decades? The source of the discrepancy appears to be due to the ~ 30 " difference between the astronomical and geodetic positions [...] a systematic effect due to vertical deflection first reported by Harrington, Mintz Blanco, & Blanco (1972). Since the astronomical position is not necessarily the desired quantity for some calculations, and since the number of facilities on Cerro Tololo and neighboring Cerro Pachon has grown considerably over the years, I decided to measure accurate geodetic positions for all of the observatories and some select landmarks on the two peaks using GPS and Google Earth. Both sets of measurements were inter-compared, and externally compared to a high accuracy geodetic position for a NASA Space Geodesy Program <b>survey</b> <b>monument</b> on Tololo. I conclude that Google Earth can currently be used to determine absolute geodetic positions (i. e. compared to GPS) accurate to roughly +- 0. 15 " (+- 5 m) in latitude and longitude without correction, or approximately +- 0 ". 10 (+- 3 m) with correction. I tabulate final geodetic and geocentric positions on the WGS- 84 coordinate system for all astronomical observatories on Cerro Tololo and Cerro Pachon with accuracy +- 0 ". 1 (+- 3 m). One surprise is that an oft-cited position for LSST is in error by 9. 4 km and the quoted elevation is in error by 500 m. Comment: 13 pages, 6 figures. Unsolicited technical report for CTIO.
