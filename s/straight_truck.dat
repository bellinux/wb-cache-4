In April 1977, at the New Orleans Superdome, the all-new S-series medium-duty trucks were introduced. {{as a replacement}} for the International Harvester Fleetstar. In 1979, other versions of the S-Series were introduced to succeed the Loadstar-series. Like the Loadstar, the S-Series were <b>straight</b> <b>trucks</b> commonly used for local delivery; the versions replacing the Fleetstar were semi-tractors or severe-service <b>straight</b> <b>trucks.</b> Additionally, the S-Series (and its replacement, the 3800) proved popular in the school bus industry. The S-Series was the last product line designed from the ground up by International Harvester themselves; it was produced in its original form {{until the end of the}} 1980s.

50|$|The “U” and “DM” series were {{modifications}} of the “R” series. A short hood, and the shorter “bumper to back of cab” distance, made them useful in <b>straight</b> <b>trucks</b> and in semi-tractors used in congested cities, but caused {{the engine to}} intrude into the passenger compartment.

50|$|Truck-driving {{country is}} a subgenre of country and western music. It is characterised by lyrical content about trucks (i.e. {{commercial}} vehicles, not pick-up trucks), truck drivers or truckers, and the trucking industry experience. This would include, for example, references to truck stops, CB (Citizens Band) radio, geography, drugs, teamsters, roads, weather, fuel, law enforcement, loads, traffic, ICC (Interstate Commerce Commission), contraband, DOT (Department of Transportation), accidents, etc. In truck-driving country, references to “truck” include the following truck types: 10 wheeler, <b>straight</b> <b>truck,</b> 18 wheeler, tractor (bobtail), semi, tractor-trailer, semi tractor trailer, big rig, and some others.|$|E
50|$|VT 108 {{passes through}} {{the area of the}} Mount Mansfield State Forest. It starts in Stowe and goes through Smugglers' Notch to Jeffersonville. The road cuts through Mount Mansfield. The road is very steep and turning, making it {{impossible}} to plow in the winter, so the road is closed usually from mid-October until May. Tractor-trailers are barred from this section, and large <b>straight</b> <b>trucks,</b> buses and RVs are strongly encouraged to find other routes year-round. However, skiers come from alternate routes to cross-country, downhill ski, and snow mobile in the Smuggler's Notch Resort. Along the road, there are small parking areas where rock climbing and hiking are popular.|$|R
50|$|In the end, {{the route}} {{amounted}} to almost 23 miles of single track (on the Nocton Estate alone). Eventually {{they were to}} operate over 30 miles of line in total. Almost every field on the large estates was reached so that produce could be harvested <b>straight</b> onto <b>trucks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{noticeable}} {{difference between}} tractor units in Europe and North America is {{that almost all}} European models are cab over engine (called [...] "forward control" [...] in England), {{while the majority of}} North American trucks are [...] "conventional" [...] (called [...] "normal control" [...] or [...] "bonneted" [...] in England). European <b>trucks,</b> whether <b>straight</b> <b>trucks</b> or fully articulated, have a sheer face on the front. This allows shorter trucks with longer trailers (with larger freight capacity) within the legal maximum total length. Furthermore, it offers greater maneuverability and better overall view for the driver. The major disadvantage is that for repairs on COE trucks the entire cab has to hinge forward to allow maintenance access. Conversely, [...] "conventional" [...] cab tractors offer the driver a more comfortable driving environment and better protection in a collision.|$|R
