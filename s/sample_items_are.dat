30|$|Learning and {{developmental}} {{opportunities in the}} organization was assessed with a four items scale from the learning culture inventory in organizations (LKI) developed by Sonntag and colleagues (Sonntag and Stegmaier 2008). <b>Sample</b> <b>items</b> <b>are</b> „The organization offers a large program for advanced education“, and “Opportunities for further training and competency development are tailored {{to the needs of}} us employees”. Job control was measured with six items from the Work Design Questionnaire (WDQ) originally developed by Morgeson and Humphrey (2006). We used items from the German WDQ (Stegmann et al. 2010). To obtain a score for the overall extent of autonomy and control at work, we combined the sub-scales for work scheduling autonomy and decision making authority. <b>Sample</b> <b>items</b> <b>are</b> “the job allows me to make my own decisions about how to schedule my work”, “the job allows me to plan how I do my work”, “the job gives me a chance to use my personal initiative or judgment in carrying out my work”, and “the job allows me {{to make a lot of}} decisions on my own”.

3000|$|The 21 -item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS 21; Lovibond and Lovibond, [1995]) {{was used}} to measure the {{presence}} of negative emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress. The depression subscale measures hopelessness, anhedonia, lack of interest, and a <b>sample</b> <b>item</b> <b>is</b> “I felt that life was meaningless”. The anxiety subscale is an indication of one’s subjective experience of autonomic arousal and anxious affect, and a <b>sample</b> <b>item</b> <b>is</b> “I felt I was close to panic”. The stress subscale assesses levels of chronic non-specific arousal such as being easily agitated or irritable, and having difficulty relaxing, and a <b>sample</b> <b>item</b> <b>is</b> “I found it difficult to relax”. For each <b>item,</b> participants <b>were</b> asked to indicate {{the degree to which the}} statement applied to them over the past week, on a scale of 0 (Did not apply to me at all) to 3 (Applied to me very much, or most of the time). Scores of each of the subscales were calculated by summing the scores of the seven items in each subscale and multiplied by two to obtain comparable scores to the published norms for the DASS. The DASS has been shown to have high internal consistency and temporal reliability (Lovibond and Lovibond, [1995]), as well as good convergent and discriminant validity (Antony et al., [1998]). In the current study, alpha coefficients for the depression, anxiety and stress subscales were [...]. 88, [...]. 80, and [...]. 84, respectively.|$|R

30|$|The refined SIQ {{includes}} 50 items assessing {{ability to}} make plans; take care of yourself/others; leisure activities; social functioning; physical functioning; sleep; memory/cognitive issues; work; and emotional functioning (Table 1), using a 5 -point Likert-type response scale. The questionnaire assesses the degree of impact SLE has on various aspects of an individual’s life. As such, a numeric rating of this impact would not necessarily be familiar or meaningful to patients. The response options utilized are standard response options {{that are used in}} many PRO questionnaires including the FACIT measurement system [12]. In addition, unlike the SSD, which is administered daily, the SIQ is administered weekly, as symptom impacts are less likely to change on a daily basis. Sixty-nine percent of patients asked (n =[*] 9 / 13) thought the time frame of the past 7  days was appropriate. A Likert-type scale is appropriate for detecting these changes in impacts, as it is easy for respondents to understand and still sensitive enough to detect subtle changes [26]. For the majority of items, the response scale ranges from “Not at all” to “Very much”; three items have responses ranging from “None of the time” to “All of the time”. <b>Sample</b> <b>items</b> <b>are</b> provided in Table 4.|$|E
40|$|Few {{instruments}} {{have been}} developed for evaluation of expressive vocabulary in early childhood. This project attempted to develop an instrument sufficiently structured to call forth appropriate verbalization vet varied enough to elicit a wide range of responses, and to use the instrument to test whether socioeconomic class groupings can be differentiated by the auantity and quality of the child's verbal output. The Expressive Vocabulary Inventory (EVI), he instrument developed, consists of 40 items in which the child is shown a line-drawing and asked a question to which he answers the appropriate word or phrase. The EVI was given to 204 boys and 226 7 irls (145 Caucasian and 285 Negro, 300 low and 130 hiah socioeconomic status categories) in throe age groups (36 - 47 months, 40 - 9 months, and 60 - 71 months). No statistically significant differences for sex were obtained within any of the age groups. Some support for a cumulative decrement could be seen by comparing the difference at age 3 with that at age 5, but the small number of [...] -year- old children confounded the expected decrement with increase in age for the lower economic status children.

40|$|Classic {{studies of}} visual {{short-term}} memory (VSTM) found that presenting memory items either sequentially or simultaneously {{does not affect}} recognition accuracy of the remembered items. Other studies also suggest that capacity of VSTM benefits from formation of bound object-based representations leading to no cost of remembering multi-feature items. According to these ideas, we aimed to examine the role of temporal and featural separation of memory items in VSTM change detection, (1) if <b>sample</b> <b>items</b> <b>are</b> separated across different temporal moments and (2) if across different feature dimensions. In a series of change detection experiments, we asked participants to report a change between a sample and a test display with a brief delay in between. In experiment 1, the sample items were split into two sets with a different onset time. In experiment 2, the sample items were split across two different feature dimensions (e. g., half color and half orientation). The change detection accuracy in Experiment 1 showed no substantial drop when the memory items were separated into two onset groups compared to simultaneous onset. The accuracy did not drop either when the features of sample items were split across two different feature groups compared to when were not split. The results indicate that temporal and featural separation of VWM items does not {{play a significant role}} for VSTM-based change detection...|$|E

A sample of fathers (n = 109) who had attended a court ordered divorce education program completed mailed surveys assessing various aspects of their co-parenting relationship with their ex-spouse. Co-parenting was measured using two scales consisting of 12 and 14 items respectively designed to measure perceived co-parenting strategies of each parent. <b>Sample</b> <b>items</b> <b>are</b> as follows: "I use our child to get back at my ex-wife," "My ex-wife uses our child to get back at me," and "I deliver messages to my ex-wife through our child rather than say them to her directly. " Results showed that fathers' perceptions of their own co-parenting strategies as well as their perceptions of their ex-wives co-parenting strategies were significantly related to how often the children spent the night at their fathers' homes and to how often fathers visited with their children. Fathers' perceptions of their own co-parenting strategies, but not their perceptions of their ex-wives' co-parenting strategies, was significantly related to how often fathers talked to their child. The fathers' income and amount of child support paid per month were significantly related to all three types of contact (i. e., overnight stays, frequency of talking with child, and frequency of visits). In addition, the length of the father's marriage to his ex-wife was significantly related to how often the child spent the night. These results show the importance of fathers' perceptions of the co-parenting relationship quality on their reported contact with their nonresidential children. Implications will be drawn from this study for parent educators and others who work with divorced parents...|$|E
