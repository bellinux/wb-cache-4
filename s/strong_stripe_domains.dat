40|$|Motivated by {{the recent}} {{experimental}} observations on the skyrmion creation by cutting chiral <b>stripe</b> <b>domains</b> under a current drive [Jiang et al., Science 349, 283 (2015) ], we study the mechanism of skyrmion generation by simulating the dynamics of <b>stripe</b> <b>domains.</b> Our theory for skyrmion generation {{is based on the}} fact that there are two half skyrmions attached to the ends of a <b>stripe</b> <b>domain.</b> These half skyrmions move due to the coupling between the skyrmion topological charge and current. As a consequence, the <b>stripe</b> <b>domain</b> is bent or stretched depending on the direction of motion of the half skyrmions. For a large current, skyrmions are created by chopping the <b>stripe</b> <b>domains</b> via <b>strong</b> bending or stretching.

40|$|International audienceSelf-organization is an {{interesting}} route to the fabrication of nanostructured magnetic materials. Here we show that, near room temperature, an ultrathin Fe film deposited on a suitable MnAs template spontaneously breaks into a ``lateral'' superlattice of magnetic stripes. The magnetic superstructure originates from the temperature-dependent morphological change in the substrate: an epitaxially grown MnAs/GaAs(001) film, whose groove-ridge structure was investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy. Owing to the stray magnetic fields produced by the underlying MnAs template, the Fe <b>stripe</b> <b>domains</b> have opposite magnetizations, and behave essentially as independent magnetic entities because of <b>strong</b> <b>stripe</b> edge pinning. This is shown dramatically {{in terms of a}} split microwave resonance that can be controlled with an external magnetic field, as proved by Brillouin light-scattering data and analysis of the Fe spin-wave frequencies.

The <b>stripe</b> <b>domain</b> structure when the external field is along the long axis of the bar is shown to be generated by a standing wave mode, which has the same spatial structure as the stripes. At all fields this mode has the lowest frequency of all the standing wave modes. This mode goes soft at a second order phase transition where the <b>stripe</b> <b>domains</b> emerge. For other directions of the field, the symmetry of soft modes is found to be consistent with the change in symmetry of the ground state and that the phase transition can be first order.

40|$|Magnetic lateral multilayers {{have been}} {{fabricated}} on weak perpendicular magnetic anisotropy amorphous Nd-Co films {{in order to}} perform a systematic study on the conditions for controlled nucleation of topological defects within their magnetic <b>stripe</b> <b>domain</b> pattern. A lateral thickness modulation of period w is defined on the nanostructured samples that, in turn, induces a lateral modulation of both magnetic <b>stripe</b> <b>domain</b> periods λ and average in-plane magnetization component M_inplane. Depending on lateral multilayer period and in-plane applied field, thin and thick regions switch independently during in-plane magnetization reversal and domain walls are created within the in-plane magnetization configuration coupled to variable angle grain boundaries and disclinations within the magnetic <b>stripe</b> <b>domain</b> patterns. This process is mainly driven by the competition between rotatable anisotropy (that couples the magnetic stripe pattern to in-plane magnetization) and in-plane shape anisotropy induced by the periodic thickness modulation. However, as the structural period w becomes comparable to magnetic stripe period λ, the nucleation of topological defects at the interfaces between thin and thick regions is hindered by a size effect and <b>stripe</b> <b>domains</b> in the different thickness regions become strongly coupled.

40|$|The {{magnetization}} {{reversal in}} a series of rf-sputtered FeSiAl(N) films has been studied using magnetic force microscopy. A system has been developed which has the capability to image domain structure while an in-plane magnetic field is applied in situ. All films exhibited a <b>stripe</b> <b>domain</b> structure in zero applied field which was indicative of a perpendicular component of domain magnetization which alternates in sign. All films showed a similar sequence of magnetization processes: on reducing the applied field from saturation a fine <b>stripe</b> <b>domain</b> structure nucleated and then coarsened as the field was decreased to zero. Local switching of domain contrast was observed along the steepest part of the hysteresis loop as the perpendicular component reversed. As the reverse field was increased toward saturation, the <b>stripe</b> <b>domains</b> disintegrated into smaller regions. This observation is consistent with an interpretation that the domain magnetization rotated locally into the sample plane. The saturation field and the film stress exhibited similar trends with nitrogen partial pressure. The results suggest that the perpendicular anisotropy that caused the formation of the <b>stripe</b> <b>domain</b> structure could be induced by the film stress via magnetoelastic coupling...|$|R
40|$|X-ray {{diffraction}} {{and magnetic}} force microscopy techniques were used to investigate the structural and the static magnetic properties of vapor-deposited cobalt films with various thicknesses t ranging from 50 to 195 nm.

Magnetic <b>stripe</b> <b>domains</b> structure was only observed for the thicker films, with t= 195, 173 and 125  nm, while such a magnetic configuration was expected for all the samples based on the theoretical studies.

40|$|<b>Stripe</b> <b>domains</b> are narrow, elongated, {{reversed}} {{regions that}} exist in magnetic materials with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. <b>Stripe</b> <b>domains</b> appear {{as a pair of}} domain walls that can exhibit topology with a nonzero chirality. Recent experimental and numerical investigations identify an instability of <b>stripe</b> <b>domains</b> in the long direction as a means of nucleating isolated magnetic skyrmions. Here, the onset and nonlinear evolution of transverse instabilities for a dynamic <b>stripe</b> <b>domain</b> known as the bion stripe are investigated. Both non-topological and topological variants of the bion stripe are shown to exhibit a long-wavelength transverse instability with different characteristic features. In the former, small transverse variations in the stripe's width lead to a neck instability that eventually pinches the non-topological stripe into a chain of two-dimensional breathers composed of droplet soliton pairs. In the latter case, small variations in the stripe's center results in a snake instability whose topological structure leads to the nucleation of dynamic magnetic skyrmions and antiskyrmions as well as perimeter-modulated droplets. Quantitative, analytical predictions for both the early, linear evolution and the long-time, nonlinear evolution are achieved using an averaged Lagrangian approach that incorporates both exchange (dispersion) and anisotropy (nonlinearity). The method of analysis is general and can be applied to other filamentary structures. Comment: 8 figures, 13 page...|$|R

The exact analytical solution provides a new basis for precise characterization of uniaxial magnetic films and plates, illustrated by a simple way to measure the domain wall energy.

Past results have demonstrated that solid and ripple phases exhibit rich textural patterns related to the orientational order of tilted lipids and the orientation of ripple corrugations. Here we reveal a highly complex network pattern of ripple and solid domains in DLPC, DPPC bilayers with structures covering length scales from 10 nm to 100 μm. Using spincoated double supported membranes we investigate domains by correlated AFM and fluorescence microscopy. Cooling experiments demonstrate the mode of nucleation and growth of <b>stripe</b> <b>domains</b> enriched in the fluorescent probe. Concurrent AFM imaging reveals that these <b>stripe</b> <b>domains</b> have a one-to-one correspondence with a rippled morphology running parallel to the stripe direction.
