40|$|Apparatus for {{multiplexing}} <b>switch</b> <b>state</b> signals comprises {{a plurality}} of switches and parallel weighted resistors connected in series between circuit ground and a node at a utilization device. The resistors are weighted {{as a function of}} a power of the same base, such as the power of the base 2, for coding the multiplexed <b>switch</b> <b>state</b> signals. A constant current source connected between the node and circuit ground drives current over a single cable conductor through the resistor. Each switch may be independently closed to change the <b>switch</b> <b>state</b> voltage signals multiplexed to the node. An analog-to-digital converter connected between the node and circuit ground demultiplexes the <b>switch</b> <b>state</b> signals received at the node and provides a <b>switch</b> <b>state</b> signal at each analog-to-digital output corresponding to the <b>state</b> of the <b>switches</b> at the moment. A potentiometer may replace a resistor and bypass switch combination in a position where the potentiometer has a maximum value of the lowest power of the base in order to multiplex a true analog voltage signal while <b>switch</b> <b>state</b> signals are unambiguously coded and multiplexed. The potentiometer in the least significant position permits the analog value to be in the range from 0 to a maximum corresponding to the least significant position of the <b>switch</b> <b>state</b> encoding. The invention may be used in redundancy systems by duplicating the invention with corresponding switches in each duplication ganged to open and close simultaneously upon operation of a pushbutton switch...|$|R

40|$|In a three-level flying {{capacitor}} inverter, certain <b>switching</b> <b>state</b> sequences can cause an undesirable transient in the pole voltage. The transients constitute and error voltage which degrades harmonic performance, distorts {{the current and}} generates electromagnetic noise. This paper presents a scheme to completely eliminate these dead-time transients using a digital state machine to determine the <b>switching</b> <b>state</b> to be applied in the subsequent switching period based on the present <b>switching</b> <b>state.</b> The modified <b>switching</b> <b>state</b> {{does not change the}} effective phase voltage, and the floating capacitors are kept well balanced. The proposed scheme works independent of the modulation or control scheme in use. The scheme was first tested in simulation, followed by deployment on an FPGA for hardware validation and timing analysis...|$|R
30|$|Routing {{protocols}} {{could also}} be designed to solve specific problems, such as the MSCRP trying to solve deafness problem [16] and local coordination-based routing focusing on load balancing [20]. MSCRP applies node states and deafness problem constraint. Each node must be {{in one of the}} three node states: single-channel <b>state,</b> <b>switching</b> <b>state,</b> and non-free state. When there is no flow across a node or there are flows only on the channel where the node stays, that node is at single-channel state. When the flows are distributed on different channels, the node is at <b>switching</b> <b>state.</b> A node is at non-free state when it is a neighbor of a <b>switching</b> <b>state</b> node. After applying those states, the deafness problem constraint is defined as two consecutive nodes in a flow cannot be simultaneously at <b>switching</b> <b>state.</b>|$|R

50|$|The third category, space-vector-based modulation, generates PWM {{load line}} {{currents}} that equal load line currents, on average. Valid <b>switching</b> <b>states</b> and time selections are made digitally based on space vector transformation. Modulating signals are {{represented as a}} complex vector using a transformation equation. For balanced three-phase sinusoidal signals, this vector becomes a fixed module, which rotates at a frequency, ω. These space vectors are then used to approximate the modulating signal. If the signal is between arbitrary vectors, the vectors are combined with the zero vectors I7, I8, or I9. The following equations are used {{to ensure that the}} generated currents and the current vectors are on average equivalent.|$|E
5000|$|Inverter {{circuits}} {{designed to}} produce a variable output voltage range are often used within motor speed controllers.The DC power for the inverter section {{can be derived from}} a normal AC wall outlet or some other source. Control and feedback circuitry is used to adjust the final output of the inverter section which will ultimately determine the speed of the motor operating under its mechanical load. Motor speed control needs are numerous and include things like: industrial motor driven equipment, electric vehicles, rail transport systems, and power tools.(See related: variable-frequency drive [...] )<b>Switching</b> <b>states</b> are developed for positive, negative and zero voltages as per the patterns given in the switching Table 1.The generated gate pulses are given to each switch in accordance with the developed pattern and thus the output is obtained.|$|E
50|$|If the {{external}} process which presents the two potential states to awareness is interrupted (by means of removing the stimulus), {{the state of}} potential consciousness will remain on the most recently collapsed visual percept. Furthermore, since {{the external}} stimulation of the rival state has been halted, alterations of the perceptual states should not occur since the likelihood associated with the other percept has been removed. Thus, once a new stimulation where both states are reintroduced to awareness, evolution {{of the state of}} potential consciousness begins with the most previously collapsed state. In effect, the state of potential consciousness will collapse again in the previously collapsed state with a higher probability. It can be therefore deduced that when the process of introducing a stimulus to awareness is interrupted, the time evolution of the state of potential consciousness is halted, and the frequency of <b>switching</b> <b>states</b> after presenting the stimuli again is significantly reduced. These predications are consistent with the previous works of Brascamp et al., where it was shown that the reversal frequency of rival states decreases by increasing blank (stimulus removal) intervals.|$|E

5000|$|Two {{significant}} {{design challenges}} for MOSFET driver circuits in class-D amplifiers are keeping dead times and linear mode operation {{as short as}} possible. [...] "Dead time" [...] is the period during a switching transition when both output MOSFETs are driven into Cut-Off Mode and both are [...] "off". Dead times need to be as short as possible to maintain an accurate low-distortion output signal, but dead times that are too short cause the MOSFET that is switching on to start conducting before the MOSFET that is switching off has stopped conducting. The MOSFETs effectively short the output power supply through themselves in a condition known as [...] "shoot-through". Meanwhile, the MOSFET drivers also need to drive the MOSFETs between <b>switching</b> <b>states</b> {{as fast as possible}} to minimize the amount of time a MOSFET is in Linear Mode—the state between Cut-Off Mode and Saturation Mode where the MOSFET is neither fully on nor fully off and conducts current with a significant resistance, creating significant heat. Driver failures that allow shoot-through and/or too much linear mode operation result in excessive losses and sometimes catastrophic failure of the MOSFETs.|$|E
