500|$|Pinchbeck South Fen is {{a region}} {{covering}} [...] {{lying on the}} west side of Vernatt's Drain. It was originally managed as the Fourth District by the Deeping Fen trustees, but was independent in 1828, when the occupants approached the trustees with a plan to drain some of the water from the fen to the Pode Hole pumps. A tunnel already existed under Vernatt's drain, and so the trustees agreed. However, the charges levied by the trustees for this service rose dramatically, so that the South Fen residents decided to build their own pumping engine at Pode Hole in 1830. A Fenton & Murray beam engine driving a [...] scoop wheel was installed, at a cost of £3,000, which was considerably less than the charge the trustees wanted to make. The engine was replaced by a <b>suction</b> <b>gas</b> engine and Ruston pump in 1919, which was decommissioned in 1943 when a Petter oil engine with a [...] Gwynnes pump was installed. This only lasted for ten years, as two electric motors driving [...] and [...] pumps were fitted in 1953.|$|E
2500|$|The mill {{is seven}} storeys tall, with a three-storey smock on a four-storey brick base, which consist of basement, ground, {{first and second}} floors. It cost £3,500 to build in 1814. The overall height to the cap roof is [...] The mill was {{originally}} built with Common sails and a wooden windshaft, with a wide stage. In 1840, Samuel Medhurst, the Lewes millwright, fitted a cast-iron windshaft, and patent sails, which span [...] [...] The internal wooden machinery was also replaced with cast iron. George Warren, the Hawkhurst millwright fitted a fantail a few years later, giving the mill its current appearance. A [...] steam powered beam engine by Middleton of Southwark, Surrey, was added in 1863, along with an extra pair of millstones from a steam mill in Smarden. In 1880, the wooden stage was replaced with a narrower one of iron, as the wide one was not needed with patent sails. This work {{was carried out by}} Warren. The beam engine was replaced in 1890 by a rotary steam engine made by Clarke's of Ashford. This was unsatisfactory and was replaced with a Fowler horizontal steam engine after a year or two. This engine was replaced by a <b>suction</b> <b>gas</b> engine in 1919. Second hand sails from Sarre Windmill were fitted in 1920. [...] In the 1920s, a pair of sails was bought from Beacon Mill, Benenden for re-erection on the mill, but they proved not to be suitable. A pair of [...] diameter millstones from Beacon Mill was installed in the mill about this time. The mill also had a pair of [...] diameter French Burr millstones and a pair of [...] Peak millstones. The mill worked for a few years longer powered by a gas engine, but had ceased milling by the early 1930s, but milling was restarted again. The gas engine was replaced by an electric motor in 1954.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of open endotracheal <b>suctioning</b> on <b>gas</b> exchange and respiratory mechanics in ARF patients under the modes of PCV or VCV. Ninety-six ARF patients were treated with open endotracheal suctioning and their variations in respiratory mechanics and gas exchange after the suctions were compared. Under PCV mode, compared with the initial level of tidal volume (VT), ARF patients showed 30. 0 % and 27. 8 % decrease at 1 [*]min and 10 [*]min, respectively. Furthermore, the initial respiratory system compliance (Crs) decreased by 29. 6 % and 28. 5 % at 1 [*]min and 10 [*]min, respectively. Under VCV mode, compared with the initial level, 38. 6 % and 37. 5 % increase in peak airway pressure (PAP) were found at 1 [*]min and 10 [*]min, respectively. Under PCV mode, the initial PaO 2 increased by 6. 4 % and 10. 2 % at 3 [*]min and 10 [*]min, respectively, while 18. 9 % and 30. 6 % increase of the initial PaO 2 were observed under VCV mode. Summarily, endotracheal <b>suctioning</b> may impair <b>gas</b> exchange and decrease lung compliance in ARF patients receiving mechanical ventilation under both PCV and VCV modes, but endotracheal <b>suctioning</b> effects on <b>gas</b> exchange were more severe and longer-lasting under PCV mode than VCV...|$|R

50|$|Depending on {{the vessel}} used, the gas created may be under a slight {{pressure}} {{caused by the}} velocity of the steam and an expansion chamber is used to reduce this pressure. Experimenting established that the suction created by a petrol engine running on the gas actually increased the generation of the producer gas by drawing more steam and air through the burn.

40|$|Due to the {{pressure}} difference between the blade pressure and <b>suction</b> side, hot <b>gas</b> leaks through {{the gap between the}} blade tip and the shroud. This flow, called leakage flow, causes thin bound-ary layer and high heat transfer coefficient on the blade tip. The hot leakage flow is the major cause of blade tip failures. To reduce the leakage flow and heat transfer on the tip, the blades of modern gas turbines typically have a recessed cavity at the tip and are called squealer tip blades. The cavity acts as a labyrinth seal to increase flow resistance and thus reduces leakage flow. Recently, many experimental studies for the squealer tip blade have been conducted in a cascade environment. Azad et al...|$|R

40|$|A {{model for}} gas phase mixing in {{fluidized}} bed boiler furnaces is presented. The model takes its basis in {{a description of}} the dynamics of the dense bottom bed which strongly govern the gas mixing up through the furnace. Thus, a time-resolved approach is used to link the modeling to the physics of the underlying processes determining the gas mixing. As output, the model gives the fluctuating flux of gas species, in contrast to the classical modeling approach which is limited to time-averaged gas fluxes. Such a dynamical approach allows assumption of the volatile combustion system as transport-controlled which avoids complete consumption of either oxygen or combustible gases in each modeled cell. Thus, the time-resolved analysis employed enables application of a realistic criterion for the mixing such as that reactants can coincide in both space and time in order to react. While fitting of kinetics is strongly dependent on the system and operational conditions, the present model integrates key system variables such as the bottom bed height and the characteristic pressure-drop constant over the primary air distributor, allowing application of transport-controlled (i. e. infinitely fast kinetics) volatile combustion. The model of the bottom bed divides the gas flow into two phases, a throughflow and an emulsion gas, and calculates their respective fluctuations in velocity and composition. Having these, in-furnace gas probe measurements can be simulated and compared with in-situ <b>gas</b> <b>suction</b> probe measurements, i. e. the probe signal is modeled. Such an approach is crucial in fluidized bed-boilers furnaces since in-situ gas probe measurements in regions with high fluctuations in gas velocity lead to results which are biased towards reducing conditions. Model results, including simulation of the <b>gas</b> <b>suction</b> probe, are analyzed and compared with experimental data from the Chalmers 12 MWth CFB boiler and a good agreement is obtained...|$|R
40|$|Endotracheal tube (ETT) suction is {{the most}} {{frequently}} performed invasive procedure in ventilated newborn infants and is associated with adverse effects related to negative tracheal pressure. We aimed to measure <b>suction</b> catheter <b>gas</b> flow and intratracheal pressure during ETT suction of a test lung and develop a mathematical model to predict tracheal pressure from catheter and ETT dimensions and applied pressure. Tracheal pressure and catheter flow were recorded during suction of ETT sizes 2. 5 - 4. 0 mm connected to a test lung with catheters 5 - 8 French Gauge and applied pressures of 80 - 200 mm Hg. The fraction of applied pressure transmitted to the trachea was calculated for each combination, and data fitted to three nonlinear models for analysis. Tracheal pressure was directly proportional to applied pressure (r 2 = 0. 82 - 0. 99), and catheter flow fitted a turbulent flow model (R 2 = 0. 85 - 0. 96). With each ETT, increasing catheter size resulted in greater catheter flow (p < 0. 0001) and thus lower intratracheal pressure (p < 0. 0001). The fraction of applied pressure transmitted to the trachea was accurately modeled using ETT and catheter dimensions (R 2 = 0. 98 - 0. 99).
