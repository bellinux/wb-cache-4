50|$|Inspired by {{the example}} of Britain and France, Charles William also wanted to develop the {{industrial}} sector in his country. He {{did not realize that}} the requirements, entrepreneurs and a trained workforce, were missing completely. His attempts to create and preserve manufacturing industries by stimulation and protectionism, was bound to fail sooner or later. After this sobering experience, Charles William turned to education. As early as 1718, a state orphanage had been opened in Pforzheim. Charles William <b>started</b> <b>a</b> <b>machine</b> factory in which the workers were also educated. The activities and the circle of trusted people were gradually expanded, so that at its height the factory employed about 250 people. Ultimately the attempt failed, due to mismanagement and to its products not being competitively priced. Nevertheless, Charles William can be regarded as a pioneer {{on the cutting edge of}} the compulsory schooling.|$|R

50|$|A {{heartbeat}} protocol {{is generally}} used {{to negotiate and}} monitor {{the availability of a}} resource, such as a floating IP address. Typically when <b>a</b> heartbeat <b>starts</b> on <b>a</b> <b>machine,</b> it will perform an election process with other machines on the heartbeat network to determine which machine, if any, owns the resource. On heartbeat networks of more than two machines, it is important to take into account partitioning, where two halves of the network could be functioning but not able to communicate with each other. In a situation such as this, {{it is important that the}} resource is only owned by one machine, not one machine in each partition.|$|R
