50|$|This {{is perhaps}} the most common, and {{certainly}} most mature demilitarisation destruction technology available. The rotary kiln is an unlined rotary furnace originally designed to destroy small arms and bulk explosives. The kiln is made up of four 1.6 metre long, 1 metre outer diameter retort sections bolted together. The 6 to 8 cm thick walls of the kiln are designed to withstand small detonations. The kiln contains internal <b>spiral</b> <b>flights,</b> which move the waste in an auger-like fashion through the retort as the kiln rotates. The flights also provide charge separation for the in-process materials, and discourage sympathetic detonations and scattering of materials. The kiln is equipped with a variable speed drive, which allows varying rotation speeds and material residence time.|$|E
50|$|A few species, S. longipes, S. pallidihirturn, and S. tessellaturn, {{have been}} noted to exhibit {{behaviour}} strongly suggestive of hill-topping, with males maintaining downward-facing positions on trunks of Eucalyptus trees, at elevations above 900 metres. This behaviour {{is likely to be}} applicable to other species within the genus. Each species studied appeared to prefer certain times of day for hill-topping and selected their positions on tree trunks based on bark smoothness or roughness, degree of illumination by sunlight, and distance from the ground. Males are competitive for these positions and can be observed engaging with each other aggressively, approaching each other for face-offs, <b>spiral</b> <b>flights,</b> and simulated copulation. While males congregating at altitude were in abundance, females were infrequently spotted at hill-topping sites, and when present, did not exhibit any territorial behaviour and preferred locations near the substrate. Female absence may be due to females only visiting the congregation sites when ready to mate. Although the behaviour of males and females at elevation are considered to be for mating purposes, direct evidence of this is lacking and little is known of their courtship and mating rituals.|$|E

25|$|Moths {{frequently}} {{appear to}} circle artificial lights, although {{the reason for}} this behavior remains unknown. One hypothesis to explain this behavior is that moths use a technique of celestial navigation called transverse orientation. By maintaining a constant angular relationship to a bright celestial light, such as the moon, they can fly in a straight line. Celestial objects are so far away that, even after travelling great distances, the change in angle between the moth and the light source is negligible; further, the moon will always be in {{the upper part of the}} visual field, or on the horizon. When a moth encounters a much closer artificial light and uses it for navigation, the angle changes noticeably after only a short distance, in addition to being often below the horizon. The moth instinctively attempts to correct by turning toward the light, thereby causing airborne moths to come plummeting downward, and resulting in a <b>spiral</b> <b>flight</b> path that gets closer and closer to the light source.|$|R

25|$|At {{any time}} of the year, but {{especially}} when the rains commence, a male will spend hours calling from a conspicuous perch. A clear, somewhat variable, whistled phrase of three to five syllables is typical, which may be rendered as tseep-tseeoo, teeoo-teewee or chiwiki-chiwi. The song may be changed after each 20 or so repetitions. During some intermissions the wings are audibly fluttered in the few seconds between phrases. This results in a quick prrrrt or phrrrp rattle, and may lift the bird off its perch. The crest is also lifted during display. It may alternatively sing a rudimentary song consisting of whistles, tweets and trills (distinguishable as imitated calls), during short flights over the grass or during an upward <b>spiraling</b> <b>flight,</b> before it planes down. Race malbranti in particular, may sing during a straight and direct display flight and clap its wings above its back.

50|$|Foundresses need {{to leave}} the nest to gather prey, nest {{materials}} and water. When she does {{so there is a}} risk that conspecific females will depredate her brood. These females fly to a nest, pull out a single larva and return to their own nests to feed their own larva with it. Foundresses chase off attacking females by <b>spiral</b> <b>flight,</b> whereby two females fly in the air in a double helix pattern. Attendance on nests successfully deters attacking females. Foundresses use the loss of a larva as a cue to assess predation risk, and increase their defense efforts in response. When a larva is removed, lone foundresses increase the total time spent on the nest by decreasing time spent on each off nest activities, and increasing the time interval between consecutive activities. There is not a difference in the number of off nest activities. After 30 minutes following the removal of a larva, the time spent on the nest begins returning to the pre-removal level. After 60 minutes, time spent on the nest returns to pre- removal levels.|$|R

40|$|We {{analysed}} asymmetry in {{the wings}} of the speckled wood butterfly (Pararge aegeria) by measuring area, length and width of fore- and hindwings. The type of asymmetry is fluctuating except for fore- and hindwing area, and forewing width in males, where asymmetry is directional. The amount of asymmetry (variance of the left wing minus the right wing) is less in males than in females. Within males asymmetry was directional and less in pale, predominantly territorial males than in melanic, predominantly non-territorial males. Asymmetry was negatively related to growth rate within females, but not within males. Females grew faster than males, but had higher asymmetry, whereas the more asymmetrical melanic males grew more slowly than pale males. The differences in the type and amount of asymmetry between the sexes and colour classes suggest a relationship with sex-specific flight patterns such as the territorial <b>spiralling</b> <b>flight</b> of males. We hypothesize that slightly asymmetrical males turn faster, and therefore are superior in territorial disputes over more symmetrical or extremely asymmetrical males. This implies that sexual selection via male–male competition influences the type and amount of asymmetry. The existence of more extremely asymmetrical individuals in females, {{and to a lesser extent}} in non-territorial males, may indicate that there are costs in reducing asymmetry...|$|R

The underside of the wing serves as the surface of a rectenna designed to receive microwave energy at a power density of 700 watts per square meter and the wing has a planform area of 3634 square feet to absorb the required power at an optimum Mach number M = 0. 44. The aircraft utilizes a horizontal tail and a canard for longitudinal control and to enhance the structural rigidity of the twin fuselage configuration. The wing structure is designed to withstand a gust-induced load factor n = 3 at cruise altitude but the low-wing loading of the aircraft makes it very sensitive to gusts at low altitudes, which may induce load factors in excess of 20.

Kinematic, cloud physical, and radiometric observations from various instruments are used to estimate the different terms in the moisture- and heat-budget equations. The results show that the advection terms, estimated using the mean longitudinal wind and vertical velocities, and radiative fluxes are important in forming budgets for the cirrus layers. Ice-crystal growth is significant in the upper layers.

40|$|The ever {{increasing}} demands for energy world-wide has prompted research into {{and implementation of}} devices to harvest power from renewable sources of energy, such as hydroelectricity. Large-scale hydroelectric plants have existed for over a century, and are capable of producing over 10000 MW of power. However, such facilities are expensive and generally {{have a significant impact}} on the local ecosystem; as such, there are relatively few locations and communities that can support their construction. Small-scale hydroelectric facilities, which produce power up to 30 MW, are increasing in popularity since they do not divert the natural flow of the river and are capable of harnessing energy from smaller sources than their large-scale cousins one of the main concerns being the negative effects they can have on the local fauna. Specifically, fish inadvertently passing through the facility can be hurt or killed by the inlet guide vanes or rotor assembly through a variety of mechanisms, including striking the structure, being caught between rotating and stationary parts, or through dramatic changes in fluid pressure. In order to mitigate injury to fish passing through small-scale hydroelectric facilities, AlphaStar Hydro has developed a novel vaneless swirl injector to replace current inlet guide vane stages, which allows the fish to travel through with minimal damage, while still imparting the necessary swirl component onto the flow for proper turbine operation. This swirl injector is made up of a single <b>spiral</b> <b>flighting</b> wrapped around a central shaft. The main focus of this work is on quantifying and optimizing the flow through the vaneless swirl injector. Of primary concern is the axisymmetry of the flow exiting the injector, the pressure drop across it, and the swirl that it provides, all of which directly impact rotor performance. Based upon a preliminary patented design provided by AlphaStar Hydro, the flow field generated by the injector was determined through a computational fluid dynamics study. This provided the foundation for a geometric optimization study to maximize flow axisymmetry and swirl, while minimizing pressure loss. A 5 by 4 grid was setup using number of revolutions and pitch angle as variables. Four metrics were measured: axial axisymmetry, tangential axisymmetry, swirl number and pressure loss. Using the four metrics, an objective function was created and was subsequently optimized using a line search algorithm. The study concluded that the number of revolutions is not as important as the pitch angle and that the optimal geometry is 4 revolutions at a pitch angle of 25 degrees. A test rig was designed and constructed in order to test the newly optimized design with the addition of the nose cone. The setup is composed of a reservoir, a pump, a gate valve, a circle-to-rectangle transition, flow conditioning elements, the swirl injector, a test section and return plumbing. The rig was commissioned and initially characterized by measuring the velocity drift with time, the change in temperature with time, and the inlet velocity profile upstream of the injector. The experimental facility was coupled with numerical simulations to explore the flow field downstream of the optimized swirl injector with an attached nose cone, as would be the case upon rotor installation. The pressure, axial velocity and tangential velocity contours were analyzed to assess the performance of the swirl injector in its operational configuration, in preparation for rotor installation. A recirculation zone on the nose cone was observed, which was due to the flow separation on the nose cone. The swirl numbers and the axisymmetry metrics were compared between the optimization model and the nose cone model, revealing that there were no significant differences between the two. The experimentally measured velocity profiles were found to match well with the numerical profiles, as did the pressure distributions within the test section. This provided cross-validation of the experimental and numerical studies. The experimental data exhibited relatively high fluctuations in the velocity signals, however...|$|R

A mass resolution of 35, 000 (FWHM) for m/z greater than 300 was achieved. Even in a lower mass region, mass resolutions of more than 20, 000 (FWHM) were confirmed with a doublet of 12 C 51 H 514 N+ and 13 C 12 C 51 H 6 +. The mass accuracy was also improved such {{that it was better}} than 1 ppm with only one internal standard peak. An ion transmission of approximately of 100 % was observed for 15 cycles...|$|R
40|$|A novel MALDI-TOF mass {{spectrometer}} that utilizes a spiral ion trajectory was developed. In this {{mass spectrometer}}, the ions sequentially passed through four toroidal electrostatic sectors and revolved along a figure-eight-shaped orbit {{on a particular}} projection plane. Each toroidal electrostatic sector had eight stories, and during multiple revolutions, the ion trajectory shifted perpendicular to the projection plane in every cycle, thereby generating a <b>spiral</b> trajectory. The <b>flight</b> path length of one cycle was 2. 1 m; therefore, when the ions completed eight cycles, the total flight path length was 17 m. By adopting an ion optical system that had a flight path length five times longer than that in the commonly used reflectron ion optical system, the mass dependence on the mass resolving power was reduced, while improving the mass accuracy of the mass measurements. The basic performance of the system was tested by using standard peptides or the tryptic digest of bovine serum albumin. A mass resolving power of 80, 000 (full width at half maximum) was achieved at m/z = 2564 (ACTH 18 - 39). An improved mass accuracy less than 2 ppm was realized over a wide m/z range of 500 to 3000 by correction using one or two internal standard substances...|$|R
40|$|The {{vertical}} tail {{size of a}} multi-engine aircraft is typically driven by the directional control requirement during one-engine-inoperative flight. This results in the {{vertical tail}} being over-sized for most regularly occurring flight conditions. By adding thrust vectoring technology to an aircraft, the vertical tail can be designed to cope with regularly occurring flight conditions rather than the one-engine-inoperative flight condition. A modern aircraft was redesigned such {{that it would have}} thrust vectoring capabilities and an unconventionally small vertical tail. The redesigned vertical tails had areas which were 85 %, 70 %, 60 %, and 50 % of the original vertical tail area, which corresponded to reductions in the vertical tail area of 15 %, 30 %, 40 %, and 50 %, respectively. By reducing the vertical tail area, an aircraft's parasite drag may be reduced, and a reduction in parasite drag would allow for a reduction in the aircraft's fuel consumption. Analyses showed that the redesigned vertical tail and change in aircraft inertia due to the addition of thrust vectoring technology had a negligible impact of the aircraft's roll mode dynamics. It was also shown that the reduction in vertical tail area resulted in a degradation of the aircraft's <b>spiral</b> mode <b>flight</b> qualities. With regards to the Dutch roll motion, a reduction in vertical tail area resulted in a reduction of Dutch roll damping coefficient and Dutch roll frequency. Based on the analysis of the Dutch roll mode, it has been recommended that a compromise between the 85 % and 70 % vertical tail area would likely produce an acceptable compromise between the reduced vertical tail area and Dutch roll flight characteristics; however, the aircraft design would required a yaw damper. It is predicted that trimmed flight with one-engine-inoperative can be achieved by simultaneously using thrust vectoring technology and an unconventionally small vertical tail. Through the use of directional thrust vectoring, an aircraft's rudder deflection angle, aileron deflection angle, and bank angle may reduced during the one-engine-inoperative flight condition. Analysis of the one-engine-inoperative and crosswind flight condition shows that using thrust vectoring for directional control may allow for a reduction in trim drag; however, additional analysis of this flight condition should be completed. A vertical tail mass estimation was completed, and {{it has been shown that}} the reduction in vertical tail mass resulting from a reduction in vertical tail area is of the same magnitude when compared to the engine mass increase due to the addition of thrust vectoring technologies. Lastly, it has been shown that an aircraft's mission fuel consumption can be reduced if the aircraft's vertical tail area is reduced and thrust vectoring flight control is implemented into the aircraft design. Reductions in mission fuel consumption greater than 1 % are unlikely; however, there are feasible reductions in mission fuel mass for the proposed thrust vectoring aircraft design.
