5|$|Social <b>stratification</b> is the {{hierarchical}} arrangement of individuals into social classes, castes, and divisions within a society. Modern Western societies <b>stratification</b> traditionally relates to {{cultural and economic}} classes arranged in three main layers: upper class, middle class, and lower class, but each class may be further subdivided into smaller classes (e.g. occupational). Social <b>stratification</b> is interpreted in radically different ways within sociology. Proponents of structural functionalism suggest that, since the <b>stratification</b> of classes and castes is evident in all societies, hierarchy must be beneficial in stabilizing their existence. Conflict theorists, by contrast, critique the inaccessibility of resources and lack of social mobility in stratified societies.|$|E

40|$|Econometric {{analysis}} often addresses model misspecification {{due to the}} improper pooling of observations. One {{major problem}} in testing for improper pooling is the requirement that alternative <b>stratifications</b> be obtained from others through sets of restrictions (i. e., that they be nested <b>stratifications),</b> thus eliminating a large class of alternative non-nested <b>stratifications.</b> We propose that non-nested tests {{can be used to}} compare non-nested <b>stratifications.</b> We formally define the econometric problem, and show the applicability of the J, JA, Cox and non-nested F tests.

40|$|We define "t-stratifications", {{a strong}} notion of <b>stratifications</b> for Henselian valued fields K of equi-characteristic 0, and {{prove that they}} exist. In {{contrast}} to classical <b>stratifications</b> in Archimedean fields, t-stratifications also contain non-local information about the stratified sets. For example, they do not only see the singularities in the valued field, but also those in the residue field. Like Whitney <b>stratifications,</b> t-stratifications exist for different classes of subsets of K^n, e. g. algebraic subvarieties or certain classes of analytic subsets. The general framework are definable sets (in the sense of model theory) in a language that satisfies certain hypotheses. We give two applications. First, we show that t-stratifications in suitable valued fields K induce classical Whitney <b>stratifications</b> in R or C; in particular, the existence of t-stratifications implies the existence of Whitney <b>stratifications.</b> This uses methods of non-standard analysis. Second, we show how, using t-stratifications, one can determine the ultra-metric isometry type of definable subsets of Z_p^n for p sufficiently big. For those p, this proves a conjecture stated in a previous article. In particular, this yields a new, geometric proof of the rationality of Poincaré series.

40|$|We {{introduce}} tangent cones of subsets of cartesian {{powers of}} a real closed field, generalising {{the notion of the}} classical tangent cones of subsets of Euclidean space. We then study the impact of non-archimedean <b>stratifications</b> (t-stratifications) on these tangent cones. Our main result is that a t-stratification induces <b>stratifications</b> of the same nature on the tangent cones of a definable set. As a consequence, we show that the archimedean counterpart of a t-stratification induces Whitney <b>stratifications</b> on the tangent cones of a semi-algebraic set. The latter statement is achieved by working with the natural valuative structure of non-standard models of the real field. Comment: 15 page...|$|R

Sex and age are common examples of confounding variables. Moreover, it is also known that many genetic variations are associated with the geographical and historical populations in which the mutations first arose.

5|$|Karl Marx {{distinguished}} {{social classes}} by their {{connection to the}} means of production in the capitalist system: the bourgeoisie own the means, but this effectively includes the proletariat itself as the workers can only sell their own labour power (forming the material base of the cultural superstructure). Max Weber critiqued Marxist economic determinism, arguing that social <b>stratification</b> is not based purely on economic inequalities, but on other status and power differentials (e.g. patriarchy). According to Weber, <b>stratification</b> may occur among at least three complex variables: (1) Property (class): A person's economic position in a society, based on birth and individual achievement. Weber differs from Marx in that he does not see this as the supreme factor in <b>stratification.</b> Weber noted how managers of corporations or industries control firms they do not own; Marx would have placed such a person in the proletariat. (2) Prestige (status): A person's prestige, or popularity in a society. This could be determined by the kind of job this person does or wealth. and (3) Power (political party): A person's ability to get their way despite the resistance of others. For example, individuals in state jobs, such as an employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or a member of the United States Congress, may hold little property or status but they still hold immense power Pierre Bourdieu provides a modern example in the concepts of cultural and symbolic capital. Theorists such as Ralf Dahrendorf have noted the tendency towards an enlarged middle-class in modern Western societies, particularly in relation to the necessity of an educated work force in technological or service-based economies. Perspectives concerning globalization, such as dependency theory, suggest this effect owes to the shift of workers to the developing countries.|$|E

5|$|The {{amount of}} oxygen present in {{seawater}} depends primarily upon its temperature and the photosynthetic organisms living in it, particularly algae, phytoplankton, and {{plants such as}} seagrass. During the day, their photosynthetic activity produces oxygen, which dissolves into the seawater and is used by marine animals. The water's oxygen saturation is lower during the night and much lower in the deep sea. Below a depth of about , there is insufficient light for photosynthesis and consequently little dissolved oxygen. Below this, anaerobic bacteria break down falling organic material, producing hydrogen sulfide (H₂S). It is projected that global warming will reduce oxygen both in surface and deep waters, due to oxygen's decreased solubility as temperatures increase and increased oceanic <b>stratification.</b>|$|E
