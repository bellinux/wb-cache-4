2500|$|Finally, {{it remains}} {{unsettled}} {{whether or not}} the rebels’ overthrow of Gaddafi’s government following the fall of Tripoli in August 2011 changed the nature of the conflict again. Some academics believe that as the rebels were now the legitimate and effective government of the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>Libya,</b> the conflict was [...] "deinternationalised" [...] and thus non-international in nature again. Others maintain the opposite position, arguing that the available legal tests for [...] "deinternationalisation" [...] are unpersuasive and introduce vague and politicized criteria that cannot be satisfactorily considered {{in the heat of the}} battle. Consequently, these authors would consider that the international nature of the conflict remained unchanged until the end of hostilities.|$|E

According to a 2007 memo from Monitor to Libya's intelligence chief which was subsequently obtained by the National Conference for the Libyan Opposition and posted on the internet in 2009, Monitor entered into further contracts with the Libyan regime in 2006 which were worth at least $3m (£1.8m) per year plus expenses. According to the memo these contracts were for a campaign to [...] "enhance international understanding and appreciation <b>of</b> <b>Libya...</b> emphasize the emergence <b>of</b> the new <b>Libya...</b> and introduce Muammar Qadhafi as a thinker and intellectual."

50|$|The 1986 United <b>States</b> bombing <b>of</b> <b>Libya,</b> code-named Operation El Dorado Canyon, {{comprised}} {{air strikes}} by the United States against Libya on Tuesday, 15 April 1986.

There were 40 reported Libyan casualties, and one U.S. plane was shot down. One of the Libyan dead was a baby girl, who was reported to be Gaddafi's daughter, Hana Gaddafi. However, there were doubts as to whether she was really killed, or whether she really even existed.|$|R
50|$|This chapter {{describes}} the Reagan administration using Muammar Gaddafi as a pawn in their public relations (PR) strategy {{of creating a}} simplified, morally unambiguous foreign policy by blaming him for the 1985 Rome and Vienna airport attacks and the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing that killed US soldiers, both of which European security services attributed to Syrian intelligence agencies. Gaddafi is described as playing along {{for the sake of}} increasing his profile in the Arab world as a revolutionary. The 1986 United <b>States</b> bombing <b>of</b> <b>Libya,</b> 10 days after the disco bombing, is described as an operation carried out mainly for PR reasons, because attacking Syria would have been too risky.|$|R
50|$|An {{interpretation}} of Condition 4 could include a complete absence in any British-controlled media of {{any reference to}} the Libyan hostage situation for fear that any such reference might be construed by the Libyan authorities as a breach of Condition 4.
