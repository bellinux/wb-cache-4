5|$|The {{remains of}} the priory church are {{dominated}} by the eastern gable wall of the presbytery that still stands to its full height. Its great east window is {{regarded as one of}} the finest examples of late-13th-century church architecture. The design is so close to that of the eastern arm of Ripon Cathedral, which was built around the <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is thought to have been modelled on Ripon's design. The window's tracery has disappeared, as has its sill, but from the stubs and surviving fragments it can be deduced that it had seven major lights (the glazed openings in the window). At its centre was a great circle of tracery filled with trefoiled lights. The main gable of the east wall is flanked by massive buttresses capped with gables and octagonal pinnacles. A similar pair of pinnacles top the main gable, flanking a window of unusual design; a bracket projects from the lower lobe to support a statue (no longer present), possibly of the Virgin Mary, to whom the priory was dedicated.|$|E

500|$|The novel {{begins by}} recounting {{the time that}} has passed since the First World War: generations have come and gone, and {{technology}} continues to advance and spread from Europe and America {{over the rest of}} the world. Overpopulation has become a problem, and the leaders of industry have seized state power. Pacified by the improvement in material conditions, the masses of the cities raise no objection. At the <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> sees radical technological innovations, Europe suffers declining birth rates and experiences waves of mass migration from Africa. In an effort to maintain their rule, the ruling Senates of Europe agree to restrict the public's access to science and technology.

500|$|Paine's Quaker {{upbringing}} predisposed him to deistic {{thinking at}} the <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> positioned him firmly within {{the tradition of}} religious Dissent. Paine acknowledged that he was indebted to his Quaker background for his skepticism, but the Quakers' esteem for plain speaking, a value expressed both explicitly and implicitly in The Age of Reason, influenced his writing even more. As the historian E. P. Thompson has put it, Paine [...] "ridiculed {{the authority of the}} Bible with arguments which the collier or country girl could understand". His description of the story of the virgin birth of Jesus demystifies biblical language: it is [...] "an account of a young woman engaged to be married, and while under this engagement she is, to speak plain language, debauched by a ghost". Quaker conversion narratives also influenced the style of The Age of Reason; Davidson and Scheick argue that its [...] "introductory statement of purpose, a fervid sense of inward inspiration, a declared expression of conscience, and an evangelical intention to instruct others" [...] resemble the personal confessions of American Quakers.|$|E
500|$|The initial {{version of}} WinFax only worked on fax modems {{containing}} a specific chipset, {{and was only}} capable of sending faxes; it could not receive them. This was remedied with {{the launch of the}} WinFax PRO 2.0 product during the summer of 1991. One of the key factors that differentiated this version of WinFax from other fax software packages of the time was the deliberate attempt to make the program compatible with all fax/modems. Prior to the introduction of WinFax PRO 2.0, competitors concentrated primarily on building software that would only work with a single brand of fax/modem hardware. At the <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> launched its WinFax PRO 2.0 product, Delrina also announced an OEM version of the same product designed to be bundled with new fax/modems. Within a few months, eight modem manufacturers had agreed to bundle this OEM version (called [...] "WinFax LITE") of the program along with their own product. By the summer of the following year this number had grown to 50 OEM partnerships with various fax-modem and computer system manufacturers to bundle the [...] "LITE" [...] version of Delrina's WinFax software with their own products. By February 1993 this number had grown to over 100 OEM partnerships.|$|E

500|$|The {{news of the}} landsknechts' defeat reached Cardona's {{troops at}} about the <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had reached Enghien; the Imperial column turned and retreated back towards its {{original}} position. Enghien followed closely with {{the remainder of his}} cavalry; he was soon reinforced by a company of Italian mounted arquebusiers, which had been stationed at Racconigi and had started towards the battlefield after hearing the initial artillery exchange. These arquebusiers, dismounting to fire and then remounting, were able to harass the Imperial column sufficiently to slow its retreat. Meanwhile, the French and Swiss infantry of the center, having reached Ceresole, had turned about and returned to the battlefield; Montluc, who was with them, writes: When we heard at Ceresole that M. d'Enghien wanted us, both the Swiss and we Gascons turned toward him—I never saw two battalions form up so quick—we got into rank again actually as we ran along, side by side. [...] The enemy was going off at quick march, firing salvos of arquebuses, and keeping off our horse, when we saw them. [...] And when they descried us only 400 paces away, and our cavalry making ready to charge, they threw down their pikes and surrendered to the horsemen. You might see fifteen or twenty of them round a man-at-arms, pressing about him and asking for quarter, for fear of us of the infantry, who were wanting to cut all their throats. Perhaps as many as half of the Imperial infantry were killed as they were attempting to surrender; the remainder, about 3,150 men, were taken prisoner. A few, including the Baron of Seisneck, who had commanded the German infantry contingents, managed to escape.|$|E

2500|$|TCSA {{initially}} {{reported an}} increase of at least 30% in its revenue following the reorganization, thanks to its near-monopoly on serving busy Avenida Pedro Montt. However, the situation turned around quickly after complaints from merchants along the street convinced the transportation ministry to permit the return to Avenida Montt of 16 bus routes run by other companies only three weeks later. The trolleybus company's revenue dropped sharply, and it discontinued Sunday service in April 2007. [...] Faced with this unexpected loss of revenue at the <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had just incurred the expenses of having to repaint its fleet (to meet the TMV requirements) and expand service (to a second route), the company announced in May that the trolleybus system would close in mid-June. [...] The unexpected news upset many citizens, as the vintage trolleybuses, designated a national historic monument in 2003, had become a cherished local icon. [...] Even Chilean president Michelle Bachelet voiced her support, telling regional transportation minister René Cortázar, [...] "The trolleys can't stop running in Valparaíso", while at a luncheon with Valparaíso's mayor. [...] Negotiations between TCSA and government officials led to agreements that averted the planned closure. [...] Service continued relatively unchanged on the system's longtime Avenida Colón route (802), but the recently revived Avenida Pedro Montt service (route 801) was discontinued once again, on or around 1 September 2007.|$|E
