5|$|<b>Supportive</b> <b>therapy</b> and diaphragmatic {{breathing}} has shown to cause improvement in 56% of cases, and total cessation of symptoms in an additional 30% {{in one study}} of 54 adolescent patients who were followed up 10 months after initial treatments. Patients who successfully use the technique often notice an immediate change in health for the better. Individuals who have had bulimia or who intentionally induced vomiting {{in the past have}} a reduced chance for improvement due to the reinforced behavior. The technique is not used with infants or young children due to the complex timing and concentration required for it to be successful. Most infants grow out of the disorder within a year or with aversive training.|$|E
5|$|Treatments are varied {{because there}} are {{multiple}} perspectives of alcoholism. Those who approach alcoholism as a medical condition or disease recommend differing treatments from, for instance, those who approach the condition as one of social choice. Most treatments focus on helping people discontinue their alcohol intake, followed up with life training and/or social support to help them resist a return to alcohol use. Since alcoholism involves multiple factors which encourage a person to continue drinking, they must all be addressed to successfully prevent a relapse. An example {{of this kind of}} treatment is detoxification followed by a combination of <b>supportive</b> <b>therapy,</b> attendance at self-help groups, and ongoing development of coping mechanisms. The treatment community for alcoholism typically supports an abstinence-based zero tolerance approach; however, some prefer a harm-reduction approach.|$|E

25|$|There has {{traditionally}} been skepticism about the psychological treatment of personality disorders, but several specific types of psychotherapy for BPD have developed in recent years. There is growing evidence {{for the role of}} psychotherapy in the treatment of people with BPD, with indications that both comprehensive and non-comprehensive psychotherapeutic interventions may have a beneficial effect. <b>Supportive</b> <b>therapy</b> alone may enhance self-esteem and mobilize the existing strengths of individuals with BPD. Specific psychotherapies may involve sessions over several months or, as is particularly common for personality disorders, several years. Psychotherapy can often be conducted either with individuals or with groups. Group therapy can aid the learning and practice of interpersonal skills and self-awareness by individuals with BPD, though drop-out rates may be problematic.|$|E
500|$|Following {{decontamination}} and {{the institution}} of supportive measures, the next priority is inhibition of further ethylene glycol metabolism using antidotes. The antidotes for ethylene glycol poisoning are ethanol and fomepizole. This antidotal treatment forms the mainstay of management of ethylene glycol poisoning. [...] The toxicity of ethylene glycol comes from its metabolism to glycolic acid and oxalic acid. [...] The goal of pharmacotherapy is to prevent the formation of these metabolites. [...] Ethanol acts by competing with ethylene glycol for alcohol dehydrogenase, the first enzyme in the degradation pathway. [...] Because ethanol has a much higher affinity for alcohol dehydrogenase, about a 100-times greater affinity, it successfully blocks the breakdown of ethylene glycol into glycolaldehyde, which prevents the further degradation. [...] Without oxalic acid formation, the nephrotoxic effects can be avoided, but the ethylene glycol is still present in the body. [...] It is eventually excreted in the urine, but <b>supportive</b> <b>therapy</b> for the CNS depression and metabolic acidosis will be required until the ethylene glycol concentrations fall below toxic limits. [...] Pharmaceutical grade ethanol is usually given intravenously as a 5 or 10% solution in 5% dextrose, {{but it is also}} sometimes given orally {{in the form of a}} strong spirit such as whisky, vodka, or gin.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Despite {{numerous}} investigations, {{the question}} whether all bona fide treatments of depression are equally efficacious in adults has not been sufficiently answered. Method: We applied two different meta-analytical techniques (conventional meta-analysis and mixed treatment comparisons). Overall, 53 studies with 3, 965 patients, which directly compared two or more bona fide psychotherapies in a randomized trial, were included. Meta-analyses were conducted regarding five different types of outcome measures. Additionally, the influence of possible moderators was examined. Results: Direct comparisons of cognitive behavior therapy, behavior activation therapy, psychodynamic therapy, interpersonal <b>therapy,</b> and <b>supportive</b> <b>therapies</b> versus all other respective treatments indicated {{that at the end}} of treatment all treatments but <b>supportive</b> <b>therapies</b> were equally efficacious whereas there was some evidence that <b>supportive</b> <b>therapies</b> were somewhat less efficacious than all other treatments according to patient self-ratings and clinical significance. At follow-up no significant differences were present. Age, gender, comorbid mental disorders, and length of therapy session were found to moderate efficacy. Cognitive behavior therapy was superior in studies where therapy sessions lasted 90 minutes or longer, behavior activation therapy was more efficacious when therapy sessions lasted less than 90 minutes. Mixed treatment comparisons indicated no statistically significant differences in treatment efficacy but some interesting trends. Conclusions: This study suggests that there might be differential effects of bona fide psychotherapies which should be examined in detail...|$|R

2500|$|Signs of {{vestibular}} disease include head tilt, circling, nystagmus (an {{abnormal movement}} of the eyes), and difficulty or inability to stand. These clinical signs {{are similar to those}} seen in humans experiencing vertigo. [...] Vestibular disease may have many causes. Elderly dogs are susceptible to an idiopathic (meaning due to unknown causes) form of vestibular disease commonly called [...] "old dog vestibular disease" [...] or idiopathic peripheral vestibular disease. The signs may improve rapidly or take a few days. Less commonly, vestibular signs can also be caused by inner ear disease, a brain tumor, a stroke, or other causes. The major risk with idiopathic peripheral vestibular disease is that the dog is often unable to eat, drink, or go outside to urinate or defecate. [...] These cases must receive <b>supportive</b> <b>therapy</b> of intravenous fluids and nutrition; a light sedative is sometimes administered, as the dog may be very stressed by the experience.|$|E
2500|$|Transference-focused {{psychotherapy}} (TFP) {{is a form}} of {{psychoanalytic therapy}} dating to the 1960s, rooted in the conceptions of Otto Kernberg on BPD and its underlying structure (borderline personality organization). Unlike in the case of traditional psychoanalysis, the therapist plays a very active role in TFP. In session the therapist works on the relationship between the patient and the therapist. The main focus is on the patient's emotions concerning their relationship with the therapist and the therapist's use of psychodynamic techniques (e.g., interpretation). The therapist will try to explore and clarify aspects of this relationship so the underlying object relations dyads become clear. Some limited research on TFP suggests it may reduce some symptoms of BPD by affecting certain underlying processes, and that TFP in comparison to dialectical behavioral therapy and <b>supportive</b> <b>therapy</b> results in increased reflective functioning (the ability to realistically think about how others think) and a more secure attachment style. [...] Furthermore, TFP {{has been shown to be}} as effective as DBT in improvement of suicidal behavior, and has been more effective than DBT in alleviating anger and in reducing verbal or direct assaultive behavior. Limited research suggests that TFP appears to be less effective than schema-focused therapy, while being more effective than no treatment.|$|E

One {{of the more}} optimal treatments which is highly needed is the assertive <b>supportive</b> group <b>therapy</b> by using the approach of King’s model of nursing interaction, in which the patient together with his group is asked to give support to do the assertive behavior to each other. The study was purposed to analyze the effects of assertive <b>supportive</b> group <b>therapy</b> on violent behavior done by the Schizophrenic patients based on the King’s interaction nursing model. Method : The design {{of this study was}} the pre-post test control group. The population involved the patients with violent behavior hospitalized in the in-patient ward of RSJ Menur Surabaya. The samples of 20 respondents were taken by using simple random sampling technique. The independent variable was the assertive <b>supportive</b> group <b>therapy,</b> whereas the dependent one was violent behavior. Furthermore, the data were collected by filling out the observation sheet. The data were processed by using Paired T-test, Wilcoxon’s Signed Rank Test, and Mann-Whitney’s statistic test. Result : The result of study showed that before receiving this therapy, the average value of violent behavior in the treatment group was 96. 1, whereas the average value found in the control group was 75. 1. After receiving the assertive <b>supportive</b> group <b>therapy,</b> the average value of violent behavior in the treatment group was 58. 4, whereas the average value found in the control group was 54. 8. Moreover, the result of statistic test in the treatment group showed that the value difference of violent behavior before and after the treatment was p = 0. 005, whereas the value difference found in the control group was p = 0. 000, and the effects of the assertive <b>supportive</b> group <b>therapy</b> on violent behavior was p = 0. 045. Discussion : The assertive <b>supportive</b> group <b>therapy</b> with King’s model of nursing interaction could decrease the patient’s violent behavior by optimizing the personal system and interpersonally giving support to one another within the group.
