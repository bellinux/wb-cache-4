The British dismounted the guns, burnt five <b>settees</b> and brought out another five <b>settees</b> or tartans laden with wine and wheat. One tartan, the Velon Maria, was a letter of marque, armed with one brass and two iron 12-pounders and two 3-pounders. She had a crew of 14 men.|$|E

25|$|In {{the month}} between 19 July and 20 August, Mermaid {{captured}} ten vessels, five {{of which she}} burnt or scuttled. Four were the French <b>settee</b> Bien Venue, which had been sailing from Fréjus to Marseilles with deals (long wooden planks), the French <b>settee</b> San Antonio, which was sailing from Oneglia to La Silva with a cargo of snuff, the French <b>settee</b> Saint Pierre, which was sailing from Bandol to Marseilles with firewood, and an unnamed Spanish <b>settee</b> carrying barilla. Mermaid ran one French <b>settee,</b> which was carrying wheat, ashore and scuttled her too. The three vessels Mermaid kept were the Spanish sloop Saint Juan Baptiste, which was sailing from Cette to Genoa with wine, an unnamed Spanish <b>settee</b> carrying barilla, the French <b>settee</b> Sainte Barbe, which was sailing from Marseilles with wheat, the French ketch Notre dame de la Providence, which was sailing from Marseilles to Genoa with wine and flour, and the Genoese <b>settee</b> Conception, which was sailing from Bandol to Genoa with wine.|$|R

At night, these seats can usually be used as beds. Because the ideal {{ergonomic}} distance between a seat-back and its front edge (back of the knee) makes for a rather narrow bed, good <b>settee</b> berths will have a system for moving the back of the <b>settee</b> out of the way; this can reveal a surprisingly wide bunk, often running right out to the hull side underneath the lockers. If they are to be used at sea, <b>settee</b> berths must have lee-cloths to prevent the user falling out of bed. Sometimes the <b>settee</b> forms part of a double bed for use in harbour, often using detachable pieces of the table and extra cushions. Such beds are not usually referred to as <b>settee</b> berths.|$|R
25|$|Mexico was a {{crossroads}} of {{trade in the}} colonial period, with goods from Asia and Europe mixing with those natively produced. This convergence is most evident in the decorative arts of New Spain. It was popular among the upper classes to have a main public room, called a salon de estrado, to be covered in rugs and cushions for women to recline in Moorish fashion. Stools and later chairs and <b>settees</b> were added for men. Folding screens were introduced from Japan, with Mexican-style ones produced called biombos The earliest of these Mexican made screens had oriental designs but later ones had European and Mexican themes. One {{example of this is}} a screen with the conquest of Mexico one side and an aerial view of Mexico City on the other at the Franz Mayer Museum.|$|E
25|$|On 4 April 1810, while off Falerna, Ayscough {{observed}} two 100-ton <b>settees</b> being {{loaded on}} the beach. He immediately sent the ship's boats {{under the command}} of Lieutenant George Sartorius, accompanied by the boats of , {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Robert Oliver. Unfortunately three of the boats were swamped close to shore when they struck a hidden reef, and two men from Espoir were lost. The rest of the men swam ashore, but their powder now being wet, were only armed with cutlasses. The British came under fire from two long 6-pounders concealed behind some rocks, but nevertheless drove off the enemy, spiked the guns and set the ships on fire, before righting their boats and returning to the ships for the loss of only two men killed. Later, on 20 April, two sloops were captured and scuttled off Ischia.|$|E
25|$|On 22 June 1810 Ortenzia was off {{the coast}} of Calabria. When , Commander John Toup Nicholas, arrived, Blaquiere {{informed}} Toup that a French convoy of 51 vessels were anchored off Cirella, a small town some 30 miles south of the Gulf of Policastro. The next day Pilot and Ortenzia came up under sweeps, the wind being calm, and observed that the convoy was under the escort of five <b>settees</b> and eight gunboats. Ortensia, assisted by boats from Pilot chased the convoy, firing on it. The British succeeded in causing five of the largest merchant vessels to run ashore north of the town and some of the others to seek refuge under a battery. However, the arrival of more escorts and the tiredness of the British sailors, who had been at the sweeps for nine hours, led Toup to call off the attack. In the evening Pilots boats tried to destroy the vessels on the beach, but heavy small arms fire drove them off. Pilot and Ortenzia then destroyed the vessels with gunfire. British casualties included three men killed.|$|E

500|$|Sir John Louis was {{appointed}} captain in October 1811 and took Aigle to the Mediterranean. Aigle and [...] used boats to land marines and seamen near the harbour of Campo del Porto, Elba, on 20 June 1813. When the batteries protecting the town were over-run and the troops there routed, the French scuttled {{three of their}} own ships {{to prevent them from}} becoming prizes. The following morning, having returned to the boats, the marines captured a small convoy of three <b>settees</b> and drove the brig protecting them into Portoferraio. Two large feluccas were taken from the town of Mesca in the Gulf of Spezia, on the 28 June. Prevented by the wind from using the ships, the British once more took to boats but only succeeded in driving their quarry inshore. Later that evening the wind changed direction and Aigle and Curacoa were able to bombard the town while marines took the feluccas from the beach.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{significant}} {{pieces of}} antique furniture were acquired {{and placed in}} the room by du Pont. Among these were card tables, [...] "Martha Washington" [...] chairs, a secretary (by Baltimore furniture maker Joseph Burgess), side chairs, a sofa (formerly owned by Daniel Webster), <b>settees</b> (from Massachusetts), urn stands, and work tables. Many items of furniture were reupholstered in white. Du Pont chose a white cotton with delicate embroidered vines in green and gold for the Massachusetts <b>settees,</b> and an ivory silk with multicolored flowers for the Webster sofa. The various chairs were covered in either a white damask with a medallion pattern, a green-on-white silk brocade (inspired by Robert Adam), or a buff, green, or gold silk of contemporary design and weave. With the new window and wall upholstery in place by early 1963, Boudin suggested upholstering all the furniture in the room in green. But for reasons which are unclear, he only changed one item, a Louis XVI-style armchair acquired in 1963. It was covered in a leather the same shade of green as the walls.|$|E

Instead of the heavy, masculine overtones then pervasive in fashionable interiors, Elsie used light fabric for window coverings, painted walls pale colors, tiled the floors, and added wicker chairs and <b>settees.</b> [...] The effect centered on the illusion of an outdoor garden pavilion.

[...] The 37R hull is built with fibre-reinforced plastic using DuPont hybrid material that combines Kevlar with fiberglass. This combined with C's usual balsa core results in a very high strength or stiffness to weight ratio. Unidirectional glass is used for additional local stiffening. Its interior, rather than being based upon moulded pans and liners of the cruiser/racer 37/40+, is organized around a series of plywood longitudinals and bulkheads. These plywood members are rigidly glassed to the hull and contribute considerably to the strength and stiffness of the hull. The massive aluminum chainplates are bolted to sturdy plywood webs which form the back of the <b>settees.</b> The aft cabin was usually not enclosed on the standard 37R but an enclosed aft cabin was an option, as were other cruising amenities found standard on the 37+, such as hot and cold pressure water and 110 volt shore power.|$|E
