50|$|The {{provisions}} of the Lateran Council had less effect on monastic churches and cathedrals in England; as these would have already been fitted with two transverse screens; a pulpitum screen separating off the ritual choir; and an additional rood screen one bay further west, delineating {{the area of the}} nave provided for lay worship (or in monastic churches of the Cistercian order, delineating the distinct church area reserved for the worship of lay brothers). The monastic rood screen invariably had a nave altar set against its western face, which, from at least the late 11th century onwards, was commonly dedicated to the Holy Cross; as for example in Norwich Cathedral, and in Castle Acre Priory. In the later medieval period many monastic churches erected an additional transverse parclose screen, or fence screen, {{to the west of the}} nave altar; an example of which survives as the chancel screen in Dunstable Priory. Hence the Rites of Durham, a detailed account of the liturgical arrangements of Durham Cathedral Priory before the Reformation, describes three transverse screens; fence screen, rood screen and pulpitum. and the triple same arrangement is also documented in the collegiate church of Ottery St Mary. In the rest of Europe, this multiple <b>screen</b> <b>arrangement</b> was only found in Cistercian churches, as at Maulbronn. but many other major churches, such as Albi Cathedral, inserted transverse screens in the later medieval period, or reconstructed existing choir screens on a greatly increased scale. In Italy, massive rood screens incorporating an ambo or pulpit facing the nave appear to have been universal in the churches of friars; but not in parish churches, there being no equivalent in the Roman Missal for the ritual elaborations of the Use of Sarum.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} occlusion-free animation of geographical landmarks, and its application to {{a new type of}} car navigation system in which driving routes of interest are always visible. This is achieved by animating a nonperspective image where geographical landmarks such as mountain tops and roads are rendered as if they are seen from different viewpoints. The technical contribution of this paper lies in formulating the nonperspective terrain navigation as an inverse problem of continuously deforming a 3 D terrain surface from the 2 D <b>screen</b> <b>arrangement</b> of its associated geographical landmarks. The present approach provides a perceptually reasonable compromise between the navigation clarity and visual realism where the corresponding nonperspective view is fully augmented by assigning appropriate textures and shading effects to the terrain surface according to its geometry. An eye tracking experiment is conducted to prove that the present approach actually exhibits visually-pleasing navigation frames while users can clearly recognize the shape of the driving route without occlusion, together with the spatial configuration of geographical landmarks in its neighborhood.

40|$|An {{experimental}} investigation at low airspeeds {{was made}} of the filling effect observed when a screen or similar resistance is placed across a diffuser. The filling effect is found to be real in that screens can prevent separation or restore separated flow in diffusers even of extreme divergence and to depend principally on screen location and pressure-drop coefficient of the screen. Results are given for three different diffusers of circular cross section with a variety of <b>screen</b> <b>arrangements.</b> Effects of single screens and multiple screens are shown.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effectiveness of screens as energy dissipaters in small hydraulic structures using physical experiments. In the experimental design, the Froude number, <b>screen</b> <b>arrangements,</b> and <b>screen</b> porosity were the major controlling parameters. The experiments covered a range of Froude numbers between 2. 5 and 8. 5, screen porosity of 40 % and 50 %, and gaps of double screens between 1 and 5 cm. The main goal {{of this study was}} investigation of the screens creating submerged hydraulic jumps. The flow depth was digitally measured in order to perceive the turbulences and validate the results of energy dissipation against those of the methods in the literature. The experimental results show the importance of each parameter on the screen performance. The <b>screens</b> with double <b>arrangement</b> with the imposed hydraulic jump dissipated more energy. The gaps of the double arrangement had an insignificant effect on energy dissipation. The double screen with porosity of 40 % had the best performance. Since the Froude number was found to be the most effective parameter, quadratic equations as a function of this number were fitted to the experimental results with high R 2 and very low RMSE values.

The acquisition and display methods described here combine high-resolution photography with surround vision and full stereo view in an immersive environment. This combination provides photographic stereo-panoramas {{for a variety of}} VR displays, including the StarCAVE, NexCAVE, and CORNEA. The zero parallax point used in conventional panorama photography is also the center of horizontal and vertical rotation when creating photographs for stereo panoramas. The two photographically created images are displayed on a cylinder or a sphere. The radius from the viewer to the image is set at approximately 20 feet, or at the object of major interest. A full stereo view is presented in all directions. The interocular distance, as seen from the viewer's perspective, displaces the two spherical images horizontally. This presents correct stereo separation in whatever direction the viewer is looking, even up and down. Objects at infinity will move with the viewer, contributing to an immersive experience. Stereo panoramas created with this acquisition and display technique can be applied without modification to a large array of VR devices having different <b>screen</b> <b>arrangements</b> and different VR libraries...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. 3 -D {{stereoscopic}} PIV {{is capable}} of measuring 3 -dimensional velocity components. It involves a very sophisticated routine during setup, calibration, measurement and data processing phases. This paper aims to verify the 3 -D stereoscopic PIV measurement procedures and {{to prove that the}} flow entering the diffuser is a fully developed flow. A diffuser inlet of rectangular cross-section, 130 mm x 50 mm is presently considered. For verification, the velocities from PIV are compared with the velocities from pitot static probe and theory. The mean velocity obtained using pitot static probe is 2. 44 m/s, whereas using PIV is 2. 46 m/s. It thus gives the discrepancy of 0. 8 %. There is also a good agreement between the mean velocity measured by PIV and theoretical value with the discrepancy of 1. 2 %. This minor discrepancy is mainly due to uncertainties in the experiments such as imperfect matching of coordinates between the probe and laser sheet, unsteadiness of flow, variation in density and less precision in calibration. Basically, the operating procedures of 3 -D stereoscopic PIV have successfully been verified. Nevertheless, the flow entering diffuser is not perfectly developed due to the imperfect joining duct and the abrupt change of inlet cross-section introduced. Therefore, improvement to the existing rig is proposed by means of installing settling chamber with multiple <b>screens</b> <b>arrangement</b> and contraction cone...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} dynamic coupled model of {{reactive}} sputtering suited for description of real in-line processing. In our model we divide the complex volume of a processing chamber into simple cells, e. g. parallelepipeds. For each cell the gettering kinetics of reactive gas at metalized surfaces {{as well as}} the sputtering kinetics of the target are calculated using a Runge-Kutta time step method. The inert and reactive gas flow is obtained via flow conductances defined for each connection between adjacent cells. For deposition of sputtered particles on chamber and substrate surfaces, a pressure dependent distribution matrix is used, which is obtained from singleparticle Monte Carlo calculations. The flow conductances for different pressure conditons are calculated using the well known "Direct Simulation Monte Carlo" method implemented on a Linux cluster, where for each volume cell an individual calculation task can be spawned. Tuned with flow conductances and particle distribution factors from Monte Carlo calculations our coupled model is capable of describing real in-line sputtering processes on a single-processor PC at almost real time speed. We present computer aided investigations on (i) the optimization of rate and homogeneity in the reactive sputter process using different target <b>screening</b> <b>arrangements</b> and (ii) the influence of substrate movement during reactive sputtering in transition mode.

Method The information reported is from a national study of care management arrangements, funded by the Department of Health. A response rate of 77 per cent was obtained from local authority social services departments. Results In old age mental health services over half of the respondents reported joint <b>screening</b> <b>arrangements</b> for health and social care, almost four-fifths reported both joint criteria for the allocation of key workers and a clear definition of monitoring responsibilities. Of the latter over two-fifths were reported as being the same in care management and the CPA. Forty-six per cent of respondents provided a specialist service for people with dementia. Three-fifths of respondents reported that they did not apply CPA to people with dementia who were in receipt of care management or did so in less than 20 per cent of cases. Where the CPA was applied it was more likely that a priority would be accorded to care management. A quarter of respondents reported the shared use of assessment documentation for people with dementia. Discussion The findings are set in the context of service developments to date and the implementation of the two systems of community based coordinated care for older people with mental health problems. Inter-authority variations are noted and the potential for greater service integration within the current legislative framework assessed. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{basic design}} {{considerations}} for perspective Air Traffic Control displays are described. A software framework {{has been developed}} for manual viewing parameter setting (MVPS) in preparation for continued, ongoing developments on automated viewing parameter setting (AVPS) schemes. The MVPS system is based on indirect manipulation of the viewing parameters. Requests for changes in viewing parameter setting are entered manually by the operator by moving viewing parameter manipulation pointers on the screen. The motion of these pointers, which {{are an integral part}} of the 3 -D scene, is limited to the boundaries of <b>screen.</b> This <b>arrangement</b> has been chosen, in order to preserve the correspondence between the new and the old viewing parameter setting, a feature which contributes to preventing spatial disorientation of the operator. For all viewing operations, e. g. rotation, translation and ranging, the actual change is executed automatically by the system, through gradual transitions with an exponentially damped, sinusoidal velocity profile, in this work referred to as 'slewing' motions. The slewing functions, which eliminate discontinuities in the viewing parameter changes, are designed primarily for enhancing the operator's impression that he, or she, is dealing with an actually existing physical system, rather than an abstract computer generated scene. Current, ongoing efforts deal with the development of automated viewing parameter setting schemes. These schemes employ an optimization strategy, aimed at identifying the best possible vantage point, from which the Air Traffic Control scene can be viewed, for a given traffic situation...|$|R
50|$|Until the 6th {{century the}} altar of Christian churches {{would have been in}} full view of the congregation, {{separated}} only by a low altar rail around it. Large churches had a ciborium, or canopy on four columns, over the altar, from which hung altar curtains which were closed at certain points in the liturgy. Then however, following the example of the church of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, churches began to surround their altars with a colonnade or templon which supported a decorated architrave beam along which a curtain could be drawn to veil the altar at specific points in the consecration of the Eucharist; and this altar screen, with widely spaced columns, subsequently became standard in the major churches of Rome. In Rome the ritual choir tended to be located west of the altar screen, and this choir area was also surrounded by cancelli, or low chancel <b>screens.</b> These <b>arrangements</b> still survive in the Roman basilicas of San Clemente and Santa Maria in Cosmedin, as well as St Mark's Basilica in Venice. In the Eastern Church, the templon and its associated curtains and decorations evolved into the modern iconostasis. In the Western Church, the cancelli screens of the ritual choir developed into the choir stalls and pulpitum screen of major cathedral and monastic churches; but the colonnaded altar screen was superseded from the 10th century onwards, when the practice developed of raising a canopy or baldacchino, carrying veiling curtains, over the altar itself.|$|R

40|$|A novel {{continuous}} small-scale reactor {{based on}} the oscillatory flow technology (Harvey et al 2001) is being developed for application to specialist chemical manufacture and high throughput continuous screening (Harvey et al 2003). This novel reactor is able to perform continuous multiphase reactions, including those involving the suspension of catalyst beads. Extensive potential use in chemistry, biological and pharmaceutical laboratories is envisaged. Optimum operation conditions for applications in the bioengineering field depend on at least four parameters: 1) fluid mixing, 2) residence time characteristics, 3) particle suspension and 4) (oxygen) mass transfer rates. This work particularly concerns {{the establishment of the}} operation conditions in relation to oxygen mass transfer rates, KL. a. Furthermore, KL. a values are correlated with the fluid mixing, axial dispersion coefficients and finally with the fluid mechanics observed experimentally by particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique and numerically simulated using Fluent® software. The screening reactor is composed of a 35 cm length glass jacketed tubes (Figure 1), provided with smooth periodic constrictions (SPCs). The internal diameter of the tube is 4. 4 mm. The diameter in the constricted zone (the baffle internal diameter) is about 1. 6 mm, representing an 87 % reduction in the cross-sectional area. Mixing intensity is controlled by setting up the frequency and the amplitude (centre-to-peak) of the fluid oscillations. Typical oscillation frequencies and amplitudes are from 0 to 20 Hz and from 0 to 4 mm, respectively. A <b>screening</b> <b>arrangement</b> based on some SPC tubes (say 10 to 20) placed at different configurations (serial or parallel) makes this novel reactor suitable for parallel processing and/or for sequential reactions procedures. State-of-the-art fibre-optical technology was used for on-line monitoring of the oxygen concentration inside the screening reactor by using a special fibre optical micro-probe. The working tip of the probe was dip-coated with a ruthenium complex immobilised in a sol-gel matrix. This complex was excited to fluorescence by a blue led (≈ 470 nm output peak) and the level of such fluorescence is inversely related with the concentration of the oxygen through the Stern-Volmer equation (Wang et al., 1999). Continuous fluorescence levels are accurately measured by an UV/VIS/NIR multi-channel spectrometer. Numerical simulations by the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique, using Fluent ® software, permitted us to conclude that either near plug flow or stirred tank behaviour can be approached in a single SPC tube, by controlling the fluid oscillation conditions, i. e. the oscillation frequency and/or amplitude. For oscillatory Reynolds numbers (Reo) between 10 and 100, the formation of axisymmetric vortex rings leads to a good radial mixing of the fluid and to low axial dispersions, which suggests that a performance near a plug flow reactor is achieved. For Reo above 100 the high intensity and asymmetry of the vortex rings leads to an increase of the axial dispersion and the fluid behaviour approach that of a stirred tank. All these results were experimentally validated by PIV observations. High radial rates of flow exchange were numerically simulated and experimentally observed during a complete oscillation cycle, coupled {{with a high degree of}} velocity gradients. Thus, enhancements of heat and mass transfer rates are expectable within this novel screening reactor. Further, an increase of bubbles breakage is also expected (leading to a decrease of bubble diameter, i. e. an increase of the specific bubble area, a, and also of the gas hold-up), conducting to a significant improvement of oxygen mass transfer. This will be demonstrated with the present work...|$|R
40|$|The {{landscape}} of television is changing. Modern Internet enabled sets are now capable computing devices offering {{new forms of}} connectivity and interaction to viewers. One development enabled by this transition is the distribution of auxiliary content to a portable computing device, such as a mobile phone or tablet, working {{in concert with the}} television. These configurations are enabled by second screen applications that provide relevant content in synchronisation with the programme on a nearby television set. This thesis extends the notion of second <b>screen</b> to <b>arrangements</b> that incorporate multiple mobile devices working with the television, utilised by collocated groups of participants. Herein these arrangements are referred to as ‘many-screen’ television. Two many-screen applications were developed for the augmentation of sports programming in preparation of this thesis; the Olympic Companion and MarathOn Multiscreen Applications. Both of these applications were informed by background literature on second screen television and wider issues in HCI multiscreen research. In addition, the design of both applications was inspired by the needs of traditional and online broadcasters, through an internship with BBC Research and Development and involvement in a YouTube sponsored project. Both the applications were evaluated by collocated groups of users in formative user studies. These studies centred on how users share and organise what to watch, incorporate activity within the traditionally passive television viewing experience and the integration of user-generated video content in a many-screen system. The primary contribution of this thesis is a series of industry validated guidelines for the design of many-screen applications. The guidelines highlight issues around user awareness devices, content and other user’s actions, the balance between communal and private viewing and the appropriation of user-generated content in many-screen watching...|$|R

While this is appropriate, as Baldessin’s art is intimately involved with his relationship to ‘place’, extensive biographical interpretations have meant that the consequences of Baldessin’s life have long overshadowed {{the consequences of his}} art. After travelling to Milan in 1962 to study with the internationally renowned Marino Marini, Baldessin found himself under the tutelage of Marini’s lesser-known studio assistant, Alik Cavaliere (1926 - 1998). Cavaliere’s phenomenological philosophy, which informed his approach to sculpture, formed a foundational basis for Baldessin’s later work in Australia. After his return from Milan, the young artist created works that were derivative of Cavaliere. This was contemporary Milanese art, Melbourne style. Over time this influence became less obvious, and Baldessin slowly transformed Cavaliere’s approach into something idiosyncratic and deeply personal. Yet the basic tenets of Cavaliere’s philosophy remain traceable in Baldessin’s most admired work, the installation produced for the 1975 São Paulo Biennial – the sculpture Occasional <b>screens</b> with seating <b>arrangement</b> with the print suite Occasional images from a city chamber.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to find out how <b>screening</b> and {{referring}} <b>arrangements</b> of patients with malocclusions was working between different dental professional groups in the public dental health services in Troms County. We also wanted to find out to what extent general dentists in Troms County were involved in interceptive orthodontic treatment. Material and Methods: The study subjects were dental hygienists, dentists and orthodontists in Troms County. All dentists and dental hygienists working in the dental public health care in Troms County were invited to participate in the survey. After several reminders 18 dental hygienists, 39 general dentists and 6 orthodontists responded (total N= 63). The data was collected through a questionnaire, which included questions on personal data, orthodontic screening, treatment and referring, and a clinical photo of a unilateral posterior crossbite. Results: The response rate was 64 %. The most common age of referring children to orthodontic treatment was at 12 - 13 years of age. Late referral age (14 years or older) was significantly more often favored by dentists, as compared to the dental hygienists. 71 % of dental hygienists preferred referring patients straight to a specialist, and the rest made the decision between dentist and specialist. There was no significant difference (P= 0, 741) in the approximated number of referrals made by the dentists and dental hygienists. 62 % of the dentists and 44 % of the hygienists considered that treatment of unilateral posterior crossbite belonged to both dentists and specialists. Almost one third of the dentists reported that they did no orthodontic treatment at all. The most common malocclusion treated by the dentists was unilateral posterior crossbite. The procedures related to orthodontics done by dentists in their daily practice, were screening for malocclusion, preventive palpation of the position of permanent canines and primary tooth extractions due to orthodontic reasons. 83 % of the orthodontists consulted dentists regarding interceptive orthodontic treatments and/or planning treatments of patients. Conclusions: The majority of dentists in Troms County were involved in orthodontic treatment, but only to a small extent. Dental hygienists and dentists referred approximately the same number of patients to orthodontic treatment, but general dentists may prioritize later age of referral. Availability of continuing education in orthodontics might enhance the treatment skills and interest in orthodontics among the general practitioners...|$|R
