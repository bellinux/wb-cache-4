50|$|Santa Catarina Palopó is a {{municipality}} in the Sololá {{department of}} Guatemala. The municipality {{is located on}} the shores of Lake Atitlán, approximately 3 miles South-Southeast of Panajachel, a popular tourist destination. To the East-Southeast is San Antonio Palopó. The three aforementioned towns are connected by one paved road, which runs directly through Santa Catarina Palopó. The population of Santa Catarina Palopó is approximately 5,000 according to a 2011 census conducted by the town administration. The vast majority of the residents of the town are indigenous, descending from the Kaqchikel Maya. Kaqchikel is the most common language spoken in the village, though Spanish is widely understood. Subsistence agriculture and fishing are the means of survival for most families within the community, however, a recently spurred tourist industry has created a market for souvenir <b>style</b> <b>goods</b> and services. Perhaps the most easily recognizable characteristic of Santa Catarina Palopó is the blue huipil, or blouse, which is worn prominently by the women of the community. Since the guipil has been worn since the 16th century, it may seem to be particularly indigenous trait, the blue style is, however, the result of very recent external influences.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} simultaneously determining a production sequence and production volumes of <b>style</b> <b>goods.</b> <b>Style</b> <b>goods</b> have one selling season per year. During {{the rest of the}} year, manufacturers of <b>style</b> <b>goods</b> build up the inventory while continuously reestimating the demand in the final selling season. In this problem, products have a two-stage hierarchy: items and families. The production of a family is assumed to be nonpreemptive. Exploiting the hierarchical structure, we formulate the problem as a two-stage stochastic sequencing problem: the stochastic aggregate sequencing problem and the stochastic disaggregation problem. To solve the stochastic aggregate sequencing problem, a simple heuristic solution procedure is developed that accounts for the forecast revisions and provides a lower bound on the optimal value. The heuristic is tested using the disguised data obtained from a consumer electronics company. The computational results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed procedure. inventory/production, multi-item, approximations, stochastic scheduling...|$|E

40|$|A <b>Style</b> <b>Goods</b> Inventory Model is {{presented}} as a dynamic inventory problem with unknown demand. Assumptions are introduced which allow the model to be solved as a dynamic programming problem with one state variable instead of two. Application of the model is made through the development of a particular empirical demand estimating process. Further, the model is defined such that the results can be applied to a class of items with dissimilar costs and demand levels. ...|$|E
40|$|A <b>style</b> <b>goods</b> item has {{a finite}} selling {{period during which}} the sales rate varies in a {{seasonal}} and, to some extent, predictable fashion. There are {{only a limited number}} of opportunities to purchase or manufacture the <b>style</b> <b>goods</b> item, and the cost, in general, will depend on the time at which the item is obtained. The unit revenue achieved from sales of the item also varies during the selling season, and, in particular, reaches an appreciably lower terminal salvage value. Previous work on this class of problem has assumed one of the following: (a) There is a known deterministic sales rate during the season. (b) The sales are generated by a stochastic process having exactly known probabilities. Both of these formulations of the problem overlook what we believe to be an essential feature [...] that initially we have a great uncertainty concerning the sales potential of the item but have an opportunity to develop a better forecast as actual sales become known. The model discussed in this paper treats the sales potential of the item as a subjective random variable whose distribution is changed adaptively (through the use of Bayes' Rule) as the sales history unfolds. We examine several methods for encoding the prior knowledge that lead to a computationally feasible dynamic programming solution to the problem. An interesting feature of this approach is that the dynamic programming state represents both the unsold inventory of the item and the current state of knowledge concerning the sales potential. Numerical examples are discussed, showing the importance of formulating the problem, in a way that includes a state of knowledge that adaptively improves as demand becomes known. Finally, computational shortcuts that make problems of a larger scale computationally feasible are discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|Several recent papers {{extended}} the classical single-echelon "newsboy model" for <b>style</b> <b>goods</b> to two-echelons. That is, one studies the interactive decisions between the "manufacturer" and the "retailer" - now recognized as two separate entities. However, these papers assumed {{that there is}} only one retailer. This paper studies optimal decisions and outcomes pertaining to a system with one manufactory and multiple retail outlets. Compared are the optima from different market/ownership configurations - ranging from a fully integrated system (a single owner owns the manufactory and all retail outlets) to a situation in which all entities are separately owned and the manufacturer charges different retailers different prices ("differential pricing"). Some of our findings appear counter-intuitive; e. g., we show that, from the societal point of view, enforcing uniform pricing is no more desirable that permitting differential pricing. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|In this paper, {{the problem}} of {{forecasting}} a time series with {{only a small amount}} of data is addressed within the Bayesian framework.

These conditions appear in a natural way in the prediction of sales of <b>style</b> <b>goods</b> and coupon redemption among many other examples. A very simple model is proposed to describe the relation between the partial and the total value to be forecasted under the assumption of stable seasonality. Analytic results are obtained for both, the pointwise forecast and the entire posterior predictive distribution. The proposed technique does not involve any approximation. Moreover, it allows the use of non-informative priors so that implementation may be automatic. The procedure works well when standard methods cannot be applied due to the reduced number of observations. Some real examples are included...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{estimating}} the accumulated {{value of a}} positive and continuous variable for which some partially accumulated data has been observed, and usually with {{only a small number}} of observations (two years), can be approached taking advantage of the existence of stable seasonality (from one period to another). For example the quantity to be predicted may be the total for a period (year) and it needs to be made as soon as partial information becomes available for given subperiods (months). These conditions appear in a natural way in the prediction of seasonal sales of <b>style</b> <b>goods,</b> such as toys; in the behavior of inventories of goods where demand varies seasonally, such as fuels; or banking deposits, among many other examples. In this paper, the problem is addressed within a cluster sampling framework. A ratio estimator is proposed for the total value to be forecast under the assumption of stable seasonality. Estimators are obtained for both the point forecast and the variance. The procedure works well when standard methods cannot be applied due to the reduced number of observations. Some real examples are included as well as applications to some previously published data. Comparisons are made with other procedures...|$|E
40|$|The {{integrated}} {{colors of}} distant galaxies {{provide a means}} for interpreting the properties of their stellar content. Here, we use rest-frame UV-to-optical colors to constrain the spectral-energy distributions and stellar populations of color-selected, B-dropout galaxies at z ~ 4 in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey. We combine the ACS data with ground-based near-infrared images, which extend the coverage of galaxies at z ~ 4 to the rest-frame B-band. We observe a color-magnitude trend in the rest-frame m(UV) - B versus B diagram for the z ~ 4 galaxies that has a fairly well-defined "blue-envelope", and is strikingly {{similar to that of}} color-selected, U-dropout galaxies at z ~ 3. We also find that although the co-moving luminosity density at rest-frame UV wavelengths (1600 Angstroms) is roughly comparable at z ~ 3 and z ~ 4, the luminosity density at rest-frame optical wavelengths increases by about one-third from z ~ 4 to z ~ 3. Although the star-formation histories of individual galaxies may involve complex and stochastic events, the evolution in the global luminosity density of the UV-bright galaxy population corresponds to an average star-formation history with a star-formation rate that is constant or increasing over these redshifts. This suggests that the evolution in the luminosity density corresponds to an increase in the stellar-mass density of more than 33 %.
