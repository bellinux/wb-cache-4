5|$|New Labour {{tended to}} emphasise social justice, {{rather than the}} {{equality}} which {{was the focus of}} previous Labour governments, and challenged the view that social justice and economic efficiency are mutually exclusive. The party's traditional attachment to equality was reduced: Minimum standards and equality of opportunity were promoted over the equality of outcome. The Commission on Social Justice, set up by John Smith, reported in 1994 that the values of social justice were: equal worth of citizens, equal rights to be able to meet their basic needs, the requirement to spread opportunities as much as possible, and the need to remove unjustified inequalities. The party viewed social justice primarily as the requirement to give citizens equal political and economic liberty and also as the need for <b>social</b> <b>citizenship.</b> It encompasses the need for equal distribution of opportunity, with the caveat that things should not be taken from successful people to give to the unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|World War I {{veterans}} {{built on}} a history of postwar political activism {{to play an important}} role in the expansion of state-sponsored social welfare in Canada. Arguing that their wartime sacrifices had not been properly rewarded, veterans claimed that they were entitled to state protection from poverty and unemployment on the home front. The rhetoric of patriotism, courage, sacrifice, and duty created powerful demands for jobs, relief, and adequate pensions that should, veterans argued, be administered as a right of <b>social</b> <b>citizenship</b> and not a form of charity. At the local, provincial, and national political levels, veterans fought for compensation and recognition for their war service, and made their demands for jobs and social security a central part of emerging social policy.|$|E

2500|$|An {{economic}} crisis {{which began in}} 1976, bound women across class lines for the first time. Social issues gave women a new political voice as they demanded solutions to address problems created by the rural to urban migration which was taking place. Women formed neighborhood coalitions to deal with lack of housing, sanitation, transportation, utilities and water. As more people moved into cities to find work, lack of investment in those areas, as well as education and health facilities, became challenges that united women's efforts. Though these colonias populares (neighborhood movements) were making [...] "demands for genuine representation and state accountability as well as <b>social</b> <b>citizenship</b> rights" [...] they {{did not ask for}} systemic changes to improve women's societal positions. As the debt crisis intensified and Mexico devalued its currency to gain international loans, wages decreased while the cost of living escalated, causing more and more women to enter the workforce. Companies began hiring women because they could pay them lower wages, male unemployment soared, and feminist activity came to a standstill.|$|E
50|$|The current {{model of}} the welfare state, whereby <b>social</b> <b>citizenship</b> is obtained, {{encourages}} citizens to enter a “welfare market” in which they become consumers of welfare benefits, especially benefits linked to health and social care. Beginning in 1979, the conservative administration led by Margaret Thatcher encouraged this model, arguing that market based access to <b>social</b> <b>citizenship</b> allows for the empowerment of citizens. This capitalist model, advocates claim, allows citizens to obtain full <b>social</b> <b>citizenship</b> by becoming “competent members of society,” which according to citizenship theorists Turner and Marshall is a key aspect of {{being a member of}} the state. Whereas barred access to full <b>social</b> <b>citizenship</b> was combated by strengthening the private sector under Thatcher, the New Labour Government elected in 1997 focused on the expansion of public services in order to raise employment, and combat poverty. Under the New Labour government, social inclusion became one of the primary rights of <b>social</b> <b>citizenship</b> in Britain. Social inclusion is multifaceted and includes the right of a citizen to participate in society and the economy.|$|E

5000|$|Nancy Fraser and Linda Gordon in {{the essay}} “Contract versus Charity: Why is there no <b>Social</b> <b>Citizenship</b> in the United States?” {{expanded}} on T. H. Marshall's original proposition {{to look at how}} gender inequality has led to a dismissal of <b>social</b> <b>citizenship</b> within the United States. They argue that, because men were more powerful in civil society, within the “male sphere” “contractual relations dominated”, especially in regards to work with wage contracts. Gradually, the male sphere began to dominate more and more of human relations, and thus contractual relations encroached on more and more areas. Because of “the hegemony of contract… a specifically modern conception of ‘charity’” [...] was generated as a “complementary other.” Thus, welfare and helping the unfortunate became seen as a form of charity, rather than as an obligation. Because of this viewpoint, the receivers of charity were stigmatized for not “earning” the charity. [...] Fraser and Gordon also offer a solution to allowing <b>social</b> <b>citizenship</b> to gain popularity within the United States. They suggest that concentrating the focus of civil citizenship from “property-centered to a more solidaristic form” would allow citizens to reestablish ties with their community, something they believe is essential for citizens to have in order to believe in welfare and <b>social</b> <b>citizenship</b> as a whole.|$|E

50|$|<b>Social</b> <b>{{citizenship}}</b> was a term first {{coined by}} T.H.
