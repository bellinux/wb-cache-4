50|$|With two {{part-time}} <b>secretarial</b> <b>assistants,</b> MEED {{was produced}} on a hand-cranked Ronco printing machine. Every Friday evening, {{friends and relatives}} would help staple and stuff envelopes with the 12-page newsletter. Lacking any editorial resources, the Middle East Economic Digest was a compilation from newspapers and other reports. Newspapers were flown in weekly from Cairo and Beirut, translated and condensed.|$|R
50|$|Spy Fox (voiced by Bob Zenk in Dry Cereal and Cheese Chase and Mike Madeoy in {{the other}} three games) works for a spy agency called SPY Corps. His cohorts include Monkey Penny (his <b>secretarial</b> <b>assistant),</b> Professor Quack (creator of the SPY Corps gadgets), the SPY Corps Chief, and the four-armed, four-sleeved 'tracking bug', Walter Wireless.|$|R
50|$|Hoffman became {{engaged in}} her father's banking {{enterprises}} and was his <b>secretarial</b> <b>assistant</b> during his business trips around the United States and Europe. He died in 1949 and she then took over his seat on Bank of America's board of directors, becoming the bank's first female director. Her brother Lawrence died in 1952 {{and she took}} over his position in the bank also.|$|R
50|$|Gardiner met the King of Jordan, Hussein, {{while working}} as a <b>secretarial</b> <b>assistant</b> on the film set of Lawrence of Arabia. The King had allowed his troops to work as extras on this film and would {{occasionally}} visit to monitor the production's progress. However, there is another report, stating that Gardiner and the King met when her father began to work as a Military Adviser in Jordan.|$|R
50|$|In the 20th century Menabilly {{passed into}} the {{ownership}} of the Rashleigh baronets, descended from John Rashleigh (1742-1803) of Penquite, Cornwall, the fourth son of Jonathan III Rashleigh (1690-1764) of Menabilly. The owner in 2013 was Sir Richard Harry Rashleigh, 6th Baronet (born 1958), who in 1996 married Emma Felicity Clare McGougan (1961-2013), by whom he has two children, formerly a <b>secretarial</b> <b>assistant</b> to prime minister Margaret Thatcher.|$|R
50|$|Additional changes {{emerged in}} {{personnel}} as some left, {{while others were}} hired. A full-time <b>secretarial</b> <b>assistant,</b> Annpaige Bowles, had been hired {{a few years earlier}} to assist in the demanding office work {{and take care of the}} museum. Previous hires such as William Fulp, John Ilowiecki, and Barry Sheppard had been brought in to expand the force to include parts managers, couriers, engineers, and shock specialists. A Chassis dyno, shock dyno, and other new equipment were added.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} {{education program}} was started on March 1, 2000. It was housed in Trailer 13. As of 2001, by {{the approval of}} the School Board, this program was developed into a charter school called the New Directions Academy. The physical facility doubled in size and has a full-time director, three teachers and two <b>secretarial</b> <b>assistants.</b> The New Directions Academy continues to serve students from the middle school through the high school, but no longer is a charter school.|$|R
50|$|Griffin is {{a former}} member of Kerry County Council {{representing}} the Dingle area from 2009 to 2011. He was the subject of controversy for hiring his wife Róisín as his <b>secretarial</b> <b>assistant</b> and his cousin Tommy Griffin as his parliamentary assistant. Both these positions were filled without interview and have salaries paid for by the state. In addition, Griffin helped another cousin, Matt Griffin, get his old council seat. He takes half of his TD salary, at first giving the other half directly back to the exchequer and then in 2012 donating the other half of his salary to pay for a third teacher in a small rural Kerry school.|$|R
50|$|Rock first {{ran for a}} seat on the Dublin City Council in 2009, and was {{the last}} {{candidate}} deemed to not be elected in his LEA. He was the youngest candidate to run for {{a seat on the}} Council for a major party. In doing so he increased Fine Gael's share of the second-preference vote by 462%. In 2011 he was a campaign organizer for John Paul for the Dail, which successfully sought to elect John Paul Phelan to Dáil Éireann for Carlow-Kilkenny, where he topped the poll. Rock has also worked as a <b>secretarial</b> <b>assistant</b> for Catherine Noone, a Senator in the Seanad Éireann on the Industrial and Commercial Panel.|$|R
50|$|In the 16th and 17th centuries, the reis ül-küttab {{was drawn}} from the <b>senior</b> <b>secretarial</b> staff of the viziers or, more often, and from the early 17th century almost exclusively, the Grand Vizier. A regular line of {{promotion}} (tarik) was established, whereby one advanced from ordinary secretary (Persian: khalife, Turkish: kalfa) {{in one of the}} bureaux of the Grand Vizier's secretariat to senior clerk (ser-khalife or baş-kalfa) and eventually to bureau chief (mektubcı). The latter post entailed close proximity to the Grand Vizier and was a springboard for the highest offices. On rare occasions, the person chosen as reis ül-küttab was not one of the Grand Vizier's mektubcıs, but the secretary of the Kahya Bey, the Grand Vizier's lieutenant.|$|R
25|$|Einstein did {{not save}} {{all of his}} written material, but from 1919, as his fame increased, he {{employed}} his stepdaughter Ilse as a <b>secretarial</b> <b>assistant.</b> Helen Dukas (1896–1982) began working for Einstein with increased systematization from April 1928, although not all outgoing correspondence was saved. After the Nazis' rise to power in 1933, Einstein's son-in-law Rudolf Kayser, aided by the French Embassy, rescued Einstein's papers in Berlin. Some of the material at Einstein's summer house in Caputh, Brandenburg was destroyed to avoid seizure, although most of his works between 1930 and 1932 were saved. That material was transported via Haberlandstrasse where Einstein lived in Berlin, then to Paris, and ended up stored in Princeton, New Jersey, United States until after Einstein's death.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe central {{research}} question {{of this paper}} is how notions developed in interactive computing such as abstract behavior types, the coordination language Reo, and Boolean circuits with registers, can be used to extend logical input/output nets, or lions for short. Lions are based on input/output logic, a deontic logic which is not used as a (non-classical) inference engine deriving output from input, but as a <b>secretarial</b> <b>assistant</b> for logically assisted transformations from input to output. We consider two extensions of input/output logics and lions. First, we consider input/output logics defined on infinite sequences (or streams) of inputs and outputs. Secondly, we consider lions with AND and register gates, formalizing the behavior of channels and connectors. We discuss also the role of interactive computing in normative multi-agent systems motivating the development of lions...|$|R
5000|$|Jane Hathaway (Nancy Kulp in 246 episodes), {{whom the}} Clampetts address as [...] "Miss Jane", is Drysdale's loyal and {{efficient}} <b>secretarial</b> <b>assistant.</b> Though she always carries out his wishes, she is inherently decent and is frequently {{put off by}} her boss's greed. When she is annoyed with him, {{as is often the}} case, especially when one of Drysdale's schemes goes too far, she usually and forcefully says, [...] "Chief!" [...] Jane is genuinely fond of the family (to the Clampetts, she is considered family; even Granny, the one most dead-set against living in California, likes her very much); Jane actually harbors something of a crush on Jethro for most of the series' run. At first, she mistakes the Clampetts as servants until Drysdale told her who they really are (which almost costs her her job).|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss the}} use of NL systems {{in the domain of}} {{appointment}} scheduling. Appointment scheduling is a problem faced daily by many people and organizations, and typically solved using communication in natural language. In general, cooperative interaction between several participants is required whose calendar data are distributed rather than centralized. In this distributed multi-agent environment, {{the use of}} NL systems makes it possible for machines and humans to cooperate in solving scheduling problems. We describe the cosma (Cooperative Schedule Managament Agent) system, a <b>secretarial</b> <b>assistant</b> for appointment scheduling. A central part of cosma is the reusable NL core system DISCO, which serves, in this application, as an NL interface between an appointment planning system and the human user. cosma is fully implemented in Common Lisp and runs on Unix Workstations. Our experience with cosma shows that it is a plausible and useful application for NL systems. However, the [...] ...|$|R
25|$|In 2007, it was {{announced}} that civil service salaries had lagged behind those in the private sector and required revision. MPs' salaries were therefore increased in phases. In 2007, the monthly allowance was revised to $13,200, raising the annual sum to $158,400. A gross domestic product (GDP) bonus payable to civil servants was also extended to MPs to link their annual remuneration to the state of the economy. They would receive no bonus if GDP growth was 2% or less, one month's bonus if the GDP grew at 5%, and up to two months' bonus if the GDP growth reached or exceeded 8%. MPs' allowances to engage legislative and <b>secretarial</b> <b>assistants</b> were also increased from $1,000 to $1,300 and from $350 to $500 respectively. With effect from January 2008, each MP received another increase of his or her allowance package to $13,710 a month, bringing it to $225,000 per year. Subsequently, in 2012, MP's allowances were reduced to $192,500 per annum.|$|R
5000|$|In 1932, at the grandly titled [...] "first world congress" [...] of the International Red Aid (IRH - workers' welfare) organisation, Rubiner {{was elected}} to a <b>senior</b> <b>secretarial</b> post with IRH, [...] which she held between December 1932 and August 1933. [...] Later {{she moved to the}} Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI) where between 1932 (or 1933) and 1935 she headed up a {{department}} in the Press section. [...] In the wake of the murder of Sergey Kirov at the end of 1934 the ECCI underwent a general [...] "personnel purge", and Rubiner {{was the subject of a}} denunciation from a cell within the ECCI criticising her [...] "insufficient vigilance", based on the assertion that she had numbered among her acquaintances ECCI colleagues identified as [...] "enemies of the people". The reprimand was soon cancelled by the relevant Moscow Committee control commission. [...] Through the Stalinist purges of the later 1930s, any surveillance to which Rubiner was subject seems to have been relatively benign. [...] In 1936 she acquired Soviet citizenship.|$|R
50|$|Almost all of {{the latest}} voice-chipped talking clocks {{incorporate}} the female human voice to announce the time. Dr. Mark McKinley, {{the president of the}} International Society of Talking Clock Collectors, proposes three possible explanations for this phenomenon. The female voice may be considered more soothing psychologically; it may be a relic of the female voice being historically associated with <b>secretarial</b> (Administrative <b>Assistant)</b> functions; or a feminine voice may possibly simply be softer in a less intrusive way.|$|R

500|$|Finkelstein noted 20 instances, {{in as many}} pages, where Dershowitz's book {{cites the}} same sources and {{passages}} used by Joan Peters in her book, in largely the same sequence, with ellipses in the same places. In two instances, Dershowitz reproduces Peters's errors (see below). From this Finkelstein concluded that Dershowitz had not checked the original sources himself, contrary to the latter's claims. Finkelstein suggests that this copying of quotations amounts to copying ideas. Examining {{a copy of a}} proof of Dershowitz's book he managed to obtain, he found evidence that Dershowitz had his <b>secretarial</b> <b>assistant,</b> Holly Beth Billington, check in the Harvard library the sources he had read in Peters's book. Dershowitz answered the charge {{in a letter to the}} University of California's Press Director Lynne Withey, arguing that Finkelstein had made up the smoking gun quotation, in that he had changed its wording (from 'cite' to 'copy') in his book. In public debate he has stated that if [...] "somebody borrowed the quote without going to check back on whether Mark Twain had said that, obviously that would be a serious charge"; however, he insisted emphatically that he himself did not do that, that he had indeed checked the original source by Twain.|$|R
50|$|Jackie Healy-Rae {{grew up on}} a small farm, {{returned}} after emigrating to the United States, and developed building-supply and retail businesses. He was a member of Kerry County Council in the Killarney local electoral area (LEA) from 1973 until 2003, as a Fianna Fáil member until the 1997 general election; the party did not select him as a candidate in Kerry South so he ran as an independent and unexpectedly won a seat in the 28th Dáil. At the 1999 local elections his son Michael joined Jackie on the council, representing Killorglin LEA. When the dual mandate was abolished in 2003, Jackie vacated his council seat and another son, Danny, was co-opted in his place. At the 2011 general election, Jackie retired and Michael was elected to the Dáil, with his council seat filled by Danny's son Johnny. At the 2014 local elections, Danny retained his Killarney seat while Johnny won in the new South and West Kerry LEA. At the 2016 general election, in the enlarged Kerry constituency, Danny just before nominations closed joined Michael as a candidate. They ran a united campaign with strict vote management and both were elected. Danny's daughter Maura was co-opted onto the council as his replacement. Michael's parliamentary assistant (PA) is his son Jackie junior; Danny's PA is his wife Eileen, while his <b>secretarial</b> <b>assistant</b> position is job-shared between his daughter Elaine and Johnny's wife Caroline O'Mahony.|$|R

2500|$|In September 2011, Ahern said he {{believed}} {{that he would have}} [...] "done all right" [...] in the presidential election but for the decline in the popularity of Fianna Fáil. Ahern confirmed he considered running in the election. [...] "I still would have done all right. I mean they have done some figures and I would probably sit in around 30 per cent, which you haven’t a hope with as the party is on 20 per cent." [...] He added that [...] "the party popularity is the thing that snookers it, because if your party isn’t winnable..." [...] Mr Ahern said: [...] "If there was no downturn and if it wasn’t all the hassle of the tribunals and everything else, then you could have had a good run at it." [...] He predicted that [...] "nobody is going to win it outright – like Mary McAleese had it won on the first count". Asked about a possible future candidacy in the following presidential election, he said: [...] "Normally what happens in this country, if a president does a good job they stay on, so that’s 14 years, so that ends any chance that I’ll have." [...] He also rejected suggestions that the Mahon tribunal would reject the evidence he gave on his personal finances. [...] "The only thing that is important to me is the central allegations. And what the tribunal says about the other trash is irrelevant." [...] Michael Martin said the former taoiseach was [...] "out of touch with reality" [...] if {{he believed}} he could have won the presidency for Fianna Fáil. Martin also said expenses paid to Mr Ahern in his capacity as a former taoiseach were too high and should be reduced. He was commenting on reports that Mr Ahern had claimed €265,000 for [...] "secretarial services" [...] and €7,500 on mobile phone bills since he stepped down in May 2008. Under the current expenses regime, a former taoiseach may employ two <b>secretarial</b> <b>assistants</b> for up to five years after leaving office and one indefinitely after that.|$|R
40|$|Two {{important}} factors {{that marked the}} rise of the professions of secretary, assistant manager respectively are technical developments in communication and control systems. Globally, secretaries and assistants can be found in any organization, regardless of the nature, origin of capital, organization size, etc. In Romania, concepts of secretary and assistant manager two formulas are moving today to describe the same type of activity.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the sources of job satisfaction and dissatisfaction for classified employees in a large public suburban school district. The population included randomly-selected bus drivers, custodians, school and non-school <b>secretarial</b> employees, instructional <b>assistants,</b> maintenance workers, food service personnel and technical employees. Three research questions were posed: (a) What are the primary sources of job satisfaction and dissatisfaction for classified employees? (b) Is there {{a significant difference in}} job satisfaction among the specific categories of classified employees? (c) Are demographic/personal variables of classified employees related to overall job satisfaction? The study incorporated both qualitative and quantitative methodology. Focus groups were convened to identify satisfiers and dissatisfiers, which then served as a basis for questionnaire development. Sixty-four individuals participated in focus group discussions; 490 questionnaires were returned for a response rate of 78 %. The self-designed questionnaire contained 100 job variables, including a single direct question of overall satisfaction. The assessment also included twelve demographic/personal variables and two open-ended questions. Data were statistically analyzed using ANOVA, ANCOVA, the Chi square test, multiple regression, and paired comparisons. The primary job satisfiers for all classified employees were: co-workers, students, work itself, work variety, autonomy, and work schedule. Dissatisfiers were: work overload, district policies, and job insecurity. There was a significant difference in job satisfaction among employee groups. There was also a significant difference in job satisfaction for the demographic variables of gender, work setting, and number of hours worked, even after the influence of job category was eliminated. The research suggests that there are issues which influence the job satisfaction of classified employees. In their quest for excellence, school district administrators, and business leaders, alike, can benefit from listening to the needs and recommendations of their support personnel...|$|R
