25|$|Feeling of Knowing (FOK) {{judgments}} {{refer to}} the predictions {{of being able to}} retrieve specific information an individual makes, regarding his or her knowledge for a specific subject, more specifically whether that knowledge exists within memory. These judgments are made either prior to the memory target being found or following a failed attempt to locate the target. Consequently, FOK judgments focus not on the actual answer to a question, but rather on whether an individual predicts that he or she does or does not know the answer (high and low FOK ratings respectively). FOK judgments can also be made regarding the likelihood of remembering information later on and have proven to give fairly accurate indications of future memory. An example of FOK is if you can't remember the answer when <b>someone</b> <b>asks</b> you what city you're traveling to, but you feel that you would recognize the name if you saw it on a map of the country.|$|E
500|$|In 2007 the duo fronted the UK {{version of}} Apple Inc.'s [...] "Get a Mac" [...] adverts, with Mitchell playing PC. The adverts {{received}} much criticism. Writing in The Guardian, Charlie Brooker {{claimed that the}} use of Mitchell and Webb in the adverts was a curious choice. He compared the characters of PC and Mac in the adverts to those of Mark and Jeremy in Peep Show, stating that [...] "when you see the ads, you think, 'PCs are a bit rubbish yet ultimately lovable, whereas Macs are just smug, preening tossers.'" [...] The British Sitcom Guide also criticised the pair for [...] "selling their souls". One journalist called the adverts [...] "worse than not funny", and accused Mitchell and Webb of [...] "an act of grave betrayal" [...] for taking corporate work. In an interview with The Telegraph, Robert Webb responded to the duo's critics, stating that [...] "when <b>someone</b> <b>asks,</b> 'Do you want to do some funny ads for not many days in the year and be paid more than you would be for an entire series of Peep Show?' the answer, obviously, is, 'Yeah, that's fine.'" [...] In the same interview, Mitchell also said: [...] "I don't see what is morally inconsistent with a comedian doing an advert. It's all right to sell computers, isn't it? Unless you think that capitalism is evil– which I don't. It's not like we're helping to flog a baby-killing machine." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{application}} of the traditional [...] "man" [...] and traditional [...] "woman" [...] in lesbian relationships is common, as with gay male relationships. Most often in lesbian relationships, there will come a point when <b>someone</b> <b>asks</b> the question: [...] "So which one's the guy?", even if no males {{are involved in the}} relationship. This is believed to stem from heteronormative and patriarchal setups of traditional heterosexual relationships.|$|E
2500|$|Ciara {{spoke of}} Michael Jackson's legacy, [...] "Whenever <b>someone</b> <b>asks</b> me who inspires {{me to do}} what I do, I always say Michael. That's it for me. He's {{everything}} to me. He's really {{a part of the}} reason why. He's going to be remembered in so many ways for me. I feel it's important for me to continue to let my generation know how important he was to music." [...] Ciara also cites Whitney Houston, Aaliyah, TLC, SWV, Monica and Salt-n-Pepa, as influences. Her second studio album [...] (2006) was influenced by Michael Jackson, Prince, and pop singer Madonna.|$|E

2500|$|When <b>someone</b> <b>asks</b> {{a person}} a {{question}} such as [...] "What is your name?", the person automatically knows the answer. However, when <b>someone</b> <b>asks</b> a person a question such as [...] "What {{was the fifth}} dinosaur ever discovered?", the person also automatically knows {{that he or she}} does not know the answer. [...] A person knowing that he or she does not know is another aspect of metamemory that enables people to respond quickly when asked a question that they do not know the answer to. In other words, people are {{aware of the fact that}} they do not know certain information and do not have to go through the process of trying to find the answer within their memories, since they know the information in question will never be remembered. One theory as to why this knowledge of not knowing is so rapidly retrieved is consistent with the cue-familiarity hypothesis. The cue familiarity hypothesis states that metamemory judgments are made based on the familiarity of the information presented in the cue. The more familiar the information in the memory cue, the more likely a person will make the judgment that he or she knows that the target information is in memory. With regards to knowing that you don't know, if the memory cue information does not elicit any familiarity, then a person quickly judges that the information is not stored in memory.|$|E
2500|$|Even though {{minor league}} players are paid {{considerably}} less than their major league counterparts, they are nevertheless paid for their services and are thus considered professional athletes. Minor league salaries vary based on class level and length of season; however, the majority of players make less than $10,000 per season. Baseball cards refer to [...] "pro record" [...] and [...] "pro seasons" [...] as including both major and minor leagues. For this reason, minor league players generally consider it an insult when <b>someone</b> <b>asks</b> when they're going to [...] "get to the pros". More accurately, a player's aim is to reach [...] "The Show" [...] or the [...] "big leagues." ...|$|E

Her British father, Gerry Campbell, immigrated to Canada from his native Glasgow, Scotland, and taught high school drama classes in Mississauga, Ontario. Campbell's maternal grandparents ran a theater company in the Netherlands, and her paternal grandparents were also performers. On her mother's side, Campbell is descended from Sephardi Jews who immigrated to the Netherlands and converted to Catholicism. She has stated, [...] "I am a practising Catholic, but my lineage is Jewish, so if <b>someone</b> <b>asks</b> me if I'm Jewish, I say yes." ...|$|E

Additionally, Howard along with fellow LGBT Activists Robert A. Martin (aka Donny the Punk) and L. Craig Schoonmaker are credited with popularizing the word [...] "Pride" [...] to describe these festivities.

2500|$|When <b>someone</b> <b>asks</b> a Muslim scholar about {{performing}} a specific action, the reply {{will be a}} fatwa explaining which of these five categories this action would fall under. So if you ask a Muslim scholar to give a fatwa about adultery, they {{would tell you that}} it is [...] "Not Permitted". If you ask about fasting in Ramadan, they would answer that it is [...] "Obligatory". Muslims are usually encouraged to ask for reasoning and evidence behind any fatwa, and should avoid blindly following the opinions of Muslim scholars without understanding the reasons behind them. This is because Muslims should always feel that they are practicing Islam to gain the pleasure of God, and not to gain the pleasure of acceptance of any human being.|$|E
2500|$|Searle defines {{intentionality}} as {{the power}} of minds to be about, to represent (see Correspondence theory of truth), or to stand for, things, properties and states of affairs in the world. The nature of intentionality {{is an important part}} of discussions of Searle's [...] "Philosophy of Mind". Searle emphasizes that the word ‘intentionality, (the part of the mind directed to/from/about objects and relations in the world independent of mind) should not be confused with the word ‘intensionality’ (the logical property of some sentences that do not pass the test of 'extensionality'). In Intentionality: An Essay in the Philosophy of Mind (1983), Searle applies certain elements of his account(s) of [...] "illocutionary acts" [...] to the investigation of intentionality. Searle also introduces a technical term the Background, which, according to him, has been the source of much philosophical discussion ("though I have been arguing for this thesis for almost twenty years," [...] Searle writes, [...] "many people whose opinions I respect still disagree with me about it.") Background he calls the set of abilities, capacities, tendencies, and dispositions that humans have and that are not themselves intentional states. Thus, when <b>someone</b> <b>asks</b> us to [...] "cut the cake" [...] we know to use a knife and when <b>someone</b> <b>asks</b> us to [...] "cut the grass" [...] we know to use a lawnmower (and not vice versa), even though the actual request did not include this detail. Searle sometimes supplements his reference to the Background with the concept of the Network, one's network of other beliefs, desires, and other intentional states necessary for any particular intentional state to make sense. Searle argues that the concept of a Background is similar to the concepts provided by several other thinkers, including Wittgenstein's private language argument ("the work of the later Wittgenstein is in large part about the Background") and Pierre Bourdieu's habitus.|$|E
