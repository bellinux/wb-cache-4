25|$|In 2003, Cleland {{began working}} for the 2004 presidential {{campaign}} of Massachusetts senator John Kerry, also a Vietnam veteran; Kerry {{went on to win}} the Democratic nomination. Cleland often appeared at campaign events with Kerry and was considered by many to be one of his most important surrogates, partly as a symbol of the sacrifices made by soldiers for wars. He went to Bush's Texas ranch to deliver a <b>swift</b> <b>boat</b> ad complaint, but the event failed to have much impact.

500|$|During this period, Beauregard {{promoted}} innovative naval defense strategies, such {{as early}} experimentation with submarines, naval mines (called [...] "torpedoes" [...] in the Civil War), {{and with a}} small vessel called a torpedo-ram. A <b>swift</b> <b>boat</b> fitted with a torpedo on a pole projecting from its bow under water, {{it could be used}} to surprise an enemy vessel and impale it underneath the water line. He was also busy devising strategies for other generals in the Confederacy. He proposed that some of the state governors meet with Union governors of the Western states (what are called the Midwest states today) for a peace conference. The Davis administration rejected the idea, but it caused considerable political maneuvering by Davis's enemies in the Congress. Beauregard also proposed a grand strategy—submitted anonymously through his political allies so that it was not tainted by his reputation—to reinforce the Western armies at the expense of Robert E. Lee's army in Virginia, destroy the Federal army in Tennessee, which would induce Ulysses S. Grant to relieve pressure on Vicksburg and maneuver his army into a place where it could be destroyed. The Confederate Army would continue to Ohio, and induce the Western states to ally with the Confederacy. Meanwhile, a fleet of torpedo-rams built in England could be used to recapture New Orleans, ending the war. There is no record that his plan was ever officially presented to the government.|$|E

During a 2008 teleconference with reporters from the Miami Herald, Day made comments regarding John McCain's stance on the Iraq War, stating that [...] "I don't intend to kneel, and I don't advocate to anybody that we kneel, and John [...] doesn't advocate to anybody that we kneel."
