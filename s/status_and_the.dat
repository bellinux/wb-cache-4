5|$|Despite {{her years}} of service, {{she had never}} {{received}} a regular salary and was for years denied compensation. Her unofficial <b>status</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> unequal payments offered to black soldiers caused great difficulty in documenting her service, and the U.S. government was slow in recognizing its debt to her. Tubman did not receive a pension for her service in the Civil War until 1899. Her constant humanitarian work for her family and former slaves, meanwhile, kept her {{in a state of}} constant poverty, and her difficulties in obtaining a government pension were especially taxing for her.|$|E
5|$|Despite the expedition's failure, Carrouges had {{distinguished}} {{himself in}} the campaign.

5|$|High Explosive Research was the British {{project to}} {{independently}} develop atomic bombs after the Second World War.

The decision was publicly announced in the House of Commons on 12 May 1948.|$|E
5|$|The populations {{on the two}} islands were {{classified}} as separate species when P. abelii was described by Lesson in 1827.

5|$|While at peak intensity, Jery began {{turning to}} the south, due to {{reaching}} {{the western edge of}} a ridge. An approaching trough increased wind shear over the storm, causing the convection to diminish and expose the center. Late on April10 it weakened below tropical cyclone <b>status,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> next day Jery became extratropical. Shortly thereafter the remnants crossed into the Australian region, dissipating on April13.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} peak intensity, {{an increase}} in wind shear caused the eye to disappear, and the convection decreased significantly. On December1, the IMD estimated Agni weakened to cyclonic storm status, around which time the center became exposed from the convection. The cyclone continued its steady weakening continued due to the wind shear, the presence of dry air, and cooler water temperatures, and by December2, the IMD downgraded Agni to depression status, which was its final warning on the system. As it approached the coast of Somalia, it turned westward due to {{the building of a}} ridge over Saudi Arabia. Despite unfavorable conditions, thunderstorms briefly reformed over the circulation, which allowed the storm to maintain its intensity. By late on December3, Agni weakened to below tropical storm <b>status,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> JTWC issued its final warning while the storm was about 450km (275mi) south-southeast of Cape Guardafui—the easternmost point of the Horn of Africa. The circulation became difficult to locate by early on December4, by which time the system had little remaining convection. It turned southwestward and later to the south, moving ashore on eastern Somalia before dissipating on December5 near Ceel Huur over water.|$|E
5|$|Ebla {{maintained}} its prosperity through a vast trading network. Artifacts from Sumer, Cyprus, Egypt {{and as far}} as Afghanistan were recovered from the city's palaces. The kingdom had its own language, Eblaite and the political organization of Ebla had features different from the Sumerian model. Women enjoyed a special <b>status</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> queen had major influence in the state and religious affairs. The pantheon of gods was mainly north Semitic and included deities exclusive to Ebla. The city was excavated starting in 1964, and became famous for the Ebla tablets, an archive of about 20,000 cuneiform tablets found there, dated to around 2350 BC. Written in both Sumerian and Eblaite and using the cuneiform, the archive has allowed {{a better understanding of the}} Sumerian language and provided important information over the political organization and social customs of the mid third millennium BC's Levant.|$|E

5|$|From May until August 1910, {{the forest}} reserve supervisor, Fremont Nathan Haines, managed the park's {{resources}} {{as the first}} acting superintendent. In August 1910, William Logan was appointed the park's first superintendent. While the designation of the forest reserve confirmed the traditional usage rights of the Blackfeet, the enabling legislation of the national park does not mention the guarantees to the Native Americans. It is {{the position of the}} United States government that with the special designation as a National Park the mountains ceded their multi-purpose public land <b>status</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> former rights ceased to exist as it was confirmed by the Court of Claims in 1935. Some Blackfeet held that their traditional usage rights still exist de jure. In the 1890s, armed standoffs were avoided narrowly several times.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Olivia was {{considered}} the worst hurricane to hit Mazatlán, Sinaloa since 1943, {{in addition to being}} the strongest landfalling and costliest hurricane of the 1975 Pacific hurricane season. Olivia formed on October22 to the south of Mexico, quickly intensifying into a tropical storm. The storm moved northwestward initially, followed by a northeast turn. On October23, Olivia attained hurricane <b>status,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> next day reached Category3 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson scale just before moving ashore Mazatlán in northwest Mexico. Olivia destroyed 7,000houses in the region, leaving 30,000people homeless, and damage totaled $20million (1975USD, $ USD). The hurricane killed 30people, 20 of them from drowning in shrimp boats.|$|E

5|$|In late October, the ITCZ {{developed}} a persistent area of convection {{west of the}} Indonesian island of Sumatra. A tropical low formed on October28 within the Australian region, which initially failed to develop much due to persistent wind shear. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) named the system Melanie on October31 {{to the north of}} the Cocos Islands. The newly upgraded storm tracked generally westward due to a ridge to the south, and entered the south-west Indian Ocean on November1 as a strong tropical storm. At that time, Melanie was renamed Bellamine. After the ridged moved farther away, the storm turned more to the southwest and began quickly intensifying. Early on November3, Bellamine attained tropical cyclone <b>status,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> next day reached peak 10minute winds of 175km/h (110mph); this made it an intense tropical cyclone.|$|E

5|$|The more skin left {{unarmoured}} and exposed, {{the lower}} a gladiator's <b>status</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> greater his perceived effeminacy. Likewise, the engulfing net {{may have been}} seen as a feminine symbol. The light arms and armour of the retiarius thus established him as the lowliest, most disgraced, and most effeminate of the gladiator types. Helmets allowed both gladiators and spectators to dehumanise the fighters; when an arena combatant had to kill a comrade-at-arms, someone he probably lived and trained with every day, his opponent's helmet added an extra layer of separation. However, the retiarius was allowed no head protection; his face was visible to all. The emperor Claudius had all net-fighters who lost in combat put to death so that spectators could enjoy their expressions of agony. The retiariuss fighting style was another strike against him, as reliance on speed and evasion were viewed as undignified in comparison to the straightforward trading of blows. The retiarii lived in the worst barracks. Some members of the class trained to fight as Samnites, another gladiator type, in order to improve their status.|$|E
5|$|We {{shall not}} feel that the generalization, {{unqualified}} and to be taken literally, is meant to march out of its context {{to compete with the}} scientific and philosophical generalizations which dominate our world. 'Beauty is truth, truth beauty' has precisely the same <b>status,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> same justification as Shakespeare's 'Ripeness is all.' It is a speech 'in character' and supported by a dramatic context. To conclude thus may seem to weight the principle of dramatic propriety with more than it can bear. This would not be fair to the complexity of the problem of truth in art nor fair to Keats's little parable. Granted; and yet the principle of dramatic propriety may take us further than would first appear. Respect for it may at least insure our dealing with the problem of truth at the level on which it is really relevant to literature.|$|E
5|$|With the {{competition}} lost, {{the development of}} the XSBF-1 came to an end; the sole prototype was assigned to Naval Air Station Anacostia, where it had been tested, for use as a liaison aircraft and hack. In addition, the XSBF was used by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics' Langley Research Laboratory as part of the facility's work on aeronautical research. During its time at Anacostia, the aircraft was involved in three accidents, one each in 1937, 1938 and 1939; after the first two accidents, it was repaired. The third accident—on May 25, 1939—resulted in the death of the pilot; the XSBF-1 was no longer considered worth returning to flight <b>status,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> aircraft was officially stricken from the Navy inventory in July 1939.|$|E
