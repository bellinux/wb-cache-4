By 14:00, the Allied fleet had {{positioned}} itself in the Italians' path, and Cunningham ordered them west, to close on the projected position of the enemy and engage. Sydney spotted smoke at 14:45, and made visual contact with a force of five cruisers just after 15:00.

[...] In this study, the experimenters disrupted the RMS in mice, which obstructed “the uptake of intranasally administered radioligands into the CNS.” [...] Fluorescent tracers were also used to track the medicine throughout the brain. [...] It was found that the medicine spread to all regions of the brain, including the olfactory bulb. [...] The study concluded that the RMS was extremely prevalent and necessary in the central nervous system in order to deliver drugs intranasally. [...] The study also noted that this research on the RMS is not sufficient, but instead needs to be expanded. [...] Some of the limits and capabilities of the RMS are still unknown, {{as well as some of}} the hazards of it.

Before the storm began producing heavy rainfall, officials anticipated moderate river flooding that would peak at less than the flood of 1948. The river crested at Laredo, Texas, where waters reached a peak of 62.2feet (19m), at least 10feet (3m) above the previous record flood. High waters caused the water treatment plants to fail there, which prevented the <b>safe</b> <b>delivery</b> of fresh water until July1. The International Bridge connecting Laredo and Nuevo Laredo was swept away. Although severe damage occurred in the latter city, no deaths were recorded in either city due to evacuations. Flooding along the Rio Grande was the highest since 1865, and was considered a 1 in 2000 year event. About 12,000people were evacuated from nearby Ciudad Acuña following the flood.

40|$|Background: In September 2000, the Heads of States of the 191 {{countries}} of the United Nations approved the Millennium Declaration in which reduction of pregnancy-related deaths to a quarter by 2015 was one of its goals. However, before {{the middle of the}} first decade of this millennium, there were no reports on the status of maternal mortality in Maroua, Cameroon. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} establish baseline data on maternal mortality for future evaluation of pregnancy-related mortality trends in this city. Subjects and Methods: Maternal deaths that occurred from 2003 to 2005 in Maroua City, Cameroon, were analyzed. Mortality ratios were determined by comparing the number of the deaths related to pregnancy with that of women with <b>safe</b> <b>deliveries.</b> Mortality risks were determined by comparing the characteristics of women with pregnancy-related deaths to those of women with <b>safe</b> <b>deliveries.</b> Results: The overall maternal mortality ratio was 1266 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births. The leading causes of death were hypertension (17. 5 %), obstetric infections (14. 3 %), uterine rupture (14. 3 %), anaemia (12. 7 %) and HIV complications (9. 5 %). Among the women who died, 28. 6 % were teenagers and 14. 3 % were at their sixth delivery (or above). Compared with women aged 20 to 24 years, those aged 25 to 29 years were more than twice as likely to die from pregnancy-related causes (HR: 2. 34; CI: 1. 07, 5. 08; p = 0. 029). A similar trend was also found in those aged 30 to 34 years (HR...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Gene {{therapy has}} been {{investigated}} in many aspects of plastic and reconstructive surgery. These areas ultimately involve various forms of tissue healing and the manipulation of bony and soft tissues to reconstruct defects secondary to neoplastic and congenital disorders and trauma.

Overall, these preliminary studies have produced optimistic results. With the development of more efficient and <b>safer</b> <b>delivery</b> systems, the application of gene therapy in plastic surgery could become more widespread, especially in combination with tissue engineering technology...|$|R
