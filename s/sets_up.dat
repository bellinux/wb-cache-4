5|$|In {{a note on}} torsion, Thompson {{mentions}} Charles Darwin's {{treatment of}} climbing plants which often spiral around a support, noting that Darwin also observed that the spiralling stems were themselves twisted. Thompson disagrees with Darwin's teleological explanation, that the twisting makes the stems stiffer {{in the same way}} as the twisting of a rope; Thompson's view is that the mechanical adhesion of the climbing stem to the support <b>sets</b> <b>up</b> a system of forces which act as a 'couple' offset from the centre of the stem, making it twist.|$|E

40|$|Zero Inventory (ZI) {{is a new}} and {{powerful}} concept to improve production efficiency. Underpinning ZI is <b>set</b> <b>up</b> reduction and this paper examines what eventuates when <b>set</b> <b>up</b> costs are cut. The folklore is that <b>set</b> <b>up</b> reduction lowers inventory and costs. We obtain results contrary to that. Reducing <b>set</b> <b>up</b> costs need not reduce inventory, for example. Likewise lowering <b>set</b> <b>up</b> costs need not necessarily lower total production and inventory costs. Furthermore, most investments produce marginally decreasing returns. <b>Set</b> <b>up</b> cost reduction prompts the opposite; it produces marginally increasing (not decreasing) returns. A parametric algorithm that calculates the benefit of <b>set</b> <b>up</b> cost reduction is provided. Most presentations of ZI have been descriptive with very few mathematical models of it yet untaken. By modeling certain ZI concepts mathematically, we scrutinize their validity and sometimes invalidity. inventory/production: zero inventory, facilities/equipment: planning, inventory/production: parametric analysis...|$|R

5|$|From the Greek {{word for}} pan pipes, σύριγξ, {{it is the}} vocal organ of birds. Located {{at the base of}} a bird's trachea, it {{produces}} sounds without the vocal folds of mammals. The sound is produced by vibrations of some or all of the membrana tympaniformis (the walls of the syrinx) and the pessulus, caused by air flowing through the syrinx. This <b>sets</b> <b>up</b> a self-oscillating system that modulates the airflow creating the sound. The muscles modulate the sound shape by changing the tension of the membranes and the bronchial openings. The syrinx enables some species of birds (such as parrots, crows, and mynas) to mimic human speech. Unlike the larynx of mammals, the syrinx is located where the trachea forks into the lungs. Thus, lateralization of bird song is possible and some songbirds can produce more than one sound at a time.|$|E
