25|$|Named after Mount Ainslie, Australian Capital Territory {{where their}} type {{location}} occurs, the Ainslie Volcanics {{are composed of}} Dacitic ignimbrite and minor volcaniclastic and argillaceous sediments. The lithology is bluish grey dacitic tuff, which can be massive or foliated, also dacitic agglomerate and shale. These volcanics contain chloritised cordierite and some have red almandine garnet. Jasper is found on low hills {{on the north side}} of the Molonglo River. The thickness is at least 700 metres. The magma was formed by melting an aluminiumrich pelitic sediment. The eruption came from a volcano into shallow sea water. The deposits built above sea level as they progressed. The underlying sediments now make up the Canberra Formation. Between Hall and Namina Hill on <b>Spring</b> <b>Range,</b> the Mount Painter Volcanics lie unconformably on top.|$|E

40|$|Geologic mapping in the Panamint Mountains and Resting <b>Springs</b> <b>Range</b> has {{uncovered}} a structural piercing point {{that is used}} in the reconstruction of the Death Valley Region. Northwest and northeast trends of lineations, folds, and cleavages indicate a piercing point that links the Panamint Mountains and the Resting <b>Springs</b> <b>Range</b> together. The mountain blocks both display linear features that record northwest- and northeast-trending features and fault blocks which contain different histories of folding recorded by the rocks. The Resting <b>Springs</b> <b>Range</b> contains early, northeast-trending structures that have been overprinted by northwest-trending structures and are correlated to the Panamint Mountains which display similar measurements that show two generations of deformation analogous to the Resting <b>Springs</b> <b>Range.</b> Structural data recovered from faults and bedding has indicated that the Panamint Mountains and the Resting <b>Springs</b> <b>Range</b> were once in the same structural sheet for several eastward propagating thrust faults. These faults left behind distinct generations of folds and cleavages {{that can be used to}} link together the ranges and serve as piercing point which can be used to reconstruct the order and timing of the region. ...|$|R
