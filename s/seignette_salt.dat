50|$|After {{studying}} Physics and Naval engineering, Kurchatov was {{a research}} assistant at the faculty of Physics of the Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute in Baku. Later he researched under Dr. Abram Fedorovich Ioffe at the Physico-Technical Institute on various problems connected with radioactivity.After working {{in a variety of}} research laboratories and the Azerbaijan Polytechnic Institute in Baku for a year, he came to the Leningrad Institute for Physics and Technology (the Russian abbreviation of this famous institution is LFTI) in 1925. Kurchatov’s talent for experimenting and organization was recognized there. His early work was consumed with physics of crystals like dielectric and ferroelectric materials. Kurchatov felt at home with these studies. One of his important results was the discovery of ferroeletric properties of <b>Seignette</b> <b>salt.</b> This discovery earned a degree of doctor of physics and mathematics for him. He was awarded this degree without a dissertation in 1934.. In 1932, he received funding for his own nuclear science research team, which built the Soviet Union's first cyclotron particle accelerator in 1939.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The present work {{is focused}} on the {{electroless}} coating of copper nano-layer onto the surfaces of boron carbide (B 4 C) particle by copper activation method. B 4 C particles with an average size of 18. 25 µm are used in this study. B 4 C particle surfaces were washed by acetone and activated through copper activation method. In the electroless coating bath, copper sulfate, EDTA- 2 Na and <b>seignette</b> <b>salt,</b> hydrazine hydrate were used as the copper catalytic centers source, complexing agent and reducing agent respectively. The structure and morphology of the coating layers were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). XRD and SEM observations show that B 4 C particle surfaces were successfully coated by a homogeneous and continuous copper layer. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{dielectric}} properties of perovskite type crystals {{are of interest}} {{because some of the}} compounds having this crystal structure are ferroelectric. The word ferroelectric is derived by analogy with the word ferromagnetic; it means that the material has a spontaneous electric polarization just as a magnet has a spontaneous magnetic polarization. While in this country the term ferroelectric is universally used, in Europe the term seignettoelectric is often used instead. This usage {{stems from the fact that}} the first ferroelectric discovered was <b>Seignette</b> <b>salt</b> or Rochelle salt. Ferroelectric materials are of interest because they are piezoelectric, they have high dielectric constants, and their dielectric constants are strongly temperature dependent. These properties lead to many applications. A study of the theory of ferroelectrics should be useful in utilizing their properties and in discovering new ferroelectrics...|$|E
50|$|The {{starting}} material is tartar {{with a minimum}} tartaric acid content 68 %. This is first dissolved in water or in the mother liquor of a previous batch. It is then saponified with hot caustic soda to pH 8, decolorized with activated charcoal, and chemically purified before being filtered. The filtrate is evaporated to 42 °Bé at 100 °C, and passed to granulators in which <b>Seignette's</b> <b>salt</b> crystallizes on slow cooling. The salt is separated from the mother liquor by centrifugation, accompanied by washing of the granules, and is dried in a rotary furnace and sieved before packaging. Commercially marketed grain sizes range from 2000 μm to < 250 μm (powder).|$|R
5000|$|Cigarette {{paper is}} made from thin and {{lightweight}} [...] "rag fibers" [...] (nonwood plant fibers) such as flax, hemp, sisal, rice straw, and esparto. The paper is available in rolls and rectangular sheets of varying sizes, and has a narrow strip of glue along one long edge. It may be transparent, colored and flavored. It has a high filler content and a basis weight of 18-28 g/m². To control the smoking properties, this paper has a porosity that is suited {{to the type of}} tobacco and contains additives that regulate burning. One critical paper characteristic is permeability; its primary physical influence is smoke dilution. Among the fillers used are calcium carbonate to influence the permeability and color, magnesium carbonate to improve ash color, or titanium oxide if a particularly white ash is required. Sodium potassium tartrate (<b>Seignette's</b> <b>salt),</b> sodium and potassium citrate are used as a combustion regulator in cigarette paper, increased levels result in faster burning papers. Poly(vinyl alcohol) in aqueous solution is used for cigarette adhesives.|$|R
40|$|Foram examinadas 38 amostras de germens do grupo pullorumgallinarum, de origem européa, {{americana}} ou isoladas no Brasil, acompanhadas bacteriologicamente durante 3 annos, na fixidez de suas propriedades ou na possibilidade de sua transformação dum typo em outro. a) Distinguiram-se no estudo das propriedades cinco typos de germens no grupo pullorumgallinarum - 1) pullorum gazogeno, 2) pullorum não gazogeno, 3) intermedius, 4) gallinarum ou intermedius? gazogeno, 5) gallinarum não gazogeno. Os 2 primeiros e o 5 º já bem cinhecidos e acceitos; o 4 º admittido por Beck & Eber, em 1929, o 3 º evidenciado por nós em 1935. b) O typo gallinarum gazogeno deve ser mais propriamente talvez considerado como typo intermedius gazogeno a vista de sua acção sobre sorbita e a xylose e sobre o meio de Jordan. c) O quadro final resume as caracteristicas mais importantes destes cinco typos, baseando-se a differenciação principalmente na alteração do vermelho neutro, na produção de H²S, na fermentação de glycerina, rhamnose, xylose, dulcita, sorbita e maltose, na acção sobre o tartaro, na producção de gaz e no aspecto das colonias na superficie de certos meios de cultura. d) Outras propriedades biologicas examinadas - acção sobre o leite, sôro de leite, dextrina, etc, admitidos por varios pesquizadores na differenciação, parecem distituidas de valor. e) As amostras mantiveram fixas as suas propriedades durante todo o tempo em que foram acompanhadas. A hypothese de uma possivel transformação de um typo em outro não foi confirmada em nenhuma das amostras estudadas, justificando a entidade dos varios typos admittidos. f) Discrepancias observadas na fermentação da maltose, referidas por varios pesquizadores com germens desse grupo, não foram confirmadas no presente trabalho. g) Encontrou-se no sôro sanguineo um factor capaz de transformar a maltose em glycose, tornando aquelle assucar fermentescivel. Essa substancia é thermo-estavel e resiste á acção de substancias antidiastasicas. h) A analyse sôrologica das amostras estudadas não permittiu differenciar os typos entre si. Thirty eight {{strains of}} microorganisms of the pullorum-gallinarum group, of European, American or Brazilian origin were investigated bacteriologically {{in order to}} ascertain as to the fixity of their properties {{and the possibility of}} transforming a strain in another. a) Five types could be distinguished in our strains: 1 - gasogenic pullorum; 2 - non-gasogenic pullorum; 3 - intermedius; 4 - gasogenic gallinarum?; 5 - non-gasogenic gallinarum. The first, two and fifth types are well known and recognized by specialists; the fourth group has been recognized by Beck & Eber, in 1920; the third group was recognized by ourselves, in 1935. b) The table found in this paper summarizes the most important characteristics of these five types. The changes produced on neutral red, H²S production, fermentation of glycerol, isodulcitol, xylose, dulcite, sorbitol and maltose, the activity upon <b>Seignette</b> <b>salt,</b> gas production and appearance of the colonies, are among the characteristics on which the distinction of these five types is founded. c) The gasogenic gallinarum type, on account of its action on sorbitol and xylose, and also on Jordan's medium, must be rather considered as a gasogenic intermedius type. d) Other biological characteristics, such as activity upon milk, milk-whey, dextrin, etc., accepted by several specialists, appeared as of no practical value to the distinction of the different types of our strains. e) The strains kept their properties invariable during all the time of our investigations. The hypothesis of a possible transformation of one type into another has not been confirmed in any of the studied strains and this justifies the idea of independence of each one of the accepted types. f) Some discrepances in fermentation of maltose as found by several authors in microorganisms of this group, have been not confirmed in this paper. g) In blood horse serum a factor capable of transforming maltose was found making it fermentative. This substance is thermostable and resistent to some antidiastatic substances. h) The serological analysis of the studied strains did not allow a antigenic distinction among the different types of the bacterial group...|$|E
