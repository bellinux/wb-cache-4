5|$|Carey {{began to}} infuse her {{personality}} into her work, something that showed throughout various tracks. During her stay, she {{was influenced by}} the Latin culture, and began harmonizing and singing the music she heard there. When she arrived back to New York, <b>she</b> <b>already</b> <b>had</b> the melody developed, and soon began working on the song in San Francisco with Afanasieff.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Dalton felt {{jealous of}} boys {{for the freedom}} they enjoyed. They could travel alone without {{worrying}} about their reputation and were often bribed to attend school, while girls were, in her opinion, educated reluctantly. One of her teachers {{thought it would be}} wasteful for her to study algebra, as <b>she</b> <b>already</b> <b>had</b> sufficient education for a housewife. As a young woman, she felt that women lived on a higher moral level than men. She saw polygamy as a way to allow more women to marry the few good men, arguing that it gave more women the opportunity to marry. She also considered it ironic that prostitution was tolerated but polygamy was considered depraved.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} nevertheless sent Feynman to Geneva for the September 1958 Atoms for Peace Conference. On {{the beach}} on Lake Geneva, he met Gweneth Howarth, who was from Ripponden, Yorkshire, {{and working in}} Switzerland as an au pair. Feynman's love life had been turbulent since his divorce; his previous girlfriend had walked off with his Albert Einstein Award medal and, {{on the advice of}} an earlier girlfriend, had feigned pregnancy and blackmailed him into paying for an abortion, then used the money to buy furniture. When Feynman found that Howarth was being paid only $25 a month, he offered her $20 a week to be his live-in maid. That this sort of behavior was illegal was not overlooked; Feynman had a friend, Matthew Sands, act as her sponsor. Howarth pointed out that <b>she</b> <b>already</b> <b>had</b> two boyfriends, but eventually decided to take Feynman up on his offer, and arrived in Altadena, California, in June 1959. She made a point of dating other men but Feynman proposed in the spring of 1960. They were married on September 24, 1960, at the Huntington Hotel in Pasadena. They had a son, Carl, in 1962, and adopted a daughter, Michelle, in 1968. Besides their home in Altadena, they had a beach house in Baja California, purchased with the money from Feynman's Nobel Prize.|$|E

25|$|A {{member of}} the Haliwa-Saponi Native American tribe {{recognized}} {{by the state of}} North Carolina, Faith Hedgepeth was born in 1992 in Warren County, part of the tribe's traditional territory. Her parents divorced within a year of her birth, and she was raised by her mother, with help from an older sister, in Hollister and Warrenton. Connie Hedgepeth named her third daughter Faith because she believed that was what she needed to raise a third child when <b>she</b> <b>already</b> <b>had</b> two teenage daughters and a husband with a drug problem.|$|E
25|$|Versions of {{the life}} of young Thaddeus vary. He was the second child in a family of five and was named Thaddeus Sobieski Constantine, more than likely after the {{character}} Thaddeus Constantine Sobieski (Tadeusz Kosciuszko) in an 1803 novel ‘’Thaddeus of Warsaw’’ by Scottish author Jane Porter. It is confused about his life around the age of ten whether his mother had died and Clovis married Mary Randall, or if Lowe was sent away to another farm during which time his mother died and his father remarried. He apparently did work for another farm owned by the Plaisted’s, but whether or not he lived there is uncertain. Clovis and Mary had seven more children, but there is a timeline confusion that may indicate <b>she</b> <b>already</b> <b>had</b> children when she married Clovis.|$|E
500|$|Laurent {{visited the}} set of Asterix and Obelix with her friend and the latter's father. Her acting career began when actor Gérard Depardieu, seeing Laurent there, {{asked her if she}} wanted to be in films. Laurent replied, [...] "Why not?". He {{strongly}} advised her not to take acting classes because he believed <b>she</b> <b>already</b> <b>had</b> the necessary skills. When Laurent was 16, Depardieu gave her a part in The Bridge, a drama he starred in and co-directed with Fréderic Auburtin. Laurent played the role of Lisbeth Daboval, the daughter of one of the protagonists of the film, Claire Daboval.|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Randee St. Nicholas. Underwood said that when she heard first the song, <b>she</b> <b>already</b> <b>had</b> ideas of a possible video for it. She {{wanted it to be}} a dark Wizard of Oz in 2012. It earned her an award for Video of the Year at the 2013 CMT Music Awards. The video was nominated for Music Video of the Year at the 2013 Country Music Association Awards. Underwood has performed [...] "Blown Away" [...] in a number of live appearances, including at the 2012 Billboard Music Awards, the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, and {{two years in a row}} at the Country Music Association Awards. It was also performed as the encore of the Blown Away Tour (2012–13).|$|E
500|$|Perry {{also said}} that her music would be getting [...] "real fucking dark", though also stated that her fans {{would be able to}} relate to it. [...] "I imagine that maybe my next record would {{be a little bit more}} of an artistic venture," [...] she said. [...] "Not that I'm going to self-sabotage either and be like, 'I'm going to make a crazy record that nobody really understands.'" [...] That fall, she later told Billboard about her plans for the album, saying she already envisioned several aspects of it. Perry told the {{magazine}} that <b>she</b> <b>already</b> <b>had</b> songs and ideas, and knew the type of record she would make next. She {{also said that}} although she had not started recording yet, she already knew how the artwork, coloring and tone of the album would turn out. Perry further detailed: [...] "I have to let the music take shape first. I even know what type of tour I'm doing next. I'll be very pleased if the vision I have in my head becomes a reality.

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Blown Away" [...] {{was directed by}} Randee St. Nicholas and produced by Brandon Bonfiglo for Randee St. Nicholas Photography. Underwood said that when she heard first the song, <b>she</b> <b>already</b> <b>had</b> ideas of a possible video for it, and {{wanted it to be}} a dark Wizard of Oz in 2012. The singer deemed it [...] "a visual song. You listen to it and you can see everything that is happening. It's so dramatic. I'm not a drama person, but when you can make a movie in song form in three-and-a-half minutes, it's surreal." [...] A sneak peek of the video was released on June 11, 2012. The music video premiered worldwide on July 30, during a 24-hour exclusive window domestically and internationally on E! News at 7 and 11:30p.m. ET/PT and on the homepage of E! Online.

500|$|On 21 September 1578 Leicester {{secretly}} married Lady Essex at {{his country}} house at Wanstead, {{with only a}} handful of relatives and friends present. He did not dare to tell the Queen of his marriage; nine months later Leicester's enemies at court acquainted her with the situation, causing a furious outburst. <b>She</b> <b>already</b> <b>had</b> been aware of his marriage plans a year earlier, though. Leicester's hope of an heir was fulfilled in 1581 when another Robert Dudley, styled Lord Denbigh, was born. The child died aged three in 1584, leaving his parents disconsolate. Leicester found comfort in God since, as he wrote, [...] "princes ... seldom do pity according to the rules of charity." [...] The Earl {{turned out to be a}} devoted husband: In 1583 the French ambassador, Michel de Castelnau, wrote of [...] "the Earl of Leicester and his lady to whom he is much attached", and [...] "who has much influence over him". Leicester was a concerned parent to his four stepchildren, and in every respect worked for the advancement of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, whom he regarded as his political heir.|$|E
500|$|Just for the Record... was {{released}} on September 24, 1989 by Columbia Records. It includes four discs, with each disc focusing on a different decade ("The 60s Part I", [...] "The 60s Part II", [...] "The 70s", and [...] "The 80s"). It was initially priced at $79.98 USD and by 1994 was the second best-selling box set collection in the United States (behind only Led Zeppelin's 1990 self-titled box set) with approximately 404,000 copies sold. Serving as a retrospective of Streisand's three decade-spanning career, it features several songs from her catalogue in addition to previously unreleased tracks. Her first studio-recorded track ever, a cover of Mack Gordon and Harry Warren's [...] "You'll Never Know" [...] (1943), was featured as the album's opener track and was recorded in 1955. Howard Reich from PopMatters claimed that Streisand's cover proved that <b>she</b> <b>already</b> <b>had</b> had plenty of talent to become a recording artist, despite her young age. Despite the wide array of producers who contributed to the various tracks included in the collection, Streisand and her manager, Martin Erlichman, were credited as the album's two executive producers. In addition to the four discs of material, Just for the Record... includes a 92-page color booklet featuring a variety of photos and artwork created throughout her career.|$|E

2500|$|In Brittany, Duke Conan III {{declared}} his son Hoël a bastard and disinherited {{him on his}} deathbed in 1148. It was his sister Bertha who became Duchess of Brittany making her husband of the time, Eudes, nominally Duke. Hoël had to be satisfied as Count of Nantes. Bertha was the widow of Alan de Bretagne with whom <b>she</b> <b>already</b> <b>had</b> a son, Conan. [...] Conan, who had become Earl of Richmond in 1148, was Henry II's perfect candidate to become the future Duke of Brittany after Bertha, as any Duke with possessions of importance in England {{would be easier to}} control as they are directly a vassal of the English King.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of this eclectic early career, she widened her circle of friends and {{contacts}} beyond those in society and politics with whom <b>she</b> <b>already</b> <b>had</b> close connections. As one of Anthony Eden's biographers put it, she was [...] "equally at home in the worlds of Hatfield and Fitzrovia", while a reviewer of her memoir wrote that [...] "few lives can have touched so many social worlds, or graced them so elegantly". Even so, Lady Avon did not impress everyone: after the future Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher met her at a Conservative Party ball in 1954, she wrote dismissively to her sister, [...] "Mrs Anthony Eden received us. Really she is a most colourless personality".|$|E

He said, [...] "This girl will bring glory to our family. It's a pity that she isn't a boy!" [...] When Wang Yuanji was 12, her grandfather died and she cried her heart out. Her father respected her even more after that incident and felt that she was indeed very special.|$|E
