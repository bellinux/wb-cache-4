500|$|The {{advertising}} {{calls of}} both crakes are readily {{distinguished from the}} quite dissimilar calls of potentially sympatric rails such as the spotted crake, <b>striped</b> <b>crake,</b> Baillon's crake, or water rail. The calls of the two Crex species cannot be confused, since the corn crake is silent in Africa. Both sexes may give distinctive territorial or alarm calls, and females and chicks communicate with cheeps and wheezes. The African crake can be attracted to within [...] of a human by imitation of its kraaa threat call, and the male corn crake by mechanical imitations of their advertising call, including rubbing {{a piece of wood}} down a notched stick, or by flicking a credit card against a comb or zip-fastener.|$|E

5|$|A smallish crake, the African crake has brown-streaked blackish upperparts, bluish-grey underparts and {{black-and-white}} barring on {{the flanks}} and belly. It has a stubby red bill, red eyes, {{and a white}} line from the bill to above the eye. It is smaller than its closest relative, the corn crake; that species is also lighter-plumaged, and has an eye <b>stripe.</b> The African <b>crake</b> has a range of calls, the most characteristic being a series of rapid grating krrr notes. It is active during the day, and is territorial on both the breeding and non-breeding grounds; the male has a threat display, and may fight at territory boundaries. The nest is a shallow cup of grass leaves built in a depression under a grass tussock or small bush. The 3â€“11 eggs start hatching after about 14 days, and the black, downy precocial chicks fledge after four to five weeks. The African crake feeds {{on a wide range}} of invertebrates, along with some small frogs and fish, and plant material, especially grass seeds. It may itself be eaten by large birds of prey; snakes; or mammals, including humans, and can host parasites. Although it may be displaced temporarily by the burning of grassland, or permanently by agriculture, wetland drainage or urbanisation, its large range and population mean that it is not considered to be threatened.|$|R

50|$|The <b>striped</b> <b>crake</b> (Aenigmatolimnas marginalis) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Rallidae. It is the only species in the genus Aenigmatolimnas, having {{formerly}} been included in Porzana or in the defunct genus Poliolimnas. Its precise relationships, however, are still enigmatic.|$|E
50|$|M. inepta {{is indeed}} {{closely related to}} Amaurornis, but not as close as to warrant {{inclusion}} therein. Rather, {{it is part of}} a group including the core group of the polyphyletic Amaurornis, as well as the monotypic genera Aenigmatolimnas (<b>striped</b> <b>crake),</b> Gallicrex (Watercock) and Himantornis (Nkulengu rail). Most of these rails occur in tropical Asia. The Nkulengu rail from the tropical rainforests of Africa is particularly interesting with regard to the New Guinea flightless rail, as its habitat is quite similar but it is so much unlike other rails to have been separated as a distinct subfamily in earlier times. Instead, these two species seem to be ancient divergences that independently expanded westwards and southeastwards from the group's ancestral range, and diverged strongly in some aspects, while otherwise adapting in similar ways.|$|E
5000|$|Conversely, the White-browed crake [...] - [...] {{sometimes}} {{placed in}} Porzana too [...] - [...] {{was moved to}} Amaurornis when its alternate genus Poliolimnas was abolished. Regardless, {{it seems to be}} reasonably close to the <b>striped</b> <b>crake,</b> formerly also in Poliolimnas (or Porzana) but subsequently separated as Aenigmatolimnas. Their relationship with each other and the core group of Amaurornis is not yet resolved, so Aenigmatolimnas might eventually also be abolished in favor of Amaurornis, or Poliolimnas might be re-established. Furthermore, the molecular data also confirm the distinctness of Megacrex. More surprisingly, the Amaurornithina are found to contain two singular and monotypic genera, formerly held to be quite distinct from Amaurornis, namely Gallicrex (Watercock) and Himantornis (Nkulengu rail). The former was traditionally considered a more terrestrial member of the moorhens, and the latter even treated as a subfamily of its own.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{molecular}} phylogenetic analyses {{have confirmed}} the suspicion, {{raised in the}} late 20th century in the first cladistic studies of morphology, that the [...] "genus" [...] Porzana is rather an evolutionary grade, consisting of an assemblage of unrelated plesiomorphic rails. The striped and white-browed crakes (and sometimes the yellow-breasted crake) were sometimes united in Poliolimnas as they appear to share some apomorphies. As they are widely allopatric, their similarities are more likely convergent evolution, and they are now moved to a monotypic genus Aenigmatolimnas (<b>striped</b> <b>crake)</b> and included in Amaurornis (white-browed crake). This may, however, be premature, as Amaurornis seems polyphyletic itself. Similarly, Micropygia is maintained as monotypic genus for the ocellated crake until its relationships are fully resolved. The ash-throated crake, which was only tentatively placed in Porzana, has been united with the two former species of Neocrex in Mustelirallus; they are almost certainly closely related to Pardirallus.|$|E
50|$|Like other rails, the Crex {{species have}} {{a wide range of}} vocalisations. The males of both crakes have a loud {{territorial}} and advertising call consisting of a series of grating notes repeated {{two or three times a}} second for several minutes. The male stands upright with his neck extended when advertising, with its head and neck almost vertical and bill wide open. Calling is most frequent early in the breeding season, mainly at night for the corn crake, but in the day for its African cousin. The corn crake's call may be repeated more than 20,000 times a night, with a peak between midnight and 3 am.The advertising calls of both crakes are readily distinguished from the quite dissimilar calls of potentially sympatric rails such as the spotted crake, <b>striped</b> <b>crake,</b> Baillon's crake, or water rail. The calls of the two Crex species cannot be confused, since the corn crake is silent in Africa. Both sexes may give distinctive territorial or alarm calls, and females and chicks communicate with cheeps and wheezes. The African crake can be attracted to within 10 m of a human by imitation of its kraaa threat call, and the male corn crake by mechanical imitations of their advertising call, including rubbing a piece of wood down a notched stick, or by flicking a credit card against a comb or zip-fastener.|$|E
