40|$|Graduation date: 2003 In {{the present}} study, the {{potential}} of low-melting point lipids, namely methyl palmitate (MP) and menhaden stearine (MS), were studied for delivery of water-soluble materials to fish larvae. Addition of the solid emulsifier, sorbitan monopalmitate (SMP) resulted in higher RE compared to the liquid emulsifier <b>sorbitan</b> <b>sesquioleate</b> (SSO). Additions of SMP {{were found to have}} a positive effect on the stability of lipid spray beads (LSB) at concentrations > 10...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of drug concentration, oil phase, and surfactants {{on the characteristics}} of dexamethasone-loaded nanocapsules was investigated. The best formulations were obtained at dexamethasone concentrations of 0. 25 and 0. 50 mg. mL- 1 (encapsulation efficiency: 80 - 90 %; mean size: 189 - 253 nm). The type of oil phase influenced only the stability of dexamethasone-loaded nanocapsules. The association of polysorbate 80 and sorbitan monooleate provided a more stable formulation. Sunflower oil and <b>sorbitan</b> <b>sesquioleate</b> used {{for the first time as}} oil phase and surfactant for nanocapsules, respectively, have allowed obtaining suspensions with low mean size and narrow size distribution...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{distribution}} of three fluorescent drug or drug-like molecules in enteric microparticles. Microparticles were prepared using the pH-responsive methylmethacrylate polymer Eudragit L by an emulsion solvent evaporation process. In the process drug and polymer are dissolved in ethanol, and dispersed in a liquid paraffin external phase using <b>sorbitan</b> <b>sesquioleate</b> as stabiliser. The incorporation and distribution of riboflavin, dipyridamole and acridine orange into these microparticles were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The influence of the physicochemical properties of the molecules (solubility in the inner phase, partition coefficient [ethanol/paraffin]) on the distribution, encapsulation efficiency and pH-responsive dissolution behaviour of the microparticles were examined. The drug that tended to partition in ethanol rather than liquid paraffin (riboflavin) was efficiently encapsulated and evenly distributed. In contrast, compounds which partitioned in favour of the liquid paraffin localised towards the surface of the microparticles and exhibited lower encapsulation efficiency (dipyridamole and acridine orange). All three sets of drug-loaded microparticles showed a limited release in acid (< 10 % release); drug distribution appeared to have a minimum effect on drug release. This microparticle technology has the potential to provide effective enteric drug release with a wide variety of molecules...|$|E
40|$|Acrylic enteric microparticles for oral drug {{delivery}} were prepared by an oil-in-oil emulsion solvent evaporation process. The novel use of <b>sorbitan</b> <b>sesquioleate</b> as a surfactant produced Eudragit L 55, L and S (pH thresholds of 5. 5, 6 and 7, respectively) microparticles of good morphology (spherical, smooth surfaced), size (< 100 Î¼m) and size uniformity. The process was efficient (yield approximately 90 %) and the encapsulated model drug (prednisolone) {{was in the}} amorphous form. The Eudragit L and S microparticles showed excellent pH-responsive drug release in dissolution studies (negligible drug release at pH 1. 2; rapid drug release above the polymers' pH thresholds). In contrast, Eudragit L 55 particles aggregated in fluid and showed poor control of drug release. In vivo in rats, Eudragit L microparticles released their drug load rapidly (Tmax < 1 h) and the Cmax and AUC were {{higher than those of}} a control suspension of prednisolone. Drug absorption from Eudragit S microparticles was low which was attributed {{to the fact that the}} threshold pH of Eudragit S was not reached in the rat intestine and drug release was therefore incomplete. It was concluded that although the rat is an inappropriate model for the investigation of Eudragit S microparticles, the positive results seen with the Eudragit L microparticles indicate its potential use in pH-targeted {{drug delivery}}...|$|E
40|$|Background and Design: The allergens {{responsible}} for {{allergic contact dermatitis}} vary among countries and even between different geographical regions within the same country over time. It is of great importance to perform the patch test at certain intervals, to evaluate the results in different centers and to compare them afterwards. Our aim was to evaluate the patch test results in our patients with allergic contact dermatitis. Material and Method: The records of the patients with allergic contact dermatitis, who had been patch tested between May 1997 and March 2009, were analyzed retrospectively. The demographic features such as age and sex, localization of the contact dermatitis, and the patch test results were recorded. Results: Of the 775 patients, 581 (75. 2 %) were females and 194 (25 %) males. Of all patients, 735 were patch tested with the European Standard Series, 318 - with both the European Standard Series and cosmetic series, and 40 -with cosmetic series alone. Of the patients tested with the European Standard Series, 255 (34. 7 %) {{had at least one}} positive reaction. The most frequent allergen in the European Standard Series was nickel sulfate (17. 3 %), followed by cobalt chloride (7. 2 %), potassium dichromate (3 %), fragrance mix (2. 9 %), and p-phenylenediamine base (2. 6 %). Of the 358 patients tested with cosmetic series, 82 (22. 9 %) had at least one positive reaction. The 5 most frequently observed cosmetic series allergens were octyl gallate (3. 9 %), thimerosal (2. 2 %), <b>sorbitan</b> <b>sesquioleate</b> (2 %), Euxyl K 400 (2 %) and methyldibromo glutaronitrile (1. 4 %). Conclusion: Our study shows the contact allergen profile of our center over 12 years. The most common allergens and their frequency differ between centers in various cities in Turkey. Those geographical differences should be re-evaluated by further studies performed in the certain time period. The high frequency of reactions to octyl gallate is an important finding in patients suspected of cosmetic allergy and who underwent patch testing with cosmetic series...|$|E
