50|$|The new M102 was {{substantially}} lighter, weighing {{little more}} than 1½ tons whereas the M101A1 weighed approximately 2½ tons; as a result, more ammunition could be carried during heliborne operations, and a 3/4-ton truck rather than a 2½-ton truck was its prime mover for ground operations. Another major advantage of the M102 was {{that it could be}} traversed a full 6,400 mils; the M101A1 had a limited on-carriage traverse, which required its trails (<b>stabilizing</b> <b>legs)</b> to be shifted if further traverse was necessary. The M102 fires the same semi-fixed ammunition as the M101, but its longer barrel (32 calibres versus 22 calibres on M101) allows a slightly higher muzzle velocity and thus enhanced firing range. A low silhouette made the new weapon a more difficult target for the enemy, an advantage that far outweighed the disadvantage of being somewhat less convenient to load.|$|E

As Krumrie came off {{a block from}} 49er offensive linemen Jesse Sapolu and Randy Cross, he went to make a tackle on ballcarrier Roger Craig. When his foot was planted in the ground, the pressure his weight put on his ankle joint caused his lower leg to snap above the joint.

40|$|Humans can robustly locomote over complex terrains {{even while}} {{simultaneously}} attending to other {{tasks such as}} accurate foot placement on the ground. We investigated whether subjects would exploit motor redundancy across the joints of the <b>leg</b> to <b>stabilize</b> overall limb kinematics when presented with a hopping task that constrained foot placement position. Subjects hopped in place on one leg (2. 2 Hz) while having to place their foot into one of three target sizes upon landing (0. 250, 0. 063, 0. 010 m 2). As takeoff and landing angles are critical to this task performance, we hypothesized smaller target sizes would increase the need to stabilize (i. e., make more consistent) the leg orientation through motor equivalent combinations of segment angles. As it was not critical to the targeting task, we hypothesized no changes for leg length stabilization across target size. With smaller target sizes, we saw total segment angle variance increase due to greater signal-dependent noise {{associated with an increased}} activation of leg extensor muscles (medial and lateral gastrocnemius, vastus medialis, vastus lateralis and rectus femoris). At smaller target sizes, more segment angle variance was aligned to kinematic deviations with the goal of maintaining leg orientation trajectory. We also observed a decrease in the variance structure for <b>stabilizing</b> <b>leg</b> length at the smallest target conditions. This trade-off effect is explained by the nearly orthogonal relationship between the two goal-equivalent manifolds for leg length vs. leg orientation stabilization.

The foot is adducted and plantar-flexed at the subtalar joint, and {{the goal is to}} abduct the foot and dorsiflex it. In order to achieve correction of the clubfoot, the calcaneus should be allowed to rotate freely under the talus bone, which also is free to rotate in the ankle mortise. The correction takes place through the normal arc of the subtalar joint. This is achieved by placing the index finger of the operator on the medial malleolus to <b>stabilize</b> the <b>leg</b> and levering on the thumb placed on the lateral aspect head of the talus while abducting the forefoot in supination. Forcible attempts at correcting the heel varus by abducting the forefoot while applying counter pressure at the calcaneocuboid joint prevents the calcaneus from abducting and therefore everting.|$|R

50|$|As {{one of the}} {{earliest}} cynodonts, Procynosuchus has many primitive features, but it also has features that distinguish it from all other early therapsids. Some of these features have been interpreted as adaptations for a semi-aquatic lifestyle. For example, the wide zygapophyses of the vertebrae allow for a high degree of lateral flexibility, and Procynosuchus may have used anguilliform locomotion, or eel-like undulation, to swim through the water. The tail of Procynosuchus is also unusually long for a cynodont. The long haemal arches would have given the tail a large lateral surface area for greater propulsion through the water. Relatively flat foot bones may also have been an adaptation toward swimming, as the feet may have been used like paddles. Ridges on the femur are an indication of strong flexor muscles that could have <b>stabilized</b> the <b>leg</b> during limb-driven swimming. When the thigh is pulled back in the water, the lower leg tends to bend forward. Strong flexor muscles would have pulled the lower leg back with the femur, providing the powerful backward thrust that is needed to swim.|$|R

Research completed at the Department of Human Performance Studies, College of EducationRecent epidemiological data on U. S. cheerleaders suggest that injuries {{are on the rise}} and the majority of injuries sustained are strains/sprains of the lower extremities. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate possible neuromuscular factors contributing to injury rates in collegiate-level cheerleaders. Six female collegiate cheerleaders volunteered for this study. Participants underwent isokinetic muscular strength assessment of the knee flexors and extensors using an Isokinetic Dynamometer. The tests show that cheerleaders should increase their focus on conditioning and strength-training of the lower extremities to help avoid thigh- and knee-related injuries. Cheerleading has become an extremely competitive sport over the last decade. Recent epidemiological data on U. S. cheerleaders suggest the majority of injuries sustained during cheerleading were strains/sprains of the lower extremities. Muscular weakness/ imbalances have been proposed as potential factors related to these types of injuries. PURPOSE: To investigate and identify possible neuromuscular factors contributing to injury rates in collegiate-level cheerleaders. METHODS: Six female collegiate cheerleaders (mean ± SD, age: 19. 2 ± 1. 3 yrs, height: 1. 61 ± 0. 07 m, weight: 56. 3 ± 3. 9 kg) who were members of the Nationals competition team for their university volunteered for this study. Participants underwent concentric isokinetic muscular strength assessment using the Biodex Isokinetic Dynamometer. The motor axis of the dynamometer was visually aligned with the axis of the knee joint of first the <b>stabilizing</b> <b>leg</b> (right) and then the stunt leg (left). The knee joint was adjusted so the leg was fully extended (knee angle = 0 degrees) to avoid hyperextension of the joint. After a standardized warm-up consisting of five submaximal concentric muscle actions, the quadriceps and hamstring muscles were tested at a velocity of 60 °·s- 1 for peak torque and subsequent analysis of the hamstrings-to-quadriceps (H:Q) ratio. RESULTS: No differences in quadriceps (p= 0. 371) (right leg: 111. 1 ± 28. 2 N·m, left leg: 105. 5 ± 35. 8 N·m) or hamstrings (p= 0. 098) (right: 62. 2 ± 14. 2 N·m, left: 56. 4 ± 15. 2 N·m) peak torque were observed between legs. The H:Q ratios were 0. 54 ± 0. 07 and 0. 53 ± 0. 04 for right and left legs, respectively. CONCLUSION: Although the current findings did not demonstrate any significant contralateral strength imbalances between legs, the results did reveal H:Q ratios below the proposed normative value of 0. 6. Thus, cheerleaders should increase their focus on conditioning and strength-training of the lower extremities to help avoid thigh- and knee-related injuries.

40|$|Abstract-Functional neuromuscular {{stimulation}} (FNS) of paralyzed muscles {{has enabled}} spinal-cord-injured patients to regain {{a semblance of}} lower-extremity control, for example to ambulate while relying heavily {{on the use of}} walkers. Given the limitations of FNS, specifically low muscle strengths, high rates of fatigue, and a limited ability to modulate muscle excitations, it remains unclear, however, whether FNS can be developed as a practical means to control the lower extremity musculature to restore aesthetic, unsupported gait to paraplegics. A computer simulation of FNS-assisted bipedal gait shows that it is difficult, but possible to attain undisturbed, level gait at normal speeds provided the electrically-stimulated ankle plantarflexors exhibit either near-normal strengths or are augmented by an orthosis, and at least seven muscle-groups in each leg are stimulated. A combination of dy-namic programming and an open-loop, trial-and-error adjustment process was used to find a suboptimal set of discretely-varying muscle stimulation patterns needed for a 3 -D, 8 degree-of-freedom dynamic model to sustain a step. An ankle-foot orthosis was found to be espe-cially useful, as it helped to <b>stabilize</b> the stance <b>leg</b> and simplified the task of controlling the foot during swing.

40|$|In {{disaster}} situations, humanoid robots offer {{many advantages}} as first responders, but must often navigate rough and unstable terrain. The high {{center of mass}} and small support polygon of humanoids creates a difficult locomotion challenge. However, a humanoid that can transform into a quadruped for locomotion, such as MIT Biomimetic Robotics Lab's HERMES, adds the stability of a four-legged gait to safely traverse this dangerous landscape. This thesis investigates a trotting gait controller for use on HERMES specifically on rough terrain. The method takes advantage of simpler underlying dynamics of trotting stability to create a robust controller that performs without specific knowledge of the terrain or preplanning steps. Force and moment balance are conducted around the center of mass of the robot and ground reaction forces from the feet. Stance <b>legs</b> <b>stabilize</b> against disturbances in pitch, roll, and center of mass height. Swing legs attempt to land in the optimal position using a ZMP technique, and the gait cycle time is modulated to achieve stability irrespective of the foot placement constrained by the actual terrain.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the issue of {{etiology}} and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It has been proved that the locomotor system affects occurrence of this disease in many aspects therefore, apart from the primary care of gastroenterologists and general practitioners, treatment using physiotherapeutic techniques becomes significant. Sphincter mechanism {{at the lower end of}} the oesophagus being the most important anti-reflux barrier in terms of function is described in the theoretical part in detail. Possible ways and factors involved in occurrence of gastroesophageal reflux and then current treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease are mentioned. The other part of the theoretical part is aimed at: relations between the internal organs and locomotor system, the diaphragm function and its relation to occurrence of GERD, and possibilities of rehabilitation treatment of patients with this disease. The goal of the theoretical part was to provide a research on the current situation. The practical part was prepared by means of a qualitative research. The tested set consisted of three patients diagnosed with GERD being treated at the Gastroenterological Ward in České Budějovice Hospital. Patients? anamneses were taken and kinesiological testing was done. Similarly, all three patients were identified with a disorder of trunk stabilization. Upon this, individual therapies were proposed and carried out, which was the goal of the practical part, too. Physiotherapy was aimed at: affecting the position of the rib cage and improving its dynamics while breathing, training of breathing stereotype, activation of the abdominal wall, affecting the <b>stabilizing</b> function of <b>legs,</b> exercises in developmental series and modified positions, Jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation, and affecting reflexive changes using soft techniques. The research issue was whether the symptoms of GERD could be affected by treatment of functional disorders of the locomotor system in a positive way. There were certain changes in the kinesiological testing (e. g. change in the activity of lower and upper fixators of scapulae with relaxation of the trapezius, releasing the rigidity of the chest, affecting the dynamic stability of the body) during a three-month therapy. However, functional disorders were not affected that much so any described symptoms of GERD could be changed. The results of the therapy were limited by motivation, attitude and patients? metal state. Not only the internal organ but also the locomotor system probably plays a role in occurrence of the reflux; but also psyche, and all these parts of a human being affect each other. Therefore the treatment of a multifactorial disease such as GERD should be comprehensive. Apart from physiotherapy, metal area, too, and all factors should be treated at the same time, which requires interdisciplinary cooperation unfortunately lagging behind...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} study proposes a multi-sensor data fusion technique {{to determine the}} complex interactions between the sensory, muscular and mechanical components of the human locomotor systems (neuromechanics). The object in this work is to demonstrate the viability in using inertial sensors for accurate gait phase determination and to present the acceleration effect specific body segment contributes {{in order to establish}} a functional gait. The current method used in determining gait phases consist of combining ground reaction force and angular data, this method is time consuming and cannot be totally reliable. We found out that gait phases can be determined distinctively by measuring vertical and horizontal accelerations (X-Y) in the sagittal plane on the foot. The foot acceleration graph show 98 % unique consistency in determining the seven gait phases, during the experiment when the subjects were walking at normal; fast; even running. Note that this foot acceleration pattern was accurate for three consecutive experiments carried out on three different days under the same experimental conditions. Although the shank, thigh and hip acceleration showed uniqueness in determining the gait phases when the subjects were walking at normal speed, we discovered irregularities in the graph pattern when the subjects were running. For 132 lbs, 5. 6 ft male subject walking at 0. 9 m/s we noticed that the highest negative acceleration (- 0. 460 g, foot y-direction in the sagittal plane) occurred at heel strike and {{this is due to the}} slowing down of the muscles as the <b>leg</b> <b>stabilizes</b> from the swing phase of the sagittal plane. The corresponding vertical acceleration was 1. 226 g with a vertical ground reaction force of 24 N. As the right leg transitions from heel strike to toe off, a maximum ground reaction force of 619 N was detected. At toe-off maximum positive acceleration in the foot y-direction was recorded (0. 327 g) corresponding to the second highest peek of the vertical acceleration (x-direction 0. 311 g). We also found out that the only lowest negative acceleration in the vertical plane occurred at the cross over (initial swing) as the foot leaves the ground and the hip flexor muscles are activated to accelerate the leg forward. ^ In total six able bodied subjects were involved in this research (four male and two female). The experiment was performed using rate gyroscopes and linear accelerometers attached to the right hip, right thigh, right knee, right shank, right ankle and right foot. The assumption in this work is that walking pattern in able-bodied people is symmetrical, thus we assume the same acceleration conditions and gait phases detections as well is symmetrical. The subjects were allowed to walked at their normal walking speeds, however, for comparison in some cases all subjects walked at 0. 9 m/s and 1. 08 m/s. The experiment lasted for 120 s when the subjects walked on an instrumented treadmill and the setup was synchronized with ground reaction force sensor, and Simi motion capture system. The sampling frequency was 280 Hz for all four sensing technologies. When the subjects walked over ground, the experiments lasted for about 5 sec. Outputs from the sensors were fed into fuzzy inference system, where the concept of fuzzy similarity was applied to determined the coordinated walking pattern for each subject (CWP). ...|$|R
