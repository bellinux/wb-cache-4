50|$|<b>Wind</b> <b>throw</b> is the {{toppling}} {{of a tree}} due to {{the force}} of the wind, this exposes the root plate and adjacent soil beneath the tree and influences slope stability. <b>Wind</b> <b>throw</b> is factor when considering one tree on a slope, however it is of lesser importance when considering general slope stability for a body of trees as the wind forces involved represent a smaller percentage of the potential disturbing forces and the trees which are in the centre of the group will be sheltered by those on the outside.|$|R

5000|$|The Aerobie {{allows for}} throws over unusually long distances. It flies faster and farther than a common flying disc. When well tuned, it can fly in a {{straight}} line, [...] "like a puck on an invisible sheet of ice". It {{does not have the}} tendency to roll when thrown level, as a flying disc does. But similarly to a disc, an Aerobie can be thrown in a curved path by throwing it in a slant. Its lift depends on its speed relative to the air. Therefore, <b>throwing</b> into the <b>wind</b> makes it fly higher. <b>Throwing</b> with the <b>wind</b> makes it fly lower.|$|R

40|$|The {{exchange}} {{of carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) between the atmosphere and a forest after disturbance by <b>wind</b> <b>throw</b> in the western Russian taiga was investigated between July and October 1998 using the eddy covariance technique. The research area was a regenerating forest (400 m x 1000 m), in which all trees of the preceding generation were uplifted during a storm in 1996. All deadwood had remained on site after the storm and had not been extracted for commercial purposes. Because of the heterogeneity of the terrain, several micrometeorological quality tests were applied. In addition to the eddy covariance measurements, carbon pools of decaying wood in a chronosequence of three different <b>wind</b> <b>throw</b> areas were analysed and the decay rate of coarse woody debris was derived. During daytime, the average CO 2 uptake flux was - 3 mumol m(- 2) s(- 1), whereas during night-time characterised by a well-mixed atmosphere the rates of release were typically about 6 mumol m(- 2) s(- 1). Suppression of turbulent fluxes was only observed under conditions with very low friction velocity (u * {{less than or equal}} to 0. 08 ms(- 1)). On average, 164 mmol CO 2 m(- 2) d(- 1) was released from the <b>wind</b> <b>throw</b> to the atmosphere, giving a total of 14. 9 mol CO 2 m(- 2) (180 g CO 2 m(- 2)) released during the 3 -month study period. The chronosequence of dead woody debris on three different <b>wind</b> <b>throw</b> areas suggested exponential decay with a decay coefficient of - 0. 04 yr(- 1). From the magnitude of the carbon pools and the decay rate, it is estimated that the decomposition of coarse woody debris accounted for about a third of the total ecosystem respiration at the measurement site. Hence, coarse woody debris had a long- term influence on the net ecosystem {{exchange of}} this <b>wind</b> <b>throw</b> area. From the analysis performed in this work, a conclusion is drawn that it is necessary to include into flux networks the ecosystems that are subject to natural disturbances and that have been widely omitted into considerations of the global carbon budget. The half-life time of about 17 years for deadwood in the <b>wind</b> <b>throw</b> suggests a fairly long storage of carbon in the ecosystem, and indicates a very different long- term carbon budget for naturally disturbed vs. commercially managed forests...|$|R

40|$|<b>Wind</b> <b>throw</b> is an {{important}} risk factor in forest management in North-western Europe. In recent years, mechanistic models {{have been developed to}} estimate critical wind speeds needed to break or uproot the average tree of a forest stand. Based on these models, we developed a wind damage module for the individual tree model ForGEM (Forest Genetics, Ecology and Management). For a given wind speed this module assesses the forces on each individual tree, based on the tree dimensions, and support and sheltering provided by other trees. Due to this individual approach, irregular stands can also be assessed. The module is demonstrated on Douglas fir stands (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) of different densities in the Netherlands. Patterns of damage are explained, both in freshly exposed stands as well as in sheltered stands. Wind speeds needed to cause damage approximated those of known <b>wind</b> <b>throw</b> events. The <b>wind</b> damage module proved to be very sensitive to simulated tree heights and diameters. Furthermore, the newly introduced support mechanism played {{an important}} role in the stability of trees and stands. Lower individual tree stability in dense stands was clearly compensated for by the support of other trees...|$|R

30|$|Climate regulates {{tree species}} {{composition}} {{at the regional}} level; however, {{at the local level}} site-specific factors (e.g. forest fires, <b>wind</b> <b>throw,</b> topography, soil characteristics, interspecific competition and successional stage) mostly overrule the importance of regional climate (Pearson and Dawson 2003; Körner et al. 2016; Kuosmanen et al. 2016).|$|R

This we did with the ship's head to the westward, without touching a brace, though we luffed sufficiently to <b>throw</b> the <b>wind</b> {{out of all the}} square sails.

6000|$|Still bent on {{discovering}} some {{method of}} [...] "raising the wind," [...] Mr Williams appealed to his inventive powers. He considered {{that if a}} pump threw water, {{there was no reason}} why it should not <b>throw</b> <b>wind.</b> Impressed with this belief, he set to work and made a box about eighteen or twenty inches square and four feet high, with a valve in the bottom to let air in, a hole in the front to let it out, and a sort of piston to force it through the hole. By means of a long lever the piston could be raised, and by heavy weights it was pushed down. Of course considerable power was required to raise the piston and its weights, but there was a superabundance of power, for thousands of wondering natives were ready and eager to do whatever they were bid. They could have pumped the bellows had they been the size of a house! They worked admirably in some respects, but had the same fault as the first pair, namely, a tendency to suck in the fire! This, however, was corrected by means of a valve {{at the back of the}} pipe which communicated with the fire. Another fault lay in the length of interval between the blasts. This was remedied by making another box of the same kind, and working the two alternately, so that when one was blowing the fire, the other was, as it were, taking breath. Thus a continuous blast was obtained, while eight or ten grinning and delighted natives worked the levers.|$|R
