5000|$|For broadcasting, mast {{radiators}} are {{the most}} common type of antenna used, consisting of a steel lattice guyed mast in which the mast structure itself is used as the antenna. Stations broadcasting with low power can use masts with heights of a quarter-wavelength (about 310 millivolts per meter using one kilowatt at one kilometer) to 5/8 wavelength (225 electrical degrees; about 440 millivolts per meter using one kilowatt at one kilometer), while high power stations mostly use half-wavelength to 5/9 wavelength. The usage of masts taller than 5/9 wavelength (200 electrical degrees; about 410 millivolts per meter using one kilowatt at one kilometer) with high power gives a poor vertical radiation pattern, and 195 electrical degrees (about 400 millivolts per meter using one kilowatt at one kilometer) is generally considered ideal in these cases. Usually mast antennas are series-excited (base driven); the feedline is attached to the mast at the base. The base of the antenna is at high electrical potential and must be supported on a ceramic insulator to isolate it from the ground. Shunt-excited masts, in which the base of the mast is at a node of the standing wave at ground potential and so does not need to be insulated from the ground, have fallen into disuse, except in cases of exceptionally high power, 1 MW or more, where <b>series</b> <b>excitation</b> might be impractical. If grounded masts or towers are required, cage or long-wire aerials are used. Another possibility consists of feeding the mast or the tower by cables running from the tuning unit to the guys or crossbars at a certain height.|$|E

40|$|This study explores a {{structural}} damage detection strategy employing the novel use of chaotic time <b>series</b> <b>excitation.</b> Chaotic time series have several useful properties such as determinism and controllable dimension. Therefore, these series are attractive candidates for probing a structure’s dynamics for the subtle changes that could occur because of damage. This approach {{is applied to}} a metal frame structure connected by bolted joints. Under loading, fatigue damage causes the pre-loads in the bolts to lessen, leading to an increasing inability of the joint to accommodate design loads. This project explores the use of propagating chaotic waveforms through the frame structure and to determine a diagnostic parameter that reflects the structural health of the bolted joints. Analysis of vibration response to chaotic input is used to detect the extent and location of pre-load loss. Using the cross-prediction error as a feature for damage detection was successful in identifying damage and, using excitation to response prediction errors, locating damage. However, in other cross comparisons of attractors, the prediction error {{was not able to}} locate the damage. In addition, the extent of damage was not correlated with the magnitude of prediction error.
