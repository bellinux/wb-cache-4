5|$|In 1994, the Indonesian <b>Sumatran</b> <b>Tiger</b> Conservation Strategy {{addressed}} the potential crisis that tigers faced in Sumatra. The <b>Sumatran</b> <b>Tiger</b> Project (STP) was initiated in June 1995 {{in and around}} the Way Kambas National Park in order to ensure the long-term viability of wild Sumatran tigers and to accumulate data on tiger life-history characteristics vital for the management of wild populations. By August 1999, the teams of the STP had evaluated 52 sites of potential tiger habitat in Lampung Province, of which only 15 these were intact enough to contain tigers. In the framework of the STP a community-based conservation programme was initiated to document the tiger-human dimension in the park in order to enable conservation authorities to resolve tiger-human conflicts based on a comprehensive database rather than anecdotes and opinions.|$|E
5|$|Results of craniological {{analysis}} of 111 tiger skulls from Southeast Asian range countries indicate that <b>Sumatran</b> <b>tiger</b> skulls differ from Indochinese and Javan tiger skulls, whereas Bali tiger skulls {{are similar in}} size to Javan tiger skulls. The authors proposed to classify Sumatran and Javan tiger as distinct species, P. sumatrae and P. sondaica with Bali tiger as subspecies P. sondaica balica.|$|E

5|$|In 2015, morphological, {{ecological}} and molecular traits of all putative tiger subspecies were analysed in a combined approach. Results support distinction {{of the two}} evolutionary groups continental and Sunda tigers. The authors proposed recognition of only two subspecies, namely Panthera tigris tigris comprising the Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese, South Chinese, Siberian and Caspian tiger populations, and Panthera tigris sondaica comprising the Javan, Bali and <b>Sumatran</b> <b>tiger</b> populations. The authors also noted that this reclassification will affect tiger conservation management.|$|E
25|$|On 20 June 2008, SpongeBob FlyPants opened {{as part of}} Nick Central. On 9 June, Tiger Island {{welcomed the}} birth of three <b>Sumatran</b> <b>Tiger</b> cubs: Ndari, Jaya and Shanti.|$|E
25|$|Tigers {{of three}} {{different}} subspecies are found {{on the island of}} Sumatra (the <b>Sumatran</b> <b>tiger),</b> in peninsular Malaysia (the Malayan tiger), and in Indochina (the Indochinese tiger); all of which are endangered species.|$|E

25|$|In May 2012, Mandelson {{confirmed}} {{that he was}} advising Asia Pulp & Paper (APP) in selling timber products to Europe. In 2012 APP was accused of illegal logging in Indonesia and damaging the habitats of rare animals such as the <b>Sumatran</b> <b>tiger.</b> At least 67 companies worldwide, such as Tesco and Kraft Foods since 2004 and Danone since 2012 have boycotted APP.|$|E
25|$|On January 24, 2014, the zoo's 10-year-old female lion, Nababiep, {{gave birth}} to three cubs in an eight-hour period. Two of the cubs survived, and were the first lion cub litter born at the zoo in four years, the third for Nababiep, and the fourth for the eight-year-old father, Luke. The birth {{followed}} the birth of two rare <b>Sumatran</b> <b>tiger</b> cubs to mother Damai on August 5, 2013. There are also two exhibits for bobcats and caracals.|$|E
25|$|In April 2007, two <b>Sumatran</b> <b>Tiger</b> cubs, Indah and Rahni, {{were born}} at Tiger Island. At {{around the same}} time, the Avis Vintage Cars were {{relocated}} from Rivertown to a new location in the Australian Wildlife Experience. In July 2007, {{it was announced that}} Dreamworld would be adding Mick Doohan's Motocoaster in time for the September school holidays. The ride would be a motorbike roller coaster manufactured by Intamin. On 30 September 2007, Mick Doohan's Motocoaster officially opened to the public.|$|E

25|$|Aceh has {{the largest}} range of {{biodiversity}} in the Asian Pacific region. Among the rarer large mammals are the Sumatran rhinoceros, <b>Sumatran</b> <b>tiger,</b> Orangutan and Sumatran elephant. In 2014, there were 460 Sumatran elephants in Aceh including at least eight baby elephants. The area has been suffering from deforestation since the 1970s. The first wood pulp mill in Aceh was built in 1982. The government of Aceh intends a law by which 1.2 million hectares would be opened for commercial use. This proposal has caused many protests.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, Ardent Leisure shifted {{its focus}} to {{improving}} its offerings of water attractions. In April, Blue Lagoon was closed {{due to its}} planned replacement by WhiteWater World as a separate gated complex. On 24 June, the FlowRider opened in Ocean Parade. On 7 November, the Eureka Mountain Mine Ride closed and has remained standing but not operating to this day. In 2007, two <b>Sumatran</b> <b>Tiger</b> cubs, Indah and Rahni, were born at Tiger Island. Later that year in September, Mick Doohan's Motocoaster opened after the relocation of the Avis Vintage Cars.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, a male <b>Sumatran</b> <b>tiger</b> called Kepala {{arrived from}} Dudley Zoo {{to join the}} two {{resident}} female Bengal tigers, who left in 2008. The same year, the zoo acquired a female tiger named Kirana, but unfortunately {{it was discovered that}} the pair were related. Kepala departed to Dublin Zoo and a new male named Fabi was brought in from Prague Zoo to form a breeding pair of Sumatrans, a critically endangered subspecies in the wild. Kirana and Fabi bred and have so far bred successfully on three occasions since 2011.|$|E

25|$|While Orang Pendek {{or similar}} animals have {{historically}} been reported throughout Sumatra in Indonesia, and Southeast Asia, recent sightings have occurred largely within the Kerinci Regency of central Sumatra and especially within the borders of Taman Nasional Kerinci Seblat (Kerinci Seblat National Park) (TNKS). The park, 2° south of the equator, is located within the Bukit Barisan mountain range and features {{some of the most}} remote primary rainforest in the world. Habitat types within the park include lowland dipterocarp rainforest, montane forests, and volcanic alpine formations on Mt. Kerinci, the second highest peak in Indonesia. Because of its inaccessibility, the park has been largely spared from the rampant logging occurring throughout Sumatra and provides one of the last homes for the endangered <b>Sumatran</b> <b>tiger.</b>|$|E
25|$|The zoo {{is highly}} {{proactive}} in species preservation and conservation efforts and participates in over 40 Species Survival Plans (SSP) with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. The {{following is a}} list of the Species Survival Plans (SSP) that the zoo is involved with: addax, Chinese alligator, mandrill, bongo, kori bustard, fishing cat, cheetah, chimpanzee, Lake Victoria cichlids, Andean condor, wattled crane, African elephant, addra gazelle, white-cheeked gibbon, gorilla, great hornbill, rhinoceros hornbill, spectacled langur, ring-tailed lemur, ruffed lemur, mona monkey, Allen's swamp monkey, Bali mynah, ocelot, okapi, Arabian oryx, scimitar-horned oryx, Oriental small-clawed otter, thick-billed parrot, African penguin, Mauritius pink pigeon, Aruba Island rattlesnake, black rhinoceros, Louisiana pine snake, black-handed spider monkey, cottontop tamarin, golden lion tamarin, Indochinese tiger, <b>Sumatran</b> <b>tiger,</b> Puerto Rican crested toad, radiated tortoise, Swainson's toucan, and Grevy's zebra.|$|E

50|$|In 2008 the {{population}} of <b>Sumatran</b> <b>tigers</b> has been estimated to be between ca.30 to 100. In 2013 their number has been estimated to be between 23-76, or 20% of the total population.|$|R
50|$|In 1993, the {{red panda}} exhibit re-opened and the Malayan Woods Pavilion opened. The <b>sumatran</b> <b>tigers</b> arrived in 1994. Naked mole-rats went on exhibit in 1996. Komodo dragons become a feature exhibit in 1997.|$|R
25|$|Since TCM recognizes bear bile as a medicinal, {{more than}} 12,000 asiatic black bears {{are held in}} bear farms. The bile is {{extracted}} through a permanent hole in the abdomen leading to the gall bladder, which can cause severe pain. This can lead to bears trying to kill themselves. As of 2012, approximately 10,000 bears are farmed in China for their bile. This practice has spurred public outcry across the country. The bile is collected from live bears via a surgical procedure. The deer penis {{is believed to have}} therapeutic benefits according to traditional Chinese medicine. It is typically very big and, proponents believe, in order to preserve its properties, it should be extracted from a living deer. Medicinal tiger parts from poached animals include tiger penis, believed to improve virility, and tiger eyes. The illegal trade for tiger parts in China has driven the species to near-extinction because of its popularity in traditional medicine. Laws protecting even critically endangered species such as the <b>Sumatran</b> <b>tiger</b> fail to stop the display and sale of these items in open markets. Shark fin soup is traditionally regarded in Chinese medicine as beneficial for health in East Asia, and its status as an elite dish has led to huge demand with the increase of affluence in China, devastating shark populations. The shark fins {{have been a part of}} traditional Chinese medicine for centuries. Shark finning is banned in many countries, but the trade is thriving in Hong Kong and China, where the fins are part of shark fin soup, a dish considered a delicacy, and used in some types of traditional Chinese medicine.|$|E
500|$|Body size of {{different}} populations {{seems to be}} correlated with climate—Bergmann's rule—and {{can be explained by}} thermoregulation.

500|$|Five {{days after}} the Grasshopper was bombed, a tongkang arrived which took the {{survivors}} to Singkep Island, {{the largest of the}} Lingga Islands. There they left their wounded, and Judy along with the other survivors travelled two days later on a Chinese junk to Sumatra where it was hoped that a British force remained which could take them to Sri Lanka. Upon arrival, they took the vessel up a series of rivers until they narrowed so much that the junk could not pass. They then embarked on a [...] cross-country trek across the island in an attempt to reach Padang. During the journey through the jungle, Judy was attacked by a crocodile and suffered a cut to her shoulder. The survivors patched up the [...] cut with their limited first aid supplies. She continued to warn them of approaching predators, and one crewman claimed she saved him from a <b>Sumatran</b> <b>tiger.</b> They emerged from the jungle at Sawahlunto, where they caught the train towards Padang. The group missed the last evacuation ship by nine days, with the Japanese due to arrive to take over the city at any moment. After the arrival of the Japanese, the survivors from the Grasshopper along with Judy, were taken into custody as prisoners of war on 18 March.|$|E
50|$|It {{consists}} of swamp forest and lowland rain forest, mostly of secondary growth as result of extensive logging in the 1960s and 1970s.
