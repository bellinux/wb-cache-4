50|$|Although {{the actual}} shoe {{manufacturing}} {{has changed since}} the company was first founded they still produce their footwear with the highest quality. They do this with highly skilled employees who perform various operations in the manufacture process. It is a labour-intensive method but ensures all shoes are of the highest quality. A Goodyear Welt is used by Wildsmith in their <b>shoe</b> <b>assembly,</b> which warrants an exceptional degree of strength and reliability integrated into the shoe.|$|E

A jiiction interface contact pressure-dependent {{model for the}} coupling between the lined brake <b>shoe</b> <b>assembly</b> and the brake drum is described. Using this model, natural modes and f i e uencies are predicted which compare well with measured data for the brake assembly. A parametric study of brake design and peJormance variables is presented which predicts the noise propensity of the brake design based on the binaryjutter model. Good agreement with measured brake noise and trends, experience and other published work on S-cam brake noise is shown...|$|E

40|$|A need {{to reduce}} the number of design iterations, coupled with a {{requirement}} to reduce the weight of the new generation of TPU running shoes has lead to the use of finite element analysis (FE) within the athletic shoe industry. The collaborators in this research, adidas, were already using the technology, but only on individual parts, and on a reverse engineered basis. This thesis presents a thorough review into the materials used in athletic footwear, their application within running shoes and the methods of testing non-linear, highly deformable polymers and polymer foams. The fundamentals of the FE process are examined, along with a discussion of the current testing methods for shoes. The novelty in this work comes mainly from the comprehensive, logical progression through the modelling process as applied to this new area. Sample materials were tested, revealing new test methods. These were then analysed and converted for use in ABAQUS v 6. 5 which was the FE software used. The modelling of the sample materials, their tests, then shoe parts and midsole assemblies are discussed at length. At each stage the required complexities were added to the model, and these are detailed. This includes the import, conversion and repair of highly complex geometry, meshing techniques for this geometry, methods of building models of <b>shoe</b> <b>assemblies</b> and all relevant issues that arose from these processes. In addition, a shoe with an internal mechanism was modelled to assist in the design process. The effect of damage to shoe materials was also studied. Physical tests were carried out to verify all the FE models, and the results are presented. In addition, shoes taken from the end of the production line with the uppers attached were tested in order to compare the change in performance between the component parts and a finished product. The results of the modelling showed that was possible to construct and run full shoe assembliesw ithin a reasonablet ime. Fair prediction of the physical responseo f the assemblies was seen using material data taken directly from the sample data, but a method of correcting the initial error in the material test is presented which gives very good force/deflection results in TPU parts. A method of adjusting the entire assembly's material models is then presented, which improves the initial verification. In addition to force/deflection readings, digital image processing was used to monitor the structural response of the shoe during loading, and a set of structural metrics is put forward. The results of these indicated that while the shoe models were representing the cushioning response well, the shape of the shoe was not replicated, suggesting that the model in its present state would be unsuitable for use in some forms of test. Suggestions for improvement are made.

40|$|The goal on this {{investigation}} {{was to develop a}} detachable high heel shoe construction that could enter the current high heel market. The impact of high heel shoes on women's fashion is enormous but there are associated issues of comfort and health with these shoes. This work aims to maintain the appealing aspects of a high heel shoe while adding a concealed mechanism to enable the heel to be easily removed to convert the shoe into a flat at the discretion of the user. The current solutions and products in the nearly 7 billion dollar a year women's shoe market are minimal. The prior arts of detachable heels fail to develop a simple comprehensive detachable high heel that can enter the market. A feasible and complete design that takes into account arch stiffness, heel removal, styling, and manufacturability is the goal of this work. This investigation deconstructed high heel shoes to learn and leverage the current high heel shoe infrastructure as a basis for adapting the shoe into a detachable high heel shoe construction. Three prototypes of the detachable high heel shoe were developed with a <b>shoe</b> <b>assembly</b> that consisted of a modified insole and a detachable heel that consisted of a dovetailed aluminum shank fastened to a high heel. (cont.) The prototypes were able to display the ability for the detachable high heel to maintain high heel stability, styling that is consistent with the industry, ease of use, a flat shoe and other critical functional requirements identified in the work. The construction was consistent with the current industry high heel infrastructure. The development of the detachable high heel construction displays the feasibility of such a product in a market where none exist. The detachable high heel construction needs further refinement and optimization to complete a design that is ready to enter this exciting market. by Alfredo Louis Morales. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|System Design. A chem-milled outer skin, an {{improved}} thermoelectric element adjustment and access plug, a flexible stainless steel-aluminum joint welded via ultrasoric techniques, a flexible hot <b>shoe</b> <b>assembly,</b> and thermal hydrauilc heat dump system {{were incorporated into}} {{the design of the}} environmental and ground test generators. Materials Analysis. Burnup studies on fuel forms were continued with CeF/sub 3 / and CeO/sub 2 /. SiC/sub 2 / appeared to be the most promising addition to CeO/sub 2 /. Tests showed that the Allegheny Ludlum alloy S- 818 alloy is resistant to attack by CeO/sub 2 / and CeF/sub 3 /, but is attacked by Ce metal. Hazards Analysis Analyses of launch abort impact zones for the open core and of aerodynamic burnup for near orbital injection on two types of Mo fuel cores continued. Manufacturing. Fabrication and assembly of the first electrically heated generator was completed. System and Component Test. It was found that lead telluride couples increased in resistivitg after heating to l 000 deg F and masked resistivity changes because of radiation. Inconel X cores were heated to approximately 15 O 0 deg and impacted on either granite or water tatgets. All of thr cerium-metal loaded cores ruptured. Cores loaded with lavite pellets were recovered intact. Heat transfer mockup teats were completed with a revised twolayer stainless steel heat shield. SNAP-III. The 3 MlG 3 thermoelectric generator was repaired and parametric testing resumed. The power output of ths second SNAP-III unit was measured and proof of thermoelectric generator operation for at least a period of a year wae demonstrated. SNAP-III. The performance characteristics of a second SHAP-IIIA generator of completely new design were only marginally better than the original. Tests were performed on metal-encased and ribbon-emitter types of tubes. A wire-wound ceramic heater and a tungsten-wire radiation heater were fabricated and tested. Work wse continued on the molybdenum collector used in conjunction with a Type B impregnated tungsten emitter. Low Power Thermionic Generator. Work on improved heat transfer between the emitter holder and the heat source revealed that a layer of Mo powder between the two surfaces gives a lower film drop and more consistent results. Creep tests on sapphire spacers (Al/sub 2 /O/sub 3 /) showed that some creep takes place above 1200 deg C, and above 1300 deg C, the strength of the sapphire falls off rapidly. A device for measuring the thermal expansion of CeO/ sub 2 / fuel pellets while in a hot cell was fabricated. Thermoelectric 2 - to 5 - Watt Generator. Altitude chamber tests of the generators were successfully completed. A shock-wave test proved the capsule can survive missile propellant detonation. Power output versus time plots were developed for both the cerium- and polonium-fueled systems. (M. C. G. ...|$|E
