Paul Virilio believes that the [...] "real" [...] is being mistaken by virtual and the virtual world destroys physical presence.

The image of one’s <b>self</b> becomes <b>aware</b> of itself in a world of technology. Consciousness and desire become less individualistic and turns into more already constituted social forms. The response to how someone feels something, what it means, and how it feels (for example feeling [...] "attached" [...] to someone after losing your virginity to them) is already set up through media communication (show, music, movies, articles). People will anticipate that they will be attached because of what they already know about it, so when it happens they do feel attached because that is how they were programmed to feel. People have turned to technology to create their [...] "self" [...] and determine how they feel and act. The conscious mind does not move into a world-as-other mindset but into an already constituted world.|$|R
50|$|Existential {{therapy is}} {{based on the premise that}} there are several factors that {{influence}} one's life, like culture and biology, and that the central problems people experience are due to isolation, anxiety, despair, and loneliness. The goal of therapy is to develop skills to make good life choices and use positive forces—like love, authenticity, and creativity— to create a meaningful life. Viktor Frankl, psychiatrist and author of Man's Search for Meaning, said that according to research there was a correlation between lack of meaning in one's life and depression, addictions, and criminal behavior. People who do not have a sense of meaning in their life are prone to neurotic compulsions and obsessions, boredom, materialism, hatred, power, and hedonistic pleasures. Rather than focusing on the past or future, existential therapy focuses on the present and the relationship with one's <b>self,</b> by being <b>aware</b> of one's feelings, using relaxation and other forms of therapies, and learning how to deal directly with issues.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines relational {{models of}} selfhood cross-culturally {{through the work}} of G. W. F. Hegel, Simone de Beauvoir, and Nishida Kitarō. In the master-slave section of the Phenomenology of Spirit, Hegel states that the <b>self</b> becomes <b>aware</b> of itself only through {{the presence of the}} Other. In this encounter, consciousness discovers that the Other can be a source of recognition (Anerkennung). I turn to the work of Beauvoir and Nishida because they further develop Hegel's notion of recognition through their insistence that the face-to-face relationship that incites self-knowledge is mediated by social-historical events and discourses. Fundamentally, they make Hegel's notion of recognition more concrete, thus giving the reader of the master-slave dialectic an idea of the broader implications of Hegel's view. While Nishida uses few examples to illustrate the determinacy of the historical field of relations, Beauvoir's The Second Sex is full of such descriptions, thus offering the reader of Nishida an illustration of the "historical world" that includes dimensions of constituted and constituting forces. Nishida's metaphor of the self as a place of interaction, or basho, in turn, is useful to the reader of Beauvoir who attempts to picture a self that is a project "toward the other. " Moreover, their discussions of agency are weighted toward the perspective of the self in the case of Beauvoir and toward the side of the world for Nishida. Ultimately, this difference can be viewed as grounding the distinct ways in which the authors conceive of ethics. Lastly, both authors attribute ethical action to self-surpassing. However, for Beauvoir, the surpassing of one's individuality leads to the transformation of self-other relations through the mutual recognition of freedom, while Nishida's self-surpassing entails seeking a new locus of ethical action, i. e. absolute nothingness...|$|R

5000|$|The {{setting of}} this movie is Shanghai, China. A young Shu Nian is a lonely 10 year old kid who is living in an Shanghai Roman Catholic Church Orphanage, where he hopes {{to find a good}} family that loves him. This is where 8 year old but taller and stronger, Xie Yan, the son of a real estate magnate, goes with his mother to pick out a brother for himself. He chooses Shu Nian, and the Xie family adopts him. The two boys adore each other and do {{everything}} together. At night they sleep in the same bed and Xie Yan develops the habit of falling asleep wrapped around the older but smaller boy. Twenty years later, Xie Yan returns home from London after spending six years abroad and is reunited with Shu Nian and expects to pick up where they were before he left, including sleeping in the same bed with Xie Yan holding onto his brother. Shu Nian , however, has meanwhile become the manager of marketing in the Xie Holding Company, and is now standing on his own, living in his own home alone, having been six years without Xie Yan. Xie Yan does cannot accept the changes in the now more adult and independent Shu Nian, and every time he tries to get close to his bother, and his brother flinches, he flies into a rage of temper. Without realizing it Xie Yan's temper is to deflect his homoerotic feelings for Shu Nian. Shu Nian flinches every time his adult brother touches him because Shu Nian realizes that he is in love with Xie Yan and always has been. Things get worse when Xie Yan demands that Shu Nian give up the private home their father gave him and move back into the Xie family mansion. He has the butler prepare the room directly across the hall from his own bedroom for Shu Nian. Then he forces Shu Nian to sleep with him so he can hold him just as he did many years before. Xie Yan is unaware of his motives having a suppressed sexual component now that he is an adult. On the other hand, Shu Nian more than realizes it, and can see nothing but disaster ahead when their family figure it out, and he is sure they will soon catch on. Tension between the two brothers builds and the troubles begin, and they are many. A lot of drama goes down as the view might guess given the fact the two brothers will not sit down together for an honest talk but only blunder deeper and deeper into a downward spiral. However, his latest girlfriend crosses the line in front of Shu Nian while in a restaurant with both of the men by accusing Shu Nian of being gay and in love with Xie Yan. This starts a downward spiral in their relationship and Xie Yan ultimately dumps her. Jiang Yao, is a ruthless and crafty girlfriend and plots her revenge against Shu Nian after Xie Yan dumps her, as Jiang Yao found out a secret that involves a box full of photos of Xie Yan. Xie Yan is homophobic and doesn't know that Shu Nian is gay, and to make matters worse, Shu Nian falls for Xie Yan, and Xie Yan confronts Shu Nian and Shu Nian admits to Xie Yan that he is gay. Shocked by the candor of his adopted brother Xie Yan asks Shu Nian to leave the room. Then Xie Yan has their father send Shu Nian to New York for six months. As soon as Shu Nian is on the plane, Xie Yan rushes to the airport in his car arriving only in time to watch the plane climb into the clouds and out of site. Xie Yan then collapses onto the steering wheel of his custom sports car realizing that Shu Nian is the only one for him, and has always been the only one, {{and for the first time}} confronts his own sexuality. However, despite this first time revelation, Xie Yan still has trouble coming out of the closet and admitting to himself that he is also gay. On top of that he is dealing with his first time recognition of being a hypocrite for sending his more <b>self</b> <b>aware</b> admittedly gay adopted brother away for having feeling of unconditional real love for him. Both of these new recognition's are complicated by the fact that he is, and always has been, in love with his adopted brother... Just as his younger brother has always been in love with him. Both siblings have had to struggle with this. Since Xie Yan chose Shu Nian at the orphanage to be his adopted brother, telling his mother, [...] "he is the one", the two brothers suffered through a twenty year struggle with the tug-of-war caused by being brothers, and being in love with each other at the same time. Xie Yan was constantly switching between trying to pull Shu Nian closer, only to the react in fear, and then push him away again. Shu Nian is more <b>self</b> <b>aware</b> and more mature, so this back and forth forced on him by Xie Yan tortured him deeply. However, just being close to Xie Yan was enough to make him endure the pain and suffering: That is unconditional love at its pinnacle height. However, both brothers demonstrated many times that they were willing to die for each other, and to sacrifice anything for each other, even during the times they caused each other to suffer the most. The first movie is the most painful to watch by far, but in the pain, the viewer can sense tremendous love of the two young men, and the possibility of triumph over tragedy. Shu Nian returns from being sent to New York by Xie Yan manipulating their father, and instead of returning to the Xie company takes a job as a waiter in a trendy upscale nightclub and rents an apartment. Leaving the club one night he finds 17 year old high school student, Ke Luo, drunk in back of the building near the employees door. Ke Luo is also adopted from an orphanage and is a 20% (majority) shareholder of The Ke Holding Company. Both Shu Nian and Ke Luo become close because the night they met the drunk boy told Shu Nian he lived in an orphanage. Shu Nian treats Ke Luo as his little brother, but he teenager misunderstands and falls for Shu Nian. Xie Yan sees this and becomes highly jealous and begins see that his feelings for Shu Nian are even deeper than the had already thought. This sets up the next movie to begin with high drama and conflict. The first movie ends.|$|E

5000|$|Al Farabi {{is known}} for his famous Doctrine, namely {{harmonization}} of opinions of Aristotle and Plato. On the one hand Al-Farabi believes that Aristotle rejected Plato's Forms, but Aristotle himself, on the other hand, had difficulty with divine forms. Avicenna developed the notion of knowledge by presence in the argument of the floating man. According to this argument, if we consider the I-ness of a human in absolutely empty air, then the only thing to conceive is the selfness of a human without any material faculties. On one hand Surevardi criticized Avicenna's theory of knowledge which is based on the important roles of definitions. On the other hand Suhrevardi introduced innate knowledge in which awareness and consciousness are basic. According to Suhrevardi,k nowledge by presence encompasses the conception of a thing, which is along with assent to it. According to Suhrevardi's theory of knowledge, the true knowledge is achieved not by concepts but through a direct knowledge of things divine. Illuminationist philosophers know the knowledge of two kinds, of which knowledge by presence is one of them. Knowledge by presence is of a nonrepresentational, immediate character along with no reference to external objects. According to Suhrevardi, the [...] "self" [...] could know itself just by virtue of its presence. It also knows consciousness beyond the distinction of the subject and object division in epistemology. According to Suhrevardi, it is also described by self-objectivity, namely the nature of this knowledge is to the reality of awareness and in this knowledge the <b>self</b> is <b>aware</b> it is existentially one and the same thing. Therefore, the self and consciousness of the self are individually and numerically one thing. Surevardi also pointed out that all knowledge is returned to knowledge by presence. In other words in representational knowledge the presence of an image in the mind in turn is a kind of knowledge by presence.|$|R

This can be said of all non-white women in the United States. Her oppression by the forces of racism and imperialism is similar to that endured by our men. Oppression by sexism, however, is hers alone.” Women also sought out to battle the internalized struggles of self-hatred rooted in the colonization of their people. This included breaking the mujer buena/mujer mala myth, in which the domestic Spanish Woman is viewed as good and the Indigenous Woman that {{is a part of the}} community is viewed as bad. Chicana feminist thought emerged as a response to patriarchy, racism, classism, and colonialism as well as a response to all the ways that these legacies of oppression have become internalized.|$|R
40|$|SmallCells are {{deployed}} {{in order to}} enhance the network performance by bringing the network closer to the user. However, as the number of low power nodes grows increasingly, the overall energy consumption of the SmallCells base stations cannot be ignored. A relevant amount of energy could be saved through several techniques, especially power control mechanisms. In this paper, we are concerned with energy <b>aware</b> <b>self</b> organizing networks that guarantee a satisfactory performance. We consider satisfaction equilibria, mainly the efficient satisfaction equilibrium (ESE), to ensure a target quality of service (QoS) and save energy. First, we identify conditions of existence and uniqueness of ESE under a stationary channel assumption. We fully characterize the ESE and prove that, whenever it exists, it is a solution of a linear system. Moreover, we define satisfactory Pareto optimality and show that, at the ESE, no player can increase its QoS without degrading the overall performance. Under a fast fading channel assumption, as the robust satisfaction equilibrium solution is very restrictive, we propose an alternative solution namely the long term satisfaction equilibrium, and describe how to reach this solution efficiently. Finally, in order to find satisfactory solution per all users, we propose fully distributed strategic learning schemes based on Banach-Picard, Mann and Bush Mosteller algorithms, and show through simulations their qualitative properties. fully distributed strategic learning schemes based on Banach Picard, Mann and Bush Mosteller algorithms, and show through simulations their qualitative properties...|$|R

The sample {{for the study}} comprised {{of a group of}} 100 children (50 militancy affected and 50 non-militancy affected) selected for detailed study from a residential institution of Jammu in J&K state of India. The children were between 6 - 12 years of age at the time of study. The non militancy affected children were taken as reference group and were matched with the core group (militancy affected) on the basis of age, intelligence quotient, duration of stay in the institution and gender. It was a correlation field study in which data was collected using multi-method approach. Standardized tool used for the study included Self Concept Check list (SLC). In addition to it, self devised tools i. e. interview guides, observations and secondary data from institutional and school records were also used. The results revealed that contrary to the expectation militancy affected group of children were found to have awareness about their present self as compared to non militancy affected children. They revealed realistic knowledge of their <b>self.</b> They were <b>aware</b> of their positive and negative personality traits. They were, however, unable to express their deeper emotional state and were found to be unconsciously harboring feelings of insecurity and powerlessness. The present study is expected to provide practical need based suggestions for bringing about positive changes in self concept of children in similar situations...|$|R
