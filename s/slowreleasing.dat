Some gelatin microspheres have {{an affinity for}} fibronectin-bearing surfaces; these miscrospheres exploit the interaction between gelatin and fibronectin. PLGA copolymer microspheres were selected because they have reproducible and <b>slowrelease</b> characteristics in vivo. The PLGA microspheres were surface modified with gelatin to impart fibronectin recognition. Dexamethasone was incorporated into these microspheres because dexamethasone is beneficial in chronic human diseases associated with extra fibronectin expression (eg, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory disorders, rheumatoid arthritis). The gelatin surface modified PLGA microspheres (prepared by adsorption, conjugation, and spray coating) were investigated and characterized by encapsulation efficiency, particle size, in vitro release, and affinity for fibronectin. The gelatincoated PLGA microspheres had higher interaction with fibronectin compared with the other gelatin surface modified PLGA microspheres (adsorption and conjugation).

40|$|Transgenic mice expressing mutant {{forms of}} both amyloid-beta (A�) {{precursor}} protein (APP) and presenilin (PS) 2 develop severe brain amyloidosis and cognitive deficits, two pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). One-year-old APP/PS 2 mice with high brain levels of A � and abundant A � plaques show disturbances in spatial learning and memory. Treatment of these deteriorated mice with a systemic <b>slowrelease</b> formulation of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) significantly ameliorated AD-like disturbances. Thus, IGF-I enhanced cognitive performance, decreased brain A � load, increased {{the levels of}} synaptic proteins, and reduced astrogliosis associated to A � plaques. The beneficial effects of IGF-I were associated to {{a significant increase in}} brain A � complexed to protein carriers such as albumin, apolipoprotein J or transthyretin. Since levels of APP were not modified after IGF-I therapy, and in vitro data showed that IGF-I increases the transport of A�/carrier protein complexes through the choroid plexus barrier, it seems that IGF-I favors elimination of A � from the brain, supporting a therapeutic use of this growth factor in AD. © 2005 Published by Elsevier Inc...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT It was {{investigated}} whether up-regulation of the NPY gene by the schistosome Trichobilharzia ocellata in its snail host Lymnaea stagnalis redirects the host’s energy flows. We cloned the cDNA encoding Lymnaea NPY (LyNPY), purified and sequenced the peptide, and used synthesized peptide for physiological and morphological studies. Increasing the LyNPY titer in nonparasitized snails (mimicking parasitosis) by 1) implantation of <b>slowrelease</b> pellets and 2) injections suppressed reproductive activity and reduced growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner without affecting food intake. When the LyNPY titer {{was back to}} normal, reproduction and growth were resumed, coinciding with a transient increase of food intake serving to replenish glycogen stores. Observations on doubleimmunostained whole mount preparations of brains support these data. A close association was found between LyNPY-positive axons and axons both from ovulation hormone-producing neurons and molluscan insulin-like peptide-producing neurons involved in regulation of growth. As no synaptic(-like) contacts were observed, it is supposed that LyNPY acts nonsynaptically. No morphological interaction was found between LyNPY-positive axons and motoneurons innervating the feeding apparatus. Our data explain why it is an advantageous strategy for endoparasites to up-regulate the highly conserved NPY gene in their host. —de Jong-Brink, M., Reid, C. N. ...|$|R

Single, preplant applications of three slow - release products (methylene urea, coated ammonium sulfate and coated urea) were compared {{with the use of}} urea -ammonium nitrate added in either one or three split applications. The total amount of N applied to all treated plots was 100 lbs. per acre. Whole plant samples were taken four times during the season to determine N uptake patterns. Petioles from the youngest fully expanded leaves were sampled on four dates throughout the season to monitor the N status of all plots. At harvest, total and marketable melon yields were determined. In general, the methylene urea treatment was superior to the use of coated (NH₄) ₂SO₄ which in turn was far superior to the coated urea product. The split UAN and preplant UAN treatments had the highest numerical values for total N uptake for all three melon types. However, these values were usually not statistically different from the N uptake in response to the three slow- release N treatments.

40|$|Objective. The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} 1) to develop standard testing practices to be used when evaluating crush resistance properties of abuse deterrent formulations, and 2) to determine which methods of particle size reduction (manual or electrical) are the most discriminatory for measuring crush resistance of tablet dosage forms. Background. Crushing, or particle size reduction, is often the first step to make a medication easier to snort, to dissolve for injection, or to destroy <b>slowrelease</b> mechanisms in order to achieve greater euphoric effects. However, no standard methods exist on testing crush resistant properties of prescription medications susceptible to abuse. Such testing is crucial for comparative purposes and to obtain abuse-deterrent labelling for the newly-marketed abuse-deterrent products. Methods. Tablets containing poly(ethylene oxide) as a deterrent agent and acetaminophen as model drug were formulated on tablet press (2000 pounds) before undergoing a post compaction thermal process reported for a crush-resistant marketed formulation. Crush resistance was then assessed using manual (i. e., pill crusher, pestle-mortar) and mechanical (i. e., hardness tester, ball mill, high shear grinder, domestic blender) methods at different time durations and sample mass. The resultant product was then analyzed by sieve analysis. Results. Significant differences were observed between the particle size distributions using different methods. The domestic blender and high shear grinder had better ability to differentiate products compared to other tooling. Conclusion. There is no universal method to measure crush resistance, and methods used to perform particle size reduction can display different level of resistance to manipulation Grants.

40|$|Slow-release {{fertilizers}} {{are gaining}} acceptance to increase fertilizer use efficiency and reduce environmental impact. The release of nitrogen from methylene urea, a common slow release N fertilizer, {{is controlled by}} microbial decomposition. An enzyme hydrolyzing <b>slowrelease</b> nitrogen fertilizer, methylene urea, was purified from Rhizobium radiobacter (Agrobacterium tumefaciens) to homogeneity using a four-step purification procedure with an overall yield of 3 %. The active enzyme has a molecular mass of approximately 180 kDa determined by size exclusion chromatography, and the SDS page of the purified protein indicated three subunits of different sizes (62, 34 and 32 kDa). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 62 kDa fragment indicates identity with urease subunits from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (73 %) and Helicobacter pylori (71 %). However, for the internal amino acid sequences of the 62 kDa fragment no matches with known proteins were found. Some internal peptides in the smaller subunits (32 and 34 kDa) are homologous to urease subunits and unknown proteins in Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Based on the kinetic properties, substrate selectivity, and inhibition characteristics, the novel enzyme (MUase) is an intracellular enzyme complex with urease activity. The enzymatic mechanism of methylene urea breakdown was studied using a novel LC–MS method for MU analysis, which indicates that all cold-water soluble nitrogen forms of methylene urea are subjected to hydrolysis, and the hydrolysis proceeds via methylurea, urea and other yet unidentified hydrolysis-products, suggesting that the isolated enzyme complex performs a multistep hydrolysis.

They were fertilized with three different amounts of a <b>slowrelease</b> fertilizer with the doses of 8, 24 and 48 g of nitrogen per plant. Root respiration was measured using an infrared gas analyser by perfusing air through the pot on 9 plants per treatment on three dates 14 days apart. Measure of root respiration of the three treatments over time was made in order to obtain a large range of growth and nutrient uptake. Root respiration normalized at 22 °C ranged from 0. 09 to 0. 23 gC d? 1 for the three treatments during all the experiment. It was well predicted with a model that includes root growth rate and root nitrogen content. The nitrogen related maintenance coefficient was negatively correlated to the root nitrogen concentration suggesting a decrease in protein turnover with increasing fertility. Growth rate of fine root in a virtual stand was simulated using age-related allometric equations and further used to estimate root respiration in the field. Simulated root respiration increased over time from 0. 39 to 3. 14 gC m? 2 d? 1 between 6 and 126 months assuming a turnover of 2 yr? 1 for fine roots.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine nifedipine <b>slowrelease</b> half-life and distribution volume in pregnant women and to compare these with pharmacokinetic parameters of nifedipine in non-pregnant subjects described in the literature. Materials: This is a study parallel to a trial studying women with threatened preterm labor between 26 + 0 and 32 + 2 weeks after initial tocolysis and a completed course of corticosteroids, who were randomly allocated to maintenance nifedipine (slow-release tablets 20 mg 4 times daily) or placebo. Exclusion criteria for the pharmacokinetic study were contra-indications for nifedipine, impaired liver function, and concomitant intake of inhibitors or inducers of the cytochrome P 450 3 A 4 isoenzyme. Blood samples for measuring nifedipine plasma concentrations were drawn at t = 0, t = 12 hours, t = 24 hours, t = 48 hours, t = 72 hours, t = 7 days, and t = 9 days. Methods: Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using iterative two-stage Bayesian population pharmacokinetic analysis by MWPharm ??? software. The study was designed to establish a correlation between body weight and nifedipine plasma level. Results: The pharmacokinetic parameters of nifedipine slow-release tablets were determined from the data of 8 pregnant women. Nifedipine slow-release had a half-life of 2 - 5 hours, a mean distribution volume of 6. 2 ± 1. 9 L/kg (calculated while using a fixed biological availability of 0. 45 taken from the literature due to lack of intravenous data in this population) compared to a half-life of 6 - 11 hours, and a distribution volume of 1. 2 - 1. 3 L/kg described in non-pregnant subjects in the literature. None of the women delivered during study medication. Study medication was continued for the duration of the pharmacokinetic study (9 days) in all women. A correlation between nifedipine plasma levels and maternal body weight was not demonstrated. This may have been caused by lack of power.

Subsurface soils from severalindustrial sites in southeastern U. S. were contaminated with arsenicthrough heavy application of herbicide containing arsenic trioxide. Themean concentrations of environmentally available arsenic in soilscollected from the two study sites, FW and BH, are 325 mg/kg and 900 mg/kg, respectively. The soils are sandy loams with varying mineralogicaland organic contents. The previous study [Yang L, Donahoe RJ. The form,distribution and mobility of arsenic in soils contaminated by arsenictrioxide, at sites in Southeast USA. Appl Geochem 2007; 22 : 320 341]indicated that {{a large portion of the}} arsenic in both soils is associatedwith amorphous aluminum and iron oxyhydroxides and shows very <b>slowrelease</b> against leaching by synthetic precipitation. The soil's amorphousaluminum and iron oxyhydroxides content was found to have the mostsignificant effect on its ability to retain arsenic. Based on thisobservation, contaminated soils were reacted with different treatmentsolutions in an effort to promote the formation of insolublearsenic-bearing phases and thereby decrease the leachability of arsenic. Ferrous sulfate, potassium permanganate and calcium carbonate were usedas the reagents for the chemical fixation solutions evaluated in threesets of batch experiments: (1) FeSO 4; (2) FeSO 4 and KMnO 4; (3) FeSO 4,KMnO 4 and CaCO 3. The optimum treatment solutions for each soil wereidentified based on the mobility of arsenic during sequential leaching oftreated and untreated soils using the fluids described in EPA Method 1311 [USEPA.

40|$|Access to decent {{sanitation}} {{remains a}} problem in developing countries. At the same time, sanitation technology is constantly evolving specifically regarding resource recovery solutions. Some chemical elements found in human excreta derived from non-renewable resources, and the recycling of phosphorous from sewage in particular is a possible solution to the growing issue of resource scarcity. A potential way to recover phosphorous from urine or water-borne sewage is through struvite precipitation. Struvite (MgNH₄PO₄. 6 H₂O) is a mineral {{that can be used}} as a <b>slowrelease</b> magnesium, ammonium and phosphate based fertilizer and can be produced from urine by adding magnesium to the ammonium and phosphate rich urine. Usually, magnesium is dosed chemically using salts such as MgCl₂, MgO, MgSO₄ or bittern, together with pH regulating agents but these reactants produce unfavourable chemical by-products and the process tends to be expensive. Previous studies have proven that electrochemical dosing of magnesium is a feasible and reliable method of struvite precipitation. It not only produces high grade struvite that is valuable and marketable, but it also eliminates the need for alkalinity dosing in order to create a suitable pH environment for struvite precipitation. Further to that, electrochemical precipitation does not produce any harmful chemical by-products. Previous work shows that one main challenge that is associated with this method is the formation of a mineral layer on the magnesium anode called nesquehonite (MgCO₃ · 3 H₂O). This leads to increased electrode potentials and hence high energy consumptions and may also lead to system failures of the reactor. Further to that, struvite generally precipitates as small crystals that are difficult to separate from the solution, leading to low mass recoveries of the product. These small crystals are formed as a result of the high supersaturation, which generally occurs for most processes that are employed to make struvite. In view of these problems, this dissertation presents an investigation of the potential improvements to the electrochemical precipitation of struvite from source-separated urine. The main aim is to minimise or eliminate the formation of mineral precipitates on the anode surface. It also looks into ways of increasing the crystal sizes of the struvite being precipitated in the electrochemical system. The methodology for this investigation involved modelling and experimental work. The specific objectives for this study were to: a) Investigate how thermodynamic modelling of struvite precipitation compares to the experimental results from an electrochemical precipitation reactor, b) Employ the aspect of seeding in an electrochemical reactor for struvite production and determine the technical feasibility of the proposed process, c) Establish how to minimise the formation of nesquehonite so that the quality of struvite produced in the electrochemical reactor is not compromised, d) Investigate how the crystal sizes of the struvite particles produced in the seeded electrochemical precipitation batch reactor setup compare to those produced in the continuously stirred reactor setup with a recycle that gives the particles a longer residence time, e) Investigate the economics and energy requirements of the SEP (Seeded electrochemical precipitation reactor) ...|$|R

This distillery wastewater, referred to as stillage, is a darkcolored, acidic, nutrient rich liquid that presents significant problems withits disposal. Unlike conventional distillery wastewater, this stillage maycontain recalcitrant products of biomass pretreatment. With US EPA tighteningthe industrial effluent discharge standards accompanied by decreasing landavailability for waste discharge, more intensive treatment approaches must beapplied to overcome stillage disposal issues. In this dissertation, an integrated system was developed totreat stillage produced from a sugarcane bagasse feedstock process.   The sugarcane bagasse is first pretreated ina dilute phosphoric acid process followed by enzymatic saccharification andthen fermentation.   The goals of theintegrated treatment system were to recover green {{energy in the form}} of biogas,recover nutrients, specifically phosphate via struvite precipitation, andfinally polish the effluent using advanced oxidation process to recover clean waterfor possible reuse in the ethanol plant. The aim of this integrated system wasto reduce the carbon and water foot print associated with the ethanolproduction process. Thermophilic anaerobic digestion (55 °C) of cellulosicethanol stillage was investigated using a 5. 5 L laboratory scale anaerobicfluidized bed reactor (AFBR). Batches of coarsely separated bagasse stillage(0. 425 mm sieve) obtained from the Biofuels pilot plant at the University ofFlorida with a high and variable soluble chemical oxygen demand (COD) rangingfrom 11. 5 to 63 g sCOD/L was used as feed.  The AFBR was operated for 100 days.  The methane potential achieved was 12. 9 L CH 4 (L Stillage) - 10. 288 L CH 4 (g sCOD loaded) - 1. Solubleorganic matter removal efficiency of 93 % was achieved at a hydraulic retentiontime (HRT) of 7. 3 days and an organic loading rate of 6. 54 g sCOD L- 1 d- 1. The effluent soluble COD was 3. 5 g sCOD/L. Organic acids and sugars weremonitored periodically during the entire run. No external nutrients (N and P) were added during the operation of the fluidized bed reactor.   Typical dilute acid pretreatment productslike furfurals and levulinic acids found in the stillage were degraded in theAFBR.   Upon operating the AFBR at aloading rate of 8. 8 g sCOD L- 1 d- 1, volatile organic acids(especially propionic acid) accumulated and methane production wassuppressed.   These organic acids wereconsumed within {{a couple of days after}} turning off the feed.   Thereafter, the AFBR was operated at normaloperating conditions (6. 54 g sCOD L- 1 d- 1).   A novel sequential batch reactor (SBR) technology (withfill, react, settle, decant and drain phases) was used to precipitate andrecover phosphate from anaerobically digested stillage, in the form of the <b>slowrelease</b> fertilizer struvite.   The use ofcoarsely separated stillage solids as seed in the SBR to promote settling ofstruvite was investigated.   Resultsshowed that unseeded trials produced a large amount of unsettled fine mineralprecipitates, while using 1 % (wet w/v) stillage solids as seed materialimproved settleability of processed sludge. More than 95 % of settling occurredwithin the first 15 minutes of undisturbed settling following the 30 minreaction time. About 99. 9 % and 56 % of orthophosphate-phosphorous andammonia-nitrogen, respectively, were recovered in the sludge.   Seeding also increased the yield of netamount of settled struvite precipitate-containing sludge by 63 %. The struvite-containingsettled sludge was also tested for its agronomic applicability and nutrientleachability. Results showed markedly improved nutrient uptake by plants andreduced N and P levels in leachate on application of settled sludge as soilamendment for cultivation of sweet sorghum. Anaerobically digested and struvite precipitated effluentwas then subjected to photocatalytic oxidation to decolorize and reduce organicmatter further.   Photocatalytic oxidationwas carried out using TiO 2 coated reusable sheets (TiO 2 loading: 3 mg/cm 2).    Batch experiments were performed to study theeffect of initial soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD), depth, pH, lightsource and silver doping of TiO 2 catalyst on decolorization andorganic matter removal. Organic concentration of 3500 mg sCOD/L in anaerobicallydigested effluent was an obstacle for efficient photocatalytic treatment.   It was shown that dilution of this effluentdid not enhance photocatalytic degradation.  However, after reducing the soluble COD by biological aerobic treatment organicmatter removal, decolorization was enhanced.  The extent of decolorization was 91. 3 %, 91. 5 % and 77 % after 22, 55 and 80. 5 hours for 1, 3 and 5 mm depths, respectively, at neutral pH. The final treatedsCOD was 80 mg/L.   Significantdecolorization was observed only after the sCOD dropped below 600 mg/L duringtreatment. There was very little decolorization (~ 25 %) at pH of 9 or above. First order rate constants were determined to compare the kinetics of thephotodegradation process. Undoped TiO 2 with UV-A lamp and silverdoped TiO 2 with UV-C lamp had the highest first order rateconstants; 0. 087 h- 1 and 0. 063 h- 1, respectively.   Correspondingly 94 %, 99 % decolorization, and 82 %, 91 % COD removal was attained after 41 and 59 hours of exposure. A mass and energy balance was developed for a 1 milliongallon ethanol plant using sugarcane bagasse as feedstock. The results showedbiogasification of stillage produces enough biogas to meet the energy demandsin the plant for steam generation and the excess may be used to produceelectricity. Phosphates recovered from the process as struvite are enough tosupply ~ 43 % of the fertilizer needs to cultivate sugarcane for bagasseproduction. And finally polishing the wastewater provides a means for recyclingwater in the plant. This might help reduce the dependence of bioethanol plantson ground water resources...|$|R

Systems based on crystalline and amorphous silicawere described. Control of the release rate could be achieved by adapting poresize or by pore wall functionalization. Recently, amorphous microporous silica(AMS) was identified as a suitable carrier for diffusive-controlled delivery ofthe drug ibuprofen. The release pattern could be regulated by changing pore orparticle size. Ibuprofen loading occurred via an impregnation of the poroussilica with molten ibuprofen. Those early results motivated the present studyin which the physical shape of the AMS was adapted in view of potentialapplications in oral drug delivery and release from medical implants. The genericnature of the AMS system was evaluated by loading a variety of drug moleculeswith different molecular size and electrical charges. AMS was synthesized following the standardacid-catalyzed sol-gel approach. Differentiation in synthesis parametersenabled a tuning of pore size of the material. Particle size could be adaptedby post-synthesis grinding and sieving. At first, AMS was evaluated forchlorhexidine diacetate controlled release. This antiseptic is widely used inmouthrinses due to its low resistance occurrence upon long-term use and itsbroad-spectrum activity. Chlorhexidine was introduced in the AMS pores using anincipient-wetness method. Differential scanning calorimetry and nitrogenphysisorption measurements confirmed chlorhexidine effectively entered thepores and was present in a molecularly dispersed state. Release from the AMSparticles under simulated biological circumstances was affected by particlesize and pore size, and a release pattern consistent with diffusion control wasobserved. AMS was shaped as a coating in order to open upapplication possibilities regarding implants. The coatings were introduced inan open macroporous Ti structure and loaded with chlorhexidine using theincipient-wetness method. In vitrotest conditions revealed a burst release of chlorhexidine followed by a <b>slowrelease</b> pattern lasting 10 days. Microbial tests on planktonic cultures of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Candida albicans, often found in implantinfections, demonstrated effective killing of the pathogens. These kind ofsystems could be applied as a strategy against bacterial colonization of theimplant site, which is important especially for dental implants. The irregular AMS particles with sharp edgesobtained in the standard sol-gel process present a potential hazard inpharmaceutical application. Spherical particles with rounded surfaces also areof practical interest regarding processing and ease of application of additionalcoatings. A new synthesis procedure was developed in order to obtain roundedparticles. The new oil drop type process yielded spherical particles withdiameters around 130 µm, having a broad particle size distribution. The spheresdisplayed physicochemical properties similar to the unmodified material andcould be successfully impregnated with drug. Slow release of ibuprofen wasobserved. Moreover, the release could be closely linked to the AMS materialporosity. Analysis of pore emptying during ibuprofen release showed the largerpores released ibuprofen faster while smaller pores contributed to a slowerrelease pattern resulting in a two step release. The release mechanism of molecules from AMS poreswas investigated more in depth. It was observed that ibuprofen andchlorhexidine are released from AMS materials in a diffusion-controlled mannerbut at different rates. In order to determine the release-controlling factors,three extra drug molecules were selected and released from AMS pores: flurbiprofen,ketoprofen and acetaminophen. Acetaminophen was selected in order to evaluatethe influence of molecular charge on release kinetics. The other two compoundswere selected for evaluating the influence of molecular size. Surprisingly,electric charge of the molecules had little influence on the diffusivity of themolecules in AMS pores. Molecular size and specifically molecular volume was adominant parameter. It was attempted to eliminate the influence of solubilitydifferences of the molecules in the release medium by maintaining sinkconditions during the release experiments. The particularly high solubility ofacetaminophen in comparison to other compounds strongly enhanced the release. Abstract		i Samenvatting		v List of abbreviations	ix CHAPTER 1.
