40|$|Fors-mann's {{first attempt}} ' and later {{developed}} by Cournand and Ranges 2 and {{a multitude of}} others, is now 35 years old. Its use has been extended to almost every conceivable blood vessel, while a host of improvements have contributed to both its safety and ease of performance. The cardiac catheter itself, however, has remained fundamentally unchanged during these past 35 years, although {{a large number of}} plastic materials have been used in its fabrication and the shape of its tip has been fashioned in a score of different ways. Es-sentially, however, it has remained a <b>semirigid</b> <b>plastic</b> tube that can be easily pushed or pulled but which will respond in a highly unpredictable and inconsistent way to rotatory movements applied at its hub from the out-side. Clearly, a catheter that would faithfully and precisely change the direction of its tip in situ, just as easily as it could be moved back and forth, was needed. The following is a report on the physical characteristics and clinical use of such an instrument-the positive torque-control cardiac catheter (Positrol). * Elastic Properties of Catheters Essentially, cardiac catheters may be either hollow plastic tubes of the extruded type or woven Nylon or Dacron tubes with plastic radiopaque coatings (fig. 1). If the laws of elasticity can be applied to catheters, their response to different load con-ditions may be determined. It should be realized that a complete description of con-straints, geometry, and loads encountered by catheters within the vascular system is very complex. Useful information, however, may be obtained through the analysis of simplified models. Similar to other structural systems, catheters may be subjected to any combination of deflection, compression, and torsion. Olin 3 found the following formulas adequate for the prediction of deflection (A) and critical loading (F crit. or Euler's buckling load) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} nonlinear dynamic analysis of frames with material and geometric nonlinearities {{which is based on}} the <b>semirigid</b> technique. The <b>plastic</b> hinge that accounts for the material nonlinearity is modeled as a pseudo-semirigid connection with nonlinear hysteretic moment-curvature characteristics at the element ends. The stiffness matrix of a frame element with material and geometric nonlinearities is expressed as the sum of products of the standard stiffness matrix and the geometric stiffness matrix of the element, with their corresponding correction matrices based on the plasticity factors developed from the section flexural stiffness at the plastic hinge locations. The combined stress yield condition is used for the force state determination of plastic hinges, and force equilibrium iterations and geometry updating for frames are carried out in every time step. When the key parameters of a structure are updated in a time step, the time step is split up into substeps to ensure accuracy while keeping the computations to a reasonable amount. The plastic rotation history can be calculated directly or in an approximate indirect way. The method is computationally efficient and it needs no additional connection elements, which makes it convenient for incorporation into existing linear dynamic analysis programs. Besides, the method can handle accurately and efficiently the dynamic analysis of nonlinear frames using relatively large time steps in conjunction with time step subdivision to cope with key parameter changes. A portal frame is used to verify the correctness of the proposed method. A more complicated five-story frame is used to illustrate the applicability and performance of the proposed method.
