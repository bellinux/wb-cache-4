5|$|Defining for {{his career}} was the {{invitation}} he got in 1944 from the people of Standaard Boekhandel, a chain of libraries who were also active as publishers. They were interested in his work and wanted to publish <b>some</b> <b>books.</b> Vandersteen presented them with the first designs for a daily comic strip, but they put that on hold and first ordered four juvenile books from Vandersteen. These were published in 1945 and 1946 in Dutch and French (by Casterman).|$|E
5|$|The {{publication}} {{sequence of}} the books differs from the fictional chronology, with the timeframe of <b>some</b> <b>books</b> overlapping. One of the novels, Flashman and the Redskins, is in two parts: part one takes place in 1849–50, while the second covers 1875–76. Although the main series of stories finishes in 1894, Flashman lives on until 1915 and appears in his late 80s in another Fraser novel, Mr American.|$|E

5|$|It is not {{a unique}} case among English medieval monasteries that almost nothing has survived of {{what must have been}} a number of books owned by the house as such or in the keeping of {{individual}} monks. These would include at least a small library with biblical texts, spiritual works and perhaps <b>some</b> <b>books</b> on practical subjects, bearing in mind that the management of the abbey plant would have been a considerable challenge. Furthermore, the celebration of the liturgy for a large part of the day and night would necessitate texts for the different participants, who as monks were for the most part not spectators but active participants, some of them with particular roles.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{considerable}} amount of scholarship on Jinnah which stems from Pakistan; according to Akbar S. Ahmed, it is not widely read outside the country and usually avoids even the slightest criticism of Jinnah. According to Ahmed, <b>some</b> <b>books</b> published about Jinnah outside Pakistan mention that he consumed alcohol, but this is omitted from books published inside Pakistan. Ahmed suggests that depicting the Quaid drinking would weaken Jinnah's Islamic identity, and by extension, Pakistan's. Some sources allege he gave up alcohol {{near the end of his}} life. Yahya Bakhtiar, who observed Jinnah from close quarters, concluded that Jinnah was a very sincere, deeply committed and dedicated Mussalman.|$|E
5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>books</b> {{such as the}} Yupian or the Meihōki {{were lost}} early in China, because of the {{persecution}} against Buddhism or for other reasons. The titles survived, however, {{because of the large}} volume of books previously imported to Japan, which were then subsequently re-exported to China. Today, some of the oldest extant manuscripts of Chinese books dating to the Tang Dynasty are located in Japan. Few of the early imported manuscripts have survived. Some of those that survived are listed as National Treasures below. Twenty Chinese book National Treasures exist that were created in China and subsequently imported to Japan. Of these, 19 date to the Tang Dynasty and one to the Southern Song. The designated items are of various type: six treasures are manuscripts of the Five Classics of Confucianism and associated commentaries, four are poetry and prose anthologies of Chinese poets, calligraphers and Emperor Huizong of Song, four are dictionaries, five are anecdote collections and one is a music score.|$|E

5|$|Starting with Final Fantasy III, Square began {{publishing}} guide {{books for}} its games which traditionally include additional content such as developer interviews and expanded plot and setting information. Studio BentStuff {{wrote the first}} Ultimania book for Final Fantasy VIII in 1999, though the company had been contracted to write Final Fantasy VII True Script Dissection for the previous game. Since then, Ultimania books have been written for every major Final Fantasy title, including Battle Ultimania, Scenario Ultimania, and Ultimania Omega editions for some games. Square experimented with online content delivery with Final Fantasy IX Online Ultimania, but the move was criticized for forcing customers to buy a print guide while releasing {{most of the information}} online. Another online Ultimania was planned for Final Fantasy XI, but it was dropped during development. Square Enix has produced expanded editions to <b>some</b> <b>books,</b> such as Final Fantasy VII 10th Anniversary Ultimania Revised Edition. In addition to the Ultimania series, Square Enix also publishes an Official Complete Guide series of guide books.|$|E
