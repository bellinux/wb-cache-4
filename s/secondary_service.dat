2500|$|The {{standard}} gauge line from Oslo to Hamar {{was extended to}} Otta by 1896. Parliament approved the Dovre Line in 1908, which would see this line extended across Dovrefjell to Støren and onward to Trondheim. The Dovre Line would become the new main train line from Oslo to Trondheim and relegating the Røros Line to a <b>secondary</b> <b>service.</b> Meeting in Støren, the Trondhjem–Støren Line would therefore need to be upgraded to meet the higher standard. This involved a major upgrade to Trondheim Central Station, and installing dual gauge to Støren. The latter was taken into use on ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{the revised}} {{proposal}} was rejected on July 28, Warner Communications and American Express restructured the purchase to include only Viacom as a partner, bowing Gulf and Western and MCA {{out of the}} proposed partnership. The changes – which Justice Department officials acknowledged would [...] "prevent any anti-competitive effect from arising" [...] following the merger, by allowing other premium services to enter the market should the venture significantly raise licensing fee prices for films – led the Justice Department to drop its challenge to the merger agreement on August 12; the Department formally approved the deal the following day on August 13. When the deal was completed on September 6, 1983, the operations of The Movie Channel and Showtime were folded into a new holding company, Showtime/The Movie Channel, Inc., which was majority owned by Viacom (controlling 50% of the venture's common stock as well as investing $40 million in cash), with Warner Communications (which owned 31%) and Warner-Amex (which owned the remaining 19% interest) as minority partners (the operational arrangement between The Movie Channel and Showtime is of a similar relationship to that between rival pay service Starz and its progenitor Starz Encore; as with Starz Encore to Starz, TMC operates as a <b>secondary</b> <b>service</b> to Showtime even though its launch, under the Star Channel brand, predates that of its parent network – Showtime launched on July 1, 1976 – by three years).|$|E

40|$|Secondary serial {{publications}} (abstracting and indexing services) are, {{by their}} nature, {{closely linked to}} the primary journal literature. They are affected by the publication pattern and processes of the primary serials, and developments in technology and communication facilities. In the 1960 s and 1970 s it was generally agreed that <b>secondary</b> <b>services</b> could be divided into disciplines oriented services and mission or project oriented services. This long established division is currently changing as <b>secondary</b> <b>services</b> have become increasingly flexible and more concerned than ever with user requirements. Technological developments and the continuing economic constraints are exerting pressure on the abstracting and indexing service publishers. The convergence of increasingly sophisticated computer systems, improved communication facilities and a growing governmental and public awareness of information technology is having a substantial impact on <b>secondary</b> <b>services.</b> Changes in the use pattern of abstracting and indexing services is causing a migration of income from the printed product to the machine readable data base. Services are available in a variety of formats, can be distributed in a number of physical forms and are being repackaged for reuse. This has led to the emphasis moving away from the traditional discipline/mission orientation. Services are becoming increasingly problem oriented. This changing role of <b>secondary</b> <b>services</b> will be discussed, using as a focal point, a recent U. S. report by Arthur D. Little. This discusses the development of <b>secondary</b> <b>services</b> in terms of three overlapping eras. These are discipline based services; project and mission based services and problem oriented services...|$|R
