We study {{the role that}} <b>short-term</b> <b>debt</b> played {{in the collapse of}} the East Asian financial sector in 1997 - 1998. We alleviate concerns about the endogeneity of <b>short-term</b> <b>debt</b> by using long-term debt obligations that matured during the crisis. We find that debt obligations issued at least three years before the crisis had a negative, albeit sometimes insignificant, effect on the probability of failure. Our results are consistent with the view that <b>short-term</b> <b>debt</b> reflects, rather than causes, distress in financial institutions. ...|$|R

We then examine the incentive for equityholders to increase the firm risk when debtholders rather hold the option to swap their perpetual coupon bond with <b>short-term</b> <b>debt.</b> We find that, compared to standard <b>short-term</b> <b>debt,</b> this restructuring option dramatically limits debtholders expropriation, increases leverage and reduces the loss in tax shields due of asset substitution...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} model of the {{maturity}} of a bank’s uninsured debt. The bank borrows funds and chooses afterwards the riskiness of its assets. This moral hazard problem leads to an excessive level of risk. <b>Short-term</b> <b>debt</b> may have a disciplining effect on the bank’s risk-shifting incentives, but it may lead to inefficient liquidation. We characterize the conditions under which <b>short-term</b> and long-term <b>debt</b> are feasible, and show circumstances under which only <b>short-term</b> <b>debt</b> is feasible and under which <b>short-term</b> <b>debt</b> dominates long-term debt when both are feasible. Thus, <b>short-term</b> <b>debt</b> may have the salutary effect of mitigating the moral hazard problem and inducing lower risk-taking.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Short-term</b> <b>debt</b> {{and credit}} ratings have {{benefits}} for financial reporting quality {{that may be}} associated with lower audit fees. Using U. S. data for 2003 through 2006, we find that <b>short-term</b> <b>debt</b> is negatively related to audit fees for firms rated by Standard & Poor’s, consistent with more monitoring and better governance mechanisms in firms with higher <b>short-term</b> <b>debt.</b> Credit ratings quality is negatively related to audit fees, consistent with ratings quality reflecting a firm’s liquidity risk, governance mechanisms, and monitoring from rating agencies. We also find that the negative relation between <b>short-term</b> <b>debt</b> and audit fees is stronger for firms with low-quality credit ratings, consistent with auditors pricing lender monitoring...|$|R
40|$|We test if {{credit ratings}} {{adequately}} reflect liquidity risk, i. e., {{the risk that}} the firm may face diffi-culty in refinancing its <b>short-term</b> <b>debt.</b> Consistent with credit ratings underestimating liquidity risk, we find that after controlling for credit ratings and other known determinants, long-term bonds of firms with a higher proportion of <b>short-term</b> <b>debt</b> trade at higher yield spreads. Using multi-notch downgrades to identify severe and unexpected rating downgrades, we find that firms with a higher proportion of <b>short-term</b> <b>debt</b> are more likely to experience multi-notch downgrades within a year. The association between <b>short-term</b> <b>debt</b> and multi-notch downgrades is stronger in industries that experience a negative profitability shock, during recessionary periods and when credit conditions are tight. The relationship is robust to instrumenting the proportion of <b>short-term</b> <b>debt.</b> Overall, our results highlight that rating agencies underestimate liquidity risk, and offer a potential explanation for the failure of ratings to predict financial difficulties at firms lik...|$|R

50|$|In February Scullin and Theodore {{presented}} {{a comprehensive plan}} at a conference of the state premiers that attempted to straddle both orthodox and radical approaches. Whilst maintaining heavy budgetary cuts, it also planned to provide economic stimulus to help the unemployed and farmers, as well as repaying <b>short-term</b> <b>debts</b> and overdrafts held by British banks. This would require substantial further funds to be advanced by the Commonwealth Bank, however Gibson soon {{made it clear he}} would not do so unless significant cuts to social spending (particularly pensions) was also implemented. Scullin refused, instead planning to pay for the plan through the expanding the note issue. This 'Theodore Plan' was approved by narrow majorities of the state premiers and then the parliamentary party. However, Jack Lang rejected the plan, stating instead that Australia should default on its British debts until more equitable repayment terms were agreed to. Lyons and the conservatives within the party were horrified, as were the Opposition, seeing note issue as a sure path to hyperinflation and complete economic ruin.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} an empirical {{analysis of the}} capital structure of selected quoted companies in Nigeria between 1990 and 2004. The analyses are performed using panel data pertaining to 50 non-financial firms. Static tests are conducted and panel data specifications are used. Considering the results for all the firms, leverage is negatively correlated with profitability. Tangibility is positively correlated with total debts and long-term debts, but negatively related to <b>short-term</b> <b>debts.</b> In addition, collateral appeared to influence all bank borrowing in Nigeria, whether short-term or long-term. Growth opportunity is positively related to both total debts and <b>short-term</b> <b>debts.</b> The size of the companies is positively correlated with total debts and <b>short-term</b> <b>debts,</b> suggesting that large firms can better support higher debt ratios than small firms. The empirical result shows that debt financing for listed companies in Nigeria corresponds mainly to a <b>short-term</b> <b>debts</b> nature, with a mean value of 60 %. Nigeria firms should adopt appropriate steps to lengthen the maturity structure of corporate debt. In addition, government should endeavour to develop capital market {{to be able to}} absorb the increase in demand for funds...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} total debts, <b>short-term</b> <b>debts</b> and long-term debts on the output, gross investments and technology-upgrading strategies of the firms in certain oligopolistic industries in India. We first develop a simple theoretical model to motivate the analysis. The empirical analysis shows that debt as a whole may {{have a negative impact}} on the choice of output and investment levels of the firms. However, the <b>short-term</b> <b>debts</b> make firms behave in a conservative fashion while the long-term debts make firms behave more aggressively in this respect. Debt, irrespective of its structure, forces the firms to upgrade their technology. Total debt has a negative impact on profitability, however, firms with higher long-term debts have higher profitability...|$|E
40|$|In an {{asymmetric}} information framework, {{a number of}} authors have demonstrated the existence and uniqueness of <b>short-term</b> <b>debt</b> pooling equilibria {{in the absence of}} dissipative costs. We show that <b>short-term</b> <b>debt</b> pooling is robust to a broad range of deviations from stationarity and intertemporal independence. However, with intertemporal dependence, separating equilibria exist in which <b>short-term</b> <b>debt</b> signals favourable information. Non-stationary allows for separating equilibria in which long-term debt signals favourable information. A range of deviations from stationarity and intertemporal independence also support long-term debt pooling equilibria...|$|R
30|$|Firstly, we {{consider}} the effect of information asymmetry on the term of the debt, so we define as dependent variable the ratio of <b>short-term</b> <b>debt</b> to total debt, SHTDBT. We consider as <b>short-term</b> that <b>debt,</b> regardless of its type, which has a maturity of up to 1  year. According to the literature on debt maturity structure, we expect a positive association between ASY and SHTDBT, since, from a borrower perspective, firms facing high information asymmetries and with good private credit quality, can obtain better conditions when renewing their <b>short-term</b> <b>debt,</b> and, from a lender perspective, <b>short-term</b> <b>debt</b> facilitates the monitoring of firms with high information asymmetry.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} capital structure of agro-listed firms in Nigeria, using data generated from the financial statements of twenty eight (28) agro-allied firms, which have been listed in the Nigeria Stock Exchange (NSE) from 2005 to 2010. The major tool for data analysis was Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), which was {{used to analyze the}} identified firm-specific variables that affect short and long term debt ratios. All measured capital structure were scaled by the book value of total assets. In terms of short term debt ratio, large firms were perceived to have enough tangible assets at their disposal to pledge as collateral and access debt capital. Highly tangible firms also use more <b>short-term</b> <b>debts,</b> as high tangible asset reduced the magnitude of debt loss incurred by debt providers if the firms default. Growing listed firms used more short term debts, presumably due to their huge capital requirement for financing new short term investment opportunities and the need to meet current liabilities and other overhead expenses. Growing firms are presumed to lack both tangible assets and cheap long term credit sources of information and as such depends mostly on short term debts. The result further shows agro-listed firms with high taxes use more short term debts in their finances. Highly profitable firms do not depend on <b>short-term</b> <b>debts,</b> as they are perceived to be liquid enough to finance their short term investment through retained earnings at the expense of taking short term debts.

Accounting data of crop, livestock, mixed and service firms are used. First, the efficiencies of the farms are obtained by using nonparametric methods (input-oriented DEA). Then, in a second stage, censored regressions are run with different kinds of explicative variables, including financial ratios. The results show a significative and positive relationship between short-term indebtedness and efficiency, which would be agree with some theories positing that firms with higher short-run obligations make additional efforts to satisfy their payments, and this leads to an improvement of efficiency.

40|$|We {{construct}} {{a model of}} bank’s financing under moral hazard. The bank borrows funds to acquire risky assets, {{and is able to}} choose (or to change) the riskiness of its assets after the borrowing is done, which {{is the source of the}} moral hazard. We ignore deposit insurance, and focus on uninsured bank debt. The moral hazard leads to an excessive level of risk. We show that <b>short-term</b> <b>debt</b> may act as a discipline device when creditors observe some interim signal of the bank’s risk. However, if the signal is noisy <b>short-term</b> <b>debt</b> may lead to inefficient liquidation, so there is a trade-off. We characterize the conditions under which long-term <b>debt</b> and <b>short-term</b> <b>debt</b> (both safe and risky) are feasible, and show that risky <b>short-term</b> <b>debt</b> may be the only way to secure funding and that it may dominate long-term debt (when the latter is feasible) ...|$|R

40|$|Prior {{research}} {{contends that}} weak legal regimes discourage lender enforcement of contracts {{by making it}} either costly or ineffective. However, Diamond observes that this lender passivity can be overcome by structuring <b>debt</b> as a <b>short-term</b> loan. His argument is that an arrival of bad news {{in the presence of}} <b>short-term</b> <b>debt</b> can result in externalities that will trigger a run on the firm and that this in turn creates ex ante incentives for lenders to enforce their contracts. We examine whether <b>short-term</b> <b>debt</b> creates an incentive for borrowers to delay the recognition of bad news through earnings management. Using a sample of firm-level data from 33 countries over a 10 -year period, we find that <b>short-term</b> <b>debt</b> induces greater earnings management. This impact of <b>short-term</b> <b>debt</b> is especially greater in countries with weak legal regimes.
