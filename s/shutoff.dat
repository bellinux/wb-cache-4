5|$|Advanced systems {{played a}} key role in the rig's operation, from {{pressure}} and drill monitoring technology, to automated <b>shutoff</b> systems and modelling systems for cementing. The OptiCem cement modelling system, used by Halliburton in April 2010, played a crucial part in cement slurry mix and support decisions. These decisions became a focus for investigations into the explosion on the rig that month.|$|E
5|$|Alyeska {{and the oil}} {{companies}} fought objections to the pipeline's construction in both the courts and in Congress, where debates about the pipeline's environmental impact statement continued through 1971. Objections about the caribou herds were countered by observations of Davidson Ditch, a water pipeline with the same diameter of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which caribou were able to jump over. To those who argued that the pipeline would irrevocably alter Alaska wilderness, proponents pointed to the overgrown remnants of the Fairbanks Gold Rush, most {{of which had been}} erased 70years later. Some pipeline opponents were satisfied by Alyeska's preliminary design, which incorporated underground and raised crossings for caribou and other big game, gravel and styrofoam insulation to prevent permafrost melting, automatic leak detection and <b>shutoff,</b> and other techniques. Other opponents, including fishermen who feared tanker leaks south of Valdez, maintained their disagreement with the plan.|$|E
5|$|At Ballast Point, the {{pavilion}} and bathhouse {{were destroyed by}} the storm. Nearby, the Tampa Yacht and Country Club suffered severe damage. Many cars along the waterfront were severely damaged and nearly all flat railroad cars were submerged. The Malloy Line dock was also left under several feet of water. A number of waterfront warehouses were also damaged by floodwaters. After the Tampa Electrical Company power house experienced water damage, the electricity was <b>shutoff.</b> Additionally, the company's cable station was flooded under several feet of water. Winds downed hundreds of trees and sign across roadways and tore-up awnings. At least 50 awnings were ripped from a bank building on Franklin Street alone. Falling trees also damaged {{the post office and}} the YMCA. Almost 500 dwellings in the neighborhood of Ybor City were demolished. Five people were killed in the city, three from people coming into contact with a live wire and the other two from drowning. Only minor damage occurred in Plant City. Throughout Hillsborough County, many county roads were impassible due to downed telegraph poles and other debris, especially between Tampa and Plant City.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} days, houses were wooden boards fronted by a four-board-high fence which was fronted with a boardwalk. Most {{of the streets}} were dirt roads. Winters were bitterly cold, and teams of horses {{dragging}} V-shaped wooden plows cleared the streets. In {{the center of town}} was the community pump, from which the village would draw water at stipulated hours. Water was pumped from the mine twice a day through a big open pipe. Everyone had to carry water home during pumping time. There was no <b>shutoff</b> valve, so buckets, tubs and barrels were used for water storage. Later, a water tower was built to hold water drawn from a deep well. St. Bernard dogs helped carry the water from the well to the homes. Running water and bathtubs came only after ditches were dug for pipes to provide water from Gilbert around 1916. Kerosene lamps provided the means of lighting until 1916, when power lines were installed. Initially, the only telephone was at the Elba mine office.|$|E

50|$|Many modern {{computer}} and equipment rooms employ an underfloor air distribution to ensure even cooling {{of the room}} with minimal wasted energy. Conditioned air is provided under the floor and dispersed upward into the room through regularly spaced diffuser tiles, blowers or through ducts directed into specific equipment. Automatic fire protection <b>shutoffs</b> may be required for underfloor ventilation, and additional suppression systems may be installed in case of underfloor fires.|$|R
50|$|These {{systems are}} {{designed}} {{for a wide variety}} of commercial and industrial environments including refineries, industrial processes and warehousing, educational and commercial research facilities as well as hospitals and even restaurants. The systems are designed to both alert and respond - activating warnings and alarms and depending on the extent of the danger, triggering corrective actions that could include material <b>shutoffs,</b> increased ventilation and the opening or closing of access to the exposed area.|$|R
25|$|While {{sometimes}} fires can {{be limited}} to small areas of a structure, wider collateral damage due to smoke, water, and burning embers is common. Utility <b>shutoff</b> (such as gas and electricity) is typically an early priority of arriving fire crews. Furthermore, fire prevention can take on a special meaning for property where hazardous materials are being used or stored.|$|E
25|$|There are two independent, {{fast-acting}} safety {{shutdown systems}} as well. <b>Shutoff</b> rods are held above the reactor by electromagnets, and drop under gravity {{into the core}} to quickly end criticality. This system works even {{in the event of}} a complete power failure, as the electromagnets only hold the rods out of the reactor when power is available. A secondary system injects a high-pressure gadolinium nitrate neutron absorber solution into the calandria.|$|E
25|$|Periodic {{vibration}} of a {{cyclone separator}} would indicate vortex instability. Large centrifugal fans sometimes use radial inlet blades {{that can be}} rotated to control the flow into the fan; they create a swirling flow. At near <b>shutoff,</b> where the swirl is very high, rotating blade stall of the fan blades occurs. Although not researched, it is highly likely that swirl instability is the cause. The feedback is clearly hydrodynamic (Class I) {{and there is no}} indication that more than one stage occurs.|$|E

50|$|Conforte banished Bonavena and Sally Burgess {{from the}} ranch two days later. They were warned to stay away, and guards {{were ordered to}} stop them if they tried to re-enter. Conforte {{moved out of the}} family house in town he shared with Sally, and into the Blue Room. Willard Ross Brymer, Conforte's ex-convict {{personal}} bodyguard and security guard at the ranch, was recalled from a trip. Brymer cleaned out Bonavena's trailer, and burned his papers and clothes in the street. At the family house, Sally was plagued by utility <b>shutoffs</b> and other harassment.|$|R
25|$|The early {{proteins}} transcribed {{are used}} in the regulation of genetic replication of the virus. On entering the cell, an Î±-TIF protein joins the viral particle and aids in immediate-early transcription. The virion host <b>shutoff</b> protein (VHS or UL41) is very important to viral replication. This enzyme shuts off protein synthesis in the host, degrades host mRNA, helps in viral replication, and regulates gene expression of viral proteins. The viral genome immediately travels to the nucleus but the VHS protein remains in the cytoplasm.|$|E
25|$|A {{second stage}} freeze {{is also likely}} to happen with the valve open, causing a free flow, which may {{precipitate}} a first stage freeze if not immediately stopped. If the flow through the frozen second stage can be stopped before the first stage freezes, the process can be halted. This may be possible if the second stage is fitted with a <b>shutoff</b> valve, but if this is done, the first stage must be fitted with an overpressure valve, as closing the supply to the second stage disables its secondary function as an overpressure valve.|$|E
25|$|The main {{circulating}} pumps {{have the capacity}} of 5,500â12,000mÂ³/h and are powered by 6kV electric motors. The normal coolant flow is 8000mÂ³/h per pump; this is throttled down by control valves to 6000â7000mÂ³/h when the reactor power is below 500MWt. Each pump has a flow control valve and a backflow preventing check valve on the outlet, and <b>shutoff</b> valves on both inlet and outlet. Each of the pressure channels in the core has its own flow control valve so that the temperature distribution in the reactor core can be optimized. Each channel has a ball type flow meter.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} {{focuses on}} automatic control strategy of direct air-cooling system for 660 MW thermal power plants. The aim of the controller is to maintain the backpressure in an adjustable range. The speed control policy takes the backpressure to the controllable range by adjusting the running fan speed, and the sequential control policy starts or <b>shutoffs</b> the pre specified fans when the backpressure {{is out of the}} normal range.

25|$|The ground-maintenance crew {{locked out}} the thrust {{reverser}} for engine #3 (treated as a {{minimum equipment list}} item) because of technical problems with the thrust reverser sensors during the landing of TWA 881 at JFK, prior to Flight 800's departure. Additionally, severed cables for the engine #3 thrust reverser were replaced. During refueling of the aircraft, the volumetric <b>shutoff</b> (VSO) control was {{believed to have been}} triggered before the tanks were full. To continue the pressure fueling, a TWA mechanic overrode the automatic VSO by pulling the volumetric fuse and an overflow circuit breaker. Maintenance records indicate that the airplane had numerous VSO-related maintenance writeups in the weeks before the accident.|$|E
25|$|On September 8, 2008, at 12 noon, WWAY, WECT, WSFX, WILM-LP and W51CW {{all turned}} off their analog signals, making Wilmington the first {{market in the}} nation to go digital-only as part of a test by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to iron out {{transition}} and reception concerns before the nationwide <b>shutoff.</b> Wilmington was chosen as the test market because the area's digital channel positions will remain unchanged after the transition. As the area's official conduit of emergency information, WUNJ did not participate in the early analog switchoff, and kept their analog signal on until the national digital switchover date of June 12, 2009. W47CK did not participate due to its low-power status; FCC rules currently exempt low-powered stations from the 2009 analog shutdown. WILM-LP and W51CW chose to participate, even though they are exempt as LPTV stations.|$|E
25|$|Toyota {{recalled}} {{and replaced}} 55,000 optional all-weather rubber floor mats from the Toyota Camry and ES 350 in September 2007, citing {{the risk of}} unsecured mats jamming the accelerator pedal. In August 2009, the NHTSA probed the ES 350 following 40 acceleration control complaints, eight crashes and 12 injuries, with floor mats implicated in most cases. An accident involving a loaner ES 350 killed four persons near San Diego on 28 August. The NHTSA and San Diego County Sheriff's Department found that the car was wrongly fitted with an unsecured SUV rubber floor mat; the mat had jammed the accelerator, which an earlier driver had complained about. On 29 September, a Toyota safety notice advised floor mat removal, shift to Neutral (N) gear in an emergency, with a 3-second push button ignition press for engine <b>shutoff.</b> On 29 November, the 2007â2010 MY floor mat recall was revised to add shorter accelerator pedals, thinner replacement mats, and a brake override feature which ignores accelerator input when the brake pedal is depressed.|$|E

5000|$|By all {{accounts}} Georgia's transition from monopoly to market competition {{has been very}} contentious. Several problems have plagued the deregulation process from the beginning, and unusually high gas prices have recently exacerbated the situation. As facilitator of the deregulation process, the GPSC has played a high-profile role in several disputes. First, early in the deregulation process, the GPSC settled several [...] "slamming" [...] cases with marketers. Slamming occurs when companies switch customers without their authorization. Second, after several marketers persistently billed customers incorrectly, the GPSC resolved the billing disputes. Third, in November 2000 several marketers threatened to shut off service for nonpayment of bills. The GPSC voted unanimously to impose an immediate moratorium through April 1, 2001, on <b>shutoffs</b> of gas service for residential customers. In January 2001, in a three-to-two vote, the GPSC overrode protests from natural-gas marketers and enacted emergency rules to allow consumers who owe money in back bills to switch to marketers with lower prices.|$|R
