The {{majority of the}} Palestinian people view him as a heroic freedom fighter and martyr who <b>symbolized</b> <b>the</b> national aspirations of his people.

5|$|Akizzi {{contacted}} Egypt {{and declared}} himself a servant to the pharaoh. An anti-Hittite coalition, probably organized by Akizzi, was established.

Šuppiluliuma himself came to Qatna, aided by Aziru of Amurru. The Hittite monarch took with him a statue of the sun deity, which {{had been given to}} Qatna by an ancestor of Akhenaten.

5|$|During the Postclassic period, {{the most}} common form of human {{sacrifice}} was heart extraction, influenced by the method used by the Aztecs in the Valley of Mexico; this usually took place in the courtyard of a temple, or upon the summit of the pyramid. Depending upon the exact ritual, sometimes the corpse would be skinned by assistant priests, except for the hands and feet. The officiating priest would then remove his ritual attire and dress himself in the skin of the sacrificial victim before performing a ritual dance that <b>symbolized</b> <b>the</b> rebirth of life. Archaeological investigations indicate that heart sacrifice was practised as early as the Classic period.|$|E

5|$|In his Cronica, Villani {{writes that}} the Guelph defeat by the Ghibellines at Montaperti in 1260 was a major setback to the {{historical}} progress of the Republic of Florence. In this civil war, the Guelphs were a faction united with the papacy in Rome, while the Ghibellines were allied with the descendants of Emperor Frederick II of the Holy Roman Empire and supported by Siena. According to Villani, the Florentine Guelphs' last stand was in defending the Carroccio, a chariot which <b>symbolized</b> <b>the</b> independence of the Commune of Florence. Villani estimated that 2,500 Florentine troops were killed and 1,500 captured during the battle, which Roberta J.M. Olson states are conservative numbers in regards to subsequent historians writing of the battle's casualties.|$|E
5|$|In many cultures, {{including}} in Europe, bats {{are associated with}} darkness, death, witchcraft, and malevolence. Because bats are mammals, yet can fly, they are liminal beings in many traditions. Among Native Americans such as the Creek, Cherokee and Apache, the bat is a trickster spirit. In Tanzania, a winged bat cryptid known as Popobawa, {{is believed to be}} a shapeshifting evil spirit that assaults and sodomises its victims. In Aztec mythology, bats <b>symbolized</b> <b>the</b> land of the dead, destruction, and decay. An East Nigerian tale tells that the bat developed its nocturnal habits after causing the death of his partner, the bush-rat, and now hides by day to avoid arrest.|$|E
5|$|Festivals often {{involved}} a ceremonial procession {{in which a}} cult image was carried out of the temple in a barque-shaped shrine. These processions served various purposes. In Roman times, when local deities of all kinds were believed to have power over the Nile inundation, processions in many communities carried temple images to the riverbanks so the gods could invoke a large and fruitful flood. Processions also traveled between temples, as when the image of Hathor from Dendera Temple visited her consort Horus at the Temple of Edfu. Rituals for a god were often based in that deity's mythology. Such rituals {{were meant to be}} repetitions of the events of the mythic past, renewing the beneficial effects of the original events. In the Khoiak festival in honor of Osiris, his death and resurrection were ritually reenacted at a time when crops were beginning to sprout. The returning greenery <b>symbolized</b> <b>the</b> renewal of the god's own life.|$|E

5|$|Only Roman {{citizens}} (both plebeians and patricians) had {{the right}} to confer magisterial powers (potestas) on any individual magistrate. The most important power was imperium, which was held by consuls (the chief magistrates) and by praetors (the second highest-ranking ordinary magistrate). Defined narrowly, imperium simply gave a magistrate the authority to command a military force. Defined more broadly, however, imperium gave a magistrate the constitutional authority to issue commands (military, diplomatic, civil, or otherwise). A magistrate's imperium was at its apex while the magistrate was abroad. While the magistrate was in the city of Rome itself, however, he had to completely surrender his imperium, so that liberty (libertas) was maximized. Magistrates with imperium sat in a curule chair, and were attended by lictors (bodyguards) who carried axes called fasces which <b>symbolized</b> <b>the</b> power of the state to punish and to execute. Only a magistrate with imperium could wear a bordered toga, or be awarded a triumph.|$|E
5|$|The electors of Cardinal Rolando, {{immediately}} after proclaiming him Pope, attempted to place upon him the purple mantle which <b>symbolized</b> <b>the</b> {{assumption of the}} papal office, but then the election entered the tumultuous stage. Cardinal Ottaviano Monticelli snatched the mantle from Alexander’s back and his armed bands burst into the basilica. Alexander III and his supporters fled to the citadel of St. Peter, {{which was in the}} hands of Cardinal Boso. In their absence, the few cardinals who remained in basilica elected Ottaviano of S. Cecilia to the papacy and enthroned him as Victor IV. The exact number of his electors is not known, but there are good reasons to believe that it amounted six, including Ottaviano himself, since only five cardinals signed the manifest in his favour in the following month. However, it is possible that some additional cardinals participated in the election of Victor IV but very quickly joined the obedience Alexander III.|$|E
5|$|Boy Scouting uses {{a series}} of medals and patches as emblems. The badge for the Scout rank {{consists}} of a simple fleur-de-lis, which symbolizes a compass needle. The needle points the Scout in the right direction, which is onward and upward. The Tenderfoot badge takes the fleur-de-lis of the Scout badge and adds two stars and an eagle with an American shield. The stars symbolize truth and knowledge; the eagle and shield symbolize freedom and readiness to defend it. The Second Class badge features a scroll inscribed with the Scout Motto, with the ends turned up and a knotted rope hanging from the bottom. The knot reminds each Scout to remember the Scout slogan, and the upturned ends of the scroll symbolize cheerfulness in service. The First Class badge combines {{the elements of the}} Tenderfoot and Second Class badges. For years, the First Class badge was used as the emblem of the BSA. Star has a First Class symbol on a five-pointed yellow star, and initially indicated the five merit badges required to earn the rank. Life has a First Class emblem on a red heart, and initially <b>symbolized</b> <b>the</b> first-aid and health-related merit badges that the rank required.
