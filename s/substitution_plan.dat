The aim is to support remote energy management systems. The plan is managed by the Ministry of Industry, with a deadline for {{the completion of the}} plan by 31 December 2018. All DSOs had to submit their substitution plans to the regional governments. A binding target of 30% of all customers was set for 2010. This initial target could not be reached by any of the DSOs, however, due to a late approval of the <b>substitution</b> <b>plan</b> (in May 2009), technological uncertainties in terms of system communication, alleged supply problems of certified meters that were available only in June 2010 and ongoing negotiations with the regulators about the level of cost acceptance.|$|E
40|$|The article {{provides}} a short review of influence of geoeconomic {{restrictions on the}} economy and industrial policy of the Russian Federation. The authors mention the list of economically restricted companies with the indication of their industry affiliation. The characteristic of import dependence scales in key industries of the Russian economy is given. The mechanism of influence of geoeconomic restrictions on economic and social situation in Russia is shown on the example of the food market. It is proved that the agro-industrial complex couldn’t replenish the shortage at the domestic food market. The authors also point to strengths and weaknesses of import substitution policy in the economy and the social sphere of national economy. The main directions ofimport substitution policy in the Russian Federation are revealed with the indication of standard and legal documents, in which they are enshrined. The comparative analysis of import <b>substitution</b> <b>plans</b> of regions of the North Caucasian Federal District is carried out. The plans include such provisions as branch priorities, accounting of the developed branch structure of economy, strengths and weaknesses. From the authors’ viewpoint, the import <b>substitution</b> <b>plans</b> of the Republics of Dagestan, Karachay-Cherkess Republic, the Republic of Northern Ossetia, the Chechen Republic are the most developed, as they take into account branch structure and promote regional growth. In these documents the directions of further deepening of regional specialization of an access into the markets of other regions of Russia are proved. It is noted that there are measures of regional policy, which have been used within the last decades and have not proved their efficiency. The authors make a valid conclusion about the insufficient innovation of regional <b>plans</b> of import <b>substitution</b> in the North Caucasian Federal District that hinders development and search of a niche for each of the regions in the system of national and international division of labour...|$|R

40|$|The neoclassical {{model is}} still the most useful theory of growth we have. It will {{continue}} to be the fi rst growth model taught to students and the fi rst growth model used by policy analysts. —Gregory Mankiw, “The Growth of Nations ” (1995) The 1940 s and 1950 s were an exciting and remarkably productive period in the fi elds of economic development and economic growth. A rich and prolifi c literature featured some of the most infl uential and well-known contributions in the history of economics.

Against this background, by far the most infl uential and durable con-tribution to the analysis of economic growth was Robert Solow’s 1956 paper, “A Contribution to the Theory of Economic Growth, ” which estab-lished the benchmark neoclassical growth model.

40|$|RDF, {{the high}} caloriﬁc value {{fraction}} of MSW obtained by conventional separation systems, {{can be employed}} in technological plants (mainly cement kilns) {{in order to obtain}} a useful energy recovery. It is interesting and important to evaluate this possibility within the general framework of waste-to-energy solutions. The solution must be assessed on the basis of diﬀerent aspects, namely: technological features and clinker characteristics; local atmospheric pollution; the eﬀects of RDF used in cement kilns on the generation of greenhouse gases; the economics of conventional solid fuels <b>substitution</b> and <b>planning</b> perspectives, {{from the point of view}} of the destination of RDF and optimal cement kiln policy. The diﬀerent experiences of this issue throughout Europe are reviewed, and some applications within Italy are also been considered. The main ﬁndings of the study are that the use of RDF in cement kilns instead of coal or coke oﬀers environmental beneﬁts in terms of greenhouse gases, while the formation of conventional gaseous pollutants is not a critical aspect. Indeed, the generation of nitrogen oxides can probably be lower because of lower ﬂame temperatures or lower air excess. The presence of chlorinated micro-pollutants is not inﬂuenced by the presence of RDF in fuel, whereas depending on the quality of the RDF, some problems could arise compared to the substituted fuel as far as heavy metals are concerned, chieﬂy the more volatile one...|$|R

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{challenges}} and difficulties arising when approaching and modelling the consumer-directed substitution problem in quick response supply chains. Further, we propose heuristic solutions suited for large problems with complex uncertainty and dependency patterns. Despite the single-period newsvendor model we use, our substitution process is an approximation of the dynamic product choice. To ensure consistency {{with regard to the}} information used to establish substitution fractions and information available at the time of optimisation, substitution fraction estimation and inventory/assortment optimisation are discussed simultaneously. The decision-independent substitution preferences applied here do not require inventory or sales transaction data, but reflect understanding on the demand driver attributes. This approach, in turn, leads to increased robustness in assortment <b>planning.</b> Factual <b>substitution</b> is an outcome of the optimisation process, constrained by the available substitutes and unfulfilled demand. Despite being unable to fully describe the dependencies among the substitute choice possibilities, our substitution approach, together with the modelling process, allows handling the most important dependencies, such as negatively correlated substitute choice possibilities and positively/negatively correlated first and second choice possibilities.

40|$|Despite the {{paramount}} {{importance of the}} steel rolling industry and its vital contributions to a nation’s economic growth and pace of development, production planning in this industry has not received {{as much attention as}} opposed to other industries. The work presented in this thesis tackles the master production scheduling (MPS) problem encountered frequently in steel rolling mills producing reinforced steel bars of different grades and dimensions. At first, the production planning problem is dealt with under static demand conditions and is formulated as a mixed integer bilinear program (MIBLP) where the objective of this deterministic model is to provide insights into the combined effect of several interrelated factors such as batch production, scrap rate, complex setup time structure, overtime, backlogging and product <b>substitution,</b> on the <b>planning</b> decisions. Typically, MIBLPs are not readily solvable using off-the-shelf optimization packages necessitating the development of specifically tailored solution algorithms that can efficiently handle this class of models. The classical linearization approaches are first discussed and employed to the model at hand, and then a hybrid linearization-Benders decomposition technique is developed in order to separate the complicating variables from the non-complicating ones. As a third alternative, a modified Branch-and-Bound (B&B) algorithm is proposed where the branching, bounding and fathoming criteria differ from those of classical B&B algorithms previously established in the literature. Numerical experiments have shown that the proposed B&B algorithm outperforms the other two approaches for larger problem instances with savings in computational time amounting to 48...|$|R

However tension remained, as proven {{at the end of}} the month when it was reported that Gannon left the team bus on a pre-match journey after rowing with assistant manager Geoff Horsfield. Gannon had previously told the press his staff were 'underqualified', though insisted any changes would be 'implemented at a later stage' and that Horsfield was a 'great assistant'. It was later reported in the national media that Horsfield had requested a day off to deal with a family matter, Gannon then granted him permission but subsequently wrote a letter to the board complaining of his conduct. An unnamed director then handed the letter to Horsfield, who confronted Gannon over the issue, brandishing the letter as proof when Gannon denied its existence. This came on the same day that local paper The Sentinel ran an editorial that questioned his loan signings, his decision to drop Gary Roberts and branded his tactics and team selections as baffling. Having returned to the team to steer his side to a 2–1 victory over Aldershot, Gannon said [...] "there's been misrepresentation in the media over my part in this. I'm completely the innocent party". The club informed Horsfield that he would face a disciplinary hearing, whilst Gannon would not be asked to defend his actions and would merely provide a witness statement. The club took no action, and after Horsfield spent two weeks at home the pair returned to work as before. He continued to exploit the loan market, signing Dominic Blizzard from Bristol Rovers, a midfielder who played under him at Stockport.|$|R
