5000|$|Leman {{was born}} in Pomona, California, {{and grew up in}} Ninilchik, Alaska, in a Russian-speaking family of Alutiiq and Russian ancestry. They were {{commercial}} fishermen. He watched his father operate a fish trap during Territorial days, before this fishing method was outlawed by referendum in 1959. He subsequently has worked the family salmon <b>setnet</b> operation on Cook Inlet near Ninilchik. He longlined for halibut in Cook Inlet and harvested herring roe on kelp in Prince William Sound. Leman traces his long family history in Alaska to the marriage in Kodiak in 1798 between a Russian shipbuilder and an Alutiiq woman from Afognak.|$|E
50|$|The New Zealand sand {{flounder}} {{is a popular}} fish caught by humans to eat. Recreational fishers catch the fish usually in beach seines, setnets or with spears. The Maori used wooden spears to catch what they called ‘Patiki’ at night on mud flats. They would attract the ‘Patiki’ by light from a torch made of pine, spearing them with ease. Commercially {{sand flounder}} are fished by trawl and <b>setnet.</b> Sand flounder {{is very easy to}} cook and {{there are many ways to}} cook and serve it depending on preferences. At its simplest, it can be served beautifully after washing, drenching in flour and frying each side in a medium hot pan with oil/butter until the skin is crisp. At the moment, sand flounder numbers are decreasing, but there is no evidence to show that the decline is rapid and they are still common in areas where they are found. So, because of this, they have been classed as Least Concern on the red list category and criteria. For these reasons, there is no current conservation effort to try save sand flounder, but as it is one of the most important commercial fishes in New Zealand ongoing research on the harvest levels and population numbers of this species is needed to make sure that they do not leave the Least Concern class and so that they know if they do, conservation efforts can be made.|$|E
40|$|AbstractCompetition with {{fisheries}} and incidental capture in fishing gear {{are the major}} current threats for seabirds at sea. Fishing is a traditional activity in Portugal and is mainly composed of {{a great number of}} small vessels. Given the lack of knowledge on effects of the Portuguese fishing fleet on seabird populations, bycatch was assessed in mainland coastal waters for 2010 – 2012. Interviews and on-board data were divided into 5 strata, according to fishing gear: Bottom trawling, Bottom longline, Purse seine, Beach seine, Polyvalent (≥ 12  m) and Polyvalent (< 12  m). Polyvalent included <b>Setnets,</b> Traps and Demersal longlines. Overall, 68 birds were recorded to be bycaught. The average catch per unit effort (CPUE) was 0. 05 birds per fishing event. Polyvalent (< 12  m), Polyvalent (≥ 12  m) and Purse seiners had the biggest seabird bycatch rates, with 0. 5 (CPUE= 0. 1), 0. 11 (CPUE= 0. 05) and 0. 2 (CPUE= 0. 11) birds per trip, respectively. Within Polyvalent gear, <b>Setnets</b> captured the largest diversity of seabird species (CPUE= 0. 06), while Demersal longline had the highest CPUE (0. 86). Northern gannet was the most common bycaught species. Although more observation effort is required, our results suggest that substantial numbers of Balearic shearwater might be bycaught annually, mainly in Purse seine and <b>Setnets...</b>|$|R
25|$|Both drift {{gillnets}} and <b>setnets</b> {{have long been}} used by cultures around the world. There is evidence of fisheries exploitation, including gillnetting, going far back in Japanese history, with many specific details available from the Edo period (1603–1868). Fisheries in the Shetland Islands, which were settled by Norsemen during the Viking age, share cultural and technological similarities with Norwegian fisheries, including gillnet fisheries for herring. Many of the Norwegian immigrant fishermen who came to fish in the great Columbia River salmon fishery {{during the second half}} of the 19th century did so because they had experience in the gillnet fishery for cod in the waters surrounding the Lofoten Islands of northern Norway. Gillnets were used as part of the seasonal round by Swedish fishermen as well. Welsh and English fishermen gillnetted for Atlantic salmon in the rivers of Wales and England in coracles, using hand-made nets, for at least several centuries. These are but a few of the examples of historic gillnet fisheries around the world.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} how best to visualize network data grouped into overlapping sets. We address it by evaluating various existing techniques alongside a new technique. Such data arise in many areas, including social network analysis, gene expression data, and crime analysis. We begin by investigating the strengths and weakness of four existing techniques, namely Bubble Sets, EulerView, KelpFusion, and LineSets, using principles from psychology and known layout guides. Using insights gained, we propose a new technique, <b>SetNet,</b> that may overcome limitations of earlier methods. We conducted a comparative crowdsourced user study to evaluate all five techniques based on tasks that require information from both the network and the sets. We established that EulerView and <b>SetNet,</b> both of which draw the sets first, yield significantly faster user responses than Bubble Sets, KelpFusion and LineSets, all of which draw the network first...|$|E

30|$|At least 29 {{species of}} flyingfish in seven genera are {{reportedly}} {{found in the}} waters off Taiwan and adjacent areas (Chang et al. 2012 a). Among these, Hirundichthys oxycephalus (bony flyingfish) {{is one of the}} dominant flyingfishes in the Kuroshio Current (Chang et al. 2012 b). The fish can be found from south of Taiwan to northwestern Japan (Ichimaru 2007; Chang et al. 2012 b); however, it has not been found in the Philippines according to a 3 -year sampling program conducted in Batanes (SK Chang and CH Lin, unpublished data). The fish was utilized as the main source of eggs for flyingfish egg fisheries in northern Taiwan and the bait of longline and troll fisheries in eastern Taiwan (Chang et al. 2012 a, b). Juveniles of the fish also constituted an important target of boat seine and <b>setnet</b> fisheries in northwestern Japan (Ichimaru 2007). A decline of more than 60 % in catches of the fish and its eggs occurred in Taiwan during the 2006 to 2007 period (Fisheries Agency 2010). This decline has caused serious concerns regarding the fish stock status and prompted the Taiwan government to implement a set of regulations on flyingfish egg fishery since 2008, including an annual catch limit. The catch limit regulation is precautionary, however, and has no scientific support regarding the optimal fish stock abundance or, more basically, on the boundary of the fish population that is crucial for effective fishery management (Garcia 2005). Therefore, the population structure of H. oxycephalus needs to be resolved urgently in order to confirm if the population is trans-boundary and is exploited by more than one country.|$|E
40|$|Study {{on fishing}} {{operation}} of fyke net {{was conducted at}} reef waters at {{the west coast of}} Selayar Island from November 2008 to October 2010. The main objective of this research is to determine the best design and technical operation for environmental friendly catching of reef fish. Fyke net is chosen as an experimental fishing gear because its shape is a combination between basket trapnet ???bubu???, traditional fishing gear which is cosidered as environmental friendly fishing gear for catching coral reef fish and fence <b>setnet</b> (sero) shape. The first design of the experimantal fyke net follows the original shape, support with 5 rectangular steel frames and surrounding by 0. 75 inch of webbing 5 m in length, 1. 8 m in width and 1. 2 m in height. It has two 2 m fixed and 15 m flexible extended wings. Unlike ???bubu???, fyke net has not use bait for attracting the fish, therefore the entrance of fyke net should be large enough to make the fish entering freely. In two months of operations the fyke net did not show satisfactory results because the fish moved back and forward through the entrance of fyke net easily and the main problem was bycatch of turtels, therefore the second fyke net was designed. The new feature of the second fyke net was playground with rectangular vertical opening. The size of the opening was 150 x 15 cm devided into seven small entrances {{in order to protect the}} turtles entering the gear. To keep the fish inside the playground some 40 cm cableties are tied at the frame of the entrance functioning as shieves. In two months of operations the second fyke net was show better results however the new problem was the weight of the gear became heavier because of the increase of diameter of steelframe used, therefore, the third fyke net was designed to find a lighter gear. The third fyke net was supported by a rectangular polyvinil chloride (PVC) tube frames combined by polyethylene ropes, covered by 1. 25 inch of webbing. No more turtles was caught but more life reef fish was caught. To evaluate which design and methods of operation was better, three types of fyke nets and two methods of operations were examined. RAPFISH (Rapid Appraisal of Fish Status) is used to analyze which type of fyke net is the most suitable for reef fishing and to analyze the status of fyke net as an environmental friendly fishing gear. RAPFISH applies a statistical ordination technique called multi-dimensional scaling (MDS). Based on this analysis the third fyke net, lighter gear with PVC tube frames, shows the best value for it performance and technical operations, and fyke net is an environmental friendly fishing gear (value > 50. 0 in the range of 0 - 100). Ecological aspects gave the highest value for the status of fyke net as an environmental friendly fishing gear followed by ethical, technological, social and economical aspects...|$|E
