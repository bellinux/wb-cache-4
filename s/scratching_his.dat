5|$|Camping for {{the night}} on a riverbank, Andrei and Foma are {{collecting}} firewood for their group when Andrei hears the distant sounds of celebration further upstream in the woods. Going to investigate he encounters {{a large group of}} naked pagans, who are conducting a torch lit ritual for Midsummer. Andrei is intrigued and excited by the behaviour of the pagans but is caught spying on a couple making love, is tied to the crossbeam of a hut in a mockery of Jesus' crucifixion and is threatened with drowning in the morning. A woman named Marfa (Nelly Snegina), dressed only in a fur coat approaches Andrei. After explaining that her people are persecuted for their beliefs she drops her coat, kisses Andrei and then unties him. Andrei runs away, and is lost in the dense woods, <b>scratching</b> <b>his</b> face. The next morning Andrei returns to his group, including Daniil, and as they leave on their boats a group of soldiers appear on the riverbank chasing after several of the pagans including Marfa. Her partner is captured but she makes her naked escape by swimming into the river past Andrei’s boat. He and his fellow monks look away in shame.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{released}} on 3 July 2006. Having been directed by Sophie Muller, it contained a vengeance theme, {{similar to that of}} the song. It starts off with Allen sitting on the bed in her apartment, eating chocolate and cheeseballs. Interleaved, there are shots of her and her ex-boyfriend spending time together appear as a memory. He is played by Elliott Jordan. As the bridge comes up, the scene changes to the singer standing on the corner of a street, talking to a man and paying him money. The man leaves and goes to some gangsters, giving them instructions and each a share of money. As Allen's former lover walks down the street talking on his mobile phone, one of the gangsters pushes him into an abandoned playground; where they are joined by a second gangster, and the pair give Allen's ex a beating. In this time, Allen, witnessing the scene, smiles. She then meets with her bruised ex-boyfriend, and takes him to a coffee shop. There, he tried to explain to her how he was beaten by the muggers, not knowing that, meanwhile, they were breaking down his apartment door and destroying his furniture and possessions, including <b>scratching</b> <b>his</b> gramophone records. The ex-boyfriend leaves the table for a while, enough time for Allen to put laxative pills in his coffee; upon returning, he drinks it and leaves the shop. After, he goes to his apartment, only to find it trashed and destroyed. Scavenging through what's left, he happily finds the record box, thinking they are intact, but he suddenly gets diarrhoea as a result of the laxatives, but is unable to use his toilet, as it is clogged with his clothes. He goes to Allen's apartment with his records, seeking consolation, unaware that she is laughing behind his back. As the video finishes, the scene changes to Allen walking down the street, at night, smiling, singing the last chorus, while her ex-boyfriend, actually a disc jockey, is in a nightclub, getting ready to put his music, but finds out that all his records have been scratched.|$|E
25|$|The {{individual}} {{engages in}} the behavior because it produces a decrease in aversive stimulation. Put another way, something aversive is occurring in some location on the organism's body, and engaging {{in the behavior}} decreases the level of discomfort. For example, a child bangs {{his head against the}} wall to decrease the pain experienced from a toothache. Another example includes a child <b>scratching</b> <b>his</b> arm to decrease the level of itchiness experienced from a bug bite. Common forms of aversive stimulation abated by engaging in specific behaviors include sinus pain, itching, hunger, etc.|$|E

25|$|On May 1, 2004, Yzerman {{was hit in}} the eye by a {{deflected}} slapshot by the Calgary Flames defenceman Rhett Warrener in {{a playoff}} game, breaking his orbital bone and <b>scratching</b> <b>his</b> cornea. Yzerman underwent eye surgery following the incident, and was sidelined {{for the rest of the}} 2004 post-season. The eye injury also forced Yzerman to miss the 2004 World Cup of Hockey. Fellow Canadians Joe Thornton (then of the Boston Bruins) and Joe Sakic (Colorado), who each wore the number 19 for their respective NHL clubs and who were now eligible to wear it for team Canada due to Yzerman's enforced absence, both refused the number out of respect for their injured countryman. Yzerman returned in the 2005–06 season, following the labour lock-out in 2004–05, wearing a face shield.|$|E
500|$|Starved of {{inspiration}} and suffering writer's block, the poet {{sits on the}} end of his bed in his night gown, quill in hand, <b>scratching</b> <b>his</b> head. [...] A copy of Edward Bysshe's The Art of English Poetry, a guide to composition published in 1702, lies open on the table. A copy of Popes's satirical Grub Street Journal lies on the floor near his feet.|$|E
500|$|The Distrest Poet is an oil {{painting}} produced sometime around 1736 by the British artist William Hogarth. Reproduced as an etching and engraving, {{it was published}} in 1741 from a third state plate produced in 1740. The scene was probably inspired by Alexander Pope's satirical poem The Dunciad. [...] It depicts a scene in a small, dingy attic room where a poet sits at his desk in the dormer and, <b>scratching</b> <b>his</b> head, stares at the papers on the desk before him, evidently looking for inspiration to complete the poem he is writing. [...] Near him sits his wife darning clothes, surprised by the entrance of a milkmaid, who impatiently demands payment of debts.|$|E

500|$|The critic Michael Billington, {{writing in}} The Guardian, gave a mixed review: [...] "Once or twice one of Stoppard's brightly {{coloured}} balls {{falls to the}} ground, partly because Michael Hordern's moral philosopher substitutes academic mannerism for apprehension of the argument. But {{this is not to}} deny that Hordern's simian habit of <b>scratching</b> <b>his</b> left earlobe with right hand or leaning over his desk as if he is doing intellectual press-ups is very funny to watch or that he is brilliant at displaying cuckolded curiosity." [...] Harold Hobson, the drama critic, thought that failing to enjoy the play was [...] "not actually a criminal offence but it is a sad evidence of illiteracy". Jumpers won the Evening Standard 's Best Play Award which, much to Hordern's amusement, was presented by the philosopher A. J. Ayer.|$|E
500|$|Crash was genetically {{engineered}} {{through the use}} of Cortex and Doctor Nitrus Brio's Evolvo-Ray. Before escaping from Doctor Neo Cortex's island fortress, Crash became romantically attached to a female bandicoot named Tawna, who was another one of Cortex's experiments. Crash's separation from Tawna at the hands of Cortex serves as the primary root of Crash's antagonisation of Cortex. Crash is a very emotional character who is quick to laugh and quick to cry. While he has a danger-loving, fearless nature and loves a good fight, he prefers relaxing in the sun and rarely seeks out trouble deliberately. Crash has an extremely limited vocabulary, preferring to speak in unintelligible gibberish; the few English words he is capable of speaking include [...] "Whoa!" [...] (which he often exclaims upon being physically harmed), [...] "Nina" [...] and [...] "pancakes". To the ire of his friend Crunch, but the amusement of his sister Coco, Crash is prone to impolite personal habits such as belching or <b>scratching</b> <b>his</b> posterior.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{contains}} several {{references to}} popular culture. The {{title of the}} episode is a spoof of the book The Joy of Sex by Alex Comfort. When Marge attempts to leave the compound, she is chased by the Rover guard [...] "balloon" [...] from the 1967 television program The Prisoner. Neal Hefti and Nelson Riddle's theme music to the 1960s Batman series {{is used in the}} episode to indoctrinate Homer, while [...] "I Love You, You Love Me" [...] sung by Barney the Dinosaur on the Barney and Friends/Barney and the Backyard Gang series is used to brainwash babies. When Mr. Burns introduces his new religion, most of the sequence is a parody of the promotional video of Michael Jackson's 1995 album [...] Willie <b>scratching</b> <b>his</b> nails along the church window to get Marge and Reverend Lovejoy's attention is a reference to the 1975 film Jaws, in which the character Quint performs a similar action. The Springfield Airport contains the [...] "Just Crichton and King Bookstore", referencing Michael Crichton and Stephen King, authors famous for their airport novels, carrying only their works.|$|E
5000|$|Now the sloppy {{reading of}} the {{sentence}} arises, where John <b>scratched</b> <b>his</b> arm (John’s arm) and Bob <b>scratched</b> <b>his</b> arm (Bob’s arm).

500|$|Following {{the release}} of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] on March 3, 1989, it {{received}} widespread acclaim from critics, journalists and academics. Taraborrelli commented that the track [...] "deserved every bit of the curiosity it generated. While being devilishly danceable, the song also shows Madonna's uncanny ability to inspire strong, conflicting emotions {{during the course of}} a single song, leaving the listener <b>scratching</b> <b>his</b> head for answers—and craving for more." [...] Stephen Holden from The New York Times, while writing about Madonna's re-invention of her image, observed how her sound had changed from the [...] "simple blaring dance-pop to the rich, fully rounded pop of 'Like a Prayer". Lucy O'Brien felt that the most remarkable aspect of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] was Madonna's usage of liturgical words. [...] "There is the surface meaning, forging sexuality with pop lyrics that sound so sweet. But underlying that is a rigorous mediation on prayer. In shorter words, 'Like a Prayer' really takes you there," [...] she concluded. This view was shared by Mary Cross, who wrote in her biography of Madonna that [...] "the song is a mix of the sacred and the profane. There-in lies Madonna's triumph with 'Like a Prayer'. It still sounds catchy and danceable." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} Casino Royale, Sellers was {{appointed}} a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) {{in honour of}} his career achievements. The day before the investiture at Buckingham Palace, Sellers and Ekland argued, with Ekland <b>scratching</b> <b>his</b> face in the process; Sellers had a make-up artist cover the marks. Ekland later reported that although the couple argued, Sellers never hit her. During his next film, The Bobo, which again co-starred Ekland, the couple's marital problems worsened. Three weeks into production in Italy, Sellers told director Robert Parrish to fire his wife, saying [...] "I'm not coming back after lunch if that bitch is on the set". Ekland later stated that the marriage was [...] "an atrocious sham" [...] at this stage. In the midst of filming The Bobo, Sellers's mother had a heart attack; Parrish asked Sellers {{if he wanted to}} visit her in hospital, but Sellers remained on set. She died within days, without Sellers having seen her. He was deeply affected by her death and remorseful at not having returned to London to see her. Ekland served him with divorce papers shortly afterwards. The divorce was finalised on 18 December 1968, and Sellers's friend Spike Milligan sent Ekland a congratulatory telegram. Upon its release in September 1967, The Bobo was poorly received.|$|E
2500|$|After the race, Ruby Walsh said: [...] "I {{was fairly}} adamant that the run at Cheltenham would improve him jumping-wise and {{that proved to}} be as he jumped like a buck today. I think Willie is keen to go jumping fences with him but he's in the mix now [...] - it will have Willie <b>scratching</b> <b>his</b> head". Willie Mullins {{confirmed}} later that day: [...] "he´ll stay hurdling next season. He´s a keen horse and likes {{to get on with the}} job so he could well stay at this trip."

2500|$|Brando {{displayed}} his apathy for {{the production}} by demonstrating some shocking onstage manners. He [...] "tried {{everything in the world}} to ruin it for her," [...] Bankhead's stage manager claimed. [...] "He nearly drove her crazy: <b>scratching</b> <b>his</b> crotch, picking his nose, doing anything." [...] After several weeks on the road, they reached Boston, by which time Bankhead was ready to dismiss him. This proved {{to be one of the}} greatest blessings of his career, as it freed him up to play the role of Stanley Kowalski in Tennessee Williams's 1947 play A Streetcar Named Desire, directed by Elia Kazan. Bankhead had recommended him to Williams for the role of Stanley, thinking he was perfect for the part.|$|E
2500|$|The Godfather {{was first}} {{announced}} by Electronic Arts on March 10, 2004. Speaking at the Bear Stearns Media, Entertainment & Information Conference in Palm Beach, Florida, EA's CFO Warren Jensen confirmed rumors that EA {{were working on}} a Godfather game. No other details were revealed {{except for the fact}} that it would [...] "likely be an M-rated game," [...] making it EA's first ever M-rated title. The game was first shown at the 2004 Spike Video Game Awards on December 14. Slated for a third quarter release in 2005 on as yet unspecified current generation systems, EA showed a pre-rendered cutscene depicting Vito Corleone drinking wine, <b>scratching</b> <b>his</b> cheek, and then looking into the camera and saying [...] "Some day, and that day may never come, I may call upon you to do a service for me. But until that day, accept this, as a gift." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 28 April 1819, a British officer named John K Smith, of the 28th Cavalry, while hunting tiger, [...] "discovered" [...] the {{entrance}} to Cave No. 10 when a local shepherd boy guided him to the location and the door. The caves were well known by locals already. Captain Smith went to a nearby village and asked the villagers {{to come to the}} site with axes, spears, torches and drums, to cut down the tangled jungle growth that made entering the cave difficult. He then vandalised the wall by <b>scratching</b> <b>his</b> name and the date over the painting of a bodhisattva. Since he stood on a five-foot high pile of rubble collected over the years, the inscription is well above the eye-level gaze of an adult today.

2500|$|Time have listed her {{in their}} list of 100 most {{influential}} people twice. Christopher John Farley wrote [...] "Her musicianship raises her above her peers.

Alicia became an avatar for millions of people, always remaining true to herself" [...] in 2017. Rolling Stone considers Songs In A Minor {{to be in their}} [...] "100 Greatest Albums", and its single [...] "Fallin'" [...] in their [...] "100 greatest songs" [...] of the 2000s decade.|$|E
2500|$|On 25 January 2011, {{during the}} 2011 AFC Asian Cup semi-final match between Japan and South Korea, Ki scored the opening goal through a penalty kick. Ki created a {{controversy}} by celebrating his goal {{by making a}} monkey face and <b>scratching</b> <b>his</b> cheek {{in front of a}} pitch-side camera in an allegedly racist slur at [...] Japanese people. Ki initially defended his goal celebration through a Twitter post claiming he was annoyed at having seen a Rising Sun Flag in the stadium. In fact, however, there were no Rising Sun Flags anywhere in the audience seats. Ki then claimed the celebration was a reference to alleged racist abuse he had received during SPL matches from opposition fans, but the chief executive of Show Racism the Red Card expressed scepticism about this. Asian Cup tournament director Tokuaki Suzuki said no action would be taken on part of the AFC and that FIFA has not contacted the AFC regarding the matter.|$|E
2500|$|... {{posted a}} lifted still from a video {{to the social}} {{networking}} website Facebook showing the school's chancellor, Pat Robertson, [...] <b>scratching</b> <b>his</b> forehead with his middle finger. The still gave the appearance that Robertson was making an obscene gesture. Key also criticized Robertson for urging the assassination of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. School officials asked Key to remove the still, publicly apologize and withhold public comment or, alternatively, defend the posting. While Key did remove the photograph, he refused to apologize and submitted his defense on the grounds it was protected speech. Regent rejected his argument and Key was subsequently suspended and later removed. In November 2007, Key {{filed a lawsuit against}} Regent claiming fraud, violation of his right to free expression as governed by rules tied to federal funding, and defamation. Robertson said that, in general, freedom of speech does not encompass the use of these kinds of images. The university stated that Key violated the school's standards of conduct. However, Key's attorney countered with examples of racist images posted on Facebook by other Regent students about which the school took no action.|$|E
