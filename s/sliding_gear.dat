50|$|The {{original}} Hondamatic, {{like all}} following Honda automatics, featured <b>sliding</b> <b>gears</b> on parallel axes rather than planetary gears {{like most other}} automatic transmissions. The design preserved engine braking by eliminating a sprag {{between the first and}} second gears. Shifting between 1st and 2nd gears was done by simply <b>sliding</b> the <b>gear</b> selector from 1 to 2. It did not automatically shift, but because of the torque converter, could be driven entirely in 2nd gear. The Honda torque converter had a lockup, leading the company to sell the original Hondamatic (which had just two forward gear ratios) as a three-speed. The true three-speed H3 was launched in 1979.|$|R

50|$|Automatic {{transmission}} {{families are}} usually based on Ravigneaux, Lepelletier, or Simpson planetary gearsets. Each uses some arrangement {{of one or}} two central sun gears, and a ring gear, with differing arrangements of planet gears that surround the sun and mesh with the ring. An exception to this is the Hondamatic line from Honda, which uses <b>sliding</b> <b>gears</b> on parallel axes like a manual transmission without any planetary gearsets. Although the Honda is quite different from all other automatics, it is also quite different from an automated manual transmission (AMT).|$|R

2500|$|... "The Time Ball {{consists}} of a cast iron cylinder, piston, rack and pinion lifting mechanism, safety lock, electric motor and ball. The cylinder is 30cm diameter and 3 m long. Approximately 7 litres of soapy water fills {{the bottom of the}} cylinder to act as a buffer for the piston. The piston is a 10cm thick block of rubber with a bleeder valve to adjust the rate of descent. The rack extends from the piston to the Time Ball and is 7.5 meters long. A pinion engages into the rack by a <b>slide</b> <b>gear,</b> which enables the electric motor to raise the rack. A large hand wheel is also attached with a pawl gear to prevent back-slipping. The Time Ball is attached {{to the top of the}} rack and is raised 2.7 metres.|$|R

50|$|In {{the typical}} manual gearbox for a RWD car, the driving shaft (input) is in-line with the driven shaft (output), but not {{permanently}} connected to it. A reduction gear on the driving shaft drives the layshaft. In car transmissions, the term countershaft is also used. A {{number of gears}} on the layshaft may then be connected, one at a time, to the driven shaft. Selecting each of these gears in turn gives the various ratios of the gearbox. All of these gear ratios are reduction gears, the engine speed being higher than the input speed to the final drive of the rear axle. Early gearboxes used <b>sliding</b> <b>gears</b> to engage and disengage the drive. These were difficult to operate and also wore on the main working surfaces of the gears. An early improvement was to use separate dog clutches instead to engage gears, leaving the gears themselves in 'constant mesh'. A later, and more gradual development, was the introduction of synchromesh. This is an all-metal friction clutch {{in addition to the}} positive dog clutch, that gradually engages the gears and matches their speed before the dog clutch engages.|$|R

The relative <b>slide</b> between <b>gears</b> is reduced, and the working life of {{the structure}} is increased greatly...|$|R
