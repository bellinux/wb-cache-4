50|$|Polyethylene {{sleeving}} {{does have}} limitations. In European practice, {{its use in}} the absence of additional zinc and epoxy protective coatings is discouraged where natural soil resistivity is below 750 ohm/cm. Where resistivity is below 1500 ohm/cm and where the pipe is installed at or below the water table, where there are additional artificial soil contaminants and particularly stray currents again it is recommended for use in addition to zinc and epoxy coating. Because of the vulnerability of polyethylene to UV degradation, sleeving, or <b>sleeved</b> <b>pipe</b> should not be stored in sunlight, although carbon pigments included in the sleeving can provide some limited protection.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{inclined}} eight-story {{reinforced concrete}} {{building on a}} thick soft clay deposit was leveled by compensation grouting with short gel time grout injected through <b>sleeved</b> <b>pipes.</b> The monitoring system is used to record the injected grout volume, the mat foundation’s heaved volume after grouting, and the mat foundation’s settled volume during pore pressure dissipation. The grouting efficiencies improved from negative value to less than 1, and the stress histories of clay soils changed from normally consolidated to over-consolidated. A final compensation efficiency of 9. 78 % was achieved and the building was successfully leveled...|$|R

40|$|French drains or infiltrating filter drains are {{commonly}} fitted with slotted plastic pipe {{to act as}} an overflow mechanism when rainfall is too great to allow complete infiltration. The release of the effluent from such pipes is commonly to surface water courses. Whilst there is expected to be some slight degree of protection against hydrocarbon release because of interaction with the drain’s stone infill material this will be severely limited. This paper reports an experiment in which model filter drains with or without geotextile sleeves around the slotted drain are challenged with lubricating oil. The textile was a surface-treated non-woven geotextile manufactured from polyester. The models were challenged with very high loadings of oil, as would be anticipated in a motor vehicle collision occurring close to the drain. A series of simulated 10 - 20 mm rain events over 1 hour were applied and two sample types were collected which either included or excluded any free product. Additional aliquots of oil were added at each rain event. The un-sleeved models were found to release visible free product with the addition of as little as 100 ml of oil per linear meter of drain. For the models with geotextile sleeves there was no such release with as much as 2000 ml per linear metre. Analysis showed that under these conditions the geotextile <b>sleeved</b> <b>pipes</b> continued to produce effluent with hydrocarbon concentrations well below the 5000 g/l limit usually accepted in the UK...|$|R
40|$|International audienceGrouting is {{generally}} used for ground reinforcement orfor reducing soil permeability. However, choosinggrouting parameters or predicting improvements is atpresent rather empirical. A numerical approach maytherefore enable grouting {{to be more}} efficient. Thepurpose {{of this paper is}} to model the evolution, in timeand space, of two major variables: grout concentrationand fluid pressure in grouted soil. After a briefdescription of a first tried diffusive model, this studyaims to describe the performance of a softwareprogram, Athos. This program was initially developedfor the oil industry and uses a piston model. Results aregiven in one- and three-dimensional approaches. Theyunderline a rapid evolution of concentration from grout-saturated zones to non-saturated zones. The evolution ofpressure depending on this degree of saturation is alsohighlighted. The second part of the paper compares thenumerical model with a series of experiments carriedout on grouted sand columns and in saturated sandtanks. In the latter tests, the grout is injected into thesand using a <b>sleeved</b> grout <b>pipe,</b> and the progress ofgrout propagation in the soil is monitored by acousticemission (AE). This comparison shows the validity of thechosen model. The permeation distance detected by AEis compared with that predicted by simple groutpropagation models...|$|R
