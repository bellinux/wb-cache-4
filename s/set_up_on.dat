A transmitter was <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> Sljeme in the Tomislavov Dom Hotel {{and during the}} evening of 15 May 1956, Austrian and Italian channels were transmitted (including Rai 1).

5|$|After the Attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the Screen Writers Guild <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> December 8, 1941, the Hollywood Writers Mobilization, a body to {{organize}} writers {{for the war}} effort. Rossen served as the body's chairman until 1944 and advocated {{the opening of a}} Second Front to support West European resistance against the Nazis. His earnings were much greater than in 1937. However, his work for Hollywood Writers Mobilization and for the Communist Party forced him to abandon some partly developed film projects, including The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, which John Huston eventually directed in 1948.|$|E

5|$|After the {{presentation}} {{and discussion of}} the many proposals, a governmental commission was <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> 15 October 1910. It included Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro (painter), João Chagas (journalist), Abel Botelho (writer) and two military leaders of 1910: Ladislau Pereira and Afonso Palla. This commission ultimately chose the red-and-green of the Portuguese Republican Party, delivering an explanation based on patriotic reasons, which disguised the political significance behind the choice, as these had been the colours present on the banners of the rebellious during the republican insurrection of 31 January 1891, in Porto, and during the monarchy-overthrowing revolution, in Lisbon.|$|E
5|$|Alates are {{collected}} when {{the rainy season}} begins. During a nuptial flight, they are typically seen around lights {{to which they are}} attracted, and so nets are <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> lamps and captured alates are later collected. The wings are removed through a technique that is similar to winnowing. The best result comes when they are lightly roasted on a hot plate or fried until crisp. Oil is not required as their bodies usually contain sufficient amounts of oil. Termites are typically eaten when livestock is lean and tribal crops have not yet developed or produced any food, or if food stocks from a previous growing season are limited.|$|E

5|$|For the show, Minogue {{collaborated with}} {{creative}} director William Baker and art director Alan MacDonald. Baker and MacDonald had previously {{worked with the}} singer on her KylieFever2002 tour. The musical arrangements were handled by Steve Anderson, while the dance routines were choreographed by Michael Rooney. Display hardware manufacturer Barco was hired to provide 100 square metres large LED displays, which were <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the stage behind Minogue. They were used to show animations and high resolution graphics. Minogue wore five different costumes during the 75-minute-long show. Fashion houses like Balenciaga, Chanel, and Helmut Lang designed these costumes. Minogue was backed by 12 dancers and a full-piece band. The seating capacity of the show was restricted to 4000 spectators and the entire staging of the show cost £1 million.|$|E

Harrison, Pitt, and Eugene Goossens joined him as assistant conductors. In 1916 Harrison joined the Royal Flying Corps and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the technical branch. He was based in London, and was frequently able to conduct for Beecham, often wearing his uniform.|$|E

Other areas that are suitable for solar cells are lands that are not being used for businesses where solar plants can be established.|$|E
5|$|In the 2008 state budget, the {{government}} {{announced that it would}} extend the tram line further. The first extension, completed in early 2010, was from the existing North Terrace terminus to the Adelaide Entertainment Centre in the inner north-west suburb of Hindmarsh, with a park and ride service <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> Port Road. Following the expected electrification of the Outer Harbour and Grange rail lines, new tram-trains were proposed to run to West Lakes, Port Adelaide and Semaphore by 2018. However, these plans were later scrapped in the 2012 state budget.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the storm, a special mobile force was {{dispatched}} by officials to assist in relief operations. Red Cross distribution centers were <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> Mauritius and served food and clothing to more than 500 by January 25. Despite the severity of damage, government officials declined to appeal for international aid. Although no requests for aid were made, the Government of Norway provided US$10,000 worth of funds to the nation. Owing to the effects of Cyclone Dina and several other meteorological factors, the economy of Mauritius suffered significantly in 2002 as a whole. Annual growth dropped to about 1.9 percent from approximately 5 percent in 2001. The sugarcane industry suffered greatly from the storm, experiencing a 19.3 percent decrease.|$|E

5|$|Michel Roux is {{the brother}} of Albert Roux. Michel has a son named Alain Roux, while Albert's son is Michel Roux, Jr.. When Alain was ten years old, Michel and his wife divorced, with his wife taking British born Alain and his two sisters to France. Alain would visit during the school {{holidays}} and work with Michel in the kitchens and decided {{at the age of}} fourteen that he wanted to become a chef like his father. Michel met his second wife, Robyn Joyce, after being <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> a blind date with her by former apprentice Leigh Stone-Herbert in Sydney, Australia.

5|$|The {{opening of}} Dinner was {{announced}} in August 2010, to open in early 2011 to replace the Michelin starred restaurant Foliage at the Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park.

The decision was made to push back the opening until after the Christmas period was over. Reservations began to be accepted on 1 December 2010 for the restaurant's opening on 31 January 2011. There were 42 phone lines <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the opening day of reservations, which received over 600 telephone bookings. Prior to opening, the first three months were solidly booked. A Valentine's day booking was sold on auction site eBay, which went for £250.|$|E
5|$|The {{two sides}} commemorated their dead in very {{different}} ways. Various mostly unofficial memorials were <b>set</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the western side by people seeking to commemorate victims of the border.

The death of East German Heinz-Josef Große in 1982 was commemorated annually by demonstrations on the Western side of the border. After the policy of détente was initiated in the 1970s, this became politically inconvenient and state support for border memorials largely ceased.|$|E
