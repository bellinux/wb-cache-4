Some controllers thought the retrorocket pack should be jettisoned after retrofire, while other controllers thought the retro pack should be retained, as added assurance that the heat shield would stay in place. Flight Director Chris Kraft and Mission Director Walter C. Williams, decided to keep the retro pack in place during reentry. Walter Schirra, the California communicator at Point Arguello, relayed the instructions to Glenn: the retro pack should be retained until the spacecraft was over the Texas tracking station. After the mission was over, the [...] "Segment 51" [...] warning light problem was later determined to be a faulty <b>sensor</b> <b>switch,</b> meaning that the heat shield and landing bag were in fact secure during reentry.|$|E

40|$|Many {{plant disease}} {{resistance}} (R) proteins {{belong to the}} family of nucleotide-binding-leucine rich repeat (NB-LRR) proteins. NB-LRRs mediate recognition of pathogen-derived effector molecules and subsequently activate host defence. Their multi-domain structure allows these pathogen detectors to simultaneously act as <b>sensor,</b> <b>switch</b> and response factor. Structure–function analyses and the recent elucidation of the 3 D structures of subdomains have provided new insight in how these different functions are combined and what the contribution is of the individual subdomains. Besides interdomain contacts, interactions with chaperones, the proteasome and effector baits are required to keep NB-LRRs in a signalling-competent, yet auto-inhibited state. In this review we explore operational models of NB-LRR functioning based on recent advances in understanding their structur...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple hysteretic method {{to obtain the}} energy required to operate the gate-drive, sensors, and other circuits within nonneutral ac switches intended for use in load automated buildings. The proposed method features a switch-mode low part-count self-powered MOSFET ac switch that achieves efficiency and load current THD figures {{comparable to those of}} an externally gate-driven switch built using similar MOSFETS. The fundamental operation of the method is explained in detail, followed by the modifications required for practical implementation. Certain design rules that allow the method to accommodate a wide range of single-phase loads from 10 VA to 1 kVA are discussed, along with an efficiency enhancement feature based on inherent MOSFET characteristics. The limitations and side effects of the method are also mentioned according to their levels of severity. Finally, experimental results obtained using a prototype <b>sensor</b> <b>switch</b> are presented, along with a performance comparison of the prototype with an externally gate-driven MOSFET switch...|$|E
40|$|Abstract One of {{the most}} serious {{concerns}} for wireless sensor networks (WSN) is energy. To obtain long lifetime, one potential method is deploying redundant sensors in the WSN and let each <b>sensor</b> <b>switch</b> its state between ACTIVE and OFF. At the same time, the WSN should meet various requirements of quality of service (QoS). This paper focuses on two important measurements of OoS: sensing coverage and network connectivity. Existing researches have provided many algorithms to schedule the nodes ’ states for coverage preserving, including location-free ones. Our work differs from existing location-free algorithms in several key ways: (1). We propose a novel principle on coverage preserving that is suitable for location-free schemes; (2). Following the principle, a distributed, localized and location-free node scheduling algorithm, Stand Guard Algorithm (StanGA), is proposed for treating coverage and connectivity in a unified scheme. Under certain conditions, StanGA can guarantee network connectivity and any degree of sensing coverage. Simulation results show that StanGA is scalable and robust, and also show that StanGA outperforms existing location-free algorithms even when only coverage issue is considered...|$|E

40|$|International audienceArchitectural {{optimization}} for heterogeneous multi-sensor processing {{is a real}} technological challenge. Most of {{the vision}} systems involve only one single color sensor {{and they do not}} address the heterogeneous sensors challenge. However, more and more applications require other types of sensor in addition, such as infrared or low-light sensor, so that the vision system could face various luminosity conditions. These heterogeneous sensors could differ in the spectral band, the resolution or even the frame rate. Such sensor variety needs huge computing performance, but embedded systems have stringent area and power constraints. Reconfigurable architecture makes possible flexible computing while respecting the latter constraints. Many reconfigurable architectures for vision application have been proposed in the past. Yet, few of them propose a real dynamic adaptation capability to manage sensor heterogeneity. In this paper, a self-adaptive architecture is proposed to deal with heterogeneous sensors dynamically. This architecture supports on-the-fly <b>sensor</b> <b>switch.</b> Architecture of the system is self-adapted thanks to a system monitor and an adaptation controller. A stream header concept is used to convey sensor information to the self-adaptive architecture. The proposed architecture was implemented in Altera Cyclone V FPGA. In this implementation, adaptation of the architecture consists in Dynamic and Partial Reconfiguration of FPGA. The self-adaptive ability of the architecture has been proved with low resource overhead and an average global adaptation time of 75 ms...|$|E
40|$|Fibroblast {{growth factor}} receptors (FGFRs) are {{involved}} in proliferative and differentiation physiological responses. Deregulation of FGFR-mediated signaling involving the Ras/PI 3 K/Akt and the Ras/Raf/ERK MAPK pathways is causally involved {{in the development of}} several cancers. The caspase- 3 /p 120 RasGAP module is a stress <b>sensor</b> <b>switch.</b> Under mild stress conditions, RasGAP is cleaved by caspase- 3 at position 455. The resulting N-terminal fragment, called fragment N, stimulates anti-death signaling. When caspase- 3 activity further increases, fragment N is cleaved at position 157. This generates a fragment, called N 2, that no longer protects cells. Here, we investigated in Xenopus oocytes the impact of RasGAP and its fragments on FGF 1 -mediated signaling during G 2 /M cell cycle transition. RasGAP used its N-terminal Src homology 2 domain to bind FGFR once stimulated by FGF 1, and this was necessary for the recruitment of Akt to the FGFR complex. Fragment N, which did not associate with the FGFR complex, favored FGF 1 -induced ERK stimulation, leading to accelerated G 2 /M transition. In contrast, fragment N 2 bound the FGFR, and this inhibited mTORC 2 -dependent Akt Ser- 473 phosphorylation and ERK 2 phosphorylation but not phosphorylation of Akt on Thr- 308. This also blocked cell cycle progression. Inhibition of Akt Ser- 473 phosphorylation and entry into G 2 /M was relieved by PHLPP phosphatase inhibition. Hence, full-length RasGAP favors Akt activity by shielding it from deactivating phosphatases. This shielding was abrogated by fragment N 2. These results highlight the role played by RasGAP in FGFR signaling and how graded stress intensities, by generating different RasGAP fragments, can positively or negatively impact this signaling...|$|E
40|$|Substrate {{engagement}} by F-box proteins promotes NEDD 8 {{modification of}} cullins, which {{is necessary for}} the activation of cul-lin-RING E 3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs). However, the mechanism by which substrate recruitment triggers cullin neddylation re-mains unclear. Here, we identify DCNL 1 (defective in cullin neddylation 1 -like 1) as a component of CRL 2 called ECV (elongins BC/CUL 2 /VHL) and show that molecular suppression of DCNL 1 attenuates CUL 2 neddylation. DCNL 1 via its DAD patch binds to CUL 2 but is also able to bind VHL independent of CUL 2 and the DAD patch. The engagement of the substrate hypoxia-induc-ible factor 1 (HIF 1) to the substrate receptor VHL increases DCNL 1 binding to VHL as well as to CUL 2. Notably, an engi-neered mutant form of HIF 1 that associates with CUL 2, but not DCNL 1, fails to trigger CUL 2 neddylation and retains ECV in an inactive state. These findings support a model in which substrate engagement prompts DCNL 1 recruitment that facilitates the initiation of CUL 2 neddylation and define DCNL 1 as a “substrate <b>sensor</b> <b>switch</b> ” for ECV activation. Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs), the largest family of E 3 ubiquitinligases, are multiprotein complexes involved in protein deg-radation (1, 2). They are assembled on a cullin scaffold (CUL 1, CUL 2, CUL 3, CUL 4 A, CUL 4 B, and CUL 5) and contain a RING finger protein (RBX 1 or RBX 2) at the cullin C-terminal domain (CTD) as well as a substrate receptor, which generally associates with the cullin N-terminal domain (NTD) via adaptor protein...|$|E
