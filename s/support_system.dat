40|$|One of the {{important}} bottlenecks to the wider adoption of planning <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> {{is a lack of}} evidence about whether they improve planning processes. In addition, existing research does not include field studies with high context validity. This paper fills this gap in the literature by reporting the results from a field study evaluating the performance of a planning <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> used for sketch planning as part of a land use planning project in metropolitan Austin, Texas, USA. Participants reported high levels of learning and dialog quality, the two chosen planning <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> performance measures. A regression analysis finds both are related to the ability of planning <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> to change participantsâ€™ perceptions. In addition, as suggested by learning theory, the planning <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> performance outcomes are significantly related to participantsâ€™ identity as a planner and meeting attendance, but are not related to gender or educational attainment. Finally, for the planning <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> studied here, participation in the planning <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> creation is less important than other factors in explaining planning <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> performance.

Depression is reported among lesbians at a rate similar to heterosexual women, although generalized anxiety disorder is more likely to appear among lesbian and bisexual women than heterosexual women. Depression is a more significant problem among women who feel they must hide their sexual orientation from friends and family, or experience compounded ethnic or religious discrimination, or endure relationship difficulties with no <b>support</b> <b>system.</b> Men's shaping of women's sexuality has proven to have an effect on how lesbians see their own bodies. Studies have shown that heterosexual men and lesbians have different standards for what they consider attractive in women. Lesbians who view themselves with male standards of female beauty may experience lower self-esteem, eating disorders, and higher incidence of depression. More than half the respondents to a 1994 survey of health issues in lesbians reported they had suicidal thoughts, and 18% had attempted suicide.|$|E

Classes range from on-foot units like swordsmen and knights, mounted units such as the series' recurring Pegasus Knights, and magic-wielding units such as Mages. Each class also has its own battle animation. Upon performing an action in battle, characters are awarded by experience points (EXP). Upon gathering enough EXP, the character levels up, and its statistics such as defense and critical strike rate are raised randomly. Using special items, a unit's class can be evolved into an Advanced Class, changing their class and altering their statistics.

Analyzing Zerodur major mirrors with a diameter to thickness ratio less than 7. 3, deformation due to supporting gives an RMS value less than 6 -nm which is 24 % of the design requirement of 60 -nm.

The aim of the website was to improve the utilisation of the existing <b>support</b> <b>systems.</b> This study evaluated the students’ perception of the <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> and whether the website would resolve barriers hindering utilisation of support. METHOD: Focus groups were selected by theoretical sampling in the first and final quarter of the academic year. The sample group consisted of 120 medical students from all years of study. The transcribed tape recordings, field notes, e-mail responses and observations of the focus groups were analysed for themes by open, axial and selective coding. RESULTS: The medical students varied in their awareness of the available <b>support</b> <b>systems.</b> The majority were unaware of procedures to access the <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> and what services were offered by each. There were numerous barriers to utilising the <b>support</b> <b>systems</b> effectively. The barriers included the students’ perception of failure in admitting that they require assistance and the remainder were mostly of an administrative nature.

The website failed to improve utilisation of the extensive existing <b>support</b> <b>systems.</b> The barriers suggest other ways of improving support that include addressing social support, socialisation and life skills training as well as streamlining the marketing of existing <b>support</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
