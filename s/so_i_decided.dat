5|$|In Falls the Shadow (1988) Penman {{chronicles the}} family {{relationships}} of King Henry III and his brother-in-law Simon de Montfort. Falls the Shadow is a bridge novel as Penman uses the Simon de Montfort rebellion to lead {{her to the}} conclusion of the trilogy in The Reckoning. As Penman explains: '“After I’d finished Here Be Dragons, I knew I wanted to continue the story… At first I’d planned to write one book in which Simon de Montfort would share top billing with Llewelyn Fawr’s grandson, Llewelyn ap Gruffydd, who later wed Simon’s daughter. I soon realized, though, that this was too much to tackle in one book, that Simon and Llewelyn each deserved his own novel. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> to devote Falls the Shadow to Simon and The Reckoning to Llewelyn".|$|E

Penman's first mystery, The Queen's Man, was a finalist for an Edgar Award for Best First Mystery from the Mystery Writers of America. Penman explains her reasons for turning to the mystery genre after writing only historical novels: [...] "By the time I'd finished researching and writing When Christ and His Saints Slept, I was in danger of burning out. For {{the first time in nearly}} two decades, my boundless enthusiasm for the Middle Ages had begun to flag. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> I needed a change of pace, and since I am a long-time mystery fan, it occurred to me that a medieval mystery might be fun to write. Once that idea took root, it was probably inevitable that I'd choose to write about Eleanor of Aquitaine, surely one of history's most memorable women." ...|$|E

People in the business believed what they read about me. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> to move away and start again." [...] She believed that the anonymity she faced in America helped her get roles on merit and not due to her public image. She earned the part of Sala, the hench-woman to the villainous Drax (Treat Williams) in the superhero film The Phantom (1996), starring Billy Zane in the titular role. A reviewer for Variety considered Zeta-Jones to be a standout in her part, but the film received a negative critical reception and earned little at the box office.

[...] For the scene after the intro wherein Mulder discovers the charred remains of abductees, the prop and the production design departments had to create specialized fake bodies. Carter later noted that it's [...] "harder than it looks to create a charred, dead body." [...] The stage for the alien abduction scene was built from scratch: construction supervisor Rob Maier was tasked with creating a full-scale replica of the Ruskin Dam bridge in order to ease up the shots.

500|$|The vocals, handled {{jointly by}} Shields and Butcher, are kept {{relatively}} {{low in the}} mix, and {{are for the most}} part highly pitched. On occasion Shields sang the higher register and Butcher the lower one. According to Shields, because the band had spent so long working on the album's vocals, he [...] "couldn't tolerate really clear vocals, where you just hear one voice", thus [...] "it had to be more like a sound." [...] Butcher explained her [...] "dreamy, sensual" [...] style vocals, saying, [...] "Often when we do vocals, it's 7:30 in the morning; I've usually just fallen asleep and have to be woken up to sing." [...] To aid this effect, Shields and Ó Cíosóig even sampled Butcher's voice and reused it as instrumentation.

Åhlund played {{some of his}} old songs for Robyn, and re-wrote [...] "Hang with Me" [...] for her. Originally, the song {{did not have a}} chorus and Robyn noted that Bruna's version [...] "sounded very different" [...] from her own. Robyn's version {{was one of the first}} songs recorded for the Body Talk series, but she decided to save it for a later release to give it a chance of becoming a single. In an interview with Gary Graff of The Macomb Daily, she spoke of covering Bruna's song and altering the lyrics, [...] "It didn’t have a chorus when we started working on it. It had a shorter verse and it was a ballad, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> if I could make Klas [...] turn it into a more uptempo and bring the BPM up, it could work. So we started there and he kept writing the song while we were recording, and it came out great." [...] Robyn felt that she could be [...] "seductive and sweet in a [...] uncompromising way" [...] on the song.|$|E
500|$|Niffenegger is {{an artist}} {{who teaches at the}} Center for Book and Paper Arts at Columbia College Chicago, where she prepares editions of handpainted books. She {{produced}} some of her earlier works in editions of ten copies, which were sold in art galleries. However, she decided that The Time Traveler's Wife {{would have to be a}} novel: [...] "I got the idea for the title, and when I draw I have this big drawing table covered with brown paper, and I write ideas down on the paper. So I wrote down this title and after a while I started to think about it. I couldn't think of a way to make it a picture book because still pictures don't represent time very well, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> to write a novel." [...] She was intrigued by the title because [...] "it immediately defined two people and their relationship to each other". Niffenegger said that its source was an epigraph to J. B. Priestley's 1964 novel Man and Time: [...] "Clock time is our bank manager, tax collector, police inspector; this inner time is our wife." [...] Drawing her central theme from this image, she says, [...] "Henry is not only married to Clare; he's also married to time." [...] Other authors whom Niffenegger has cited as influencing the book include Richard Powers, David Foster Wallace, Henry James, and Dorothy Sayers.|$|E

500|$|The last parody {{recorded}} for {{the album was}} [...] "Lasagna", a parody of the traditional folk song [...] "La Bamba". The song is mainly about Italian culture with a heavy emphasis on cuisine. When Yankovic began writing the song, he originally {{wanted it to be}} sung in Italian. He later said, [...] "I was actually going through Italian phrase books and dictionaries until I realized that the humor would be lost on 99% of the audience, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> to do the whole thing in English but with kind of a bad Italian accent." [...] When the song was released as a single, it did not have a music video. However, ten years later in 1997 a short video was made for The Weird Al Show. Under U.S. law, Yankovic can parody any song he wants as long as he pays royalties to use the original music. However, as a personal rule, he asks for permission anyway in order to maintain good relations with the industry. This particular song is an exception to that rule. Although the song is a parody of the Los Lobos cover version, [...] "Lasagna" [...] marked Yankovic's first parody that did not require either permission from an artist or a payment of royalties, since the song [...] "La Bamba" [...] is a traditional folk song that is not attributed to any specific writer. Thus, Yankovic is the only writer given credit in the liner notes.|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{controversial}} period of her career, Madonna said, [...] "I feel I've been misunderstood.

Sex is such a taboo subject and it's such a distraction that I'd rather not even offer it up." [...] During 1994, Madonna started recording her sixth studio album. She collaborated with R producers such as Dallas Austin, Dave [...] "Jam" [...] Hall, and Babyface, and also enlisting British producer Nellee Hooper to the project. It became one of the very few occasions where she collaborated with well-known producers, the first since Nile Rodgers on Like a Virgin (1984). When asked about the record, Madonna said she wanted people to concentrate on the musical aspects of it, and would like the songs to speak for themselves. She also commented that it was because she was not interested in giving many interviews and being on the cover of magazines. She described the album as [...] "a combination of pop, R, hip-hop and a Madonna record. It's very, very romantic". In an interview with The Face magazine, Madonna explained her inspirations behind Bedtime Stories as well as the reason for teaming up with R song producers.|$|E

30|$|First of all, {{the basic}} mechanism/process of ‘deciding’ to believe or better to ‘arriving’ to believe {{is not a}} true ‘decision’, based on {{advantages}} and convenience; I {{like to believe that}} P <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>decide</b> to believe it. This is in case just a deceptive and unconscious process of ‘motivated reasoning’, or a ‘defensive mechanism’ (Miceli and Castelfranchi 1998). We cannot for example believe that something is true just because X pays us if we believe so, or because X would harm us if we do not believe so. ‘Economic’, rational, convenience doesn’t govern the believing ‘decision’; we can just declare to X and simulate that we believe what he likes. Believing process has its own bases: source credibility, supports, evidences (section “The value of knowledge and its origin”); it is an epistemic process not a utility driven one. And the convenience of a given belief cannot (consciously) alter its ‘credibility’.|$|R
