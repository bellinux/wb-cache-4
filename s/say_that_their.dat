It is true that the {{archbishop}} does not approve of these enchantments and rebukes them for the practice. But this has no effect, because they <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> forefathers did these things of old.|$|E
25|$|Several {{studies have}} been done on Palestinian textbooks. The U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem {{commissioned}} studies from IPCRI – Israel/Palestine Center for Research and Information. In Europe the Georg Eckert Institute performed research. The Hebrew University's Harry S. Truman Research Institute for the Advancement of Peace has also published papers on this issue. A U.S. Senate subcommittee and the Political Committee of the European Parliament have both held hearings about Palestinian textbooks. Israel has used the issue as a cornerstone of its Hasbara campaign against the Palestinian Authority. Palestinians <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> textbooks rightly focus on their own national narrative, which includes the privations of life under occupation.|$|E
25|$|Stephen and Suzanne Roper, {{who live}} only 100 {{yards from the}} park, <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> lives have been made a misery by {{the noise of the}} screams as well as {{fireworks}} displays and music. They launched their legal fight in 2002, but after years of wrangling, their claim for an injunction and damages was thrown out in January 2011. Judge Mr Justice Hickinbottom later overturned that decision, bringing the claim back. This now paves the way for a full court hearing. The Ropers will seek an injunction forcing the park owners to close or relocate some rides and an order forcing them to pay damages for noise suffered from 1998 to the present.|$|E

25|$|Lymon's {{marriage}} to Waters was not legal {{because she was}} still married to her first husband. After the marriage failed, he moved to Los Angeles in the mid-1960s, where he began a romantic relationship with Zola Taylor, {{a member of the}} Platters. Taylor claimed to have married Lymon in Mexico in 1965 although their relationship ended several months later, purportedly because of Lymon's drug habits. Lymon, however, had been known to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> marriage was a publicity stunt, and Taylor could produce no legal documentation of their marriage. In Major Robinson's gossip column of June 6, 1966, Zola said the whole thing was a joke that she went along with at the time (October 1965).|$|E
25|$|Some {{corporate}} sponsors are criticized {{for having a}} conflict of interest. For example, some of the prominent sponsors of these advertisements include businesses that sell the expensive equipment needed to perform screening mammography; {{an increase in the}} number of women seeking mammograms means an increase in their sales, which has led critics to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> sponsorship is not a voluntary act of charity, but an effort to increase sales. The regulated drug and medical device industry uses the color pink, positive images, and other themes of the pink ribbon culture in direct-to-consumer advertising to associate their breast cancer products with the fear, hope, and wholesome goodness of the breast cancer movement. This is particularly evident in advertisements designed to sell screening mammograms.|$|E
500|$|The {{photographs}} {{are not of}} uniformly good quality. Dippie says that some are [...] "...at first glance, seemingly candidates for the discard pile". [...] But {{he goes on to}} <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> true value is in their depiction of everyday Cheyenne life in the reservation period in ways that posed portraits do not. On the other hand, Dippie adds, there are some [...] "that would rival the best efforts of a studio portraitist". He concludes by saying that [...] "nyone interested in Plains Indian history will want to own [...] ".|$|E

500|$|That change, from probabilities to {{probability}} amplitudes, {{complicates the}} mathematics without changing the basic approach. But {{that change is}} still not quite enough because it fails {{to take into account}} the fact that both photons and electrons can be polarized, which is to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> orientations in space and time have to be taken into account. Therefore, P(A to B) actually consists of 16 complex numbers, or probability amplitude arrows. There are also some minor changes to do with the quantity [...] "j", which may have to be rotated by a multiple of 90° for some polarizations, which is only of interest for the detailed bookkeeping.|$|E
500|$|In May 2008, it was {{announced}} that the hotel intended to work directly with Wareing rather than through Gordon Ramsay Holdings, as the lease on Pétrus' location inside the Berkeley Hotel was due to lapse in September 2008. This deal resulted in a public war of words between Wareing and Ramsay, with Wareing opening his restaurant Marcus Wareing at the Berkeley in the space previously occupied by Pétrus, and Ramsay's holding company retaining the rights to the Pétrus name. Wareing described his new venture as being a renaming of Pétrus. Originally it was expected that the name would be transferred to another restaurant already held by the company. A spokesperson for the Michelin Guide stated that Pétrus' Michelin stars would stay with the property, expecting [...] "that things will change very little" [...] when it was reviewed for the 2009 guide. Before Pétrus closed at The Berkeley to be rebranded, all of the potential customers in the reservations book were contacted to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> reservations had been cancelled and to offer them a place at another Ramsay restaurant.|$|E
500|$|Lee Bo (aka Paul Lee, 李波, age 65), was a British {{citizen and}} the husband of Sophie Choi, who is in turn {{one of the three}} {{shareholders}} of Mighty Current. Lee regularly helped out in the bookstore. Lee Bo's wife has written a column for 20 years under the pen name of Syu Fei at Ta Kung Pao – owned by the Liaison Office; Lee worked at Joint Publishing until he started work at the bookstore. Since the disappearances of four of his colleagues, he had been doing anonymous interviews with BBC and various media. After the arrest of Yiu Man-tin and the disappearance of three of his colleagues, Lee went on record to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>their</b> motive was purely economic, and that not setting foot in the mainland was the cost to bear for being in the publishing business. Lee was last seen on 30 December 2015, while delivering books in Chai Wan to a certain unknown client. Choi, who had been expecting Lee home for dinner at around 7.15pm on 30 December, raised the alarm when he failed to return home. Lee had apparently received an order for about ten books from a new customer and had arranged to hand them over in person that night. He descended his building in a lift with at least eight other people at around 6pm, and witnesses saw him being pushed by a group of men into a minivan, which sped away the moment he was securely on board. Choi, Lee Bo's wife, later received a telephone call from him from a Shenzhen number. Uncharacteristically speaking in Mandarin Chinese and apparently with someone whispering over his shoulder, Lee said that {{he had to go to}} the mainland on urgent business and that he would not be back home for some time. He assured her that he was well but assisting with investigations. His wife was told to be discreet. The Immigration Department has no record of Lee having left Hong Kong, and Hong Kong does not have any extradition agreement with the PRC. The fact that his home return permit was left at home led many to fear that he may have somehow been abducted by the mainland public security bureau and renditioned to Shenzhen. His disappearance is the only known disappearance that occurred in Hong Kong territory, and thus sparked even more concern on whether the integrity of [...] "one country, two systems" [...] is being maintained.|$|E

[...] "They appear under Russian pseudonyms, because they are ashamed of their Jewish origins (Trotsky, Zinoviev, others).
