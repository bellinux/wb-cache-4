5|$|The <b>solid-state</b> <b>device</b> {{came into}} its own with the {{invention}} of the transistor in 1947. Common solid-state devices include transistors, microprocessor chips, and RAM. A specialized type of RAM called flash RAM is used in USB flash drives and more recently, solid-state drives to replace mechanically rotating magnetic disc hard disk drives. Solid state devices became prevalent in the 1950s and the 1960s, during the transition from vacuum tubes to semiconductor diodes, transistors, integrated circuit (IC) and the light-emitting diode (LED).|$|E
5|$|They {{designed}} and built the telemetry modules {{in their homes and}} garages but they were only able to sell a few hundred units. Mims had sold a feature article about the new <b>solid-state</b> <b>device,</b> light-emitting diodes, to Popular Electronics (circulation 400,000) that May. With the hope of selling kits to the larger readership; Roberts and Mims designed a device that would transmit voice over a beam of light, the Opticom. The editors accepted the project story and both articles were featured {{on the cover of the}} November 1970 issue. The payment for the articles was $400 but meeting Les Solomon, Popular Electronics technical editor, proved to be significant to both Mims and Roberts future success.|$|E
25|$|Interest in the memristor revived when an {{experimental}} solid state version {{was reported by}} R. Stanley Williams of Hewlett Packard in 2007. The article {{was the first to}} demonstrate that a <b>solid-state</b> <b>device</b> could have the characteristics of a memristor based on the behavior of nanoscale thin films. The device neither uses magnetic flux as the theoretical memristor suggested, nor stores charge as a capacitor does, but instead achieves a resistance dependent on the history of current.|$|E

25|$|Except for diodes, {{additional}} electrodes {{are positioned}} between the cathode and the plate (anode). These electrodes {{are referred to}} as grids as they are not solid electrodes but sparse elements through which electrons can pass {{on their way to the}} plate. The vacuum tube is then known as a triode, tetrode, pentode, etc., depending on the number of grids. A triode has three electrodes: the anode, cathode, and one grid, and so on. The first grid, known as the control grid, (and sometimes other grids) transforms the diode into a voltage-controlled device: the voltage applied to the control grid affects the current between the cathode and the plate. When held negative with respect to the cathode, the control grid creates an electric field which repels electrons emitted by the cathode, thus reducing or even stopping the current between cathode and anode. As long as the control grid is negative relative to the cathode, essentially no current flows into it, yet a change of several volts on the control grid is sufficient to make a large difference in the plate current, possibly changing the output by hundreds of volts (depending on the circuit). The <b>solid-state</b> <b>device</b> which operates most like the pentode tube is the junction field-effect transistor (JFET), although vacuum tubes typically operate at over a hundred volts, unlike most semiconductors in most applications.|$|E
500|$|The first <b>solid-state</b> <b>device</b> was the [...] "cat's-whisker detector" [...] {{first used}} in the 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a {{germanium}} crystal) in order to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid elements and compounds engineered specifically to switch and amplify it. Current flow can be understood in two forms: as negatively charged electrons, and as positively charged electron deficiencies called holes. These charges and holes are {{understood in terms of}} quantum physics. The building material is most often a crystalline semiconductor.|$|E
2500|$|In general, {{ultraviolet}} detectors {{use either}} a <b>solid-state</b> <b>device,</b> {{such as one}} based on silicon carbide or aluminium nitride, or a gas-filled tube as the sensing element. UV detectors that are sensitive to UV {{in any part of}} the spectrum respond to irradiation by sunlight and artificial light. A burning hydrogen flame, for instance, radiates strongly in the 185- to 260-nanometer range and only very weakly in the IR region, whereas a coal fire emits very weakly in the UV band yet very strongly at IR wavelengths; thus, a fire detector that operates using both UV and IR detectors is more reliable than one with a UV detector alone. Virtually all fires emit some radiation in the UVC band, whereas the Sun's radiation at this band is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere. The result is that the UV detector is [...] "solar blind", meaning it will not cause an alarm in response to radiation from the Sun, so it can easily be used both indoors and outdoors.|$|E
50|$|The {{capabilities}} and economy of power electronics system {{are determined by}} the active devices that are available. Their characteristics and limitations are a key element in the design of power electronics systems. Formerly, the mercury arc valve, the high-vacuum and gas-filled diode thermionic rectifiers, and triggered devices such as the thyratron and ignitron were widely used in power electronics. As the ratings of <b>solid-state</b> <b>devices</b> improved in both voltage and current-handling capacity, vacuum devices have been nearly entirely replaced by <b>solid-state</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R
