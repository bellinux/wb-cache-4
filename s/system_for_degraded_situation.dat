40|$|Perchlorate (ClO 42) release {{into the}} {{environment}} has occurred primarily in association with its manufac-ture and use in solid rocket propellant. When released into groundwater, perchlorate can spread over large distances because it is highly soluble in water and adsorbs poorly to soil. Two proven techniques to re-move perchlorate from drinking water are anaerobic biological reactors and ion exchange. In this review, {{we focus on the}} application of microbiological <b>systems</b> <b>for</b> <b>degrading</b> perchlorate. Some bacteria can use perchlorate as an electron acceptor while oxidizing a large range of substrates. Perchlorate-respiring bac-teria (PRB) are widely distributed in the environment, and are enriched at perchlorate-contaminated sites. We review the pathways by which PRB degrade perchlorate, and the different biological treatment pro-cesses that have been developed to remove perchlorate from water sources. We also discuss the effects of alternate electron acceptors in the water, such as oxygen and nitrate, on perchlorate removal. Although many different biological treatment systems using PRB have so far only been proven at the bench scale, all pilot scale tests performed to date with a few of these systems have been successful. The success of these perchlorate bioreactor tests indicates that biological treatment is a suitable method for soil remedi-ation and water treatment of perchlorate-contaminated water.

Generally, Scarabaeid larvae, such as T. dichotomus, eat dead plant matter that has been broken down by fungi, such as Basidiomycota. It is thought that β- 1, 3 -glucan, a constituent polysaccharide in microbes, is abundant in decayed plant matter. Studies of the degradation mechanism of β- 1, 3 -glucan under these circumstances are lacking. In the current study, we sought to clarify the relationship between the capacity to degrade polysaccharides and the food habits of the larvae. The total activities and optimum pH levels of several polysaccharide-degrading enzymes from the larvae were investigated. The foregut, midgut and hindgut of final instar larvae were used. Enzymatic activities were detected against five polysaccharides (soluble starch, β- 1, 4 -xylan, β- 1, 3 -glucan, pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose) and four glycosides (p-nitrophenyl (PNP) -β-N-acetylglucosaminide, PNP-β-mannoside, PNP-β-glucoside and PNP-β-xyloside). Our results indicate that the digestive tract of the larvae is equipped with a full enzymatic <b>system</b> <b>for</b> <b>degrading</b> β- 1, 3 -glucan and β- 1, 4 -xylan to monomers.

Here we investigated the cellulolytic microbiome of the yak rumen by using a combination of metagenome-based and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) -based functional screening approaches. Totally 223 fibrolytic BAC clones were pyrosequenced and 10, 070 ORFs were identified. Among them 150 were annotated as the glycoside hydrolase (GH) genes for fibrolytic proteins, and the majority (69 %) of them were clustered or linked with genes encoding related functions. Among the 35 fibrolytic contigs of > 10 Kb in length, 25 were derived from Bacteroidetes and four from Firmicutes. Coverage analysis indicated that the fibrolytic genes on most Bacteroidetes-contigs were abundantly represented in the metagenomic sequences, and they were frequently linked with genes encoding SusC/SusD-type outer-membrane proteins. GH 5, GH 9, and GH 10 cellulase/hemicellulase genes were predominant, but no GH 48 exocellulase gene was found. Most (85 %) of the cellulase and hemicellulase proteins possessed a signal peptide; only a few carried carbohydrate-binding modules, and no cellulosomal domains were detected. These findings suggest that the SucC/SucD-involving mechanism, instead of one based on cellulosomes or the free-enzyme system, serves a major role in lignocellulose degradation in yak rumen. Genes encoding an endoglucanase of a novel GH 5 subfamily occurred frequently in the metagenome, and the recombinant proteins encoded by the genes displayed moderate Avicelase in addition to endoglucanase activities, suggesting their important contribution to lignocellulose degradation in the exocellulase-scarce rumen...|$|R

Our previous studies have demonstrated the presence of proteasomes in white rot Basidiomycetes and indicated that ubiquitin? proteasome?mediated pathway in Trametes versicolor {{is involved in the}} regulation of laccase, a main ligninolytic enzyme of this fungus, upon nutrient starvation as well as in response to cadmium exposure. Fungal laccases are useful biocatalysts {{in a wide range of}} biotechnological applications. Here, we studied the effects of tunicamycin?induced endoplasmic reticulum stress on laccase activity and the 26 S proteasome? mediated proteolysis in nitrogen?sufficient and nitrogen?deprived cultures of T. versicolor. We found that short?term ER stress (6 h) leads to inhibition of both laccase activity and the 26 S proteasome activity. This effect was more pronounced in the nitrogen?deprived cultures. However, after prolonged ER stress (24 h) laccase activity in tunicamycin?treated cultures recovered to levels comparable to those of untreated cultures. In contrast to what was observed after short?term stress, a 24 ?h tunicamycin treatment resulted in a significant increase in the 26 S proteasome activity detected in mycelia from nitrogen?sufficient and nitrogen? deprived cultures (approximately 1. 5 ?fold and 2 ?fold increase, respectively). Moreover, we found that blocking of proteasome function in T. versicolor subjected to prolonged ER stress resulted in a decrease of laccase activity.

Extensive spectrophotometric and polarographic assays failed to detect classical ring-cleaving dioxygenases in cell homogenates or in extracts from ligninolytic cultures.

40|$|The marine {{bacterium}} Microbulbifer degradans strain 2 - 40 produces {{at least}} 10 enzyme <b>systems</b> <b>for</b> <b>degrading</b> insoluble complex polysaccharides (ICP). The draft {{sequence of the}} 2 - 40 genome allowed a genome-wide analysis of the chitinolytic system of strain 2 - 40. The chitinolytic system includes three secreted chitin depolymerases (ChiA, ChiB, and ChiC), a secreted chitin-binding protein (CbpA), periplasmic chitooligosaccharide-modifying enzymes, putative sugar transporters, and a cluster of genes encoding cytoplasmic proteins involved in N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc) metabolism. Each chitin depolymerase was detected in culture supernatants of chitin-grown strain 2 - 40 and was active against chitin and glycol chitin. The chitin depolymerases also had a specific pattern of activity toward the chitin analogs 4 -methylumbelliferyl-β-d-N,N′-diacetylchitobioside (MUF-diNAG) and 4 -methylumbelliferyl-β-d-N,N′,N"-triacetylchitotrioside (MUF-triNAG). The depolymerases were modular in nature and contained glycosyl hydrolase family 18 domains, chitin-binding domains, and polycystic kidney disease domains. ChiA and ChiB each possessed polyserine linkers of up to 32 consecutive serine residues. In addition, ChiB and CbpA contained glutamic acid-rich domains. At 1, 271 amino acids, ChiB is the largest bacterial chitinase reported to date. A chitodextrinase (CdxA) with activity against chitooligosaccharides (degree of polymerization of 5 to 7) was identified. The activities of two apparent periplasmic (HexA and HexB) N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidases and one cytoplasmic (HexC) N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase were demonstrated. Genes involved in GlcNAc metabolism, {{similar to those of}} the Escherichia coli K- 12 NAG utilization operon, were identified. NagA from strain 2 - 40, a GlcNAc deacetylase, was shown to complement a nagA mutation in E. coli K- 12. Except for the GlcNAc utilization cluster, genes for all other components of the chitinolytic system were dispersed throughout the genome. Further examination of this system may provide additional insight into the mechanisms by which marine bacteria degrade chitin and provide a basis for future research on the ICP-degrading systems of strain 2 - 40...|$|R

The class limits were set assuming population development {{according to a}} logistic model thereby cutting classes off at the 90, 70, 30 and 10 % level relative to the pristine conditions. Although floristic diversity and rare species are good indicators for changes they are not fully monitorable during one season. The change of subtidal depth limits of various seaweed species revealed a consistent trend. Water clarity (Secci-depths) increased during recent years at Helgoland by 1 - 2 m and the flora reacted by species-specific increase of depth limits. Thus, only following a set of species will show the trend reliably. As perennial dense fucoid associations {{are considered to be}} of structural importance at pristine temperate coasts and dense Ulva or ephemeral algal or Mytilus associations may show degradation due to eutrophication, a spatial mapping approach was used to classify these variables. Combination of a digital elevation model with a geo-referenced map and mapped polygons of degraded versus dense Fucus serratus associations, Mytilus and Ulva fields allowed spatial quantification of the variables and comparison with a calculated historical situation. The extent of Ulva and other ephemeral green algae could only be monitored by using spatial data (polygons and grid percentage cover data), but classification is still insecure.

The aim {{of our study}} was to examine how the visual <b>system</b> compensates <b>for</b> <b>degraded</b> inputs in object recognition by looking at the time course of the brain's processing of naturally degraded visual object stimuli. The study used a set of 48 images depicting real world objects (24 animate and 24 inanimate). In experiment 1, we degraded the images by varying the simulated focus, such that each image was equally recognizable. In experiment 2, we presented the intact and out-of-focus images to participants, while their brain activity was recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG). In the scanner, participants were asked to categorize the objects as animate or inanimate as quickly and accurately as possible. We predicted a behavioural reaction time effect and accordingly observed degraded objects were recognized 22 ms slower. Time resolved multivariate pattern analysis was used to decode category (animacy) membership, as well as object identity for all possible pairwise exemplar comparisons as a function of time. In the decoding analysis, we observed lower decoding performance <b>for</b> <b>degraded</b> images overall; and the decoding onset and peak <b>for</b> <b>degraded</b> stimuli were 15 ms slower. We assessed several models to explain the behavioural reaction time difference, including distance-based models, which predict reaction times based on exemplar decodability, as well as time-based models, which use the decoding onset and peak. Our analysis shows that distance based models are better predictors. These findings suggest that the time decodable information emerges is less important for determining reaction time behaviour than the quality of the representation (decodability).

To express these constructs, L 8 myoblast cell lines were transfected with LacSwitch plasmids, which allowed for isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside-dependent expression of the gene of interest. Inhibition of calpain stabilized fodrin, a well characterized calpain substrate. Under conditions of accelerated degradation (serum withdrawal), inhibition of m-calpain reduced protein degradation by 30 %, whereas calpastatin inhibitory domain expression reduced degradation by 63 %. Inhibition of calpain also stabilized nebulin. These observations indicate that calpains play key roles in the disassembly of sarcomeric proteins.

The army had 9,000 cavalry and 6,000 infantry, plus {{artillery}} and many wagons in tabor formations.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The cDNA-mediated Annealing, extension, Selection and Ligation (DASL) assay {{has become}} a {{suitable}} gene expression profiling <b>system</b> <b>for</b> <b>degraded</b> RNA from paraffin-embedded tissue. We examined assay characteristics {{and the performance of}} the DASL 502 -gene Cancer Panel v 1 (1. 5 K) and 24, 526 -gene panel (24 K) platforms at differentiating nine human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 - positive (HER 2 +) and 11 HER 2 -negative (HER 2 -) paraffin-embedded breast tumors. Methods Bland-Altman plots and Spearman correlations evaluated intra/inter-panel agreement of normalized expression values. Unequal-variance t -statistics tested for differences in expression levels between HER 2 + and HER 2 - tumors. Regulatory network analysis was performed using Metacore (GeneGo Inc., St. Joseph, MI). Results Technical replicate correlations ranged between 0. 815 - 0. 956 and 0. 986 - 0. 997 for the 1. 5 K and 24 K panels, respectively. Inter-panel correlations of expression values for the common 498 genes across the two panels ranged between 0. 485 - 0. 573. Inter-panel correlations of expression values of 17 probes with base-pair sequence matches between the 1. 5 K and 24 K panels ranged between 0. 652 - 0. 899. In both panels, erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ERBB 2) was the most differentially expressed gene between the HER 2 + and HER 2 - tumors and seven additional genes had p-values | 0. 5 | in expression between HER 2 + and HER 2 - tumors: topoisomerase II alpha (TOP 2 A), cyclin a 2 (CCNA 2), v-fos fbj murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog (FOS), wingless-type mmtv integration site family, member 5 a (WNT 5 A), growth factor receptor-bound protein 7 (GRB 7), cell division cycle 2 (CDC 2), and baculoviral iap repeat-containing protein 5 (BIRC 5). The top 52 discriminating probes from the 24 K panel are enriched with genes belonging to the regulatory networks centered around v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC), tumor protein p 53 (TP 53), and estrogen receptor α (ESR 1). Network analysis with a two-step extension also showed that the eight discriminating genes common to the 1. 5 K and 24 K panels are functionally linked together through MYC, TP 53, and ESR 1. Conclusions The relative RNA abundance obtained from two highly differing density gene panels are correlated with eight common genes differentiating HER 2 + and HER 2 - breast tumors. Network analyses demonstrated biological consistency between the 1. 5 K and 24 K gene panels. </p...|$|R
