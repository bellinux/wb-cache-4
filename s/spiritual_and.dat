5|$|The House of Lords Act 1999 {{removed the}} {{automatic}} right of hereditary peers {{to a seat}} in the House of Lords. Prior to the passage of this Act, anyone succeeding to a title in the peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, would prove their succession by a writ of summons to Parliament. All peers receiving such writs were enrolled in the Register of Lords <b>Spiritual</b> <b>and</b> Temporal, a document maintained by the Clerk of the Parliaments. As a result of the Act, the Register of Lords <b>Spiritual</b> <b>and</b> Temporal only records the name of life peers and the 92 hereditary peers left in the House of Lords. This meant that the register was incomplete as it excludes most of the other hereditary peers, who {{are not part of the}} House of Lords.|$|E

5|$|Another {{criticism}} {{pertains to}} the shift in training focus {{after the end of}} Ueshiba's seclusion in Iwama from 1942 to the mid-1950s, as he increasingly emphasized the <b>spiritual</b> <b>and</b> philosophical aspects of aikido. As a result, strikes to vital points by tori, entering (irimi) and initiation of techniques by tori, the distinction between omote (front side) and ura (back side) techniques, and the use of weapons, were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice. Some Aikido practitioners feel that lack of training in these areas leads to an overall loss of effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|Catholic {{teaching}} regarding sexuality {{calls for}} a practice of chastity, {{with a focus on}} maintaining the <b>spiritual</b> <b>and</b> bodily integrity of the human person. Marriage is considered the only appropriate context for sexual activity.

A year later, {{during his first}} pilgrimage to Poland, his masses were {{attended}} by {{hundreds of thousands of}} his countrymen. The Pope called for the respecting of national and religious traditions and advocated for freedom and human rights, while denouncing violence. To many Poles, he represented a <b>spiritual</b> <b>and</b> moral force that could be set against brute material forces, he was a bellwether of change, and became an important symbol—and supporter—of changes to come.|$|E

5|$|The {{austerity}} and the passivity of {{the first}} character is, however, contrasted vividly with the passion and activity of the second character. Madonna in this portrayal wears a red voluminous extravagant Spanish style dress, which shows off her décolletage, with a middle parting in the skirt, while wearing red carnations in her hair. Complementing this passionate look, the second setting features a bright red room with red candles and candelabra. While the <b>spiritual</b> <b>and</b> pious Madonna shyly watches the Latinos and prays silently in her room, the passionate Madonna dances and leaves the room to join the dancers in the streets.|$|E
5|$|The most {{prominent}} themes are the anti-war and environmental {{focus of the}} film. Nausicaä, the heroine, believes {{in the value of}} life regardless of its form and through her actions stops a war. Loy and Goodhew state there is no evil portrayed in the film, but the Buddhist roots of evil: greed, ill will and delusion. Fear is what drives the conflicts, the fear of the poisoned forest results in the greed and resentment. Nausicaä, {{in addition to being a}} transformative force, leads people to understand and respect nature which is portrayed as welcoming, <b>spiritual,</b> <b>and</b> restorative for those who enter it peacefully.|$|E
5|$|There are {{potential}} problems when the MSE is applied in a cross-cultural context, when the clinician and patient are from different cultural backgrounds. For example, the patient's culture might have different norms for appearance, behavior and display of emotions. Culturally normative <b>spiritual</b> <b>and</b> religious beliefs {{need to be}} distinguished from delusions and hallucinations - these may seem similar to one who does not understand that they have different roots. Cognitive assessment must also take the patient's language and educational background into account. Clinician's racial bias is another potential confounder.|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the relationship between <b>spiritual</b> intelligence <b>and</b> work satisfaction among both leaders and employees. Most studies in this area have focused on researching the relationship between employees’ <b>spiritual</b> intelligence <b>and</b> work satisfaction, so we also researched the relationship between leaders’ <b>spiritual</b> intelligence <b>and</b> work satisfaction.
