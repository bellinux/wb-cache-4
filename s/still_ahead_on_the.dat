60|$|There is a {{plenty of}} other testimonies in the magazine, but these quoted samples will answer. They show the kind of trade the Science is driving. Now we {{come back to the}} question; Does it kill a patient here and there and now and then? We must concede it. Does it {{compensate}} for this? I am persuaded that it can make a plausible showing in that direction. For instance: when it lays its hands upon a soldier who has suffered thirty years of helpless torture and makes him whole in body and mind, what is the actual sum of that achievement? This, I think: that it has restored to life a subject who had essentially died ten deaths a year for thirty years, and each of them a long and painful one. But for its interference that man would have essentially died thirty times more, in the three years which have since elapsed. There are thousand of young people in the land who are now ready to enter upon a life-long death similar to that man's. Every time the Science captures one of these and secures to him life-long immunity from imagination-manufactured disease, it may plausibly claim that in his person it has saved 300 lives. Meantime it will kill a man every now and then; but no matter, it will <b>still</b> be <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> credit side.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{this changed}} the company's plans, work <b>still</b> went <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> razing of the Arlington Beach {{amusement}} park, construction of three paved new runways <b>on</b> <b>the</b> theme park grounds, a new paved runway <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{site of the}} existing airport, razing of the old hangar and office building, {{construction of a new}} hangar [...] by [...] in size and a new and larger office building. By year's end, however, the airport had changed its plans. [...] It now intended to build two hangars, one [...] by [...] in size and the other [...] by [...] in size. (Paving of the runways was also canceled in favor of oiled earth.) Construction <b>on</b> <b>the</b> new buildings began in January 1930. The hangars were designed by the firm of Lockwood, Green & Co., while the terminal was designed by the architectural firm of Holden, Stott, & Hutchinson. Total cost of the two structures, whose designs were approved by the United States Commission of Fine Arts, was $85,000. Forty-five days later, however, some shareholders in the company sued the Funkhouser, Fahy, and others, arguing that they had reneged on a deal to buy them out and further alleging that they were driving the airport into bankruptcy with their profligate spending. As the suit lingered in the courts, Arlington County commissioners stopped the burning of trash at the landfill next to Hoover Field in mid-1932 (but not the one next to Washington Airport).|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, the advent of {{wireless}} networking technology and the achievements in the miniaturization of electronic devices have set new trends in distributed computing. This ultimately enables a new paradigm for embedding mobile users in intelligent environments that support them in their interactions with their local physical surrounding. This vision is called Ambient Intelligence (AmI). There are <b>still</b> many challenges <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way towards the realization of AmI. One question that {{is central to the}} entire concept is: How can we render AmI systems self-organizing such that they can indeed disappear in our environment without creating a massive administrative problem? In this thesis, we propose a model for a dedicated AmI infrastructure that supports the user in his interaction with his physical environment and with external entities. This infrastructure is called Ad hoc Service Grid (ASG) and provides wireless services in a decentralized and self-organizing fashion. We identify three distinct problems associated with self-organized service provisionin...|$|R

40|$|Cancer {{is caused}} by damage to a cells’ DNA. This damage can be {{as small as a}} change or {{deletion}} of one single DNA base, as big as duplications or deletions of a full chromosome, or more complex such as erroneous reassembly of broken chromosomes. All these events can lead to unbridled cell proliferation and defective cell repair mechanisms: a tumor cell. Because of DNA sequencing, we now know several genes that are frequently affected by DNA damage in cancer, and also know the effect of such events <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cell. This has {{led to the development of}} so called ‘targeted treatments’, treatments that are specifically aimed at the defective gene. By applying these types of treatment, we can fight the tumor more effectively because they block the exact processes that make a specific cell cancerous. Unfortunately, targeted treatment has not been as successful as expected, especially not for patients with metastatic disease. In many cases, patients initially respond really well to treatment, but their tumors become resistant after some time, or a subset of their tumors does respond to therapy while other lesions continue to grow. This is likely due to genetic differences between tumors within a single patient, or even between cells within the same tumor: tumor heterogeneity. As a tumor continues to grow, the DNA damage builds up. At each cell division, the damaged DNA is copied to the new cell, and additional defects can occur on top of that which finally leads to large differences between cells. Obviously, these genetic differences will cause the cells to behave differently as well. In this thesis, we investigate the extent of tumor heterogeneity in patients with advanced metastatic disease, by comprehensively characterizing samples from multiple tumor sites or multiple time points. We combine several techniques to capture the various types of DNA damage, and aim to unravel the effect of <b>the</b> genetic changes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> behavior of the tumor by adding gene expression analysis or therapy response measurements. We also present a technique to extract more information from a single sequencing experiment, which increases the efficiency of routine screening for targetable genetic defects. Our results demonstrate the progress that has been made in the past few years, both <b>on</b> <b>the</b> technical and the clinical front, but also reveal the challenges that <b>still</b> lay <b>ahead</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> path to stop cancer...|$|R
