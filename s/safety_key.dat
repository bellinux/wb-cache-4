50|$|Treadmills {{often use}} a <b>safety</b> <b>key</b> with one end magnetically {{attached}} to the machine and the other end clipped to the user's waist. If the <b>safety</b> <b>key</b> is pulled out, {{such as in the}} event of a fall, the treadmill stops immediately. In other cases, some other treadmills have a more traditional kill switch, often mounted towards the rear of one of the hand railings.|$|E
50|$|Trapped key {{interlocking}} utilizes locks and keys for sequential control {{of equipment and}} machinery to ensure safe operation. Trapped key interlocks are widely used to ensure safe access to potentially live or dangerous plant or equipment in an industrial setting. A safe sequence of operations is enabled through transfer of keys that are either trapped or released in a predetermined order. For example, a key is used to isolate a power source (circuit breaker or supply valve), this key is then released and can then be used to gain access through a gate or door to a high risk area by inserting it into an access lock. The key will then remain trapped until the gate or door is closed. A personnel or <b>safety</b> <b>key</b> can be released from the access lock, this ensures that the gate or door can not be closed and the initial key released until this personnel or <b>safety</b> <b>key</b> is returned. This provides increased operator safety.|$|E

50|$|Treadmill desks are {{equipped}} with safety features to minimize the possibility for injury. A <b>safety</b> <b>key</b> attaches the console to an article of clothing on the user. The key can be pulled at any time to immediately stop the treadmill belt. Many treadmill desks are programmed to pause the belt if the user steps off for more than 20 seconds during a workout. A movement indicator is typically printed on the belt of the treadmill to show belt movement.|$|E
