500|$|In {{an early}} draft of Freddy vs. Jason, {{it was decided}} that one of the villains needed a redeemable factor. Ronald D. Moore, co-writer of the first draft, {{explained}} that Jason was the easiest to make redeemable, because no one had previously ventured into the psychology surrounding the character. Moore saw the character as a [...] "blank slate", and felt he was a character the audience could really root for. Another draft, penned by Mark Protosevich, followed Moore's idea of Jason having a redeemable quality. In the draft, Jason protects a pregnant teenager named Rachel Daniels. Protosevich explained, [...] "It gets into this whole idea of there being two kinds of monsters. Freddy is a figure of actual pure evil and Jason is more like a figure of vengeance who punishes people he feels do not deserve to live. Ultimately, the two of them clash and Jason becomes an honorable monster." [...] Writers Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, who wrote the final draft of the film, disagreed about making Jason a hero, although they drew comparisons between the fact that Freddy was a victimizer and Jason was a victim. They stated, [...] "We did not want to make Jason any less scary. He's still a brutal killer... We never wanted to put them in a situation where Jason is a hero... They're both villains to be equally feared." [...] Brenna O'Brien, co-founder of Fridaythe13thfilms.com, saw the character as having sympathetic qualities. She stated, [...] " [...] was a deformed child who almost drowned and then spent the rest of his childhood growing up alone in the woods. He saw his mother get murdered by a camp counselor in the first Friday the 13th, and <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> exacts his revenge on anyone who returns to Camp Crystal Lake. Teenage fans can identify with that sense of rejection and isolation, which you can't really get from other killers like Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers." ...|$|E

2500|$|Justice Blackmun {{had joined}} the Court in National League of Cities but wrote in {{concurrence}} that he was “not untroubled” by Justice William Rehnquist's majority opinion. [...] Chief Justice Warren E. Burger preferred to assign opinions to the [...] "least persuaded" [...] justice, <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> asked Blackmun to write for the Court. [...] Justice Blackmun’s law clerk, however, convinced Blackmun {{that he could not}} write a workable opinion upholding National League of Cities. [...] On June 11 Justice Blackmun circulated a memo announcing that he was switching his vote.|$|E
2500|$|Reading [...] "I am {{too small}} ( [...] , katonti) {{for all the}} mercies, {{and of all the}} truth, that You have shown to Your servant," [...] Rabbi Abba bar Kahana {{interpreted}} the word , katonti, to mean [...] "I do not deserve them" [...] (the kindnesses that God had shown Jacob), for [...] "I am too small." [...] Rabbi Levi interpreted the word , katonti, to mean that Jacob did indeed deserve those kindnesses, but now [...] "I am too small" [...] (for God had already rewarded the merit that Jacob once had, and thus diminished the favor to which his merit may have entitled him, <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> feared that he might have no right to appeal for God's further assistance).|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} years of Camelot, about 1,000 years before the Present, Merlin is walking through the forest, calling out The Dark One with the Dagger of Kris. As the {{original}} Dark One appears, Merlin tells the gold masked being that he destroyed the only woman he ever loved, <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> will destroy him. However, Merlin fails in his attempt to stab the Dark One, only to drop the knife in shock, saying that he can't do it. The Dark One then picks up the dagger, and holds it to Merlin's neck, with Merlin telling the Dark One that he [...] "misses her." [...] However, the Dark One uses the Dagger to collect a teardrop from Merlin instead, which causes the Dagger to briefly glow purple, and turns him (Merlin) into a tree.|$|E

2500|$|This is {{what the}} third column of the toleta is for. [...] The return angles are {{expressed}} as quarters from the intended course bearing (not the current course bearing). [...] In our example, the mariner intended to go east, but has been sailing southeast-by-east for 100 miles. [...] Given the winds, he decides {{it is best to}} return to the original course by re-orienting the ship east-northeast (ENE, [...] "Greco-Levante"). [...] ENE is two quarter-winds above the intended bearing, East, <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> looks at second row ("quarters = 2") on the table. [...] In the third column, the ritorno, shows the number 26. [...] This represents the required number of miles he must travel on ENE bearing for every 10 miles of alargar. [...] Remember, his alargar (distance from intended course) was 55 miles. [...] So in order to return to his intended course he must travel 5.5 [...] 26 = 143 miles on ENE. [...] In other words, he needs to hold his ENE bearing for 143 miles; once that distance is travelled, he should straighten his ship East, and he will be exactly on the intended course.|$|E
2500|$|Phil's {{behaviour}} {{earned him}} a number of sworn enemies in Albert Square and by 2001 the character {{had become one of}} the soap's nastiest villains. In an interview with The Guardian McFadden commented on his alter ego's descent into villainy [...] "Phil's been had over by a lot of people, <b>so</b> <b>now</b> <b>he</b> feels like he can do it back. It's his history". However the character finally received his comeuppance in one of EastEnders most highly anticipated storylines, dubbed [...] "Who Shot Phil?". Phil was gunned down outside his home in March 2001 in a [...] "Dallas-style" [...] whodunnit mystery. Various key characters were in the frame for the deed and viewers were left guessing for weeks as to which of them was the real culprit. Several outcomes were allegedly filmed and it was reported that only a few TV executives knew the identity of the would-be assassin – even the actors were kept in the dark. A spokesman commented [...] "The cast are only getting their own scripts. They are not being told anyone else's storylines. Not even Phil knows who shot him. It's top secret." [...] Script writers were reportedly given private security after a writer's laptop was stolen in what was believed to be an attempt to gain the identity of the assailant. The storyline captivated the public's imagination leading to thousands of bets being placed at the bookies across the UK – bookmaker William Hill said there was about 50,000 bets on who was responsible.|$|E

This caused David Leigh to tweet: [...] "The #guardian published too many leaks for #Assange 's liking, it seems. <b>So</b> <b>now</b> <b>he's</b> signed up 'exclusively' with #Murdoch's Times.
