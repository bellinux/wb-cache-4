25|$|The Ireland cricket {{team have}} had huge success {{recently}} {{on the international}} level which has boosted {{the popularity of the}} game in the country. They had earned the reputation of a giant killer after upsetting teams like Pakistan and Bangladesh (2007 Cricket World Cup), and England (2011 Cricket World Cup). Their good performances in major international tournaments meant that Cricket Ireland openly started bidding for Test match status to the International Cricket Council. Nevertheless, one of the main stumbling road blocks for Ireland from getting to play the pinnacle of the game was a lack of a first-class cricket infrastructure at home, amongst other things. As early as August 2011, Cricket Ireland announced plans of a domestic first-class tournament. In January 2012, Cricket Ireland announced the ambitious 'Vision 2020' plan which announced the establishment of a first-class structure by 2015 and achievement of Test status by 2020. It also began work on a cricket academy to find talented players across the country and improving grass-roots cricket in the country. For the first time professional contacts, with central, A, B, and C were established. Plans for Test status were established partly to stem the flow of their star cricketers moving away to England in hope of playing Test cricket such as Ed Joyce, Eoin Morgan and Boyd Rankin. According to Richard Holdsworth in an interview with Setanta Sports, CI are pleased with the <b>strategic</b> <b>progress</b> that had been made as of November 2012. In December 2012, Ireland got a $1.5m boost as increased funding from the ICC to establish elite domestic competitions in the country.|$|E

Tool for the evaluation and visualization of the accessibility into public space, using TLS, GIS and GPS Technologies, 1 developed during 2014 and 2015 by the authors and others researchers and technicians in the Centre of Land Policy and Valuations (CPSV) and the Virtual City Modelling Lab (LMVC) of the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC) The main goal of the applied research project was the development of a tool to assess the degree of accessibility and calculate optimal routes in public space, and above all their incorporation into an integral system (tool), with accessibility information, services, and support's content. This tool has been developed in two formats, Web platform and App, and the App can be downloaded in situ and remotely via Web. This has been achieved, by steps, and the first one has been the development of a methodology to facilitate universal access to public space, evaluating and obtaining optimal routes for the users.

40|$|The {{adoption}} of Strategic Performance Measurement Systems (SPMS) allows firms to supplement financial metrics with a diverse mix of nonfinancial performance measures to enable better monitoring of <b>strategic</b> <b>progress</b> and success.

This book examines the extent of SPMS and SBSC usage and disclosure among Australia's Top 100 listed firms. It also explores the sustainability commitment level of firms using the Reactive-Defensive-Accommodative-Proactive model. The aim is to identify the SPMS/SBSC disclosers and to gain meaningful insights from exemplary examples of companies displaying high commitment to sustainability through proactive initiatives...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to examine how Africa can become a socially sustainable society by the year 2030 using a strategic leadership approach with Cameroon as a case study. Using a generic and whole systems view, the study would examine the possibility of a transition from a socially un-sustainable society to sustainable society. The study analyses the current political, economic, social and environmental operations that undermines people’s ability to meet their basic needs. It also highlights some of the strengths and opportunities of the Cameroonian society that can help accelerate this transition. Threats and weaknesses are also identified and corrective measures are proposed. Agriculture and social capacity building amongst others stand out as prominent opportunities which could be use to further <b>strategic</b> <b>progress</b> towards sustainability. The study concludes that, with a well defined vision, it is possible for Cameroon to strategically progress towards a socially sustainable society...|$|E

40|$|The United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{executive}} departments in the nation, providing essential financial and medical assistance to veterans and their families. As the VA continues to evolve and grow it is imperative to understand the department’s current capability constraints and how they arose in order to propose effective methods for addressing current issues and overcoming future policy pitfalls. The most critical issues presently facing the VA concern appalling increases in wait-times and backlogs for services, which have emerged since 9 / 11 and are primarily the result of growing numbers of disabled veterans from the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT). Much of the information and proposals regarding veteran benefits claims and conditions at VA hospitals focuses on current aspects of these issues. This thesis examines the growth of the VA since its inception and evaluates the results of policies over the course of recent decades in order to analyze the causes of current issues and offer several policy recommendations for enhancing <b>strategic</b> <b>progress</b> in resolving those issues...|$|E
40|$|Over 120 {{years ago}} Sir James Burns founded an {{organisation}} that is today, the international business group of Burns Philp and Company Ltd. The Group is widely {{known as a}} leading producer of yeast products and manufacturer of other bakery ingredients. Its ability {{to adapt to the}} ever-changing demands of business is widely recognised. During the late 1980 ’s however, after the group expanded into the herbs and spices industry its financial state deteriorated. Yet, arguably the Group had entered a market that complimented its then existing core-activities. This paper examines circumstances surrounding that venture into herbs and spices. It argues that the Group’s financial predicament, at that time, was exacerbated by the use of conventional accounting procedures. It illustrates that up-to-date market related financial details, in lieu of accounting book constructs, more aptly assist directors, managers, all stakeholders to conduct business and make informed economic decisions. This paper suggests that it is an entity’s current financial state of affairs, with regard to tangible market referents, that enables a firm’s <b>strategic</b> <b>progress</b> and facilitates proactive management; and in turn, assists in the sustainable development of business throughout the world. <br /...|$|E

In {{comparison with the}} predominantly survey and interview based literature on board level strategy behaviour, this study employs a longitudinal complete member researcher, participant observer methodology. Its findings are analysed from an institutional theory perspective and reveal selective championing of strategies by directors, the evaluation of <b>strategic</b> proposals and <b>progress</b> in predominantly financial resource/outcome terms, and directors' attention to navigating strategic initiatives through organizational politics. Also revealed are private sector philosophies imported into the non-profit boardroom, the predominantly ceremonial role of formal strategic plans, and an informally enacted strategic discourse.
