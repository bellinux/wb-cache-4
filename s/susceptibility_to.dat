5|$|Banksia lemanniana {{has been}} shown to have a low to {{moderate}} <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, unlike many Western Australian banksias. A study on cultivated plants in South Australia inoculated with P.cinnamomi and P.citricola found B.lemanniana to have an overall low susceptibility overall to both organisms, although 2-to-3-week-old seedlings appeared more vulnerable than 10-month-old ones.|$|E
5|$|Banksia serrata {{has shown}} a {{variable}} <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> dieback from the pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi, the plants in sandier soils showing more resistance than those in heavier soils.

40|$|The {{effects of}} acid, oxgall, and H 2 O 2 on <b>susceptibilities</b> <b>to</b> {{antibiotics}} and nisin were examined for 13 strains of bifidobacteria. <b>Susceptibilities</b> <b>to</b> ampicillin, cloxacillin, penicillin, vancomycin, kanamycin, neomycin, paramomycin, streptomycin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, tetracycline, and nisin A were assayed by a microdilution broth method. Acid-, oxgall- and H 2 O 2 -stressed variants were produced and assayed. Exposure to a pH of 2. 0 for 60 min reduced <b>susceptibilities</b> <b>to</b> cloxacillin and nisin A but increased <b>susceptibilities</b> <b>to</b> ampicillin, vancomycin, aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, and erythromycin in a strain-dependent manner. Exposure to oxgall (0. 3 %) for 90 min increased <b>susceptibilities</b> <b>to</b> cell wall-directed antibiotics and aminoglycosides but increased resistances to tetracycline and nisin A. Oxidative stress increased the susceptibilities of 70 % of the strains to ampicillin and chloramphenicol, of 50 % of the strains to cloxacillin and tetracycline, and of 40 % of the strains to erythromycin {{but did not}} affect <b>susceptibilities</b> <b>to</b> vancomycin, kanamycin, and nisin A. This study shows that exposure of bifidobacteria to stressful conditions resembling those in the gastrointestinal tract may substantially modify their <b>susceptibilities</b> <b>to</b> antibiotics and may thus affect their probiotic capacities, especially when they are used {{for the management of}} intestinal infections and antibiotic-associated diarrhea...|$|R

40|$|Several {{recent studies}} have shown that {{bacteria}} either grown in vitro as adherent biofilms or recovered from infected prosthetic devices have decreased <b>susceptibilities</b> <b>to</b> antimicrobial killing. To further study the microbial and environmental factors responsible for this decreased antibiotic susceptibility, we developed an in vitro model of surface-adherent Staphylococcus aureus growing on polymethylmethacrylate coverslips coated with pure fibronectin. After exponential growth for 4 h, the population of fibronectin-attached S. aureus remained constant for a further 48 -h period, as evaluated by CFU counts of organisms quantitatively removed from the coverslips. At selected time points, surface-bound organisms were exposed to bactericidal concentrations of either oxacillin, vancomycin, fleroxacin, or gentamicin in short-term (0. 5 to 2 h) or long-term (24 h) killing assays. Whereas at 2 h surface-growing organisms were still optimally killed by all antimicrobial agents, at 4 and 24 h attached bacteria expressed markedly altered <b>susceptibilities</b> <b>to</b> these agents. The decrease in susceptibility was moderate for fleroxacin, more important for oxacillin and vancomycin, and extensive for gentamicin. When surface-attached S. aureus was compared with bacteria grown in a fluid phase, both populations showed a parallel time-dependent decrease in their <b>susceptibilities</b> <b>to</b> either oxacillin, vancomycin, or fleroxacin. In contrast, attached organisms became considerably more resistance to gentamicin than suspended bacteria did. Subpopulations of organisms spontaneously released from coverslips during antibiotic exposure also showed markedly reduced <b>susceptibilities</b> <b>to</b> antimicrobial killing. This simple model of S. aureus colonization of in vitro fibronectin-coated surfaces might represent a useful approach {{to the study of the}} physiological and biochemical changes that underlie the decreased antibiotic susceptibilities of biomaterial-attached organisms...|$|R

5|$|Various woods {{differ in}} their <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> termite attack; the {{differences}} are attributed to such factors as moisture content, hardness, and resin and lignin content.

These preferences may in part have represented conditioned or learned behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Zoo or {{laboratory}} rearing and isolation are important factors leading to increased <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> self-harm in higher mammals, e.g., macaque monkeys.

5|$|All three {{thresher}} shark species were reassessed from Data Deficient to Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2007. The rapid {{collapse of the}} Californian subpopulation (over 50% within three generations) prompted concerns regarding the species' <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> overfishing in other areas, where fishery data is seldom reported and aspects of life history and population structure are little-known. In addition to continued fishing pressure, common threshers are also taken as bycatch in other gear such as bottom trawls and fish traps, and are considered a nuisance by mackerel fishers as they become entangled in the nets.|$|E
5|$|Although B. rufimanus {{does not}} {{directly}} affect faba bean yield, it alters the aesthetic quality of the seeds {{as well as its}} germinative properties and ensuing yield is therefore an issue for human consumption and seed markets. A maximum 3% damage threshold is set for seeds targeting market for human consumption. Damaged seeds (seeds from which adults have emerged) might have lower germination rates with 13% reduced germination observed in the lab, but no difference observed in the field. Yield from infested beans are lower (-45% to -70%) than for healthy ones (Epperlein, 1992). In addition, damaged seeds have increased <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> rust and root diseases.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue is}} the role of {{inherited}} genetic factors in shaping attachments: for example one type of polymorphism of the gene coding for the D2 dopamine receptor has been linked to anxious attachment and another in the gene for the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor with avoidant attachment. This suggests that the influence of maternal care on attachment security is not the same for all children. One theoretical basis for this is that it makes biological sense for children to vary in their <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> rearing influence.|$|E
