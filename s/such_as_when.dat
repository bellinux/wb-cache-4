5|$|The ACLU {{has been}} criticized by liberals, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>when</b> it {{excluded}} Communists from its leadership ranks, when it defended Neo-Nazis, when it declined to defend Paul Robeson, or when it opposed {{the passage of the}} National Labor Relations Act. Conversely, it {{has been criticized}} by conservatives, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>when</b> it argued against official prayer in public schools, or when it opposed the Patriot Act. The ACLU has supported conservative figures such as Rush Limbaugh, George Wallace, Henry Ford, and Oliver North; and it has supported liberal figures such as Dick Gregory, Rockwell Kent, and Dr. Benjamin Spock.|$|E
5|$|Barotrauma, {{an example}} of dysbarism, is {{physical}} damage to body tissues caused by a difference in pressure between a gas space inside, or {{in contact with the}} body, and the surrounding gas or fluid. It typically occurs when the organism is exposed to a large change in ambient pressure, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>when</b> a diver ascends or descends. When diving, the pressure differences which cause the barotrauma are changes in hydrostatic pressure.|$|E
5|$|In the 14th century, {{diplomatic}} contact continued {{between the}} Franks and the Mongols, until the Ilkhanate dissolved in the 1330s, and {{the ravages of}} the Black Death in Europe caused contact with the East to be severed. A few marital alliances between Christian rulers and the Mongols of the Golden Horde continued, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>when</b> the Byzantine emperor Andronicus II gave daughters in marriage to Toqto'a (d. 1312) and later to his successor Uzbek (1312–1341).|$|E

5|$|Reversible pulpitis is {{characterized}} by short-lasting pain triggered by cold and sometimes heat. The symptoms of reversible pulpitis may disappear, either because the noxious stimulus is removed, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>when</b> dental decay is removed and a filling placed, or because new layers of dentin (tertiary dentin) have been produced inside the pulp chamber, insulating against the stimulus. Irreversible pulpitis causes spontaneous or lingering pain in response to cold.|$|E

5|$|Since Darwin's On the Origins of Certain Instincts (quoted above) in 1873, path {{integration}} {{has been}} shown to be important to navigation in animals including ants, rodents and birds. When vision (and hence the use of remembered landmarks) is not available, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>when</b> animals are navigating on a cloudy night, in the open ocean, or in relatively featureless areas such as sandy deserts, path integration must rely on idiothetic cues from within the body.|$|E
5|$|The Briscoe Brothers have a {{somewhat}} checkered history with Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG).

In {{addition to its}} song, the American robin {{has a number of}} calls used for communicating specific information <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>when</b> a ground predator approaches, and when a nest or robin is being directly threatened.

5|$|Calls {{are used}} {{for a variety of}} purposes, {{including}} mate attraction, evaluation of potential mates, bond formation, the claiming and maintenance of territories, the identification of other individuals (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>when</b> parents look for chicks in colonies or when mates reunite at the start of breeding season), and the warning of other birds of potential predators, sometimes with specific information {{about the nature of the}} threat. Some birds also use mechanical sounds for auditory communication. The Coenocorypha snipes of New Zealand drive air through their feathers, woodpeckers drum territorially, and palm cockatoos use tools to drum.|$|E
5|$|Direct {{clitoral}} stimulation involves physical stimulation to {{the external}} anatomy of the clitoris– glans, hood and the external shaft. Stimulation of the labia minora (inner lips), due to its external connection with the glans and hood, may {{have the same effect}} as direct clitoral stimulation. Though these areas may also receive indirect physical stimulation during sexual activity, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>when</b> in friction with the labia majora (outer lips), indirect clitoral stimulation is more commonly attributed to penile-vaginal penetration. Penile-anal penetration may also indirectly stimulate the clitoris, either by the shared sensory nerves (especially the pudendal nerve, which gives off the inferior anal nerves and divides into two terminal branches: the perineal nerve and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris) or by the crura ("legs").|$|E
5|$|Games {{are played}} for entertainment—{{sometimes}} purely for entertainment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well.

The players may have an audience of non-players, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>when</b> people are entertained by watching a chess championship. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who {{is part of their}} audience and who is a player.|$|E

5|$|Hampden Park (often {{referred}} to as Hampden) is a football stadium in the Mount Florida area of Glasgow, Scotland. The -capacity venue serves as the national stadium of football in Scotland. It is the normal home venue of the Scotland national football team and amateur Scottish league club Queen's Park F.C. and regularly hosts the latter stages of the Scottish Cup and Scottish League Cup competitions. It is also used for music concerts and other sporting events, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>when</b> it was reconfigured as a athletics stadium for the 2014 Commonwealth Games.|$|E
5|$|In his Balanced Discourse (Lunheng), {{the philosopher}} Wang Chong (27–100 CE) {{was the first}} in China to {{describe}} the square-pallet chain pump used to lift water (and other substances). Although some models were operated manually by foot pedals, some chain pumps were powered by a horizontal waterwheel which rotated large toothed gears and a horizontal axis beam. Their primary use was for lifting water into irrigation ditches, but chain pumps were also used in public works programs, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>when</b> Zhang Rang (d. 189 CE) had an engineer build several of them to lift water into pipes that provided the capital Luoyang and its palaces with clean water.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} career, after scoring a goal, Del Piero often celebrated by {{running to the}} touchline {{in front of the}} fans with his arms out-stretched, and {{sticking}} out his tongue, in a similar manner to Michael Jordan, also frequently leaping into the air with a raised fist towards the sky, or sliding onto his knees whilst passionately chanting to the crowd. Del Piero also performed a back-flip goal celebration in a 2008 UEFA Champions League match against Zenit, and he also pointed up at the sky after scoring on certain occasions, to dedicate a goal to his late father, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>when</b> he scored against Bari during the 2000–01 season, and Mexico at the 2002 World Cup.|$|E

5|$|Krrish was {{the first}} Indian film to be shot in Singapore under the Singapore Tourism Board's Film-in-Singapore subsidy scheme, and more than 60% of the film was shot there. Shooting was {{accomplished}} on location over a span of two months, from September to November 2005. Locations featured included the Singapore Zoo, the Gateway building, and the Singapore National Library. Another major filming location was Robinson Road, where heavy rains caused production delays. The Singapore police were on location to block roads and protect the filming equipment, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>when</b> the film's action scenes required two 250-foot high industrial cranes. Author Audrey Yue noted that the film shoot benefited Singapore by leading to domestic and Indian film-induced tourism.|$|E
5|$|Multiple Aboriginal {{villages in}} {{frontier}} areas rebelled against the Dutch in the 1650s due to oppression <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>when</b> the Dutch ordered aboriginal women for sex, deer pelts, and rice {{be given to}} them from aborigines in the Taipei basin in Wu-lao-wan village which sparked a rebellion in December 1652 {{at the same time}} as the Chinese rebellion. Two Dutch translators were beheaded by the Wu-lao-wan aborigines and in a subsequent fight 30 aboriginals and another two Dutch people died, after an embargo of salt and iron on Wu-lao-wan the aboriginals were forced to sue for peace in February 1653.|$|E
