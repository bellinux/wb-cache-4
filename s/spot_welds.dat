5|$|Spot welding is {{a popular}} {{resistance}} welding method used to join overlapping metal sheets of up to 3mm thick. Two electrodes are simultaneously used to clamp the metal sheets together and to pass current through the sheets. The advantages of the method include efficient energy use, limited workpiece deformation, high production rates, easy automation, and no required filler materials. Weld strength is significantly lower than with other welding methods, making the process suitable for only certain applications. It is used extensively in the automotive industry—ordinary cars can have several thousand <b>spot</b> <b>welds</b> made by industrial robots. A specialized process, called shot welding, {{can be used to}} spot weld stainless steel.|$|E

If the designers had committed wholeheartedly to either polarity of action or horror, Revelations may have been a headshot, but what we're left with is more like a glancing blow." [...] GameSpot praised the gameplay for its stop-and-shoot action and use of the Genesis scanner, saying that it [...] "nicely complements the resource scavenging that underpins your survival." [...] Game Informer {{felt that the}} weapon customization allows for different playstyles, but also criticized the game's lack of enemy variety in comparison to other games in the series. Jonathan Deesing of G4 praised the exploration of the cruise ship setting, comparing it favorably to Super Metroid. However, he criticized the controls for being frustrating and the AI-controlled companions for being useless. Similarly, IGN remarked that the fact that the player is accompanied by a partner makes the game less scary. The Raid Mode was seen as a valuable addition to the game. Eurogamer stated that the mode [...] "is a great concept for 3DS" [...] and the game [...] "executes it with conviction" [...] due to its unlockable features, challenge, and replayability.|$|E

40|$|Steel {{has been}} the {{material}} of choice for automobile manufacturers. In the recent years material such as aluminium and its alloys are taking over the market because of their light weight. The use of aluminium, in automobile manufacturing can result in overall fuel efficiency. <b>Spot</b> <b>welding</b> aluminium alloys require higher electric power and less welding time as compared to steel. Welding guns that can produce an electric current which is approximately 2 to 3 times higher, as compared to steel are required for <b>spot</b> <b>welding</b> aluminium. An efficient method of <b>spot</b> <b>welding</b> Aluminium alloys with the preheating process has been proposed in this paper.

40|$|Purpose: The welding lobes of AC {{resistance}} <b>spot</b> <b>welding</b> and inverter DC resistance <b>spot</b> <b>welding</b> for the {{magnesium alloy}} sheet AZ 31 were compared and analyzed.

500|$|In {{developing}} the Budd-Michelin railcar, the Budd Company used the formed steel technology {{in which they}} were industry pioneers and solved the most difficult problem in using stainless steel for railcar construction: developing a welding technique that would not compromise the strength and corrosion resistance of the stainless steel. On August 20, 1932, Earl J. Ragsdale, an engineer at the Budd Company, filed a patent application for a [...] "Method and product of electric welding"; on January 16, 1934, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) granted US patent 1,944,106 to the Budd Company. Shotwelding, as Ragsdale termed his method, involved automatic control of the timing of individual <b>spot</b> <b>welds.</b> [...] In spot welding, the two pieces of metal that are to be joined are pressed together with an electrode {{on each side of the}} joint. A very high electric current is passed through the joint and fuses the two pieces of metal together. If a spot weld is heated too long, heat will spread from the weld at a middling temperature that weakens the stainless steel and compromises its corrosion-resistant properties unacceptably; Ragsdale's precisely-timed welds solved the problem. With their patented welding process at the core of stainless steel railcar construction, the cars produced by Budd were a truly unique product.|$|E
