5|$|The {{specialized}} hardware of graphics processing units (GPU) {{is designed}} to accelerate rendering of 3-Dgraphics applications such as video games and can significantly outperform CPUs for some types of calculations. GPUs {{are one of the}} most powerful and rapidly growing computing platforms, and many scientists and researchers are pursuing general-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU). However, GPU hardware is difficult to use for non-graphics tasks and usually requires significant algorithm restructuring and an advanced understanding of the underlying architecture. Such customization is challenging, more so to researchers with limited software development resources. Folding@home uses the open source OpenMM library, which uses a bridge design pattern with two application programming interface (API) levels to interface molecular <b>simulation</b> <b>software</b> to an underlying hardware architecture. With the addition of hardware optimizations, OpenMM-based GPU simulations need no significant modification but achieve performance nearly equal to hand-tuned GPU code, and greatly outperform CPU implementations.|$|E
5|$|To create 2,000 Hun {{soldiers}} {{during the}} Huns' attack sequence, the production team developed crowd <b>simulation</b> <b>software</b> called Attila. This software allows thousands of unique characters to move autonomously. A {{variant of the}} program called Dynasty {{was used in the}} final battle sequence to create a crowd of 3,000 in the Forbidden City. Pixar's photorealistic open API RenderMan was used to render the crowd. Another software developed for this movie was Faux Plane, which was used to add depth to flat two-dimensional painting. Although developed late in production progress, Faux Plane was used in five shots, including the dramatic sequence which features the Great Wall of China, and the final battle sequence when Mulan runs to the Forbidden City. During the scene in which the Chinese are bowing to Mulan, the crowd is a panoramic film of real people bowing. It was edited into the animated foreground of the scene.|$|E
