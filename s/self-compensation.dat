40|$|By {{employing}} first-principle total-energy calculations, {{a systematic}} {{study of the}} dopability of ZnS to be both n- and p-types {{compared with that of}} ZnO is carried out. We find that all the attempted acceptor dopants, group V substituting on the S lattice site and group I and IB on the Zn sites in ZnS, have lower ionization energies than the corresponding ones in ZnO. This can be accounted for by the fact that ZnS has relative higher valence band maximum than ZnO. Native ZnS is weak p-type under S-rich condition, as the abundant acceptor V-Zn has rather large ionization energy. <b>Self-compensations</b> by the formation of interstitial donors in group I and IB-doped p-type ZnS can be avoided when sample is prepared under S-rich condition. In terms of ionization energies, Li-Zn and N-S are the preferred acceptors in ZnS. Native n- type doping of ZnS is limited by the spontaneous formation of intrinsic V-Zn(2 -); high efficient n-type doping with dopants is harder to achieve than in ZnO because of the readiness of forming native compensating centers and higher ionization energy of donors in ZnS.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the <b>self-compensation</b> of the {{intrinsic}} estimation error in back-EMF based rotor position observers for PM synchronous motors.

40|$|Abstract—Threshold voltage VT of a {{transistor}} degrades {{with time}} both {{due to the}} formation of defects at the oxide/Si interface, as well as charge trapping into bulk defects – a phenomenon commonly known as Bias Temperature Instability (BTI). However, we have shown earlier that with appropriate mobility vs. vertical effective electric field characteristics, transistor’s drivability (i. e., drain current) can be made far less sensitive to the NBTI-induced threshold voltage degradation ΔVT, than previously presumed. Higher steepness of the mobility-field characteristics results in an increase in mobility due to interface defects, which can self-compensate the effect of ΔVT on drain current. In this paper, {{for the first time we}} analyze the additional effect of PBTI-induced ΔVT in NMOS transistor parameters and show that mobility at constant gate voltage always increases with PBTI, irrespective of the mobility-field steepness. Therefore, <b>self-compensation</b> for PBTI is even more pronounced compared to NBTI. Next, we demonstrate the consequence of <b>self-compensation</b> via an intuitive analysis in simple digital circuits and show that lifetime of digital ICs increases dramatically once we incorporate the effect of <b>self-compensation</b> by using appropriate sign for mobility variation at constant gate voltage. This might in turn reduce the requirement of different circuit level optimization techniques, currently employed to manage transistor variabilities. Finally, we establish the importance of flatter transfer characteristics for <b>self-compensation,</b> which can be obtained through advanced CMOS technologies.

The FBG rotation angle sensor mainly contains two core sensitivity elements (FBG 1 and FBG 2), triangular cantilever beam, and rotation angle transfer element. In theory, the proposed sensor can achieve temperature <b>self-compensation</b> by complementation of the two core sensitivity elements (FBG 1 and FBG 2), {{and it has a}} boundless angel measurement range with 2 π rad period duo to the function of the rotation angle transfer element.

After experimental data analyses, the measurement precision of the FBG rotation angle sensor prototype is 0.2 ° with excellent linearity, and the temperature sensitivities of FBG 1 and FBG 2 are 10 pm/℃ and 10.1 pm/℃, correspondingly.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} study of electron mobility in heavily Si d-doped GaAs {{in the presence}} of applied hydrostatic pressure. At low temperature the electron-ionized impurity scattering is the most important scattering mechanism. The presence of DX centers in Si-doped GaAs results in spatial correlations of the charged impurities, which increase the electron mobility through the structure factor of the charged-impurity distribution and/or a decrease in the density of the charged dopants. A Monte Carlo approach has been developed to simulate this distribution in two dimensions for the d+/DX 0 and d+/DX- models. In the mobility calculation, both intrasubband and intersubband scatterings are considered with the electron-electron screening within the random-phase approximation. A detailed comparison between experiment and theory shows that theory excluding the correlation effects underestimates the electron mobility systematically. In cooperation with other mechanisms, e. g., <b>self-compensation</b> of Si dopants, in the d layer, both DX-center models can explain the experimental results well.
