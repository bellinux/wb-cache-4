40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to describe the clinical signs observed in PRRS positive herds during a porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) outbreak in Ontario and to determine associations between these clinical signs and herd demographics and PRRS control strategies. All PRRS polymerase chain reaction-(PCR) -positive submissions to a diagnostic laboratory between September 1, 2004 and August 31, 2007 were identified (n = 1864). After meeting eligibility requirements and agreeing to voluntary study participation, producers from 455 of these submissions were surveyed for information on clinical signs observed in their herds, herd demographics, and PRRS control strategies used in their herds {{at the time that the}} PCR-positive samples were taken. Larger herd size was associated with an increased risk of reporting abortion, weakborn piglets, off-feed sows, and <b>sow</b> <b>mortality</b> in sow herds, and with an increased risk of reporting mortality in finishing herds. When disease control strategies were examined, use of a commercial PRRS vaccine in sows and gilts was associated with a decreased risk of reporting weakborn pigs and high pre-weaning mortality, while the use of serum inoculation in breeding animals was associated with an increased risk of reporting off-feed sows and <b>sow</b> <b>mortality.</b> Providing biofeedback of stillborn/mummified piglets, placenta or feces to gilts was associated with an increased risk of reporting respiratory disease and mortality in finishing pigs while all-in/all-out flow in farrowing rooms was associated with an increased risk of reporting <b>sow</b> <b>mortality</b> and weakborn piglets...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Sow {{performance}} {{is a key}} component of the productivity of commercial pig farms. Reproductive failure in the sow is common in pig production.

In absence of specific diseases such as porcine parvovirus, pseudo-rabies, swine fever, leptospirosis and brucellosis, management failures are the most important causes of loss. A syndrome associated with reproductive inefficiency, and post-service vaginal discharge and high <b>sow</b> <b>mortality</b> in a commercial pig farm is described. Pregnancy failures exceeded 20 % and <b>sow</b> <b>mortality</b> exceeded 12 % for two consecutive years. The abnormal post-service vaginal discharge rate was 1. 7 % during the period of investigation. An investigation involving an analysis of farm records, a review of breeding management practices, clinical examinations, laboratory analysis and examination of urogenital organs was conducted. The main contributing factors found were a sub-optimal gilt breeding management, an inadequate culling policy in combination with a sub-optimal culling rate and the presence of cystitis in more than 1 % of the urogenital organs examined. The high <b>sow</b> <b>mortality</b> rate was related to an aged breeding herd. A control programme was recommended based on management changes involving oestrus detection, movement of gilts post-service, hygiene in the service area, boar exposure post-service and urinary acidification. This programme failed to increase the farrowing rate due to incomplete implementation of the recommendations made. The farrowing rate increased to 86. 5 % subsequent to a farm manager change in January 2005, which resulted in complete implementation of the control programme. </p...|$|E

Results were based on a questionnaire addressing farm performance, animal and health management, housing conditions and sanitary problems. The pig farms surveyed had to have at least 15 reproductive sows and post‐weaning piglets. These criteria were fulfilled except for one farm where only fatteners were raised. In each country, farms included in the study represented more than 10 % of the production of the national organic pig production. Results provide a good insight with respect to housing and management systems. Organic farms showed a high diversity of housing and management systems between and within countries and even within a farm. Outdoors systems are predominant for all types of pigs in Italy and Sweden, and for sows in France and Denmark whereas nearly all pigs are kept indoors in Austria and Germany.

The aim of this study was to compare the behavior and performance of sows that killed piglets (CR) to those that did not (NC) inside a farrowing hut within the first 72 h after parturition. A total of 336 sows and their litters were used for comparisons. CR sows had more (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) piglets born/litter and born alive/litter than NC <b>sows.</b> <b>Mortality</b> was higher (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) for CR sows, with most piglet mortality in the first 72 h and there was a trend (P = 0. 06) for CR sows to wean fewer piglets/litter than NC sows (7. 8 ± 0. 20 versus 8. 4 ± 0. 26), respectively. Behaviors were collected by time-lapse video on 20 sows, 10 from each group. Four sow postures: walking, standing, sitting and lying; four sow behaviors: pawing, rooting, nursing interval and nursing duration; and one sow location: out of hut were recorded. NC sows had a longer (P = 0. 03) parturition compared to CR sows.

40|$|In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), pigs {{are raised}} almost {{exclusively}} by smallholders either in periurban areas of major {{cities such as}} Kinshasa or in rural villages. Unfortunately, little information is available regarding pig production in the Western part of the DRC, wherefore a survey was carried out to characterize and compare 319 pig production systems in their management and feeding strategies, along a periurban - rural gradient in Western provinces of the DRC. Pig breeding was {{the main source of}} income (43 %) and half of respondent were active in mixed pig and crop production, mainly vegetable garden. Depending on the location, smallholders owned on average 18 pigs, including four <b>sows.</b> Piglet <b>mortality</b> rate varied from 9. 5 to 21. 8 % while average weaned age ranged between 2. 2 and 2. 8 months. The major causes of mortality reported by the farmers were African swine fever 98 %, Swine erysipelas (60 %), erysipelas trypanosomiasis (31 %), Swine worm infection (17 %), and diarrhoea (12 %). The majority of the pigs were reared in pens without free roaming and fed essentially with locally available by-products and forage plants whose nature varied according with the location of the farm. The pig production systems depended on the local environment; particularly in terms of workforces, herd structure and characteristics, production parameters, pig building materials, selling price and in feed resources. It can be concluded that an improvement of Congolese pig production systems should consider (1) a reduction of inbreeding, (2) an improvement in biosafety to reduce the incidence of African swine fever and the spread of other diseases, and (3) an improvement in feeding practices.

50|$|Part of a {{successful}} start into a piglet's life is the consumption of sufficient colostrum (milk from the sow the first day after birth). Colostrum contains high levels of immunoglobulins, which protect the piglet from harmful diseases in the first weeks of its life. Several studies have looked at supplementing sow diets with MOS {{with the aim of}} improving the health of the sows. A healthy sow produces good quality colostrum and spreads less harmful bacteria in the environment where she gives birth and raises the piglets. Several researchers have reported a significant increase in colostrum production and colostrum quality with MOS. Those changes in colostrum quality and quantity likely explain a reduced pre-weaning mortality and a higher litter size and litter weight at weaning and can thereby help to better protect the piglet from disease, thus improving piglet survival. A recent review of published literature showed that the mortality of young piglets was reduced when MOS was supplemented in the diets of the <b>sow.</b> Keeping the <b>mortality</b> of young piglets to a minimum is important from an economical as well as from an animal welfare point of view.|$|R
40|$|The {{invasive}} {{potential of}} a species {{is related to the}} interaction between genetic and environmental characteristics, as climatic conditions and native vegetation, reflecting the species adaptation to local conditions. An ecologically-adapted alien species can alter diversity and structure of forest ecosystems. This study assessed the invasiveness potential of eight commercially important Eucalyptus species in the germination and early establishment phases in southeastern Brazil. The first experiment evaluated seed germination under controlled temperature and air humidity conditions testing six substrate water potentials. The second experiment was conducted in pots to evaluate seed germination and seedling mortality under rainfed and irrigated regimes. Nine field trials were set up in the third experiment in six locations. In each trial, 80 plots of 1 m 2 were installed with half the plots undisturbed and half where preexisting plants and litter were removed. In the first experiment, Eucalyptus taxa differed significantly in seed germination for substrate water potential ⩾− 0. 6 MPa. No germination was found for any taxa at − 0. 8 MPa substrate water potential. In the second experiment, differences in germination between species and water treatments were observed 21 days after <b>sowing.</b> No <b>mortality</b> was found in the irrigated treatments. No seedling mortality was observed in the rainfed treatments when the relative air humidity was higher than 85 %, even during a dry period of 45 days. By contrast, seedling mortality was observed for all taxa in all the rainfed treatments when relative air humidity fell under 80 %. In the third experiment, germination and seedling establishment of Eucalyptus species was always very low. The non-Eucalyptus species showed differences in germination between trials and soil exposures. Our results showed that soil and air moisture were major drivers of eucalypt germination and initial establishment in controlled conditions. However, under field conditions additional factors such as competition of non-Eucalyptus species and seedlings predation drastically limited eucalypt establishment suggesting low ecological adaptation of Eucalyptus sp. as an invasive species.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to estimate economic values for sow efficiency and meat production traits in the Finnish pork production system including the consideration for subsidies. Economic values were estimated by developing a bio-economic model that describes the Finnish production system. Genetic improvement estimates for meat production traits were also developed in order to evaluate how much genetic gain is reduced due to selection for meat quality. Results showed that the highest economic values, when expressed in genetic standard deviations, were obtained for total number of piglets born (2. 07 per piglet), feed conversion ratio (2. 07 per feed unit per kg), and lean meat percentage (1. 69 per %). Economic values for litter size, piglet <b>mortality,</b> <b>sows</b> length of productive life, and lean meat percentage increased when subsidies were not accounted for in the bio-economic model. Results show further that meat quality should have 15 20 percent weight in the Finnish production trait index in order to prevent its deterioration.

Individual sow records, clinical history, backfat thickness, body weight, heart weight, selenium content in liver, and urea concentration in aqueous humor were obtained for each sow. Results from the groups were compared using Student's t-test. Maximum and minimum outside daily temperatures were obtained for the study period. A stressful or demanding event for the cardiovascular system of sows was identified in 84 % of the cases of cardiac failure: nearly two-thirds of the cases occurred during the peripartum period, and other stressful events included heat, fighting, mating, and transport. More than 40 % of the cardiac failures occurred during the months of July and August. Sows dead of cardiac failure were heavier and fatter than sows dead of other causes. The former group also had a significantly smaller heart weight to body weight ratio; this difference was attributed to a greater body weight since the heart weights were similar in the two groups.

40|$|Irregular pagination: missing pages 5 - 8 (Chapter One) A {{series of}} {{epidemiological}} studies {{was carried out}} to identify methods of improving productivity of New Zealand and Thai pig herds. Disease surveillance at slaughter of 2, 807 finisher pigs from 3 piggeries in the North Island of New Zealand was conducted over a 13 month period. This was used to establish and apply procedures suited to New Zealand conditions, for monitoring the subclinical status of 8 production-limiting diseases and 1 zoonotic disease. Enzootic pneumonia, sarcoptic mange and oesophagogastric ulcer were the most commonly observed lesions. Seasonal patterns were found for enzootic pneumonia, pleurisy and ascariasis lesions. Seasonal effects {{were found to be}} associated in part with temperature variation. The effectiveness of simultaneous administration of commercial Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae vaccines was assessed in 380 pigs from an indoor commercial piggery. These vaccines produced significant improvement of growth rate during the high risk period for clinical pneumonia, and increased slaughter weight. Enzootic pneumonia lesions were significantly reduced by more than 50 %, but pleurisy and pleuropneumonia lesions were not significantly reduced. No evidence of synergy between the vaccines in influencing lesion severity for pleuropneumonia was detected. A longitudinal study of thirty cohort pigs was conducted within the vaccination trial, to describe the epidemiological pattern of subclinical A. pleuropneumoniae infection of healthy pigs. A. pleuropneumoniae was first isolated at 4 weeks of age from one vaccinated pig. The incidence of A. pleuropneumoniae infection reached a maximum of 54 % and 40 % at 11 weeks of age in vaccinated and control pigs. No evidence was found to support the hypothesis that infection with M. hyopneumoniae increases susceptibility to A. pleuropneumoniae infection. Pig production data from 16 Thai and 18 New Zealand pig herds for 1991, and from 14 Thai and 16 New Zealand herds for 1992 were analysed to define opportunities for improving productivity in temperate and tropical environments. In Thailand, potential areas for improving productivity are particularly through increasing total litter size and improved management of breeding procedures. In New Zealand, potential areas for improvement are particularly reduction of stillbirths and pre-weaning mortality, and reduction of <b>sow</b> <b>mortality.</b> A new method of graphical presentation of important productivity parameters was used to clearly demonstrate differences in performance between the two countries. PigFIX, a fertility investigation expert system linked to a computer-based herd recording system, was developed to provide diagnostic guidance on likely causes of fertility problems and offer guidance on possible corrective action. A novel approach was used in developing the method by which PigFIX assessed reproductive performance.

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{total of}} 5502 piglets from 435 sows were {{selected}} for evaluation {{of the effect of}} piglet birthweight and <b>sow</b> parity on <b>mortality</b> rate (MR), growth performance, and carcass traits in pigs. Piglets were distributed into one of eight categories according to their weight (1801 g) and sows were classified according to parity (1 - 5). The maximum MR during lactation (day 0 to day 21) was found in category < 600 g, whereas the lowest was observed in categories ≥ 1401 g. Pigs with greater body weight (BW) at birth were equivalently greater until 59 days of age. Average daily weight gain (ADG) was improved by increasing piglet birthweight between 0 and 21 days as indicated by a linear regression effect. After weaning, this effect was reduced up to 168 days, indicated by a quadratic, as opposed to linear, regression effect. The increase in growth rates corresponded to improved lean meat content and hot carcass weight. Increasing sow parity corresponded to a quadratic improvement of BW and ADG during lactation, but not after weaning. However, the improved pre-weaning performance was concomitant with a linear increase of within-litter BW and ADG variation. No effect of parity was observed on carcass traits. Piglet birthweight and sow parity influence litter postnatal development, mainly during early life. After weaning, these effects are less evident with a minor impact on carcass traits...|$|R

The HOOP sows were fed with individual feed stalls. The sows were artificially inseminated in a confinement breeding barn with slatted floors and were later moved to their assigned gestation housing treatment. Sows {{continued in the}} same gestation housing their entire time at the farm. All first-litter gilts were gestated in individual gestation crates to minimize sow size differential in the groups. There were 35 sows per group in the HOOP barns. Farrowing occurred every 2 weeks on a year-round basis. All sows were fed 4. 5 lb/day and increased to 6 lb/day during the last trimester of gestation.

It is important that organic production systems can fulfil the expectations of each of these stakeholders if organic livestock production is to increase further. This is of particular importance if organic pig and poultry production (other than egg) is to move from the present niche-production to a significant place in the food market, {{as in the case of}} beef and milk. It can be argued that the limited organic pork and poultry production is related to the fact that it is far more difficult for farmers to change the existing production systems for pig and poultry compared to production systems for cattle and other ruminants in a way that gives a harmonious balance between the different aims of organic farming. Conflicts may occur as to the most appropriate rearing practice in considerating the basic aspects of the innate behaviour of animals on one hand, the risk of pollution from the production on the other and, in addition, the aim of producing in sufficient quantities. These possible conflicts are reflected in the compromises made in national or EU regulations on organic farming. In the regulations for organic farming, the aspect of allowing a high degree of natural behaviour of the livestock is, among others, translated in the requirement that livestock, in certain periods of their life or of the year, should be allowed to graze or have access to an outdoor area. The most common outdoor systems for pig and poultry used in intensively managed organic production have some significant drawbacks in relation to environmental impact (risk of N-leaching and ammonia volatilisation), animal welfare (nose-ringed <b>sows),</b> high <b>mortality</b> in poultry and workload and management constraints. From recent experience of such systems, it is argued that there is a need for a radical development of the systems. There is a need for outdoor/free range systems (for the sake of the livestock), which are constructed and managed in such a way that the livestock, at the same time, exert a positive influence on other parts of the farming system. There is evidence that pregnant sows can fulfil their nutritional needs to a large extent by grazing, that co-grazing sows with heifers can diminish the parasite burden of the heifers, and that the pig inclination for rooting can be managed in a way that makes ploughing and other heavy land cultivation more or less superfluous. As regard poultry, there is an indication that quite big flocks can be managed efficiently in a way where the flock act as weeders in other crops or fight pests in orchards. These elements need to be further explored as a basis for future system development...|$|R
40|$|Piglet {{mortality}} is both reducing animal welfare and production yield. A {{large part of}} the piglet {{mortality is}} due to crushings by the sow, as a direct effect of the sows posture changes. Both frequencies, duration and other quality measures of the sow’s posture changes (e. g. pre-lying behavior through communication with piglets) would therefore affect crushings. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate if and how the sow-piglet communication and the sows posture change is affected by different pen types, and if this in turn affects piglet mortality. In this study 24 healthy Landrace × Yorkshire sows were included, 12 from a traditional pen and 12 from the UMB-pen (a prototype design-pen), with parities from 1 - 4 (1. 8 ± 0. 20). The sows where recorded on video from prepartum and until 12 hours postpartum. The video material was analyzed for sow-piglet communication and postural changes. A significant difference in activity level was found between comparing prepartum, farrowing and postpartum, with multiparous sows showing more posture changes. A significant difference in activity level was found between comparing prepartum, farrowing and postpartum, with multiparous sows showing more posture change prepartum than primiparous sows. There were few significant differences between the pens, with only more time spend on standing to lying in the UMB-pen than in the traditional pen. The posture parameter best explaining crushings in the present study was the averages time the sow spent standing. Crushing could also be explained by an increased frequency of sitting. Posture changes was also associated with communication. Primiparous sows communicated more, and more communication were performed in the UMB-pen. Frequency of standing to lying by the sow was positively correlated with sow-initiated communication, again positively correlated with crushings. But, when investigating communication effects on overall mortality, the best parameters to explain that was actually piglet-initiated. Increased communication by the piglets reduces mortality, which could both be due to reduced amount of crushings with increased orientation by the <b>sow,</b> or reduced <b>mortality</b> of other causes, e. g. starvation and hypothermia.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Anatomy and PhysiologyJishu ShiPorcine {{reproductive}} {{and respiratory}} syndrome (PRRS) {{is one of}} the most economically important swine diseases worldwide that leads to severe reproductive failure in <b>sows</b> and high <b>mortality</b> in young pigs. Vaccination is currently the most effective way to control this disease. The protection ability provided by vaccines however is limited due to the large diversity of field PRRSV strains. In chapter 2, we compared immune responses induced by vaccination and/or PRRSV infection by using IngelVac® Modified Live PRRSV vaccine (MLV), its parental strain VR- 2332, and the heterologous KS- 06 strain. Our results showed that MLV provide complete protection to homologous virus and partial protection to heterologous challenge. The protection was associated with the levels of PRRSV neutralizing antibodies at the time of challenge. Besides developing new vaccines to combat PRRSV, adjuvants have been applied to PRRSV MLV vaccines to induce vaccination-mediated cross-protection against genetically dissimilar PRRSV strains. In chapter 3, we demonstrated that a commercial MontanideTM Gel 01 ST adjuvant provides enhanced protection to homologous PRRSV infection by regulating the production of PRRSV-specific antibodies. In chapter 4, we tested a novel peptide nanofiber hydrogel acting as a potent adjuvant for PRRSV MLV vaccines. We found that the hydrogel adjuvant enhanced vaccine efficacy by developing of higher titers of neutralizing antibodies and stronger IFN-γ cellular immune responses. Chinese highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) variants were isolated in 2006 and they belong to genotype 2 of PRRSV. Compared with classic PRRSV, HP-PRRSV is characterized by robust proliferation ability and high morbidity/mortality with all ages of pigs. In chapter 5, we compared the difference of immune responses elicited by HV-PRRSV, a Chinese HP-PRRSV, and a US virulent strain of PRRSV NADC- 20. Traditional PRRSV MLV vaccines developed in US offer no protection to HP-PRRSV. Vaccines specific to HP-PRRSV strains available in China provide protection to HP-PRRSV. In chapter 6, we demonstrated that pigs challenged with US NADC- 20 strain were protected by vaccination with Chinese MLV HP-PRRSV vaccines. The availability of Chinese HP-PRRSV vaccines in North America may act to increase the preparedness of possible transmission of HP-PRRSV to North America...|$|R
40|$|In many {{mammalian}} species, prenatal stress masculinizes {{female and}} feminizes male offspring impairing their reproductive capacity. Regrouping gestating sows is a common, stressful production practice, but {{its impact on}} the developing pigs of the sow is not fully known. This study examined the effects of regrouping gestating sows and the administration of exogenous glucocorticoids on the growth and external reproductive morphology of pigs. At 37. 2 ± 0. 26 d of gestation, 6 cohorts of 18 sows (N = 108) were placed in 1 of 3 treatments: socially stable (Stable), hydrocortisone acetate (HCA), or mixed (Mixed). The HCA sows were administered 70 mg HCA, a synthetic glucocorticoid, twice daily during the 21 d experimental period. Each Mixed sow was penned with 2 companion sows (Companion) and regrouped on d 7 and 14 with 2 different Companion sows in a new pen. Stable and HCA sows were penned in treatment groups of 3 sows. Sow social rank was assessed weekly during feeding. After the 21 d experimental period, all sows were housed in gestation stalls for the duration of pregnancy. During the 21 d, Companion sows gained more weight than HCA and Mixed sows (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) with Stable sows intermediate. High ranked sows gained more weight than middle and low ranked sows (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). Mixed sows had greater head lesion scores than Stable and HCA sows (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) with Companion sows intermediate. Head lesions increased with lower social rank (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). Sow treatment did not affect farrowing rate, litter size, or sex ratio (P 3 ̆e 0. 10). Social rank also had no effect on farrowing rate (P 3 ̆e 0. 10), but affected total litter size (P = 0. 03). High ranked sows bore and weaned more live females than low ranked sows (P 3 ̆c 0. 05), in part due to differential preweaning mortality among female pigs (P = 0. 01). Only male pigs were affected by <b>sow</b> treatment. Preweaning <b>mortality</b> was higher among male pigs from HCA than from Mixed sows (P = 0. 04) with other treatments intermediate. Despite no weight differences in the preweaning period, at 160 d of age males from HCA sows weighed more than males from Stable sows (P = 0. 01) with other treatments intermediate. Males born to Companion sows had longer relative anogenital distances, a marker of fetal testosterone exposure, than males from Mixed sows (P = 0. 03) with other treatments intermediate.

40|$|This {{study was}} done in the rural areas of uThukela District in KwaZulu-Natal. The {{objectives}} were to determine pig production and management practices used by farmers in rearing pigs in rural areas; to establish the role of pigs in social and economic lives of the people; and to characterize and determine constrains and opportunities of pig farming in rural areas. A farming systems approach was used in conjunction with a cross-sectional survey method using a structured questionnaire in face-to-face interviews with farmers for the collection of data. The study involved 4 local rural municipalities with a population of 4205 people who owned 2555 pigs. The sample size was 533 pig farmers/respondents. The data included the demographic characteristics of pig farmers, pig production and management practices, the role of pigs in both the social and economic lives of people and the constraints and opportunities of pig farming. The data were analyzed to determine simple means and frequencies. The results showed that 20 % of pigs were reared in intensive systems and 80 % in extensive systems in the district. Each village owned an average of 5 pigs. There were more female respondents (60 %) than males, and also female respondents owned more (65 %) pigs than males. Most of respondents (99 %) were Zulu speaking people and only 1 % was from other cultural groups. Majority of the respondents (74 %) were unemployed, 16 % were pensioners and only 10 % were employed. Those who were employed kept more pigs than the other groups. Over one third of the respondents had primary (34. 5 %) and secondary (35. 3 %) education; and 2. 7 % had college education, while 27. 5 % had no formal education at all. Sixty-two percent of the older respondents between the age of 46 and 65 years kept more pigs than younger farmers. The collective incomes of the communities from salaries, pensions, and sales of livestock and crops per annum were substantial. The average land size per household ranged from 0. 01 ha to 56 ha. Male respondents owned more land (1. 68 ha) than female respondents (0. 96 ha). Similarly, employed people owned more land (2. 49 ha) than pensioners (1. 26 ha) and the unemployed people (1. 04 ha). Respondents kept other livestock species such as cattle, sheep, goats and chickens. Ninety percent of households kept chickens in addition to cattle (53 %) and goats (49. 3 %). They also grew crops such as maize, potatoes, vegetables (cabbage, spinach, tomatoes, carrots, beetroots and onions) and fruits (peaches, apples and grapes). They kept pigs for home consumption (63 %), source of income (33 %), source of manure (3 %) and for other reasons (1 %). More employed people (68 %) sold pigs for extra income, while 91 % pensioners and 81 % unemployed people used pigs for home consumption. Marketing channels included pension pay points, abattoirs, butcheries and neighbourhoods. Abattoir sales accounted for 10 % and the most common venues were Amblecyte (40 %) and Cato Ridge (27 %). Selling of pigs occurred throughout the year, with the peak in winter (May/July). Majority of farmers (59 %) used their own transport to deliver pigs to the selling points or they used contractors (41 %). Pigs were sold at the age of 5 to 18 months old. Farmers sold live pigs and pork to the communities. Some farmers sold live pigs only, while others sold pork only or both pork and live pigs. Religion and culture had little influence on pig farming. Most farmers (88 %) had no religious or cultural influences, while 7 % were influenced by religion and 1 % was influenced by culture. The most preferred meat among the communities was chicken meat, followed by beef, pork, mutton and chevon. Half of the respondents had > 6 years of experience in pig farming, 34. 9 % had 2 – 5 years of experience and 14. 8 % were beginners. The breeds of pigs kept in the district included indigenous breeds, Large White, Landrace, Duroc and crosses of indigenous breeds with Large White and Landrace. Farmers bought breeding stock within their communities or they selected breeding stock from their own herds. Very few farmers have ever received any type of training in pig farming. The training was provided by the KZN Provincial Government, Zakhe Agricultural College and private farms. The training took 2 - 3 days of workshops, 2 - 3 weeks of short courses or 3 - 6 months of hands-on training on private farms. The training improved the performance of sows within the communities. Only 41 % of farmers practised controlled stock breeding, which improved the farrowing rate and litter size. About one third (32 %) of farmers bred their gilts at 6 – 8 months, while 21. 2 % bred them at 8 - 12 months, and 29 % bred them after 12 months. The farrowing rate of indigenous sows was one litter per annum compared with the majority of Landrace and Duroc sows that farrowed twice a year. Some farmers (28 %) reported that they routinely observed farrowing, while 72 % of them said they never knew when the sows farrowed until they saw sows and new litters coming back to their pens after grazing in the veld. The litter sizes varied from ≤ 7 to ≥ 10. Half of the indigenous sows farrowed ≤ 7 piglets per litter, while 41 % had 8 - 10 piglets; compared with 49 % Large White and 44 % Duroc that farrowed 8 - 10 and ≥ 10 per litter, respectively. Majority of farmers (66. 1 %) did not wean their piglets at all, which was associated with low farrowing rate. However, farmers who sold weaners for income weaned their piglets between 3 weeks and 3 months. This was associated with higher farrowing rate of <b>sows.</b> Piglet <b>mortality</b> was mainly due to worm infestation (26 %), loss of hair (13 %), lice and mange infestation (16. 4 %) and diarrhoea (5. 6 %). Despite that only 10 % of farmers consulted the local Department of Veterinary Services. Some farmers (44. 2 %) said {{that they did not know}} that they could make use of Veterinary services, and 28 % of them said it was a waste of time. Majority of farmers (80 %) used home kitchen swill and brewer’s grains to feed their pigs. Only 16 % of farmers bought commercial feeds and 2 % fed them on maize grains and vegetables. Commercial feeds were bought from Farm Save (48 %), Afgri (19 %) and Epol (7 %). Some farmers (65. 4 %) weighed feed before feeding, while 35 % did not weigh feed at all. Water was provided at feeding time, ad libitum or several times a day. Farmers disposed of carcasses by eating them, feeding to their dogs, or throwing them away. Over half of the farmers (52 %) did not take carcasses for post mortem, while 26 % did not know that they could send carcasses for post mortem and 20 % said they could not afford the cost. The study concluded that pigs have a vital social and economic role in the lives of the rural people of KZN for income generation and household consumption. The main constraints are wide spread poverty and lack of management skills in pig production, nutrition, health,housing and management. Government intervention is necessary to help farmers to improve pig production and management as a means of poverty alleviation and household food security. Agriculture and  Animal HealthM. Sc.

40|$|A new disease {{characterized}} by reproductive and respiratory problems emerged in Northern America and Western Europe {{in the late}} eighties, early nineties. It {{was caused by a}} porcine arterivirus, which based on the symptoms was called porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) (Meulenberg et al., 1993). On the two continents, two clearly different genetic/antigenic viruses were circulating: an American type (amPRRSV) and a European type (euPRRSV). Based on serological examinations, it was shown that amPRRSV circulated already earlier in Northern America and by genetic analysis, more genetic variation was detected for amPRRSV in Northern America than for euPRRSV in Western Europe. This latter finding could be attributed to the earlier circulation and/or multiple introductions of the virus in the American pig population. Western Europe was confronted with a single introduction, starting in Western Germany. As a consequence, the early euPRRSV strains were genetically closely related (Stadejek et al., 2002). In the early nineties, amPRRSV was proven to be more pathogenic than euPRRSV. Indeed, whereas both virus types had the same power to give reproductive problems upon infection during late gestation, amPRRSV was giving more general clinical signs (fever, anorexia) and respiratory problems than euPRRSV. Only in combinations with other pathogens/toxins euPRRSV was able to induce overt general and respiratory clinical signs (Van Reeth et al., 1996). By recombination and genetic drift, American strains evolved fast, giving rise to new strains that were even more virulent and extremely difficult to control by commercial vaccines (atypical PRRSV, <b>Sow</b> Abortion and <b>Mortality</b> Syndrome (SAMS)) (Mengeling et al., 1998). In 2006, extremely aggressive variants of amPRRSV appeared in China, which are now damaging the whole Asian pig population (long lasting high fever, respiratory and reproductive problems, high mortality) and which represent a real threat to other continents (Tian et al., 2007). In Eastern Europe, a surprisingly large variation was found for euPRRSV isolates leading to the identification of new subtypes (2, 3 and 4) that were quite different from subtype 1 (Stadejek et al., 2006). At present, it is hypothesized that euPRRSV was circulating in Eastern Europe a long time before the entrance of subtype 1 in Western Europe. When the whole group of Western and Eastern European euPRRSV strains are considered, a genetic variation of euPRRSV was found that was even larger than the one found with amPRRSV in the US, leading to a very complex genetic world picture of PRRSV. Eastern European PRRSV strains of subtype 2 (prototype Bor) and 3 (prototype Lena) {{have been shown to be}} more virulent than the Western European strains (subtype 1 (prototype Lelystad)) (Karniychuk et al., 2009). The euPRRSV strain Lena is even as virulent and pathogenic as the high fever disease amPRRSV in Asia. Over the years in Western Europe, euPRRSV remained mainly linked with reproductive problems. Fever and respiratory problems were absent upon experimental single inoculations. However, starting from mid 2013, PRRSV is responsible for flu-like problems in nurseries in Belgium and most probably also neighboring countries (unpublished data). Upon experimental inoculation with one of these isolates, Flanders 13, fever and respiratory problems were reproduced. Genetically, this virus is quite different from other circulating PRRS viruses. The pathogenesis of PRRSV is fully determined by differentiated macrophages. During the past 20 years, the euPRRSV strains of subtype 1 (prototype Lelystad) replicated very similarly in a pig (Duan et al., 1993). Targets are differentiated macrophages that are carrying the sialoadhesin receptor (Duan et al., Vanderheijden et al., 2010, Karniychuk et al., 2013). These cells can easily be found in tonsils and lungs, lymph nodes, spleen, maternal endometrium and fetal placenta and at lower levels in all other tissues of the pig (Karniychuk et al. 2009). Because the virus does not replicate well in the upper respiratory tract, the virus is difficult to isolate from nasal swabs and the virus does not spread fast between pigs (Albina, 1997). Due to the rather restricted number of differentiated cells that are infected, virus titers of 102 - 104 TCID 50 /ml are generally found in serum. EuPRRSV strains of subtype 3 (prototype Lena) differ from LV-like strains because they are able to infect a new subset of differentiated macrophages that do not possess the sialoadhesin receptor (Frydas et al. 2013). An additional receptor is most probably responsible for this. By experiments in nasal mucosa explants it was found that the additional subset is present at high concentrations in and under the respiratory epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract, allowing a much stronger replication in respiratory tissues (up to 10 - 100 x higher) and giving rise to a strong viral shedding and a fulminant viremia (100 x higher; virus titers up to 104 - 106 TCID 50 /ml). Based on the localisation of this new subset of susceptible macrophages, it is hypothesized that they represent nasal macrophages. These cells are forming a dense network and are taking care of the first line of defense against pathogens (Vareille et al., 2011). Destroying both nasal and alveolar lung macrophages is most probably the reason why euPRRSV Lena has been associated with secondary bacterial infections and sepsis (Karniychuk et al., 2010). The new Flanders 13 -like strains are euPRRSV subtype 1 strains that are also evolving in the same direction as Lena. By using the nasal mucosa explants, this virus also replicated in non-sialoadhesin positive macrophages. The virus titers in nasal secretions from euPRRSV infected animals are in line with the replication of the virus in nasal mucosa explants. Whereas it is difficult to detect LV-like euPRRSV subtype 1 in nasal secretions, it is very easy to do so with the more virulent euPRRSV subtype 3 and Flanders 13 -like strains. Transmission experiments with these different strains are ongoing in order to find out if the power of the virus to replicate in the nasal macrophages may be related to its aerogenic spread. The increase of macrophage subsets that are infected with euPRRSV in time is a dangerous evolution. A ten- to hundredfold increase of replication gives rise to viral mutants with the same magnitude. Knowing that mutagenesis is helping the virus to escape from immunity and is increasing the risk that highly virulent strains emerge is bringing Europe in a very dangerous situation. In addition, because of the close relationship of the porcine receptors sialoadhesin and CD 163 with their human homologs, one should consider the risk of a species jump to humans (Van Breedam et al., 2013). With these interesting findings with euPRRSV strains, we have recently performed experiments with amPRRSV strains in nasal mucosa explants. It was found that both old (VR 2332) and more recent amPRRSV strains (SDSU- 73, NADC, MN- 184) from the US easily replicate to high levels in both sialoadhesin positive and sialoadhesin negative macrophages in the nasal mucosa (unpublished data). This finding is explaining several things. AmPRRSV behaved differently from euPRRSV from the very beginning; it replicated in more subsets of macrophages than the old subtype 1 euPRRSV LV-like strains. Its high replication in the upper respiratory tract differs from the low level of replication of the old subtype 1 euPRRSV strains. This also explains why it was and still is very easy for amPRRSV to spread via airborne transmission (Otake et al., 2010). In addition, the higher number of macrophage subsets that are infected with amPRRSV explains why it is more virulent/pathogenic than the old subtype 1 euPRRSV strains and give more rise to secondary infections. It also explains why amPRRSV is able to replicate in sialoadhesin-negative pigs (Prather et al., 2013). All these findings are very important in function of the diagnosis. An etiological diagnosis of PRRS during reproductive failure is straightforward for all PRRSV strains. PRRSV is replicating in the macrophages of the fetal placenta when they become sialoadhesin positive at late gestation (Karniychuk et al., 2009). This results in a severe placentitis and viral spread to the fetus. The placentitis is the main cause of fetal pathology and death (Karniychuk et al., 2013). Due to the huge size of the placenta and the regularly localized PRRSV replication, it is difficult to make the diagnosis from placental tissues (which part to take?). Because fetuses do not have the time to develop antibodies before they die, it is impossible to diagnose PRRS by serological examinations on fetal fluids. Taking all these pathogenetic aspects into account, it is advised to do the diagnosis of PRRS during reproductive problems by qRT-PCR on umbilical cords (connected with fetal placenta) and organ pools (lungs/spleen) of aborted fetuses. Diagnosis of euPRRS in the context of respiratory problems is very difficult with LV-like euPRRSV strains. They are always causing long-lasting infections in young piglets, independent of their health status (diseased or healthy). Therefore, what is the meaning of a positive result (demonstrating the presence of the virus in lungs or blood). In the same context, it is difficult to interpret a seroconversion. It is not because an animal is seroconverting to LV-like euPRRSV strains that the virus is responsible for problems. This diagnostic problem is one of the main reasons why most farmers did not vaccinate their piglets up till now in Western Europe. However, in pigs with flu-like problems caused by amPRRSV, subtype 2 and 3 euPRRSV and the new Flanders 13 -like euPRRSV, it is easy to demonstrate the high replication of PRRSV in the upper respiratory tract by taking nasal swabs and blood and quantitating the high viral load (up to 105 TCID 50 /ml in nasal secretions and 104 - 6 TCID 50 /ml in blood) by virus titration or qRT-PCR. PRRSV is a difficult target for the immunity. Several branches of the immunity have been shown not to be induced or not to be functional. Low levels of interferons are induced (Van Reeth et al., 1999). Antibodies are raised starting from 8 days post infection, but it takes several weeks before a weak neutralization can be demonstrated (Labarque et al., 2000). Natural killer cells and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes are not sufficiently effective (Cao et al., 2013; Costers et al., 2009). Only neutralizing antibodies, which appear after one month and at low levels together with a not yet identified porcine killer cell are the two branches that still can do the job and should be activated by vaccination. The drift of the virus makes it a moving target and complicates the whole vaccination strategy (Labarque et al, 2004). In the near future, it is important to have access to vaccines that are adaptable, enclosing strains that are closely related to the strains circulating in the field (Nauwynck et al., 2012). The technologies for making effective adaptable inactivated (Geldhof et al., 2012) and attenuated vaccines (unpublished data) became available and should be urgently implemented in the field. The ultimate dream is the development of an adaptable marker vector vaccine (cassette system) that induces a local immunity in the respiratory tract. As long as PRRSV does not persist such as its sister-arterivirus, lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus (LDV), we should keep on going with the investment to develop vaccines. In conclusion, it is extremely important to better control PRRS in the near future and not to wait till a complete catastrophe occurs. There is an urgent need for adaptable inactivated and attenuated marker vaccines and improved biosafety measures in order to fully control PRRSV circulation. Pig producers, PRRS researchers and pharmaceutical companies should take their responsibility and join forces to come up with solutions to eradicate this ever-changing enemy that may turn into a real nightmare. In this context, funding PRRS research should be prioritized by all agencies all over the world. Not doing this is an unforgivable error not only for animal health but possibly also for human health...|$|R
