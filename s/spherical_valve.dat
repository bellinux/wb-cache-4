Valve body parts are the core components of large <b>spherical</b> <b>valve,</b> which directly determine the quality and service life of large <b>spherical</b> <b>valve.</b> In this paper, three processing technologies for one large <b>spherical</b> <b>valve</b> body are proposed, which are die forging, ring rolling and combined ring rolling. Based on SIMUFACT software platform, FE simulations for forming processes with three technologies are carried out, and the forming effects of three processing technologies are evaluated by compare the forming forces, forming accuracies and material utilizations among three forming processes. It is obtained that combined ring rolling technology has less force consumption, well forming accuracy and high material utilization compared to the other two technologies, and it can be regarded as an advanced processing technology for low-consumption, high-performance production of large <b>spherical</b> <b>valve</b> body...|$|E

The forces and the moments acting on the rotor through the piston rod have been derived from geometric analysis of rotor driving mechanism with the piston rod. An analysis model on mixed lubrication between the rotor and the <b>spherical</b> <b>valve</b> plate has been shown using Average-Flow-Model by Patir-Cheng and the contact theory by Greenwood-Tripp, respectively. In addition, bearing part between the rotor and shaft, supporting element of the rotor, has been regarded as squeeze film bearing.

A calibration test was carried out by comparing countings from the automatic equipment with those obtained by the standard laboratory cell. Results of an operational check over a period of approximately one year indicate that variations in radon at the calibration site are attributable more to meteorological than to tectonic causes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{constructs}} {{three types}} of bioprosthetic valve leaflets ’ parametric model via computer aided design, a series of accurate parameters of the bioproshtetic heart valve, such as radius of the sutural ring, height of the supporting stent and inclination of the supporting stent, are determined. Numerical simulation is {{used to determine the}} effect of different shape designs on the mechanical performance of the bioprosthetic valve leaflet. The dynamic behavior of the valve during diastolic phase is analyzed. The finite element analysis results show the stress distribution of the ellipsoidal and <b>spherical</b> <b>valve</b> leaflets are comparatively reasonable. The ellipsoidal and <b>spherical</b> <b>valve</b> leaflets have the following advantages over the cylindrical leaflet valve, lower peak von-Mises stress, smaller stress concentration area, and relatively uniform stress distribution. The ellipsoidal and <b>spherical</b> <b>valve</b> leaflets may contribute to the long term durability of the valve. This work is very helpful to manufacture valvular leaflets with reasonable shapes and to prolong the lifetime of the bioprosthetic heart valve...|$|E
40|$|The motion {{behavior}} of a rotor for a <b>spherical</b> <b>valve</b> plate has been measured in a bent-axis-type axial piston pump. The {{behavior of}} the rotor is represented in two-dimensional polar form and by the minimum film thickness between the rotor and the <b>spherical</b> <b>valve</b> plate. In {{the case of a}} pressurizing suction port, (1) the attitude angle of the rotor and the azimuth angle of the rotor increase as the operating conditions become severe, (2) the minimum film thickness is related to bearing modulus, and (3) the behavior of the rotor is quasi-static motion. In the case of a reducing suction port, the minimum film thickness increases as the pump delivery pressure increases...|$|E

The information coming from the flow field solution is used to identify regions having higher probability to be impacted by particles dragged by the fluid, and to estimate the erosion potential of solid particles having different size. The value of the kinetic energy of particles approaching the walls of the geometric domain is used to estimate the amount of material potentially eroded by impacting particles, and to provide a potential correlation between ISO 4406 and NAS 1638 solid contamination level classification. The long-term target is a numerical estimation of service life in hydraulic components...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{water hammer}} effects caused by closure of spherical valves against the discharge. During {{the first phase}} of {{modernisation}} of Perućica high-head hydropower plant (HPP), Montenegro, safety spherical valves(inlet turbine valves) have been refurbished on the first two Pelton turbine units. The valve closure is controlled by the valve actuator (hydraulic servomotor). Because the torque acting on the valve body is dependent on flow conditions the valve closing time may vary significantly fordifferent flow velocities (passive valve). For the passive valve the torques acting on the valve body should be considered in the valve model. The valve closing time results from numerical simulation. On the contrary, for the active valve the valve closing time is assumed prior to simulation. The <b>spherical</b> <b>valve</b> boundary condition is incorporated into the method of characteristics (MOC) algorithm. The staggered (diamond) grid in applying the MOC is used in this paper. The passive valve boundary condition is described by the water hammer equations, the valve equation that relates discharge to pressure head drop and the dynamic equation of the valve body motion (torque equation). The active valve boundary condition is described by the first two equations, respectively. Standard quasi-steady friction model is used for estimating friction losses in plants tunnel and penstocks. Numerical results using both the active and the passive <b>spherical</b> <b>valve</b> models are compared with results of measurements. It has been found that the influence of flow conditions on the <b>spherical</b> <b>valve</b> closing time is minor for the cases considered. Computed and measured results agree reasonably well...|$|E

40|$|In 178 patients, a {{randomized}} prospective {{comparison between the}} 60 ° spherical disc Björk-Shiley (BS) and the St Jude Medical (SJM) heart valve prostheses was performed. Four-week perioperative mortality was zero in the BS (n = 84) and 4. 3 % in the SJM group (n = 94). During a mean (± SD) follow-up of 52 ± 20 months or 778 patient-years, late cardiac mortality per year was 2. 4 % in the BS and 2. 2 % in the SJM group. The yearly thromboembolic rates were 1. 4 % in the BS and 2. 0 % in the SJM group. There was no mechanical valve failure or haemolytic anaemia. Paravalvular leaks and major bleeding complications occurred at low rates in both groups (1. 1 % and 2. 2 % per year in BS; 0. 7 % and 1. 7 % per year in SJM). Functional results were similarly good with 96 % of patients with BS valves and 95 % of patients with SJM prostheses being in NYHA classes I and II, respectively.

40|$|The Veterans Administration Cooperative Study on Valvular Heart Disease was {{organized}} to compare survival and incidence of valve-related complications between patients receiving a bioprosthesis (the Hancock porcine heterograft) and a mechanical prosthesis (the Björk-Shiley <b>spherical</b> disc <b>valve).</b> Five hundred seventy-five patients undergoing single aortic or mitral valve replacement were randomized at surgery {{to one of}} the two valve types. At an average follow-up of 5 years (range 3 to 8) there are no statistically significant differences in survival between patients with the two valve types in the aortic valve replacement group. There is a statistically nonsignificant trend toward improved survival in patients undergoing mitral valve replacement with a bioprosthesis compared with a mechanical prosthesis (5 year survival probability was 0. 70 ± 0. 05 and 0. 58 ± 0. 06, respectively). Fatal and nonfatal valve-related complications occurred significantly less frequently in patients with a bioprosthesis compared with a mechanical prosthesis for both mitral and aortic valve replacement. Five year complication-free probability was 0. 67 ± 0. 05 and 0. 45 ± 0. 06, respectively, for patients with mitral valve replacement and 0. 63 ± 0. 04 and 0. 53 ± 0. 04, respectively, for those with aortic valve replacement. The difference in overall complication rates was largely due to the increased number of clinically significant but nonfatal bleeding episodes in patients receiving a mechanical prosthesis. Adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics between patients receiving a mitral mechanical prosthesis and a mitral bioprosthesis reduced the statistical significance of the difference in both mortality and complications...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Hydram pump {{has been}} found {{more than two centuries}} ago, and has been widely {{developed}} and operated to this day. However, constraints complaints by the people are easily damaged on its rubber of waste valve and delivery valve of the hydram pump. In addition, the reliability of the plate valve models is also awfully where its rubber of the valve is quickly worn or damaged. It has been reducing the interest of the community in utilizing hydram pumps. Moreover, there is no yet a comprehensive procedure in planning and making dimensions of hydram pump. Then, design of a <b>spherical</b> shaped delivery <b>valve</b> model on the hydram pump has been made and tested. Considering that hydram pump is also called impulse pump which work due to the effects of water hammer, therefore, it need to know the forces that take place in the hydram pump. Then, from these forces can be calculated dimensions of hydram pump and its performance can be predicted. From {{the results of the study}} shows that dimensions and performance of the hydram pump is very close to the results of assessment that has been done.

40|$|Objective—To {{establish}} {{whether there}} is more psychological distress among recipients of Björk-Shiley convexo-concave (BScc) valves than among recipients of other valves not known to fracture.  Design—Cross sectional study.  Patients— 137 patients who received either a BScc valve or a Sorin Biomedical <b>spherical</b> <b>valve</b> during a randomised trial between 1982  and 1983  at St Antonius Hospital, Nieuwegein. Systematic notification {{of the risk of}} strut fracture in recipients of BScc valves was carried out at St Antonius Hospital in 1991.  Mean outcome measures—Psychological distress as assessed with the General Severity Index from the Symptom Checklist 90.   Results—Psychological distress between recipients of BScc and Sorin valves did not differ irrespective of whether the recipients knew their valve type. More recipients of BScc valves, however, knew their valve type and of problems associated with artificial heart valves.  Conclusions—Information about an increased risk of strut fracture does not induce psychological distress among well informed recipients of BScc valves. All recipients of heart valves should be systematically informed about their valve type—for example, by issuing data cards with valve serial numbers and other relevant information.    Keywords: psychological distress;  artificial heart valves;  Björk-Shiley valve...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjective: Prophylactic {{replacement}} of Björk-Shiley convexo-concave valves (Shiley, Inc., Irvine, Calif.) has been advised for selected groups of patients. If prophylactic replacement is considered, risks of postoperative {{morbidity and mortality}} have to be weighed against benefits of replacement. Here we report the results of prophylactic {{replacement of}} Björk-Shiley convexo-concave valves at risk of strut fracture in The Netherlands. Methods: We reviewed medical records of 36 patients undergoing prophylactic replacement of their Björk-Shiley convexo-concave valves before August 1995. Replacement was judged to be prophylactic if the risk of strut fracture outweighed that of death from reoperation, or the patient wished to have the valve replaced {{although it was not}} recommended. The procedure was also considered to be prophylactic if a concomitant pathologic condition, not likely to require cardiac surgery in the near future, was present or if preoperative examination revealed an unexpected cardiac pathologic condition. Results: Twenty-two 70 -degree and 16 60 -degree Björk-Shiley convexo-concave valves and one <b>spherical</b> <b>valve</b> were replaced (25 aortic and 14 mitral, including three double-valve replacements). Early mortality was 2. 8 % (1 / 36) (exact 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0. 1 to 14. 5). Mean follow-up was 33 months. One- and 3 -year survivals were 94 % (95 % CI 79 % to 99 %) and 91 % (95 % CI 74 % to 97 %), respectively. All three deaths were sudden. Conclusions: If special care is taken in selecting patients, the risk of prophylactic replacement is comparable to that of primary valve replacement. More data are needed to assess whether the risk of sudden death is possibly increased. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1998 : 115 : 577 - 81...|$|E
