50|$|Subscribers paid {{an annual}} rental, which covered <b>switching</b> <b>fees</b> and {{operator}} costs. Landowners paid a tax levy on phone lines running through their property, which covered repairing and building lines. The levy {{was based on}} the quarters of land through which telephone lines ran. There were two rates. A quarter of land which had a line passing through it paid a 'straight' rate, and a quarter of land in which someone lived and had a phone paid a higher 'take-off' rate. Since the 'straight' rate levy was charged regardless of whether the owner had phone service, land owners without phones could be paying as much or more as land owners with phone service. In spite of attempts to reform this system, it remained in place until the government took over the service. In addition to the annual rental and line levy, there was a special levy to pay back the debenture.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} a comprehensive {{analysis of the}} relative ability of three information sets—daily trading volume, intraday returns and overnight returns—to predict equity volatility. We investigate {{the extent to which}} statistical accuracy of one-day-ahead forecasts translates into economic gains for technical traders. Various profitability criteria and utility-based <b>switching</b> <b>fees</b> indicate that the largest gains stem from combining historical daily returns with volume information. Using common statistical loss functions, the largest degree of predictive power is found instead in intraday returns. Our analysis thus reinforces the view that statistical significance does not have a direct mapping onto economic value. As a byproduct, we show that buying the stock when the forecasted volatility is extremely high appears largely profitable, suggesting a strong return-risk relationship in turbulent conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{conventional}} wisdom in economic theory holds that switching costs make markets less competitive. This paper challenges this claim. We formulate an empirically realistic model of dynamic price competition {{that allows for}} differentiated products and imperfect lock-in. We calibrate this model with data from frequently purchased packaged goods markets. These data are ideal {{in the sense that}} they have the necessary variation to separately identify switching costs from consumer heterogeneity. Equally important, consumers exhibit inertia in their brand choices, a form of psychological switching cost. This makes our results applicable to the broad range of products that are distinctly identified (i. e. branded) rather than just to those products for which there is a product adoption cost or explicit <b>switching</b> <b>fee.</b> In our simulations, prices are as much as 18 per cent lower with than without switching costs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the fees collection {{system in the}} Peruvian pension system and evaluates <b>switching</b> from <b>fees</b> on flow to fees on assets, which has several advantages. These advantages include {{the fact that it}} makes the fees that the pension company charges for the service it provides more transparent by considering the assets being managed (the pension fund), and not the memberÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s salary, as the basis. The paper concludes that, at the moment, the Peruvian private pension system has reached sufficient maturity so as to consider implementing a fee in Individual Account Pension Systems, which would make the system management and supervision process more transparent. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{contract}} was simple and straightforward. The company, CIC, promised {{to maintain and}} provide the specified accommodation type (a studio, one bedroom, or two bedroom unit) {{for use by the}} [...] "license owner" [...] for a period of 25 years (until 1999 from 1974, for example) in the specified season and number of weeks agreed upon, with only two extra charges: a $15.00 per diem (per night) rate, frozen at that cost {{for the life of the}} contract. The contract had a $25.00 <b>switching</b> <b>fee,</b> should the licensee decide to use their time at one of the other resorts. The {{contract was}} based on the fact that the cost of the license, and the small per diem, compared with the projected increase in the cost of hotel rates over 25 years to over $100.00 per night, would save the license owner many vacation dollars over the span of the license agreement. Between 1974 and 1999, in the United States, inflation boosted the current cost of the per diem to $52.00, validating the cost savings assumption. The license owner was allowed to rent, or give their week away as a gift in any particular year. The only stipulation was that the $15.00 per diem must be paid every year whether the unit was occupied or not. This [...] "must be paid yearly fee" [...] would become the roots of what is known today as [...] "maintenance fees", once the Florida Department of Real Estate became involved in regulating timeshares.|$|R
40|$|The {{covariance}} between {{stock and}} bond returns plays important roles in the setting up of asset allocation strategies and portfolio diversification. In the present study, we propose a multivariate range-based volatility model incorporating dynamic copulas into a range-based volatility model to describe the volatility and dependence structures of {{stock and bond}} returns. We {{then go on to}} assess the economic value of the covariance forecasts based on our proposed model under a mean-variance framework. The out-of-sample forecasting performance reveals that investors {{would be willing to pay}} between 39 and 2081 basis points per year to switch from a dynamic trading strategy under the return-based volatility model to a dynamic trading strategy under the range-based volatility model, with more risk-averse investors being willing to pay even higher <b>switching</b> <b>fees.</b> Furthermore, additional economic gains of between 33 and 1471 annualized basis points are achieved when taking the leverage effect into consideration.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine effects of realized covariance matrix estimators based on intraday returns on large-scale minimum-variance equity portfolio optimization. We empirically assess out-of-sample performance of portfolios with different covariance matrix estimators: the realized covariance matrix estimators and Bayesian shrinkage estimators based on the past monthly and daily returns. The main results are: (1) the realized covariance matrix estimators using the past intraday returns yield a lower standard deviation of the large-scale portfolio returns than the Bayesian shrinkage estimators based on the monthly and daily historical returns; (2) gains to switching to strategies using the realized covariance matrix estimators are higher for an investor with higher relative risk aversion; and (3) the better portfolio performance of the realized covariance approach implied by ex-post returns in excess of the risk-free rate, the standard deviations of the excess returns, the return per unit of risk (Sharpe ratio) and the <b>switching</b> <b>fees</b> seems to be robust to the level of transaction costs.

5000|$|Customer {{switching}} costs: Burnham, Frels, and Mahajan (2003, p. 110) define {{switching costs}} as [...] "one-time costs that customers {{associate with the}} process of switching from one provider to another." [...] Customers usually encounter three types of switching costs: (1) financial <b>switching</b> costs (e.g., <b>fees</b> to break contract, lost reward points); (2) procedural switching costs (time, effort, and uncertainty in locating, adopting, and using a new brand/provider); and (3) relational switching costs (personal relationships and identification with brand and employees). A recent meta-analysis examined 233 effects from over 133,000 customers and found that all three types of switching costs increased customer retention—however, relational switching costs have the strongest association with customer repurchase intentions and behavior.|$|R

As hospitals had a transition period of several years to complete the switch, we can adopt a difference-in-differences approach by adding hospital fixed effects and a time trend. Our results support hypotheses drawn from an incentive and selection perspective: PPS reduces the length of stay of older relative to younger patients, of more severe relative to less severe cases, and in smaller relative to larger hospitals. Hospitals which adopted PPS earlier provide higher quality under PPS as proxied by the case-specific readmission rate...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In the parlance of {{regulatory}} economics, “pass through ” {{refers to the}} effect of a change in an incremental cost – generally, the effect of a change in a regulated input price – on the retail price of a good or service. In this paper we examine pass through with regard to the <b>switched</b> access <b>fees</b> paid by long distance companies to local exchange carriers in the United States. We estimate the degree to which long distance companies pass through differences in access rates to their customers, and we examine whether mandates imposed by regulators on long distance companies to pass through access fee reductions to customers affect the extent of pass through. We evaluate annual panel data on intrastate long-distance revenues, access expenses, and minutes of use from 2004 to 2008 in each of the 50 states in the U. S. using a proprietary and detailed data set. We leverage the fact that some states have accompanied access rate reductions with pass through mandates, and others have not. Using standard multivariate regression techniques our results are consistent with 100 % pass through of access rate reductions in states that have undergone regulatory access reform. We also find that a regulatory mandate on long distance companies to pass through access rate reductions has no statistically significant effect on the magnitude of access fee pass through, supporting the economic hypothesis that pas...|$|R

Several factors expected to affect external audit fees determination are client’s complexity, client’s size, litigation risks, type of auditor, and auditor switching. These factors are expected to increase external audit fees. In addition, this study also linked the implementation of IFRS and auditing are still few in Indonesia. This study is a modification of the study De George’s et al (2013). This study is modified by adding independent variables and used secondary data from non-financial companies which listed on Bursa Efek Indonesia (BEI) in 2011 and 2012. This study uses purposive sampling method and obtains sample of 128 companies. The effect of client’s complexity, client’s size, litigation risks, type of auditor, auditor <b>switching</b> and audit <b>fees</b> are tested using multiple linear regression analysis contained in SPSS 16. Before being conducted the regression test, it is examined by using the classical assumption tests. The {{results of this study}} indicate that client’s complexity, client’s size, and, type of auditor have significant relationship on external audit fees. Whereas, litigation risks and auditor switching do not have significant relationship on external audit fees.

40|$|Several {{previous}} {{studies have examined the}} impact of auditor <b>switching</b> on audit <b>fees.</b> The underpinning theory of these studies is that a potential new auditor will cut initial audit fees (low ball) in order to secure an audit, and the ensuing stream of audit fees including a quasi-rent component payable to any incumbent auditor. Empirical evidence of the presence of audit fee cutting subsequent to an auditor switch is mixed. The present study proposes an alternative theory which argues that a potential new auditor will low ball in order to secure an audit but that such fee cutting is conditional on non-audit services (NAS) growth between the year prior to the auditor change and {{the first year of the}} new audit engagement. That is, the audit fee cut will be recouped by revenue generated from the provision of auditor supplied non-audit services. The study is based on data from 270 publicly listed Australian companies taken at a time when NAS fees provided by incumbent auditors were rising. The empirical evidence shows that auditees who report an auditor change together with real growth in the fees for auditor supplied non-audit services, show a significantly lower audit fee than situations in which these two conditions do not exist together. A number of limitations are discussed, including generalizability to other time periods and markets...|$|R
