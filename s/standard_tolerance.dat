50|$|When {{designing}} mechanical components, {{a system}} of standardized tolerances called International Tolerance grades are often used. The standard (size) tolerances are divided into two categories: hole and shaft. They are labelled with a letter (capitals for holes and lowercase for shafts) and a number. For example: H7 (hole, tapped hole, or nut) and h7 (shaft or bolt). H7/h6 is a very common <b>standard</b> <b>tolerance</b> which gives a tight fit. The tolerances work {{in such a way}} that for a hole H7 means that the hole should be made slightly larger than the base dimension (in this case for an ISO fit 10+0.015−0, meaning that it may be up to 0.015 mm larger than the base dimension, and 0 mm smaller). The actual amount bigger/smaller depends on the base dimension. For a shaft of the same size h6 would mean 10+0-0.009, which means the shaft may be as small as 0.009 mm smaller than the base dimension and 0 mm larger. This method of standard tolerances is also known as Limits and Fits and can be found in ISO 286-1:2010 (Link to ISO catalog).|$|E

It is known that the major costs of this scheme is {{in the evaluation of}} the Hammerstein operator occurring on the right-hand side of (1), which on the grid outlined above requires N^ 4 operations. Owing to the convolutional structure of the operator, it is possible to decrease considerably the computational cost of each function evaluation by performing a pseudo-spectral evaluation of the convolution, using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), followed by an inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT). This reduces the number of operations to O(N^ 2 N^ 2) and allows one to simulate neural fields and compute equilibria efficiently. We refer the reader to [16, 21] for further details.

Study Design: Five-year follow-up study of 30 female education majors, initially documented with a standard voice assessment and a vocal endurance test. Measurements before and after vocal endurance testing were compared and related to the vocal outcome 5 years after the initial testing. Methods: Voice assessment included perceptual evaluation, airflow measurements, Fo and SPL measurements, voice range profile and laryngeal (stroboscopic) examination.

30|$|In this article, {{based on}} early works on forward-and-backward (FAB) {{diffusion}} schemes [38, 50], where the smoothing and sharpening actions are combined {{in the same}} diffusion process system, we propose a scale-based forward-and-backward diffusion (SFABD) scheme. The main idea of the proposed scheme is that {{the magnitude of the}} diffusion coefficient at each pixel is determined by taking into account the local property of the image through the scales. This is performed using the notion of the Minimum Reliable Scale (MRS) as proposed by Elder and Zucker [18]. This technique is based on statistical reliability of the edge detection operator responses at different scales [51]. The reliable scale as defined by Elder and Zucker, means that at the selected scale and larger ones, the likelihood of error due to sensor noise is below a <b>standard</b> <b>tolerance.</b> By choosing the MRS, for edge detection at each pixel in the image, we prevent errors due to sensor noise while simultaneously minimizing errors due to interference from nearby structure. Such a multiscale measure along with the gradient can capture more accurately edges over a wide range of blur and contrasts. Using this concept, a MRS-based diffusivity function is proposed. As a result, the proposed scheme can adaptively encourage strong smoothing in homogeneous regions, while suitable sharpening in detail and edge regions. Furthermore, we modify the Perona-Malik [50] discrete scheme by taking edge orientations into account.|$|E
