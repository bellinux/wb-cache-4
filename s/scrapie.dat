5|$|A few sheep {{conditions}} are transmissible to humans. Orf (also known as scabby mouth, contagious ecthyma or soremouth) is a skin disease leaving lesions that is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact. Cutaneous anthrax is also called woolsorter's disease, as the spores {{can be transmitted}} in unwashed wool. More seriously, the organisms that can cause spontaneous enzootic abortion in sheep are easily transmitted to pregnant women. Also of concern are the prion disease <b>scrapie</b> and {{the virus that causes}} foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), as both can devastate flocks. The latter poses a slight risk to humans. During the 2001 FMD pandemic in the UK, hundreds of sheep were culled and some rare British breeds were at risk of extinction due to this.|$|E
5|$|All known prion diseases, collectively called {{transmissible}} spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), are untreatable and fatal. However, {{a vaccine}} developed in mice may provide insight into providing a vaccine to resist prion infections in humans. Additionally, in 2006 scientists announced that they had genetically engineered cattle lacking a necessary gene for prion production– thus theoretically making them immune to BSE, building on research indicating that mice lacking normally occurring prion protein are resistant to infection by <b>scrapie</b> prion protein. In 2013, a study revealed that 1 in 2,000 people in the United Kingdom might harbour the infectious prion protein that causes vCJD.|$|E
5|$|Animals are {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} diseases and conditions that may affect their health. Some, like classical swine fever and <b>scrapie</b> are specific to one type of stock, while others, like foot-and-mouth disease affect all cloven-hoofed animals. Where the condition is serious, governments impose regulations on import and export, on the movement of stock, quarantine restrictions and the reporting of suspected cases. Vaccines are available against certain diseases, and antibiotics are widely used where appropriate. At one time, antibiotics were routinely added to certain compound foodstuffs to promote growth, but this practice is now frowned on in many countries because of the risk that it may lead to antibiotic resistance. Animals living under intensive conditions are particularly prone to internal and external parasites; increasing numbers of sea lice are affecting farmed salmon in Scotland. Reducing the parasite burdens of livestock results in increased productivity and profitability.|$|E
5|$|Until 2015 {{all known}} {{mammalian}} prion diseases {{were considered to}} be caused by the prion protein, PrP; in 2015 Multiple System Atrophy was found to be likely caused by a new prion, the misfolded form of a protein called alpha-synuclein. The endogenous, properly folded form of the prion protein is denoted PrPC (for Common or Cellular), whereas the disease-linked, misfolded form is denoted PrPSc (for <b>Scrapie),</b> after one of the diseases first linked to prions and neurodegeneration.) The precise structure of the prion is not known, though they can be formed by combining PrPC, polyadenylic acid, and lipids in a protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) reaction. Proteins showing prion-type behavior are also found in some fungi, which has been useful in helping to understand mammalian prions. Fungal prions do not appear to cause disease in their hosts.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, Stanley Prusiner {{discovered}} prions {{and showed}} that they cause <b>scrapie.</b>|$|E
25|$|Proper {{autoclave}} treatment will inactivate all resistant bacterial spores {{in addition}} to fungi, bacteria, and viruses, but {{is not expected to}} eliminate all prions, which vary in their resistance. For prion elimination, various recommendations state 121-132°C for 60 minutes or 134°C for at least 18 minutes. The 263K <b>scrapie</b> prion is inactivated relatively quickly by such sterilization procedures; however, other strains of <b>scrapie,</b> and strains of CJD and BSE are more resistant. Using mice as test animals, one experiment showed that heating BSE positive brain tissue at 134-138°C for 18 minutes resulted in only a 2.5 log decrease in prion infectivity.|$|E
25|$|BSE is a {{transmissible}} disease that primarily affects {{the central nervous}} system; it {{is a form of}} transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, like Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and kuru in humans and <b>scrapie</b> in sheep, and chronic wasting disease in cervids.|$|E
25|$|South-African born {{physicist}} and radiobiologist Tikvah Alper(1909–95), {{working in the}} UK, developed many fundamental insights into biological mechanisms, including the (negative) discovery that the infective agent in <b>scrapie</b> {{could not be a}} virus or other eukaryotic structure.|$|E
25|$|Biochemist Colm Kelleher, who has {{investigated}} several purported mutilations first-hand, {{argues that the}} mutilations are most likely a clandestine U.S. Government effort to track the spread of Bovine spongiform encephalopathy ("mad cow disease") and related diseases, such as <b>scrapie.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2016, {{the first}} case of CWD in Europe was from the Nordfjella free ranging {{reindeer}} in Southern Norway. Scientists surveyed the diseased female reindeer until the reindeer died and used the carcass to isolate the prions. The main origin of CWD to Norway is still unknown, whereas importation of infected deer was the contamination source in South Korea. Norway has strict legislation and rules not allowing importation of live animals and cervids into the country. Norway has had a <b>scrapie</b> surveillance program since 1997; while no reports of <b>scrapie</b> {{within the range of}} Nordfjella reindeer sup population have been identified, sheep are herded through that region and are a potential source of infection.|$|E
25|$|Scientists have {{investigated}} using RNA interference {{to slow the}} progression of <b>scrapie</b> in mice. The RNA blocks production of the protein that the CJD process transforms into prions. This research is unlikely {{to lead to a}} human therapy for many years.|$|E
500|$|During the 1960s, two London-based researchers, {{radiation}} biologist Tikvah Alper and biophysicist John Stanley Griffith, {{developed the}} hypothesis that some transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are caused by an infectious agent consisting solely of proteins. Earlier investigations by E. J. Field into <b>scrapie</b> and kuru had identified the transfer of pathologically inert polysaccharides that only become infectious in the host. Alper and Griffith wanted {{to account for the}} discovery that the mysterious infectious agent causing the diseases <b>scrapie</b> and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease resisted ionizing radiation. [...] (A single ionizing [...] "hit" [...] normally destroys an entire infectious particle, and the dose needed to hit half the particles depends {{on the size of the}} particles. Empirical results of ionizing doses applied to the unknown infectious substance evidenced an infectious particle size too small to be a viral mechanism.) ...|$|E
500|$|Prions are {{infectious}} protein {{molecules that}} do not contain DNA or RNA. They can cause infections such as <b>scrapie</b> in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy ("mad cow" [...] disease) in cattle, and chronic wasting disease in deer; in humans, prionic diseases include Kuru, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, and Gerstmann–Sträussler–Scheinker syndrome. Although prions are fundamentally different from viruses and viroids, their discovery gives credence to the theory that viruses could have evolved from self-replicating molecules.|$|E
500|$|Prions were {{initially}} {{identified as the}} causative agent in animal TSEs derived from <b>scrapie</b> in sheep and later bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)—known popularly as [...] "mad cow disease". [...] Human prion diseases include Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) and its variant (vCJD), Gerstmann–Sträussler–Scheinker syndrome, fatal familial insomnia, and kuru. [...] All known prion diseases in mammals affect {{the structure of the}} brain or other neural tissue. No effective medical treatment is known. The illness is progressive and always fatal.|$|E
500|$|Francis Crick {{recognized}} the potential significance [...] of the Griffith protein-only hypothesis for <b>scrapie</b> propagation {{in the second}} edition of his [...] "Central dogma of molecular biology" [...] (1970): While asserting that the flow of sequence information from protein to protein, or from protein to RNA and DNA was [...] "precluded", he noted that Griffith's hypothesis was a potential contradiction (although {{it was not so}} promoted by Griffith). [...] The revised hypothesis was later formulated, in part, to accommodate reverse transcription (which both Howard Temin and David Baltimore discovered in 1970).|$|E
500|$|A University of California {{research}} team, led by Nobel Prize winner Stanley Prusiner, {{has provided}} evidence for the theory that infection can occur from prions in manure. [...] And, since manure is present in many areas surrounding water reservoirs, as well as used on many crop fields, it raises the possibility of widespread transmission. [...] It was reported in January 2011 that researchers had discovered prions spreading through airborne transmission on aerosol particles, in an animal testing experiment focusing on <b>scrapie</b> infection in laboratory mice. [...] Preliminary evidence supporting the notion that prions can be transmitted through use of urine-derived human menopausal gonadotropin, administered {{for the treatment of}} infertility, was published in 2011.|$|E
500|$|A {{gene for}} the normal protein has been identified: the PRNP gene. In all {{inherited}} cases of prion disease, {{there is a}} mutation in the PRNP gene. [...] Many different PRNP mutations have been identified and these proteins {{are more likely to}} fold into abnormal prion. Although this discovery puts a hole in the general prion hypothesis, that prions can aggregate only proteins of identical amino acid make-up. [...] These mutations can occur throughout the gene. Some mutations involve expansion of the octapeptide repeat region at the N-terminal of PrP. Other mutations that have been identified as a cause of inherited prion disease occur at positions 102, 117 & 198 (GSS), 178, 200, 210 & 232 (CJD) and 178 (Fatal Familial Insomnia, FFI). [...] The cause of prion disease can be , genetic, or infectious, or a combination of these factors. For example, to have <b>scrapie,</b> both an infectious agent and a susceptible genotype must be present.|$|E
2500|$|A control {{flock of}} Swaledales {{has been used}} to study and develop scrapie-resistant sheep. [...] An infectious, persistent, and {{spontaneous}} disease, animals infected with <b>scrapie</b> must be quarantined and destroyed. [...] The experimental breeding involved selecting a group of Swaledale sheep with low suspectability to the disease, injecting them with the agents of the disease, and breeding from the survivors. [...] The research has concluded that the offspring of the infected sheep are more able to survive <b>scrapie.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Different {{hypotheses}} {{exist for}} the origin of prion proteins in cattle. Two leading hypotheses suggest it may have jumped species from the disease <b>scrapie</b> in sheep, or that it evolved from a spontaneous form of [...] "mad cow disease" [...] that has been seen occasionally in cattle for many centuries. In the 5th century BC, Hippocrates described a similar illness in cattle and sheep, which he believed also occurred in man. Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus recorded cases of a disease with similar characteristics in {{the fourth and fifth}} centuries AD. The British Government enquiry took the view the cause was not <b>scrapie,</b> as had originally been postulated, but was some event in the 1970s that was not possible to identify.|$|E
2500|$|Designated {{notifiable}} diseases {{under the}} Diseases of Animals Act include anthrax, foot-and-mouth disease, fowl pest, bovine tuberculosis, BSE, <b>scrapie,</b> swine vesicular disease, Aujeszky's disease, bovine leukemia virus, rabies and warble fly. [...] Under the Zoonoses Order conditions {{that can be}} transmitted to humans, such as brucellosis or salmonella, must also be notified.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cause of}} BSE may {{be from the}} {{contamination}} of MBM from sheep with <b>scrapie</b> that were processed in the same slaughterhouse. The epidemic was probably accelerated by the recycling of infected bovine tissues prior to the recognition of BSE. The origin of the disease itself remains unknown. The infectious agent is distinctive for the high temperatures at which it remains viable, over [...] A contributory factor was the feeding of infected protein supplements to very young calves.|$|E
2500|$|Disease {{of plants}} and animals can break an {{agricultural}} producer. [...] Tuberculosis in animals was an early threat, and cattle needed to be tested, and areas accredited in 1956. The newer disease such as chronic wasting disease or transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) affects both elk and deer. Elk and deer raising is a pioneer field of domestication, has had a setback with this disease. Mad cow disease in cattle [...] and <b>scrapie</b> of sheep are monitored by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. The poultry sector was plagued by Pullorum disease, and by controlling the flock via poultry husbandry, this disease has been brought under control.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, a {{team from}} New York {{described}} detection of PrPSc even when initially present at only one part in one hundred billion (10−11) in brain tissue. The method combines amplification with a novel technology called surround optical fiber immunoassay (SOFIA) and some specific antibodies against PrPSc. After amplifying and then concentrating any PrPSc, the samples are labelled with a fluorescent dye using an antibody for specificity and then finally loaded into a micro-capillary tube. This tube is placed in a specially constructed apparatus {{so that it is}} totally surrounded by optical fibres to capture all light emitted once the dye is excited using a laser. The technique allowed detection of PrPSc after many fewer cycles of conversion than others have achieved, substantially reducing the possibility of artefacts, as well as speeding up the assay. The researchers also tested their method on blood samples from apparently healthy sheep that went on to develop <b>scrapie.</b> The animals’ brains were analysed once any symptoms became apparent. The researchers could therefore compare results from brain tissue and blood taken once the animals exhibited symptoms of the diseases, with blood obtained earlier in the animals’ lives, and from uninfected animals.

50|$|The National <b>Scrapie</b> Plan aims {{to breed}} out these <b>scrapie</b> polymorphisms by {{increasing}} {{the frequency of the}} resistant allele. However, PrP-ARR polymorphisms are susceptible to atypical <b>scrapie,</b> so this may prove unfruitful.|$|E
50|$|In the United Kingdom, the {{government}} has {{put in place a}} National <b>Scrapie</b> Plan, which encourages breeding from sheep that are genetically more resistant to <b>scrapie.</b> This is intended to eventually reduce the incidence of the disease in the UK sheep population. <b>Scrapie</b> occurs in Europe and North America, but to date, Australia and New Zealand (both major sheep-producing countries) are scrapie-free.|$|E
50|$|<b>Scrapie</b> usually affects sheep {{around three}} to five years of age. The {{potential}} for transmission at birth and from contact with placental tissues is apparent. No evidence indicates <b>scrapie</b> is infectious to humans.|$|E
50|$|In 1971, Dickinson, AG and Meikle, VM {{provided}} a hypothesis for the replication of the <b>scrapie</b> agent. This hypothesis {{was based on}} the discovery of a single autosomal gene controlling the <b>scrapie</b> incubation period in mice and on observations about strains of the <b>scrapie</b> agent. They dubbed the gene sinc for <b>scrapie</b> incubator. This hypothesis proposed that the gene products of each sinc allele contributed to a multimeric protein structure, which then formed a 'replication site' for the <b>scrapie</b> agent. The replication of the agent would depend on how the particular strain interacted with the replication site and of what the site was composed. The fact that different strains of <b>scrapie</b> were known had suggested the agent was similar to conventional viruses in that it carried a genome composed of nucleic acids. Thus, variants could arise during incubation, giving rise to new strains. No host-encoded properties were found to determine <b>scrapie</b> agent strain differences. This was thought to prove that the genome of the agent could vary independently and, although replicated by normal host mechanisms, was not coded by the host. The term 'virino' was coined to reflect the small size, immunological neutrality, and virus-like nature of the infectious particles.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Scrapie</b> is a fatal, {{degenerative}} disease {{that affects the}} nervous systems of sheep and goats.
