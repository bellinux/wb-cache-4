This inference may be challengeable. Results (1) It is argued that "weak" <b>size</b> <b>control</b> implies {{the existence of a}} checkpoint, and unfortunately the technique used by Conlon and Raff might obscure such a weak mechanism. (2) Previous investigations of <b>size</b> <b>control</b> in yeasts have shown that individual cell data, rather than means and variances of cell populations, are prerequisites for reliable interpretation. (3) No experimental data so far obtained suggest that in any cell culture a linear growth pattern in cell mass can maintain size homeostasis on its own without <b>size</b> <b>control.</b> (4) Studies on fission yeast mutants indicate that the molecular mechanisms of <b>size</b> <b>control</b> vary with genetic background, implying that no single mechanism is likely to apply to any cell type, including cultured mammalian cells, under all conditions.

Size homeostasis requires that cells exert a tight <b>control</b> over the <b>size</b> at which they divide. Cell <b>size</b> <b>control</b> is not only robust against various noises, but also highly flexible since cell sizes can vary tremendously, notably {{as a function of}} nutrient levels. We formulated a minimal mathematical model of the eukaryotic cell cycle in which the cell <b>size</b> <b>control</b> operates through a cell growth-dependent bifurcation in the cell cycle dynamics. Such a bifurcation mechanism can readily explain the occurrence of a minimum critical size at division under limiting growth conditions. However, it also predicts that cells should become progressively larger and larger under prolific growth conditions. We argue that the cell <b>size</b> <b>control</b> can be reinforced at fast growth rates by adding a new cell cycle inhibitory activity whose strength would increase with the cell growth rate.

40|$|To {{maintain}} a constant cell size, dividing cells have to coordinate cell cycle events with cell growth.

In agreement with this hypothesis, the size at birth influences the time spent in G 1 : smaller cells have a longer G 1 period [3].

In bacteria, several recent {{studies have shown that the}} incremental model of <b>size</b> <b>control,</b> in which <b>size</b> is <b>controlled</b> by addition of a constant volume (in contrast to a size threshold), is able to quantitatively explain the experimental data on 4 different bacterial species [6, 5, 6, 7].

40|$|In Germany, the {{installed}} capacity {{of renewable energy}} sources, especially that of wind and photovoltaic energy, has increased {{over the past few}} years and will continue to increase in the future. Due to errors in forecasting wind and photovoltaic energy, the control reserve needed to balance the electricity system will correspondingly increase if control reserves will be sized statically for several months or one year as it is done in most countries today [1 - 3]. That is because <b>sizing</b> <b>control</b> reserves this way does not consider the fact that there will be hours with a high penetration of wind and photovoltaic which cause a different demand for control reserves than hours with a lower penetration. Therefore, in this work, we present a new probabilistic dynamic method that sizes control reserves for the single hours of the following day making use of forecasts of the power feed-in of wind and photovoltaic. In contrast to similar approaches [2, 3] forecast errors of wind and photovoltaic power are not modeled as normal distributions, which does not reflect reality [4 - 6], but by kernel density estimation to get more realistic distributions. Under a 100 % renewable energy scenario for Germany, the control reserve that would be allocated by the dynamic method is compared with the control reserve that would be allocated by a static method. The static method is similar to the probabilistic Graf-Haubrich method, which is applied in Germany today, but can, in contrast to this method, be applied to future scenarios.

In designing runoff management systems, accurately assessing the amount of runoff that will be generated is of foremost importance. Along with overall quantity of runoff, the temporal pattern, both throughout the year and within an individual storm event, can {{have important implications for}} <b>sizing</b> <b>control</b> system components, in determining the performance the control system achieves, and in the overall pollution potential of the feedlot. This review summarizes the hydraulic properties of the feedlot surface, specifically focusing on variables that impact the total volume of effluent generated and the resulting amount of sediment transported. The work cumulates in development of a feedlot runoff routing model, presented as a series of equations that are implemented within the updated Iowa State University-Vegetative Treatment Area model, with a sediment transport/erosion component. Overall, the results indicated that a curve number of 91 was best for estimating runoff volumes, but substantial variation about this value could occur. The calibrated model was able to accurately estimate average total solids concentrations of lots of different size, shape, and surface condition under different hydraulic situations (R 2 = 0. 92 for calibration and the slope of the measured vs. modeled data was not different than one during model validation). Most calibration and validation feedlots were earthen, had the majority of runoff from rainfall events, had mounds within the pen, and were scraped only once or twice per production cycle; thus model performance may be limited for other situations. The feedlot runoff and sediment routing components were used {{to assess the impact of}} various feedlot design characteristics, including feedlot area, aspect ratio, and slope, on solids transport from the feedlot surface. This model can be used to evaluate the risk that feedlot runoff poses to water quality for prioritizing feedlots that are in need of enhanced runoff control systems, and to evaluate the hydraulic and sediment loadings that a runoff control system is required to handle...|$|E

40|$|In budding yeast, {{asymmetric}} {{cell division}} yields a larger {{mother and a}} smaller daughter cell, which transcribe different genes due to the daughter-specific transcription factors Ace 2 and Ash 1. Cell <b>size</b> <b>control</b> at the Start checkpoint has long been {{considered to be a}} main regulator of the length of the G 1 phase of the cell cycle, resulting in longer G 1 in the smaller daughter cells. Our recent data confirmed this concept using quantitative time-lapse microscopy. However, it has been proposed that daughter-specific, Ace 2 -dependent repression of expression of the G 1 cyclin CLN 3 had a dominant role in delaying daughters in G 1. We wanted to reconcile these two divergent perspectives on the origin of long daughter G 1 times. We quantified <b>size</b> <b>control</b> using single-cell time-lapse imaging of fluorescently labeled budding yeast, in {{the presence or absence of}} the daughter-specific transcriptional regulators Ace 2 and Ash 1. Ace 2 and Ash 1 are not required for efficient <b>size</b> <b>control,</b> but they shift the domain of efficient <b>size</b> <b>control</b> to larger cell size, thus increasing cell size requirement for Start in daughters. Microarray and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments show that Ace 2 and Ash 1 are direct transcriptional regulators of the G 1 cyclin gene CLN 3. Quantification of cell <b>size</b> <b>control</b> in cells expressing titrated levels of Cln 3 from ectopic promoters, and from cells with mutated Ace 2 and Ash 1 sites in the CLN 3 promoter, showed that regulation of CLN 3 expression by Ace 2 and Ash 1 can account for the differential regulation of Start in response to cell size in mothers and daughters.

Instead, we show through single-cell microscopy and modeling that the evolutionarily distant bacteria Escherichia coli and Caulobacter crescentus achieve cell size homeostasis by growing, on average, the same amount between divisions, irrespective of cell length at birth. This simple mechanism provides a remarkably robust cell <b>size</b> <b>control</b> without the need of being precise, abating size deviations exponentially within a few generations. This size homeostasis mechanism is broadly applicable for symmetric and asymmetric divisions, as well as for different growth rates.

Recent single cell studies suggest that most bacteria follow an “adder” model of cell <b>size</b> <b>control,</b> incorporating a fixed amount of cell wall material before dividing.

40|$|Maintenance of {{cellular}} size {{is a fundamental}} systems level process that requires balancing of cell growth with proliferation. This is achieved via the cell division cycle, which {{is driven by the}} sequential accumulation and destruction of cyclins. The regulatory network around these cyclins, particularly in G 1, has been interpreted as a <b>size</b> <b>control</b> network in budding yeast, and cell size as being decisive for the START transition. However, it is not clear why disruptions in the G 1 network may lead to altered size rather than loss of <b>size</b> <b>control,</b> or why the S-G 2 -M duration also depends on nutrients. With a mathematical population model comprised of individually growing cells, we show that cyclin translation would suffice to explain the observed growth rate dependence of cell volume at START. Moreover, we assess the impact of the observed bud-localisation of the G 2 cyclin CLB 2 mRNA, and find that localised cyclin translation could provide an efficient mechanism for measuring the biosynthetic capacity in specific compartments: The mother in G 1, and the growing bud in G 2. Hence, iteration of the same principle can ensure that the mother cell is strong enough to grow a bud, and that the bud is strong enough for independent life. Cell sizes emerge in the model, which predicts that a single CDK-cyclin pair per growth phase suffices for <b>size</b> <b>control</b> in budding yeast, despite the necessity of the cell cycle network around the cyclins to integrate other cues. <b>Size</b> <b>control</b> seems to be exerted twice, where the G 2 /M <b>control</b> affects bud <b>size</b> through bud-localized translation of CLB 2 mRNA, explaining the dependence of the S-G 2 -M duration on nutrients.

The aberrant cell-size phenotypes caused by mutations in the retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor pathway are consistent with a role in <b>size</b> checkpoint <b>control,</b> but indirect effects on size caused by altered cell cycle kinetics are difficult to rule out. The multiple fission cell cycle of the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii uncouples growth from division, allowing direct assessment of the relationship between size phenotypes and checkpoint function. Mutations in the C. reinhardtii RB homolog encoded by MAT 3 cause supernumerous cell divisions and small cells, suggesting a role for MAT 3 in <b>size</b> <b>control.</b> We identified suppressors of an mat 3 null allele that had recessive mutations in DP 1 or dominant mutations in E 2 F 1, loci encoding homologs of a heterodimeric transcription factor that is targeted by RB-related proteins. Significantly, we determined that the dp 1 and e 2 f 1 phenotypes were caused by defects in <b>size</b> checkpoint <b>control</b> and were not due to a lengthened cell cycle. Despite their cell division defects, mat 3, dp 1, and e 2 f 1 mutants showed almost no changes in periodic transcription of genes induced during S phase and mitosis, many of which are conserved targets of the RB pathway.
