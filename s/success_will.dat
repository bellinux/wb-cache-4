25|$|The Flemish region, {{under its}} Brabantnet plan, intends {{to build a}} new line {{to the north of the}} city, from Heysel/Heizel to Willebroek {{alongside}} the A12 road. Its <b>success</b> <b>will</b> require integration with the existing Brussels regional system; for instance the line will have to be built at standard rather than metre gauge (as the other Flemish trams are).|$|E
25|$|For {{any given}} finite problem, the {{probability}} that the simulated annealing algorithm terminates with a global optimal solution approaches 1 as the annealing schedule is extended. This theoretical result, however, is not particularly helpful, since the time required to ensure a significant probability of <b>success</b> <b>will</b> usually exceed the time required for a complete search of the solution space.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{is common}} to confuse Bateman's ideas with those of later scientists, his {{principle}} can be expressed in three simple statements. The first is that male reproductive success increases with the number of mates they attempt to copulate with, while female reproductive success does not. The second is that male reproductive <b>success</b> <b>will</b> show greater variance than female. The third is that sexual selection will have a greater effect on the sex with greater variance in reproductive success.|$|E

25|$|C. rufifacies is {{of primary}} {{forensic}} {{importance in the}} field of medicocriminal entomology and aids in establishing post mortem intervals. The species will become more significant ecologically, medically, and forensically as it displaces other native species and becomes a dominant blow fly. Future research is directed toward examining the potential effects of the widespread distribution of this species. C. rufifacies competes with the native Cochliomyia macellaria species and may cause the latter to become extinct. The fly has been successful in competing with other species in many regions of the world. This newly achieved <b>success</b> <b>will</b> require close monitoring of the species to examine its ecological effects and determine any serious involvement in myiasis. Further research in the developmental and successional behavior of the species will allow for more accurate post mortem interval calculations {{in the field of}} medicocriminal entomology.|$|E
25|$|In {{his book}} Soul snatchers: the {{mechanics}} of cults, Jean-Marie Abgrall describes how Altered States Of Consciousness (ASCs) are used in many cults to make the initiate more susceptible to the group will and world view. He cites research by Barmark and Gautnitz which showed {{the similarities between the}} states obtained by Transcendental Meditation and ASCs. In this way, not only does the subject become more reliant on the ASC, but it allows for a weakening of criticism of the cult and increase in faith therein. Abgrall goes on to note that the use of mantras {{is one of the most}} widespread techniques in cults, noting in TM this mantra is produced mentally. He says that a guru is usually central to a cult and that its <b>success</b> <b>will</b> rely on how effective that guru is. Among the common characteristics of a guru he notes paraphrenia, a mental illness that completely cuts the individual from reality. In regard to this he notes for example, that the Maharishi recommended the TM-Sidhi program including 'yogic flying' as a way to reduce crime.|$|E
25|$|Embryo {{collection}} is more demanding and requires more training than semen collection because the female reproductive organs are located {{inside of the}} body cavity. Superovulation is a technique used {{in order to have}} a female release more oocytes than normal. This can be achieved by using hormones to manipulate the female's reproductive organs. The hormones used are typically gonadotropin-like, meaning they stimulate the gonads. Follicle stimulating hormone is the preferred hormone in cattle, sheep and goats. While in pigs, equine chorionic gonadotropin is preferred. However, this is not commonly done in the swine industry because gilts and sows (female pigs) naturally ovulate more than one oocyte at one time. Superovulation can be difficult because not all females will respond the same way and <b>success</b> <b>will</b> vary by species. Once the female has released the oocytes, they are fertilized internally—in vivo—and flushed out of her body. In vivo fertilization is more successful than in vitro fertilization. In cattle, usually 10 or more embryos are removed from the flushing process. In order to flush the uterus, a technician will first seal off the female's cervix and add fluid, which allows the ovum to be flushed out of the uterine horns and into a cylinder for analysis. This process typically takes 30 minutes or less. Technicians are able to determine the sex of the embryo, which can be especially beneficial in the dairy industry because it is more desirable for the embryo to be a female. Vitrification is the preferred method of embryo freezing because it yields higher quality embryos. It is crucial technicians handle the embryos with care and freeze them within 3–4 hours in order to preserve viability of the greatest percentage of embryos.|$|E

500|$|In 1878 and 1879 Stanford {{worked on}} his first opera, The Veiled Prophet, to a {{libretto}} by his friend William Barclay Squire. It {{was based on a}} poem by Thomas Moore with characters including a virgin priestess and a mystic prophet, and a plot that culminates in poisoning and stabbing. Stanford offered the work to the opera impresario Carl Rosa, who refused it and suggested that the composer should try to have it staged in Germany: [...] "Its <b>success</b> <b>will</b> (unfortunately) have much greater chances here if accepted abroad." [...] Referring to the enormous popularity of Sullivan's comic operas, Rosa added, [...] "If the work was of the Pinafore style it would be quite another matter." [...] Stanford had greatly enjoyed Sullivan's Cox and Box, but The Veiled Prophet was intended to be a serious work of high drama and romance.|$|E
500|$|Markham {{had agreed}} to Shackleton's {{appointment}} as Third Officer on the Discovery following a recommendation from the expedition's principal private donor. He had given sympathy and support after Shackleton's early return from the expedition on grounds of ill health, and had backed the latter's unsuccessful application for a Royal Navy commission. Later, after Shackleton had confided his intention to lead an expedition of his own, Markham supplied a generous testimonial, describing Shackleton as [...] "well-fitted to have charge of men in an enterprise involving hardship and peril", and [...] "admirably fitted for {{the leader of a}} Polar Expedition." [...] He expressed strong support for Shackleton's 1907–09 Nimrod Expedition: [...] "... not only my most cordial wishes for your <b>success</b> <b>will</b> accompany you, but also a well-founded hope."
