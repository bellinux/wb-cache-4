50|$|The {{fossils of}} Kenyanthropus platyops {{indicate}} that hominins were more taxonomically diverse {{during the middle}} Pliocene. The discovery of this fossil also dated non forward-projecting jaws further back than previous discoveries. The facial structure of the Kenyanthropus and its derived features were very different of that of the Paranthropus, including almost every cranial feature. This gave no reason to assign the new skull in the genus Paranthropus, unless it could somehow be linked to be a previous version of the Paranthropus. It is still thought that the differences in cranial structure are too different for even {{that to be a}} possibility. The Kenyanthropus also shows many differences to Homo, as well as Ardipithecus, which leaves only the Australopithecus. The cranial structure of the Kenyanthropus has a few similarities to the Australopithecus, such as brain <b>size,</b> <b>parts</b> of the nasal, the suborbital and the temporal regions, but the differences far outweigh the similarities leading to its new genus.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Cutting-bill requirements, {{among other}} factors, {{influence}} the yield obtained when cutting lumber into parts. The {{first part of}} this 2 -part series described how different cutting-bill <b>part</b> <b>sizes,</b> when added to an existing cutting-bill, affect lumber yield, and quantified these observations. To accomplish this, the study employed linear least squares estimation technique. This second paper again looks at the influence of cutting-bill requirements but establishes a measure of how preferable it is to have a given <b>part</b> <b>size</b> required by the cutting-bill. The influence of the number of different <b>part</b> <b>sizes</b> to be cut simulta-neously on lumber yield is also investigated. Using rip-first rough mill simulation software and an orthogonal, 220 – 11 fractional-factorial design of resolution V, the correlation between lengths, widths, and 20 <b>part</b> <b>sizes</b> as defined by the Buehlmann cutting-bill with high yield was established. It was found that, as long as the quantity of small parts is limited, <b>part</b> <b>sizes</b> larger than the smallest size are more positively correlated with high yield. Furthermore, only 4 out of the 20 <b>part</b> <b>sizes</b> tested were identified with having a significant positive correlation with above average yield (65. 09 %), while 10 were found with a significant negative correlation and above average yield. With respect to the benefit of cutting varying numbers of <b>part</b> <b>sizes</b> simultaneously, this study showed that there is a positive correlation between yield and the number of different <b>part</b> <b>sizes</b> being cut. However, Duncan’s test did not detect significant yield gains for instances when more than 11 <b>part</b> <b>sizes</b> are contained in the cutting-bill...|$|R

40|$|A {{group of}} {{identical}} NC machines, {{laid out in}} a line, manufactures relatively few part types in large batch <b>size.</b> <b>Parts</b> of the same type are processed by the machines simultaneously. The operations on a part are performed by one machine only, using a part type specific tool set. During batch production the tool magazines of the machines contain the same set of tools. If the machine group is provided with an automatic tool transport system then tools can be shared. Therefore, the number of identical tools can be reduced and savings with respect to investment in tools are possible. A disadvantage of tool sharing is that machines might become idle because tools have not arrived in time. Suitable dispatching and scheduling of the tool transportation device can reduce these machine waiting times. In this paper the characteristics of the production situation are examined. The consequences of three tool transport policies with respect to transport time and transport frequency of the transportation device are analyzed. Analytical results are presented and some extensions are discussed. The method presented provides a way to analyze transport rules in this type of systems...|$|E

Modern equipment for laser cladding enables material to be deposited with a lateral resolution of about 100 μm and to produce high precision surface coating on small <b>size</b> <b>parts.</b> In this paper laser micro cladding process was investigated to produce wear protective coatings on Al-based alloy surface. Al-matrix composite (AlSi 30) surface layers with thickness in the range 15 - 600 μm were formed on AlMgSi 0, 5 alloy surface by laser micro cladding. The influence of laser cladding parameters (powder mass flow, vertical increment etc.) and layers number on quality of the deposited coatings was investigated. The homogeneous and free of pores and cracks coating microstructure was produced. The influence of the laser cladding parameters and layers number on functional characteristics of the deposited coatings (e. g. hardness, abrasive wear resistance and electrical conductivity) was investigated. It was found that hardness and wear resistance of the coatings increased with the decrease of powder mass flow.

30|$|The network {{generation}} {{procedure was}} implemented in ABAQUS finite element software using Python scripting. In this way, we can combine {{finite element model}} making and simulations with useful numerical tools. In the initial intersection testing and {{in the search for}} fiber-to-fiber contact Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi (GJK) collision detection algorithm [34] of convex objects is utilized. For a non-convex object, the same GJK algorithm can be used to detect the collision of the convex hulls of the objects. In the contact searching, bounding volume hierarchies and hierarchy traversal collision testing are used. In a bounding volume hierarchy, a geometric object is partitioned into a tree structure. The bounding volume hierarchy of a fiber is constructed using convex hulls. The root node is the convex hull of the fiber. At each node, the fiber part is subdivided into two nearly equal <b>size</b> <b>parts</b> and the convex hulls of the parts are stored in the child nodes. This procedure is continued until we end up in a structure in which the leaf nodes contain the convex hull of a single element. The fiber-to-fiber intersection tests are conducted using their bounding volume hierarchies. In the intersection tests, both hierarchies are descended simultaneously using a depth-first approach [35]. After all contacts have been found, the network connectedness is studied using the breadth-first search (BFS) strategy.|$|E
40|$|The {{anisotropy}} of composite plates often poses {{difficulties for}} stress field {{analysis in the}} presence of notches. The most common methods for these analyses are: (i) analytical means (AM), (ii) finite element analysis (FEA), and (iii) semi-analytical means (SAM). In industry, FEA has been especially popular for the determination of stresses in small to medium <b>size</b> <b>parts</b> but can require a considerable amount of computing power and time. For faster analyses, one can use AM. The available solutions for a given problem, however, can be quite limited. Additionally, AM implemented in commercial computer software are scarce and difficult to find. Due to this, these methods are not widespread and SAM were proposed. SAM combine the (easy) implementation of complex problems from FEA and the computational efficiency from AM to reduce the difficulty on mathematical operation and increase computational speed with respect to FEA. AM, however, are still the fastest and most accurate way to determine the stress field in a given problem. Complex problems, however, e. g., finite width plates with multiple loaded/unloaded notches, require a significant amount of mathematical involvement which quickly discourages, even seasoned, scientists, and engineers. To encourage the use of AM, this paper gives a brief review of the mathematical basis of AM followed by a historic perspective on the expansions originating from this mathematical basis.

40|$|The {{most common}} type of Computed Tomography (CT) system {{deployed}} in the automotive industry for inspection of aluminum castings today uses a 450 kV x-ray source. These systems are quite suitable for inspection of cylinder heads, transmission cases and other medium <b>size</b> <b>parts</b> with little or no embedded steel or other dense metals. As a general rule, parts with maximum path lengths of 264 mm in aluminum or 82 mm in steel can be successfully inspected at 450 kV. Achieving excellent image quality on larger parts with longer path lengths such as engine blocks with steel liners normally requires the use of a linear accelerator producing x-rays at 2 MV or higher. Such installations are not common at industrial sites due to high cost, large size, and operational safety considerations. Recent developments in mathematical processing algorithms for correction of CT data have facilitated the imaging of larger aluminum parts with long path lengths and embedded heavy metals. Prior to these new corrections, the results from 450 kV systems were unsatisfactory due to distortion, noise, and artifacts in the images. We present “before ” and “after ” images showing the improvements gained from these additional processing steps. Three specific correction methods are presented: global noise filtering, adaptive noise filtering, and ring artifact suppression applied to raw data. The physical basis of each correction is discussed along with the mathematical theory. A new version of software incorporating these additional correction steps has been issued to existing 450 kV systems, enabling them to expand their scope of applications beyond the original specifications and design goals...|$|E
