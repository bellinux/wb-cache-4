40|$|Protecting quantum {{information}} from decoherence due to environmental noise {{is vital for}} fault-tolerant quantum computation. To this end, standard quantum error correction employs parallel projective measurements of individual particles, which makes the system extremely complicated. Here we propose measurement-free topological protection in two dimension without any <b>selective</b> <b>addressing</b> of individual particles. We make use of engineered dissipative dynamics and feedback operations to reduce the entropy generated by decoherence {{in such a way}} that quantum information is topologically protected. We calculate an error threshold, below which quantum information is protected, without assuming <b>selective</b> <b>addressing,</b> projective measurements, nor instantaneous classical processing. All physical operations are local and translationally invariant, and no parallel projective measurement is required, which implies high scalability. Furthermore, since the engineered dissipative dynamics we utilized has been well studied in quantum simulation, the proposed scheme can be a promising route progressing from quantum simulation to fault-tolerant quantum information processing.

40|$|Increasing the {{locality}} of {{a memory}} access profile {{is an interesting}} optimization problem, whose solution has implications on both performance and energy consumption of a processor-based system. High-locality memory access patterns are normally obtained through software-driven transformations, applied either at the source-code level or during compilation and machine-code generation. For some specific classes of systems, e. g., embedded systems, hardware-oriented, on-the-fly access pattern modification is also an option, as it trades generality in the applicability for better performance. This paper presents a class of algorithms for improving the locality of a given memory access profile through <b>selective</b> <b>address</b> relocation that require a very low-overhead custom hardware unit.

The heterogeneity, multi-interfaces, extreme resource constrains and minia-turization of the nodes participating in multiple networks affects the autoconfiguration schemes.

By allowing nodes to activate their main transceiver only when data need to be trans-mitted or received, wake-up-enabled solutions virtually {{eliminate the need for}} idle listening, thus drastically reducing the energy toll of communication.
