5|$|After an April 21, 1995, {{court hearing}} on the gun charges, but before McVeigh's release, federal agents took him into custody as they {{continued}} their investigation into the bombing. Rather than talk to investigators about the bombing, McVeigh demanded an attorney. Having been tipped off {{by the arrival of}} police and helicopters that a bombing <b>suspect</b> <b>was</b> inside, a restless crowd began to gather outside the jail. While McVeigh's requests for a bulletproof vest or transport by helicopter were denied, authorities did use a helicopter to transport him from Perry to Oklahoma City.|$|E
5|$|Beauchamp {{arrived in}} Frankfort on November 15, 1825. New Court partisans talked of Sharp's murder {{as the work}} of the Old Court party, just as Beauchamp had hoped. One <b>suspect</b> <b>was</b> Waring, who had printed the handbills {{critical}} of Sharp. Known as a violent man, he had both political and personal motivation for the crime. He was cleared of suspicion when investigators learned that, {{at the time of the}} murder, Waring was in Fayette County recovering from unrelated injuries.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 28 April 2012, Martínez Pérez was murdered inside her home in Xalapa after being {{severely}} beaten. A <b>suspect</b> <b>was</b> arrested in October 2012 and publicly confessed to the murder, while the Mexican authorities concluded that the motive of the murder was theft. But the suspect later retracted his confession and stated that he had been tortured and threatened by officials to lie and admit to the murder. Investigators have relied solely on the suspect's confession to incriminate him; the DNA and fingerprint samples collected at the murder scene did not match the suspect's according to sources close to Committee to Protect Journalists.|$|E

40|$|Most of time, the <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> presumed {{innocent}} in {{the beginning}} of the penal proceeding. But this presumption of innocence is created for saving individual freedoms and reputation. The truth <b>is</b> that the <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> presumed guilty after his arrest. And the judicial authorities will check if the <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> innocent or confirmed guilty. This situation can threaten individual freedoms and reputation. That is why we want to size the meaning of presumption of innocence in other to protect it, at first. Secondly, we are going to study the presumption of culpability. What is more, the fact that the <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> presumed guilty justifies the office of a barrister at any stage of the penal proceeding. In fact, before the arrest of the <b>suspect,</b> he <b>is</b> presumed innocent. After his arrest he is presumed guilty...|$|R
5|$|In 1943, {{a special}} {{branch of the}} Kempeitai under Lieutenant Colonel Haruzo Sumida was charged with finding the culprits {{responsible}} for acts of sabotage in Singapore, mainly the cutting of telephone lines and the burning of warehouses. Sumida strongly suspected that the saboteurs were being organised by internees in Changi Prison, and made preparations for a raid on the prison to catch the ringleaders. Sumida's chief <b>suspect</b> <b>was</b> British barrister Rob Heeley Scott, a prominent Foreign Office employee who had previously been detained for his anti-Japanese propaganda, released by the Kempeitai, and then later sent to Changi Prison.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, chief agent John Douglas, {{working with}} {{agents in the}} FBI's Behavioral Sciences Unit, issued a {{psychological}} profile of the unidentified bomber which described the offender as a man with above-average intelligence with connections to academia. This profile was later refined to characterize the offender as a neo-Luddite holding an academic degree in the hard sciences, but this psychologically based profile was discarded in 1983 {{in favor of an}} alternative theory developed by FBI analysts concentrating on the physical evidence in recovered bomb fragments. In this rival profile, the bomber <b>suspect</b> <b>was</b> characterized as a blue-collar airplane mechanic. A 1-800 hotline was set up by the UNABOM Task Force to take any calls related to the Unabomber investigation, with a $1million reward for anyone who could provide information leading to the Unabomber's capture.|$|E
5|$|In the 21st century, {{property}} {{and real estate}} development in the city has boomed, with {{a dramatic increase in}} new hotels and shopping centres, fuelled by the policies of Mohammed VI of Morocco, who aims {{to increase the number of}} tourists annually visiting Morocco to 20 million by 2020. In 2010, a major gas explosion occurred in the city. On 28 April 2011, a bomb attack took place in the Jemaa el-Fnaa square, killing 15 people, mainly foreigners. The blast destroyed the nearby Argana Cafe. Police sources arrested three suspects and claimed the chief <b>suspect</b> <b>was</b> loyal to Al-Qaeda, although Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb denied involvement. On November 2016 the city hosted the 2016 United Nations Climate Change Conference.|$|E
25|$|On 23 August, {{two more}} <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> {{detained}} {{on suspicion of}} preparing to commit crimes with terrorist intent.

A total of 922 counts of indictment were laid {{as a result of}} this IMET criminal investigation.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{interpretation}} of the title is that it refers to Rawls's demand that Santangelo close at least one case; for a homicide case to be considered [...] "closed" [...] only requires that a <b>suspect</b> <b>be</b> arrested and charged. After the <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> charged, the murder is considered closed/solved even if the <b>suspect</b> <b>is</b> not convicted; this is why, earlier in the season, Rawls pushes for arrests on murders {{in order to help}} the statistics, even though the cases are weak.|$|R
5|$|Monica Reyes {{was born}} and raised in Mexico City, Mexico, and speaks fluent Spanish. She studied {{folklore}} and mythology at Brown University, and has a master's degree in Religious Studies. In 1990, Reyes enrolled in the Federal Bureau of Investigation at Quantico, Virginia. Her first assignment in the FBI was serving on a special taskforce investigating Satanic ritual abuse. Reyes then served in the New York City field office, where she became romantically involved with special agent Brad Follmer despite the FBI's strict anti-fraternization rules. Reyes was the head investigator in the kidnapping of 7 year-old Luke Doggett, son of then NYPD officer John Doggett. The boy was eventually found dead, but no <b>suspect</b> <b>was</b> ever apprehended. In 1999, Monica Reyes transferred to the New Orleans field office.|$|E
5|$|On 12 January 1996, {{investigators}} {{announced that}} they would perform DNA testing on the drivers of all vehicles similar to the Mercedes. This {{was the first time}} the method was used nationally to identify a murder suspect. Detectives traced more than 1,000 vehicles and tested 5,000 drivers. On 19 February, West Mercia Police confirmed that a man had been arrested and was helping them with their inquiries. The following day, authorities announced that the <b>suspect</b> <b>was</b> English and had been arrested in Poole, Dorset in a joint operation between West Mercia and Dorset Police. He was subsequently identified as Stuart Morgan, a 36-year-old self-employed lorry driver, who on 21 February was remanded following an appearance at Redditch magistrates.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 January, the Avon and Somerset Constabulary arrested 32-year-old Dutch {{engineer}} Vincent Tabak, who lived with his girlfriend in the flat next door to Yeates. However, authorities declined to reveal additional details while the <b>suspect</b> <b>was</b> being interrogated due to concerns over controversial media coverage of Jefferies' arrest, which had breached the rules governing what can be reported when an individual is arrested. The Tabak arrest followed an anonymous tip from a female caller, shortly after a televised appeal by Yeates' parents on Crimewatch. Canynge Road was closed by police while scaffolding was constructed around Yeates' home; and officers sealed off Tabak's adjacent flat. Investigators also searched the nearby townhouse of a friend, where Tabak was {{believed to have been}} staying, about a mile away. Tabak had previously been ruled out as a suspect during an earlier stage of the investigation, and had returned to Britain from a holiday visit to his family in the Netherlands.|$|E
50|$|Samples {{collected}} by the Isle of Man Constabulary's Scientific Support Department from crime scenes are sent to the UK for testing against the database.

50|$|The 2007 {{international}} {{child pornography}} investigation was an international criminal investigation into a criminal organization dealing in child pornography. Austrian authorities initiated the investigation in July {{and were the}} ones to uncover the criminal organization. More than 2360 suspects residing in 77 countries were investigated. Approximately 600 of the <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> in the United States. The European country with the most <b>suspects</b> <b>was</b> Germany. 130 of the <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> in Australia. The two suspects in the Republic of Ireland were not investigated by Garda Síochána until six months after Austrian authorities notified them of the crime. At least 23 <b>suspects</b> <b>were</b> Austrians. The pornography depicted the sexual abuse of {{children under the age}} of 14. A Russian website hosted the pornography on an Austrian server.|$|R
5|$|The {{investigation}} into the fire was led by the Division of Forestry's chief investigator, Sam Butcher. The investigation lasted four months, and once a suspect had been identified, the case {{was turned over to}} the Webster County prosecuting attorney's office. Butcher credited Art Yagel, a Division of Forestry investigator, for bringing the investigation to its conclusion. In January 2008, a 17-year-old suspect from Bergoo was formally charged with a felony count of arson for setting fire to the tree, while a second juvenile was also charged with a misdemeanor for providing false information to investigators. The <b>suspect</b> <b>was</b> also charged with misdemeanor counts of providing false information to conservation officers, possession of marijuana, and underage consumption of alcohol. The second juvenile was not involved in the setting of the fire.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Duke Marshall, {{a nephew}} of Chief Justice John Marshall and former {{resident}} of Washington County, Kentucky, {{was living in}} San Felipe. He noticed that the man called John Parker bore a strong resemblance to the Desha family of Kentucky and that he breathed through a silver tube like the one used by Isaac Desha. Marshall arrested Desha. After another former Kentuckian in the area also said he believed the <b>suspect</b> <b>was</b> Isaac Desha, Desha admitted his identity and confessed to murdering Early. He said he had intended to rob the Americans who had traveled with him from San Antonio, but the Mexican had watched him too closely. Although there was no jail in the town, a local blacksmith was commissioned to construct irons to restrain Desha until his trial.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court {{extended}} the standard from Berghuis v. Thompkins in Salinas v. Texas, 570 U.S. ___ (2013), on June 17, 2013, holding that a suspect's silence {{in response to}} a specific question posed during an interview with police when the <b>suspect</b> <b>was</b> not in custody and the suspect had been voluntarily answering other questions during that interview could be used against him in court where he did not explicitly invoke his Fifth Amendment right to silence in response to the specific question. Of the five justices who concluded that the suspect's silence could be used against him in these circumstances, Justices Alito, Roberts and Kennedy concluded that the defendant's Fifth Amendment claim failed because he did not expressly invoke the privilege. The other two Justices, Thomas and Scalia, concluded that the defendant's claim would fail even if he had invoked the privilege, on the theory that the prosecutor's comment at the trial—regarding the defendant's silence {{in response to a}} question during the police interview—did not compel the defendant to give self-incriminating testimony.|$|E
