If the male stands his ground and she does not run away or repeat the propulsive display, he approaches and, if she is mature, they copulate, the male inserting the tip {{of one of his}} palpal bulbs into the female's copulatory opening, using the first palp that made <b>scraping</b> <b>contact.</b> If the female is sub-adult (one moult from maturity), a male or sometimes a sub-adult male of P. fimbriata may cohabit in the female's capture web. Portia species usually mate on a web or on a dragline made by the female. P. fimbriata typically copulates for about 100seconds, while other genera can take several minutes or even several hours.

60|$|In life, {{the visible}} {{surface of the}} Sperm Whale is not the least among the many marvels he presents. Almost {{invariably}} it is all over obliquely crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in thick array, something {{like those in the}} finest Italian line engravings. But these marks {{do not seem to be}} impressed upon the isinglass substance above mentioned, but seem to be seen through it, as if they were engraved upon the body itself. Nor is this all. In some instances, to the quick, observant eye, those linear marks, as in a veritable engraving, but afford the ground for far other delineations. These are hieroglyphical; that is, if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics, then that is the proper word to use in the present connexion. By my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular, I was much struck with a plate representing the old Indian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the Upper Mississippi. Like those mystic rocks, too, the mystic-marked whale remains undecipherable. This allusion to the Indian rocks reminds me of another thing. Besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the Sperm Whale presents, he not seldom displays the back, and more especially his flanks, effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance, by reason of numerous rude scratches, altogether of an irregular, random aspect. I should say that those New England rocks on the seacoast, which Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent <b>scraping</b> <b>contact</b> with vast floating icebergs--I should say, that those rocks must not a little resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular. It also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact with other whales; for I have most remarked them in the large, full-grown bulls of the species.|$|E

This off-center strain can lead to bending of the rod in extreme cases, but more commonly causes leaking due to warping the circular seals into an oval shape. It can also damage and enlarge the bore hole around the rod and the inner cylinder wall around the piston head, if the rod is pressed hard enough sideways to fully compress and deform the seals to make metal-on-metal <b>scraping</b> <b>contact.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} partial 18 S ribosomal DNA (Rns) {{sequences of}} Acanthamoeba isolates cultured {{in a study}} of microbial keratitis in Hong Kong. Sequence differences were sufficient to distinguish closely related strains and were used to examine links between strains obtained from corneal <b>scrape</b> specimens, <b>contact</b> lenses, lens cases, lens case solutions, and home water-supply faucets of patients with Acanthamoeba. We also looked for evidence of mixed infections. Identification of Acanthamoeba Rns genotypes was based on sequences of ∼ 113 bp within the genus-specific amplicon ASA. S 1. This permitted genotype identification by using nonaxenic cultures. Of 13 specimens obtained from corneal <b>scrapes,</b> <b>contact</b> lenses, lens cases, or lens case solutions, 12 were Rns genotype T 4 and the remaining one was Rns genotype T 3. The sequences of corneal scrape specimens of two patients also were the same as those obtained from their contact lenses or lens case specimens. A possible triple-strain infection was indicated by three different T 4 sequences in cultures from one patient's lenses. Although faucet water used by patients to clean their lenses is a possible source of infections, specimens isolated from the faucets at two Acanthamoeba keratitis patients' homes differed from their corneal scrape or lens specimens. The overall results demonstrate the potential of this Rns region for tracking Acanthamoeba keratitis strains in infections and for distinguishing single-strain and closely related multiple-strain infections even when other microorganisms might be present with the cultured specimens. They also confirm the predominance of Rns genotype T 4 strains in Acanthamoeba keratitis infections...|$|R

Among the risk factors identified were foreign body on cornea, trauma, contact lens, vernal keratoconjunctivitis and surgical complication. The nature of this disease which was severe and slow healing caused prolonged hospital admission. Identification of causative microorganism by corneal scraping help in the treatment and management of this condition.

The {{content of a}} page may be parsed, searched, reformatted, its data copied into a spreadsheet, and so on.

40|$|Introduction. In recent years, {{the number}} of contact lens wearers has {{dramatically}} increased in Iran, particularly in youngsters. The purpose of current study {{was to assess the}} clinical presentation and antibiotic susceptibility of contact lens related microbial keratitis in Ahvaz, southwest of Iran. Methodology. A cross-sectional investigation of 26 patients (33 eyes) with contact lens induced corneal ulcers who were admitted to Imam Khomeini Hospital, Ahwaz City, from June 2012 to June 2013 was done. In order to study microbial culture and susceptibility of corneal ulcers, all of them were scraped. Results. Eight samples were reported as sterile. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (80 %) in positive cultures was the most widely recognized causative organism isolated. This is followed by Staphylococcus aureus 12 % and Enterobacter 8 %. The results showed that 84 % of the microorganism cases were sensitive to ciprofloxacin, while imipenem, meropenem, and ceftazidime were the second most effective antibiotics (76 %). Conclusion. Results of current study show the importance of referring all contact lens wearers with suspected corneal infection to ophthalmologists for more cure. The corneal <b>scraping</b> culture and <b>contact</b> lens solution should be performed to guide antibiotic therapy...|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{developed}} for the numerical simulation of plasma disruptions in tokamak fusion devices. The simulation of {{the second phase of}} the disruption, namely the current quench, allows for the first time a realistic analysis of the loads in the structure caused by disruptions. Up to now, the plasma behavior was prescribed in the input of codes used to analyse the structural loads. Because of the fact that the time dependend behavior of the disruption strongly depends on the electrical properties of the surrounding structure, the computational method has to take into account these mutual coupling effects of plasma and structure. To solve this problem, a dynamic plasma model was developed. This model has been integrated in the three dimensional finite element eddy-current code CARIDDI. Therefore, the new method finds a niche between codes that are developed to simulate only the plasma in great detail, and the currently used eddy current codes, where the plasma behavior is given as an input. The plasma is represented by reduced magnetohydrodynamic equations. The equations of electrodynamics and of plasma movement are solved separately in time. For the electrodynamics, a finite element approach has been developed that easily allows the inductive coupling of the two dimensional plasma and the three dimensional structure. The vertical movement of the plasma is solved by a rigid body approach, in which the accelerating forces on the plasma are linearized around the equilibrium. For the prescription of the free plasma-vacuum interface, a ''Volume-Of-Fluid'' method was applied. This method allows a fast and exact detection of the moving plasma boundary during disruption. To simulate the plasma <b>scraping</b> off when <b>contacting</b> the first wall, a special model has been developed. Due to methodical limits, only the toroidal component of the halo current can be considered. However, the poloidal component has been taken into account using an empirical approach. (orig.) 140 refs.
