40|$|In Bogor-West Java, <b>corm</b> rot <b>disease</b> of taro has devastated in many {{cropping}} {{areas and}} caused yield losses up to 70 %. During preliminary studies, Fusarium species were constantly recovered when diseased materials, rotten corms and discolored petioles were incubated. The objectives {{of this study}} was to identify the Fusarium species associated with the <b>corm</b> rot <b>disease</b> in Bogor and determine their pathogenicity and hosts range. Samples were collected from 40 diseased corm samples taken in 9 sub-districts of Bogor. Two species, viz, Fusarium solani and F. oxysporum were identified based on the morphological characteristics. Among 40 Fusarium isolates recovered in this study, 70 % were Fusarium solani and 30 % were F. oxysporum. F. solani could infect to all tested edible Araceae, while F. oxysporum was only pathogenic to Colocasia esculenta. Both species of Fusarium did not cause any symptoms when inoculated on selected ornamental and legume crops. These results gave the indication that F. solani was probably pathogenic only to edible Araceae, but further inoculation assay on living taro plants are necessary to carry out in order to clarify this result...|$|R
40|$|Effects {{of seven}} {{different}} corm lifting dates viz. 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105 and 120 days after flowering (DAF) were investigated {{to determine the}} optimum time of corm lifting in gladiolus. Different treatments had no {{significant effect on the}} number of corms and cormels per plant but individual corm weight, diameter of corm and weight of cormels per plant were significantly influenced by different treatments. These parameters were found to increase with increase in lifting dates except the treatment 120 DAF in case of weight of cormels per plant. When the corms were stored at normal room temperature, different treatments showed insignificant variation in the incidence of <b>corm</b> rot <b>disease.</b> <b>Corms</b> lifted at 30 DAF though showed higher percentage of weight loss and less reduction in diameter during storage, it did not differ significantly with other treatments in the productivity of gladiolus when planted in the following year...|$|R
40|$|Two {{new methods}} of {{propagating}} plantain and banana have been developed by the National Horticultural Research Institute in Nigeria. Both plantains and bananas are a major food in West Africa, but availability of propagating material has limited the expansion of groves 90 % of which are owned by peasant farmers. Lack of planting material and risk of disease transfer also pose problems for on-farm multiplication. The new methods use materials {{that would have been}} left to waste on the field and also ensure that true-to-type planting materials are used. In the first technique, the <b>split</b> <b>corm</b> technique (SCT), corms are cut into sett sizes of 50 g each and treated with fungicide. They are then air-dried for 24 hours before being planted in a 1 : 1 mix of forest topsoil and sterilized sawdust. New sprouts appear after four weeks from the date of planting and up to 20 plants have been obtained from one corm in this way. The second method is the Split Bud Technique (SBT) and is a modification of SCT. When the corn setts begin to sprout they are removed-from the nursery bed and split longitudinally into 4 sections. Using this method, up to 500 plants can be obtained from a single corm within 24 weeks. These methods will greatly increase the supply of banana and plantain propagating material, especially as the methods are not complicated and require no specialized equipment.

40|$|The {{association}} between the burrowing nematode Radopholus similis and giant swamp taro is studied in detail {{for the first time}} in corms collected from swampy taro patches in Yap, one of the states of the Federated States of Micronesia. The R. similis population from Yap displays similar variation in morphometrics and morphology as reported in the literature. The rot caused by the nematodes is wet with a loose mass of brown dead tissues and a deep brown necrotic centre housing nematodes inside. Usually, the infected tissues spread a disgusting odour typical of this disease. The dead tissues progress into shallow to deep cavities that advance towards the edible, central portion of the corm giving a perforated appearance on the outside of the otherwise smooth <b>corm.</b> The <b>disease</b> becomes more severe as the age of the plant increases. Nematode-infected plants seldom show any above-ground symptoms. The market quality of the corm is greatly reduced by the nematode damage. The widespread occurrence of the disease and the type of damage R. similis causes to the corms pose a serious threat to giant swamp taro production, food security and the continuation of traditional customs on those islands where R. similis occurs. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) {{has always}} been recognised as a toxic gas, due to its higher affinity for haemoglobin than oxygen. However, biological studies have revealed an intriguing role for CO as an endogenous signalling molecule, a gasotransmitter. CO is demonstrated to exert many cellular activities including anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic, and antiproliferative activities. In animal studies, CO gas administration can prevent tissues from hypoxia or ischemic-reperfusion injury. As a result, there are a plethora of reports dealing with the biological applications of CO and CO-releasing molecules (CORMs) in inflammatory and vascular <b>diseases.</b> <b>CORMs</b> have already been tested as a therapeutic agent in clinical trials. More recently, an increased interest has been drawn to CO’s potential use as an anticancer agent. In this review, we will aim to give {{an overview of the}} research focused on the role of CO and CORMs in different types of cancer and expand to the recent development of the next generation CORMs for clinical application in cancer treatment...|$|R
40|$|Crop {{sanitation}} (removal and chopping of residue corms and pseudostems following plant harvest) {{has been}} recommended as a 'best bet' means of reducing banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), populations. However, {{it has been}} unclear when such practices should be carried out and what types of residues should be destroyed. Therefore, trials were conducted in Uganda to determine C. sordidus distribution, timing of attack, and oviposition on crop residues and growing plants. Assessments were performed in on-station trials on different aged standing and prostrate residues by destructive sampling. Similar {{data were collected from}} farmers' fields maintained at low, moderate, and high levels of sanitation. In the on-station trial, oviposition occurred on up to 120 -day-old residues, although most occurred within 30 days of harvest. In a second on-station experiment, oviposition on standing residues was not significantly affected by residue age. By contrast, oviposition on prostrate residues was two times higher on 4 -week-old than on 2 -week-old residues, while the number of larvae on 8 -week-old residues was three times higher than on 2 -week-old residues. The number of adults was twice as high on 16 -week-old residues as that on 2 -week-old residues for both prostrate and standing residues. Farmers' fields maintained at high sanitation had 50 % fewer eggs per residue than farms with low sanitation levels. In general, the number of immatures per residue was 50 % higher on banana corms than on pseudostems. Numbers of larvae per residue were three times more abundant at low than at high sanitation levels. Residues in fields with high sanitation supported 50 % fewer adults than residues in low sanitation fields. The results suggest that removal and <b>splitting</b> of <b>corms</b> after harvest is effective and practical in destroying immature growth stages of the pest and that such practices should be carried out soon after harves...|$|R
40|$|Plantain is an {{important}} staple in West and Central Africa and the Congo basin, yet it is low yielding due to its high susceptibility to a complex of root and <b>corm</b> pests and <b>diseases.</b> Farmers are unaware of nematodes, banana weevil eggs and fungi and {{there is virtually no}} pest and disease control. This study evaluated the effects on plantain bunch fresh yield of factorial combinations of a simple physical sanitation method, paring, followed by five different treatments (control, ash-coating, hot-water treatment, boiling-water treatment and nematicide application). Paring reduced plantain establishment, had no effect on fresh bunch yields but reduced uprooting and improved root health status. Without previous paring, bunch yields after traditional ash-coating (5. 7 Mg ha- 1) and nematicide application (6. 3 Mg ha- 1) were not different from control (4. 6 Mg ha- 1). Hot-water treatment (12. 0 Mg ha- 1) and boiling-water treatment (14. 2 Mg ha- 1) increased yield significantly. Boiling-water treated plantains attained 90 % of the final yield earlier than any other treatment. Yield losses were mainly caused by pseudostem break. Uprooting caused only minor losses. Yield losses can not be attributed to a particular group of pests or diseases but all factors contributing to water deficiency leading to low turgor permitting pseudostem break. Root health parameters were positively related to bunch yield and to bunch mass per producing plant. Due to its simplicity, flexibility, low cost, absence of negative environmental consequences and the accelerated production boiling-water treatment is the most labour efficient and profitable sucker cleaning method...|$|R
40|$|Plantain (Musa spp.) is an {{important}} staple food and cash crop in West and Central Africa. It is highly susceptible to a complex of root and <b>corm</b> pests and <b>diseases</b> and yields are low. Farmers practice virtually no pest or disease control. A simple inexpensive method to clean suckers of most pests and diseases is submerging suckers in boiling water for 30 s. However, with no extension system in place and farmers dispersed in forested territory with poor road infrastructure, disseminating the technology poses a difficulty. Unlike distributing new germplasm, new technologies {{need to be taught}} to farmers, their positive effects need to be demonstrated and farmers may have to accept behavioral changes in order to adopt. In the current case, there is the additional need to convince farmers of the need for a radical treatment to be administered to a commodity in short supply. The approach was a combination of workshop and hands-on demonstration plot establishments. Once farmers agreed to participate, technicians visited the village, gave lessons on plantain sucker health, the presence, symptoms and consequences of nematode (Radopholus similis) infestation, the concept of transmission of pests and diseases and the principle of heat treatment. Farmers prepared suckers for treatment. Treated and untreated suckers were planted in adjacent plots. After the initial workshop phase, adoption ranged from 32 – 47 % (mean 39 %). Follow up revealed that many demonstration plots had been expanded, or abandoned in favor of larger fields planted to ‘boiling water treated’ suckers. Negative consequences of introducing the ‘boiling water treatment’ included social conflict between workshop participants and non-participants and farmers using the technique versus those continuing to plant traditionally prepared suckers. The major reason for abandoning demonstration plots or advanced trials was a shortage of labor. Peer Revie...|$|R
