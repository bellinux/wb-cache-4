50|$|In {{mathematical}} {{set theory}} and model theory, a <b>stationary</b> <b>set</b> {{is one that}} is not too small {{in the sense that it}} intersects all club sets, and is analogous to a set of non-zero measure in set theory. There are at least three closely related notions of <b>stationary</b> <b>set,</b> depending on whether one is looking at subsets of an ordinal, or subsets of something of given cardinality, or a powerset.|$|E
5000|$|No <b>stationary</b> <b>set</b> {{can exist}} below [...] with the {{required}} property because {2,3,4,...} is club in ω but contains no regular ordinals; so κ is uncountable. And it {{is a regular}} limit of regular cardinals; so it is weakly inaccessible. Then one uses the set of uncountable limit cardinals below κ as a club set {{to show that the}} <b>stationary</b> <b>set</b> may be assumed to consist of weak inaccessibles.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} the filter of locally closed unbounded sets and investigate its properties. As one application, we give a characterization of forcing notions that preserve <b>stationary</b> <b>sets</b> (in eo,). Also the local club filter and its variants lead to reflection principles for <b>stationary</b> <b>sets.</b> While the general reflection principle {{is related to}} Martin's Maximum of Foreman, Magidor and Shelah, the reflection at w 2 is equiconsistent with a weakly compact cardinal...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} notion of tightly <b>stationary</b> <b>sets</b> which was {{introduced}} by Foreman and Magidor in ForMag-MS.

40|$|A chain (linearly ordered set) is rigid {{if it has}} no non-trivial automorphisms. The {{construction}} of dense rigid chains {{was carried out by}} Dushnik and Miller for subsets of R, and there is a rather different {{construction of}} dense rigid chains of cardinality, an uncountable regular cardinal, using <b>stationary</b> <b>sets</b> as `codes', which was adapted by Droste in [1] to show the existence of rigid measurable spaces. Here we examine the possibility that nevertheless there could be many order-embeddings of the chain, {{in the sense that the}} whole chain can be embedded into any interval. In the case of subsets of R, an argument involving Baire category is used to modify the original one. For uncountable regular cardinals, a more complicated version of the corresponding argument is used, in which the <b>stationary</b> <b>sets</b> are replaced by sequences of <b>stationary</b> <b>sets,</b> and the chain is built up using a tree. The construction is also adapted to the case of singular cardinals...|$|R

The main result is a precise description of the geometry of the <b>sets</b> of <b>stationary</b> points of the solutions to the wave equation.

50|$|If &lambda; is an ordinal {{number of}} {{uncountable}} cofinality, the nonstationary ideal on &lambda; is {{the collection of}} all subsets of &lambda; that are not <b>stationary</b> <b>sets.</b> This ideal has been studied extensively by W. Hugh Woodin.|$|R
40|$|Working in {{the context}} of {{restricted}} forms of the Axiom of Choice, we consider the problem of splitting the ordinals below λ of cofinality θ into λ many <b>stationary</b> <b>sets,</b> where θ < λ are regular cardinals. This is a continuation of [5]. In this note we consider the issue of splitting <b>stationary</b> <b>sets</b> in the presence of weak forms of the Axiom of Choice plus the existence of certain types of ladder systems. Our primary interest is the theory ZF + DC plus the assertion that for some large enough cardinal λ, there is a ladder system for the members of λ of countable cofinality, that is, a function that assigns to every such α < λ a cofinal subset of ordertype ω. In this context, we show that for every γ < λ of uncountable cofinality the set of α < γ of countable cofinality can be uniformly split into cf(γ) many <b>stationary</b> <b>sets.</b> It follows from this and the results of [5] that there is no nontrivial elementary embedding from V into V, under the assumption of ZF + DC plus the assertion that the countable subsets of each ordinal can be wellordered. As a counterpoint to some of the results presented here, we give a symmetric forcing extension in which there are regressive functions on <b>stationary</b> <b>sets</b> not constant on <b>stationary</b> <b>sets.</b> 1 AC and DC Given a nonempty set Z, the statement ACZ says that whenever 〈Xa: a ∈ Z〉 is a collection of nonempty sets, there is a function f with domain Z such that f(a) ∈ Xa for each a ∈ Z. If γ is an ordinal, the statement AC<γ says that ACη holds for all ordinals η < γ. A tree T is a set of functions such that the domain of each function is an ordinal, and such that, whenever f ∈ T and α ∈ dom(f), fα ∈ T. Tw...|$|R

40|$|We analyze {{efficiency}} of excitation energy transfer in photosynthetic complexes in transient and <b>stationary</b> <b>setting.</b> In the transient setting the absorption process is modeled {{as an individual}} event resulting in a subsequent relaxation dynamics. In the <b>stationary</b> <b>setting</b> the absorption is a continuous stationary process, leading to the nonequilibrium steady state. We show that, {{as far as the}} efficiency is concerned, both settings can be considered to be the same, as they result in almost identical efficiency. We also show that non-Markovianity has no effect on the resulting efficiency, i. e., corresponding Markovian dynamics results in identical efficiency. Even more, if one maps dynamics to appropriate classical rate equations, the same efficiency as in quantum case is obtained. Comment: 11 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

50|$|A {{cardinal}} k is κ-strongly unfoldable, and κ-unfoldable, if {{and only}} if it is weakly compact. A κ+ω-unfoldable cardinal is totally indescribable and preceded by a <b>stationary</b> <b>set</b> of totally indescribable cardinals.|$|E
50|$|We {{show that}} the set of {{uncountable}} strong limit cardinals below κ is club in κ. Let μ0 be {{the larger of the}} threshold and ω1. For each finite n, let μn+1 = 2μn which is less than κ because it is a strong limit cardinal. Then their limit is a strong limit cardinal and is less than κ by its regularity. The limits of uncountable strong limit cardinals are also uncountable strong limit cardinals. So the set of them is club in κ. Intersect that club set with the <b>stationary</b> <b>set</b> of weakly inaccessible cardinals less than κ to get a <b>stationary</b> <b>set</b> of strongly inaccessible cardinals less than κ.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the local topological structure, <b>stationary</b> point <b>sets</b> in parametric optimization genericly may have. Our main result states that, up to stratified isomorphism, any such structure is already {{present in the}} small subclass of parametric problems with convex quadratic objective function and affine-linear constraints. In other words, the convex quadratic problems produce a normal form for the local topological structure of <b>stationary</b> point <b>sets.</b> As a consequence we see, as far as no equality constraints are involved, that {{the closure of the}} <b>stationary</b> point <b>set</b> constitutes a manifold with boundary. The boundary is exactly the violation set of the Mangasarian Fromovitz constraint qualification. A side result states that <b>stationary</b> point <b>sets</b> and violation sets of Mangasarian Fromovitz constraint qualification carry the same set of possible local structures as stratified spaces...|$|R

50|$|To {{show that}} κ {{is a limit}} of hyper-inaccessibles and thus 1-hyper-inaccessible, we need {{to show that the}} {{diagonal}} set of cardinals μ < κ which are α-inaccessible for every α < μ is club in κ. Choose a 0-inaccessible above the threshold, call it α0. Then pick an α0-inaccessible, call it α1. Keep repeating this and taking limits at limits until you reach a fixed point, call it μ. Then μ has the required property (being a simultaneous limit of α-inaccessibles for all α < μ) and is less than κ by regularity. Limits of such cardinals also have the property, so the set of them is club in κ. By Mahlo-ness of κ, there is an inaccessible in this set and it is hyper-inaccessible. So κ is 1-hyper-inaccessible. We can intersect this same club set with the <b>stationary</b> <b>set</b> less than κ to get a <b>stationary</b> <b>set</b> of hyper-inaccessibles less than κ.|$|E

50|$|A {{conductor}} moving {{relative to}} a magnetic field develops an electromotive force (EMF) in it (Faraday's Law). This emf reverses its polarity when it moves under magnetic poles of opposite polarity. Typically, a rotating magnet, called the rotor turns within a <b>stationary</b> <b>set</b> of conductors wound in coils on an iron core, called the stator. The field cuts across the conductors, generating an induced EMF (electromotive force), as the mechanical input causes the rotor to turn.|$|E
