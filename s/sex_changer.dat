40|$|Optimization {{models have}} been widely and {{successfully}} used in evolutionary ecology to predict the attributes of organisms; perhaps the greatest quantitative success is {{in the area of}} sex allocation (sex ratio, sperm versus eggs for hermaphrodites, time as a male [female] for a <b>sex</b> <b>changer),</b> where the fact of having only one mother and one father makes Darwinian fitness a simple product of gain-via-male times gain-via-female. Previous work on sex change used the maximization of this male–female product to successfully predict the direction and age (size) for sex change, and that age has been shown to imply a breeding sex ratio biased towards the first sex. This paper unites recent advances in the comparative demography of organisms with indeterminant growth with the theory of optimal sex change to predict some new invariance rules for the relative age (size) of sex change. One of these rules is strikingly confirmed in a long term study of the size-at-sex-change in the northern shrimp, Pandalus borealis, off Iceland...|$|E
40|$|Sex change (sequential hermaphroditism) is {{a normal}} part of the life history of many species of {{tropical}} coral reef fishes. Sex change can be either from male to female (protandrous) or it can be from female to male (protogynous). In the family Serranidae, protogynous hermaphroditism is the most common reproductive pattern. However, Orange spotted grouper is diandric, i. e., they have two types of male: Primary males which are gonochorous (non <b>sex</b> <b>changers)</b> often with initial phase; and Secondary males which are derived from female to male initial phase...|$|R
50|$|The size-advantage model {{predicts that}} sex change {{would only be}} absent if the {{relationship}} between size/age with reproductive potential is identical in both sexes. With this prediction one would assume that hermaphroditism is very common, {{but this is not}} the case. Sequential hermaphroditism is very rare and according to scientists this is due to some cost that decreases fitness in <b>sex</b> <b>changers</b> as opposed to those who don’t change sex. Some of the hypotheses proposed for the dearth of hermaphrodites are the energetic cost of sex change, genetic and/or physiological barriers to sex change, and sex-specific mortality rates.|$|R
40|$|Repeated visual censuses of {{different}} categories (juveniles, females, territorial and group males) of the stoplight parrotfish (Sparisoma viride, a protogynous hermaphrodite) over a 3 -year period indicated a relatively stable size {{and structure of}} the adult population. This allowed estimates of size-specific mortality, sex change, and territory acquisition probabilities from previously reported growth rates. Comparison of the predicted number of survivors, <b>sex</b> <b>changers,</b> and territory take overs with field observations indicates that our estimates are quite reliable. However, rather large differences in mortality are obtained for the largest three size classes (> 25 cm), which may be due to reduced accuracy of length estimates of large fish. A pooled mortality for these classes is therefore suggested as a more realistic estimate. The life-history implications of our findings are investigated by comparing the predicted survival and future reproductive success of fish that change sex at different sizes. Ten percent of the adults reach an age of ca. 17 years, once a length of 20 cm is attained, as predicted from the pooled estimates. Calculations based on these estimates indicate that the predicted reproductive output of a 15 -year-old fish (2500 matings) is the same for early (i. e. at 20 cm) and late (> 30 cm) <b>sex</b> <b>changers</b> and for an average fish subject to the estimated daily sex change and territory acquisition probabilities. These findings suggest that S. viride individuals are able to flexibly adjust the timing of sex change in an adaptive way to unpredictable local conditions. However, independent mortality estimates are needed to corroborate our present findings...|$|R
40|$|Social {{interactions}} {{can have}} profound {{effects on the}} behavior, physiology, and overall fitness of an individual. An example of this in Lythrypnus dalli is the removal of a male from a social group resulting in a dominant female fish changing sex. The dominant female 2 ̆ 7 s transformation involves a suite of changes including brain, behavior, morphology, and physiology. Following the social trigger (male removal), sex-changing individuals 2 ̆ 7 morphology, steroid levels, {{and changes in the}} behavior were quantified in the field and compared to results found previously in the laboratory. There were lower rates of aggressive and courtship behavior in the field, but the change in behavior over time had a similar pattern and there were parallels in morphology and steroid levels between lab and field <b>sex</b> <b>changers.</b> The brains of dominant females also responded to social change. Aromatase, an enzyme that converts testosterone into estrogen, and oxytocin, a neuropeptide found in mammals, have been associated with vertebrate social and reproductive behavior. The fish homologue of oxytocin, isotocin, and aromatase are both found in L. dalli. Upon removal of a male from the social group, L. dalli dominant females experienced a {{decrease in the number of}} preoptic area isotocin-immunoreactive cells over the course of sex change (7 - 10 days) and a decrease in brain aromatase activity (bAA) levels within hours, but not minutes, of male removal, while gonadal aromatase activity (gAA) decreased at a much slower time scale (beyond a week). Hours, but not minutes, after male removal, the sex-changing individual 2 ̆ 7 s bAA correlated with aggressive behavior increases and not the amount of time following male removal. Males that had just changed from female had different gonadal allocation and higher bAA levels than established males. Subordinate females had high gAA, but their bAA was between that of males and <b>sex</b> <b>changers.</b> In conclusion, dramatic changes in anatomy and neuroendocrine function can occur in response to social cues, individuals with similar reproductive behavior and external morphology can have large neuroendocrine and internal morphologic variation, and social interactions can affect steroid metabolism locally on a short time scale independent of gonadal modulation of steroids...|$|R
40|$|The genus Lythiypnus is a {{group of}} marine gobies that exhibit extreme gender {{flexibility}} as bidirectional <b>sex</b> <b>changers.</b> The genus is distributed in the Neotropics and consists of 20 described species and several undescribed species. The hormonal, morphological, and behavioral aspects of sex change have been studied extensively for one species, L. dalli. These data, however, have never been interpreted in a phylogenetic context because a proper phylogeny had not been established for the genus Lythrypnus. We propose the first phylogenetic hypothesis for the genus based on molecular data from three mitochondrial genes [12 s, ND 2, and cytb) and two nuclear genes (Ragl and S 7). We also include three previously undescribed Lythrypnus species. Our results support the monophyly of the genus with L. heterochroma, an Atlantic species, as the most basal taxon. After the divergence of L. heterochroma, there are two main clades- one comprised of species distributed in the Atlantic the other comprised of species distributed in the Pacific. We mapped patterns of sex allocation within this genus onto the fully resolved and supported topology, and found that sexual plasticity and gender flexibility is likely a synapomorphy for the genus. Overall our results create a well-supported framework to understand the phylogeography of the genus, and to interpret the evolution of sex allocation in Lythiypnus...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In protogynous sex-changing fishes, {{females are}} {{expected}} {{to compete for the}} opportunity to change sex following the loss of a dominant male and may exhibit growth and behavioural traits that help them maintain their dominant status after sex change. A male removal experi-ment was used to examine changes in female growth and behaviour associated with sex change in the haremic wrasse Halichoeres miniatus and to test whether any changes in growth associated with sex change were recorded in otolith microstructure. Dominant females began displaying male-characteristic behaviour almost immediately after the harem male was removed. The fre-quency of interactions between females increased follow-ing male removal. In contrast, feeding frequency of females decreased. The largest one to three females in each social group changed sex following male removal and exhibited an increase in growth associated with <b>sex</b> change. <b>Sex</b> <b>changers</b> grew more than twice as fast as non-sex changers during the experimental period. This growth acceleration may enable new sex-changed males to rapidly reach a size where they can defend the remaining harem from other males. An optical discontinuity (check mark) was present in the otoliths of sex-changed fish, and otolith accretion rate increased significantly after the check mark, corresponding with the increased growth rate of sex-changing females. Wild caught males, but not females, exhibited an analogous check mark in their otoliths and similar increases in otolith increment widths after the check. This indicates that an increase in growth rate is a regular feature of sex-change dynamics of H. miniatus...|$|R
40|$|Social status {{influences}} reproductive physiology in many species, and sex {{change in}} marine teleost fishes {{provides an excellent}} model to understand how an organism can modulate its reproductive system in response to social stimuli. The series of experiments presented in this dissertation {{has focused on the}} proximate mechanisms underlying sex change and, in particular, the neuroendocrine factors that might translate social information into physiological changes. The bluebanded goby (Lythrypnus dalli) is a sexually plastic fish, and the dominant female typically changes sex when the male is removed from the social group. The direct physical interactions between the male and the females were found to be the main sensory cues that inhibit sex change. Sex steroids can both modulate and be modulated by behavior, and as a result they have been the most obvious candidates for {{a key role in the}} regulation of sex change. Males and females showed similar diurnal patterns for steroid hormones, but females had significantly higher water-borne estrogen levels. Concentrations of estradiol, testosterone and 11 -ketotestosterone presented sex and tissue differences in brain, gonad and muscle, and they varied in complex ways in different tissues during sex change. The neurotransmitter serotonin (5 -HT) has been suggested to be involved in the inhibition of socially regulated sex change because of its role in the modulation of both reproductive and aggressive behavior. None of the pharmacological manipulations performed in L. dalli to alter serotonergic activity was able to overcome the input from the social environment and affect sex change. Neither monoamine levels nor the area or number of 5 -HT immunoreactive neurons were different between males, females and <b>sex</b> <b>changers</b> or between dominant and subordinate females. The results do not support the hypothesis of a serotonergic inhibition on sex change in L. dalli, but show that rapid changes in brain androgen levels might be implicated in inducing behavioral or morphological changes associated with sex reversal. Also, steroids respond to changes in the social environment in different ways in different tissues so local steroid synthesis should receive greater attention, and caution is required when using circulating levels to understand behavioral regulation...|$|R
40|$|Typescript. Bibliography: leaves 166 - 171. Microfiche. xiv, 171 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmA {{field and}} {{laboratory}} {{study was conducted}} in Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii, to determine the factors that cause sex change in the fish Thalassoma duperrey, a protogynous, diandric hermaphrodite. Unlike other sequential hermaphrodites that have been studied thus far, this species is non-haremic and non-schooling. By nature of its unique social organization, it could have a special sex-change mechanism. The home ranges of T. duperrey overlap extensively and are distributed randomly or uniformly over the reef. Home-range size and location do not differ between the sexes. Size-related aggressive dominance controls feeding interactions. Sexual maturity is reached at about 60 mm standard length, less than 1 year after fertilization. Gonad development (gonosomatic index, percent gonad weight of body weight) in both males and females peaks at about 120 mm, nearly 2 years later. Terminal-phase coloration typically appears soon thereafter, accompanied by as much as a 10 -fold drop in gonosomatic index. This drop is correlated with a change in spawning mode in males from group to pair spawning, which apparently requires less sperm production. Sex change in females occurs at a mean size of 125 mm, 2 years after sexual maturation. Most females probably change sex in late spring or early summer, after the height of the reproductive season. Transitional gonad stages are similar in structure to those reported in other wrasses. A major change in the reproductive tract is the formation of the sperm duct within and between the urogenital papilla and the oviduct. Anatomical and behavioral evidence points to the existence of three cyclic components in the timing of reproduction: annual, semilunar, and diel. On an annual basis, both percent spawnable ova and number of females spawning are greatest in the winter (December). Over the lunar cycle, the same parameters are greatest during the new and full moon and least during the quarter moons. On a daily basis, they are greatest at the time of high tide during daylight hours. The adaptive significance of having a winter spawning maximum is unknown. Spawning on high spring tides, however, may be an anti-egg-predator or dispersal strategy, or both. Reproductive behavior includes the occurrence of lekking, looping, circling, pectoral fluttering, quivering, and group and pair spawning. Spawning is promiscuous though some females spawn with the same TP male repeatedly. All fish are able to choose spawning partners and initial-phase fish frequently migrate as far as half the reef perimeter to do so. Females spawn at most once a day, but large males pair spawn with as many as 20 or more females per day. This relationship supports the size-advantage model for the evolution of sequential hermaphroditism. A comparison of several population parameters between a small and a large patch reef showed that only fish size differed between reefs (the large reef had larger individuals). This comparison did not support the hypothesis that local population size determines the sexual composition of populations on isolated reefs. An interspecific comparison based on population size and density did support the hypothesis. Both population size and fish density were directly related to the percent of primary males present and inversely related to the percent of terminal-phase males present. To determine the proximate causes of individual sex change, experiments were conducted in outdoor pens or tanks at the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology. Adult wrasses were subjected to various social regimes using size, sex, coloration (phase), density, and type of isolation from conspecifics as independent variables. Single isolated females did not change sex while the larger individuals of paired females did, regardless of absolute size. These results were independent of the amount of space available to the fish. Females paired with smaller initial-phase males also changed sex, but those paired with smaller heterospecific wrasses did not. A tactile barrier separating two females did not prevent sex change in the larger fish. However, a tactile-visual barrier placed between two females significantly reduced the percentage of sex changes. Sex change did not occur when only olfactory cues were available but did occur when only visual cues were available. The presence of an initial-phase or terminal-phase male did not suppress sex change in larger female wrasses. In the case of female threesomes, only the largest female changed sex, demonstrating inhibition of sex change in the intermediate-sized fish. These results show that sex change is socially controlled in T. duperrey. It is dependent upon stimulation from smaller conspecifics and is inhibited in the presence of larger conspecific females. The stimulation-inhibition process suggests that, in nature, the ratio of the number of smaller fish to larger fish would actually control the initiation of sex change in candidate females. The ratio of the number of behavioral interactions with smaller fish to that with larger fish would be the equivalent behavioral mechanism. Either mechanism would function to predict the number of females available as mates for potential <b>sex</b> <b>changers.</b> The precise role of behavior in this mechanism will require further experimentation...|$|R
