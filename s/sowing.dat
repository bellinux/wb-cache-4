40|$|This thesis compares {{growth and}} {{behaviour}} of domestic <b>sows</b> and piglets in confined pens versus get-away pens (where <b>sows</b> could leave their fitters at will), {{to ask whether}} parent-offspring conflict occurs, whether it increases with offspring age, whether it involves offspring access to the udder, and whether it affects animal production or welfare. Parent-offspring conflict occurs in domestic pigs: piglets of Confined <b>sows</b> suckled more and ate less solid food but grew {{at the same rate}} as piglets from Get-away <b>sows,</b> indicating they obtained more milk. Confined <b>sows</b> lost more weight than Get-away <b>sows</b> and returned to oestrus later, indicating a fitness cost of providing the additional milk. Parent-offspring conflict increased with piglet age: as the fitter aged, Get-away <b>sows</b> spent more time away from their young and the differences between Get-away <b>sows</b> and Confined <b>sows</b> in weight loss and nursing frequency increased. In Get-away <b>sows,</b> the reduction in contact with their young occurred rapidly, but its timing varied greatly among individual <b>sows.</b> Behavioural conflict over access to the udder is a plausible mechanism by which conflict is expressed in swine: piglets from Confined pens spent more time nuzzling the udder than piglets of Get-away <b>sows.</b> Piglets from Get-away <b>sows</b> nuzzled the udder a higher proportion of the time when the <b>sow</b> was present than piglets from Confined <b>sows.</b> Get-away <b>sows</b> terminated more nursings than Confined <b>sows</b> thus limiting the amount of contact piglets had with the udder after nursing. Mowing <b>sows</b> to control maternal provisioning improved productivity: there was a slight benefit of reduced time to the next oestrus for Get-away <b>sows.</b> Piglets from Get-away <b>sows</b> gained more weight and consumed more food after weaning than piglets from Confined <b>sows.</b> There was only slight evidence that get-away pens reduced behavioural indicators of post-weaning stress (e. g., movements, vocalizations, response to playback of vocalizations) for either the p...|$|R

The gestation housing systems were individual crates in a mechanically ventilated confinement building (CRATE) and, group-housed <b>sows</b> in a modified-open front building (MOF) or a bedded hoop structure (HOOP). All <b>sows</b> were fed individually. The group-housed <b>sows</b> were fed with either feeding stalls (FS) or electronic feeders (EF). The two <b>sow</b> genotypes were Yorkshire x Landrace (WHITE <b>sows)</b> and Hampshire x Yorkshire x Landrace (COLOR <b>sows).</b> The Yorkshire and Landrace breeding was similar in both genotypes.

This study examined the effects of regrouping gestating <b>sows</b> and the administration of exogenous glucocorticoids on the growth and external reproductive morphology of pigs. At 37. 2 ± 0. 26 d of gestation, 6 cohorts of 18 <b>sows</b> (N = 108) were placed in 1 of 3 treatments: socially stable (Stable), hydrocortisone acetate (HCA), or mixed (Mixed). The HCA <b>sows</b> were administered 70 mg HCA, a synthetic glucocorticoid, twice daily during the 21 d experimental period. Each Mixed <b>sow</b> was penned with 2 companion <b>sows</b> (Companion) and regrouped on d 7 and 14 with 2 different Companion <b>sows</b> in a new pen. Stable and HCA <b>sows</b> were penned in treatment groups of 3 <b>sows.</b> <b>Sow</b> social rank was assessed weekly during feeding. After the 21 d experimental period, all <b>sows</b> were housed in gestation stalls for the duration of pregnancy. During the 21 d, Companion <b>sows</b> gained more weight than HCA and Mixed <b>sows</b> (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) with Stable <b>sows</b> intermediate.

Skin thickening in response to concanavalin A, a lymphocyte mitogen, was greater in <b>sows</b> with the smallest spaces compared to <b>sows</b> with the largest spaces (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). No other measures of <b>sow</b> health, physiology, or production were affected by the group space size (P 3 ̆e 0. 10). In contrast to health and physiology measures, the <b>sows</b> 2 ̆ 7 behavior differed with pen size. <b>Sows</b> with the smallest spaces were observed more frequently in stalls (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) and less frequently in the group space (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) than <b>sows</b> in other pen sizes and they exhibited the smallest increase in group space use with time (P 3 ̆c 0. 01). <b>Sows</b> with the smallest group space stood less at wk 2 and wk 5 than <b>sows</b> with the mid-sized pens (P ≤ 0. 05), but the amount of time <b>sows</b> spent manipulating the pen and fixtures was not affected by space. Social interaction was reduced among <b>sows</b> with the smallest group space compared to <b>sows</b> with the largest space (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) and tended to be reduced compared to <b>sows</b> with a mid-sized pen (P = 0. 99). Although the activity of the <b>sows</b> was unaffected by space allowance, space utilization and social interactions were restricted in the smallest group size. Overall, <b>sow</b> welfare in the two larger pens was better than in the smallest pen because there was greater ability to express normal behavior, but the welfare differences were small and did not impact the <b>sow</b> health, physiology, or productivity. ^ Increased maternal stress during gestation can prenatally stress developing fetuses which may alter offspring development. In rodents prenatal stress masculinizes female and feminizes male rodent offspring by altering reproductive development. In swine production regrouping gestating <b>sows</b> is a common stressful practice, but its impact on the reproductive potential of piglets is unknown. The second study examined the effects of regrouping gestating <b>sows</b> on the development of reproductive morphology in piglets. <b>Sows</b> were assigned to 1 of 3 treatments during mid-gestation: socially stable (Stable), hydrocortisone acetate (HCA) treatment, and mixed (Mixed). Each Mixed <b>sow</b> was penned with 2 companion <b>sows</b> (Companion). Mixed <b>sows</b> were regrouped on d 7 and d 14 of the 21 d treatment, by removing them from their current groups and placing them in pens with 2 different Companion <b>sows.</b> Stable and HCA <b>sows</b> were penned in groups of 3 by treatment and remained in their original group through the treatment. To simulate a physiological stress response, HCA <b>sows</b> were orally administered 70 mg HCA twice daily. ^ Mixing was stressful to the <b>sows.</b> At the end of the treatment, Companion <b>sows</b> weighed more than HCA and Mixed <b>sows</b> (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) with Stable <b>sows</b> intermediate but not different than the other treatments. Cortisol concentration was greater in HCA <b>sows</b> (P = 0. 0004) than <b>sows</b> in the other treatments. Mixed <b>sows</b> had greater head lesion scores than Stable and HCA <b>sows</b> (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) with Companion <b>sows</b> intermediate. The <b>sow</b> 2 ̆ 7 s treatment did not affect farrowing rate, gestation length, litter size or sex ratio of the piglets (P 3 ̆e 0. 10). The prenatal environment almost exclusively affected the male piglets. Pre-weaning mortality was higher among male piglets from HCA <b>sows</b> compared with males from Mixed <b>sows</b> (P = 0. 04) with mortality in the other treatments intermediate. Male pigs from Mixed <b>sows</b> tended to have greater birth weights than males from Companion <b>sows</b> (P = 0. 07), but there were no other differences during the lactation period. However, at 160 d of age, males from HCA <b>sows</b> weighed more than males from Stable <b>sows</b> (P = 0. 01). Anogenital distance, a marker of fetal testosterone, was longer in male piglets born to Companion <b>sows</b> than male piglets from Mixed <b>sows</b> (P = 0. 03) with the other treatments intermediate.

The rearing ability of gilts compared to older <b>sows</b> is also observed to be lower, however, factors such as piglet birth weight and suckling demand can affect litter gains from gilts and <b>sows.</b> The project reported here investigated the outcomes from cross-fostering litters of gilt progeny onto older parity <b>sows,</b> and vice versa: heavier <b>sow</b> progeny onto gilts or primiparous <b>sows.</b> These were compared with fostered and un-fostered piglets within gilts and <b>sows.</b> Two hundred and forty gilts and <b>sows</b> (parity 3 - 7) were allocated after farrowing to one of six treatments: Gilts with birth progeny (GB); gilts with fostered gilt progeny (GG); gilts with fostered <b>sow</b> progeny (GS); <b>sows</b> with birth progeny (SB); <b>sows</b> with fostered gilt progeny (SG); and <b>sows</b> with fostered <b>sow</b> progeny (SS). The progeny were followed through to weaning and post-weaning growth, feed efficiency and mortality assessments were made until 21 weeks of age when they were slaughtered. There was no overall net benefit to the weaned population by litter swapping progen...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine if porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) could persist in non-pregnant <b>sows</b> and if persistently infected <b>sows</b> could transmit virus to naive contact controls. Twelve PRRSV-naive, non-pregnant <b>sows</b> (index <b>sows)</b> were infected with a field isolate of PRRSV and housed in individual isolation rooms for 42 to 56 days postinfection. Following this period, 1 naive contact <b>sow</b> was placed in each room divided by a gate allowing nose-to-nose contact with a single index <b>sow.</b> Index <b>sows</b> were not viremic at the time of contact <b>sow</b> entry. Virus nucleic acid was detected by polymerase chain reaction, and infectious virus was detected by virus isolation in sera from 3 of the 12 contact <b>sows</b> at 49, 56, and 86 days postinfection. All 3 infected contacts developed PRRSV antibodies. Virus nucleic acid was detected in tissues of all of the 12 index <b>sows</b> at 72 or 86 days postinfection. Nucleic acid sequencing indicated that representative samples from index and infected contacts were homologous (> 99 %) to the PRRSV used to infect index <b>sows</b> at the onset of the study. This study demonstrates that PRRSV can persist in <b>sows</b> and that persistently infected <b>sows</b> can transmit virus to naive contact animals...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} split-weaning (SW) on: weaning to oestrus {{interval}} (WOI), <b>sow</b> reproductive performance, piglet growth and body weight and backfat development, was studied in 319 {{first and second}} parity <b>sows.</b> In <b>sows</b> of the control group (C) piglets were weaned at about 4 weeks of age. In the SW <b>sows</b> the heaviest piglets were weaned at about 3 weeks, leaving 6 piglets with the <b>sow</b> to be weaned at 4 weeks of age. SW and parity affected the WOI; the WOI was reduced in SW <b>sows</b> and in second parity <b>sows.</b> Body weight loss and reduction in backfat may explain the effects on WOI as found. Second parity SW <b>sows</b> showed a higher farrowing rate compared with second parity C and first parity <b>sows.</b> No effect of SW {{on the size of}} the next litter was found. The growth of piglets during the fourth week of lactation was higher in piglets of the SW <b>sows.</b> Piglet growth during a six week rearing period was worse in SW piglets weaned at three weeks. However, when reared up to the same age, the growth of these piglets was comparable with that of piglets weaned at four weeks.

40|$|Measures of production, physiology, {{behaviour}} and pathology {{were used}} to assess the effects of confined and loose dry <b>sow</b> and farrowing housing systems on the welfare of the <b>sow</b> and her litter. Litter size decreased and piglet mortality increased greatly after the sixth parity, regardless of housing system, resulting in a sharp {{decline in the number of}} piglets weaned per litter. Stall-housed <b>sows</b> gave birth to the most piglets per <b>sow</b> per year, but also had the highest piglet mortality. Overall, piglet mortality was higher in farrowing pens than in crates. <b>Sows</b> from the large group had a significantly larger number of returns to service after farrowing in crates. Behaviourally, all <b>sows</b> adapted well to the farrowing house. All <b>sows</b> showed an increase in the number of posture changes, reaching a maximum during the 24 hours immediately prior to parturition. However, this increase was greatest in those <b>sows</b> in farrowing crates, which had previously been housed in an open environment. Heart rate was influenced by stage of gestation, posture and behaviour. Stall-housed <b>sows</b> had a higher basal heart rate and heart rate response to feeding than group-housed <b>sows,</b> perhaps indicating decreased cardiovascular fitness and an increased sympathetic nervous response to stimuli such as food. When farrowing in crates, group-housed <b>sows</b> had a higher heart rate response to the suckling event than stall-housed <b>sows.</b> This may be due to general unresponsiveness in stalled <b>sows</b> or to high reactivity to the suckling event in group <b>sows</b> caused by frustration of mother-infant interaction. When involved in agonistic interactions, the change in heart rate was greatest for <b>sows</b> which lost a physical interaction. Stall-housed <b>sows</b> had weaker bones than group-housed <b>sows,</b> and different muscular conformation, probably due to lack of exercise. Bone and muscle weakness may increase the susceptibility of stall-housed <b>sows</b> to lameness. When lying down, stall-housed <b>sows</b> had greater difficulty and took longer than group-housed <b>sows.</b> The times taken for stall <b>sows</b> to lie down and to stand up quickly were positively correlated with body length. For group-housed <b>sows</b> lying down in the open, the time taken was positively correlated with proportional locomotory muscle weight. Spatial restriction when lying resulted in the loss of muscular control. There was a positive correlation between body length and the number of piglets crushed for stallhoused <b>sows</b> and group-housed <b>sows</b> farrowing in crates. There was also a positive correlation between body length and crushing mortality for group-housed <b>sows</b> farrowing in pens. This indicates that <b>sows</b> can have problems controlling movements, even in the presence of piglets. The results presented reveal several welfare problems resulting from stall housing during pregnancy. It would appear unreasonable to confine <b>sows</b> during farrowing, if they have previously been housed in an open environment. However, not enough is known about the causes of piglet mortality and any decision concerning the continued use of farrowing crates must take account of the trade-off between <b>sow</b> welfare and piglet welfare.
