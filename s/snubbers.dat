40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{a passive}} {{lossless}} <b>snubber</b> circuit for {{pulse width modulation}} (PWM) inverters is proposed to achieve soft-switching purpose without extra switch or additional control circuitry. This passive lossless soft-switching <b>snubber</b> employs an inductor/capacitor <b>snubber</b> structure for each switching device in an inverter to achieve passive zero-current turn ON and zero-voltage turn OFF. Furthermore, inductors coupled closely on a single core are used to losslessly recover <b>snubber</b> energy to the in-put in the proposed <b>snubber.</b> In addition, freewheeling of output phase current of inverters can be realized via energy storage com-ponents of the <b>snubber</b> during the dead time to reduce the effect of dead time. The distortion ratio of the output phase current in low output frequency is also reduced. All components in the <b>snubber</b> circuit are passive, and thus have a better price/performance ratio than their active counterparts.

50|$|<b>Snubbers</b> are {{frequently}} used in electrical systems with an inductive load where the sudden interruption of current flow {{leads to a}} sharp rise in voltage across the current switching device, in accordance with Faraday's law. This transient can {{be a source of}} electromagnetic interference (EMI) in other circuits. Additionally, if the voltage generated across the device is beyond what the device is intended to tolerate, it may damage or destroy it. The snubber provides a short-term alternative current path around the current switching device so that the inductive element may be discharged more safely and quietly. Inductive elements are often unintentional, but arise from the current loops implied by physical circuitry. While current switching is everywhere, <b>snubbers</b> will generally only be required where a major current path is switched, such as in power supplies. <b>Snubbers</b> are also often used to prevent arcing across the contacts of relays and switches and the electrical interference and welding/sticking of the contacts that can occur (see also arc suppression).|$|E

5000|$|Hydraulic Snubber: Similar to an {{automobile}} shock arrestor the hydraulic <b>snubber</b> {{is built around}} a cylinder containing hydraulic fluid with a piston that displaces the fluid {{from one end of}} the cylinder to the other. Displacement of fluid results from the movement of the pipe causing the piston to displace within the cylinder resulting in high pressure in one end of the cylinder and a relatively low pressure in the other. The velocity of the piston will dictate the actual difference in pressure. The fluid passes through a spring-loaded valve, the spring being used to hold the valve open. If the differential pressure across the valve exceeds the effective pressure exerted by the spring, the valve will close. This causes the <b>snubber</b> to become rigid and further displacement is substantially prevented. The hydraulic <b>snubber</b> is normally used when the axis of restraint is in the direction of expansion and contraction of the pipe. The <b>snubber</b> is therefore required to extend or retract with the normal operation of the pipe work. The <b>snubber</b> has low resistance to movement at very low velocities.|$|R
