25|$|The protein or {{membrane}} environment {{could respond}} to an external field {{in a number of}} different ways. Field induced dipoles, reorientation of permanent dipoles, protonation and deprotonation of protein residues, larger scale reorganization of ionized side-chains and water molecules, both within the interior and on the surface of the protein, are all examples of how complicated the assignment of permittivity is. In MD simulations, where all the charges, dipoles, and field induced atomic dipoles are treated explicitly then it is suggested that a dielectric value of 1 is appropriate. However, in reduced-particle ion simulation programs, such as ours, where the protein, membrane, and water are continuum backgrounds and treated implicitly, and on top of that, the ion motion takes place on the same time-scale as the protein’s response to its presence, it is very difficult to assign the dielectric coefficients. In fact, changing the dielectric coefficients could easily alter the channel characteristics, such as ion permeation and selectivity The assignment of dielectric coefficient for water is another key issue. The water molecules inside ion channels could be very ordered due to tapered size of the pore, which is often lined with highly charged residues, or hydrogen bond formation between water molecules and protein. As a result, the dielectric constant of water inside an ion channel could be quite different from the value under bulk conditions. To make the matter even more complicated, the dielectric coefficients of water inside nanopores is not necessarily an isotropic <b>scalar</b> <b>value,</b> but an anisotropic tensor having different values in different directions.|$|E

2500|$|The {{coefficient}} of friction (COF), often symbolized by the Greek letter µ, is a dimensionless <b>scalar</b> <b>value</b> which describes {{the ratio of the}} force of friction between two bodies and the force pressing them together. The {{coefficient of}} friction depends on the materials used; for example, ice on steel has a low {{coefficient of friction}}, while rubber on pavement has a high coefficient of friction. Coefficients of friction range from near zero to greater than one. [...] It is an axiom of the nature of friction between metal surfaces that it is greater between two surfaces of the similar metals than between two surfaces of different metals— hence, brass will have a higher coefficient of friction when moved against brass, but less if moved against steel or aluminum.|$|E
