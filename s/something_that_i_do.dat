[...] Due to the event being accidental and unintentional, Jackson refused to release another apology statement to media outlets following this.

60|$|I {{had almost}} {{forgotten}} to make {{mention of the}} Gulf Stream, in which we found ourselves previous to crossing the Banks. The fact, of our being in it was proved by the captain in person, who superintended the drawing of a bucket of salt water, in which he dipped his thermometer. In {{the absence of the}} Gulf-weed, this is the general test; for the temperature of this current is eight degrees higher than that of the ocean, and the temperature of the ocean is twenty degrees higher than that of the Grand Banks. And it is to this remarkable difference of temperature, for which there can be no equilibrium, that many seamen impute the fogs on the coast of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland; but why there should always be such ugly weather in the Gulf, is <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know has ever been accounted for.|$|E

It must have made a deep impression on this occasion, however, because that night I had a vivid dream involving this tile pattern, and somehow the notion of ‘whatever colour you land on, your opponent must move a piece that matches this.’ I guess my subconscious mind had been working on this and sorted it out while I was asleep." ...|$|E

The cause was never officially diagnosed but Sean has said that they (the doctors) had suspected {{spinal meningitis}}. [...] Sean's parents bought him a drum set when he was 5 years old and he started writing songs and playing guitar when he was 10. Sean grew up playing music with his siblings. His dad, Scott Forbes, is in a Detroit country-rock band called The Forbes Brothers. Sean's mom is a pianist.

[...] According to Sunan Ibn Majah, the Prophet is reported to have said, [...] "Even if there was only one day left of this world, Allah would make it last until a man from my household took possession of (the mountain of) Dailam and Constantinople." [...] According to Sunan Ibn Majah, the Prophet is reported to have said, [...] "We, the sons of 'Abdul-Muttalib, will be leaders of the people of Paradise: Myself, Hamzah.

[...] According to Sunan Ibn Majah, the Prophet is reported to have said, [...] "Three will fight one another for your treasure, each one of them the son of a caliph, but none of them will gain it.

3000|$|Before {{reporting}} data {{addressing the}} research questions guiding the study, we first discuss how respondents had differing notions of what activities constituted “studying.” For some, it meant any exposure to course material such as attending a class, whereas for others, studying implied completing assigned tasks. In yet other cases studying referred to activities that were not assigned and took place outside of class. As one student said, “I see studying more as <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> separate from any assigned material.” In addition to these task-oriented conceptions, some reported “folk” theories of the learning or ideas about phenomena that are not necessarily grounded in evidence. For example, one student stated, “Studying to me means stressing out your brain so that it realizes that the information is significant.” [...]...|$|E
40|$|The {{existing}} body {{of scholarship}} on Kant’s Critique of Judgment {{is rife with}} disagreement. At the centre of much of this disagreement {{is the issue of}} precisely what Kant understands to be taking place in a harmonization of the cognitive faculties. Is aesthetic reflective judgment to be identified with, or separated from, this harmonious state of the faculties of imagination and understanding? If aesthetic judgment is identified with this state, as is argued herein, then upon what is a judgment of beauty to be based? These questions are addressed by focussing on two closely related aspects of Kant’s theory of reflective judgment; the role Kant assigns to the power of desire (i. e., to the will) and to the causal structure implicated in reflective judgment. In brief, we argue that a judgment of beauty is not, strictly speaking, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> but is better described that something that happens of itsel...|$|E
