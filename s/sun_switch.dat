50|$|Variations of the {{headline}} are frequently {{used in the}} UK media during elections. The phrase was used again by many political commentators after the 1997 general election when The <b>Sun</b> <b>switched</b> sides and supported Labour's new leader Tony Blair, who won the election by a landslide. However, unlike in 1992, opinion polls {{for most of the}} inter-election period had consistently suggested that a Labour victory was likely.|$|R

50|$|Solaris 2.0, {{the first}} {{release of the}} {{successor}} to SunOS 4, included OpenWindows 3.0.1. Starting with Solaris 2.3 in late 1993, <b>Sun</b> <b>switched</b> to a standard X11R5 release of X11. It was still called OpenWindows (now version 3.3), but the NeWS protocol was replaced by support for Display PostScript. Support for SunView applications was removed. The graphical {{look and feel of}} the window manager and tools was still based on OPEN LOOK. Solaris 7 featured OpenWindows 3.6.1, with an X11R6.4 server.|$|R

50|$|After Dracula revived and {{defeated}} his plans, Dr. <b>Sun</b> <b>switched</b> tactics. He discovered Nova's {{link to the}} supercomputers of Xandar. He captured Nova and intended to plug into the computers from Earth. When the Sphinx commandeered Nova's ship directly to Xandar, Sun abandoned his body and invaded the Xandarian computers directly. When the Fantastic Four later arrived with H.E.R.B.I.E., Sun downloaded into the robot's body. Upon returning to Earth, he tried to destroy the FF by turning their headquarters against them. He took possession of the Baxter Building's computer system. This freed H.E.R.B.I.E., who flew into the computer bank where Sun was isolated. Dr. Sun was presumed destroyed in the resultant explosion.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Sun</b> <b>switched</b> {{support to}} the Labour party on 18 March 1997, six weeks before the General Election victory which saw the New Labour leader Tony Blair become Prime Minister with a large {{parliamentary}} majority, despite the paper having attacked Blair and New Labour up to a month earlier. Its front page headline read THE SUN BACKS BLAIR and its front page editorial made clear that while it still opposed some New Labour policies, such as the minimum wage and devolution, it believed Blair to be [...] "the {{breath of fresh air}} this great country needs". John Major's Conservatives, it said, were [...] "tired, divided and rudderless". Blair, who had radically altered his party's image and policies, noting the influence the paper could have over its readers' political thinking, had courted it (and Murdoch) for some time by granting exclusive interviews and writing columns.|$|R
5000|$|Jane Stevenson of Toronto <b>Sun</b> said <b>Switch</b> [...] "raises as many {{questions}} as it answers" [...] about INXS's future, in a three-and-a-half {{out of five}} stars review. She echoed Zuel's comments that the album sounded like INXS were [...] "stuck in the '80s." [...] Despite this, the review noted that the album {{could have been a}} good deal worse—Farriss' collaborations with Chambers and Child were praised, described as slick and well-polished.|$|R
5|$|Homing pigeons use {{magnetic}} field information with other navigational cues. Pioneering researcher William Keeton showed that time-shifted homing pigeons could not orient themselves correctly {{on a clear}} sunny day, but could do so on an overcast day, suggesting that the birds prefer {{to rely on the}} direction of the <b>sun,</b> but <b>switch</b> to using a {{magnetic field}} cue when the sun is not visible. This was confirmed by experiments with magnets: the pigeons could not orient correctly on an overcast day when the magnetic field was disrupted.|$|R
50|$|Since its {{standardization}} in 1986, SCSI {{has been}} {{commonly used in}} the Amiga, Atari, Apple Macintosh and Sun Microsystems (now part of Oracle Corporation) computer lines and PC server systems. Apple started using Parallel ATA (also known as IDE) for its low-end machines with the Macintosh Quadra 630 in 1994, and added it to its high-end desktops starting with the Power Macintosh G3 in 1997. Apple dropped on-board SCSI completely (in favor of IDE and FireWire) with the (Blue & White) Power Mac G3 in 1999, while still offering a PCI controller card as an option {{on up to the}} Power Macintosh G4 (AGP Graphics) models. <b>Sun</b> <b>switched</b> its lower-end range to Serial ATA (SATA). Commodore included a SCSI interface on the Amiga 3000/3000T systems and it was an add-on to previous Amiga 500/2000 models. Starting with the Amiga 600/1200/4000 systems Commodore switched to the IDE interface. Atari included SCSI interface as standard in its Atari MEGA STE, Atari TT and Atari Falcon computer models. SCSI has never been popular in the low-priced IBM PC world, owing to the lower cost and adequate performance of ATA hard disk standard. However, SCSI drives and even SCSI RAIDs became common in PC workstations for video or audio production.|$|R
5000|$|... "God's Top Ten" [...] {{was written}} by INXS guitarist and keyboardist, Andrew Farriss, and is {{predominantly}} about the late INXS frontman Michael Hutchence (1960-1997), his partner, Paula Yates (1959-2000), and their daughter, Tiger Lily. Andrew and Tim Farriss (his brother, on guitar) have both separately said in TV interviews that this song is actually a gift for Tiger. In addition to new lead singer, J. D. Fortune's vocals, [...] "God's Top Ten" [...] also features the vocals of his fellow Rock Star: INXS contestant Suzie McNeil. Jane Stevenson of the Toronto <b>Sun</b> reviewed <b>Switch</b> (November 2005) and described this track [...] "A pretty piano hook kicks off this soulful, strings-laden tribute to couple and their daughter with McNeil and Fortune trading verses and singing together".|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} solar cycle {{prediction}} methods and their performance is given, including forecasts for cycle 24 {{and focusing on}} aspects of the solar cycle prediction problem that have a bearing on dynamo theory. The scope of the review is further restricted {{to the issue of}} predicting the amplitude (and optionally the epoch) of an upcoming solar maximum no later than right after the start of the given cycle. Prediction methods form three main groups. Precursor methods rely on the value of some measure of solar activity or magnetism at a specified time to predict the amplitude of the following solar maximum. Their implicit assumption is that each numbered solar cycle is a consistent unit in itself, while solar activity seems to consist of a series of much less tightly intercorrelated individual cycles. Extrapolation methods, in contrast, are {{based on the premise that}} the physical process giving rise to the sunspot number record is statistically homogeneous, i. e., the mathematical regularities underlying its variations are the same at any point of time, and therefore it lends itself to analysis and forecasting by time series methods. Finally, instead of an analysis of observational data alone, model based predictions use physically (more or less) consistent dynamo models in their attempts to predict solar activity. In their overall performance precursor methods have clearly been superior to extrapolation methods. Nevertheless, some extrapolation methods may still be worth further study. Model based forecasts have not yet have had a chance to prove their skills. One method that has yielded predictions consistently in the right range during the past few solar cycles is that of K. Schatten et al., whose approach is mainly based on the polar field precursor. The incipient cycle 24 will probably mark the end of the Modern Maximum, with the <b>Sun</b> <b>switching</b> to a state of less strong activity. Comment: 53 pages, 9 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop a LabVIEW code for the solar panel system in the Renewable Energy Zone in the Fites Center. This system consists of three photovoltaic panels which will be analyzed in ME 374 Heat Power Laboratory. Students in this laboratory will examine the performance benefits of the solar panel as it tracks the sun versus when it remains at a fixed orientation. While tracking the <b>sun,</b> mechanical <b>switches</b> are used to ensure the solar panel system does not exceed the rotational limits. To find the correct orientation, the LabVIEW code calculates the location of the sun in terms of azimuth and elevation angles based on the date and time from the computer. These angles determine how the solar panel must be oriented so that it remains perpendicular to the sun’s rays. To ensure the panels are oriented properly, encoders attached to the motors communicate the rotational displacement of the motor shaft to the program. Currently, the limit switches will limit the motor rotation, the tracking program will define the proper angles; however, the program does not yet accurately receive the encoder feedback. Proper analysis of the encoder signal will complete this project...|$|R

5000|$|Although Easter Sun {{had spent}} most of his career racing over {{distances}} of around a mile and a quarter, his regular jockey Bruce Raymond had always believed that the horse would be better over a longer distance. On his first appearance of 1982 the horse was moved up in class and distance for the Aston Park Stakes, a weight-for-age contest over one mile five furlongs at Newbury Racecourse in May in which he faced by the established Group race performers Prince Bee (winner of the Gordon Stakes, Great Voltigeur Stakes and Prix Niel) and Critique (Cumberland Lodge Stakes). Racing on firm ground and receiving weight from his two principal opponents, he accelerated into the lead inside the final furlong and won by half a length from Critique with a gap of seven lengths back to Prince Bee in third. On 3 June Eater Sun made his first appearance in a Group race when he started a 20/1 outsider in an eight runner field for the Group One Coronation Cup at Epsom. Glint of Gold was made favourite ahead of the French challenger Lancastrian, whilst the other runners were Critique, Prince Bee, Castle Keep (Doonside Cup), Protection Racket (Irish St Leger) and Glint of Gold's pacemaker Show-A-Leg. After being restrained by Rymond in the early stages Easter <b>Sun</b> was <b>switched</b> to the outside in the straight, took the lead from Glint of Gold in the final furlong and won by half a length with Critique two and a half lengths back in third place. After the race Lady Beaverbrook said [...] "Ive always had faith in Easter Sun, he shouldn't have been a handicapper at all. I told Michael Jarvis to have more confidence and that he was a group horse. I told Raymond off too. I told him that he is too placid and that he has to have more fire".|$|R
40|$|Ulysses, {{launched}} on 6 October 1990, {{was placed in}} an elliptical, high inclined (80. 2 &deg;) orbit around the <b>Sun,</b> and was <b>switched</b> off in June 2009. It {{has been the only}} spacecraft exploring high-latitude regions of the inner heliosphere. The Kiel Electron Telescope (KET) aboard Ulysses measures electrons from 3 MeV to a few GeV and protons and helium in the energy range from 6 MeV/nucleon to above 2 GeV/nucleon. The PAMELA (Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration and Light-nuclei Astrophysics) space borne experiment was {{launched on}} 15 June 2006 and is continuously collecting data since then. The apparatus measures electrons, positrons, protons, anti-protons and heavier nuclei from about 100 MeV to several hundreds of GeV. Thus the combination of Ulysses and PAMELA measurements is ideally suited to determine the spatial gradients during the extended minimum of solar cycle 23. For protons in the rigidity interval 1. 6 &ndash; 1. 8 GV we find a radial gradient of 2. 7 %/AU and a latitudinal gradient of &minus; 0. 024 %/degree. Although the latitudinal gradient is as expected negative, its value is much smaller than predicted by current particle propagation models. This result is of relevance for the study of propagation parameters in the inner heliosphere...|$|R
