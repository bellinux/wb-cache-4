40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{role of the}} layered-silicates in a styrene-butadiene-styrene {{triblock copolymer}} (SBS) {{as a function of}} layered-silicate dispersion during deformation was investigated. Predominantly immiscible composites of mixed morphology provided the initial proof that dramatic alteration of the SBS deformation behavior exists, but a clear {{understanding of the nature of}} reinforcement was precluded due to the fiber symmetric orientation of the SBS and the mixed clay morphologies. Following the theory of Vaia and Giannelis, use of a more hydrophobic organically modified clay resulted in an intercalated morphology with a near single crystalline texture of the SBS due to roll-casting. Significant heterogeneous deformation was observed at ambient conditions as well as at elevated temperature as verified through Cohen's affine deformation model in combination with Kratky's scattering pattern model. The intercalated morphology shows little or modest mechanical property enhancements at all temperatures studied. Exfoliated nanocomposite was produced by functionalization of the clay surfaces with polystyrene, altering the enthalpic interactions. Entropic interactions were also controlled by varying the molecular weight of the surfactant and the grafting density and shows remarkable agreement with the theory proposed by Balazs et al. Due to the increase <b>surface</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio</b> of the clay, a flipping transition of the block copolymer morphology was observed during roll-casting producing a near single crystalline parallel/parallel clay/BCP orientation. The modulus was relatively unaffected whereas the toughness increased significantly due to an earlier onset of strain hardening. by Yung-Hoon Sam Ha. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|In this work, we {{investigate}} the thermal and mechanical properties of aluminum metal and alumina (?- Al 2 O 3) ceramics by performing {{molecular dynamic simulation}} (MD) using two versions of reactive force fields (ReaxFF) for Al and Al 2 O 3. We also use embedded atom model (EAM) potentials for the aluminum metal simulations. The MD simulations for thermal and mechanical properties are performed for different temperatures ranging from 0 to 1400 K and pressures ranging from 0 to 8 GPa. We also investigate the surface formation energy of solid aluminum and alumina for different temperatures. The surface formation MD simulations serve two purposes: first, to obtain the surface formation energies of aluminum and alumina using the EAM, ReaxFF potentials at different temperatures; and second, to acquire the relaxed alumina surfaces at the temperatures 700 to 1400 K {{in order to use}} the final atomic configurations of the wetting simulations as the initial structure of surfaces of alumina substrate. The main result of this work is the investigation of the wetting and interface chemistry of molten aluminum droplets of the ?-Alumina (0001) surface through MD simulations by employing the ReaxFF potentials. Wetting and interface chemistry are studied for different temperatures from 700 to 1400 K for four different droplet sizes: 16, 24, 32 and 40 ? diameters. Chemical reactions are observed at all temperatures and sizes in addition to diffusion between droplet and sphere atoms into each other during the wetting process. To define the level of wetting, we characterized contact angles of aluminum droplets on alumina substrates for all temperatures and sizes. We quantified the size and temperatures dependence of contact angle.

In Experiment 1, the effect of the number of zygotes in a constant culture volume was investigated by culturing 1, 4 or 40 zygotes in 40 mul of culture medium. The cleavage rate was low with a single embryo (36 %) but increased with the number of embryos, to reach 50 % with 4 embryos/ 40 mul and 59 % with 40 embryos/ 40 mul. Blastocyst formation was nil with 1 embryo per 40 mul, reaching 2. 5 % with 4 embryos/ 40 mul and 18 % with 40 embryos/ 40 mul. The effect {{of the size of the}} drop was assessed in Experiment 2, the concentration of embryos remaining constant (1 embryo/ 1 mul). The volumes tested were 10, 20, 30 and 40 mul. Development into blastocysts increased gradually from 12 % in the 10 10 group to 20 % in the 40 40 group. Experiment 3 was designed to find a minimal droplet volume able to support the development of a single embryo to the blastocyst stage. The minimum tested volume was 5 mul and was not successful. These results show that bovine embryos cultured in oviduct-conditioned TCM 199 need to cooperate to reach the blastocyst stage. The mechanism of this cooperation is not known, but some autocrine/paracrine factors, probably growth factors, could promote embryo development as was demonstrated in mice.

40|$|The {{ever-increasing}} {{demand for}} higher I/O counts on chip requires the finer pitches {{to improve the}} performance, cost effectiveness and higher yield. The conventional under bump metallization (UBM) technology may not guarantee the required performance due to higher current density and diffusivity nowadays. In order to overcome these challenges, a UBM with higher strength and resistance to diffusion, better thermal and microstructural properties are required. Recently, nano reinforced Ni-P alloy {{has been identified as}} potential approach. Especially, the addition of Carbon nanotube (CNT) was expected to provide strengthening to the resulting UBM layers. CNTs have exceptional and attractive thermal, electrical, and mechanical properties, and are believed to be ideal material for fabricating composites. However, due to the large <b>surface</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio,</b> CNTs have strong tendency to agglomerate, which results in clusters. CNT clusters may lead to void formation and further cracking. Therefore, it is of great importance to figure out methods to disperse and incorporate CNTs into Ni-P UBM. In order to disperse carbon nano-tubes in electroless Ni-P coatings, two approaches were employed. Chemical modification, which includes acid oxidation treatment and surfactant treatment were conducted to disperse CNT clusters. Meanwhile, magnetic stirring and ultrasonic agitation were also employed to prepare the CNT/Ni-P composite coatings with CNTs homogeneously embedded. SEM and TEM were used to observe the dispersion after adopting the aforementioned treatment as well as the surface morphology of the deposited layers. It was verified that the dispersion can be significantly improved after proper treatment process, and surface of the CNT/Ni-P was quite smooth; CNTs were equably dispersed throughout the matrix. In addition, the interfacial bonding between CNTs and Ni-P coatings was good and firm. In these cases, an understanding {{of the effects of the}} acid oxidation, surfactant dispersant- magnetic stirring and ultrasonic agitation on CNT dispersion in both solution and deposited layer were ascertained...|$|E
40|$|Nanoscale {{architectures}} {{provide additional}} variables to engineer electronic/mechanical properties of material systems {{due to their}} high <b>surface</b> <b>volume</b> <b>ratio</b> and physics that arise from their extremely small size. To date, the device performance of microelectronics has been improved largely by miniaturization. However, with feature sizes below 100 nm, the fundamental challenges demand development of new architectures, new materials, and strain engineering. Strain engineering {{has been one of}} the most widely used techniques to achieve desired electronic properties of materials. For example, uniaxial compression and tension are desirable for high speed p-and n-MOSFET, respectively. However, accurate experimental characterization of strain in nanomaterials remains challenges such as resolving strain components and quantifying strain gradient which can affect electronic properties. Molecular dynamics (MD) describe materials with atomic resolution and it can provide invaluable information and insight into nanoscale strain engineering. MD simulations are used to study strain relaxation in Si/Ge heteroepitaxial structures of interest to nanoelectonic applications. ^ Nanopatterning is considered as an avenue for strain engineering to achieve uniaxial strain state from epitaxially integrated Si/Ge heterostructures. Using MD, it is studied how size affect strain relaxation on strained Si/Ge/Si nanobars representing the structures obtained by patterning the films in nanoscale. The MD results demonstrate that Ge with a roughly square cross section has a uniaxial strain state desirable for hole mobility enhancement. Also, process-induced strain relaxation on Si/Ge heterostructures is discussed. The simulations suggest that, by engineering the aspect ratio of Si/Ge nanolaminates, local amorphization followed by recrystallization can be used for either preserving the engineered strain or achieving the desired strain state in crystalline region, showing a possibility as a new avenue for strain engineering. Finally, MD is used to explore surface roughness effect on the coherency limit of Si-core/Ge-shell nanowires. Rough surface in the nanowires with larger core size promotes defect nucleation. After coherency loss, transverse strains along on the plane normal to the wire direction are relaxed regardless of core size and surface roughness. However, the axial strain relaxations is only observed in the nanowires with the highest surface roughness. The defects types responsible for the strain relaxation are also analyzed. ^ In summary, the MD simulation provides a lot of abilities to study materials behavior in nanoscale. Also, atomic level analysis such as local strain calculation and defects analysis help us to have physical insight of nanostructures to achieve the desired materials properties leading to maximized device performance. ...|$|E

Graphite oxide {{is a high}} modulus material that can be separated into thin layers with high surface area. The {{aim of this study}} is to prepare polymer layered graphite oxide composites using functionalised polyolefin to enhance compatibility with various forms of layered graphite oxide in varying concentration. Functionalised polyolefins reinforced with layered graphite oxides and expanded graphite oxides were prepared using solution blending and melt blending methods. Three different mixing methods with varying shear intensity were employed to prepare polymer layered graphite oxide composites. The crystalline structure, thermal and mechanical properties of the prepared polymer layered graphite oxide composites was studied. Oxidised graphite prepared from the Staudenmaier method and its exfoliated form were dispersed in poly(ethylene-co-methyl acrylate-co-acrylic acid) (EMAA) via solution blending to prepare EMAA layered composites. The thermal stability was determined using thermogravimetric analysis. The EMAA layered composites showed higher thermal stability in comparison with pure EMAA. The mechanical properties of these EMAA layered composites were determined through dynamic mechanical analysis. Shear modulus, yield stress and storage modulus of EMAA in the presence of graphite oxide fillers decreased. A solution blending method was used to prepare poly(propylene-grafted-maleic anhydride) layered expanded graphite oxide composites (PPMA-EGO). Two types of PPMA-EGO were prepared using different mixing methods - low and high shear were employed. The effects of preparative mixing methods on the PPMA-EGO properties were investigated. The mechanical properties of PPMA-EGO obtained from dynamic mechanical analysis indicated that EGO had a reinforcing effect on the elastic behaviour of PPMA-EGO. This is due to strong interfacial adhesion between PPMA and EGO as a result of hydrogen bonding. The elastic behaviour of PPMA-EGO was affected by the surface area of graphite flakes. Low sheared PPMA-EGO elastic behaviour was found to be higher compared with that of high sheared PPMA-EGO. A melt blending method was used to prepare PPMA-EGO with varying EGO concentration. The interconnected network structure of EGO in the PPMA-EGO was not observed as shown by its scanning electron microscopy images. Thermogravimetric analysis of PPMA-EGO indicates increased decomposition temperature of the PPMA matrix. Dynamic mechanical analysis showed enhanced storage modulus of PPMA-EGO. The maximum elastic modulus of PPMA-EGO was observed at 3 %wt of EGO. The electrical conductivity of PPMA-EGO was measured only for EGO concentrations above 2 %wt. The EGO concentration was found to be the most critical factor in the enhancement of the electrical conductivity of PPMA-EGO. Wide angle X-ray diffraction analysis of all polymer layered graphite oxide composites revealed no change in interlayer spacing of graphite layers, indicating the absence of EMAA intercalation in the graphite layers. The crystallisation temperature and crystallinity of all polymer layered graphite oxide composites were determined using differential scanning calorimetry. The results indicated that graphite oxide and expanded graphite oxides acted as nucleating agents in inducing the crystallisation of functionalised polyolefin in the layered composites. However, the degree of crystallinity of functionalised polyolefin decreased in the layered composites...|$|E
