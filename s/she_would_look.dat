25|$|He was {{appointed}} British vice-consul in 1842. While serving as vice-consul, he advocated {{the takeover of}} California by the British government; the proposal was flatly rejected. Forbes was informed that Great Britain {{had no desire to}} interfere in California politics, but that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> with great disfavor upon such interference by any other power. This sentiment was communicated to Thomas O. Larkin, United States consul, but did little to dissuade the U.S. from annexing California in 1846.|$|E
500|$|During the Presidential {{campaign}} of 1952, Pat Nixon's attitude toward politics changed {{when her husband}} was accused of accepting illegal campaign contributions. Pat encouraged him to fight the charges, and he did so by delivering the famed [...] "Checkers speech", so-called for the family's dog, a Cocker Spaniel given to them by a political supporter. This was Pat's first national television appearance, and she, her daughters, and the dog were featured prominently. Defending himself {{as a man of}} the people, Nixon stressed his wife's abilities as a stenographer, then said, [...] "I should say this, that Pat doesn't have a mink coat. But she does have a respectable Republican cloth coat, and I always tell her <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> good in anything." ...|$|E
500|$|I had two {{ideas that}} did not fit the song. She said no even though I had a very clear idea of how <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> in the video. I worked up on another idea and brought {{together}} a featured band for her to see. I did it all in front of me. [...] In retrospect, it feels good, the video we have done much better suited to the track than the first ideas. [...] has an incredible track on everything she is doing. Style, music, business— she has a mental track of every single thing and won't give up until she is completely satisfied. And on music videos there is nothing she does {{with one hand on}} her back— she's engaged to one hundred percent.|$|E
60|$|But if {{that was}} {{the truth of the matter}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have <b>looked</b> and behaved {{differently}} in court--quite differently. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> have been <b>looking</b> for him. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> have seen him....|$|R

500|$|Afterwards, Jack's {{secretary}} tells Liz that Jack {{wants her}} to apologize, but {{that she has to}} pretend that it was her idea. Liz goes to Jack's office and apologizes, and they forgive each other. While the staff eats their lunch, Jack introduces the staff to two of his guests. The writers mention to Liz that they would love to go outside to the same roof that is used for The Today Show, and Liz tells them that she can make it happen now that she and Jack are friends. Liz asks Jack, but he denies the request. He tells her that the two guests were his bosses from GE, and then criticizes Liz and her staff. He apologizes to Liz, but she says that their friendship is over. Having settled the situation with Jack, Liz tries to talk to her assistant Cerie about her attire, which seems to distract the writers. Liz attempts to convince her to wear something conservative, but Cerie tells Liz that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> great in something sexy herself, and Liz is later seen walking down the hallway with a dress that reads [...] "Dirty Diva".|$|E
500|$|Whitney {{was portrayed}} by Brook Kerr from the series' debut on July 5, 1999, to September 7, 2007. In 2005, Sidne Siobhan Phillips portrayed the {{character}} in flashbacks. Passions casting director Jacklynn Briskey originally rejected 26-year-old Brook Kerr {{for the role}} of Whitney, believing <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> too mature to play a teenager. Despite this decision, Kerr's husband Christopher Warren submitted his wife's head shots to the network and she was hired to play the character. Kerr later described the week of auditioning and two screen tests to be formally cast in the role as an extremely quick process. While discussing her portrayal of the character, Kerr said, [...] "I was always the sensible one, the friend everyone could count on, always doing what I should." [...] Over the course of the series, media outlets frequently speculated on the exact nature of Whitney's relationship with Chad. The incest storyline led media outlets to sensationalize Harmony as the place where [...] "half-siblings sleep with one another." [...] Soap Opera Digest listed the 2006 revelation that Whitney and Chad were not related by blood as one of Passions most shocking secrets.|$|E
500|$|The {{video is}} {{structured}} as a cinematic peep show and voyeurism that portrays Madonna as a stripper. According to Mondino, the peep show {{was his idea}} since at that time, [...] "we were into a period where we were experimenting [...] some kind of freedom about the body, about sexuality and stuff". He {{wanted to have a}} [...] "naive and sweet" [...] feel with the portrayal of a boy waiting outside for Madonna. They built the set from scratch, including the frontal part with the ticket booth. Although it looked fake, Mondino liked it saying [...] "I like the fakeness of it. I haven't seen it for a long time, but when I saw it once again, I said, 'It's so naïve'. It's kind of badly done, which I like, compared to today. We didn't have the same equipment, people are more skillful today, but there's something sweet about it." [...] Madonna was initially asked by him to wear a black wig, and the initial reaction to the whole wardrobe was positive. But Madonna wanted Mondino's opinion on the whole ensemble, who replied that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> better as a blonde. So the wig was kept for the initial scenes of the video only.|$|E

6000|$|Anne {{stood there}} {{the rest of}} the {{afternoon}} with that legend above her. She did not cry or hang her head. Anger was still too hot in her heart for that and it sustained her amid all her agony of humiliation. With resentful eyes and passion-red cheeks she confronted alike Diana's sympathetic gaze and Charlie Sloane's indignant nods and Josie Pye's malicious smiles. As for Gilbert Blythe, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not even <b>look</b> at him. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> NEVER <b>look</b> at him again! <b>She</b> <b>would</b> never speak to him!! ...|$|R
500|$|On {{the seventh}} {{season of the}} popular talent {{competition}} American Idol, Carey was featured as a mentor for the top-seven week. Titled [...] "Mariah Carey Week" [...] and airing live on April 14, 2008, the contestants were to perform a song from Carey's catalog. After all seven contestants sang their individual songs, they all came together for a live rendition of Carey's 1996 collaboration with Boyz II Men, [...] "One Sweet Day". Overall, critics noted how a Carey themed week would be extremely difficult for the performers, due to their vocally strenuous nature. Following their joint performance, Carey emerged onto the stage in a black mini-dress, and performed [...] "Bye Bye" [...] live, while backed by a trio of supporting vocalists. Tamara Jones of The Washington Post jokingly commented on Carey's flailing hand movements during the performance, writing how she was [...] "waving like a malevolent homecoming queen". Gil Kaufman from MTV News complimented Carey's performance, commenting on her [...] "barely there micro-dress" [...] and writing how she [...] "serenaded the audience with her homage to lost ones." [...] The Calgary Suns Lindsey Ward {{described it as a}} [...] "less-than-fab performance", although complimenting on Carey's leaner figure, [...] "Oh, who am I kidding? <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> hot in a paper bag." ...|$|E

In order to let the sound engineer know of the problem, she substituted part of the lyrics for [...] "stop singing my part now baby", and completed the final chorus. She continued on with [...] "I'm That Chick", and completed the three-song set-list with her follow-up single, [...] "Bye Bye". After marking the album's stateside launch with her appearance on Good Morning America, Carey took to Europe to perform on several programs.

2500|$|LOCOG's Director of Sport, Debbie Jevans {{declared}} herself {{pleased with}} the event. However, in her debrief with the UCI she said <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> at comments from riders, {{the impact of the}} full road closures along the route and the crowd restrictions on Box Hill. Jevans said that consensus was that it was a 'fantastic' course which was 'technically challenging.' However, riders complained about parts of {{the first part of the}} course; Dumoulin commenting that it was [...] "a little dangerous." [...] The Director also noted that the a section of the Box Hill area would be widened. As for the limited crowd of 3,400 on Box Hill, Jevans stated that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> into trying to increase the capacity on that section as an estimated 100,000 people turned out to watch the event in total. Pat McQuaid, president of the UCI, was impressed by the spectator turnout.|$|E

2500|$|Inevitably, Nora Aunor {{went on to}} do films when Dr. Jose Perez of Sampaguita Pictures asked comedian German Moreno to ask Nora if {{she would}} like to try acting.

On October 2, 1967, Aunor signed an eight-picture non-exclusive contract with Sampaguita Pictures, with the assurance that she would be given a singing part. [...] Aunor made several youth-oriented films like All Over World and Way Out of the Country.|$|E
2500|$|Producer Melissa Cobb {{said that}} {{originally}} Po was [...] "more of a jerk," [...] {{but that the}} character changed after they heard Jack Black.

Lucy Liu said that the film [...] "was quite different because {{it was such a}} long process." [...] Liu said that when she was presented with the project they already had artwork of her character as well as a [...] "short computerized video version of what <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>look</b> like when she moved." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bessie was a {{key partner}} in her husband's work, {{supporting}} him and his students and opening her home to the many people who sought her husband's counsel.
