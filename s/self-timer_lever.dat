50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{variations}} of the Leica M2. Although most models have the <b>self-timer</b> <b>lever,</b> it is absent from some earlier models. Also, some early models have a film rewind push-button instead of the typical lever. About 2400 M2s were factory-painted black, but these are relatively rare and more valued by collectors. Near the end of production, Leica also produced a number of M2-R models, which had the faster loading system of the later Leica M4.|$|E
50|$|The Minolta SR-2 was {{presented}} in 1958 as the first 35mm SLR camera from Chiyoda Kogaku. Popular cameras of this type at that time were mainly from Europe but a few from Japan, including the Asahi Pentax, the Miranda T and the Topcon R. The miniature SLR camera concept was conceived in the 1930s at Ihagee in Dresden, resulting in the 1936 Kine Exakta. Influential cameras designs {{like that of the}} 1939 KW Praktiflex, the 1949 ZI Contax S, and 1952 the KW Praktina marked the steady progress toward a perfected SLR. Several features of the latter seem to have influenced the design of the SR-2 although dissimilar in many respects. The obvious similarities are the stepped top plate, the carrying strap lugs, the <b>self-timer</b> <b>lever</b> and some general body features.|$|E
5000|$|The Autoreflex T3 is an {{improved}} Autoreflex T2, It adds an aperture-stop-down (depth-of-field preview) function to the <b>self-timer</b> <b>lever</b> (push lever towards lens for stop-down, push button on lever-hub and turn lever counter-clockwise {{to set the}} self-timer), a Multiple Exposure (M.E.) switch integrated with the shutter-speed dial used {{in combination with the}} cocking-indicator (indicator green means shutter is cocked, red means it isn't), as well as a wider range of selectable film-speeds (ISO 12 - 3200). As with the T2, both the aperture and shutter speed setting are visible in the viewfinder, which has improved brightness compared to earlier models. This model has its serial-number engraved in the top-plate's rear below the wind-lever and a stamped and painted [...] "T-3" [...] between the rewind-lever and prism-bump on the top (note the dash here vs. no dash {{on the front of the}} camera).|$|E
50|$|Next to be {{introduced}} was the F3P in 1983. Built primarily for use by photojournalists ("P"ress), the F3P included additional weathersealing, O-ring gaskets, the MF-6 Auto Film-Stop Back, Type-B Matte focusing screen, a modified Titanium DE-5 pentaprism with ISO-type accessory shoe and no eyepiece blind, rubber-covered waterproof shutter release with a modified lockout and no cable release threads, a round frame counter window with white numerals (some have been seen with blue numerals), and an extended shutter speed operating knob for easier operation in cold or wet environments. The F3P lacked a film door release lock, <b>self-timer</b> and multiple-exposure <b>lever.</b>|$|R
50|$|The stop-down lever at the {{right-hand}} camera front also operates the <b>self-timer.</b> Pushing the <b>lever</b> towards the lens activates the stop down match-needle meter, while pulling {{in the opposite}} direction winds the timer. As with the Canon FX and FP, the camera back is opened turning a key at the base. The film speed is set lifting and turning the rim of the shutter speed dial. The camera is designed for the obsolete 1.35 volt mercury battery, which fortunately may be directly replaced by a similar 1.4 volt hearing aid battery, it is usable for about a year after activation whether used or not. The battery compartment is at the left-hand edge of the camera, next to the rewind knob. The Pellix was replaced by the improved Canon Pellix QL first marketed in March 1966. Improvements included the addition of a quick film loading mechanism and contacts in the base of the battery compartment for a separately available electronic booster for the internal exposure meter.|$|R
