40|$|The {{presented}} cloud-computing portal allows automated imaging of near-surface structures {{either in}} full-precision using a global simultaneous {{search for the}} best fitting spatial CRS stacking operator or in real-time using a pragmatic sequence of line searches. The simultaneous search even though computationally very expensive becomes necessary when the pragmatic search fails due to strongly varying velocities, low CMP fold and high noise levels. In our first case study we apply real-time imaging by reprocessing multi-offset Ground Penetrating-Radar data with a good signal/noise ratio. Generating stacked and prestack time migrated sections, consistent with conventional results, required less than 10 minutes. In our second case study we analyze a challenging SH-wave seismic reflection data, recorded in an urban environment, where {{a high level of}} ambient noise and landfills below the sealed surface down to 2 m depth resulting from recent reconstruction work hampered seismic data quality severely. Here, we successfully applied our newly developed full-precision CRS imaging approach in addition to conventional CMP <b>stack</b> <b>aided</b> by VSP. In this urban environment, the relevance of applying both, high resolution SH-wave seismic and VSP surveys was demonstrated. Two recently drilled wells confirm the aquiclude to be found as predicted by the seismic forecast...|$|R
30|$|Individual data {{choices are}} split into three primary categories: directional, RPI, and rock {{magnetic}} data (Figure 6). These splits {{are motivated by}} current research interests within paleomagnetism and rock magnetism. For example, RPI data alone {{can be used to}} improve our understanding of the paleomagnetic power spectrum (Figure 1), and compilations of RPI data have been used to construct global and regional paleointensity <b>stacks</b> to <b>aid</b> in stratigraphic studies and to help in defining the global character of the geomagnetic field (see the ‘Introduction’ section). Being able to filter out studies with no RPI data greatly increases the efficiency of these types of analyzes.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two classes}} of pieces: men and kings. Men are single pieces. Kings consist of two men of the same colour, stacked {{one on top of}} the other. The bottom piece is {{referred}} to as crowned (or kinged in the U.S.). Some sets have pieces with a crown molded, engraved or painted on one side, allowing the player to simply turn the piece over or to place the crown-side up on the crowned man, further differentiating kings from men. Pieces are often manufactured with indentations to <b>aid</b> <b>stacking.</b>|$|R
30|$|Over {{the last}} 15 years, {{relative}} paleointensity data {{have been used}} to construct global and regional paleointensity <b>stacks</b> to <b>aid</b> in stratigraphic studies (e.g., Simon et al. 2012) and to broadly characterize the global geomagnetic field, including the field over the past 50 ka (e.g., SINT- 800 (Guyodo and Valet 1999 b); SINT- 2000 (Valet et al. 2005); NAPIS (Laj et al. 2000); SAPIS (Stoner et al. 2002); GLOPIS (Laj et al. 2004); PISO- 1500 (Channell et al. 2009); NOPAPIS- 250 (Yamamoto et al. 2007); and PADM 2 M (Ziegler et al. 2011)). Roberts et al. 2013 noted non-trivial differences between some stacks for the past 40 ka and stated these differences were outside measurement errors or errors of the stacking procedures. The provision of a substantial amount of relative paleointensity and chronological data will allow refinement of such stacks over the past 50 ka, and corresponding rock magnetic data may aid in understanding if remanence acquisition processes vary among sediments from different environments.|$|R

The sulfoxide O atom is in a pseudo-axial {{position on the}} thiazine ring and is trans to the phenyl group on C- 2. The phenyl rings form a dihedral angle of 89. 47  (19) °. In this racemate crystal, homochiral molecules form slabs parallel to (010) of thickness b/ 2 which then stack with alternating chirality in the b-axis direction. The <b>stacking</b> is <b>aided</b> by edge-to-face interactions between the phenyl rings of racemic molecules. Within each of the single-enantiomer slabs, the molecules are held by C—H [...] .

40|$|An absorbing-layer-stack model allows {{quantitative}} {{analysis of the}} light flux in flowers and the resulting reflectance spectra. It provides insight in how plants can optimize their flower coloration for attracting pollinators. The coloration of flowers {{is due to the}} combined effect of pigments and light-scattering structures. To interpret flower coloration, we applied an optical model that considers a flower as a stack of layers, where each layer can be treated with the Kubelka-Munk theory for diffusely scattering and absorbing media. We applied our model to the flowers of the Chilean Bellflower, Nolana paradoxa, which have distinctly different-colored adaxial and abaxial sides. We found that the flowers have a pigmented, strongly scattering upper layer, in combination with an unpigmented, moderately reflecting lower layer. The model allowed quantitative interpretation of the reflectance and transmittance spectra measured with an integrating sphere. The absorbance spectrum of the pigment measured with a microspectrophotometer confirmed the spectrum derived by modeling. We discuss how different pigment localizations yield different reflectance spectra. The absorbing layer <b>stack</b> model <b>aids</b> in understanding the various constraints and options for plants to tune their coloration...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] After 40 {{years of}} evolution, the series {{thyristor}} (SCR) stack remains the valve-of-choice for multi-megawatt {{applications such as}} solid-state transfer switches, motor soft starters, VAR compensators and high-energy physics. However, the SCR's enduring popularity resulted in an almost overwhelming number of gate-firing methods — at least ten widely used methods for medium voltage series <b>stacks</b> alone. To <b>aid</b> the engineer during the initial design or specification stage, a survey is made of the three fundamental series SCR gate drive topologies and their most common variants, including floating bias drivers, MV pulse transformers and light triggered designs. The advantages, limitations and inherent features of several methods are described and compared with the competing methods. Methods are also compared against established electrical requirements for gate triggering, discussed in the appendix, "Firing Series SCRs.

40|$|Combined {{capillary}} electrophoresis-time-of-flight {{mass spectrometry}} (CE-ToF-MS) {{is a powerful}} technique for the fast and efficient analysis of ionogenic compounds. The application of CE-ToF-MS to metabolic profiling of body fluids, however, may be hindered by reproducibility and coverage problems. In this thesis a novel approach for reproducible and comprehensive metabolic profiling by CE-ToF-MS is presented. Very stable CE performance is accomplished {{by the use of}} noncovalent capillary coatings comprised of double and triple layers of charged polymers. These easy-to-produce coatings provide high migration-time reproducibility and good tolerance against sample matrix compounds. Moreover, one capillary with different coatings can be used for both cationic and anionic compounds demonstrating the flexibility of this approach for providing an extended coverage of metabolites in only two CE runs. Incorporation of in-capillary preconcentration by pH-mediated <b>stacking</b> further <b>aids</b> the detection of low-level metabolites. The performance of this novel CE-ToF-MS platform for metabolic profiling of body fluids has been studied for large groups of urine samples. Using multivariate techniques, it is demonstrated that the CE-ToF-MS platform allows high quality metabolomic data to be obtained. Accordingly, it can be applied for delineation of the urinary metabolome in a clinical setting. For example, the applicability and usefulness of the CE-ToF-MS platform will be outlined by the elucidation of metabolites involved in complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and urinary tract infection (UTI). Multivariate statistical analysis of the recorded profiles revealed biomarker candidates, which were subsequently identified by accurate mass and/or MS-MS using QToF-MS...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{stacking}} of end {{groups on the}} rheol. behavior of supramol. polymer melts is reported. Oscillatory shear expts. in the transition zone from the pseudo rubber plateau to the flow region of telechelic polycaprolactones (PCLs) with ureidopyrimidinone (UPy) end groups directly attached to PCL can be fitted with a single Maxwell element. This demonstrates that dimerization of the UPy groups is unidirectional and that reversible chain scission is faster than reptation. If the UPy groups {{are connected to the}} polymer via a urethane linker, a low-frequency plateau in G' is obsd. This is ascribed to the formation of a network of <b>stacked</b> UPy dimers, <b>aided</b> by urethane hydrogen bonding. Below their m. p., these stacks form long fibers in the urethane linked supramol. poly(Me caprolactone), which were obsd. with at. force microscopy (AFM). Steric hindrance interferes with stacking, since the plateau in G' is lower in a urethane linked polymer with bulky adamantyl-UPy end groups...|$|R
40|$|Glycolipid {{transfer}} proteins (GLTPs) are small, soluble {{proteins that}} selectively accelerate the intermembrane transfer of glycolipids. The GLTP fold is conformationally unique among lipid binding/transfer proteins {{and serves as}} the prototype and {{founding member of the}} new GLTP superfamily. In the present study, changes in human GLTP tryptophan fluorescence, induced by membrane vesicles containing glycolipid, are shown to reflect glycolipid binding when vesicle concentrations are low. Characterization of the glycolipid-induced “signature response,” i. e. ∼ 40 % decrease in Trp intensity and ∼ 12 -nm blue shift in emission wavelength maximum, involved various modes of glycolipid presentation, i. e. microinjection/dilution of lipid-ethanol solutions or phosphatidylcholine vesicles, prepared by sonication or extrusion and containing embedded glycolipids. High resolution x-ray structures of apo- and holo-GLTP indicate that major conformational alterations are not responsible for the glycolipid-induced GLTP signature response. Instead, glycolipid binding alters the local environment of Trp- 96, which accounts for ∼ 70 % of total emission intensity of three Trp residues in GLTP and provides a <b>stacking</b> platform that <b>aids</b> formation of a hydrogen bond network with the ceramide-linked sugar of the glycolipid headgroup. The changes in Trp signal were used to quantitatively assess human GLTP binding affinity for various lipids including glycolipids containing different sugar headgroups and homogenous acyl chains. The presence of the glycolipid acyl chain and at least one sugar were essential for achieving a low-to-submicromolar dissociation constant that was only slightly altered by increased sugar headgroup complexity...|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is not conventionally air conditioned because {{the production of}} the electricity used to make and operate air conditioners has an environmental impact, including the release of greenhouse gasses. Instead, air flows around the perimeter of The Hive through opening windows. Air makes its way towards the main atrium and other voids where it rises to roof level and is exhausted through the roof vents. The seven roof-mounted cones encourage the upward movement of stale air by <b>stack</b> effect, mechanically <b>aided</b> a large below-ground duct which supplies air naturally {{to the bottom of the}} main atrium space. To safeguard against contra-flows created by external wind turbulence, which might negate this stack effect, the architects commissioned a scale model of one of the cones to be tested in a wind tunnel at Cardiff University.The predominant wind direction is from the South-West which means that air is blown over the river and the water meadow provided as part of the landscape in front of the building. There is some degree of evaporative cooling which reduces the air-temperature of the incoming air.Exposed concrete soffits provide the majority of the thermal mass and these are pre-cooled by the night-time cooling strategy. In very hot weather when the natural ventilation can no longer maintain the required conditions, cool water (fed by the river cooling system) is circulated around either chilled beams or pipes embedded in the concrete slab to provide further cooling.|$|R
40|$|Friction {{and wear}} {{mitigation}} is typically accomplished by introducing a shear accommodating layer (e. g., {{a thin film}} of liquid) between surfaces in sliding and/or rolling contacts. When the operating conditions are beyond the liquid realm, attention turns to solid coatings. Solid lubricants {{have been widely used}} in governmental and industrial applications for mitigation of wear and friction (tribological properties). Conventional examples of solid lubricants are MoS 2, WS 2, h-BN, and graphite; however, these and some others mostly perform best only for a limited range of operating conditions, e. g. ambient air versus dry nitrogen and room temperature versus high temperatures. Conversely, lubricious oxides have been studied lately as good potential candidates for solid lubricants because they are thermodynamically stable and environmentally robust. Oxide surfaces are generally inert and typically do not form strong adhesive bonds like metals/alloys in tribological contacts. Typical of these oxides is ZnO. The interest in ZnO is due to its potential for utility in a variety of applications. To this end, nanolaminates of ZnO, Al 2 O 3, ZrO 2 thin films have been deposited at varying sequences and thicknesses on silicon substrates and high temperature (M 50) bearing steels by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The top lubricious, nanocrystalline ZnO layer was structurally-engineered to achieve low surface energy { 0002 }-orientated grain that provided low sliding friction coefficients (0. 2 to 0. 3), wear factors (range of 10 - 7 to 10 - 8 mm 3 /Nm) and good rolling contact fatigue resistance. The Al 2 O 3 was intentionally made amorphous to achieve the { 0002 } preferred orientation while { 101 }-orientated tetragonal ZrO 2 acted as a high toughness/load bearing layer. It was determined that the ZnO defective structure (oxygen sub-stoichiometric with growth <b>stacking</b> faults) <b>aided</b> in shear accommodation by re-orientating the nanocrystalline grains where they realigned to create new friction-reducing surfaces. Specifically, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) inside the wear surfaces revealed in an increase in both partial dislocation and basal stacking fault densities through intrafilm shear/slip of partial dislocations on the (0002) planes via a dislocation glide mechanism. This shear accommodation mode mitigated friction and prevented brittle fracture classically observed in higher friction microcrystalline and single crystal ZnO that has potential broad implications to other defective nanocrystalline ceramics. Overall, this work has demonstrated that environmentally-robust, lubricious ALD nanolaminates of ZnO/Al 2 O 3 /ZrO 2 are good candidates for providing low friction and wear interfaces in moving mechanical assembles, such as fully assembled rolling element bearings and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) that require thin (~ 10 - 200 nm), uniform and conformal films...|$|R
40|$|The polymer {{electrolyte}} membrane {{fuel cell}} (PEMFC) is an electrochemical device {{used for the}} production of power, which is a key for the transition towards green and renewable power delivery devices for mobile, stationary and back-up power applications. PEMFCs consume hydrogen and oxygen to produce power, water and heat. The transient start-up from sub-zero freezing temperature conditions is a problem for the successful, undamaged and unhindered operation. The generation and presence of water in the PEMFC stack in such an environment leads to the formation of ice that hinders the flow of gases, causes morphological changes in the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) leading to reversible and irreversible degradation of stack performance. Start-up performance is highly dependent on start-up operational conditions and procedures. The previous state of the stack will influence the ability to perform upon the next start-up and operation. Water generated during normal operation is vital and improves performance when properly managed. Liquid water present at shut-down can form ice and cause unwanted start-up effects. This phase change may cause damage to the MEA and gas diffusion media due to volume expansion. Removal of high water content at shutdown decreases proton conductivity which can delay start-up times. The United States Department of Energy (DOE) has established a set of criteria that will make fuel cell technology viable when attained. As specified by DOE, an 80 kWe fuel cell will be required by 2015 to reach 50 % power in 30 seconds from start-up at an ambient temperature of - 20 °C. This work investigates freeze start-up in a multi-kilowatt stack approaching both shut-down conditioning and start-up operations to improve performance, moderate fuel cell damage and determine the limits of current stack technology. The investigation involved a Hydrogenics Corporation 5 kW 506 series fuel cell stack. The investigation is completed through conditioning the fuel cell start-up performance at various temperatures ranging from - 5 °C to below - 20 °C. The control of system start-up temperature is achieved with an environmental chamber that maintains the desired set point during dwell time and start-up. The supply gases for the experiment are conditioned at ambient stack temperature to create a realistic environment that could be experienced in colder weather climates. Temperature controls aim to maintain steady ambient temperatures during progressive start-up in order to best simulate ambient conditions. The control and operation of the fuel cell is maintained by the use of a fuel cell automated test station (FCATS™). FCATS supplies gas feeds, coolant medium and can control temperature and reactant humidity in reactants according to a prescribed procedure for continuous operation. The iv collection of data occurs by the same system recording cell voltage, temperatures, pressures, flow rates and current densities. A procedural start-up and characterization are conducted in order improve start-of performance and examine reactant flows, coolant activation time, stack conditioning and the effects by freezing temperatures. The resulting degradation is investigated by polarization curves and various ex-situ measurements. In this work, it was found that freeze start-up of a fuel cell <b>stack</b> can be <b>aided</b> and managed by conditioning the stack at shut-down and applying a procedure to successfully start-up and mitigate the damage that freezing can cause...|$|R
