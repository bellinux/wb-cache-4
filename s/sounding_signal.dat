The performance of such radar depends {{of the level of}} <b>sounding</b> <b>signals</b> orthogonality. In the main operational mode, the radar will be used for atmospheric remote sensing and polarimetric studies of ground-based targets. In such mode it will use a pair of synchronous linearly- frequency modulated (LFM) continuous signals with opposite frequency excursions of 50 MHz and duration of 1 ms. Such a combination of <b>sounding</b> <b>signals</b> has limited orthogonality even for huge BT-products, which produce cross-channel interferences. These interferences in case of radar scene with multiple pointed and distributed targets can completely degrade radar operational performance. In this article, we propose simple and effective technique to suppress interferences and to restore radar performance. The technique has been tested using simulation and has been implemented in multi-channel digital receiver of the PARSAX radar. The real radar measurements presented to illustrate effectiveness of cross-channel interferences suppression. The proposed technique can be useful not only for polarimetric radar design, but also in much wide radar applications, which use waveforms with high orthogonality.

30|$|In this contribution, a {{high-resolution}} {{parameter estimation}} algorithm is derived {{based on the}} Space-Alternating Generalized Expectation-maximization (SAGE) principle for extracting multipath parameters from the output of sliding correlator (SC). The SC allows calculating channel impulse responses with a sampling rate less than that required by Nyquist criterion, and hence is widely used in real-time wideband (e.g., > 500 MHz) channel sounding for the fifth generation wireless communication scenarios. However, since the <b>sounding</b> <b>signal</b> needs to be sent repetitively, the SC-based solution is unacceptable for time-variant channel measurements. The algorithm proposed here estimates multipath parameters by using a parametric model of both low- and high-frequency components of the SC’s output. The latter was considered as distortions and discarded in the conventional SC-based channel sounding. The new algorithm allows estimating path parameters with less repetitions of transmitting the <b>sounding</b> <b>signal</b> and still exhibits higher estimation accuracy than the conventional method. Simulations are conducted and illustrate the root mean square estimation errors and the resolution capability of the proposed algorithm {{with respect to the}} bandwidth and the length of the SC’s output. These studies pave the way for measuring time-variant wideband propagation channels using SC-based solutions.|$|E
