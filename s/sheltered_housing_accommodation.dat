50|$|There {{has been}} {{significant}} {{development in the}} village {{in the last few}} decades. The population had declined from 410 at the 1891 census to 331 in 1971 increasing to 574 in 1981, 652 in 1991, 766 in 2001 (all census figures) and to 828 in the 2011 census. This increase was in no small way due {{to the development of the}} Hall Road and Two Fields Way area plus Paradise Road. Since 2000 the developments at Saxon Meadows, All Saint's Court and Chaucers Heath (Reeve's Close) plus other infill have added at least 24 new houses and the redevelopment of the <b>sheltered</b> <b>housing</b> <b>accommodation</b> at Folland Court completed in August 2009 has seen eight larger family houses built. There is considerable opposition within the village to any further large scale development, especially of sixty or so houses on the site near Two Fields Way proposed by the 'Gladedale Group', expressed at the Annual Parish Meeting in May 2007, and the draft Breckland Local Development Framework (LDF) has not listed Bawdeswell for any significant development.

40|$|For {{some years}} now, the UK {{government}} have discouraged any {{further development of}} <b>sheltered</b> <b>housing</b> schemes. Older people are living longer and their expectation and lifestyle are changing. They are also seeking sheltered home appropriate to their circumstances. The growing importance of housing provision {{for the elderly and}} the increasing needs and expectations of the elderly for improved housing provisions are becoming ever more pressing. Increasingly, <b>sheltered</b> <b>housing</b> providers are faced with issues of difficult to let housing stock. Also, concerns have been raised within the housing industry on the falling demands for small bedsit units. These small size bedsits were a significant part of <b>sheltered</b> <b>housing</b> provision dating back to 1960 s and 1970 s.

40|$|Aims: A {{cross-sectional}} study was undertaken among elderly men living alone in Sunderland to (1) assess their dietary intake and food habits, (2) to identify factors which influence their food choice, and (3) to investigate perceived needs regarding nutrition education activities. Methods: A {{random sample of}} 66 men, aged 70 years and over was drawn from members of luncheon clubs (n= 33) and residents of <b>sheltered</b> <b>housing</b> <b>accommodation</b> (n= 33). Dietary intake was assessed using a validated semi-quantified food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Results: Intake of all nutrients, {{with the exception of}} energy, vitamin D and fibre was adequate. Almost half of the subjects (47 %) had energy intakes below the EAR, and the majority tended towards underweight, as indicated by the age-adjusted reference standards for BMI. Taste and enjoyment were the factors which most influenced food choice. The main identified source of nutrition information was the media, followed by relatives and friends. Only half of the subjects perceived that they would benefit from nutrition education and 58 % reported a willingness to participate in such activities if they were available. Conclusion: The findings suggest that although most subjects were aware of the role of dietary factors in the maintenance of an optimal health status, this age group is not a receptive audience for nutrition education activities. The targeting of elderly men living alone presents a challenge to nutrition educators...|$|E
40|$|This study {{consists}} of an inquiry into whether reminiscing and related characteristics, notably the concept of life reviewing, appear adaptive features of the aging process, as has been suggested in the recent literature. The {{attempt was made to}} produce more thorough evidence for this question than previous studies, firstly by obtaining more individually sensitive measures of losses incurred in old age, and using person subjective but carefully monitored indices of adjustment. The analysis was performed on forty eight subjects (aged 68 - 92 yrs. of mean age 80 yrs.) living alone in <b>sheltered</b> <b>housing</b> <b>accommodation</b> in five London boroughs. Reminiscing, life reviewing, and use of the past in general attitudinal and informative conversation were quantified by obtaining one hour recordings of the subjects' conversations with the author in a naturalistic setting and performing a rigorous procedure of analysis on the transcripts of same. Reliability over time was demonstrated for each of the categories. Affect of reminiscing was also noted and a measure obtained of satisfaction with past life. Subjects were rated as well on their conversation over the whole time period of visiting (averaging six visits per person over two years). An examination of the results revealed that life reviewing, defined in this study by the willingness of the subject in his reminiscing to engage in interpretations and evaluations of his past self and expressions of his past subjective states, did indeed appear related to adjustment for subjects who indicated dissatisfaction with their past lives. Past life satisfaction and affect of reminiscing emerged as general adaptive factors, independent of any effect of presently incurred loss upon them. An ability to reminisce when provoked seems to be an adaptive characteristic of old age, and avoidance of an unpleasant past a maladaptive one. <p...|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} this Bachelor essay is <b>Sheltered</b> <b>housing</b> for old people - new chance for good quality life in old age". <b>Sheltered</b> <b>housing</b> is a long term {{residential}} service provided to seniors or disabled people, who need help of others in their situation. This service enables such people relatively independent life in common environment of their own household. St. Francis´s House in Veselí nad Lužnicí has been taken as a model example of <b>sheltered</b> <b>housing</b> for old people. The theoretical section includes detail description of this service. One of the objectives of this essay was to identify level of public awareness on the social service called <b>Sheltered</b> <b>Housing</b> for Seniors. Based on the specified objective the following hypothesis has been suggested for the quantitative research: Awareness of 55 + generation on residential service called <b>Sheltered</b> <b>Housing</b> for Seniors is low. This hypothesis has been confirmed. Another objective was to map <b>Sheltered</b> <b>Housing</b> for Seniors social service, in particular offers of activity programs and their utilization by house residents. This objective also considers satisfaction of the users with such offered activities. The following hypothesis has been formulated {{on the basis of}} data collected during qualitative research: Satisfaction of seniors with the offer of activity programs in the <b>sheltered</b> <b>house</b> is high. Asking questions has been determined as the most suitable method of quantitative research. The applied data collection technique was a questionnaire.

40|$|The {{right to}} {{self-determination}} is perhaps taken for granted by most people, but there are in fact scientific studies that show faults in self-determination for elderly people living in a <b>sheltered</b> <b>housing.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine how staff working in <b>sheltered</b> <b>housing</b> percieve self-determination, and how they think it can be encouraged for the elderly living there. A qualitative research method has been used where ten interviews have been conducted during spring of 2016. The results show that the staff thought self-determination was something very important, and that the elderly people living in <b>sheltered</b> <b>housing</b> should have influence over the overall daily life. The staff further described different types of complexities when it comes to selfdetermination, where the elderly living in <b>sheltered</b> <b>housing</b> at times had their selfdetermination limited or denied. This could be the direct effect of either their disease or the staff`s lack of time. Furthermore the result in this study shows that the staff viewed individualization as self-determination for the elderly living in <b>sheltered</b> <b>housing.</b> Skill development and the staff itself, through treatment and being present in the moment, where viewed as ways to enhance self-determination.

40|$|Abstract <b>Sheltered</b> <b>housing</b> for {{the elderly}} is an {{intermediate}} type of housing, between living in ones own home and living in an institution. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the changes in physical, cognitive and psychological abilities among the elderly living in <b>sheltered</b> <b>housing</b> during a two-year follow-up period. In this study psychological abilities were represented by depressive symptoms. The changes in the abilities of the elderly people living in <b>sheltered</b> <b>housing</b> were compared with the corresponding changes among the elderly living in their own homes. Furthermore, the associated factors and the predictors of the decline in physical and cognitive abilities, as well as the depressive symptoms were examined. The control group consisted of elderly people who were matched with those living in <b>sheltered</b> <b>housing</b> in regard to age, sex, coping with activities of daily living and depressive symptoms. The data of this study were collected among elderly people living in 20 units of <b>sheltered</b> <b>housing</b> in Finland in 1994 and 1996. 725 residents were interviewed and 340 re-interviewed after two years. Cognitive capacity was assessed with the help of the Mini-Mental Examination test (MMSE). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the shortened version of the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale (ZSDS). The results showed that the elderly living in <b>sheltered</b> <b>housing</b> were widows or widowers and lived alone more often than the home-dwelling elderly. They perceived their health as poorer, had less contacts with other people and had fewer hobbies than the elderly living at home. Nevertheless, they felt less lonely and were more satisfied with their lives than those living at home. During the two-year follow-up period the decline in the functional capacity of the elderly living in <b>sheltered</b> <b>housing</b> did not essentially differ from the corresponding change among the home-dwelling elderly. The decline in physical and psychological abilities among the elderly living in <b>sheltered</b> <b>housing</b> was similar to the decline among those living at home. Even if the decline in cognitive abilities among the elderly living in <b>sheltered</b> <b>housing</b> was more rapid than the change among the home-dwelling elderly, the difference between the groups was slight. Living in <b>sheltered</b> <b>housing</b> appeared to have neither a negative nor a positive effect on the functional capacity of the elderly. The predictors of the physical decline among the elderly living in <b>sheltered</b> <b>housing</b> were a high age, poor physical abilities at baseline, a high number of depressive symptoms, the use of medication and a low number of hobbies. The predictors of the physical decline among the home-dwelling elderly were the female sex, a high age, poor physical abilities at baseline, a high number of depressive symptoms, health perceived as poor and low social participation. The predictors of the decline in cognitive abilities among the elderly living in <b>sheltered</b> <b>housing</b> included a high age, poor cognitive abilities at baseline, poor education, dissatisfaction with life and health perceived as good. Among the home-dwelling elderly the predictors of the decline in cognitive abilities were poor cognitive abilities at baseline and a low number of hobbies. Among the elderly living in <b>sheltered</b> <b>housing</b> the predictors of depressive symptoms included a high number of depressive symptoms at baseline, poor cognitive abilities, health perceived as poor, a high number of feelings of loneliness, a low number of visits paid to other people and high education.
