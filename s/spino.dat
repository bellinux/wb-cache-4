500|$|Sniper Wolf {{was also}} {{acclaimed}} {{as one of}} the best boss type and antagonist characters in the Metal Gear series or even in all video games. In 2006, Ryan Stewart and Rich Krpata of The Boston Phoenix ranked the fight against Sniper Wolf as the 16th greatest boss battle in video game history, describing her as the best aspect of FOXHOUND and her death as [...] "one of gaming's most poignant scenes." [...] In 2008, readers of IGN voted her at the top position on the list of the Metal Gear series villains, the staff commenting: [...] "Who else could number one be but the incredibly beautiful, and impossibly deadly, Sniper Wolf?" [...] and adding that [...] "it's safe to say Wolf earned more votes than just about every other villain combined, a fact that doesn't surprise us at all." [...] That same year, IGN PlayStation Team ranked the fight against her as the sixth best boss battle in the series, while the staff of GameSpy placed her seventh on their list. In 2010, the staff of IGN ranked Sniper Wolf as the 92nd top video game villain of all time, stating that she [...] "probably deserves to be higher on our list" [...] and emphasizing the feeling of helplessness caused by her tactics in [...] "an epic boss battle". In 2015, she was included on several lists of the best boss fights in the Metal Gear series, including by Sean Garmer of 411mania, Dustin <b>Spino</b> of Cinelinx, and the staff of IGN, chosen by Zach Ryan.|$|E

50|$|In {{humans and}} other mammals, neurons in the PMC send {{descending}} excitatory projections to spinally located parasympathetic neurons controlling the detrusor muscle of the bladder and inhibitory interneurons regulating Onuf's nucleus. Additionally, the PMC receives ascending {{input from the}} level of the lumbosacral spinal cord. During bladder filling, neurons within the PMC are turned off. However, at a critical level of bladder distention the afferent information arising from mechanoreceptors in the detrusor switches the PMC on and enhances its activity. This activation results in relaxation of the male or female external urethral sphincter and contraction of the bladder. While operating as a <b>spino</b> bulbospinal reflex arc, this pattern of activity is also elicited through the conscious desire to urinate.|$|E
