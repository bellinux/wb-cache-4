2500|$|The Rally GT and the Rally SST did not {{disappear}} completely this year; {{this can be}} described that they were downgraded from being trim levels to optional packages that were offered by several VAM dealerships. A Rally SST equivalent was created including most of the still available optional items including automatic transmission, air conditioning, rear wiper and washer, reading dome light, intermittent wipers, lighted vanity mirror on passenger's side <b>sunvisor,</b> and built-in side armrest safety reflectors. The only option that were virtually separate at all times were the new tape player, electric antenna and mirror controls. This set of components was called [...] "paquete de lujo" [...] by VAM's dealerships and the units carrying it had no particular name or designation. On {{the other side of}} the coin, there was a second optional package for Rally AMXs with manual transmission that included all mechanical components of the Rally GT 4.6 / X engine (302 degree camshaft, headers, Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetor, counterweight-modified high-acceleration Prestolite electronic distributor and 3.31:1 rear gears) except for the ported head. Unlike the luxury package, units equipped with the performance one did get a special name that was either Rally ZX or Rally TX, depending on the dealership that sold the unit.|$|E

50|$|The 1967 Dart, {{along with}} all other 1967 Chrysler products, got a new dual-circuit brake {{hydraulic}} system to ensure loss of pressure in the front brakes would not prevent the rear brakes from working, and vice versa. The system also incorporated a brake system fault telltale on the dashboard. Other changes to comply with new federal safety laws included collapsible steering columns, additional padding on the dashboard and <b>sunvisors.</b> Shoulder belt anchors were also provided for front outboard occupants.|$|R
25|$|The 1976 {{models were}} {{almost the same}} as their {{immediate}} predecessors; their differences were limited to a compression ratio increase for the 258 six from 7.6:1 to 8.0:1. New gauges appeared {{in the form of a}} 160km/h speedometer and revised warning lights, <b>sunvisors</b> were redesigned to larger more rectangular units with side bending portions, a new more-ornate dome light lens, new seat and side panel designs, while a rear defroster was added to the options. The separate seatbelts warning buzzer between the wipers and lights knobs was discontinued. New full-rubber bumper guards became available alongside the already existing metal ones with rubber strips.|$|R
50|$|The Allstate was {{essentially}} a Henry J, but {{with a number of}} differences that included Allstate badges on the hood and rear deck, a more upscale interior of Saran plaid or occasionally leather or smooth vinyl, special hubcaps/wheel covers, horn buttons and instrument bezels, a locking glove box and trunk lid, special engine color (blue), custom armrests and <b>sunvisors,</b> revised door locks and keys, and special parking and taillamp assemblies. Most notably, the Allstate featured a unique two-bar grille and jet-plane hood ornament designed by Alex Tremulis, who had come to Kaiser-Frazer from the Tucker Corporation.|$|R

50|$|The Ghia was {{the luxury}} model. It had black 14-inch steel wheels with {{full-size}} plastic wheel covers, power steering, body-coloured rear-view mirrors and bumpers, velour interior trim, tachometer, centre console with Ghia emblem, lockable glovebox, driver's seat with lumbar support and height adjust, storage drawer underneath {{the front passenger}} seat, full-size interior door trims, vanity mirror in passenger <b>sunvisor,</b> ticket holder in driver's <b>sunvisor,</b> felt interior headlining and sunvisors, rear headrests, additional warning lights in the instrument cluster, central locking with illuminated driver's door lock barrel, remote exterior mirrors, front door map pockets, front seatback pockets, additional reading lamps, chrome insert strips in the body side mouldings and bumpers, red tailgate garnish and orange beaver panel garnish. Air conditioning and power windows were optional. The stereo was a digitally tuned AM/FM unit, which featured a cassette player with Dolby enhanced sound. The 1.6-litre engine was fitted as standard, with EFI optional (standard on wagon), with either 5-speed manual or 3-speed automatic transmission (EFI automatic was 4-speed).|$|E
50|$|The {{first use}} of the Kingsway name was in Canada for the 1940 model year (model D15), {{basically}} Dodge's rebadged version of the Plymouth. The base model came with one taillamp, one <b>sunvisor</b> and one windshield wiper - all on the driver's side. The body was Plymouth with Dodge nameplates, hood ornament and a grille that fit the Plymouth front end. Body styles were business coupe, 2-door and 4-door sedans.|$|E
50|$|The Holden HR {{range was}} {{released}} in April 1966, replacing the Holden HD series which had been in production since 1965. In addition to a revised grille, the HR featured a reworked roofline and larger rear window (on the sedans), revised rear lights (on sedans and wagons) and changes to almost all exterior body panels.Other changes included revised ball joint front suspension, widened track, improved interior trim and woodgrain interior finish for the Premier models. Six months after {{the launch of the}} HR, all models were given a safety upgrade with the addition of front safety belts, windscreen washers, reversing lights, <b>sunvisors</b> and a shatterproof interior rearview mirror.|$|R

50|$|The {{first two}} {{locomotives}}, DeKi 501 and 502, {{were built in}} 1973, based on the earlier Class DeKi 300 design. These locomotives were finished in then-standard blue Chichibu Railway livery from new, {{as opposed to the}} brown livery initially carried by earlier classes. Locomotives DeKi 503 and 504 were delivered in March 1979 ahead of the opening of the Mikajiru Freight Line in October of the same year. These locomotives had larger cab end windows and <b>sunvisors</b> above the cab windows. The last three locomotives of the class, DeKi 505 to 507 were delivered in 1980. DeKi 507 is unique among the class in being privately owned by Taiheiyo Cement, and its introduction in 1980 allowed the similarly privately owned DeKi 101 to be transferred to Chichibu Railway ownership.|$|R
50|$|The {{changes to}} the cab {{included}} a new day cab, which is 150 mm longer with redesigned air intake and flat floor. New rear view mirrors were introduced to reduce blind spots and improve air flow, new headlights and front side marker lights, new split <b>sunvisor</b> and new wider front steps complemented the external modifications. The interior was redesigned with more rounded edges around the dashboard and new seats with integrated seatbelts. Integrated telephone speaker and microphone with steering wheel controls for radio and inbuilt GSM phone were an option.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the more}} famous no-frills cars was the Studebaker Scotsman, which was on sale from 1957 to 1958. These cars came with a low-grade cloth-trimmed front seat and {{contained}} only a driver's side <b>sunvisor,</b> no door armrests and painted trim (in lieu of chrome trim); even routine convenience items, such as a cigarette lighter and dome light were deleted. Buyers were allowed to buy only a low-cost heater {{and a few other}} trim and convenience items from a short options list; a radio was not offered as an option on this model (unlike Studebaker's more expensive models).|$|E
50|$|Convenience {{standard}} accessories included power steering, tinted windshield, intermittent wipers, woodgrain panels applied on dashboard, luxury steering wheel, heater with front defroster, Quartz clock, 180 km/h-110 mph speedometer, {{water temperature}} and gasoline level gauges, warning lights with international symbols, inside hood release, rear defroster, lighted vanity mirror on passenger's side <b>sunvisor,</b> AM FM stereo radio with four speakers, cigarette lighter, front ashtray, locking glove box, parcel shelf, complete light group (hood, trunk, front ashtray, glovebox, courtesy, reading dome light), dual remote-controlled remote mirrors (non-electric), three-point retractable front seatbelts, side armrest safety reflectors on front doors, dual rear ashtrays, spare tire cover and locking gas cap. Optional equipment included air conditioning system, power door locks, power windows, power trunk release, electric antenna, power seats, tilt steering column, headers.|$|E
2500|$|Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser (1964–1977) - a {{stretched}} wheelbase Cutlass station wagon, {{which was}} stretched to 120" [...] from 115" [...] in the 1964-67 models and to 121" [...] from 116" [...] in the 1968-72 models, the stretched area {{being in the}} second-row seating area. This car featured an elevated roof over the rear seat and cargo area and glass skylights over the rear seating area, which consisted of a transverse skylight over the second seat (two-piece from 1964 to 1967, one-piece from 1968 to 1972) and small longitudinal skylights directly over the rear cargo-area windows, and also featured standard second-row <b>sunvisors.</b> The three-seat models featured forward-facing seating, {{at a time when}} most three-seat station wagons had the third row of seats facing the rear. From 1965 to 1970, it would be Oldsmobile's flagship station wagon, as no full-sized wagons were produced. The third-generation 1973-77 models no longer had skylights other than an optional front-row pop-up sunroof. This car was merely an up-line trim package on the Cutlass Supreme wagon and carried the Vista Cruiser nameplate rather than the Cutlass nameplate. The optional third seat was rear-facing in the third-generation Vista Cruiser.|$|R

Only 6 months later Volvo once again claimed a first with the FH16 and [...] on tap introducing one of the world's most powerful production series truck. Continuing on its Euro V theme upgrades to 13 Litre engines and introduction of the new 11 Litre engine followed a few months later.|$|E
50|$|From 1971, Australian {{assembled}} Matadors were {{equipped with}} standard column shift automatic transmissions, power steering, power windows, air conditioning, and an AM radio. The engine {{in the later}} years was AMC's 360 CID L V8. Options included exterior <b>sunvisor,</b> vinyl roof cover, tow hitch, and mud flaps. Registrations for AMC vehicles dropped after 1974. A total of 118 Hornets and 145 Matadors (118 sedans, 27 wagons) were sold during 1974. Registrations for 1975 were 136 Hornets and 118 Matadors (85 sedans 33 wagons). In 1976 there were 88 Matadors (78 sedans, 10 wagons), while 1977 saw just 24 Matador sedans and 3 wagons. Additionally, Matador coupe CKD kits arrived in late-1974, and the assembly of 80 cars began in 1976. One fully assembled AMC Pacer was imported for evaluation purposes.|$|E
5000|$|Charged with wilful murder, {{for which}} {{he could have been}} executed, the jury's lesser {{conviction}} of manslaughter brought him a sentence of 10 years imprisonment, of which he served 5 years in Fremantle Prison and Karnet Prison Farm, before being paroled. The serial killer, Eric Edgar Cooke, confessed to the murder of Anderson when arrested in 1963, giving details withheld by police that only the killer would have known, and again when on death row, including immediately before his execution, at which point he swore on a Bible that he was the offender. At Button's subsequent appeal, little credence was given to Cooke's testimony as the vehicle Cooke claimed he had used had an external steel <b>sunvisor.</b> The appeal judges did not believe a body could be thrown [...] "over the roof" [...] as Cooke claimed without ripping the visor off and dismissed the appeal.|$|E
5000|$|The 1963 Rambler Classics were {{available}} only in two- and four-door sedan body designs, both called Rambler Classic 660. No other trim levels or versions {{were available}}. The standard engine and transmission combination was the OHV 195.6 CID L I6 engine with a single barrel carburetor producing [...] at 4200 rpm with a 8.7:1 compression ratio and coupled to a three-speed manual transmission with column-mounted shifter. The [...] two-barrel version of the 195.6 six was also available at extra cost. Standard equipment for all included built-in flow-through ventilation, four wheel drum brakes with twin-circuits and a double master cylinder, manual steering, electric wipers and washers, coil-spring-based suspension, carpeting, front and rear bench seats consisting of foam rubber and coil springs, side marker lights, hazard lights, backup lights, luxury steering wheel with horn ring and [...] "R" [...] emblem, 200 km/h speedometer, fuel and water temperature gauges, dual front ashtrays, cigarette lighter, electric clock, AM radio, rearview mirror, front and rear side armrests, dual rear ashtrays, dual coat hooks, round dome light, padded <b>sunvisors,</b> driver's side remote mirror, {{as well as a}} bright molding package.

5000|$|Racing {{equipment}} includes tubular exhaust headers, {{an electric}} fuel pump, altered rear suspension with heavy-duty traction control bars and asymmetrical leaf springs, heavy-duty trunk-mounted battery, locking differential, auxiliary gauges, special drag race wheels and tires supplied both by Goodyear and Mickey Thompson (himself {{a recipient of}} one of the first ten cars) and an aluminum scatter shield designed to contain the clutch in case of disintegration under load. The claimed compression ratio was 13.5:1. Other weight-saving measures include the elimination of such street items as the <b>sunvisors,</b> radio, heater, wheel covers, passenger side windshield wiper, arm rests, rear window cranks, mirrors, sound deadening material, carpeting, trunk mat, lug wrench, jack and spare tire. Front seats were either lightweight units from Ford's police package vehicles or rudimentary bucket seats from the Econoline van; the carpeting was replaced with a black rubber mat. The rear seat was a standard Fairlane unit. The high-beam headlights were eliminated as well and in their place were mesh-covered air intakes which ran directly to a special air cleaner atop the 427. Like the street version, the Thunderbolt's outer high-low 5.75 inch (146 mm) headlights of the type normally used with a four-lamp system were selectable with a standard foot-operated switch. Though it was technically a street legal automobile, these modifications and deletions along with a final drive ratio of 4:57.1 for the four-speed cars and 4:44.1 for the automatics make the Thunderbolt impractical for street use.|$|R
5000|$|The Rally GT and the Rally SST did not {{disappear}} completely this year; {{this can be}} described that they were downgraded from being trim levels to optional packages that were offered by several VAM dealerships. A Rally SST equivalent was created including most of the still available optional items including automatic transmission, air conditioning, rear wiper and washer, reading dome light, intermittent wipers, lighted vanity mirror on passenger's side <b>sunvisor,</b> and built-in side armrest safety reflectors. The only option that were virtually separate at all times were the new tape player, electric antenna and mirror controls. This set of components was called [...] "paquete de lujo" [...] by VAM's dealerships and the units carrying it had no particular name or designation. On {{the other side of}} the coin, there was a second optional package for Rally AMXs with manual transmission that included all mechanical components of the Rally GT 4.6 / X engine (302 degree camshaft, headers, Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetor, counterweight-modified high-acceleration Prestolite electronic distributor and 3.31:1 rear gears) except for the ported head. Unlike the luxury package, units equipped with the performance one did get a special name that was either Rally ZX or Rally TX, depending on the dealership that sold the unit.|$|E
5000|$|The {{greatest}} novelty for 1981 was {{the introduction}} of a third trim level within the VAM's Rally line, the company's first high-end luxury sporty model called Rally SST. This version carried the same mechanicals as the Rally AMX except that it came equipped from the factory with the three-speed automatic transmission. Appearance wise, the car carried bright trim on the wheel lips, drip rails, B-pillar molding plus door and side glass bases. The moldings for the windshield and rear glass were also bright instead of blacked out while both bumpers were chromed. The lower portions of the sides, doors and front fenders carried wide moldings with a horizontal six-stripe pattern. The in-house five-spoke wheels held AMC's [...] "Noryl" [...] wheel cover design. Finally, chromed squared mirrors with inside controls were fitted to the doors. The Rally SST is the closest VAM counterpart to the AMC Spirits in terms of appearance and the Mexican equivalent of the US AMC Spirit Limited model. To reduce the sportiness and enforce the luxury appointments of the line, a fender-mounted electric antenna was made standard equipment so the AMX's sporty roof-mounted diagonal design would not be present. For this same reason, the rear spoiler was not available. Among its unique characteristics, the Rally SST included side armrest safety reflectors and <b>sunvisor</b> lighted vanity mirror from the factory, which were unavailable in the AMXs and GTs. The interior of the Rally SST was the same as the one of the GTs and AMXs with the only exceptions of the center console having an open compartment in place of the auxiliary gauges and the Quartz electric digital clock instead of both tachometer types. Despite the luxury focus, the sporty aspects were retained {{in the form of the}} individual reclining Recaro-type bucket seats, center console with armrest and rear ashtray, floor-mounted transmission, leather-wrapped sports steering wheel and the full suspension package with rear sway bar.|$|E
40|$|Scania {{is facing}} big {{challenges}} in the future. The constantly increasing competition requires Scania to constantly improve its production system. At the Chassis assembly in Södertälje, final assembly of trucks is performed. This master’s thesis {{has been carried out}} at one section of the Chassis assembly where cabs are being prepared for mounting on the truck chassis. In this section, the Cab pre-assembly, there are many opportunities for improvement. The function of the Cab pre-assembly is to mount air deflectors, front hatch and <b>sunvisor</b> on the cab. The Cab pre-assembly is divided into a number of workstations where different tasks are performed. At the air deflector station the air deflectors are mounted on the cab. At station 1 front hatches are preassembled, and subsequently mounted on the cab at the front hatch station. At the <b>sunvisor</b> station sunvisors are preassembled and then mounted on the cab. There are a variety of cab types, air deflector types, front hatch types and <b>sunvisor</b> types. This makes it difficult to level out, or balance, the workload on the different stations. The master’s thesis was initiated with a comprehensive data-gathering phase. Observation, interviews and time studies were performed to create insight in the situation on the Cab pre-assembly. The result of the time study was an extensive amount of data, which includes operation times for all tasks, for different types of cabs. The time studies showed that many of the cab types on the air deflector and front hatch stations takes more time than the takt time. This forces the assemblers to work really hard, but still they cannot always keep up. On other cab types the assembler at the air deflector station has no work at all. At station 1, on the other hand, all types of front hatches take shorter time than the takt time. For the assembler at the <b>sunvisor</b> station, all different types of sunvisors take different amount of time to assemble and mount, but the work can always be done within takt time. At the Cab pre-assembly there is also an assembler, known as a variant, who performs certain tasks at some types of cabs that takes more than the takt time to assemble. For example, this variant helps the assembler at the air deflector station with one type of cab that otherwise could not be assembled within takt time. The variant has many different tasks, and frequently a number of these tasks should be performed at the same time. Because of this the variant cannot carry out all tasks, and the assemblers who should have gotten help cannot perform their tasks in time. To even out the workload in the Cab pre-assembly and to unburden the variant, a concept for balancing of the Cab pre-assembly was developed. This concept includes- merging the front hatch station with the <b>sunvisor</b> station and letting a single assembler handle the workload at this new station- letting a variant preassemble the sunvisors that take long time to assemble and mount, to enable the above- moving some of the work, previously performed at the front hatch station, to station 1 and some of it to the air deflector station- moving the assembler from the front hatch station to the air deflector station and dividing the work at this station between the assembler at the air deflector station and this new assembler- unburden the variant of many tasks that the assemblers at the air deflector station can perform when they have no other work to do. Moving work from the front hatch station to the air deflector station was a prerequisite for implementing this solution. Therefore this concept was tried out in real production. This trial showed that it was possible for the assemblers to do their work within the takt time, but that it resulted in some ergonomic problems. By changing the sequence the work tasks were performed in, these problems could be solved. Evaluation indicates that the concept for balancing the Cab pre-assembly is feasible and that the concept would considerably improve the situation at the Cab pre-assembly. Scania is recommended to implement this concept at the Cab pre-assembly, to be able to solve many of the problems that exist in this section of the Chassis assembly.

2500|$|The {{introductory}} 1974 Gremlins became unique {{by incorporating}} the front clip of the 1974 U.S. AMC Hornet models. VAM never attempted {{to hide the}} relation between the two models, which never harmed the sales or image of either model and was favored by the public. The launch of the Gremlin in Mexico also meant the resurrection of the [...] I6 engine that was discontinued in 1972. The engine was practically the same as in its final year except for a slightly lower compression ratio (8.3:1 instead of 8.5:1). The advertised output was still the same at 145 gross horsepower at 4,400 revolutions per minute and was restricted to one-barrel carburetors. In contrast, since 1973 all VAM-based Hornets had the [...] six as the standard and only engine. VAM Gremlins were basic economy cars with manual 3-speed transmission, four-wheel drum brakes, manual steering, front sway bar, column-mounted shifters only, rigid four-bladed cooling fan, folding bench seats, two-point front seatbelts, electric wipers and washers, monaural AM radio, cigarette lighter, front and rear ashtrays, locking glovebox, flip-open rear side vents, roof rack, full carpeting with driver's side rubber mat, padded <b>sunvisors,</b> sound-insulating cardboard-type headliner, dual coat hooks and round dome light. Options for 1974 included a column-mounted automatic transmission, power steering, power drum brakes, heater, parcel shelf, light group, remote-controlled driver and passenger side outside mirrors, sports steering wheel, bright molding package, and wheel trim rings. All VAM Gremlins used the AMC's three-pod instrument cluster from the domestic-built Hornet with a blank in the third gauge position from the factory. The introductory year production was 2,137.|$|R
2500|$|For 1976, VAM {{introduced}} the Gremlin X {{for the first}} time in Mexico, retaking the economical sporty concept originally held by the Rally model. The company's engineers started to find solutions to the problem of lack of power without rising gas emission, and the 258 six obtained a higher 8.0:1 compression ratio this year. Due to this improvement along with the subcompact's lighter body and shorter exhaust, the 1976 Gremlin X outperformed the low-compression 1975 American Rally, despite that it wasn't offered with the new four-speed transmission. To avoid internal competition once again in both performance models as well as further pushing of the line's concept change, VAM proceeded to upgrade the American Rally to distance it from the new subcompact version. The 1976 models switched to the [...] 7.7:1 compression ratio VAM 282 cu in six cylinder with Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetor and 266 degree camshaft, shared with the VAM Pacer and all Classic models. This marked {{for the first time}} the presence of VAM's largest engine in the Hornet-based compact line. The works on solving the shortage of power on the 258 six were still in process in the 282, thus the existing version was installed under the hood. The 1976 American Rally in the performance department fared much better with its higher displacement, large-diameter valves, larger intake manifold and larger carburetor but was still falling short on compression ratio. The model outperformed all of its predecessors. However, there was an exception in the form of the 1972 Rambler American Rally with its 9.5:1 compression ratio 252 cu in six, which was still half a second faster despite its high-flow one-barrel carburetor, small intake manifold, three-speed transmission, higher rear gear ratio and lower displacement. Aside from the engine, the 1976 American Rally was accompanied by noticeable improvements consisting of power front disk brakes, power steering and tinted windshield, all as standard equipment. The four-speed transmission and heater were fully standardized this year. New seat patterns and side panel designs (without the etched Rally emblem) were used, while gauges were changed to a 160km/h speedometer and 6,000 RPM tachometer. New dome light lens design and longer <b>sunvisors</b> were shared with the American and Gremlin. The new engine and standard equipment coupled with the mid-year discontinuation of the 1976 Classic AMX (Matador X) ascended the American Rally into the top of the line performance model of the company. The sportiness and concept was fairly close to that of the 1972-1976 VAM Javelins and aforementioned Classic AMXs. With the engine change, the rear quarter panel emblems morphed into [...] "4.6" [...] units. After only one year, the model name [...] "Rally" [...] emblem on the rear panel was once again redesigned.|$|R
