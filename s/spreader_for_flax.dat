40|$|Flax is an {{important}} crop for oil and fiber, however, no high-density genetic maps have been reported for this species. Specific length amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) is a high-resolution strategy for large scale de novo discovery and genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms. In this study, SLAF-seq was employed to develop SNP markers in an F 2 population to construct a high-density genetic map <b>for</b> <b>flax.</b> In total, 196. 29 million paired-end reads were obtained. The average sequencing depth was 25. 08 in male parent, 32. 17 in the female parent, and 9. 64 in each F 2 progeny. In total, 389, 288 polymorphic SLAFs were detected, from which 260, 380 polymorphic SNPs were developed. After filtering, 4, 638 SNPs were found suitable for genetic map construction. The final genetic map included 4, 145 SNP markers on 15 linkage groups and was 2, 632. 94 cM in length, with an average distance of 0. 64 cM between adjacent markers.

40|$|The {{very high}} thermal {{conductivity}} of diamond was first noted in measurements performed by Eucken on natural crystals in 1911. In {{the sixties and}} seventies the use of diamond as a heat <b>spreader</b> <b>for</b> the removal of thermal energy produced by semiconductor microwave devices stimulated experimental and theoretical investigations of the thermal conductivity of natural or synthetic diamond single crystals. Roughly one decade after the first measurements of thermal conductivity performed on diamond films synthesized by microwave plasma CVD the thermal conductivity of high-quality diamond films has approached that of single crystals, and the use of CVD diamond as a heat <b>spreader</b> <b>for</b> electronic and opto-electronic devices is becoming - besides tool coatings - the most important application of this material. The intent of the present article is not to give {{a review of the literature}} on the thermal conductivity of diamond single crystals and thin films. Instead it attempts to give (in chapter 2) an introduction into important models presently used to discuss the influences of various factors on the thermal conductivity of dielectric solids.
