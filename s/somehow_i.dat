5|$|I {{wanted to}} speak a little about people who {{impressed}} the most, and <b>somehow</b> <b>I</b> kept on ignoring his performances in my previous two banters during this Olympiad, which is ridiculous, but I think pride of place goes to Eugenio Torre. You probably know who he is, and you probably have read about his results by now, but what he achieved during this Olympiad is absolutely tremendous. He {{is by no means}} a young man by now and he... played a tremendous level of opposition. The Philippines are a decently strong team and they played very, very decent opposition almost throughout the tournament. The result Eugenio showed in this event is absolutely fantastic.|$|E
25|$|To make it, I prayed by the hour. It was automatic, almost subconscious. I {{did not ask}} God to take me out of it. I prayed {{he would}} give me {{strength}} to endure it. When it would get so bad that I did not think I could stand it, I would ask God to ease it and <b>somehow</b> <b>I</b> would make it. He kept me.|$|E
25|$|I had to gain {{them some}} time, and I {{could think of}} nothing other than to attack. I had to stop them <b>somehow.</b> <b>I</b> distracted them, and I even managed to shoot one down, but then I myself was hit. My plane took 15 cannon hits, 80 by machine gun. My leg and my arm were injured, {{although}} I didn't feel a thing. I knew I probably wasn't going to make it back.|$|E

500|$|The film {{features}} a prevalent Moroccan chant {{of the phrase}} deshi basara (proper transliteration: Tījī basara’ah) (Arabic: تيجي بسرعة), which translates to [...] "rise up" [...] (literally: [...] "come quickly"). In November 2011, Zimmer crowdsourced online audio recordings of the chant {{to be used in}} the film's score. When asked about the chant for clarification, Zimmer said, [...] "The chant became a very complicated thing because I wanted hundreds of thousands of voices, and it's not so easy to get hundreds of thousands of voices. So, we tweeted and we posted on the internet, for people who wanted to be part of it. It seemed like an interesting thing. We've created this world, over these last two movies, and <b>somehow</b> <b>I</b> think the audience and the fans have been part of this world. We do keep them in mind." ...|$|E
500|$|The British POWs {{provided}} the Americans with necessary advice regarding the camp life and shared rations and clothing {{sent by the}} British Red Cross. The British, {{who were in the}} process of digging an escape tunnel, requested help from the Americans. Juskalian would later describe the operation: [...] "I volunteered, although I have had claustrophobia ever since a boyhood friend shut me up in a wood bin for a prank. When I look back at it, I wonder how I did it. Some nights when I think about it, I break out in a cold sweat. <b>Somehow,</b> <b>I</b> was able to summon up the will to do it. The tunnel was already some 80 to 100feet long. It extended underground beyond the barbed wire fence, but those in charge wanted to lengthen it so that the opening would come out below ground level on the steep side near the bank of the Fulda River. In that way when the tunnel was broken open, the escapees could not be seen by the guards in the towers." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{his early}} {{schooling}} life, {{he was interested}} in art, and has detailed that he would draw popular video game characters such as Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog. During high school, he would skip classes to play video games at an Internet cafe with friends; on this topic, PewDiePie has commented, [...] "Sweden has a great culture around gaming." [...] In 2008, he graduated from Göteborgs Högre Samskola. He then went on to pursue a degree in industrial economics and technology management at Chalmers University of Technology, but left the university in 2011. On his decision, PewDiePie has stated, [...] "Thinking about it now, it was utterly absurd. To get into Chalmers for industrial economics you need straight A's, but <b>somehow</b> <b>I</b> was happier selling hot dogs and making my own gaming-videos." [...] While his reason for leaving Chalmers has often been reported as a want to focus on his YouTube career, in 2017, PewDiePie clarified, [...] "Why does everyone get this story wrong? [...] I dropped out of university because I didn't like it. To drop out of university to pursue YouTube, that'd just be fucking stupid." [...] He added that [...] "industrial management and economics [...] boring as hell [...] I couldn't relate to fucking anyone." ...|$|E

500|$|The writer Michael Steinberg {{described}} the symphony's success as essentially {{a phenomenon of}} the compact disc, and while live performances are still given, they do not always sell out. Some critics, wondering at the sudden success of the piece nearly two decades after its composition, suggest that it resonated with a particular mood in the popular culture at the time. Stephen Johnson, writing in A guide to the symphony, wondered whether the commercial success of the work was [...] "a flash in the pan" [...] or {{would turn out to}} have lasting significance. In 1998, the critic Michael Steinberg asked, [...] " [...] really listening to this symphony? How many CD buyers discover that fifty-four minutes of very slow music with a little singing in a language they don't understand is more than they want? Is it being played as background music to Chardonnay and brie?" [...] Steinberg compared the success of Górecki's symphony to the Doctor Zhivago phenomenon of 1958: [...] "Everybody rushed to buy the book; few managed actually to read it. The appearance of the movie in 1965 rescued us all from the necessity." [...] Górecki was as surprised as anyone else at the recording's success, and later speculated that [...] "perhaps people find something they need in this piece of music…. <b>Somehow</b> <b>I</b> hit the right note, something they were missing. Something, somewhere had been lost to them. I feel that I instinctively knew what they needed." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the heart}} of this scene is Cable's song [...] "You've Got to Be Carefully Taught", in which Cable realizes the sources of his own racism. [...] Its frank lyrics made it perhaps the most {{controversial}} element of the show. Michener recalled in his memoirs that a delegation of New Englanders had approached him after a New Haven tryout and urged him to recommend the song's removal to Rodgers and Hammerstein. [...] When Michener told Hammerstein, he laughed and replied, [...] "That's what the show is about!" [...] Boston drama critic Elliot Norton, after seeing the show in tryouts, strongly recommended its removal, or at least that Cable sing it less [...] "briskly", as there was much bigotry in Boston; Logan replied that that was all the more reason for leaving it unaltered. Several New York reviewers expressed discomfort with the song; Wolcott Gibbs wrote of [...] "something called 'You've Got to Be Taught', a poem in praise of tolerance that <b>somehow</b> <b>I</b> found a little embarrassing" [...] while John Mason Brown opined that he was [...] "somewhat distressed by the dragged-in didacticism of such a plea for tolerance as 'You've Got to Be Taught'". After the Broadway opening, Hammerstein received a large number of letters concerning [...] "You've Got to Be Carefully Taught". [...] Judging by the letters that remain among his papers in the Library of Congress, the reaction was mixed. One correspondent wrote [...] "What can I say to a man who writes, 'You've got to be taught to hate and fear?'... Now that I know you, I feel that my informants didn't praise you enough." [...] Nevertheless, another wrote, [...] "I feel the inclusion of the song particularly in the album and to some extent in the show itself is not helpful to the cause of brotherhood, your intent to the contrary notwithstanding".|$|E
500|$|Poptimal Tanya Lane wrote, [...] "Wow…just wow. Grey's Anatomy {{has once}} again managed to shock with its season finale." [...] While she {{appreciated}} the [...] "realism and authenticity that Grey's is known for", she found the episode was [...] "almost too much" [...] as it was [...] "extremely gory and difficult to watch, initially because of the grisly wounds" [...] but later because of the [...] "heavy and emotional things that transpired". She thought Pompeo gave one of her best performances when her character learned that her sister was dead. Digital Spy Ben Lee found Leigh's and Dane's performances [...] "phenomenal" [...] and added that he had probably never seen a better performance from Dane. He described the moment the two actors shared as [...] "truly poignant". To him, Lexie's death felt like a finale, which was thus too early. As for {{what was happening in}} Seattle Grace, he thought it was [...] "a bit pointless" [...] and [...] "uninteresting" [...] except Altman's departure, which he deemed [...] "the most significant moment at the hospital". Entertainment Weekly Tanner Stransky commented of Lexie's death: [...] "It was an intense death. I mean, how awful was it to watch one of Grey’s longest-running characters pass away so quickly -- and rather unceremoniously? I get that Ms. Rhimes had to do what she had to do -- and every show needs to be shaken up once in a while -- but I don't love that Lexie was the one to die. Could it have been someone less important <b>somehow?</b> <b>I</b> guess it would have been too obvious to do Kepner. And you probably just don't kill off a hottie like Mark Sloan, right?" [...] Stransky also complained about Robbins' screams {{at the beginning of the}} episode, but enjoyed Bailey's story.|$|E

2500|$|Initially, Tom Cruise {{expressed}} interest in being involved as another actor to replace Ledger, but Gilliam turned him down because Cruise {{had never been a}} close friend of Ledger. Gilliam stated, [...] "I just wanted to keep this [...] family—it's as simple as that [...] There were people even offering to come and help, they didn't know Heath. It had to be in the family <b>somehow,</b> <b>I</b> don't know why; it was my attitude." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with series creator Reki Kawahara, the author noted that the female characters in Sword Art Online were not based on anyone he knew personally, with him stating [...] "I don't usually make a character, setting, or anything before I start writing. As I write the story, the girls become what they are now. So, <b>somehow,</b> <b>I</b> don't know exactly, but somehow, my subliminal idea or some hidden emotion creates the characters {{to be strong and}} capable." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dana, {{thinking}} about Kevin being {{stuck in the}} 1800s {{for an extended period}} of time: [...] "A place like this would endanger him in a way I didn’t want to talk to him about. If he was stranded here for years, some part of this place would rub off on him. No large part, I knew. [...] The place, the time would either kill him outright or mark him <b>somehow.</b> <b>I</b> didn’t like either possibility." [...] (Kindred, p.77) ...|$|E
2500|$|Evans left Davis' sextet in November 1958 {{and stayed}} {{with his parents}} in Florida and his brother in Louisiana. While he was burned out, {{one of the main}} reasons for leaving was his father's illness. During this sojourn, the always self-critical Evans {{suddenly}} felt his playing had improved. [...] "While I was staying with my brother in Baton Rouge, I remember finding that <b>somehow</b> <b>I</b> had reached a new level of expression in my playing. It had come almost automatically, and I was very anxious about it, afraid I might lose it." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the night}} of 14/15 April he was awakened by a steward. However, he was blocked from going to Titanics boat deck, from which {{lifeboats}} were already being launched, as a crewman assumed {{that he was a}} third class passenger. [...] He eventually made his way past the obstruction and {{made his way to the}} boat deck, where he saw with alarm that emergency flares were being fired: [...] "All the while flares signalling emergency were being shot into the air ceaselessly, and hideous blue flashes and noises were simply terrifying. <b>Somehow</b> <b>I</b> could in no way dispel the feeling of utter dread and desolation." ...|$|E

But that's not my way, and I reckon it's not yours. Very well. We have got to have a talk and put the thing over. To begin with, <b>I</b> <b>somehow</b> feel <b>I</b> can trust you, and needn't be disturbed." ...|$|R
2500|$|According to Gehry, [...] "I was a {{truck driver}} in L.A., going to City College, and I tried radio announcing, which I wasn't very good at. I tried {{chemical}} engineering, which I wasn't very good at and didn't like, and then I remembered. You know, <b>somehow</b> <b>I</b> just started wracking my brain about, 'What do I like?' Where was I? What made me excited? And I remembered art, that I loved going to museums and I loved looking at paintings, loved listening to music. Those things came from my mother, who took me to concerts and museums. I remembered Grandma and the blocks, and just on a hunch, I tried some architecture classes." [...] Gehry graduated with a Bachelor of Architecture degree from USC in 1954.|$|E
2500|$|Jordan kept a diary {{during his}} service in France. [...] On March 1, 1918, {{five days before}} he was killed, Jordan wrote in his diary: [...] "I do not {{want you to think}} for a moment that I am taking this thing entirely light-mindedly. [...] No, not at all, but my {{attitude}} is this: Do the best you can and know how and then keep on smiling." [...] On March 2, 1918, he made his last entry: [...] "This fighting [...] we are doing now is the real thing. [...] A man gets to be quite a fatalist in this game. [...] If somehow or other they get me -— all well and good. If not —- still better. But <b>somehow</b> <b>I</b> feel safe." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{never would}} have {{amounted}} to anything in the theatre if it hadn't been for Orson Welles," [...] Lee recalled. [...] "The way I looked at acting, it was interesting and it was certainly better than going hungry. But I didn't have a serious approach to it until … I bumped into Orson Welles. He was putting on a Federal Theatre production of Macbeth with Negro players and, <b>somehow,</b> <b>I</b> won the part of Banquo. He rehearsed us for six solid months, but when the play finally went on before an audience, it was right—and {{it was a wonderful}} sensation, knowing it was right. Suddenly, the theatre became important to me. I had a respect for it, for what it could say. I had the ambition—I caught it from Orson Welles—to work like mad and be a convincing actor." ...|$|E
