5|$|A man on an {{international}} flight injects himself with an insulin pen, which releases a biological agent that quickly kills everyone aboard by causing their flesh to crystallize. The airplane's autopilot system lands the plane at Boston's Logan Airport, where various federal agencies create {{a task force to}} investigate what occurred during the flight. F.B.I. Special Agent Olivia Dunham (Torv) and her partner, Agent Scott (Mark Valley), are together in bed at a motel, where <b>Scott</b> <b>says</b> that he loves her. Dunham receives a call from her boss Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo), who tells her to head to the airport. Dunham is added to the interagency task force headed by Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick).|$|E
500|$|According to Scott, {{the basic}} track took [...] "a couple of hours" [...] {{before they had}} a {{satisfactory}} take. The musicians then recorded a second song, [...] "Simply Shady", which, like [...] "Hari's on Tour", would be included on Harrison's forthcoming album, Dark Horse. The five band members stayed over at Friar Park before Ford, Bennett, Kellaway and Guerin left for Denver the following day. <b>Scott</b> <b>says</b> he stayed on and worked further with Harrison at FPSHOT; {{in addition to the}} various horn parts, he played organ on [...] "Hari's on Tour".|$|E
500|$|After Leslie {{notices the}} name [...] "Liz Waverly" [...] {{in one of}} Kelly's Twilight books, Kelly admits she is his 12-year-old daughter. He is {{divorced}} from her mother, and wants to put Twilight into the time capsule to impress her. Leslie now wants to include it, but Ben (Adam <b>Scott)</b> <b>says</b> if she makes one exception, everyone will want their own item in the capsule. Leslie decides to hold a public meeting so all citizens can make suggestions for capsule items. The meeting descends into chaos when the participants argue over what to include and make absurd suggestions, like human ashes and dead cats. Conservative activist Marcia Langman (Darlene Hunt) argues Twilight should not be included because it is too anti-Christian, while a civil liberties organization member says that the book isn't suitable because it is pro-Christian. Leslie tries to compromise by making multiple time capsules, but she ultimately decides to stick to one capsule and include nothing except a video recording of the meeting, which she said represents Pawnee because it shows [...] "a {{lot of people with}} a lot of opinions arguing passionately for what they believed in". Ben, a visiting state auditor, says he thinks the residents of Pawnee are strange, but he is impressed by their passion.|$|E

2500|$|Eugenie Scott of the National Center for Science Education, {{a nonprofit}} {{organization}} dedicated to defending {{the teaching of evolution}} in the public schools, claimed debates are not the sort of arena to promote science to creationists. <b>Scott</b> <b>says</b> that [...] "Evolution is not on trial in the world of science," [...] and [...] "the topic of the discussion should not be the scientific legitimacy of evolution" [...] but rather should be on the lack of evidence in creationism. Stephen Jay Gould adopted a similar position, explaining: ...|$|E
2500|$|Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune {{said the}} film [...] "pushes its R rating pretty hard, though {{as with most}} Smith {{characters}} this side of Silent Bob, there's a lot more raunch in the talk — the sheer, voluminous, often hilarious verbosity — than in the action." [...] A. O. <b>Scott</b> <b>says</b> Smith [...] "has been tinkering with the dirty-mind/soft-heart combination for quite some time, forming a link of sorts between the humanist sexual anarchy of John Waters and the smutty Victorianism of Judd Apatow'; according to Scott: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1870, {{he began}} {{proceedings}} for bankruptcy, which were still not concluded by his death. <b>Scott</b> <b>says</b> he [...] "took to {{a sort of}} farming at considerable expense ... He began to get into deep water, and into the hands of 20 per cent money-lenders. Still he fought bravely with his difficulties, and even when his large salary was placed under trustees, he went on with his historic subjects". [...] His venture was ill-timed, hitting a period of agricultural depression. [...] A series of twelve dividends to his creditors, between 1871 and September 1876, paid off at least 7s 7d in the pound - dividends number 1, 7 & 8 seem not to appear in the London Gazette search results.|$|E

The Human Rights Campaign's profile of Scott also contains this sentence as his statement under 'position on marriage equality'.|$|R
2500|$|The album's deluxe edition {{featured}} four bonus tracks. [...] "Pig" [...] leaked as a demo {{in early}} 2007, this song details {{the life of}} a pig including playing in the mud as a piglet, falling in love, getting married, raising children and eventually being slaughtered. The final version of the track appears on the deluxe edition of the Weezer album. [...] "King" [...] is the last song on the deluxe edition of the Weezer album and is sung by Scott Shriner. In the liner notes for the deluxe edition <b>Scott</b> <b>says</b> that the song was not being voted {{by the rest of the}} band but was one of his favorite tracks from the demos Rivers played for the band. One day Scott called up Rivers and demanded the band add the song on the album, Rivers responded by saying that if he [...] wanted the song so bad he should sing it, and so he did. The song apparently took the longest to record and perfect, taking three weeks.|$|E
2500|$|Despite its {{international}} success, Star Trek Beyond {{was met by}} critics who were less taken with the film. Kyle Smith of the New York Post gave the film 1½ stars out of 4 and he commented that the filmmakers [...] "should have called it Star Trek Into Drowsiness." [...] Smith later added, [...] "Beyond is tepid when it’s trying to be emotional, moronic when it’s trying to be thrilling and unfunny when it’s trying to be non-unfunny. It lacks a storytelling module: Things just click into place when needed, as when Kirk commands Scotty to rev up a busted old spaceship, <b>Scott</b> <b>says</b> it’s impossible, and 14 seconds later everything is ready to rip." [...] James Berardinelli of Reelviews gave 2½ stars out of 4, writing: [...] "Star Trek Beyond is a Star Trek movie, although not an especially good one; The action sequences are frenetic, kinetic, and at times incoherent. This isn’t unexpected; it’s Lin’s trademark. But the plot, credited to Simon Pegg & Doug Jung, is pure Trek. Unfortunately, it’s also instantly forgettable." [...] Dave Robinson of outlet Crash Landed writes that [...] "Star Trek Beyond fails to push beyond its own roots and becomes just another very safe sci-fi popcorn movie in an increasingly crowded market, that will likely have you leaving the theatre feeling exactly as you entered." [...] Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C+ and wrote, [...] "ith Beyond, it feels like just another summer tentpole with not enough going on underneath the tent." ...|$|E

50|$|Scott appealed, and on February 25, 1997, the Missouri Court of Appeals {{threw out}} the {{conviction}} due to prosecutorial misconduct. Prosecutors hadn't told the defense about two witnesses who reportedly heard <b>Scott</b> <b>say</b> he'd deliberately broken the levee. He was retried in 1998. This time, he was convicted after only three hours of deliberation on April 30. The original sentence was reinstated on July 6.|$|R

5000|$|In 1846 {{the slave}} Dred Scott sued for {{his and his}} wife's freedom {{as they had been}} held as slaves in free states. All of the trials, {{including}} a Missouri Supreme Court hearing, were held in the Old Courthouse. The case was ultimately decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1857 Dred Scott v. Sandford, which ruled against the <b>Scotts,</b> <b>saying</b> they did not have grounds as citizens to sue.|$|R

5000|$|His later {{works have}} often {{involved}} investigations into powerful organizations, {{such as the}} Catholic Church or the United States military. Critics have increasingly remarked {{on the impact of}} his films as investigative journalism, with The New York Times's A.

50|$|Sociologists Fulcher and <b>Scott</b> <b>say</b> {{that in a}} parentocracy, Resources + Preferences = Choice. As Ball, et al. says, not {{everyone}} has the same resources {{to make the same}} decisions. For example middle class parents are more likely to pay for tutoring for their child to pass exams, while working class may have the same intention but cannot. Ball also discusses how marketization only ‘appeared’ to create a parentocracy, by providing equal right to education and letting parents choose which they want their child to attend.|$|R
5000|$|Ramsey Isler of IGN rated [...] "Sabotage" [...] a [...] "Decent" [...] 7.2 out of 10. Isler was {{generally}} negative about the episode, citing {{some of the}} plot to be [...] "ridiculously convenient {{to the point of}} contrivance." [...] Among Isler's complaints was the sudden arrival of Eli, Chloe and <b>Scott,</b> <b>saying</b> that the [...] "drama set up in the previous episode is squandered". Also, the revelation that James had caused the FTL drive to explode, was [...] "kind of random." [...] Isler also did not like the plot device of the communication stones being used for intimacy. Meredith Woerner from Io9 was also very negative with the episode. Woerner's biggest complaint was with Eli, Chloe and <b>Scott,</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "was I alone in screaming [...] "No, no no no no no no" [...] at the TV when the gate linked up again?" [...] Among her other complaints was the lack of character development for Wray and the quick explanation of the device that was found in the episode [...] "Faith". Overall, Woerner said: [...] "I was hesitant to invest in another story line {{that may or may not}} be solved by a simple reset. I still have high hopes for the series&#x5b;,&#x5d; because the last few episodes have continually elevated the material and characters." ...|$|R
6000|$|We now {{understand}} Scott's methods as editor. They are not scientific; they are literary. We also acknowledge (on internal evidence) his interpolation {{of his own}} stanzas in Kinmont Willie and Jamie Telfer, where he exalts his chief and ancestor. We cannot do otherwise (as scholars) than regret and condemn Scott's interpolations, never confessed. As lovers of poetry we acknowledge that, without Scott's interpolation, we could have no more of Kinmont Willie than verses, [...] "much mangled by reciters," [...] as <b>Scott</b> <b>says,</b> of a ballad perhaps no more poetical than Jock o' the Side. <b>Scott</b> <b>says</b> that [...] "some conjectural emendations have been absolutely necessary to render it intelligible." [...] As it is now very intelligible, to say [...] "conjectural emendations" [...] {{is a way of}} saying [...] "interpolations." ...|$|E

5000|$|Working on the film, Brad Dourif recalls [...] "We {{all felt}} really bad about it. But Blatty {{tried to do}} his best under very {{difficult}} circumstances. And I remember George C. <b>Scott</b> <b>saying</b> that the folks would only be satisfied if Madonna came out and sang a song at the end!" [...] Dourif feels that [...] "The original version {{was a hell of}} a lot purer and I liked it much more. As it stands now, it's a mediocre film. There are parts that have no right to be there.|$|R

6000|$|Of [...] "Kidnapped," [...] Stevenson said (as Thackeray said of Henry Esmond and Lady Castlewood, as <b>Scott</b> <b>says</b> of Dugald Dalgetty) that, in {{this book}} alone of his, [...] "the {{characters}} took the bit in their teeth," [...] at a certain point. [...] "It was they who spoke, it was they who wrote {{the remainder of the}} story." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{a note in}} his biography, <b>Scott</b> <b>says</b> {{that his}} friend Dr. Tuke, of Dublin, has a lock of Stella’s hair, {{enclosed}} in a paper by Swift, on which are written in the Dean’s hand, the words: “Only a woman’s hair.” An instance, says Scott, of the Dean’s desire to veil his feelings under the mask of cynical indifference.|$|E
6000|$|Here, also, we were {{interested}} in a plain marble slab, which marks the last resting-place of Scott's faithful Tom Purdie, his zealous factotum.

25|$|In October 1998, the APEC {{controversy}} came to {{the fore}} again when the New Democrat M.P Dick Proctor claimed during a flight to have overheard the Solicitor General Andy Scott tell his travelling companion Fred Toole that the inquiry into the APEC protests {{was going to be a}} white-wash, and that it had already decided before the inquiry had even began that Chrétien was going to be cleared of wrongdoing. Chrétien denied Proctor's account of what he claimed to have heard <b>Scott</b> <b>say,</b> and initially Chrétien stated that Scott would stay on as Solicitor General. But as the controversy increased, Scott suddenly resigned, to be replaced with Lawrence MacAulay.|$|R
