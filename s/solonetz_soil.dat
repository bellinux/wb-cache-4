Vertisolic Solonetzic soils have features intergrading the Vertisolic order in addition to any of the above Solonetzic features. The developmental sequence of Solonetzic soils is commonly from saline parent material to Solonetz, Solodized Solonetz and Solod. As leaching progresses, the salts and sodium ions are translocated downward. If leaching progresses for long enough and salts are removed completely, the Solonetzic B may disintegrate completely. The soil would then be classified in another order. Resalinization may occur and reverse the process associated with leaching.|$|R
40|$|Solonetz {{is a type}} of {{alkaline}} soil which covers about 3. 75 % of the Province of Vojvodina, Serbia. In order to investigate the potential implementation of efficient agricultural production on this soil, we investigated the stability of structural aggregates and sealing risk (crusting hazard) in the surface layer (0 - 20 cm) of solonetz exposed to different land use. Four classes of stable aggregates (8000 - 2000, 2000 - 250, 250 - 53 and < 53 μm) were obtained and the risk of sealing was calculated.

Glasshouse and field studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of the depth and intensity of soil disturbance and soil moisture conditions at the time of disturbance on rhizoctonia root rot of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv.

40|$|An {{outstanding}} part of {{the animal}} products {{are based on the}} grasslands, {{due to the fact that}} the grassland ecosystems can be found all over the globe. In places where economical and successful crop production cannot be managed, the grassland based animal husbandry can be an efficient way of food production. In addition, these ecosystems have an important role in carbon sequestration, and with their rich flora – and fauna connected to it – in conservation of biodiversity. The protection of nature, and the sustainable agriculture is getting more and more attention in the European Union, but, looking at the consumers’ needs, the production of healthy food cannot be neglected either. Because of these facts, the effects of two specific composts - which are officially authorized in organic farming, in Agri-environment Schemes and Natura 2000 programs – on grass yields and sward compositions were investigated in a field trial. The investigation took place in Hungary, on a natural grassland based on <b>solonetz</b> <b>soil.</b> Three rates of compost (10 t/ha, 20 t/ha, 30 t/ha) were tested on 3 m X 10 m experimental plots.

Samples for laboratory analysis were also taken. Dry matter yield of pasture showed positive responses to the rates of composts. The increase in dry matter yield was partly due to some positive changes in sward composition.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is a better {{understanding}} of the distribution and formation of salt efflorescences by mineralogical examination. Dominant sodium sulphate and sodium chloride surface efflorescences were selected for investigation. 24 samples were collected between 1999 and 2005 from 16 sites. The soil types were solonchak and meadow <b>solonetz.</b> Basic <b>soil</b> and groundwater analyses were performed according to the standard methods. Minerals were determined by X-ray diffractometry and SEM combined with microanalysis. The evaporation experiments were carried out in a Sanyo Versatile 350 HT environmental test chamber. It was concluded that common sulphate salts form rare and unique mineral associations on salt affected soils in Hungary. Comparing the groundwater compositions and the mineral associations of surface efflorescences or that of precipitated evaporites of groundwaters, the conclusion can be drawn that groundwater composition is reflected much better by the mineral association of experimentally precipitated evaporates of the groundwater than by the mineral associations of surface efflorescences. These differences suggest that the soil matrix may have an effect on the crystallization of minerals (e. g. gypsum, thenardite) in the efflorescences. The differences also suggest that in the surface efflorescences the precipitation process does not come to the end in all cases (minerals with high solubility are missing). Concerning the data on groundwater level depths in case of different (sodium carbonate versus sodium sulphate and sodium chloride) efflorescences, there is a tendency of declining groundwater table in the sequence of these soils. This difference can be explained by the difference (increase) in the solubility of various salt minerals. It was recognized that the change in the major component of surface efflorescenes in time (i. e. the sodium carbonate and sodium carbonate chloride versus sodium sulphate efflorescences before and after 1998) can be explained by the decline of the groundwater level and by the decreasing hydromorphic influence in the lowland area during the 19 th and 20 th century. Finally it can be stated that the presented research — which mainly focused on mineralogical aspects — has contributed to the earlier knowledge on surface salt efflorescences, which was based only on their chemical composition...|$|R
40|$|Soils of the Argentine Pampas {{have been}} {{developed}} over same parent material (loess), but evolved under different topography and land use. This led to different soil structural behaviour. In the flooding Pampa of Argentina <b>soils</b> (<b>Solonetzes)</b> are flooded each winter-spring and dried each summer, and are grazed by livestock all year round. Little is known about cattle trampling effects under these environmental conditions. In the nearby rolling Pampa, there are silty loams affected by physical deterioration and water erosion losses after long term conventional tillage (CT). After continuous zero tillage (ZT) these soils often develop shallow compaction. Little is known about abiotic and biotic mechanisms of structural recovery. The general objective of this thesis was to analyze comparatively natural and made-man factors affecting soil structural behaviour in soils with similar parent material (loess) and vegetation (grassland), but later affected by different relief and soil use factors. In the flooding Pampa results showed the occurrence of significant soil volume changes by swelling and shrinking. Soils swell during flooding because of a process of air entrapment. Livestock trampling causes the mechanical destruction of surface macropores in summer when soil dries. The regeneration of damaged pores takes place during flooding, when soils swell at maximum. Droughts -and not floods- cause negative environmental effects in this area. In the rolling Pampa similar soil macropore volumes were determined in pasture, CT and ZT situations, showing none effect from soil management. Topsoil hardening was often found after short term ZT. Results from a greenhouse experiment showed that aggregate stabilization requires a previous fragmentation by short wetting-drying cycles. Clod shrinkage curves and soil cracking studies showed that silty loams {{do not have the}} expected poor response to W/D cycles. However, their air filled porosity increases little during drying. Results showed topsoil aggregation to be mainly abiotic in the flooding Pampa, and abiotic and biotic in the rolling Pampa, showing different structural behaviour in soils evolved from same parent material but different relief and land use...|$|R
40|$|Factors {{governing}} {{the evolution of}} solonetzic soils in Saskatchewan are largely unknown. Existing literature indicated that sodium may accumulate in solonetzic soils from either present groundwater conditions (hydromorphic), past groundwater conditions (paleohydromorphic), or saline parent materials (lithogenic). Part one of the objectives was to investigate and determine the hydrogeology {{in relation to the}} genesis of solonetzic soils at one site in southern Saskatchewan. An intensive hydrogeological investigation was conducted near Assiniboia, Saskatchewan. Groundwater chemistry, groundwater flow, depth to watertable, and chemistry of geologic strata were studied. Six pedological sites were identified; Orthic Brown soils (site 1 and 4) were found on upper slopes, Alkaline Solonetz soils (sites 3 and 6) on lower slopes, and Brown Solodized Solonetz (site 2) and Brown Solonetz soils (site 5) on mid to lower slopes. Two geologic cross sections were completed and a nest of piezometers and an observation well was installed at each site. The Orthic Brown soil, at site 1, occurred in a groundwater recharge area while the Alkaline <b>Solonetz</b> <b>soil,</b> at site 3, occurred in a groundwater discharge area. Brown Solodized Solonetz (site 2), Orthic Brown (site 4), Brown Solonetz (site 5), and Alkaline Solonetz (site 6) soils occurred in areas of seasonal groundwater recharge and discharge. Part two of the objectives was to document the hydrogeology, from existing data, for selected solonetzic areas south of Township 40. The Hanley, Central Butte, Radville, Consul, and Kindersley solonetzic areas were chosen and topographical, pedological, geological and hydrological data were examined. A "most probable" theory of sodium accumulation in the solonetzic areas was discussed. The origin of sodium from discharging saline groundwater (hydromorphic) probably occurred in the Saskatchewan Rivers Plain (between the Allan and Hawarden Hills Uplands), along eastern portions of the Central Butte Plain, along {{the eastern edge of the}} Missouri Coteau (near Radville) and along both sides of the Souris River in the Souris River Plain (near Radville). The origin of sodium from past groundwater discharge (paleohydromorphic) probably occurred in portions of the Hawarden and Allan Hills Upland, along the northern edge of the Missouri Coteau and the Eyebrow Hills Uplands (near Central Butte) and in portions of the Souris River Plain. The origin of sodium from saline parent materials (lithogenic) probably occurred in the Frenchman River Plain, the Snipe Lake Plain, portions of the Central Butte and the Souris River Plains and portions of the Neutral Hills Upland.

40|$|The {{assessment}} {{of soil and}} vadose zone as the drains for carbon sink and proper modeling of the effects and extremes of biogeochemical cycles in the terrestrial biosphere are the key components to understanding the carbon cycle, global climate system, and aquatic and terrestrial system uncertainties. Calcium carbonate equilibrium causes saturation of solution with CaCO 3, and it determines its material composition, migration and accumulation of salts. In a solution electrically neutral ion pairs are formed: CaCO 3 0, CaSO 4 0, MgCO 3 0, and MgSO 4 0, as well as charged ion pairs CaHCO 3 +, MgHCO 3 +, NaCO 3 −, NaSO 4 −, CaOH +, and MgOH +. The calcium carbonate equilibrium algorithm, mathematical model and original software to calculate the real equilibrium forms of ions and to determine the nature of calcium carbonate balance in a solution were developed. This approach conducts the quantitative {{assessment of}} real ion forms of solution in <b>solonetz</b> <b>soil</b> and vadose zone of dry steppe {{taking into account the}} ion association at high ionic strength of saline soil solution. The concentrations of free and associated ion form were calculated according to analytical ion concentration in real solution. In the iteration procedure, the equations were used to find the following: ion material balance, a linear interpolation of equilibrium constants, a method of ionic pairs, the laws of initial concentration preservation, operating masses of equilibrium system, and the concentration constants of ion pair dissociation. The coefficient of ion association γ e was determined as the ratio of ions free form to analytical content of ion γ e [*]=[*] C ass ∕ C an. Depending on soil and vadose zone layer, concentration and composition of solution in the ionic pair's form are 11 – 52 % Ca 2 +; 22. 2 – 54. 6 % Mg 2 +; 1. 1 – 10. 5 % Na +; 3. 7 – 23. 8 HCO 3 −, 23. 3 – 61. 6 % SO 4 2 −, and up to 85. 7 % CO 3 2 −. The carbonate system of soil and vadose zone water solution helps to explain the evolution of salted soils, vadose and saturation zones, and landscape. It also helps to improve the soil maintenance, plant nutrition and irrigation. The association of ions in soil solutions is one of the drivers promoting transformation of solution, excessive fluxes of carbon in the soil, and loss of carbon from soil through vadose zone...|$|E
