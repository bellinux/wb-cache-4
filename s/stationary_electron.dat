5|$|The inert pair {{effects in}} livermorium should be even {{stronger}} than for polonium {{and hence the}} +2 oxidation state becomes more stable than the +4 state, which would be stabilized only by the most electronegative ligands; this {{is reflected in the}} expected ionization energies of livermorium, where there are large gaps between the second and third ionization energies (corresponding to the breaching of the unreactive 7p1/2 shell) and fourth and fifth ionization energies. Indeed, the 7s electrons are expected to be so inert that the +6 state will not be possible to attain. The melting and boiling points of livermorium are expected to continue the trends down the chalcogens; thus livermorium should melt at a higher temperature than polonium, but boil at a lower temperature. It should also be denser than polonium (α-Lv: 12.9g/cm3; α-Po: 9.2g/cm3); like polonium it should also form an α and a β allotrope.

5|$|The valence {{electrons}} of moscovium fall into three subshells: 7s (two electrons), 7p1/2 (two electrons), and 7p3/2 (one electron). The first {{two of these}} are relativistically stabilized and hence behave as inert pairs, while the last is relativistically destabilized and can easily participate in chemistry. (The 6d electrons are not destabilized enough to participate chemically, although this may still be possible in the two previous elements nihonium and flerovium.) Thus, the +1 oxidation state should be favored, like Tl+, and consistent with this the first ionization potential of moscovium should be around 5.58eV, continuing the trend towards lower ionization potentials down the pnictogens. Moscovium and nihonium both have one electron outside a quasi-closed shell configuration that can be delocalized in the metallic state: thus they should have similar melting and boiling points (both melting around 400°C and boiling around 1100°C) due {{to the strength of}} their metallic bonds being similar. Additionally, the predicted ionization potential, ionic radius (1.5Å for Mc+; 1.0Å for Mc3+), and polarizability of Mc+ are expected to be more similar to Tl+ than its true congener Bi3+. Moscovium should be a dense metal due to its high atomic weight, with a density around 13.5g/cm3.

40|$|Ultrafast time-resolved x-ray {{scattering}} is an emerging approach to image the dynamical {{evolution of the}} electronic charge distribution during complex chemical and biological processes in real-space and real-time. Recently, the differences between semiclassical and quantum-electrodynamical (QED) theory of light-matter interaction for scattering of ultrashort x-ray pulses from the electronic wavepacket were formally demonstrated and visually illustrated by scattering patterns calculated for an electronic wavepacket in atomic hydrogen [G. Dixit, O. Vendrell, and R. Santra, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 109, 11636 (2012) ]. In this work, we present {{a detailed analysis of}} time-resolved {{x-ray scattering}} from a sample containing a mixture of non-stationary and <b>stationary</b> <b>electrons</b> within both the theories. In a many-electron system, the role of scattering interference between a non-stationary and several <b>stationary</b> <b>electrons</b> to the total scattering signal is investigated. In general, QED and semiclassical theory provide different results for the contribution from the scattering interference, which depends on the energy resolution of the detector and the x-ray pulse duration. The present findings are demonstrated by means of a numerical example of x-ray time-resolved imaging for an electronic wavepacket in helium. It is shown that the time-dependent scattering interference vanishes within semiclassical theory and the corresponding patterns are dominated by the scattering contribution from the time-independent interference, whereas the time-dependent scattering interference contribution do not vanish in the QED theory and the patterns are dominated by the scattering contribution from the non-stationary electron scattering...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} the non-equilibrium evolution of magnetic field structures {{at the onset}} of large-scale recombination of an inhomogeneously-ionised plasma. The context for this is the Universe during the epoch of recombination. The electromagnetic treatment of this phase transition can produce energetic electrons scattered throughout the Universe, localised near the edges of magnetic domains. This is confirmed by a numerical simulation in which a mag-netic domain is modelled as a uniform field region produced by a thin surrounding current sheet. Conduction currents sustaining the magnetic structure are removed as the charges com-prising them combine into neutrals. The induced electric field accompanying the magnetic collapse is able to accelerate ambient <b>stationary</b> <b>electrons</b> (that is, electrons not participating in the current sheet) to energies of up to order 10 keV. This is consistent with theoretical pre-dictions. The localised electron acceleration leads to local imbalances of charge which has implications for charge separation in the early Universe...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} that solar hard X-ray bremsstrahlung {{is produced by}} acceleration of <b>stationary</b> <b>electrons</b> by fast-moving protons, rather than vice versa, as commonly assumed, was investigated.

Allowance for the different degrees of target ionization appropriate to the two models (for conventional flare geometries) makes the proton beam model more efficient than the electron beam model, by a factor of order three. The model places less stringent constraints than a conventional electron beam model on the flare energy release mechanism. It is also consistent with observed X-ray burst spectra, intensities, and directivities. The altitude distribution of hard X-rays predicted by the model agrees with observations only if nonvertical injection of the protons is assumed. The model is inconsistent with gamma-ray data in terms of conventional modeling...|$|R
