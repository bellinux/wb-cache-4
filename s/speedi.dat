25|$|On 23 March 2011, {{ten days}} after the {{hydrogen}} explosions, {{the recommendations of the}} Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan to protect the people living near the exploded Fukushima reactors were put aside by the Japanese government. The proposed measures were based on the results provided by a computer program named <b>SPEEDI</b> (System for Prediction of Environmental Emergency Dose Information). This program was specially designed to predict the spread of radioactive materials after a nuclear accident. The proposed measurements included evacuations and administering iodine tablets to people to minimize their intake of radioactive iodine. However, the office of the Prime Minister decided that {{ten days after}} the explosions it was too late, and did not act on the proposals. These facts came to light in the first weeks of December 2011, when a government panel examined the details about the delay in utilizing the data produced by <b>SPEEDI.</b>|$|E
25|$|In April 2012 the {{government}} of the evacuated city of Namie bought a whole-body dosimeter. The device was installed in a temporary housing in Nihonmatsu, Fukushima, in order to monitor the internal radiation exposure and the health of the citizens of Namie. Some 50 people a day could be examined, a complete screening would take two minutes per person. Initial screenings of the whole population was planned to be finished {{at the end of the}} fiscal year 2012. In this way {{the government}} of Namie wanted to offer a long-term monitoring program to the population. Another reason for this was excessive exposure to radiation during the first days directly after the nuclear disaster in March 2011, when predictions from <b>SPEEDI</b> were ignored by the Fukushima Prefectural government.|$|E
25|$|Starting at 22 March 2011 TEPCO {{compiled}} a radiation {{map of the}} surroundings of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. At 150 spots around the buildings the radiation was monitored. This map, the governmental data provided by <b>SPEEDI</b> (System for Prediction of Environmental Emergency Dose Information) and the data of the Japan Meteorological Agency's were shared– the same day– to the United States and other international institutes. On 23 March, a day later, NISA was informed. Almost every day TEPCO officials and NRC staffers continued to share updated versions of the map by e-mail. The information was kept secret for the Japanese public until 24 April 2011, only after the media reported details of the map on 23 April 2011, a day earlier.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of March 15, Prime Minister Kan called Seiki Soramoto, who used to design nuclear plants for Toshiba, to ask for his help in {{managing}} the escalating crisis. Soramoto formed an impromptu advisory group, which included his former professor at the University of Tokyo, Toshiso Kosako, a top Japanese expert on radiation measurement. Mr. Kosako, who studied the Soviet response to the Chernobyl crisis, said he was stunned at how little {{the leaders in the}} prime minister’s office knew about the resources available to them. He quickly advised the chief cabinet secretary, Yukio Edano, to use <b>SPEEDI,</b> which used measurements of radioactive releases, as well as weather and topographical data, to predict where radioactive materials could travel after being released into the atmosphere.|$|E
2500|$|The Japanese {{government}} did not keep records of key meetings during the crisis. Data from the <b>SPEEDI</b> network were emailed to the prefectural government, but not shared with others. Emails from NISA to Fukushima, covering 12 March 11:54PM to 16 March 9AM and holding vital information for evacuation and health advisories, went unread and were deleted. The data was not used because the disaster countermeasure office regarded the data as [...] "useless because the predicted amount of released radiation is unrealistic." [...] On 14 March 2011 TEPCO officials were instructed {{not to use the}} phrase [...] "core meltdown" [...] at press conferences.|$|E
2500|$|Data on the {{dispersal}} of radioactive materials were {{provided to the}} U.S. forces by the Japanese Ministry for Science {{a few days after}} March 11; however, the data was not shared publicly until the Americans published their map on March 23, at which point Japan published fallout maps compiled from ground measurements and <b>SPEEDI</b> the same day. According to Watanabe's testimony before the Diet, the US military was given access to the data [...] "to seek support from them" [...] {{on how to deal with}} the nuclear disaster. Although SPEEDI's effectiveness was limited by not knowing the amounts released in the disaster, and thus was considered [...] "unreliable", it was still able to forecast dispersal routes and could have been used to help local governments designate more appropriate evacuation routes.|$|E
2500|$|Radiation {{levels in}} Tokyo on 15 March were {{at one point}} {{measured}} at 0.809μSv/hour although they were later reported to be at [...] "about twice the normal level". Later, on 15 March 2011, Edano reported that radiation levels were lower and the average radiation dose rate over the whole day was 0.109μSv/h. The wind direction on 15 March dispersed radioactivity away from the land and back over the Pacific Ocean. On 16 March, the Japanese radiation warning system, <b>SPEEDI,</b> indicated high levels of radioactivity would spread further than 30km from the plant, but Japanese authorities did not relay the information to citizens because [...] "the location or the amount of radioactive leakage was not specified at the time." [...] From 17 March, IAEA received regular updates on radiation from 46 cities and {{indicated that they had}} remained stable and were [...] "well below levels which are dangerous to human health". In hourly measurements of these cities until 20 March, no significant changes were reported.|$|E
2500|$|The {{data were}} not {{forwarded}} to the prime minister's office and the Nuclear Safety Commission, and subsequently not used to direct the evacuation of the people living around the plant. Because {{a substantial portion of}} radioactive materials released from the plant went northwest and fell onto the ground, and some residents were [...] "evacuated" [...] in this direction, these people could have avoided unnecessary exposure to radiation had the data been published directly. According to Tetsuya Yamamoto, chief nuclear safety officer of the Nuclear Safety Agency, [...] "It was very regrettable that we didn't share and utilize the information." [...] But an official of the Science and Technology Policy Bureau of the technology ministry, Itaru Watanabe, said it was more appropriate for the United States, rather than Japan, to release the data. On 23 March - after the Americans - Japan released its own fallout maps, compiled by Japanese authorities from measurements and predictions from the computer simulations of <b>SPEEDI.</b> On 19 June 2012 Minister of Science Hirofumi Hirano said that Japan would review the decision of the Science Ministry and the Nuclear-Safety Agency in 2011 to ignore the radiation maps provided by the United States. He defended his ministry's handling of the matter with the remark that its task was to measure radiation levels on land. But the government should reconsider its decision not to publish the maps or use the information. Studies would be done by the authorities, whether the maps could have been a help with the evacuations.|$|E

50|$|The {{government}} {{recommendation that}} people voluntarily evacuate from {{places in the}} 20-30 km range from the Fukushima Daiichi plant came after the Nuclear Safety Commission watchdog released forecasts based on <b>SPEEDI</b> measurements.

At times the objects traveled slowly; at other times they reversed direction and moved across the radarscope at speeds calculated at up to 7,000 mph. At 11:30 p.m., two U.S. Air Force F-94 Starfire jet fighters from New Castle Air Force Base in Delaware arrived over Washington.

There had been weather targets on the scope too, he said, but this was a common occurrence and the controllers [...] "were paying no attention to them." [...] Two more F-94s from New Castle Air Force Base were scrambled during the night. One pilot saw nothing unusual; the other pilot saw a white light which [...] "vanished" [...] when he moved towards it.

40|$|Atmospheric {{dispersion}} code system <b>SPEEDI</b> (System for Prediction of Environmental Emergency Dose Information) {{has been applied}} to simulate the field experiments conducted over a complex terrain. Two series of tracer release expperiments conducted during stable atmospheric cnditions have been considered for the present study. A diagnostic mass consistent wind field model of the code system simulates the flow over an isolated hill using the routinely measured data from SODARs and meteorological tower. An objective basis for the adjustment of the horizontal and vertical wind components has been incorporated in the model and the results show a great improvement in modelling the flow past the hill. Calculated profiles of the vertical velocity component around the hill have been compared with those observed by the SODARs. The model stream lines show closer agreement with the tetroon trajectory and the ground level concentration patterns. Dispersion calculations are carried out using a Lagrangian particle random walk model and the dispersion parameters obtained from the earlier local field experiment are used in the model. The code is modified in order to utilise the observed turbulence data and the later scheme performs better in simulating high values of the concentrations observed near the source. Summary of the results of all the cases suggests that the accuracy of the code system improves significantly when all these changes are introduced. Problems yet to be resolved characteristics of this terrain are also discussed in this report. (orig.)

40|$|A {{polygonal}} differential inclusion system (SPDI) is a non-deterministic planar {{hybrid system}} {{which can be}} represented by piecewise constant differential inclusions. In this thesis we are concerned with several theoretical and practical questions related to SPDIs such as reachability analysis and phase portrait construction. First we show that the reachability question for SPDIs is indeed decidable. Our procedure {{is not based on}} the computation of the reach-set but rather on the computation of the limit of individual trajectories. A key idea is the use of edge-to-edge one-dimensional affine Poincaré maps, the fix-points of which are easily computed. By taking advantage of this information, cycles can be accelerated in most cases. The above reachability algorithm has been implemented in a tool called <b>SPeeDI.</b> We next build the phase portrait of such systems. In particular, we identify the viability kernels of simple cycles. Such kernels are the set of starting points of trajectories that can keep rotating in the cycles forever. We also introduce the notion of controllability kernel of simple cycles as the set of points such that any two points of the set are reachable from each other via trajectories that remain on the set. We give non-iterative algorithms to compute both kernels. We obtain the SPDI phase portrait computing all the viability and controllability kernels. We finally study the decidability of the reachability problem for other 2 -dimensional hybrid systems. We introduce hierarchical piecewise constant derivative systems (HPCDs) and 2 -dimensional manifolds with piecewise constant derivative systems. We show that the reachability problem for the above two classes of systems is as hard as the reachability problem for piecewise affine maps that is known to be an open problem. We also show that the reachability question for slight extensions of HPCDs are undecidable...|$|E
