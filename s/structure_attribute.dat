We examine resource management in family firms and thus explore the unique characteristics of five resources and attributes of family firms that provide potential advantages over nonfamily firms.

40|$|Abstract. In recent years, we have {{reported}} uncooled microbolometer with amorphous vanadium-tungsten oxide as a thermometric material. The reported tungsten-doped vanadium oxide showed very high TCR over- 3. 0 %/K compared with common vanadium oxide, which generally has the TCR values near- 2. 0 %/K. In this work, we characterized properties of electrical conductivity of amorphous tungsten-doped vanadium oxide by investigating electronic structure between vanadium oxide and tungsten-doped vanadium oxide. Finally, {{it is concluded}} that tungsten addition into vanadium give rise to changes of electronic structure when pure vanadium is oxidized and this changes of electronic <b>structure</b> <b>attribute</b> to electrical properties such as high TCR values of vanadium-tungsten oxide...|$|E

40|$|XML {{has gained}} {{prominence}} as data storage and exchange format for web applications. This {{is because there}} are certain features which are unique to XML like self descriptivism, extensibility and non proprietary text document storage. In spite of all these unique features XML has an inherent limitation of verbosity. This size problem of XML should be dealt with efficiently so that a good compression is achieved {{and at the same}} time the compressed data is directly queriable i. e. it should not require decompression at the time of querying. The proposed technique creates a new query engine based on novel three dimensional indexes consisting of <b>structure,</b> <b>attribute</b> and content index. The structure index consists of all unique root to leaf paths of the XML document, the content index stores the contents path wise i. e. all the contents of one particular type of path class is stored in one file and attribute index is created in manner similar to that of content index. Based on this three dimensional compact storage a new query engine is proposed which can answer xpath queries very efficiently. This approach dramatically reduces the storage requirement for XML coupled with efficient processing of xpath queries...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Secure and verifiable data {{transfer}} {{is needed in}} every distributed systems. Currently the attribute based encryption mechanism is used on which the encryption and decryption is based on user attributes. A promising application of ABE is flexible access control of encrypted data stored in the cloud, using access policies and ascribed attributes associated with private keys and ciphertexts. This technique is considered in many cloud storage and computing applications. But the main efficiency drawback is that the decryption will be complex and time consuming with the access structure of attributes. Inorder to overcome this overhead for users the proposed system is using an outsourced decryption which possess only a small computation overhead for recovering the plaintext [...] This system also guarantees the verifiability. Informally, verifiability means that a user can efficiently check whether the transformation is done correctly. This system also proposes a mechanism for identifying whether data stored in cloud is modified or not. Security can also be achieved since the untrusted server, cloud {{is not able to}} learn anything about the encrypted data. Thus the system is verifiable and secure without relying on random oracles. Sensitive data can transferred confidently with the implementation of the proposed mechanism. Index Terms- access control, access <b>structure,</b> <b>attribute</b> based encryption, random oracles, verifiability. 1...|$|E

The original proposition does not give many details on the whole framework, and especially on the possible ways of implementing the similarity operation. There exists an alternative definition without any reference to pattern structures, {{and we would like}} to make a parallel between two points of view. Moreover we discuss an efficient implementation of the intersection operation in the corresponding pattern structure. Finally, we discovered that pattern <b>structures</b> for <b>structured</b> <b>attribute</b> sets are very well adapted to the classification and the analysis of RDF data. We terminate the paper by an experimental section where it is shown that the provided implementation of pattern <b>structures</b> for <b>structured</b> <b>attribute</b> sets is quite efficient...|$|R

40|$|A {{critical}} component of the forest ecosystem, the understorey supports {{the vast majority of}} wildlife habitat and total ecosystem floristic diversity. Remote sensing data have been developed to provide information at different scales for surveys of forest ecosystems, but obtaining information about the understorey remains a challenge. As rapid and efficient tools for forest <b>structure</b> <b>attribute</b> estimation, Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) and Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) have attracted much attention. We examine the relationship between ALS and TLS data and detect changes in the forest understorey caused by forest-tending events in the study area. We conducted trials in five plots within a young Khasi pine (Pinus kesiya Royle ex Gord.) plantation in Yunnan province, China, before and after forest tending. We collected bi-temporal ALS data in this area and TLS data from 10 scanning stations. Canopy height profiles were retrieved from ALS and TLS data, and understorey material volume retrieved from filled TLS voxels volume agreed well with the understorey point clouds percentile distribution (PD) obtained from ALS data. The PD value for the understorey from ALS multiplied by the percentage of ALS return points in the overstorey had a stronger correlation (R 2 = 0. 90) with the TLS-derived understorey material volume than did the ALS PD value for the understorey only (R 2 = 0. 71). Taking the effect of the overstorey into consideration will improve evaluations of forest understorey parameters from ALS data. This study confirmed the potential of TLS as a validation tool to assess the accuracy of forest understorey material volume estimation at large scales using ALS data...|$|E
40|$|Wetland loss due {{to human}} impacts {{is a global}} concern. For certain {{regulated}} activities in the United States, the Clean Water Act § 404 requires replacement of aquatic functions through compensatory mitigation. In spite of the existing mitigation framework and a 2008 Compensatory Mitigation Final Rule updating regulatory guidance, concerns exist regarding {{the effectiveness of the}} compensatory mitigation program. This dissertation contributes to mitigation improvement through three studies. First, we evaluated numbers, sizes, and compensation types of § 404 projects permitted before (2002 - 05) and after (2009 - 13) the Mitigation Rule to determine how its compensation hierarchy was implemented in southern California. Contrary to expectations, the proportion of third party mitigation projects, and of corresponding acres, decreased after the Rule. Within permittee-responsible mitigation, the proportion of off-site projects increased, as predicted. While is it possible the compensation hierarchy influenced these trends, external factors, particularly the national economic downturn, may also have contributed to the patterns observed. Secondly, we developed chronosequence stream restoration performance curves from projects of different ages to illustrate likely developmental trajectories of high-performing restored streams. The curves, developed using California Rapid Assessment Method (CRAM) data, predicted the time required for projects to achieve reference-level scores for the CRAM index and Hydrology and Biotic Structure attributes, but underestimated the time for projects to achieve the Physical <b>Structure</b> <b>attribute</b> reference level. CRAM-based performance curves could be used to guide standard development, and to predict future project performance. Finally, we developed an aerial imagery assessment method (AIAM) that combines landscape, hydrology, and vegetation observations into one index describing overall ecological condition of non-confined streams. Verification of AIAM demonstrated sites in good condition (as assessed on-site by CRAM) received high AIAM scores, and select components of AIAM and CRAM were highly correlated. AIAM-based time-series trajectories of three projects revealed they improved in condition after restoration, with the most dynamic change over time in vegetation characteristics. AIAM has high potential as an ecological assessment tool to determine restoration status and trajectories, and can be used for restoration management. The findings and tools produced here can improve mechanisms and methods of wetland replacement through compensatory mitigation...|$|E
