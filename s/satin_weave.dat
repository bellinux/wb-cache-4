2500|$|The {{original}} and most formal model of dinner jacket is the single-breasted model. The typical black-tie jacket is single-breasted with one button only, with [...] and is of black or midnight blue; usually of wool or a wool–mohair, or wool-polyester blend, although other materials, especially silk, are seen. Although other materials are used, {{the most appropriate}} and traditional for the dinner jacket are wool barathea or superfine herringbone. Double breasted models are less common, but considered equally appropriate. Dinner jackets were commonly ventless before World War I, but today come ventless, with side vents, or with center vents. The ventless style is considered more formal, whilst the centre vent is the least formal. The lapels (traditionally pointed and shawl) are usually faced with silk in either a grosgrain or a <b>satin</b> <b>weave,</b> but can also be silk barathea. According to the Black Tie Guide, the peaked lapel and shawl collar are equally authentic and correct. The buttons should be covered in similarly coloured material to {{the main part of}} the jacket, which would ideally be either self-faced or covered with the same material as the lapels. Some higher-end single-breasted jackets, both new and vintage, tend to be fastened with a link front closure which is visually similar to a cufflink; this method of closure is still common in the United Kingdom.|$|E

Woven fabrics have been specifically configured as a balanced weave thereby allowing systematic investigation of the effect of uniaxial tensile stress on the weave.

Cylindrical projectiles of the same cross-section perimeter were also employed to identify the influence of projectile geometry. In addition, <b>satin</b> <b>woven</b> composites were tested for comparison with respect to failure modes and damage shape. Experimental {{results indicate that the}} main failure modes for the two different fiber reinforcement architectures are similar, that is, fiber shear failure and matrix crush failure in the impact surface and fiber tensile failure, fiber pull-out, matrix cracking, and delamination in the exit surface. The damage area in the exit surface is diamond-shaped for <b>satin</b> <b>woven</b> composites while rounded or elliptic for triaxial braided composites according to projectile geometry. The triaxial braided composites have an improved ballistic resistance and higher ballistic limit than <b>satin</b> <b>woven</b> composites.

30|$|Plain, twill and <b>satin</b> <b>woven</b> fabrics of cotton, {{polyester}} and polyester-cotton of 150  g/m 2 and 200  g/m 2 {{have been}} used to study their suitability for surgical gowns before and after application of flouropolymer and antibacterial finishes. Different concentration levels of fluoropolymer and antibacterial finishes were used to find the level of finishes required for different AAMI protection levels along with their durability using standard laundering cycles. It is observed that all the fabrics except 150  g/m 2 cotton fabric, can be used for AAMI protection level 1 only without any finish. The water repellence of fabrics increases on application of fluoropolymer finish. 4 % fluoropolymer finish on these fabrics {{can be used to make}} them suitable for AAMI protection level 2. Increasing fluropolymer concentration level further increases the hydrostatic pressure but does not make them suitable for protection level 3 and therefore are not recommended for critical areas of the surgical gown. Twill woven fabrics of 200  g/m 2 show highest hydrostatic pressure, but higher stiffness and low air permeability make them quite uncomfortable for longer duration usage. Satin fabrics are more comfortable offering higher air permeability and lower stiffness, but show lowest hydrostatic pressure values and therefore offer minimal water repellence. Repeated laundering cycles lead to reduction in the barrier resistance of fabrics. It is observed that 150  g/m 2 polyester and twill woven 200  g/m 2 cotton fabrics with 4 % fluoropolymer finish maintain their AAMI protection level 2 upto 20 washing cycles. <b>Satin</b> <b>woven</b> fabrics treated with 4 % fluoropolymer finish can maintain AAMI protection level 2 upto 5 washing cycles only. 1.5 % antibacterial finish is sufficient to inhibit the growth of S. aureus bacteria for all fabric samples and this antibacterial activity is maintained upto 20 washing cycles for all fabrics.|$|R

30|$|Among 150  g/m 2 fabrics of {{different}} materials (i.e. sample A, B and C) air permeability is highest for 100 % polyester filament fabric because of smooth and hairiness free yarns (Table  3). Hairy yarns in 100 % cotton and cotton blends offers more {{resistance to air flow}} and therefore lead to lower air permeability. Among plain, twill and satin fabrics of 200  g/m 2 weight (i.e. sample D, E and F), <b>satin</b> <b>woven</b> fabric offers highest air permeability, whereas twill fabric shows the least. This {{is due to}} the longer floats and larger pore sizes (Table  2) in satin structure. Twill fabric with compact structure offer the lowest air permeability. Further, air permeability decreases as the fabric weight increases due to compact structure with smaller pores and higher thickness.|$|R
