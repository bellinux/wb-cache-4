5|$|Another {{possible}} {{argument that}} has been proposed by C. S. Lewis is the Argument from Reason: if, as monism implies, all of our thoughts are the effects of physical causes, then {{we have no reason}} for assuming that they are also the consequent of a reasonable ground. Knowledge, however, is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if monism is correct, there would be no way of knowing this—or anything else—we could not even <b>suppose</b> <b>it,</b> except by a fluke.|$|E

If the coin is flipped a number of times and the outcomes observed, that degree of belief may rise, fall or remain the same depending on the results.|$|E

25|$|In 1738, Montagu {{wrote to}} Harley {{explaining}} {{that she had}} no desire for men or marriage. She saw marriage as a rational and expedient convention and did not <b>suppose</b> <b>it</b> possible to love a man. In 1742 she married Edward Montagu, grandson of the Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich, who owned numerous coal mines and had several rents and estates in Northumberland. She was twenty-two and he was fifty years old. The marriage was advantageous, but it was apparently not very passionate. All the same, she bore a son, John, the next year, and she loved her child immensely. When he died unexpectedly in 1744, she was devastated. She and Edward remained friendly throughout their remaining time together, but there were no more children or pregnancies. Prior to the loss of her son, she had not been very religious, but his death brought her to consider religion more and more. Meanwhile, her sister, Sarah Scott, was growing increasingly devout.|$|E
25|$|Kempe {{also showed}} {{correctly}} that G {{can have no}} vertex of degree 4. As before we remove the vertex v and four-color the remaining vertices. If all four neighbors of v are different colors, say red, green, blue, and yellow in clockwise order, we look for an alternating path of vertices colored red and blue joining the red and blue neighbors. Such a path is called a Kempe chain. There may be a Kempe chain joining the red and blue neighbors, {{and there may be}} a Kempe chain joining the green and yellow neighbors, but not both, since these two paths would necessarily intersect, and the vertex where they intersect cannot be colored. <b>Suppose</b> <b>it</b> is the red and blue neighbors that are not chained together. Explore all vertices attached to the red neighbor by red-blue alternating paths, and then reverse the colors red and blue on all these vertices. The result is still a valid four-coloring, and v can now be added back and colored red.|$|E

Swift's lack of control over the publication lead to Swift complaining of [...] "mangled and murdered Pages". This was one of many reasons that Swift turned from Motte as his printer and sought a printer willing to produce his complete works without content removal. On 9 October 1733, Swift wrote: [...] "Now, you may please to remember how much I complained of Motts suffering some friend of his (I <b>suppose</b> <b>it</b> was Mr Took a Clergy-man now dead) not onely to blot out some things that he thought might give offence, but to insert a good deal of trash contrary to the Author's manner and Style, and Intention." ...|$|E

[...] Jane Grigson wrote of it, [...] "An Omelette and a Glass of Wine is different from any other book by Elizabeth David. Yet in a sense it includes them, holds them together.

500|$|Critical {{reception}} of The Secret Service has been mostly negative. Gerry Anderson, however, {{said that it}} was his favourite of all the series that he had produced. Leo Eaton, who directed four episodes, has referred to The Secret Service as [...] "just a bit weird" [...] and questioned the effectiveness of Unwin's humour. Production manager Desmond Saunders' verdict was [...] "strange. I <b>suppose</b> <b>it</b> was the gobbledegook and the mixture of live action with puppets. It never {{seemed to me to be}} a very good idea." [...] In discussing the production of the series on the website TVCentury21.com, Simon Wickes judges the premise [...] "very strange", and suggests that The Secret Service was made first and foremost to bridge the Andersons' Supermarionation series and their subsequent efforts in live action. Kif Bowden-Smith of the Transdiffusion website concurs with this latter point, describing the mix of puppetry and live action as [...] "an experimental format for the following live-action series".|$|E
500|$|In 1857, Marley {{published}} {{a paper in}} the Transactions of the Institution of Mining Engineers on the Cleveland Ironstone, which begins: [...] "To {{the members of this}} Institute, this ironstone cannot but be an interesting subject, whether they be mining engineers, coal owners, iron masters, or simply a part of the public personally disinterested, as I believe that nothing has been discovered, within the last twenty years, having so direct an influence on the landed, railway, and mineral wealth, in the North of England, on the South Durham coal field, and on the iron trade generally, as the discovery and application of this large ironstone district." [...] Marley continued: [...] "I <b>suppose</b> <b>it</b> may now be taken as an admitted fact, that the prosperity or depression of the iron and coal trades regulates, in a very material degree, the prosperity or depression of nearly all other commercial pursuits in the same locality." ...|$|E
500|$|In November, [...] "Apples and Oranges" [...] was {{released}} {{as a single}} but failed to chart at all. The band eventually went back to De Lane Lea and recorded the unreleased track [...] "Vegetable Man". Sometime around Christmas, David Gilmour (Barrett's old school friend) was asked to join the band as a second lead guitarist to cover for Barrett when his erratic behaviour prevented him from performing. As Barrett had, up until then, written (or co-written) most of the songs on the band's debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, {{as well as the}} band's three singles up to this point, the initial plan was to keep him in the group as a non-touring member – in similar style to Brian Wilson's recent status in The Beach Boys – but this meant that Barrett and the group were essentially separated. For two days from 10 January 1968, Pink Floyd reconvened at EMI Studios, attempting to work on older tracks: Waters' vocals and Wright's organ were overdubbed onto [...] "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun", while Mason added vocals to [...] "Scream Thy Last Scream". Upon leaving Pink Floyd, Barrett said to Melody Maker: [...] "I <b>suppose</b> <b>it</b> was really just a matter of being a little offhand about things".|$|E

500|$|The club's poor run of form {{continued}} in their next home match against Watford, as they suffered their fifth straight defeat and slipped {{to the bottom}} of the league table. Another 3–1 defeat, against Newcastle United, was followed by a second successive 1–0 home defeat against Nottingham Forest, to leave Argyle with just two points from their first seven matches. Paul Sturrock kept faith with the young defensive pairing of James Chester and Shane Lowry for their next game against Peterborough United, and two second-half goals Mackie and Rory Fallon secured Argyle's first three points of the new season. [...] "It's nice to get three points, but now we have to build on it," [...] said Sturrock. [...] "There's no point in us getting this result and then kicking ourselves in the teeth again." [...] Argyle earned their first home win of the season four days later against Scunthorpe United. A penalty from Judge gave the hosts a 2–1 win after Fallon's opening goal was cancelled out by Scunthorpe striker Gary Hooper. Their upturn in results was halted by Blackpool, who won 2–0 at Bloomfield Road. The hosts opening goal was scored by Marcel Seip, a player on loan from Argyle. He took part in the match following a request from former manager Ian Holloway, a decision which was criticised by supporters but defended by senior Argyle officials. [...] "I <b>suppose</b> <b>it</b> was bound to happen that Marcel would score the goal, but I don't think we should look on it as anything other than probably the cover should have been better," [...] said executive director Keith Todd. [...] "We understood exactly what we are doing." ...|$|E
500|$|Around Christmas 1967, guitarist David Gilmour, an {{old friend}} of Barrett's from Cambridge, was asked by the other members of Pink Floyd to join as a second guitarist, {{initially}} to not replace Barrett, but to cover for him, because his unpredictable behaviour prevented him from performing. For several shows Gilmour sang and played guitar while Barrett wandered around on stage, every now and then deciding to join in playing guitar and singing. Waters and fellow band members keyboardist Richard Wright and drummer Nick Mason soon grew weary of Barrett's on-stage antics and, on 26 January 1968, when Waters was driving his bandmates from London to a show at Southampton University, they all agreed to go without Barrett: according to Gilmour's recollection, one person asked, [...] "Shall we pick Syd up?" [...] and another said, [...] "Let's not bother." [...] Since Barrett had written or co-written 10 of the 11 songs on their debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, as well as the band's three singles up to this point, the original plan was to keep him in the group as a non-touring member − in a similar arrangement to what The Beach Boys had done with Brian Wilson − but this soon proved to be unworkable. At his last rehearsal with the band, he presented a new song entitled [...] "Have You Got It Yet?", which proved to be deliberately unplayable as the others attempted to join in, until they realised the joke of the title. On 6 April, the group officially announced that Barrett was no longer a member of Pink Floyd. Upon leaving the Floyd, Barrett said to Melody Maker: [...] "I <b>suppose</b> <b>it</b> was really just a matter of being a little offhand about things".|$|E
