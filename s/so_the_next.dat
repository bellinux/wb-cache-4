5|$|Bowling {{was elected}} Grand President of Kappa Kappa Psi in 1941 and {{presented}} {{a plan to}} hold a national intercollegiate band concert, modeled after the Rocky Mountain intercollegiate bands. The delegation endorsed the plan, {{which was to be}} executed at the next biennial national convention in Stillwater in 1943, the silver jubilee of the fraternity. However, due to World War II, the 1943 and 1945 national conventions were not held, and <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> biennial convention was held in 1947. The first National Intercollegiate Band gave a concert on the evening of Friday, March 7, 1947. All delegates, officers, and visitors to the convention performed in the ensemble, which was augmented by Kappa Kappa Psi members from the Oklahoma A Symphonic Band so the band had a balanced instrumentation.|$|E

Hitler ordered brutal reprisals that resulted in the execution of more than 4,900 people. Though Himmler was embarrassed by his failure to uncover the plot, it led to an increase in his powers and authority.|$|E

5|$|By mid-September, Grant warned Boutwell {{to be on}} {{his guard}} as the gold price {{continued}} to rise, while the conspirators bought ever more and the rising price affected the wider economy. Grant, seeing that the increase was unnatural, told Boutwell to sell gold, which reduced its price. Boutwell did <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day, on September 24, 1869, later known as Black Friday. The sale of gold from the Treasury defeated Gould's scheme as the gold price plummeted, relieving the economic tension. This caused a mild recession, but by January 1870, the economy resumed its post-war recovery. Gould and Fisk managed to escape without much harm to themselves. A Congressional investigation followed, chaired by James A. Garfield and cleared Grant of wrongdoing, but excoriated Gould and Fisk for their manipulation of the gold market and Corbin for exploiting his personal connection to Grant.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{wrote to}} Spargo on September 18, stating that his {{commission}} had approved {{the head of}} Allen but was dissatisfied with the lettering. Spargo had mentioned that President Coolidge liked the Bennington Monument, and Moore stated that the Fine Arts Commission was anxious to get right a coin for the president's state of birth; Fry, he wrote, had the talent to design a handsome coin, but had not done <b>so.</b> <b>The</b> <b>next</b> day, Spargo replied, hopeful that they would soon resolve the dispute. He stated that the Sesquicentennial Commission felt that designs other than the monument would not do; for example, {{the use of a}} Green Mountain Boy would both require stretching history and risk charges of imitating the Minuteman seen on the Lexington-Concord Sesquicentennial half dollar, issued earlier in 1925. He was also unwilling to have a two-headed coin, as such a design combined with the depiction of Allen would be. Spargo suggested that Moore put his objections in writing and be as clear as possible to induce Fry to continue with the project, because the sculptor wanted to withdraw from it. Despite conciliatory efforts, Fry refused to continue, and after the failure of brief negotiations with Theodore Spicer-Simson, the Vermont commission engaged Charles Keck.|$|E
5|$|Unbeknownst to the Japanese however, Chiang {{had already}} ordered Tang {{to abandon the}} defense. In spite of his earlier talk about holding out in Nanking to the bitter end, Chiang telegraphed an order to Tang on December 11 to abandon the city. Tang {{prepared}} to do <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day on December 12, but startled by Japan's intensified onslaught he made a frantic last-minute bid to conclude a temporary ceasefire with the Japanese through German citizens John Rabe and Eduard Sperling. Only {{when it became clear}} that the negotiations could not be completed in time did Tang finally finish drawing up a plan calling for all his units to launch a coordinated breakout of the Japanese encirclement. They were to commence the breakout under cover of darkness at 11:00 pm that night and then muster in Anhui. Just after 5:00 pm on December 12 Tang arranged for this plan to be transmitted to all units, and then he crossed the Yangtze River, escaping through the city of Pukou on the opposite bank of the river less than twenty-four hours before it was occupied by Japan's Kunisaki Detachment.|$|E

5|$|Coulter's plan {{to attack}} on August 28 {{had to be}} postponed. Major General Kim Hong Il, the ROK I Corps commander, {{told him he could}} not attack, that there were too many {{casualties}} and the South Korean were exhausted. The NK 5th Division above P'ohang-dong had begun to press south again and the ROK 3rd Division in front of it began to show signs of pulling back. On the 28th, the KMAG adviser to the ROK 3rd Division, at a time he deemed favorable, advised South Korean Brigadier General Kim Suk Won, the division commander, to counterattack, but Kim refused to do <b>so.</b> <b>The</b> <b>next</b> day Kim {{said he was going to}} move his command post out of P'ohang-dong. The KMAG adviser replied that the KMAG group was going to stay in P'ohang-dong. Upon hearing that, Kim became hysterical but decided to stay for the time being to avoid loss of face. That day, August 28, Walker issued a special statement addressed to the ROK Army, and meant also for the South Korean Minister of Defense, Shin Sung-mo. He called on the ROK troops to hold their lines in the Pusan Perimeter, and implored the rest of the UN troops to defend their ground as firmly as possible, counterattacking as necessary to prevent the North Koreans from consolidating their gains.|$|E
5|$|While {{approximately}} 35,000 Serb refugees, trapped {{with the}} surrendered ARSK Kordun Corps, were evacuated to Yugoslavia via Sisak and the ZagrebBelgrade motorway, {{the bulk of}} the refugees followed a route through the Republika Srpska, arriving there via Dvor in Banovina or via Srb in Likatwo corridors to Serb-held territory in Bosnia and Herzegovina left as the HV advanced. The two points of retreat were created {{as a consequence of the}} delay of a northward advance of the HV Split Corps after the capture of Knin, and the decision not to use the entire HV 2nd Guards Brigade to spearhead the southward advance from Petrinja. The retreating ARSK, transporting large quantities of weaponry, ammunition, artillery and tanks, often intermingled with evacuating or fleeing civilians, had few roads to use. The escaping columns were reportedly intermittently attacked by CAF jets, and the HV, trading fire with the ARSK located close to the civilian columns. The refugees were also targeted by ARBiH troops, as well as by VRS jets, and sometimes were run over by the ARSK Special Units Corps' retreating tanks. On 9 August, a refugee convoy evacuating from the former Sector North under the terms of the ARSK Kordun Corps' surrender agreement was attacked by Croatian civilians in Sisak. The attack caused one civilian death, many injuries and damage to a large number of vehicles. Croatian police intervened in the incident after UN civilian police monitors pressured them to do <b>so.</b> <b>The</b> <b>next</b> day, US ambassador Galbraith joined the column to protect them, and the Croatian police presence along the planned route increased. The refugees moving through the Republika Srpska were extorted at checkpoints and forced to pay extra for fuel and other services by local strongmen.|$|E
25|$|Some systems {{started the}} count with 1 Imix', {{followed}} by 2 Ik', 3 Ak'b'al, etc. up to 13 B'en. The day numbers then start again at 1 while the named-day sequence continues onwards, <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> {{days in the}} sequence are 1 Ix, 2 Men, 3 K'ib', 4 Kab'an, 5 Etz'nab', 6 Kawak and 7 Ajaw. With all twenty named days used, these now began to repeat the cycle while the number sequence continues, <b>so</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day after 7 Ajaw is 8 Imix'.
