5|$|In 1935, Barbera {{created his}} first solo-effort <b>storyboard</b> about a {{character}} named Kiko the Kangaroo. The storyline was of Kiko {{in an airplane}} race with another character called Dirty Dog. Terry declined to produce the story. In his autobiography, Barbera said of his efforts..."I was, quite honestly, {{not in the least}} disappointed. I had proven to myself that I could do a <b>storyboard,</b> and that I had gained the experience of presenting it. For now, that was enough."The original <b>storyboard,</b> which had been passed down through the Barbera family, went on sale at auction in November 2013.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Overtoom, supervising director, Alan Smart, and Tom Yasumi {{served as}} the special's {{animation}} directors while Luke Brookshier and Nate Cash handled the <b>storyboard</b> direction. It {{was a part of}} the series' tenth anniversary celebration.|$|E
5|$|Instead of a {{conventional}} script, the pair pitched the pilot by recording reels of its <b>storyboard,</b> which Povenmire then mixed and dubbed to produce action and vocals. The network approved the show for a 26-episode season. Povenmire left Family Guy to create the series.|$|E

40|$|<b>Storyboards</b> {{are used}} in user-centred design (UCD) to clarify a {{scenario}} that describes the future use of a system. Although there are many styles of <b>storyboarding,</b> the graphical notation and language are very accessible for all team members of a multidisciplinary team. This papers describes how principles and techniques from comics can facilitate <b>storyboarding</b> in our COMuICSer approach and tool. COMuICSer formalises the way that <b>storyboards</b> are created, while preserving creative aspects of <b>storyboarding.</b> In combination with tool support for COMuICSer, this simplifies the relation of <b>storyboards</b> with other artefacts created in UCD such as structured models and UI designs and supports communication in multidisciplinary teams...|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} scenes that {{appeared}} in the <b>storyboard</b> and animatic were reordered or dropped altogether in {{the final version of the}} episode. Much of the Maggie subplot, for example, was modified before the episode aired. A scene in which the babies lock Ms. Sinclair in her office is missing from the final version of the episode.|$|E
5|$|As {{a former}} comic strip illustrator, Deven used the <b>storyboard</b> {{technique}} {{to develop the}} film. Cinematography was handled by Arthur A. Wilson and editing by G. Sasikumar. P. Krishnamoorthy was signed up as the film's art director. S. Naveen, who later directed Moodar Koodam (2013), worked as an assistant director in the film. The dialogues for the film were written in chaste Tamil. Research was conducted at the Roja Muthiah Research Library.|$|E
5|$|During the San Diego Comic-Con, it was {{announced}} that a reunion between Zuko and his mother, Ursa, had been arranged and made into a <b>storyboard.</b> However, it was dropped just before the finale was finished, as requested by show co-creator Michael Dante DiMartino, who felt that it resolved Ursa's disappearance in an unsatisfactory way and that wasn't the way the story should be told.|$|E
50|$|For motion pictures, some filmmakers, directors, and {{producers}} {{choose to use}} clip-art computer programs designed to create <b>storyboards,</b> or use a dedicated 3D <b>storyboarding</b> software, or a more multi-purpose 3D program which {{can also be used}} to create elements of the <b>storyboards.</b>|$|R
50|$|The special was {{directed}} by Osamu Dezaki, an experienced anime director who had previously <b>storyboarded</b> several episodes of Lupin The Third Part I. In addition Dezaki created the <b>storyboards</b> under the pseudonym Makura Saki, something he commonly did despite being well known for creating his own <b>storyboards.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A common {{misconception}} is that <b>storyboards</b> are {{not used}} in theatre. Directors and playwrights frequently use <b>storyboards</b> as special tools to understand {{the layout of the}} scene. The great Russian theatre practitioner Stanislavski developed <b>storyboards</b> in his detailed production plans for his Moscow Art Theatre performances (such as of Chekhov's The Seagull in 1898). The German director and dramatist Bertolt Brecht developed detailed <b>storyboards</b> as part of his dramaturgical method of [...] "fabels." ...|$|R
5|$|In addition, Pixar {{also created}} a short film titled George & A.J., written and {{directed}} by <b>storyboard</b> artist Josh Cooley. This shows what the two Shady Oaks retirement home workers did after Carl left with his house. It was initially available for purchase at the iTunes Store and then was later posted to Disney·Pixar's Facebook and YouTube pages.|$|E
5|$|Pather Panchali did {{not have}} a script; it was made from Ray's {{drawings}} and notes. Ray completed the first draft of the notes during his sea voyage to and from London in 1950. Before principal photography began, he created a <b>storyboard</b> dealing with details and continuity. Years later, he donated those drawings and notes to Cinémathèque Française.|$|E
5|$|Plot {{elements}} for the episode {{date back to}} the original pitch to The Walt Disney Company for the series produced by Povenmire and Marsh. The pitch was constructed of <b>storyboard</b> reels which were recorded and dubbed over by Povenmire for voices, narration, and sound effects. The initial theme song featured an illustration of Phineas and Ferb, wearing their archeologist hats, discovering Candace, dressed in raggy toilet paper.|$|E

50|$|Spanning a {{total of}} 26 episodes, the series was {{produced}} by Nippon Animation and featured the directorial debut of Hayao Miyazaki, who also contributed to character designs and <b>storyboards.</b> Other future prominent anime creators like Isao Takahata (<b>storyboards,</b> directing) and Yoshiyuki Tomino (<b>storyboards)</b> also worked on the series.|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} <b>storyboarding</b> {{has long been}} used in the {{cinematic}} industry for scoping out, through sketches and illustrations, the sequence of narrative activities for film production. More recently, <b>storyboarding</b> has been used for user experience design, multimedia prototyping and mobile app development. This paper describes how researchers in a project team used <b>storyboarding</b> as part of a User-Centred Software Engineering (UCSE) approach to determine stakeholders' needs when designing an internet-independent version of Moodle. <b>Storyboarding</b> proved to be an effective way to capture a wide range of functionality requirements and align project outcome perspectives for the 'ideal product'. Most importantly, the <b>storyboarding</b> process enabled early detection of knowledge gaps and skill sets so that strategies could be devised to bridge the gaps. This paper will outline the <b>storyboarding</b> process, the gaps unearthed and the strategies employed to overcome identified skills and knowledge shortages. ...|$|R
5|$|The DVD release {{included}} a behind-the-scenes featurette, film audio commentary from Mendes and Ball, and a <b>storyboard</b> presentation with discussion from Mendes and Hall. In the film commentary, Mendes refers to deleted scenes {{he intended to}} include in the release. However, these scenes are not on the DVD, as he changed his mind after recording the commentary; Mendes felt that to show scenes he previously chose not to use would detract from the film's integrity.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Casey Alexander, Zeus Cervas, Aaron Springer, Steven Banks, and Paul Tibbitt, and the {{animation}} was directed by Andrew Overtoom and supervising director, Alan Smart. Alexander, Cervas, and Springer also served as <b>storyboard</b> directors on the episode. It features guest appearances by John O'Hurley, Victoria Beckham, and Sebastian Bach. Upon release, the episode was watched by 5.2 million viewers, and met mixed to positive reviews.|$|E
5|$|The miniseries' {{story was}} {{developed}} by head writer Kent Osborne, series showrunner Adam Muto, Jack Pendarvis, and Ashly Burch. <b>Storyboard</b> artists who worked on this miniseries include Sam Alden, Polly Guo, Seo Kim, Somvilay Xayaphone, Tom Herpich, Steve Wolfhard, Graham Falk, Pendleton Ward, Hanna K. Nyström, Aleks Sennwald, Kent Osborne, and Adam Muto. Cole Sanchez and Elizabeth Ito served as the miniseries' supervising directors, and Sandra Lee served as art director.|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{employment}} of digital games for serious purposes such as learning has several prerequisites. Designing {{a game that}} affects human players effectively requires the anticipation of particular human game playing experiences. Recent digital games taxonomies provide the WHAT and <b>storyboarding</b> is the technology for determining the HOW of planning the manifold of potential affective experiences in digital game playing. Game-based learning needs <b>storyboarding</b> and <b>storyboarding</b> needs concepts of digital games taxonomies. The appropriate consolidation of taxonomies and <b>storyboarding</b> results in explicit media didactics in context...|$|R
40|$|<b>Storyboards</b> offer {{designers}} a way {{to illustrate}} a narrative. Their creation can be enabled by tools supporting sketching or widget collections. As designers often incorporate previous ideas, we contribute the notion of blending the reappropriation of artifacts and their design tradeoffs with <b>storyboarding.</b> We present PIC-UP, a <b>storyboarding</b> tool supporting reappropriation, and report on two studies—a long-term investigation with novices and interviews with experts. We discuss how it may support design thinking, tailor to different expertise levels, facilitate reappropriation during <b>storyboarding,</b> and assist with communication...|$|R
5000|$|Many large budget silent {{films were}} <b>storyboarded,</b> {{but most of}} this {{material}} has been lost during {{the reduction of the}} studio archives during the 1970s and 1980s. Special effects pioneer Georges Méliès is known to have been among the first filmmakers to use <b>storyboards</b> and pre-production art to visualize planned effects. However, <b>storyboarding</b> in the form widely known today was developed at the Walt Disney studio during the early 1930s. In the biography of her father, The Story of Walt Disney (Henry Holt, 1956), Diane Disney Miller explains that the first complete <b>storyboards</b> were created for the 1933 Disney short Three Little Pigs. According to John Canemaker, in Paper Dreams: The Art and Artists of Disney <b>Storyboards</b> (1999, Hyperion Press), the first <b>storyboards</b> at Disney evolved from comic-book like [...] "story sketches" [...] created in the 1920s to illustrate concepts for animated cartoon short subjects such as Plane Crazy and Steamboat Willie, and within a few years the idea spread to other studios.|$|R
5|$|The show borrows {{elements}} and its design style from his Uncle Grandpa short, which was pitched {{to the network}} as a pilot. According to Browngardt, they were unsure about having a series centered on the title character, and felt the monster characters from the pilot had more potential. Character designer Robertryan Cory and David P. Smith (a director and <b>storyboard</b> artist on Dexter's Laboratory and The Powerpuff Girls) were brought on board to help shape the project's development.|$|E
5|$|While at Stanford University, Simon {{worked as}} a {{newspaper}} cartoonist and after graduating became a <b>storyboard</b> artist at Filmation Studios. Simon submitted a spec script for the sitcom Taxi, which was produced, and he later became the series' showrunner. Over the next few years, Simon wrote and produced for Cheers, It's Garry Shandling's Show and other programs, as well as writing the 1991 film The Super.|$|E
5|$|Agent Carter {{was filmed}} over five days, with Gabriel Beristain serving as cinematographer. The budget {{did not allow}} for a <b>storyboard</b> artist to be hired, so D'Esposito, Winderbaum, and Beristain worked {{together}} to plan a shot list for the production using stand-in actors. The stunts were also pre-filmed to show the actors. D'Esposito explained that having the shots planned helped with planning the visual effects for the film. The mid-credits scene with Neal McDonough as Dum Dum Dugan was planned to show the character in a pool, but had to be changed on set to taking place beside the pool when {{it was found that}} the muscle suit McDonough wears to portray the character could not get wet.|$|E
50|$|In 1999 D.W. {{started doing}} <b>storyboards</b> for Disney's One Saturday Morning show Tube Dwellers. For a season his duties {{included}} <b>storyboarding</b> and animatics. For the third season {{he took over}} as director.|$|R
5000|$|Finally, if needed, 3D <b>storyboards</b> {{are created}} (called 'technical previsualization'). The {{advantage}} of 3D <b>storyboards</b> is they show {{exactly what the}} film camera will see using the lenses the film camera will use. The disadvantage of 3D {{is the amount of}} time it takes to build and construct the shots. 3D <b>storyboards</b> can be constructed using 3D animation programs or digital puppets within 3D programs. Some programs have a collection of low-resolution 3D figures which can aid in the process. Some 3D applications allow cinematographers to create [...] "technical" [...] <b>storyboards</b> which are optically-correct shots and frames.|$|R
50|$|<b>Storyboards</b> are now {{becoming}} more popular with novelists. Because most novelists write their stories by scenes rather than chapters, <b>storyboards</b> {{are useful for}} plotting the story in a sequence of events and rearranging the scenes accordingly.|$|R
5|$|Animation {{was handled}} {{overseas}} in South Korea at Rough Draft Studios. Animation directors credited with episodes {{in the fourth}} season included Larry Leichliter, Andrew Overtoom, Smart, and Tom Yasumi. Episodes were written {{by a team of}} writers, which consisted of Casey Alexander, Steven Banks, Mike Bell, Luke Brookshier, Nate Cash, Zeus Cervas, Greenblatt, Tom King, Tim Hill, Kyle McCulloch, Dani Michaeli, Chris Mitchell, Mike Mitchell, Aaron Springer, Tibbitt, Vincent Waller, Tuck Tucker, and Erik Wiese. The <b>storyboard</b> directors for this season were Alexander, Bell, Brookshier, Cash, Cervas, Greenblatt, King, Chris Mitchell, Springer, Tuck Tucker, Brad Vandergrift, Waller, and Wiese.|$|E
5|$|Barbera took art {{classes at}} the Art Students League of New York and the Pratt Institute and was hired {{to work in the}} ink and paint {{department}} of Fleischer Studios. In 1932, he joined the Van Beuren Studios as an animator and <b>storyboard</b> artist. He worked on cartoon series such as Cubby Bear and Rainbow Parades, and Tom and Jerry. This Tom and Jerry series starred two humans; it was unrelated to Barbera's later cat-and-mouse series. When Van Beuren closed down in 1936, Barbera moved over to Paul Terry's Terrytoons studio.|$|E
5|$|Co-writer Theroux {{revealed}} that the initial script concept was to have actors go to a mock boot camp and return with posttraumatic stress disorder. The final script was developed to satirize Vietnam War films such as Apocalypse Now, Rambo, Missing in Action, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Hamburger Hill, and The Deer Hunter. Theroux pointed out that since viewers had an increased awareness of {{the inner workings of}} Hollywood due to celebrity websites and Hollywood news sources, the script was easier to write. Dialogue for unscripted portions of the <b>storyboard</b> was developed on set by the actors or was improvised.|$|E
40|$|Collaborative <b>storyboarding,</b> an {{emerging}} area of research, entails having groups of users {{work together to}} produce a sequence of user-system interactions. We conducted a study in which groups of designers were asked to construct <b>storyboards</b> using predetermined components. Initial analysis of the study sessions shows {{the emergence of a}} model for collaborative <b>storyboarding,</b> outlining the collaborative phases designers go through. The model can aid those studying design reuse and its supporting tools...|$|R
50|$|The {{process of}} visual {{thinking}} and planning allows {{a group of}} people to brainstorm together, placing their ideas on <b>storyboards</b> and then arranging the <b>storyboards</b> on the wall. This fosters more ideas and generates consensus inside the group.|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} the first book-length critical history of <b>storyboarding.</b> With roots in pre-cinematic {{experiments in the}} moving image, the form rapidly developed alongside animation, culminating in Disney's feature-length Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. William Cameron Menzies similarly advanced the use of <b>storyboarding</b> for live-action cinema, although {{it was just one}} of his methods of production design for Gone with the Wind, often mistakenly described as a completely <b>storyboarded</b> film. Equally controversial is Alfred Hitchcock's use of <b>storyboards,</b> as for the notoriously problematic shower scene in Psycho. The form came to greater attention in the late 1970 s in the 'cinema of effects' of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas; and with the emergence of today's new digital technologies, <b>storyboarding</b> has never been more prominent. This book examines all of these developments and more, drawing on archival research and illustrated with images from the beginnings of cinema to the present day...|$|R
