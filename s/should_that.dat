25|$|Some systems, {{known as}} {{millivolt}} control systems, extend the thermocouple concept to both {{open and close}} the main gas valve as well. Not only does the voltage created by the pilot thermocouple activate the pilot gas valve, it is also routed through a thermostat to power the main gas valve as well. Here, a larger voltage is needed than in a pilot flame safety system described above, and a thermopile is used rather than a single thermocouple. Such a system requires no external source of electricity for its operation and thus can operate during a power failure, provided that all the other related system components allow for this. This excludes common forced air furnaces because external electrical power is required to operate the blower motor, but this feature is especially useful for un-powered convection heaters. A similar gas shut-off safety mechanism using a thermocouple is sometimes employed {{to ensure that the}} main burner ignites within a certain time period, shutting off the main burner gas supply valve <b>should</b> <b>that</b> not happen.|$|E
25|$|In 1535 {{the abbey}} was valued in the Valor Ecclesiasticus {{as having an}} income of £540, a very {{comfortable}} sum, which leads one to wonder {{how many of the}} abbey's financial problems were due to bad management. This figure meant that Vale Royal escaped being dissolved {{under the terms of the}} First Suppression Act, King Henry VIII's initial move in the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The last abbot was John Hareware (elected 1535), who had previously been abbot of Hulton Abbey. He pursued a two-pronged policy of attempting to ensure the survival of his abbey and, <b>should</b> <b>that</b> fail, the security of himself and his brethren thereafter. He bribed courtiers, influential nobles and in particular chief minister Thomas Cromwell with money and property in the hope of gaining respite; he also leased out most of the abbey lands to friends and associates of the monastery to keep them out of royal hands should the abbey fall (many of these leases had a clause which stated that they should be void if the abbey survived). He began to realise the other assets such as livestock and timber for cash.|$|E
