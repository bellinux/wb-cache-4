5|$|Most {{shots are}} saved with the arms or the hands, but goalkeepers {{are known to}} save <b>shots</b> <b>with</b> their faces and even feet.|$|E
5|$|The {{first cut}} of X2 was rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America, due to violent <b>shots</b> <b>with</b> Wolverine when Stryker's army storms the X-Mansion. A few seconds were cut {{to secure a}} PG-13 rating.|$|E
5|$|The film {{contains}} around fifty <b>shots</b> <b>with</b> computer-generated imagery. Alfredson {{wanted to}} make them very subtle and almost unnoticeable. The sequence where multiple cats attack Virginia, {{one of the most}} complicated scenes to film, required several weeks of drafting and planning. The crew used a combination of real cats, stuffed cats and computer-generated imagery.|$|E
50|$|Whilst the {{cinematography}} is by Andrew Aiello, {{the film}} score is composed by Jesse Clinton. The {{major portion of}} the film has been <b>shot</b> <b>with</b> a handheld camera while the rest have been <b>shot</b> <b>with</b> the tripods.|$|R
5000|$|The {{world record}} for the most {{energetic}} <b>shot</b> <b>with</b> a handheld slingshot was 135 Joules. It was <b>shot</b> <b>with</b> a forward extended slingshot, {{also known as a}} [...] "starship", which achieves more power by increasing draw length.|$|R

5|$|After the {{location}} filming, production {{went back to}} soundstages for interiors. Some scenes were shot against a green screen background for second unit footage of other locations to be substituted, allowing the use of crane <b>shots.</b> <b>With</b> the photography done, Moore took the film to South Korea to edit to prevent Disney from finding out; he also refused to tell most of his close friends what he was doing. Visual effects were done by the same company there that had done them for the 2006 South Korean monster film, The Host.|$|E
5|$|The 24-man {{animation}} {{team was}} {{split into two}} groups. Half {{were assigned to the}} creation of the 15 new CGI creatures populating noitulovE (in Maya), while the other half created the backgrounds (in Houdini). Compositing work – combining the greenscreen <b>shots</b> <b>with</b> stock footage and CGI elements – was performed in Flame and Inferno. As the final commercial was to be shown on cinema screens, the animators worked at a resolution higher than that afforded by the 576i definition used by British PAL-encoded television sets, to improve the appearance of the advert when projected.|$|E
5|$|The Haier Shooting Stars Competition was competed {{between four}} teams of three players, with each team {{representing}} a city which has both NBA and WNBA teams. Each team consisted of one current NBA player, one current WNBA player, and one NBA legend. Team San Antonio, the defending champion, {{was joined by}} the inaugural champion, Team Los Angeles, 2005 champion, Team Phoenix and 2007 champion, Team Detroit. In this competition, each team must make six shots from six shooting locations of increasing difficulties. The team who makes all six <b>shots</b> <b>with</b> the fastest time wins the competition.|$|E

25|$|Hrithik's {{enacting}} of {{a ballet}} sequence with a transparent ball was originally <b>shot</b> <b>with</b> a real ball. However some shots {{needed to have}} a CG ball when it was impractical to execute the <b>shot</b> <b>with</b> a real one. In between the sequence, Hrithik lies on the ball to take a 360-degree turn. This was originally <b>shot</b> <b>with</b> a green cubical turntable to give Hrithik the necessary support to do the act and the table had to be replaced with the transparent ball.|$|R
50|$|Blue Sky {{introduced}} {{a line of}} three natural-functional shots in 2.5 oz. shot bottles in 2010. Blue Energy shot is a natural-energy <b>shot</b> <b>with</b> the same functional ingredients as the original Blue Energy drink. Blue Sky Defense <b>Shot</b> <b>with</b> Energy Support is 100% Fruit Juice {{with the power of}} Blueberry Mangosteen and a unique functional blend including 1000% DV Vitamin C. Blue Sky Defense <b>Shot</b> <b>with</b> Immune Support is 100% fruit juice with the power of Acai Pomegranate and a unique functional blend, including 400mg of Echinacea.|$|R
5|$|The next possession, Kansas' John Parker {{stole the}} ball and crossed half court when coach Harp called a timeout. Chamberlain {{received}} {{the ball in the}} post, went up for a shot and received some contact; however, no referee called a foul and the ball rolled out of bounds off Carolina. The next play, Elstun was run into by a Tar Heel and went to the line for two <b>shots</b> <b>with</b> 31 seconds remaining, where he missed the first and made the second shot. Out of timeouts, Kearns drove into the lane and put up a shot that was blocked out of bounds by Chamberlain. The following play, Quigg pumpfaked and went up for a shot that Chamberlain blocked; however, simultaneously King made contact with Quigg's body while shooting and the referees called a shooting foul. Quigg went to the free throw line for two <b>shots</b> <b>with</b> six seconds to go and made both, which gave the Tar Heels the lead 5453. Kansas called a timeout and in-bounded to Loneski who then passed the ball towards Chamberlain who was under the basket. The pass was under thrown and Quigg tipped the ball away from Chamberlain. Kearns grabbed {{the ball and}} got away from a defender before he threw the ball into the air to run out the clock. Time expired as the ball was in the air and the Tar Heels won the National Championship.|$|E
5|$|The {{visual effects}} supervisor, John Sullivan, hired Arc Productions to create just under 500 <b>shots</b> <b>with</b> {{computer}} generated imagery, between a quarter {{and a third}} of what a blockbuster film would feature. The Covenant that appear are all completely computer generated, as is the academy's space elevator, weapons' muzzle flashes and a few shots of Master Chief. Hendler felt that the visual effects were the area that needed particular focus and spent a much larger percentage of the budget on the Master Chief costume and computer generated imagery than is normal for a production.|$|E
5|$|Unable to find wind {{machines}} {{powerful enough}} to mimic hurricane-force winds, Sertner brought in a jet engine to aim at the actors and props during necessary scenes. Three dimensional storyboards, called animatics, were used to allow the filmmakers {{to see what a}} scene would look like before shooting, using a digital version of the actors. The various weather scenes blended together stock footage of real natural disasters with the computer-generated <b>shots,</b> <b>with</b> care taken to match up the details of the various scenes.|$|E

5|$|Cecil {{decided the}} game would start {{a day before}} the Parisian cafe {{explosion}} in the original game, filling in some of Nicole Collard's back-story. To this end, Cecil also drafted in the acclaimed comic book artist Dave Gibbons, with whom Revolution worked previously on their 1994 cult classic adventure Beneath a Steel Sky. In addition to working on the visual references for the game, Gibbons also produced a comic book to accompany the game's DS release. Gibbons stated {{that he decided to}} return to video game work on this game because he knew producing character <b>shots</b> <b>with</b> a range of expressions would be challenging, and he knew he would enjoy it, based upon past experience.|$|E
5|$|Different {{units of}} the {{regiment}} were stationed at other forts throughout the island {{under the command of}} William P. Burnham. Lieutenant Teófilo Marxuach, the officer of the day, was stationed at El Morro Castle at San Juan Bay on 21 March 1915. The Odenwald, built in 1903 (not {{to be confused with the}} German World War II war ship which carried the same name), was an armed German supply ship which tried to force its way out of the San Juan Bay and deliver supplies to the German submarines waiting in the Atlantic Ocean. Marxuach gave the order to open fire on the ship from the walls of the fort. Sergeant Encarnación Correa then manned a machine gun and fired warning <b>shots</b> <b>with</b> little effect.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs' {{success was}} based on fast footwork, an ability to play many {{different}} shots, and excellent placement of the ball. Among the first batsmen to succeed against previously devastating googly bowlers, he adapted his technique to meet the new styles of bowling that arose early in his career; he mixed classical <b>shots</b> <b>with</b> an effective defence. He was particularly successful on difficult pitches for batting. An opening batsman, Hobbs established several effective opening partnerships; with Tom Hayward and Andy Sandham for Surrey and with Wilfred Rhodes and Herbert Sutcliffe for England. His partnership with Sutcliffe remains in 2016 the most effective for the first wicket, in terms of average partnership, in Test history. Contemporaries rated Hobbs extremely highly, and critics continue to list him among the best batsmen of all time.|$|E

5|$|Houston {{began to}} rebuild, {{bringing}} in young guards Cuttino Mobley and 2000 NBA co-Rookie of the Year Steve Francis. On August 2, 2001, after refusing a $13 million {{deal with the}} Rockets, Olajuwon {{was traded to the}} Toronto Raptors for draft picks (the highest of which was used by Houston to draft Boštjan Nachbar at #15 in the 2002 NBA draft), with the player having a three-year contract that would give him $18 million. Olajuwon averaged career lows of 7.1 points and 6.0 rebounds per game in what would be his final season in the NBA, as he decided to retire in the fall of 2002, due to a back injury. Olajuwon retired as the all–time league leader in total blocked <b>shots</b> <b>with</b> 3,830, although shot blocking did not become an official statistic until the 1973–74 NBA season. Shortly after his retirement, his #34 jersey was retired by the Rockets.|$|E
5|$|Method and Luma {{both worked}} on {{creating}} the various ants {{seen in the}} film, with Method creating the several species of ants, to share among the vendors. Luma also handled many of the scenes at Pym Technologies when Ant-Man attempts to acquire the Yellowjacket. ILM worked on the Falcon fight sequence, having done Falcon visual effects in The Winter Soldier. Using practical suit pieces built by Legacy Effects, ILM mixed live-action <b>shots</b> <b>with</b> digital take-overs and fully digital shots to create the sequence. ILM also handled the sequences in the quantum realm, providing an array of microscopic and largely psychedelic imagery for the subatomic shrinking, taking advantage of procedural fractal rendering techniques the studio had utilized on Lucy.|$|E
5|$|Mike Blaisdell briefly {{returned}} to the club as coach for the 2005–06 season, before being succeeded by Mike Ellis. Ellis made numerous changes to the playing staff and led the Panthers to a fifth place league finish. In the playoffs Nottingham eliminated the Sheffield Steelers and Belfast Giants before defeating the Cardiff Devils to clinch their first playoff title in 18 years. All three ties were decided on penalty <b>shots</b> <b>with</b> goaltender Rastislav Rovnianek saving all seven shots he faced {{during the course of}} the competition. The following season the Panthers won a second Challenge Cup title, defeating the Sheffield Steelers 9–7 on aggregate in the final. This was the first time that the Panthers had won major honours in successive seasons.|$|E

5|$|News of de Barras' {{departure}} led the British {{to realise}} that the Chesapeake was the probable {{target of the}} French fleets. By 31 August Graves had moved his ships over the bar at New York harbour. Taking command of the combined fleet, now 19 ships, Graves sailed south, and arrived {{at the mouth of}} the Chesapeake on 5 September. His progress was slow; the poor condition of some of the West Indies ships (contrary to claims by Admiral Hood that his fleet was fit for a month of service) necessitated repairs en route. Graves was also concerned about some ships in his own fleet; Europe in particular had difficulty manoeuvring. The squadrons' clash started with Marseillois exchanging <b>shots</b> <b>with</b> the 64-gun HMS Intrepid, under Captain Anthony Molloy.|$|E
5|$|No. 266 Squadron was {{the last}} unit to trade <b>shots</b> <b>with</b> German formations. During the battles five Bf 109s were destroyed; two from JG 26 and three from JG 3. A further three Bf 109s were 60, 70 and 80 percent damaged. Four German pilots were killed, one wounded, one {{captured}} and one missing. One {{made it back to}} base where the crippled fighter crash-landed. One JG 3 and one JG 26 Bf 109s fell to Spitfires of 266 Squadron. Three fell to Spitfires of No. 54 Squadron. Bomber losses amounted to eight destroyed and ten damaged; including five Do 17s and two Ju 88s destroyed from KG 76 and two KG 1 He 111 lost.|$|E
5|$|O'Donnell {{attempted}} {{to probe the}} Viet Cong flank, and after locating it on the high ground he committed 1 Platoon—under Second Lieutenant Rod Smith—to conduct a right flanking attack. Beginning at 11:30 the Australian assault soon ran into another Viet Cong platoon conducting a similar manoeuvre, and they became involved in an intense battle at close quarters with each side blocking the manoeuvre of the other. A heavy monsoon rain began, drenching the men as they faced each other at a range of just , with seven Viet Cong machine-guns facing six Australian machine-guns {{at the height of}} the battle as the two Viet Cong platoons clashed with two Australian platoons. The Australians suffered heavily, losing two section commanders killed and a dozen men wounded in the first few minutes. The fighting continued for another two hours as both forces traded <b>shots,</b> <b>with</b> neither the Australians nor the Viet Cong able to achieve a decisive advantage.|$|E
