5|$|In 2000, the U.S. Department of Justice {{completed}} {{the investigation into}} Jowers' claims but did not find evidence to support allegations about conspiracy. The investigation report recommended no further investigation unless some new reliable facts are presented. A sister of Jowers {{admitted that he had}} fabricated the story so he could make $300,000 from selling the story, and she in turn corroborated his story in order to get <b>some</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> pay her income tax.|$|E
5|$|In early July, Anderson's group robbed {{and killed}} several Union sympathizers in Carroll and Randolph counties. On July 15, Anderson {{and his men}} entered Huntsville, Missouri, and {{occupied}} the town's business district. Anderson killed one hotel guest whom he suspected was a U.S. Marshall, but spoke amicably with an acquaintance he found there. Anderson's men robbed the town's depository, gaining about $40,000 in the robbery, although Anderson returned <b>some</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> the friend he had met at the hotel.|$|E
5|$|It {{was very}} soon after their arrival that they {{learned of the}} death of Paul I. Louis hoped that Paul's successor, Alexander I, would {{repudiate}} his father's banishment of the Bourbons (which he later did). Louis XVIII then intended to set off to the Kingdom of Naples. The Count of Artois asked Louis to send his son, Louis Antoine, and daughter-in-law, Marie-Thérèse, to him in Edinburgh, but they did not at this time. Artois had an allowance from King George III of Great Britain and sent <b>some</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> Louis. Louis XVIII's court in exile was being spied on by French police. The court-in-exile was being financed mainly by interest owed from Francis II on valuables his aunt, Marie Antoinette, had removed from France and had to cut its expenses significantly.|$|E

5|$|One day, Rachmat hears {{screaming}} and finds Atikah, who has fainted after seeing a snake. After she regains consciousness, Atikah thanks him for rescuing her. Although Rachmat is disgusted {{that he has}} helped her after learning the identity of Atikah's father, as Rachmat and Atikah dedicate their time to social work, they begin to fall in love. Doerachman, however, disapproves of their relationship, and refuses to fund their work; as a result, Atikah takes her deceased mother's jewellery and <b>some</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> pay for village development. Later, when Rachmat and Atikah are sitting together and singing romantic songs, Mardjan overhears them. Hurrying back to Doerachman's home, Mardjan convinces his boss that Rachmat intends only to steal Doerachman's wealth, and to let Mardjan marry Atikah. As Doerachman prepares to leave, Mardjan has the illiterate hadji put his seal on a letter.|$|E
5|$|The Library of Gray's Inn {{has existed}} {{since at least}} 1555, when the first mention of it {{was made in the}} will of Robert Chaloner, who left <b>some</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> buy law books for the Library. The Library was neither a big {{collection}} nor a dedicated one; in 1568 it was being housed in a single room in the chambers of Nicholas Bacon, a room that was also used for mooting and to store the deed chest. The collection grew larger over the years as individual Benchers such as Sir John Finch and Sir John Bankes left books or money to buy books in their wills, and the first Librarian was appointed in 1646 after members of the Inn had been found stealing books.|$|E
5|$|The Ellesmere Canal {{company had}} been {{constructing}} canals to the west, linking Llangollen to Frankton, but the route from there to Chester had not been decided. In 1796, they obtained an Act of Parliament, authorising a line from near the great aqueduct at Pontcysyllte running roughly northwards through Ruabon, Bersham, Gwersyllt and Pulford to join the River Dee opposite the canal basin at Chester. The Chester company, {{who were trying to}} put their financial affairs into order, noticed that the 1796 Act failed to mention a connection with their canal. They decided to obtain an Act to enforce a connection, and to stop supplying water to the Wirral line. The Ellesmere company responded quickly, agreeing to make changes to their Act, and the Chester company continued to supply water. On the strength of this, they were also able to raise <b>some</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> put the canal into good order and to repay some of their debts. The Ellesmere company extended their canal eastwards from Frankton to Whitchurch, and in 1802, the two companies reached agreement on a line from near Whitchurch to Hurleston Junction, just to the north of Nantwich. It opened on 25 March 1805, and water supply was enhanced by the construction of a navigable feeder through Llangollen to Horseshoe Falls on the River Dee at Llantisilio.|$|E

5|$|Arnold {{returned}} to {{working on the}} hydrogen bomb book, but 1987 was the 30th anniversary of the Windscale accident. Rather than let {{the records of the}} accident and subsequent inquiries be released over several years, Arnold persuaded the Public Records Office to release them all at once. In meetings with the various responsible government agencies, the topic of a book about Windscale came up, and Arnold decided to write one, which became Windscale 1957: Anatomy of a Nuclear Accident in 1992. Gowing, in poor health, retired from the UKAEA in 1993. By this time her two research assistants had also left, and Arnold feared that the UKAEA Council would shut down the hydrogen bomb book project, which she hoped to follow up with one on the UK civil nuclear power programme. The UKAEA Council decided to press on with the project, asking Arnold to stay on although she was now over seventy years old. In 1993, she was joined by Katherine Pyne, an aircraft engineer working on a history degree, who became her research assistant for two years. However, the end was in sight. The UKAEA no longer had responsibility for nuclear weapons, and management was not interested in it. With funds for the project almost exhausted, the UKAEA Council decided that Arnold should retire in 1996. She loaded her notes into her car and took them home. Sympathetic friends at the Ministry of Defence found <b>some</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> cover her expenses, and she doggedly worked on it from home. Britain and the H-Bomb finally appeared in 2001.|$|E

25|$|Under {{the last}} will of Sophia in 1785, more than 50 slaves were emancipated and given <b>some</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> start their freedom. Other slaves bought their emancipation. The {{rest of the}} slaves, roughly a hundred, were {{auctioned}} off together with {{their wives and children}} on January 28, 1786, in front of de Klerk's house. In the same year, Radermacher sold the property to another member of the Council of the Indies, Johannes Siberg.|$|E

25|$|In a pay-to-play gig, the {{performer}} will either pay the promoter <b>some</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> {{be allowed to}} perform at the show, or will have to offer some in-kind payment. In a conventional comedy club, the promoter will pay the acts for their performance, and will raise the money to stage the gig by charging the audience. Some clubs offer open mic slots, where newer acts are allowed to learn the craft, unpaid; {{this is not the}} same as pay-to-play. Many comedians are against pay-to-play schemes, which they consider exploitative.|$|E

25|$|Barrett {{was deeply}} {{involved}} {{in every aspect of}} the Industrial School's program. She personally managed the parole system by which girls who demonstrated sufficient responsibility were placed in carefully selected foster homes. These girls also were given jobs and were supported by follow-up services such as ministerial guidance, a newsletter called The Booster and personal letters. The school operated on an honor system and did not use corporal punishment. A special feature of Barrett's work was that each resident had their own bank account, so that upon discharge each resident had <b>some</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> take with them.|$|E

25|$|However, {{that turned}} out not to be true, as in October 2007 Divac got legally {{registered}} as 100% owner of Voda Voda, a bottled water brand previously owned by businessman Vojin Đorđević. That transaction was also followed by a stir of controversy, as Đorđević publicly accused Divac of deceit, asserting that he broke a gentlemen's agreement they had, and questioning the validity of the contract that Divac presented to the Serbian Business Registers Agency. The circumstances surrounding the deal (as of November 2007) are still unclear: Divac claims that he indeed loaned <b>some</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> the Đorđević's Si company, which was in financial troubles, and after Đorđević failed to fulfill his part of the deal, just used the contract, already properly signed by Đorđević, to claim ownership of the company.|$|E
