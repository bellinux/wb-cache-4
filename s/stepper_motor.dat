25|$|Ball {{bearings}} {{designed to}} support high speeds and temperatures are sometimes {{used instead of}} fluid bearings to support the turbine shaft. This helps the turbocharger accelerate more quickly and reduces turbo lag. Some variable nozzle turbochargers use a rotary electric actuator, which uses a direct <b>stepper</b> <b>motor</b> to open and close the vanes, rather than pneumatic controllers that operate based on air pressure.|$|E
25|$|Diodes are {{frequently}} used to conduct damaging high voltages away from sensitive electronic devices. They are usually reverse-biased (non-conducting) under normal circumstances. When the voltage {{rises above the}} normal range, the diodes become forward-biased (conducting). For example, diodes are used in (<b>stepper</b> <b>motor</b> and H-bridge) motor controller and relay circuits to de-energize coils rapidly without the damaging voltage spikes that would otherwise occur. (A diode used in such an application is called a flyback diode). Many integrated circuits also incorporate diodes on the connection pins to prevent external voltages from damaging their sensitive transistors. Specialized diodes are used to protect from over-voltages at higher power (see Diode types above).|$|E
25|$|<b>Stepper</b> <b>motors</b> {{were and}} still are often used in {{computer}} printers, optical scanners, and digital photocopiers to move the optical scanning element, the print head carriage (of dot matrix and inkjet printers), and the platen or feed rollers. Likewise, many computer plotters (which since the early 1990s have been replaced with large-format inkjet and laser printers) used rotary <b>stepper</b> <b>motors</b> for pen and platen movement; the typical alternatives here were either linear <b>stepper</b> <b>motors</b> or servomotors with closed-loop analog control systems.|$|R

25|$|In modern drives, {{there is}} one head for each {{magnetic}} platter surface on the spindle, mounted on a common arm. An actuator arm (or access arm) moves the heads on an arc (roughly radially) across the platters as they spin, allowing each head to access almost the entire surface of the platter as it spins. The arm is moved using a voice coil actuator or in some older designs a <b>stepper</b> <b>motor.</b> Early hard disk drives wrote data at some constant bits per second, resulting in all tracks having {{the same amount of}} data per track but modern drives (since the 1990s) use zone bit recording – increasing the write speed from inner to outer zone and thereby storing more data per track in the outer zones.|$|E
25|$|Mature axon tracts {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to experience growth when mechanically stretched at the central portion of the axon cylinder. Such mechanical stretch was applied by a custom axon stretch-growth bioreactor composed of four main components: custom-designed axon expansion chamber, linear motion table, <b>stepper</b> <b>motor</b> and controller. The nerve tissue culture is placed within the expansion chamber with a port for gas exchange and a removable stretching frame, which is able to separate two groups of somas (neuron cell bodies) and thus stretch their axons. Collagen gel was used to promote the growth of larger stretch-grown axon tracts that were visible to the unaided eye. There are two reasons for the growth enhancement due to the collagen coating: 1) the culture became hydrophobic after the collagen dried, which permitted a denser concentration of neurons to grow, and 2) the collagen coating created an unobstructed coating across the two elongation substrates. Examination by scanning electron microscope and TEM {{showed no signs of}} axon thinning due to stretch, and the cytoskeleton appeared to be normal and intact. The stretch-grown axon tracts were cultured on a biocompatible membrane, which could be directly formed into a cylindrical structure for transplantation, eliminating the need to transfer axons to a scaffold after growth was complete. The stretch-grown axons were able to grow at an unprecedented rate of 1cm/day after only 8 days of acclimation, which is much greater than the 1mm/day maximal growth rate as measured for growth cone extension. The rate of 1mm/day is also the average transport speed for structural elements such as neurofilaments.|$|E

2500|$|Stepper motors are a type {{of motor}} {{frequently}} used when precise rotations are required. In a <b>stepper</b> <b>motor</b> an internal rotor containing PMs or a magnetically soft rotor with salient poles is controlled {{by a set of}} external magnets that are switched electronically. A <b>stepper</b> <b>motor</b> may also {{be thought of as a}} cross between a DC electric motor and a rotary solenoid. As each coil is energized in turn, the rotor aligns itself with the magnetic field produced by the energized field winding. Unlike a synchronous motor, in its application, the <b>stepper</b> <b>motor</b> may not rotate continuously; instead, it [...] "steps"—starts and then quickly stops again—from one position to the next as field windings are energized and de-energized in sequence. Depending on the sequence, the rotor may turn forwards or backwards, and it may change direction, stop, speed up or slow down arbitrarily at any time.|$|E
2500|$|A {{servo system}} differs from some <b>stepper</b> <b>motor</b> {{applications}} {{in that the}} position feedback is continuous while the motor is running; a stepper system relies on the motor not to [...] "miss steps" [...] for short term accuracy, although a stepper system may include a [...] "home" [...] switch or other element to provide long-term stability of control. For instance, when a typical dot matrix computer printer starts up, its controller makes the print head <b>stepper</b> <b>motor</b> drive to its left-hand limit, where a position sensor defines home position and stops stepping. As long as power is on, a bidirectional counter in the printer's microprocessor keeps track of print-head position.|$|E

2500|$|Seek time is {{a measure}} of how long it takes the head {{assembly}} to travel to the track of the disk that contains data. The first HDD had an average seek time of about 600ms;. [...] Some early PC drives used a <b>stepper</b> <b>motor</b> to move the heads, and as a result had seek times as slow as 80–120ms, but this was quickly improved by voice coil type actuation in the 1980s, reducing seek times to around 20ms. Seek time has continued to improve slowly over time. [...] The fastest server drives today have a seek time around 4 ms. The average seek time is strictly the time to do all possible seeks divided by the number of all possible seeks, but in practice is determined by statistical methods or simply approximated as the time of a seek over one-third of the number of tracks.|$|E
