5|$|During season 2, it is {{revealed}} that Pope {{had been involved}} in an electoral fraud scheme that had ensured Fitz's election. During a break in her relationship with Fitz, Pope develops an emotional and physical attachment to Fitz's Navy colleague Jake Ballard (Scott Foley). Fitz' affair with Pope caused him to become estranged from his wife, Mellie (Bellamy Young), and led to his romantic gesture to move Pope into the White House. However, the season ended with Pope telling Fitz he <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to his wife and run for reelection after Fitz and Pope were driven apart by White House Chief of Staff Cyrus Beene (Jeff Perry). The season ends with a mysterious relationship with her father, Rowan Pope (Joe Morton), coming to the surface.|$|E
25|$|When Titanic sank at 2:20a.m., Boxhall {{suggested}} to the occupants that they <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to pick people {{up from the}} water. However, they refused outright. Boxhall found this puzzling, as {{only a short time}} before the women had pleaded with Smith for their husbands to be allowed to accompany them, yet now {{they did not want to}} go back to save them (although actually only one woman, Mrs. Walter Douglas, had left a husband on board). The boat was the first to reach Carpathia, at 4:10a.m.|$|E

25|$|Originally from Czechoslovakia, she was {{stripped}} of her citizenship when, in 1975 at age 18, she asked the United States for political asylum and was granted temporary residency. At the time, Navratilova {{was told by the}} Czechoslovak Sports Federation that she was becoming too Americanised, and she <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to school and make tennis secondary. Navratilova became a US citizen in 1981, and on January 9, 2008, she reacquired Czech citizenship. She stated she has not renounced her U.S. citizenship nor does she plan to do so, and that reclaiming Czech nationality was not politically motivated.|$|E
25|$|Increasingly paranoid, Norma deduces that Joe and Betty {{are more}} than just friends ("Too Much In Love to Care"). She calls the younger woman to reveal Joe's secret life at the mansion, but he overhears and grabs the phone to tell Betty to come see for herself ("The Phone Call"). Realizing their affair is doomed, Joe brusquely tells her he enjoys being Norma's pet and that she <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to Artie. Betty departs, {{confused}} and brokenhearted, and Joe tells Norma he is leaving her and returning to his hometown in Ohio. He also bluntly informs her that Salome is an unfilmable script and her fans have long abandoned her. Furious and grief-stricken, Norma fatally shoots Joe three times as he storms out of the house.|$|E
25|$|After Japan's {{defeat in}} the Pacific and {{subsequent}} surrender, Shimazaki is conflicted in his loyalties, wondering if he <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to Japan, or stay in the newly proclaimed Republic of Indonesia and fight to defend its sovereignty. At first, he does not abandon his duties to Japan, and refuses to give PETA weapons to the Indonesian guerillas, said weapons having been earmarked for surrender to the Allies. Armed only with bambu runcing (sharpened bamboo spears), these guerillas are easily killed by the returning Dutch forces and their allies. Finally, a group of former PETA soldiers– led by Nurhadi, Parto and Asep– go to the Japanese headquarters to force Shimizaki {{to give them the}} weapons. After a lengthy stand-off, he agrees to surrender the weapons and to accompany the guerrillas in fighting, saying goodbye to his friend Lieutenant Miyata (Naoki Hosaka).|$|E

500|$|Jennings pleased {{some conservatives}} though, after his three-year {{lobbying}} {{effort to create}} a full-time religion correspondent at ABC News succeeded in the hiring of Peggy Wehmeyer in January 1994, making her the first such network reporter. ABC increased its coverage of religious topics, and in March 1995, Jennings anchored Peter Jennings Reporting: In the Name of God, a well-received documentary on the changing nature of American churches. At a taping of a [...] "town meeting" [...] segment for KOMO-TV of Seattle in February 1995, Jennings expressed regret for his ABC radio remarks on the 1994 midterm elections. [...] "People thought I had insulted their sacred mandate and some thought I <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to Canada," [...] he said. [...] "I hope I don't make that mistake again." ...|$|E
500|$|Grant {{took part}} in [...] "Reporters Remember 11-22-63" [...] at Southern Methodist University in Dallas in November 1993. The panel discussion, {{broadcast}} on C-SPAN as Journalists Remember the JFK Assassination, featured {{members of the press}} who spoke of their experiences on the day 30 years earlier that Kennedy was killed. From the dais, Grant offered his memories of the motorcade, and recalled asking his boss afterward if he <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to Washington, D.C., with Kennedy's body and being told no. Grant said he returned to Love Field to retrieve his luggage ahead of a planned visit to Vice President Johnson's ranch nearby; just as he reached the planes he saw Judge Sarah T. Hughes leaving Air Force One. [...] "I'd just missed her swearing in the new president." ...|$|E
500|$|Cope's {{views on}} human races would today be {{considered}} racist, and his beliefs {{were used by}} scientists of the time to justify imperialism. He believed that if, [...] "a race was not white then it was inherently more ape-like". He was not opposed to blacks {{because of the color}} of their skin but their [...] "degrading vices", believing that the [...] "inferior Negro <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to Africa." [...] He did not blame blacks for their perceived [...] "poor virtue", but wrote, [...] "A vulture will always eat carrion when surrounded on all hands by every kind of cleaner food. It is the nature of the bird." [...] Cope was against the modern view of women's rights, believing in the husband's role as protector; he was opposed to women's suffrage, as he felt they would be unduly influenced by their husbands.|$|E

500|$|In 2013, {{the team}} had {{released}} Fuse, which was a critical and commercial failure. The team now reflected on the reasons for its poor reception, and felt that they <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to Insomniac's roots — developing unusual titles with vibrant visuals — instead of another dark shooter like Fuse. They also thought that Sunset Overdrives stylization should reflect {{the personality of the}} company, and that building a world that has a sense of humor and irreverence was something the team was eager to do. Ted Price, CEO of Insomniac Games, described it as a game Insomniac had wanted to develop for a long time. The game's producer, Bryan Intihar, called it: [...] "...the game [...] been meaning to make for 20 years." [...] Microsoft supported it and shared the same vision and the idea of creating something new.|$|E
500|$|Berardinelli said {{director}} Mark Jones has no style {{evident in}} the film. [...] Wilmington {{described it as a}} [...] "dingy, drab, pointless little movie ... made without flair or imagination, seemingly enervated by its own bad taste and low intentions". [...] Canby called the screenplay and direction amateurish, and Hicks wrote that Jones is bereft of ideas and <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to his day job, describing the plot as [...] "by-the-numbers killings with no rhyme or reason". [...] Harrington wrote that the film [...] "has major continuity and credibility problems". [...] Strauss identified the theme as anti-greed but said the writing is [...] "simultaneously prosaic and murky", causing Jones to miss his mark. [...] Wilmington wrote that the leprechaun's cries for his gold reflects the filmmakers' cynical desire for box office success. [...] Sight & Sound described Leprechaun as a film which seems to have no concept of a target audience, stating, [...] "Jones wants this to be a lively romp for older kids in the mould of Time Bandits...but also wants to corner the lucrative horror market." [...] The review concluded, [...] "Unsuitable for adults or kids, this is ultimately for completists." [...] Harrington called the make-up [...] "quite evil-looking", though Strauss wrote that [...] "effects are strictly so-so".|$|E
2500|$|I've {{always thought}} that Roe v. Wade was a wrong decision, that they usurped {{what had been the}} law in this country for 200 years, that it was a matter that <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the states. When you get back to the states, I think the states should have some leeway. [...] I might vote against one approach, but I think the state ought to have it. And I would not be and never have been for a law that says, on the state level, if I were back in Tennessee voting on this...to criminalize a young woman....|$|E

2500|$|The removal by Stein {{of so much}} {{cultural}} and archaeological material from China has caused anger in China, {{and there have been}} calls for the texts and artefacts collected by Stein from Dunhuang that are now in the British Museum and British Library to be repatriated to China.

2500|$|Criticism {{also came}} from Emerson's fellow Conservatives. Garth Turner, a Conservative MP from Ontario said that [...] "anyone who crosses the floor {{ultimately}} <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> {{to the people}} for ratification and I stick by it and hopefully {{in this case that}} will happen..." [...] Turner later stated his belief that his criticism [...] "seriously limited" [...] his future in the party. Subsequently, he was eventually kicked out of the Conservative caucus and crossed the floor to sit as a Liberal for which he was also criticized. Myron Thompson of Alberta has also called for Emerson to step down and run in a by-election.|$|E
2500|$|Weygand {{abandoned}} the northwards counter-offensive over the Somme and Aisne rivers by 1 June but wanted {{the attacks on}} German bridgeheads south of the Somme to continue, as a defensive measure against the expected German offensive against Paris. Georges ordered a pause in the Seventh Army attacks, to regroup ready for an attack on 4 June. [...] became the Tenth Army, which included the 1st Armoured and 51st Highland divisions, in IX Corps, in which the 4e DCr {{was replaced by the}} 31st (Alpine) Division and the [...] (2e DCr). The troops under Beauman were organised as the Beauman Division, with three improvised infantry brigades, an anti-tank regiment, a field artillery battery and service troops. Karslake was informed by the government that ad hoc forces <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to England, with only enough lines-of-communication troops retained to support an armoured division, four infantry divisions and the AASF but Georges persuaded the War Office to keep the Beauman Division on the Andelle–Béthune line.|$|E

2500|$|Eyre and Green {{verbally}} sparred, {{when the}} latter protested {{use of the}} word [...] "annexation" [...] regarding his proposed reapportionment plan. [...] "Use of the word is an absolute fraud, well calculated to mislead people both in the suburbs and in the city", the Democrat said. Eyre forcefully responded: [...] "Bill Green...either <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to school or open a copy of a good dictionary. Webster defines the word annex as a verb meaning 'to attach, join or add, especially something larger'...Annexation it will continue to be as far as hundreds of thousands of residents of suburban Philadelphia counties who object to the Green grab..."Bell presented his own plan, calling for: Philadelphia to give up one seat, preferably Green's; the GOP to yield a seat {{in the western part of}} the state and two districts with evenly balanced voter registration be merged into one. To make matters worse for the G.O.P, a Democratic state senator, Harry E. Seyler presented plans to merge all of Delaware County with Philadelphia for the purpose of congressional redistricting.|$|E
2500|$|The {{situation}} was clearly untenable, and {{so after the}} election of officials to the new government in summer 1869, the Minister of Justice Saga Saneharu {{was put in charge}} of the problem. In a meeting of the legislature that winter, Iwakura Tomomi proposed deliberation over the court dress for governmental officials that Saga and his helpers had come up with. However, as this design was based on the former dress of court nobles, it met with opposition from those of samurai descent. In order to resolve this disorder, the [...] was released on October 17, 1871. In order to quiet the kazoku still attached to traditional styles of dress, the order claimed that ikan and similar kinds of clothing were weak, and Japan <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the styles of the time of Emperor Jimmu and Empress Jingū. The [...] "styles of that time" [...] meant tight sleeves and narrow hakama, and so the order implied that Western-style dress, complying to these standards, had much in common with the essential garb of the Japanese themselves. Calling back to the spirit of Jimmu's legendary founding of the country, it appealed {{for the creation of a}} new uniform.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} of Bianca Jackson has received critical acclaim from critics and fans alike. EastEnders executive producer Diederick Santer has described Bianca as [...] "one {{of the most}} popular characters EastEnders has ever had", while James Rampton, journalist for The Independent, has commented that she is [...] "adored". Palmer has suggested that viewers [...] "rooted" [...] for Bianca because [...] "people love a stroppy girl". In 2000, she commented, [...] " [...] makes them laugh. A character like that is about living out your fantasies. Everybody would love to be like Bianca and really say what they think." [...] Following her exit from the serial in September 1999, Palmer said that members of the public would approach her to plead with her to return to EastEnders, as they missed her character and relationship with Ricky. She commented in 2000, [...] "It makes me feel bad. I sometimes think I <b>should</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> [...] for everyone else's sake." [...] When the character departed the serial in 1999, Molly Blake of the Birmingham Evening Post said [...] "Good riddance!"

When he was half-way down the stairs he halted. She might try to do {{something}} silly--throw herself out of the window or God knows what! He listened attentively; there was no sound. But he pictured her very clearly, tiptoeing across the room, lifting the sash as high as it would go, leaning out into the cold night air. It was raining a little. Under the window lay the paved terrace. How far below? Twenty-five or thirty feet? Once, when he was walking along Piccadilly, a dog had jumped out of a third-storey window of the Ritz. He had seen it fall; he had heard it strike the pavement. <b>Should</b> he <b>go</b> <b>back?</b> He was damned if he would; he hated her.|$|R
