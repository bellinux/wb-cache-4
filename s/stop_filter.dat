This technique provides 42 % reduction of size for the band <b>stop</b> <b>filter</b> and about 26 % for the low pass counterpart. Both the designed structures are fabricated and the measured results are compared with the simulated results.

40|$|Gantry crane is a load-lifting system {{consists}} of three main components which are trolley, bridge and gantry. Gantry {{can be described as}} a supporting structure that is rigidly affixed to hold the trolley’s movement on and parallel to a bridge. However, due to the heavy and bulky size also swaying of the payload during the movement, gantry crane are difficult to control {{in such a way that}} the load reaching the desired destination in minimum time. So, the main purpose of controlling a gantry crane is transporting the load as fast as possible without causing any excessive sway at the final destination by using a two-dimensional gantry crane model and feed forward approach.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{presents}} analysis {{approach and applications}} of symmetrical three-conductor coupled microstriplines with aperture in the ground plane {{for the design of}} microwave filters. Analysis is based on splitting the entire symmetrical three-conductor coupled line struc-ture into simple two-conductor coupled lines. Various possible termina-tions have been shown in three-conductor coupled lines to derive a class of structures for the construction of filters. These coupled line structures are analyzed based on even- and odd-mode propagation characteristics to design filters in this article. An experimental cascaded three-conductor coupled line band <b>stop</b> <b>filter</b> with defected ground has been designed using the method of circuit model analysis. Defected ground has been used under the coupled lines to widen the filter’s bandwidth.

3000|$|The {{occurrence}} of a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA) {{that is in}} reading frame 0 and located inside an exon, or across two exons because of the intron interruption, is called as an [...] "in-frame stop". In general, the occurrences of in-frame stops are considered very rare. We designed our in-frame <b>stop</b> <b>filter</b> to penalize such Viterbi paths. A DNA sequence has six reading frames (read in six ways based on frames), three for the forward strand and three for the reverse strand. When precomputing the emission tables in the above for the sub-states, for those sub-states related to exons we consider the occurrences of in-frame stop codons in the six reading frames. For each reading frame, we scan the DNA sequence from left to the right, and whenever a stop codon is encountered in-frame, we add to the emission probability for that position a user defined stop penalty factor. In this way, the in-frame <b>stop</b> <b>filter</b> procedure is incorporated into the emission table building process and does not bring the additional computational complexity to the program.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, a band <b>stop</b> <b>filter</b> with tunable {{resonant}} frequency and tunable bandwidth is proposed using micro electromechanical (MEMS) switches. The band <b>stop</b> <b>filter</b> {{is based on}} defected ground structures (DGS). Tunability of resonant frequency is achieved through two methods for fine and coarse tuning.

A coarser method of tuning the resonant frequency makes use of two switches connected across the gaps of the DGS.

The bandwidth of the filter is tuned by actuation of MEMS shunt switches, forming a distributed MEMS transmission line (DMTL) in the spacing between the DGS structures.
