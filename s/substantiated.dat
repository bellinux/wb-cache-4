5|$|As of June 23, 2013, the United States Office of Special Counsel is {{investigating}} reports that two schedulers at the Ft. Collins facility were reassigned to Wyoming after {{they refused to}} comply with instructions to falsify information about patient wait times. The VA Office of Medical Inspector has <b>substantiated</b> a report that punitive action was taken against employees who scheduled appointments {{in a way that}} honestly showed that appointments would take place outside of the 14-day window, and the OMI also <b>substantiated</b> reports of other problems at the facility such as a shortage of medical providers and attempts to hide evidence of cancelled appointments.|$|E

5|$|During the war, Mugabe {{remained}} {{suspicious of}} many of ZANLA's commanders and {{had a number of}} them imprisoned. In 1977 he imprisoned his former second-in-command, Wilfred Mhanda, for suspected disloyalty. After Tongogara was {{killed in a car accident}} in 1979, there were suggestions made that Mugabe may have had some involvement in it, although these rumours were never <b>substantiated.</b>|$|E
5|$|Owner Bill Veeck was {{concerned}} the promotion might {{turn into a}} disaster and checked {{himself out of the}} hospital, where he had been undergoing tests.

5|$|The {{number of}} {{personnel}} aboard {{is in some}} doubt, but an estimate of 638 was published in The Times. It is generally thought that the survivors comprised 113 soldiers (all ranks), 6 Royal Marines, 54seamen (all ranks), 7women, 13children {{and at least one}} male civilian, but these numbers cannot be <b>substantiated,</b> as muster rolls and books were lost with the ship.|$|E

5|$|The role of RNA {{interference}} in mammalian innate immunity is poorly understood, and relatively little data is available. However, {{the existence of}} viruses that encode genes able to suppress the RNAi response in mammalian cells may be evidence in favour of an RNAi-dependent mammalian immune response, although this hypothesis has been challenged as poorly <b>substantiated.</b>|$|E
5|$|Within Britain, {{there has}} been {{continuing}} interest in Lucan's fate. Since Rivett's murder, hundreds of reported sightings {{have been made in}} various countries around the world; none have been <b>substantiated.</b> Despite a police investigation and huge press interest, Lucan has not been found and is presumed dead; a death certificate was issued in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Hamilton {{was born}} and spent part of his {{childhood}} in Charlestown, {{the capital of the}} island of Nevis in the Leeward Islands (then part of the British West Indies). Hamilton and his older brother James Jr. (1753–1786) were born out of wedlock to Rachel Faucette, a married woman of half-British and half-French Huguenot descent, and James A. Hamilton, a Scotsman who was the fourth son of Laird Alexander Hamilton of Grange, Ayrshire. Speculation that Hamilton's mother was of mixed race, though persistent, is not <b>substantiated</b> by verifiable evidence.|$|E

5|$|All recent {{specimens}} of the Borneo shark {{have been collected}} solely from fishery landing sites at Mukah in Sarawak, despite thorough surveys across the rest of Borneo (including at the locality of the type specimen). Thus, its range may now be restricted to shallow, inshore waters in northwestern Borneo. Of the five earlier specimens, four came from Borneo and one from Zhoushan Island in China, hinting at a wider historical distribution. This species was also recorded from Borongan in the Philippines in 1895, and Java in 1933; these records cannot be <b>substantiated</b> {{and there have been}} no subsequent sightings from these areas.|$|E
5|$|Carroll Baker {{was born}} and raised in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, in a Roman Catholic family, the {{daughter}} of Edith Gertrude (née Duffy) and William Watson Baker, who was a traveling salesman. She is of Polish descent, which has given rise to a rumor that her birth name was Karolina Piekarski. However, this currently cannot be <b>substantiated</b> by known records. Baker's parents separated when she was eight years old, and she moved with her mother and younger sister, Virginia, to Turtle Creek, Pennsylvania. According to Baker, her mother struggled as a single parent, and the family was poor for much of her upbringing.|$|E
5|$|Jew {{claimed that}} he turned over the money to a man named Robert Chan from a land use {{consulting}} firm called Bridge Consulting, though this was never <b>substantiated.</b> He also asked {{that half of the}} money be donated to the Friends of Sunset Playground, a local organization set up {{to raise money for the}} renovation of a playground at 28th Avenue and Lawton Street.

5|$|The {{marriage}} {{was not a}} success. By the 1840s, Natalie Benjamin was living in Paris with the couple's only child, Ninette, whom she raised as a Catholic. Benjamin would visit them annually. While a senator, in the late 1850s he persuaded Natalie to rejoin him and expensively furnished a home in Washington for all three to live in. Natalie and their daughter soon embarked again for France. Benjamin, publicly humiliated by his failure to keep Natalie, consigned the household goods to auction. There were rumors, never <b>substantiated,</b> both that Benjamin was impotent, and that Natalie was unfaithful.|$|E
5|$|The {{society has}} been {{influential}} {{in the history of}} Georgia Tech. ANAK {{played a major role in}} establishing several of Georgia Tech's most active student organizations – including its yearbook, the Blueprint; its student newspaper, the Technique; and its Student Government Association – as well as several lasting Georgia Tech traditions. The society also claims involvement in a number of civil rights projects, most notably in peacefully integrating Georgia Tech's first African American students and preventing the Ku Klux Klan from setting up a student chapter at Georgia Tech. These claims have yet to be <b>substantiated</b> by independent sources.|$|E
5|$|There are oft-repeated {{historical}} {{claims that}} Joshua Norton arrived in San Francisco {{on a specific}} vessel, the Franzeska, on 23 November 1849; that he arrived with $40,000, {{in whole or in}} part a bequest from his father's estate; and that he parlayed this into a fortune of $250,000. None of this is <b>substantiated</b> by contemporaneous documentation. What is known is that, after Norton arrived in San Francisco, he enjoyed a good deal of success in commodities markets and in real estate speculation, and that by late 1852, he was one of the more prosperous, respected citizens of the city.|$|E

5|$|Wallace, {{who was a}} cadet of the Officers Training Corps, was {{commissioned}} second lieutenant in the 5th Battalion, The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own) on 5 August 1914, while still an undergraduate. There were suggestions {{at the time that}} he was the first undergraduate to go into action but they were not <b>substantiated.</b> After two weeks' training at Sheppey, he departed for France on 30 August. There, he participated in the First Battle of the Aisne and was active on the Western Front at Frelinghien and Ploegsteert Wood.|$|E
5|$|After the Athens Olympics, Thorpe took a {{year away}} from swimming, {{scheduling}} a return for the 2006 Commonwealth Games. However, {{he was forced to}} withdraw due to illness. Subsequent training camps were interrupted, and he announced his retirement in November 2006, citing waning motivation. From early 2011, there was speculation about Thorpe's return to swimming, fuelled by people claiming to have seen him training. The speculations were <b>substantiated</b> when Thorpe spoke at a February 2011 press conference of his return to swimming after four years away, with the aim of competing in the 2012 London Olympic Games. Thorpe competed at Australia's Olympic Trials in 2012, but failed to make the team. It was subsequently announced that he was targeting qualification for the 2013 World Championships in Barcelona and later the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow but was forced to abandon his plans due to a shoulder injury. In 2014, he was presented with a Doctor of Letters from Macquarie University in recognition of his contribution for the sport, philanthropy and Indigenous rights.|$|E
