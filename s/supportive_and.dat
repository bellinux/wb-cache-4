5|$|Greek mythology {{is known}} today {{primarily}} from Greek literature and representations on visual media {{dating from the}} Geometric period from c. 900–800 BC onward. In fact, literary and archaeological sources integrate, sometimes mutually <b>supportive</b> <b>and</b> sometimes in conflict; however, in many cases, {{the existence of this}} corpus of data is a strong indication that many elements of Greek mythology have strong factual and historical roots.|$|E

5|$|A novel {{vaccine for}} dengue fever has been {{approved}} and is commercially available {{in a number of}} countries. Other methods of prevention are by reducing mosquito habitat and limiting exposure to bites. This may be done by getting rid of or covering standing water and wearing clothing that covers much of the body. Treatment of acute dengue is <b>supportive</b> <b>and</b> includes giving fluid either by mouth or intravenously for mild or moderate disease. For more severe cases blood transfusion may be required. About half a million people require admission to hospital a year. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen should not be used.|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} {{a study of the}} place of {{research}} on <b>supportive,</b> palliative <b>and</b> end-of-life care within the United Kingdom Research Assessment Exercise of 2001 and 2008. Sixty-seven Higher Education Institutions in 2001 and 66 in 2008 contributed work to the Research Assessment Exercise relevant to <b>supportive,</b> palliative <b>and</b> end-of-life care. This comprised 16 subject areas in 2001 and 25 in 2008, and was generated by 178 authors in 2001 and 176 authors in 2008. Seven ‘high-intensity groups’ of concentrated research activity were identified in 2001, and eight such groups in 2008. Between the years little growth occurred in contributions to the Research Assessment Exercise relating to <b>supportive,</b> palliative <b>and</b> end-of-life care, and the ‘high-intensity groups’ remain relatively fragile. With one exception, there is no concentration of effort in clinical studies relating to the medical aspects of <b>supportive,</b> palliative <b>and</b> end-of-life care. By 2008 there were still less than 40 university academics in the UK with major commitments to research in <b>supportive,</b> palliative <b>and</b> end-of-life care, as measured by their Research Assessment Exercise participation...|$|R

5|$|Laura Knight {{spent the}} summer of 1908 working on the beaches at Newlyn making studies for her large {{painting}} of children in bright sunlight. The Beach was shown at the Royal Academy in 1909, and was considered a great success, showing Laura painting in a more Impressionist style than she had displayed previously. About this time she began painting compositions {{of women in the}} open air, in the plein-air manner, often on the rocks or cliff-tops around Lamorna. Knight would sometimes use models from London who were prepared to pose nude. Although there was some resentment locally about this, the landowner, a Colonel Paynter, was fully <b>supportive</b> <b>and</b> allowed Knight and the other artists a free rein. Daughters of the Sun, which showed several women, some naked, sitting by a coastal inlet was completed in 1911 and well received when shown at the Royal Academy, but was subsequently damaged and destroyed. In recent years examples of Knight's plein-air compositions from Cornwall have attracted high prices at auction.|$|E
5|$|Males {{establish}} their dominance more forcefully than females. A male disperses, or leaves his natal group and joins another group, after reaching sexual maturity. Adult males are very competitive {{with each other}} and fight for access to females. Higher dominance means better access to mating and earlier access to food, so naturally a great deal of fighting over rank occurs, with younger males constantly trying to rise in position. Because females stay with their groups their entire lives, and males emigrate to others, often a new male challenges an older one for dominance. Frequently, when older baboons drop in the social hierarchy, they move to another tribe. The younger males who pushed them down often bullies and harasses them. Older males tend to have more <b>supportive</b> <b>and</b> equal relationships than those of the younger males. The former may form coalitions against the latter.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} {{psilocybin}} are highly variable and {{depend on the}} mindset and {{environment in which the}} user has the experience, factors commonly referred to as set and setting. In the early 1960s, Timothy Leary and colleagues at Harvard University investigated the role of set and setting on the effects of psilocybin. They administered the drug to 175 volunteers from various backgrounds in an environment intended to be similar to a comfortable living room. Ninety-eight of the subjects were given questionnaires to assess their experiences and the contribution of background and situational factors. Individuals who had experience with psilocybin prior to the study reported more pleasant experiences than those for whom the drug was novel. Group size, dosage, preparation, and expectancy were important determinants of the drug response. In general, those placed in groups of more than eight individuals felt that the groups were less <b>supportive,</b> <b>and</b> their experiences were less pleasant. Conversely, smaller groups (fewer than six individuals) were seen as more supportive. Participants also reported having more positive reactions to the drug in those groups. Leary and colleagues proposed that psilocybin heightens suggestibility, making an individual more receptive to interpersonal interactions and environmental stimuli. These findings were affirmed in a later review by Jos ten Berge (1999), who concluded that dosage, set, and setting were fundamental factors in determining the outcome of experiments that tested the effects of psychedelic drugs on artists' creativity.|$|E
