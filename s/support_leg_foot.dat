2500|$|Continental {{had begun}} {{deploying}} BusinessFirst seats that allowed customers to lie completely flat, reclining 180-degrees and providing [...] of sleeping {{space in the}} fully extended position on its 777-200ER and 757-200 aircraft. The Flat Bed Seat offered a seat measuring up to [...] wide when the adjustable armrest was positioned flush with the seat cushion. Electronic controls enabled customers to easily move the seats to an infinite combination of seat adjustments, including lumbar <b>support,</b> <b>leg</b> and <b>foot</b> rests. iPod connectivity was available in the Flat Bed Seat. The new BusinessFirst seats had a six-way adjustable head rest, an individual overhead reading light and an adjustable seat light allowing customers to read in bed without disturbing their neighbor and a privacy shell that allowed for seclusion from other travelers. BusinessFirst customers also received {{one of the highest}} crew to passenger ratios (1:8) among all international business class products.|$|R
40|$|Background: Athletes {{suffering}} an {{anterior cruciate}} ligament injury tend to exhibit similar body postures that in sidestep cutting are associated with increased knee moments. This relationship, however, has not been investigated in landing. Catching a ball in different overhead positions may affect landing postures and knee joint moments. This study investigated these possible relationships. It was anticipated that some joint postures would be associated increased knee loads during the landing task. Methods: Twenty-five healthy male team sports athletes performed four variations of a landing task. Full body kinematics were identified at initial contact. Peak flexion, valgus and internal rotation moments at the knee, measured during early landing, were normalized to mass and height and statistically compared. Intra-participant correlations were performed between all kinematics and each moment. Mean slopes for each correlation were used to identify the existence of relationships between full body kinematics and knee joint moments. Findings Landing after an overhead catch when the ball moved towards a player 2 ̆ 7 s <b>support</b> <b>leg</b> resulted in increased peak valgus moments. These increased valgus moments were correlated with increased knee flexion, hip flexion, and torso lean, as well as torso rotation towards the <b>support</b> <b>leg,</b> and <b>foot</b> and knee external rotation. Increased internal rotation moments were correlated with reduced hip abduction and external rotation, increased ankle inversion, knee external rotation and torso lean away from the <b>support</b> <b>leg.</b> Interpretation Learning to land with techniques that do not reflect postures associated with high knee moments may reduce an athlete 2 ̆ 7 s risk of non-contact {{anterior cruciate ligament}} injury...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The <b>leg</b> and <b>foot</b> {{abnormalities}} of {{a flock of}} 911 Wrolstad White turkeys were described and were analyzed statistically to determine {{the relationship of the}} incidences of <b>leg</b> and <b>foot</b> abnormalities to sex and body weight of the turkeys. Body weight and a visual observation of the condition of <b>legs</b> and <b>feet</b> of each turkey were recorded at the age of nearly 12 weeks. The sex of each turkey had been recorded at one day of age. Based on chi-square contingency tables, the incidence of the <b>leg</b> and <b>foot</b> abnormalities was related to sex. The male turkeys were far more likely to experience <b>leg</b> and <b>foot</b> abnormalities than were the females. The incidence rate of severe <b>leg</b> and <b>foot</b> abnormalities was 16. 1 % for the males and 4. 8 % for females. The incidence of <b>leg</b> and <b>foot</b> abnormalities was not related to weight per se. The light turkeys of either sex were just as likely as the heavy turkeys of the same sex to have <b>leg</b> and <b>foot</b> abnormalities...|$|R
