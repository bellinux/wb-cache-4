500|$|Prior to the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards, Stuart Levine of Variety {{reviewed}} {{the performances of}} the three cast members nominated in the Outstanding Supporting Actress category. [...] "The ladies of Grey's Anatomy dominate the category, and it'd be far from a stretch to <b>say</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> two of those women rose to high dramatics last season", commented Levine, while praising Sandra Oh for her portrayal of Cristina Yang who endured a tumultuous seasoning relationship, seeing her trepidation at spending a life together with the man she loved. He regarded the appearances of Chandra Wilson as more subdued, though [...] "by no means less well-executed". He deemed Miranda Bailey a rock, being the most level-headed character on the show with a right thing to say in any situation. He expressed admiration towards Chandra Wilson, by describing her as being [...] "flashy and over the top", which he considers better than being consistently good. Considering Heigl's chances of winning the Emmy, Levine assessed of her performance, by remarking the slight difficulty she has in reaching each emotional state Izzie Stevens has to go through: [...] "Showrunner Shonda Rhimes {{puts a lot of}} pressure on Heigl to carry many intense storylines, and she's up to the challenge." [...] However, he also noted that Izzie's irrational actions during crisis situations may be bothering.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{contemporary}} reviewers {{were positive}} and praised her [...] "beautiful prose", {{even though her}} [...] "style is apt to degenerate into over-repetition and confusion". Robert Benchley wrote a parody of The Good Earth that focused on just these qualities. Peter Conn, in his biography of Buck, argues that despite the accolades awarded to her, Buck's contribution to literature has been mostly forgotten or deliberately ignored by America's cultural gatekeepers. Kang Liao argues that Buck played a [...] "pioneering role in demythologizing China and the Chinese people in the American mind". Phyllis Bentley, in an overview of Buck's work published in 1935, was altogether impressed: [...] "But we may <b>say</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> that for the interest of her chosen material, the sustained high level of her technical skill, and the frequent universality of her conceptions, Mrs. Buck is entitled to take rank as a considerable artist. To read her novels is to gain not merely knowledge of China but wisdom about life." [...] These works aroused considerable popular sympathy for China, and helped foment poor relations with Japan.|$|E

Human Rights Watch Report from 1992, Rape in Kashmir: A Crime Of War, states that there are no reliable statistics on the number of rapes committed by the Indian security forces in Kashmir because a significant number of the rapes by Indian security forces have been perpetrated in isolated rural areas of Kashmir which makes it difficult to document all the cases. However, the Human Rights Watch Report states that the use of rape is common and the perpetrators are not punished.|$|E
