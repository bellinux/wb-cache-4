The 6th Division attacked the perimeter defences early on 21 January, following a week of continuous bombardment from both land and sea. The 2/3rd Battalion was tasked with breaching the outer Italian defences for the 2/1st Battalion to pass through. Following the initial breakthrough, the 2/3rd then advanced west along the inner ring of defences, attacking a number of Italian posts as they went. Tobruk fell the next day, with the Italians surrendering to Brigadier Horace Robertson, {{the commander of the}} 19th Brigade.

2500|$|Another {{example of}} prey to {{predator}} communication is the pursuit-deterrent signal. Pursuit-deterrent signals occur when prey indicates to a predator that pursuit would be unproﬁtable because the <b>signaler</b> {{is prepared to}} escape. Pursuit-deterrent signals provide a beneﬁt to both the <b>signaler</b> and receiver; they prevent the sender from wasting time and energy ﬂeeing, and they prevent the receiver from investing in a costly pursuit that is unlikely to result in capture. Such signals can advertise prey’s ability to escape, and reﬂect phenotypic condition (quality advertisement), or can advertise that the prey has detected the predator (perception advertisement). Pursuit-deterrent signals have been reported {{for a wide variety}} of taxa, including ﬁsh (Godin and Davis, 1995), lizards (Cooper et al., 2004), ungulates (Caro, 1995), rabbits (Holley 1993), primates (Zuberbuhler et al. 1997), rodents (Shelley and Blumstein 2005, Clark, 2005), and birds (Alvarez, 1993, Murphy, 2006, 2007). A familiar example of quality advertisement pursuit-deterrent signal is stotting (sometimes called pronking), a pronounced combination of stiff-legged running while simultaneously jumping shown by some antelopes such as Thomson's gazelle in the presence of a predator. At least 11 hypotheses for stotting have been proposed. A leading theory today is that it alerts predators that the element of surprise has been lost. Predators like cheetahs rely on surprise attacks, proven by the fact that chases are rarely successful when antelope stot. Predators do not waste energy on a chase that will likely be unsuccessful (optimal foraging behaviour). [...] Quality advertisement can be communicated by modes other than visual. [...] The banner-tailed kangaroo rat produces several complex foot-drumming patterns in a number of different contexts, one of which is when it encounters a snake. [...] The foot-drumming may alert nearby offspring but most likely conveys vibrations through the ground that the rat is too alert for a successful attack, thus preventing the snake's predatory pursuit.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a general model that covers signaling {{with and without}} conflicts of interest between <b>signalers</b> and receivers. Krebs and Dawkins (1984) argued that a conflict of interests will lead to an evolutionary arms race between manipulative <b>signalers</b> and sceptical receivers, resulting in ever more costly signals; whereas common interests will lead to cheap signals or "conspiratorial whispers. " Previous simulation models {{of the evolution of}} communication have usually assumed either cooperative or competitive contexts. Simple game-theoretic and evolutionary simulation models are presented; they suggest that signaling will evolve only if it is in the interests of both parties. In a model where <b>signalers</b> may inform receivers as ro the value of a binary random variable, if signaling is favored at all, then <b>signalers</b> will always use the cheapest and the second cheapest signal available. Costly signaling arms races do not get started. A more complex evolutionary simulation is described, featuring continuously variable signal strengths and reception thresholds. As the congruence of interests between the parties becomes more clear-cut, successively cheaper signals are observed. The findings support a modified version of Krebs and Dawkins's argument. Several variations on the continuous-signaling model are explored. ...|$|R

Here, we examine several well-studied cases of acoustic synchrony in Neoconocephalus katydids (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae), a New World genus wherein males broadcast loud advertisement songs. We report that call synchrony found in N. spiza and N. nebrascensis results from two rather different mechanisms of rhythm adjustment. Moreover, synchrony in the former species appears to represent an incidental byproduct of signal competition between evenly matched males, whereas in the latter species synchrony functions as a specific adaptation in which cooperating males ensure that critical call features can be perceived by females.

40|$|My {{dissertation}} evaluated {{whether the}} palaces built in Florence, Italy during the Renaissance are {{a form of}} costly signaling. Costly signaling theory was developed to explain why organisms have attributes and behaviors that appear to defy basic Darwinian logic by having costs that are not offset by obvious benefits. The theory proposes that such attributes and behaviors persist because they are reliable signals {{of information about the}} <b>signalers.</b> Signal audiences use the information content of signals to rank <b>signalers</b> and to modify their interactions with <b>signalers</b> in ways that benefit <b>signalers.</b> These interactions can involve mate choice, predation avoidance, status competition, or any other interactions that improve the likelihood that <b>signalers</b> have offspring that survive to reproduce themselves. My research collected information on 206 standing palaces built during the Florentine republic of 1282 to 1532 and during the first several decades of the succeeding Medici Duchy. My research also used primary documentary records of elections to government and guild offices, with political success used as a proxy measure for overall status. I also used electoral records as a source of demographic data. The elections records were then used to evaluate the reproductive and political success of palace builders, their families, and their contemporaries. My research found that palaces are consistent with expectations for costly signals, especially during the period of de facto Medici rule from 1434 to 1494. My research also found that palace builders had much higher than average reproductive and political success. However, they built their palaces after they had completed their reproductive lives and when they were halfway through their political careers. This timing means that palace construction did not benefit palace builders. The benefits of palace building appear instead to have been intended for the eldest sons of palace builders, who were able to maintain their fathers’ high levels of political and reproductive success. I conclude that palaces were a costly signal of families’ ability and willingness to invest resources in their inheriting sons to ensure that those sons could preserve families as demographic entities and as members of the sociopolitical elite.

40|$|Multiple {{signals that}} convey {{different}} messages {{have been reported}} in many taxa, but relatively few studies have been made on such signals in invertebrates. In the present study, I investigated four types of claw-waving display used in the fiddler crab Uca lactea to test whether the displays have different functions. Three males with a sand structure beside their burrows (which can attract females) and three males without a sand structure were fenced in an opaque enclosure, and I videotaped their waving displays after releasing two burrowless males or two burrowless females to test the effects of audiences. (a) Lateral-circular waving tended to occur in enclosures with burrowless females and was performed frequently by males that had sand structures. (b) Lateral-flick waving was performed frequently by males without sand structures, and its frequency was positively correlated with the <b>signaler’s</b> body size. (c) Rapid-vertical waving was observed frequently in enclosures with burrowless males, and its frequency was negatively correlated with the <b>signaler’s</b> body size.

In my previous study, lateral-circular waving was often seen in the breeding season and was mostly performed to female audiences, lateral-flick waving was frequently performed to neighboring resident males, rapid-vertical waving was performed mainly to intruding burrowless males, and circular waving did not have apparent audiences in most cases.

For example, in the case of primate vocal calls, <b>signalers</b> are said to produce signals unintentionally and mindlessly, whereas receivers are thought to engage in contextual interpretation to derive the significance of signals. We argue that claims about signaler-receiver asymmetries are often confused. This is partly because their authors conflate two conceptions of pragmatics, which generate different accounts of the explanatory target for accounts of the evolution of language.

The handicap principle suggests that reliable signals must be costly to the <b>signaler,</b> costing the <b>signaler</b> something {{that could not be}} afforded by an individual with less of a particular trait. For example, in the case of sexual selection, the theory suggests that animals of greater biological fitness signal this status through handicapping behaviour or morphology that effectively lowers this quality.

Receivers know that the signal indicates quality because inferior quality signallers cannot afford to produce such wastefully extravagant signals.|$|E
40|$|Animal {{communication}} signals generally evolve {{to become}} increasingly conspicuous for intended receivers [1]. However, such conspicuous signals {{are also more}} susceptible to eavesdropping, i. e. exploitation by unintended receivers [2]. It is typically thought that eavesdroppers harm <b>signalers</b> and select against conspicuous signals [3]. But, if signal conspicuousness deters eavesdroppers by indicating a cost, all receivers benefit. This may occur when eavesdroppers exploit food recruitment signals but need to fight for food access [4]. Using eusocial insects, stingless bees, we show that conspicuous signals can indicate competitive costs and enable <b>signalers</b> to escape eavesdropper-imposed costs. The dominant eavesdropper, Triogona hyalinata, avoided higher levels of Trigona spinipes pheromone that indicate a food source difficult to win, and showed attraction to lower pheromone levels that indicate a relatively undefended resource. Our decision-analysis model reveals that eavesdropping individuals that can assess takeover costs can benefit their colony by recruiting to weakly defended resources and avoiding costly takeover attempts. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|The {{signaling}} context {{has been}} found to change the meaning of the silent bared-teeth display (SBT) in pigtail macaques (Macaca nemestrina) such that the SBT in apparently peaceful contexts communicates subordination, a long-term pattern of behavior, whereas in conflict contexts it communicates immediate submission (PNAS, 104 : 1581 - 1586). However, the context dependent nature of the SBT has not yet been explored in other species. We investigated SBT usage with respect to grooming, severe aggression, and signaler-receiver sex, rank difference, and body size in seven captive groups of rhesus macaques. Peaceful SBTs were given most often to male receivers by male and female <b>signalers</b> whereas conflict SBTs were given to both male and female receivers primarily by female <b>signalers.</b> Male <b>signalers</b> rarely gave SBTs (peaceful or conflict) to female receivers. Unlike pigtail macaques, peaceful SBTs in rhesus were often accompanied by withdrawal behavior (referred to as peaceful SBT-leave), which influenced grooming, but not aggression, at the dyadic level. Severe aggression was less frequent among dyads using peaceful SBTs (regardless of withdrawal behavior) than those using conflict SBTs. In contrast, grooming was more frequent among dyads using peaceful SBT-stay signals than those using peaceful SBT-leave signals or conflict SBTs. In total, our results indicate that peaceful SBTs are a functionally different signal from conflict SBTs in rhesus macaques.
