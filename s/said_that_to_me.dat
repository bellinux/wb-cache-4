500|$|Grant often poked fun {{at himself}} with {{statements}} such as, [...] "Everyone {{wants to be}} Cary Grant—even I want to be Cary Grant", and in ad-lib lines—such as in the film His Girl Friday (1940), saying, [...] "Listen, the last man who <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> was Archie Leach, just a week before he cut his throat." [...] In Arsenic and Old Lace (1944), a gravestone is seen bearing the name Archie Leach. According to a famous story now believed to be fictional, after seeing a telegram from a magazine editor to his agent asking, [...] "How old Cary Grant?", Grant reportedly responded, [...] "Old Cary Grant fine. How you?" [...] Despite his strong comedic qualities, Alfred Hitchcock thought that Grant was also very effective in playing darker roles, with a mysterious, dangerous quality, remarking that [...] "there is a frightening side to Cary {{that no one can}} quite put their finger on". Wansell notes that this darker, mysterious side extended to his personal life, which he took great lengths to cover up to retain his debonair image.|$|E
2500|$|Talking to Der Spiegel in 2015, Cleese {{expressed}} a critical view {{on what he}} saw as a plutocracy that was unhealthily developing control of the governance of the First World's societies, stating that he had reached a point when he [...] "saw that our existence here is absolutely hopeless. I see the rich have got a stranglehold on us. If somebody had <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> when I was 20, I would have regarded him as a left-wing loony." ...|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after his}} capture, Oswald {{encountered}} reporters in a hallway. Oswald declared, [...] "I didn't shoot anybody" [...] and, [...] "They've taken me in {{because of the}} fact that I lived in the Soviet Union. I'm just a patsy!" [...] Later, at an arranged press meeting, a reporter asked, [...] "Did you kill the President?" [...] and Oswald—who by that time had been advised of the charge of murdering Tippit, but had not yet been arraigned in Kennedy's death—answered, [...] "No, I have not been charged with that. In fact, nobody has <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> yet. The first thing I heard about it was when the newspaper reporters in the hall asked me that question." [...] As he was led from the room the question was called out, [...] "What did you do in Russia?" [...] and, [...] "How did you hurt your eye?"; Oswald answered, [...] "A policeman hit me." ...|$|E

50|$|Bernie Sanders was {{disturbed}} by this. The directors {{of a company}} could actually be sued because they are responsive to their employees, to family farmers in our state and to the local economy, he <b>said.</b> <b>That</b> sounds <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be quite unacceptable.|$|R
60|$|Norah {{would not}} have <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> please <b>me</b> had she not really thought it. I could see it from that light; but it brought me no comfort. My goddess had a heart, passions, was a mere human {{creature}} like myself. From her cold throne she had stepped down to mingle with the world. So some youthful page of Arthur's court may have felt, learning the Great Queen was but a woman.|$|R
2500|$|The album's [...] "most startling" [...] {{song was}} {{considered}} [...] "What About," [...] in which Jackson violently confronts domestic abuse. Jackson stated, [...] "I think it's important to let others know that {{certain things that}} you may have experienced in your life, and that they're not alone, and that you understand what they're going through, and that they can make it through." [...] Joel Lyans included it among [...] "The New Soundtrack of Social Consciousness," [...] writing, [...] "Here, Janet does what she does best: demonstrates a coy and shy demeanor before ripping into a confident and empowered voice for those who are afraid to speak up and speak out about a situation that plagues millions of women." [...] Several media reports related its theme with President Bill Clinton's infidelity to Hillary Clinton with Monica Lewinsky. Jackson clarified it to be about her own experience, saying, [...] "President Clinton? People have <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> They say 'this is his song'," [...] comparing the situation with her song [...] "This Time" [...] inaccurately related to O.J. Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson due to its subject matter.|$|E

60|$|The reckless, shameless {{composure}} {{with which}} he <b>said</b> <b>that,</b> began <b>to</b> set <b>me</b> against him once more. The perpetual shifts and contradictions in him, bewildered and irritated me. Quicksilver itself seemed to be less slippery to lay hold of than this man.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a rummy thing," [...] he observed, [...] "but {{your father}} <b>said</b> almost exactly <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> only yesterday. Only I don't fancy {{he meant the}} same as you. To be {{absolutely}} frank, his exact expression was that he thanked God {{there was only one}} of me." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Even {{before we}} flew the X-1, I {{talked to him}} at great length about ‘what are we getting into? You know, what's it mean? We're going to be fooling around out of my realm…and you may {{understand}} this stuff but I don't. What the hell are we getting into?' And Jack would patiently explain. And I {{had a great deal}} of confidence in him and, you know, if he <b>said</b> something, <b>that,</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> was from the Bible. You could take it to the bank." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Another man <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> But he was thinkin' {{of other}} things. You are a veree ni-ice boy. I am so glad I met you.

60|$|GIRL. [Peering at him] Another man <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> But he was thinkin' of his fun. You are a veree ni-ice boy; I am so glad I met you.

6000|$|... 38. And methought they spake as if joy {{did make}} them speak; they spake with such pleasantness of Scripture language, {{and with such}} {{appearance}} of grace in all they <b>said,</b> <b>that</b> they were <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> {{as if they had}} found a new world,[18] as if they were people that dwelt alone, and were not to be reckoned among their neighbours (Num 23:9).|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, that squares with {{something}} I once heard," [...] cried Walt Baxter. [...] "I met Professor Duke {{down at the}} barn one day where he was waiting to have Nixon drive him down to town. The professor was walking around, wringing his hands and muttering to himself. He looked all out of sorts, and he <b>said</b> something <b>that</b> sounded <b>to</b> <b>me</b> like 'I don't see how I can do it! I don't see how I can really attempt it!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm so glad. I {{know you}} and I {{are going to}} get along {{together}} fine. It's such a relief to talk when one wants to and not be told that children should be seen and not heard. I've had <b>that</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> a million times if I have once. And people laugh at me because I use big words. But if you have big ideas you have to use big words to express them, haven't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> before, John, {{when the}} other one went, down at Grahamstown, and I am tired of hearing it. Don't ask me to bless the Lord when He takes my babes, no, nor any mother, He Who could spare them if He chose. Why should the Lord give me fever so that I could not nurse it, and make a snake bite the cow so that it died? If the Lord's ways are such, then those of the savages are more merciful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Clara. I cannot now let {{the matter}} pass by in that way. You {{have asked me}} whether I do not think Mr. Belton to be a gentleman, and I must say that I doubt it. Pray hear me out before you answer me. I {{do not want to}} be harder upon him than I can help; and I would have borne, and I did bear from him, a great deal in silence. But he <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> which I cannot allow to pass without notice. He had the bad taste to speak to me of his--his regard for you." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was very}} dreadful {{when they came}} to take him. I was so glad that Uncle William was not here to see it all. But it was in the morning and he had gone out to see a {{steamship}} company about being president of it, and I was tidying up our rooms, because Mrs. O'Halloran won't tidy them up any more or let the coloured servant tidy them up until we pay her more money. She <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> but I think she is afraid to say it to Uncle William. So I mean to do the work now while Uncle is out and not let him know.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no. My wife is. She'll {{be along}} directly; I {{come down here}} and drink the waters to {{encourage}} her; doctor <b>said</b> <b>to.</b> <b>That</b> gets <b>me</b> in for the diet, too. I've e't more cooked fruit since I been here than I ever did in my life before. Prunes? My Lord, I'm full o' prunes! Well, it does <b>me</b> good <b>to</b> see an American, to know him.

[...] "I've had <b>that</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> before, but I have {{my doubts}} about it," [...] remarked skeptical Anne, sniffing at her narcissi. [...] "Oh, aren't these flowers sweet! It was lovely of Mrs. Lynde {{to give them}} <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> I have no hard feelings against Mrs. Lynde now. It gives you a lovely, comfortable feeling to apologize and be forgiven, doesn't it?

6000|$|... "Mrs. Leander Crawford {{is always}} crying in church," [...] said Susan contemptuously. [...] "She cries over every {{affecting}} thing the minister says. But {{you do not}} often see her name on a subscription list, Mrs. Dr. dear. Tears come cheaper. She {{tried to talk to}} me one day about Aunt Martha being such a dirty housekeeper; and I wanted to say, 'Every one knows that YOU have been seen mixing up cakes in the kitchen wash-pan, Mrs. Leander Crawford!' But I did not say it, Mrs. Dr. dear, because I have too much respect for myself to condescend to argue with the likes of her. But I could tell worse things than THAT of Mrs. Leander Crawford, if I was disposed to gossip. And as for Mrs. Alec Davis, if she had <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> Mrs. Dr. dear, do you know what I would have said? I would have said, 'I have no doubt you would like to spank Faith, Mrs. Davis, but you will never have the chance to spank a minister's daughter either in this world or in that which is to come.'" ...|$|E
60|$|Now the Simurgh {{had given}} the prince a diamond {{weighing}} thirty misqals, and he ordered this to the king, who at once recognised its value, and asked {{where it had been}} obtained. 'I, your slave, once had riches and state and power; there are many such stones in my country. On my way here I was plundered at the Castle of Clashing Swords, and I saved this one thing only, hidden in my bathing-cloth.' In return for the diamond, King Sinaubar showered gifts of much greater value, for he remembered that it was the last possession of the prince. He showed the utmost kindness and hospitality, and gave his wazir orders to instal the prince in the royal guest-house. He took much pleasure in his visitor's society; they were together every day and spent the time most pleasantly. Several times the king said: 'Ask me for something, that I may give it you.'One day he so pressed to know what would pleasure the prince, that the latter said: 'I have only one wish, and that I will name to you in private.' The king at once commanded every one to withdraw, and then Prince Almas said: 'The desire of my life is to know what the rose did to the cypress, and what meaning there is in the words.' The king was astounded. 'In God's name! if anyone else had <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> I should have cut off his head instantly.' The prince heard this in silence, and presently so beguiled the king with pleasant talk that to kill him was impossible.|$|E

5000|$|My Global Mind said, [...] "Let’s face it, {{our present}} day relies on machines. The {{computers}} {{and cell phones}} we glare into space {{for hours on end}} are machines. Many lost the ability of social interaction, making simple meeting places such as coffee shops, music stores, and arcades, a memory of the past. Everything is turning into a controlled digital monopoly, pulling our human strings into a handful of directions that we end up having short attention spans or enter frustrated confusion. With <b>that</b> <b>said,</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> this is what Sepultura’s Machine Messiah is all about." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{choice was}} a happy one. As Yeager later explained:"Well, ... Hoover and I were {{definitely}} not flight test engineers! We could fly airplanes and we had an instinct for aerodynamics ... but Jack Ridley ... was a brain! Jack Ridley knew everything {{there was to know}} about aerodynamics and he was practical. And, besides, he was a good pilot ... and he fit right in with us. He spoke our language. Bob was a Tennessean and I was a West Virginian and, being an Okie, Jack spoke real good language for us.""Even before we flew the X-1, I talked to him at great length about ‘what are we getting into? You know, what's it mean? We're going to be fooling around out of my realm…and you may understand this stuff but I don't. What the hell are we getting into?' And Jack would patiently explain.

500|$|In {{the song}} [...] "Yonkers", Tyler, The Creator disparages {{numerous}} artists, including Bruno Mars. Tyler also disparages Mars in The Game's song [...] "Martians vs. Goblins", {{in which he}} and Lil Wayne are featured artists.

5000|$|In an August 2014, {{interview}} with MTV News, Statik Selektah said {{the album was}} inspired by a March 2010, visit to one of Kanye West's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy recording sessions in Hawaii, saying: [...] "The first beat I played him was the Nas one; Kanye sat there and listened for like 10 seconds and he pressed stop and he was like: ‘It’s cool, but jazz is dead′. I was just happy to be there, but the way he <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> always stuck in mind. This album was definitely inspired by that." ...|$|E
50|$|Cook {{expanded}} the article {{into a book}} entitled, The Unfinished Story of Alger Hiss (Morrow, 1957) and {{to the end of}} his life continued <b>to</b> maintain <b>that</b> Hiss had been innocent.

If I had made some grievous error, they would have been down on my head right away, but it didn't happen. <b>That</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> I was pretty damned accurate.
