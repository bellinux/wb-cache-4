5|$|From 28 February onwards the Spanish {{expedition}} {{was repeatedly}} approached by hostile Itzas, who sometimes shot arrows {{in the direction}} of the intruders but inflicted no casualties. At the same time, <b>small</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> curious Itzas mingled freely with the Spanish and received trinkets from them such as belts, necklaces and earrings.|$|E

5|$|<b>Small</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> {{animals with}} little {{opportunity}} for exchange between them face {{the risk of}} inbreeding, decreased genetic diversity, and even extinction. In addition, clear-cutting for firewood or agriculture, including hillside terracing, removes old trees that provide maternal dens and decreases the ability of some species of bamboo to regenerate.|$|E
5|$|The yellow-faced honeyeater {{is usually}} seen singly, in pairs, {{or in small}} family groups when not migrating. They forage as individuals, as pairs or as <b>small</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> up to ten birds, and during {{migration}} in larger groups. They sometimes feed in large mixed-species foraging flocks composed predominately of insectivorous birds.|$|E
5|$|American Patriots {{reacted to}} {{news of the}} battle with optimism. Especially after Burgoyne's Indian screen left him, <b>small</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> local Patriots began to emerge to harass the fringes of British positions. Interestingly, a {{significant}} portion of Stark's force returned home and did not again become influential in the campaign until appearing at Saratoga on October 13 to complete the encirclement of Burgoyne's army.|$|E

5|$|As Strachwitz had predicted, {{the rifle}} corps counterattacked on the {{following}} day. It was repelled by the 23rd East Prussian Grenadier Regiment which inflicted heavy casualties on the Soviets. Two <b>small</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> tanks broke through {{the lines of the}} rifle corps on 28 March in several places, splitting the bridgehead in two. Fierce air combat followed, with 41 German dive bombers shot down. The west half of the bridgehead was destroyed by 31 March, with an estimated 6,000 Soviet casualties.|$|E
5|$|During his youth, Lutosławski studied {{piano and}} {{composition}} in Warsaw. His early works {{were influenced by}} Polish folk music. His style demonstrates {{a wide range of}} rich atmospheric textures. He began developing his own characteristic composition techniques in the late 1950s. His music from this period onwards incorporates his own methods of building harmonies from <b>small</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> musical intervals. It also uses aleatoric processes, in which the rhythmic coordination of parts is subject to an element of chance.|$|E
5|$|During {{the day of}} 25 October, Puller's men {{attacked}} and eradicated the salient in their lines and hunted <b>small</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> Japanese infiltrators, killing 104 Japanese soldiers. More than 300 of Maruyama's men in total were killed in their first attacks on the Lunga perimeter. At 04:30, Hyakutake rescinded the message announcing the capture of the airfield, but at 07:00 declared {{that the results of}} Maruyama's attack were unknown.|$|E

5|$|Like other fairywrens, the {{variegated}} fairywren is {{a cooperative}} breeding species, with <b>small</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> birds maintaining and defending small territories year-round. Groups {{consist of a}} socially monogamous pair with several helper birds who assist in raising the young. Male wrens pluck yellow petals and display them to females {{as part of a}} courtship display. These birds are primarily insectivorous and forage and live in the shelter of scrubby vegetation across 90% of continental Australia, which is a wider range than that of any other fairywren.|$|E
5|$|One {{result of}} the brigades' {{scattered}} landing was that several <b>small</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> men caused havoc among the Germans, ambushing men and vehicles. One lone sergeant arrived at brigade headquarters with eighty prisoners, having convinced {{them that they were}} surrounded and should surrender. The 5th (Scottish) Parachute Battalion's 'B' Company, which had landed on the correct drop zone, ambushed a convoy of five trucks, killing twelve Germans, then assaulted a château, killing another thirty men before the surviving fifty surrendered.|$|E
5|$|Reaching {{a wartime}} {{strength}} of over 30 units and four assault brigades, the Commandos served in all theatres of war from the Arctic Circle to Europe {{and from the}} Mediterranean and Middle East to South-East Asia.

The bomber was 30 percent damaged. 6 Staffel Kampfgeschwader 30 (KG 30) lost one Junkers Ju 88 to fighters when it crashed in France and another force landed after combat. I. and II./Kampfgeschwader 51 (KG 51) lost one Ju 88 each and another damaged. In the lost Ju 88s, all crews were reported missing.|$|E
5|$|With {{the initial}} FRELIMO attacks in Chai Chai, the {{fighting}} spread to Niassa and Tete at {{the centre of}} Mozambique. During {{the early stages of}} the conflict, FRELIMO activity was reduced to small, platoon-sized engagements, harassments and raids on Portuguese installations. The FRELIMO soldiers often operated in <b>small</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> ten to fifteen soldiers. The scattered nature of FRELIMO's initial attacks was an attempt to disperse the Portuguese forces.|$|E
5|$|After Symeon's death his {{writings}} were kept alive by <b>small</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> followers, eventually {{becoming one of}} the central teachings of the hesychast movement. Many copies of his works were made in the following centuries, particularly around the 14th century, and among the Eastern Orthodox monasteries on Mt. Athos. His recognition has always been greater outside the official church, its calendar and liturgy. Historians credit this to his zealous personality, his criticism of the church hierarchy, his emphasis on direct experience of God, and some of his unorthodox teachings—including his belief that an unordained monk who had the direct experience of God was empowered to absolve others of their sins.|$|E

5|$|At {{a special}} sitting of Parliament on 28 August 1939, Rhodesia {{determined}} {{to stand by}} Great Britain {{in the event that}} war should break out, as was expected. Of a white population of just 65,000, only 10,000 were fit and available for active service. It was decided not to create a full Rhodesian formation: if it were wiped out, the colony's future prosperity would be put at risk. Instead mostly <b>small</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> Rhodesians were distributed throughout the British Army, Navy and Air Force. In the Defence Report of 1939, it was stated that forces would be trained and organised not only for internal security and defence but also to defend British interests in service outside its borders.|$|E
5|$|At night, <b>small</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> bluespotted ribbontail rays {{follow the}} rising tide onto sandy flats to root for small benthic {{invertebrates}} and bony fishes in the sediment. When the tide recedes, the rays separate and withdraw to shelters on the reef. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, with females giving birth to litters of up to seven young. This ray is capable of injuring humans with its venomous tail spines, though it prefers to flee if threatened. Because of its beauty and size, the bluespotted ribbontail ray is popular with private aquarists despite being poorly suited to captivity. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Near Threatened, as it faces widespread habitat degradation and intensive fishing pressure throughout its range.|$|E
5|$|By {{this stage}} of the insurgency, the MNLA had largely split into <b>small</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> guerrillas, which existed by basing {{themselves}} in a chosen rural area, subverting local villagers and accumulating from them manpower and supplies. The lot of any security forces posted nearby was to play a constant game of hide-and-seek with the communists, whereby the army would indefinitely search for and destroy any base camps and food caches the MNLA set up. The Commonwealth leaders surmised that the MNLA could not possibly resist such a campaign forever, and would, in time, simply give up attempting to regroup.|$|E
