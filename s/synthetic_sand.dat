40|$|AbstractThe {{heterogeneous}} {{nature of}} typical sedimentary formations {{can play a}} major role in the propagation of the CO 2 plume, eventually dampening the accumulation of mobile phase underneath the caprock. From core flooding experiments, it is also known that contrasts in capillary threshold pressure due to different pore size can affect the flow paths of the invading and displaced fluids and consequently influence the build- up of non-wetting phase (NWP) at interfaces between geological facies. The full characterization of the geologic variability at all relevant scales and the ability to make observations on the spatial and temporal distribution of the migration and trapping of supercritical CO 2 is not feasible from a practical perspective. To provide insight into the impact of well-defined heterogeneous systems on the flow dynamics and trapping efficiency of supercritical CO 2 under drainage and imbibition conditions, we present an experimental investigation at the meter scale conducted in <b>synthetic</b> <b>sand</b> reservoirs packed in a quasi-two-dimensional flow-cell. Two immiscible displacement experiments have been performed to observe the preferential entrapment of NWP in simple heterogeneous porous media. The experiments consisted of an injection, a fluid redistribution, and a forced imbibition stages conducted in an uncorrelated permeability field and a homogeneous base case scenario. We adopted x-ray attenuation analysis as a non-destructive technique that allows a precise measurement of phase saturations throughout the entire flow domain. By comparing a homogeneous and a heterogeneous scenario we have identified some important effects that can be attributed to capillary barriers, such as dampened plume advancement, higher non-wetting phase saturations, larger contact area between the injected and displaced phases, and a larger range of non-wetting phase saturations...|$|E
40|$|Turbine (rotor) mixers {{are widely}} used in {{foundries}} for bentonite rebonding of synthetic system sands. They form basic equipment in modern sand processing plants. Their major advantage is the short time of the rebond mixing cycle. Until now, no complete theoretical description {{of the process of}} mixing in turbine mixers has been offered. Neither does it seem reasonable to try to adapt the theoretical backgrounds of the mixing process carried out in mixers of other types, for example, rooler mixers [1], to the description of operation of the turbine mixers. Truly one can risk the statement that the individual fundamental operations of mixing in rooler mixers, like kneading, grinding, mixing and thinning, are also performed in turbine mixers. Yet, even if so, in turbine mixers these processes are proceeding at a rate and intensity different than in the roller mixers. The fact should also be recalled that the theoretical backgrounds usually relate to the preparation of sand mixtures from new components, and this considerably restricts the field of application of these descriptions when referred to rebond mixing of the system sand.

40|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (MRI) are well established techniques. Both require samples to be placed inside spatially-homogeneous static magnetic and radio frequency magnetic fields. This research focuses on applying the principles of NMR spectroscopy and imaging to design a system that can produce images of the NMR signal from a sample placed adjacent to it. The long term goal is to image at distances of meters from the device. The specific application of interest is locating buried utilities in fully-hydrated soils by identifying non-signal bearing features in an NMR signal rich background. This thesis asserts that {{a minimum of three}} questions need to be answered to determine if near surface MRI is feasible. 1.) Can the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s magnetic field (BEarth) be used as the applied static magnetic field? 2.) Is the NMR signal from the water found in fully-hydrated soils sufficient for imaging? 3.) Can a near-surface imaging technique be developed? This thesis research attempts to answer each of these questions in three stand alone investigations: 1.) In situ measurements of BEarth, 2.) laboratory-based relaxation studies of <b>synthetic</b> <b>sands,</b> and 3.) the development of a proof-of-concept near-surface {{magnetic resonance imaging}} device. It is the assertion of this thesis that the results of these three studies are needed to begin to properly understand the signal space that a viable surface instrument would have to operate within for practical use.

40|$|AbstractThe dynamic {{deformation}} of both edge clamped stainless steel sandwich panels with a pyramidal truss core and equal mass monolithic plates loaded by spherically expanding shells of dry and water saturated sand has been investigated, both experimentally and via a particle based simulation methodology. The spherically expanding sand shell {{is generated by}} detonating a sphere of explosive surrounded by a shell of either dry or water saturated <b>synthetic</b> <b>sand.</b> The measurements show that the sandwich panel and plate deflections decrease with increasing stand-off between {{the center of the}} charge and the front of the test structures. Moreover, for the same charge and sand mass, the deflections of the plates are significantly higher in the water saturated sand case compared to that of dry sand. For a given stand-off, the mid-span deflection of the sandwich panel rear faces was substantially less than that of the corresponding monolithic plate for both the dry and water saturated sand cases. The experiments were simulated via a coupled discrete-particle/finite element scheme wherein the high velocity impacting sand is modeled by interacting particles while the plate is modeled within a Lagrangian finite element setting. The simulations are in good agreement with the measurements for the dry sand impact of both the monolithic and sandwich structures. However, the simulations underestimate the effect of stand-off {{in the case of the}} water saturated sand explosion, i. e. the deflections decrease more sharply with increasing stand-off in the experiments compared to the simulations. The simulations reveal that the momentum transmitted into the sandwich and monolithic plate structures by the sand shell is approximately the same, consistent with a small fluid–structure interaction effect. The smaller deflection of the sandwich panels is therefore primarily due to the higher bending strength of sandwich structures...|$|E

With no effective vaccine and culling of infected dogs an unpopular and unsuccessful alternative, new tools are urgently needed to manage populations of the sand fly vector, Lutzomyia longipalpis Lutz and Neiva (Diptera: Psychodidae). Here, we test two potential {{strategies for}} improving L. longipalpis control using the <b>synthetic</b> <b>sand</b> fly pheromone (±) - 9 -methylgermacrene-B: the first in conjunction with spraying of animal houses with insecticide, the second using coloured sticky traps. Results Addition of synthetic pheromone resulted in greater numbers of male and female sand flies being caught and killed at experimental chicken sheds sprayed with insecticide, compared to pheromone-less controls. Furthermore, a ten-fold increase in the amount of sex pheromone released from test sheds increased the number of females attracted and subsequently killed. Treating sheds with insecticide alone resulted in a significant decrease in numbers of males attracted to sheds (compared to pre-spraying levels), and a near significant decrease in numbers of females. However, this effect was reversed through addition of synthetic pheromone at the time of insecticide spraying, leading to an increase in number of flies attracted post-treatment. In field trials of commercially available different coloured sticky traps, yellow traps caught more males than blue traps when placed in chicken sheds. In addition, yellow traps fitted with 10 pheromone lures caught significantly more males than pheromone-less controls. However, while female sand flies showed a preference for both blue and yellow pheromone traps sticky traps over white traps in the laboratory, neither colour caught significant numbers of females in chicken sheds, either with or without pheromone. Conclusions We conclude that synthetic pheromone could currently be most effectively deployed for sand fly control through combination with existing insecticide spraying regimes. Development of a standalone pheromone trap remains a possibility, but such devices may require an additional attractive host odour component to be fully effective. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is {{to better understand the}} transport and seismoelectric (SE) properties of porous permeable rock. Accurate information of rock transport properties, together with pore geometry, can aid us to better quantify the frequency dependence of its SE coupling coefficient. With the development of micro-CT (pCT) scanners, microstructure of the sedimentary rock can now be obtained in three dimensions at micron level resolution. Pore scale modeling on the rock 3 -D pCT images provides us the ability to obtain different rock properties all at once and without much ambiguity. In this thesis, we build numerical tools to compute a range of transport properties and pore geometry parameters (e. g., porosity, electrical conductivity, hydraulic permeability, pore surface area) on the microstructures from basic physical laws. A staggered-grid finite difference (FD) scheme is used to solve the Laplace equation for electrical conductivity and the Stokes equation for hydraulic conductivity. The Laplace solver can handle different levels of conductivity contrast so that different saturations (gas, oil and brine) can be modeled. A three-phase conductivity model developed on the binary representation of the microstructure, which is based on the geometric average of free electrolyte conductance and surface conductance in the EDL, is illustrated. Two different edge detection methods are applied to recognize surface voxel in a binary image. One is a gradient based, first order differential method and the second one is a connectivity-number-based edge detection (CNED) method. Computations are done for a family of <b>synthetic</b> <b>sand</b> packs - Finney pack with low, medium to high porosities - to provide a benchmark of numerical tools and to compare with analytic solutions. Then, the numerical methods are used to calculate properties of Berea Sandstone 500 (BS 500) with 23. 6 % porosity, whose 3 -D microtomograms with 2. 8 micron resolution are available. Using the numerical methods, rock porosity, pore surface area, (cont.) electrical conductivity and permeability are calculated. These are compared with the laboratory measurements made on the same rock. The numerical and laboratory values compare very well. Impact of various aspects of numerical modeling on the accuracy of results are evaluated. It is demonstrated that increasing the sample used in the computation improves the match between the numerical values and laboratory measurements. Reducing the spatial resolution (i. e. increasing grid size), most affects the accuracy of electrical conductivity and hydraulic permeability. Seismoelectric measurements are carried out at 10 kHz - 120 kHz range for the BS 500 sample. Both single sine pulse and five-cycle sine burst are adopted as acoustic source wavelets. Streaming potential is collected on freshly cut BS 500 cylinder core samples saturated with different brine conductivities under the same experimental condition as the AC measurements. With the transport and geometrical parameters previously obtained from ptCT image and laboratory measurements, the frequency dependent coupling coefficient of BS 500 is theoretically calculated using available rock properties. Comparison between the theoretical prediction and the experimental data is found to be promising. This experiment extends our ability to conduct quantitative seismoelectric measurements at frequency ranges applied for field and laboratory acoustic borehole logging. by Xin Zhan. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Previous work using NMR to investigate heavy oil and bitumen sands has primarily focused on one-dimensional relaxation analysis. Whilst the spectra produced are sensitive to the confining geometry and fluid types, there is often overlap between relaxation peaks from different fluids with similar relaxation times.

Through software simulation, {{the parameters of the}} riser, such as number, size and position, were rationally designed to effectively avoid the casting defects, e.g. cracks and loose. To overcome the problem of blowholes in casting, in terms of process, a vent was made on the core and on the sand box. In addition, a well-shaped exhaust duct was made on the sand box. Large particles of <b>synthetic</b> quartz <b>sand</b> were used as the back sand. In these ways, the casting blowhole was effectively eliminated. In addition, the measures of a one-box multi-core combined tool and a core with multiple positioning were applied to ensure dimensional accuracy. In the machining process, the benchmark superposition method was used to achieve location accuracy. Before semi-finishing machining, a baseline was mapped properly, and the base surface was machined properly. Based on the correct baseline, the surface of each hole was machined in semi-finishing or finishing. To meet the requirements of geometric tolerances of some holes, a one clamping multichannel processing method was used to ensure the requirements of finishing size. A “casting-air quenching and high temperature tempering-rough-finishing-stress removal tempering-finishing” processing route was used to ensure the strength and dimensional stability of the castings.

40|$|Dielectric {{logging tools}} {{have been used}} for some time in {{attempting}} to characterize oil reservoirs, and in particular to provide in-situ measurements of oil and water saturation. The particular sensitivity of basic electrical measurements, e. g. resistivity, to the presence of water made the original use of this approach most relevant to the determination of water-filled porosity. In-depth dielectric spectroscopic analyses reveal contributions from underlying processes in materials, including electronic, ionic (electric double layer, EDL) and interfacial (Maxwell-Wagner, M-W) polarization, as well as molecular orientation. Our particular objective is the evaluation of dielectric spectroscopy as a means of characterizing the physico-chemical and structural characteristics of oil sands. Relatively recently, there has been a resurgence in interest in the application of dielectric techniques to unconsolidated heterogeneous systems. The present study builds on recent developments in the literature, and, specifically {{to determine the extent to}} which the potentially dominant effects of water can be overcome in order to access additional information, such as particle size and wettability. This initial study has therefore involved investigating a range of <b>synthetic</b> oil <b>sands</b> systematically prepared from bitumen, water, sand and clay, to compare the behaviour with results obtained from a real core sample (obtained from a BP asset). The low-frequency dielectric spectroscopic analysis (10 to 10 Hz) yields complex properties (e. g. conductivity, permittivity, impedance) with frequency dependent in-phase and quadrature components. Within this frequency range, dielectric spectra are dominated by EDL and M-W polarization effects. By varying the sample preparation methods, it has been possible to observe structural differences with respect to water. Copyright 2013, Society of Petroleum Engineers...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{availability}} of industrial alkalinity sources is investigated {{to determine their}} potential for the simultaneous capture and sequestration of CO 2 from point-source emissions in the United States. Industrial alkalinity sources investigated include fly ash, cement kiln dust, and iron and steel slag. Their feasibility for mineral carbonation is determined by their relative abundance for CO 2 reactivity and their proximity to point-source CO 2 emissions. In addition, the available aggregate markets are investigated as possible sinks for mineral carbonation products. We show that in the U. S., industrial alkaline byproducts {{have the potential to}} mitigate approximately 7. 6 Mt CO 2 /yr, of which 7. 0 Mt CO 2 /yr are CO 2 captured through mineral carbonation and 0. 6 Mt CO 2 /yr are CO 2 emissions avoided through reuse as <b>synthetic</b> aggregate (replacing <b>sand</b> and gravel). The emission reductions represent a small share (i. e., 0. 1 %) of total U. S. CO 2 emissions; however, industrial byproducts may represent comparatively low-cost methods for the advancement of mineral carbonation technologies, which may be extended to mor...|$|R
40|$|High {{crude oil}} prices and the {{eventual}} decline of conventional oil production {{raise the issue of}} alternative fuels such as non- conventional oil. The paper describes a simple probabilistic model of the costs of synthetic crude oil (SCO) produced from Canadian oil <b>sands.</b> <b>Synthetic</b> crude oil is obtained by upgrading bitumen that is first produced through mining or in-situ recovery techniques. This forward looking analysis quantifies the effects of learning and production constraints on the costs of supplying synthetic crude oil from Canadian bitumen deposits. The results show the uncertainties associated with the future costs of synthetic crude oil. Carbon costs have a large impact of the total costs of synthetic crude oil, in particular in the case of synthetic crude oil from in-situ bitumen, due to the carbon intensity of the recovery techniques. The influence of each parameter on the supply costs is examined. In the case of mined SCO, the maximum production rate, the ultimate recovery rate and the depletion parameters show the largest influence on the results, while learning parameters dominate in the case of in-situ SCO...|$|R
40|$|A better {{understanding}} of seismic wave attenuation in hydrate-bearing sediments is needed for the improved geophysical quantification of seafloor methane hydrates, important for climate change, geohazard and economic resource assessment. Hence, we {{conducted a series of}} small strain (< 10 ? 6), seismic frequency (50 – 550 Hz), laboratory resonant column experiments on <b>synthetic</b> methane hydrate-bearing <b>sands</b> under excess-water seafloor conditions. The results show a complex dependence of P- and S-wave attenuation on hydrate saturation and morphology. P- and S-wave attenuation in excess-water hydrate-bearing sand is much higher than in excess-gas hydrate-bearing sand and increases with hydrate saturation between 0 and 0. 44 (the experimental range). Theoretical modelling suggests that load-bearing hydrate is an important cause of heightened attenuation for both P- and S-waves in gas and water saturated sands, while pore-filling hydrate also contributes significantly to P-wave attenuation in water saturated sands. A squirt flow attenuation mechanism, related to microporous hydrate and low aspect ratio pores at the interface between sand grains and hydrate, is thought to be responsible for the heightened levels of attenuation in hydrate-bearing sands at low hydrate saturations (< 0. 44) ...|$|R
40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} or 3 D printing, manufacturing {{a product}} layer by layer, offers large design freedom and faster product development cycles, {{as well as}} low startup cost of production, on-demand production and local production. In principle, any product could be made by additive manufacturing. Even food and living organic cells can be printed. We can create, design and manufacture what we want at the location we want. 3 D printing will create a revolution in manufacturing, a real paradigm change. 3 D printing holds the promise to manufacture with less waste and energy. We can print metals, ceramics, <b>sand,</b> <b>synthetic</b> materials such as plastics, food or living cells. However, the production of plastics is nowadays based on fossil fuels. And that’s where we witness a paradigm change too. The production of these synthetic materials can be based also on biomaterials with biomass as feedstock. A wealth of new and innovative products are emerging when we combine these two paradigm changes: 3 D printing and biomaterials. Moreover, the combination of 3 D printing with biomaterials holds the promise to realize a truly sustainable and circular economy. ...|$|R
