50|$|In {{order to}} create {{accurate}} master-slave manipulator devices, {{it was necessary for}} Goertz to develop several principles, all of which are applicable to our own contemporary robotic surgical systems. The principles are as follows. The motion of the <b>slave</b> <b>arm</b> must possess six independent degrees of freedom, three of translation and three of rotation to position gripping devices, and a tong squeeze motion to grip items. The motion of the <b>slave</b> <b>arm</b> must be coupled to the master arms that the position and the direction of the two arms correspond to. The coupling of the two arms must be bilateral and this means that forces at the slave end must be reflected at the master end and displacements produced at the slave end must be able to produce a displacement at the master end, with the <b>slave</b> <b>arm</b> being able to align itself in response to the constraints imposed by the task being done.|$|E
5000|$|The {{goal of a}} {{master-slave}} manipulator is the protection of workers from radiation while enabling precise manipulation of materials. The machine {{can be thought of}} as two distinct devices, the [...] "slave" [...] and [...] "master" [...] arms. The [...] "slave" [...] arm is responsive to the controlling device, the [...] "master" [...] arm, with the benefit that through remote handling manual tasks can be performed without the need of direct human intervention. In nuclear settings the <b>slave</b> <b>arm</b> is located within a hot-cell and the master arm is located in a control room. Whenever the master arm is manipulated, the motion is reproduced precisely by the <b>slave</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|E

5000|$|An Arm Slave is {{operated}} in a semi-master-slave system.

30|$|Because the {{position}} of the virtual arm was sent to the <b>slave</b> <b>arm,</b> and it was used in the <b>slave</b> <b>arm</b> control (the third term of the right hand side of 2), the motion of the virtual arm almost corresponds to the motion of the <b>slave</b> <b>arm</b> (note that the time delay was zero in HILS 1).|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{introduce}} a position-exchange controller for bilateral teleoperation of flexible surgical robots. The controller requires {{the position of}} the master arm and the deformed shape of the <b>slave</b> <b>arm,</b> but no force information is required. The position-tracking controller of the master arm causes the master arm to follow {{the position of the}} tip of the <b>slave</b> <b>arm.</b> The position tracking controller of the <b>slave</b> <b>arm</b> causes the slave to follow the position of the master and also deforms the shape of the <b>slave</b> <b>arm</b> until the force generated at its tip matches the force applied to the master. The position exchange controller is illustrated using two systems. The first is a simple one degree of freedom flexible robot. The second system is a surgical robot constructed from a set of precurved superelastic concentric tubes. The control structure enables fast computation of the deformed shape kinematics of the <b>slave</b> <b>arm</b> using Cosserat rod theory. Simulation results show that the controller provides transparency at the low frequencies necessary for palpation of soft tissue. I...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a joint-space adaptive control scheme for controlling the <b>slave</b> <b>arm</b> motion of a dual-arm telerobot system developed at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) to study telerobotic operations in space. Each <b>slave</b> <b>arm</b> of the dual-arm system is a kinematically redundant manipulator with seven degrees of freedom (DOF). Using the concept of model reference adaptive control (MRAC) and Liupunov direct method, we derive an adaptation algorithm that adjusts the PD controller gains of the control scheme. The development of the adaptive control scheme assumes that the <b>slave</b> <b>arm</b> motion is non-compliant and slowly varying. The implementation of the derived control scheme does not require the computation of manipulator dynamics which makes the control scheme sufficiently fast for real-time applications. Computer simulation study performed for the 7 -DOF <b>slave</b> <b>arm</b> shows that the developed control scheme can efficiently adapt to sudden change in payload while tracking various test trajectories such as ramp or sinusoids with negligible position errors...|$|E

40|$|This work {{concerns}} {{the design and}} development of a {{six degrees of freedom}} haptic device. The haptic device is used as the master arm for internet-based teleoperation purposes. For the experimentation, the Stewarl platform, the other parallel mechanism, is used as the <b>slave</b> <b>arm</b> ^ The force reflex from the <b>slave</b> <b>arm</b> is transmitted to the operator through the Tendon-Pulley train of the master arm. Virlual guidance can be implemented in the master arm to improve the maneuverability for the operators. Low ineftia, friction force, and backlash are minimized in the design. Singularity is also eliminated. The inverse and forward kinematics as well as the Jacobian of the master arm are derived. The closed-form solution of the forward kinematics can be obtained by installing 9 encoders, instead of 6. The end-point of the master arm is sent to the slave arrn as commands. The <b>slave</b> <b>arm</b> transforms the commands to joint variables by using the inverse kinematics of the <b>slave</b> <b>arm.</b> The experimental results show that the haptic device is capable of controlling the Stewarl platform and can be used for other parallel mechanisms as well...|$|E
30|$|The {{concept of}} a space robot {{teleoperation}} system is illustrated in Fig.  1. In the space center on earth, an operator manipulates the master arms {{by looking at the}} virtual environment and predicting the movement of the space robot on orbit. The control inputs from the master arms and the position data of the virtual arm are transferred to the <b>slave</b> <b>arm</b> on orbit with a communication delay. The slave arms on orbit follow the motion commands generated by the master arms on earth. When the slave arms contact with the payload or the environment, the contact force is locally controlled using force sensor data. However, the slave arms’ position data arrive at the space center on earth with a communication delay. Hence, the positions of the slave arms at the moment of teleoperation are unknown on earth. In order to overcome the communication delay problem, simulated motions of the slave arms (virtual arms) are displayed for the human operator. The simulated motion is transferred to the <b>slave</b> <b>arm</b> controller as well as the motion command generated by the master arms (see Fig.  1). The motion of the virtual arms modifies the slave arm’s position in order to eliminate the error between the <b>slave</b> <b>arm</b> and virtual arm. The joint angle data of the <b>slave</b> <b>arm</b> are transferred to the virtual environment in order to display the movement of the <b>slave</b> <b>arm,</b> which is superimposed on the movement of the virtual arm. The system can be divided into the hybrid motion simulator, the slave system, and the master system.|$|E

[...] It was thought that MITHRIL was the only organization operating Third Generation <b>Arm</b> <b>Slaves</b> in combat by its Response Teams.

30|$|First, {{a virtual}} massive payload of 4500 kg was grasped by the <b>slave</b> <b>arm</b> and was {{transferred}} along the x-axis {{at a constant}} speed of 0.01 m/s for 20 s (HILS 1). Next, a virtual massive payload of 4500 kg was grasped by the <b>slave</b> <b>arm</b> and was transferred along the x-axis by human teleoperation with a communication delay of 5 s (HILS 2) (see Additional file 1). In the teleoperation experiment, the input values for the y and z axes components {{are assumed to be}} zero.|$|E
30|$|Another HIL {{simulation}} {{was performed}} to verify {{the effectiveness of the}} force feedback in (2) in reducing the resultant force during the massive-payload manipulation mission. When a virtual payload of 3000 kg is manipulated in a HIL simulation without force feedback, a huge force will be generated between the payload and the end effector of the <b>slave</b> <b>arm,</b> and hence there is a risk that the <b>slave</b> <b>arm</b> used in this research will be broken. Therefore, in this HIL simulation, a massive payload of 500 kg is used instead of 3000 kg.|$|E

30|$|This work uses model-based teleoperation [6, 7], {{but it is}} {{modified}} to apply to massive payload manipulation. The main modification pertains to the scaling between the master arm and the <b>slave</b> <b>arm.</b> The original model-based teleoperation using mixed force and motion commands [6, 7] assumed that the force and motion in both arms (master and slave arms) were of the same scale. However, in massive-payload manipulation, the force/motion command given by a human operator should be scaled up so that the large-sized <b>slave</b> <b>arm</b> can manipulate the massive payload. In the following sections, modified model-based teleoperation using mixed force and motion commands is presented.|$|E

The ability to decouple the hand controller impedance from the <b>slave</b> <b>arm</b> dynamics is expected to be even more significant when the inertial properties of various payloads in the <b>slave</b> <b>arm</b> are considered...|$|E
