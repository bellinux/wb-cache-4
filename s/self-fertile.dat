5|$|Almost {{all species}} are hermaphrodites, {{in other words}} each {{individual}} can function as both male and female. Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites, which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time, while others are sequential hermaphrodites, in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times. The gonads {{are located in the}} parts of the internal canal network under the comb rows, and eggs and sperm are released via pores in the epidermis. Fertilization is generally external, but platyctenids use internal fertilization and keep the eggs in brood chambers until they hatch. Self-fertilization has occasionally been seen in species of the genus Mnemiopsis, and it is thought that most of the hermaphroditic species are <b>self-fertile.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{flowers are}} <b>self-fertile,</b> but are pollinated by insects.|$|E
25|$|While Eastern White Pine is <b>self-fertile,</b> seeds {{produced}} this way tend {{to result in}} weak, stunted, and malformed seedlings.|$|E
25|$|Common {{rootstocks}} include Mazzard, Mahaleb, Colt, and Gisela Series, a {{dwarfing rootstock}} that produces trees significantly smaller than others, only 8 to 10 feet (2.5 to 3 meters) tall. Sour cherries require no pollenizer, while few sweet varieties are <b>self-fertile.</b>|$|E
25|$|Only {{a handful}} of olive {{varieties}} {{can be used to}} cross-pollinate. 'Pendolino' olive trees are partially <b>self-fertile,</b> but pollenizers are needed for a large fruit crop. Other compatible olive tree pollenizers include 'Leccino' and 'Maurino'. 'Pendolino' olive trees are used extensively as pollenizers in large olive tree groves.|$|E
25|$|Peaches are {{considered}} <b>self-fertile</b> because a commercial crop {{can be produced}} without cross-pollination, though cross-pollination usually gives a better crop. Apples {{are considered}} self-incompatible, because a commercial crop must be cross-pollinated. Many commercial fruit tree varieties are grafted clones, genetically identical. An orchard block of apples of one variety is genetically a single plant. Many growers now consider this a mistake. One means of correcting this mistake is to graft a limb of an appropriate pollenizer (generally a variety of crabapple) every six trees or so.|$|E
500|$|In North America, {{there is}} a need for this fruit to have {{resistance}} to white pine blister rust. New cultivars such as 'Crusader', 'Coronet' and 'Consort' have been developed there by crossing R. nigrum with R. ussuriense and these show resistance to the disease. However the quality and yield of these varieties are poor as compared to non-resistant strains and only Consort is reliably <b>self-fertile.</b> Back-crossing these varieties to a parent have produced new strains such as 'Titania' that have a higher yield, better disease resistance, are more tolerant of adverse weather conditions and are suitable for machine harvesting. [...] Two new releases from a black currant breeding program in British Columbia, Canada, 'Blackcomb' and 'Tahsis', were selected for their immunity to white pine blister rust and their frost tolerance.|$|E
2500|$|Pollination also {{requires}} consideration of pollenizers. The terms [...] "pollinator" [...] and [...] "pollenizer" [...] are often confused: a pollinator is the agent that moves the pollen, {{whether it be}} bees, flies, bats, moths, or birds; a pollenizer is the plant {{that serves as the}} pollen source for other plants. Some plants are self-compatible [...] (<b>self-fertile)</b> and can pollinate and fertilize themselves. Other plants have chemical or physical barriers to self-pollination.|$|E
2500|$|Flowering is {{triggered}} by day length, often beginning once days become shorter than 12.8 hours. This trait is highly variable however, with different varieties reacting differently to changing day length. Soybeans form inconspicuous, <b>self-fertile</b> flowers which are borne in the axil {{of the leaf}} and are white, pink or purple. Depending of the soybean variety, node growth may cease once flowering begins. Strains that continue nodal development after flowering are termed [...] "indeterminates" [...] and are best suited to climates with longer growing seasons. Often soybeans drop their leaves before the seeds are fully mature.|$|E
2500|$|Flowers in this genus {{are born}} singly {{at the end}} of unbranching, leaf-like inflorescences which emerge from the leaf axes. The five-petaled flowers are {{generally}} purple to pale violet, though B. gigantea und B. filifolia can sometimes produce white flowers. Except for the <b>self-fertile</b> B. liniflora, all species require pollen from other individuals for fertilization. The pollen release of B. gigantea and B. lamellata is only triggered by the resonance frequency of a landing pollinator, helping ensure cross-pollination with other individuals. [...] The flowers of Byblis start to bloom in early spring and last until late summer.|$|E
2500|$|Self-pollination {{occurs when}} pollen from one flower pollinates the same flower or other flowers {{of the same}} individual. [...] It {{is thought to have}} evolved under {{conditions}} when pollinators were not reliable vectors for pollen transport, and is most often seen in short-lived annual species and plants that colonize new locations. Self-pollination may include autogamy, where pollen is transferred to the female part of the same flower; or geitonogamy, when pollen is transferred to another flower on the same plant. Plants adapted to self-fertilize often have similar stamen and carpel lengths. Plants that can pollinate themselves and produce viable offspring are called <b>self-fertile.</b> Plants that cannot fertilize themselves are called self-sterile, a condition which mandates cross-pollination for the production of offspring.|$|E
2500|$|Cleistogamy: is {{self-pollination}} {{that occurs}} before the flower opens. [...] The pollen is {{released from the}} anther within the flower or the pollen on the anther grows a tube down the style to the ovules. It {{is a type of}} sexual breeding, in contrast to asexual systems such as apomixis. [...] Some cleistogamous flowers never open, in contrast to chasmogamous flowers that open and are then pollinated. Cleistogamous flowers are by necessity found on self-compatible or <b>self-fertile</b> plants. Although certain orchids and grasses are entirely cleistogamous, other plants resort to this strategy under adverse conditions. Often there may be a mixture of both cleistogamous and chasmogamous flowers, sometimes on different parts of the plant and sometimes in mixed inflorescences. The ground bean produces cleistogamous flowers below ground, and mixed cleistogamous and chasmogamous flowers above.|$|E
