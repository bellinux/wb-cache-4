5|$|Thirty-seven {{people were}} killed during the storm and its aftermath. Most of them were killed in motor vehicle accidents, {{including}} one in Ontario, three in Nebraska, two in New York, two in Illinois, two in New Jersey, two in Indiana, two in Delaware, one in New Brunswick, five in Quebec, one in Louisiana, one in New Hampshire, six in Vermont, one in Missouri, one in Pennsylvania, one in Virginia, and six in Ohio. In addition to traffic accidents, fatalities were reported due to tornadoes, heart attacks while shoveling, roof collapses due to heavy snow, falling tree branches and carbon monoxide poisoning. In Quebec City, a 16-year-old boy disappeared during the snowstorm and was found dead three days later in a <b>snow</b> <b>bank.</b>|$|E
5|$|Initial {{results were}} {{surprising}} as the material excavated {{by the impact}} contained more dust and less ice than had been expected. The only models of cometary structure astronomers could positively rule out were the very porous ones which had comets as loose aggregates of material. In addition, the material was finer than expected; scientists compared it to talcum powder rather than sand. Other materials found while studying the impact included clays, carbonates, sodium, and crystalline silicates which were found by studying the spectroscopy of the impact. Clays and carbonates usually require liquid water to form and sodium is rare in space. Observations also revealed that the comet was about 75% empty space, and one astronomer compared the outer layers of the comet to the same makeup of a <b>snow</b> <b>bank.</b> Astronomers have expressed interest in more missions to different comets {{to determine if they}} share similar compositions or if there are different materials found deeper within comets that were produced {{at the time of the}} Solar System's formation.|$|E
25|$|On 13 March 1987, a {{chartered}} Beechcraft King Air (LN-PAG) {{with six}} passengers crashed during landing at Stord Airport, Sørstokken, 20 metres {{ahead of the}} runway. The aircraft skidded for about 100 metres before coming to rest in a <b>snow</b> <b>bank.</b> There were no injuries.|$|E
30|$|Intermediate uveitis is {{generally}} {{believed to be}} autoimmune in nature, and <b>snow</b> <b>banking</b> is an important clinical sign of intermediate uveitis[1 – 3]. In tuberculosis-endemic countries like India, tuberculosis is an important etiologic cause of intermediate uveitis[5]. <b>Snow</b> <b>banking</b> {{is generally}} described in intermediate uveitis due to autoimmune etiology {{and has not been}} described frequently in tubercular uveitis. This case report highlights the rare finding of <b>snow</b> <b>banking</b> in tubercular uveitis. It is important to investigate intermediate uveitis for tuberculosis even if <b>snow</b> <b>banking</b> is seen as specific antitubercular therapy helps in reducing the recurrences significantly.|$|R
30|$|<b>Snow</b> <b>banking</b> {{is usually}} a term coined to {{describe}} the accumulation of white or cream vitreous exudates over the pars plana and the peripheral retina in pars planitis. It has also been described in intermediate uveitis due to Lyme disease, sarcoidosis, and multiple sclerosis[1 – 3]. <b>Snow</b> <b>banking</b> is very rare in tubercular intermediate uveitis. In this case report, we report an interesting finding of <b>snow</b> <b>banking</b> in tubercular intermediate uveitis and the response to antitubercular therapy (ATT).|$|R
30|$|<b>Snow</b> <b>banking</b> {{is usually}} a term coined to {{describe}} the accumulation of vitreous exudates over the pars plana and the peripheral retina in pars planitis. <b>Snow</b> <b>banking</b> is very rare in tubercular intermediate uveitis. A 32 -year-old male was diagnosed to have intermediate uveitis due to tubercular etiology in the right eye. Laboratory investigations include an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, positive Mantoux test, and computed tomography thorax showing mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Transbronchial needle aspiration of the lymph nodes showed chronic granulomatous inflammation with caseation. There were no recurrences following antitubercular therapy (ATT). This case report highlights the unique finding of <b>snow</b> <b>banking</b> in tubercular uveitis and course following treatment with ATT.|$|R
500|$|With a seating {{capacity}} of 29,000, Bislett Stadium became the centrepiece of the Games. It was the venue for the speed skating {{events and the}} figure skating competition. Bislett was large enough for a [...] speed skating track, and a figure skating ice-rink of a <b>snow</b> <b>bank</b> separated the track and the rink. Because Bislett was an outdoor arena, the organizing committee chose Tryvann Stadion and Hamar Stadion as secondary alternative skating venues to be used the case of bad weather. In 1994 Hamar became the venue for the speed skating events at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer.|$|E
500|$|The 1983 season {{started the}} Group B {{era of the}} WRC and Mouton was now {{at the wheel of}} the Audi Quattro A1. She also had a new teammate; Audi had signed Stig Blomqvist as their third regular driver. For the third year in a row, Mouton had a bad start to her season in Monte Carlo. She went off the road on a stage not far from her home town, and again hit a stone wall at over 100km/h (60mph). The car was destroyed, but Mouton and Pons were unharmed. Mouton {{explained}} to her team boss Roland Gumpert, later of Gumpert supercar fame, that she had had to dodge a photographer. Mouton went on to record successive points finishes. She finished fourth in Sweden in a quadruple win for Audi, after an early driving error that had sent her Quattro into a <b>snow</b> <b>bank.</b> In Portugal, Mouton finished second to Mikkola, ahead of Lancia's Röhrl and Markku Alén. After the first section of the Safari Rally, totaling over 1,600km (1,000mi), Mouton arrived to the finish on three wheels and said she was [...] "totally exhausted" [...] from the effort. She eventually placed third behind Opel's Ari Vatanen and her teammate Mikkola. After four events, Mikkola and Mouton were first and second in the drivers' championship.|$|E
500|$|Mouton's 1982 season {{started with}} a big {{accident}} at the Monte Carlo Rally. On stage twelve {{in the small town}} Briançonnet in Provence, she missed a patch of ice and slid off the road, crashing into the stone wall of a large house at 110km/h (70mph). Mouton injured her knee while Pons suffered a concussion. She had been in third place, and had set the fastest time for the difficult Col de Turini mountain pass. The pair's injuries were not serious and Mouton went on to make her debut in the Swedish Rally. She was running third when she slid into a <b>snow</b> <b>bank,</b> and crashed into the Quattro of teammate Hannu Mikkola who had gone off at the same place. She eventually finished fifth. In Portugal, Mouton recorded 18 stage wins on her way to a clear victory ahead of Toyota's Per Eklund. She once admitted that to be competitive in the rally, she tried to think of the large crowds right {{by the side of the}} route as trees. At the Tour de Corse, she could not match the pace of the leaders and finished seventh. At the Acropolis Rally, Mouton won ahead of the Opel duo Walter Röhrl and Henri Toivonen, and closed to within 20 points of the championship leader Röhrl. The event was overshadowed by two serious accidents, one of which killed a spectator. Mouton had commented: [...] "I'm afraid that something might break in my car and I can no longer avoid hitting a spectator." ...|$|E
60|$|On September third {{we were up}} at five-thirty. It {{was clear}} and cold and the red of sunrise tinged the peaks. The <b>snow</b> <b>banks</b> looked pink. All the early morning scene was green, fresh, cool, with that {{mountain}} rareness of atmosphere.|$|R
60|$|During breakfast, we were {{discussing}} whether we could get through the snow to Mont St. Bernard. Some thought we could, and some thought not. So it goes here: we are gasping and sweltering one hour, and plunging through <b>snow</b> <b>banks</b> the next.|$|R
5000|$|A. siris is {{only found}} in alpine areas of Otago where it prefers wetland areas and <b>snow</b> <b>banks.</b> [...] It has been {{observed}} at altitudes of 1300 - 1500 metres. The species has been recorded in the Lammermoor Range, the Old Man and the Rock and Pillar ranges.|$|R
2500|$|If the snow-cover is substantial, {{then the}} {{shoulder}} (including the rumble strip) is usually partially snow-covered as the snowplow's wing-blade doesn't clear the entire shoulder. [...] Vehicles going {{off the road}} usually collide with the shoulder <b>snow</b> <b>bank</b> or go into a snow-filled ditch which reduces the possibility of serious damage and injury. [...] In these situations, the rumble strip effectiveness can be negated but the crash implications are mitigated by the <b>snow</b> <b>bank.</b>|$|E
2500|$|As Martin contorted on the floor, Schultz {{apologized to}} Davis for killing someone {{in front of}} him. When Davis later read a {{newspaper}} story about Martin's murder, he was shocked {{to find out that}} the body was found on a <b>snow</b> <b>bank</b> with a dozen stab wounds to the chest. When Davis asked Schultz about this, the boss dead-panned, [...] "I cut his heart out." ...|$|E

25|$|The first {{prototype}} of Subject 34 {{was completed in}} secret at the Kumertau helicopter plant in Bashkirya, but whilst carrying out taxi tests, in December 1978 piloted by K. V. Chernobrovkin, the prototype Chaika lifted off to avoid hitting <b>snow</b> <b>banks</b> and was destroyed after hitting a hillside in zero visibility.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are many}} reasons for that, Captain Gar'ner," [...] {{answered}} the mate. [...] "So many bodies in so small a space, the shelter from the wind and outer air, and the <b>snow</b> <b>banks,</b> all help us. I think we shall find the thermometer indoors at a pretty comfortable figure this morning." ...|$|R
5000|$|The City of Ottawa {{states that}} some cyclists may use {{vehicular}} cycling techniques for winter biking, including {{taking control of}} the lane when appropriate: [...] "Roads tend to be a bit narrower due to <b>snow</b> <b>banks.</b> Ride in the middle lane when necessary, which will prevent motorists from passing you too closely." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Beware them peaks! That wall {{so bright}} Is but a <b>snow</b> <b>bank,</b> gleaming white, Your paint wont stick!" [...] Came the reply, [...] "I've done it! 'How {{is that for}} high?'" [...] "SAPOLIO." ...|$|E
60|$|Setting off at once, they wearily {{struggled}} up the hill, and it {{had been}} dark some time when they made camp in a hollow {{at the foot of a}} great rock. It kept off the wind and the spruces which grew close about it further sheltered them, but Blake told his companions to throw up a <b>snow</b> <b>bank</b> while he cut wood.|$|E
60|$|Mr. George and Rollo {{both looked}} in the {{direction}} where Henry pointed, and there they saw a vast rocky precipice peering out through {{a break in the}} clouds high up in the sky. An immense <b>snow</b> <b>bank</b> was reposing upon its summit. The glittering whiteness of this snow contrasted strongly with the sombre gray of the clouds through which, as through an opening in a curtain, it was seen.|$|E

50|$|In 1940, {{traffic on}} Quebec Route 143—the area's main route at the time—was halted due to {{snowfall}} from March 22 to April 3. Dufferin Heights was most affected. As volunteers attempted {{to clear the}} road with shovels, the <b>snow</b> <b>banks</b> became so high that steps needed to be carved into them. Trains were similarly affected, although able to dig out more quickly.|$|R
60|$|I {{believe he}} had seen {{us out of the}} window coming off to dine in the dinghy of a fourteen-ton yawl {{belonging}} to Marlow my host and skipper. We helped the boy we had with us to haul the boat up on the landing-stage before we went up to the riverside inn, where we found our new acquaintance eating his dinner in dignified loneliness {{at the head of a}} long table, white and inhospitable like a <b>snow</b> <b>bank.</b>|$|E
60|$|At dusk he {{camped in}} {{a clump of}} dry willows by a river. The snow had stopped, but a bitter wind blew down the valley and the cold was intense. When he had eaten a meal Thirlwell sat {{with his back to}} a <b>snow</b> <b>bank</b> and a big fire in front, holding up a {{moccasin}} to the blaze. This was necessary because moccasins absorb moisture during a long day's march, and the man who puts them on while damp risks getting frozen feet.|$|E
6000|$|One {{thing more}} as to botanical names. What does possess botanists to afflict the most fragile and {{delicate}} of earth's children with such mountainous and unpronounceable names? Now {{there was a}} dear little flower that I first met at St. Bernard--a little purple bell, with a fringe; it is more particularly beautiful from its growing just {{on the verge of}} avalanches, coming up and blossoming through the snow. I send you one in this letter, which I dug out of a <b>snow</b> <b>bank</b> this morning. And this fair creation--this hope upon a death bed--this image of love unchilled and immortal--how I wanted to know it by name! ...|$|E
50|$|The Hall Natural Area {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{established}} in California (in 1933). TheCarnegie Institution of Washington’s studies on genotype-environment interactions made much use of the transplant gardens at the south end of the Natural Area. Sincethen, other researchers have used the area, studying social organization of Belding ground squirrels, dynamics of wind-blown detritus in <b>snow</b> <b>banks,</b> and community structuring of subalpine forest birds.|$|R
5000|$|On 7 March 2011, an Air Iceland Bombardier Q100 Dash 8 {{aircraft}} {{suffered a}} collapsed right landing gear whilst landing at Nuuk Airport, Greenland. Several of the 31 Passengers on board reported a severe crosswind gust {{immediately prior to}} the main gear touching down, {{which resulted in the}} aircraft drifting over and subsequently making contact with <b>snow</b> <b>banks</b> alongside the runway, causing the right gear to collapse.|$|R
50|$|Saxifraga hyperborea, the Pygmy saxifrage, is a {{plant species}} native to Canada, Alaska, Greenland, Russia, Spitsbergen, and from mountainous {{areas in the}} western United States. One report from Mount Washington in New Hampshire is unverified. The plant grows in wet tundra, <b>snow</b> <b>banks,</b> stream banks and lake sides at {{elevations}} up to 3000 m. The US populations have been called S. debilis or S. rivularis in various publications.|$|R
60|$|Now let us {{take the}} {{concrete}} incident. Before that hypocritical thaw early in February, Jethro called upon Amos Cuthbert--not so surly then as he has since become--and talked about buying his wool when it should be duly cut, and permitted Amos {{to talk about the}} position of second selectman, for which some person or persons unknown to the jury had nominated him. On his way down to the Four Corners, Jethro had merely pulled up his sleigh before Eben Williams's house, which stood behind a huge <b>snow</b> <b>bank</b> and practically on the road. Eben appeared at the door, a little dishevelled in hair and beard, for he had been sleeping.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis for the rebuking of evildoers an' the keeping of {{the peace}} we're sent here to patrol the wilderness, an' if we're frozen stiff in the saddle 'tis no more than our duty," [...] said the sergeant, while his eyes twinkled whimsically. [...] "But a man with lands an' cattle shows a {{distressful}} want o' judgment by sleeping in a <b>snow</b> <b>bank</b> when he might be sitting snug in a club at Montreal. 'Tis a matter o' wonder to me that ye are whiles so deficient in common sense, Rancher Ormesby. Still, I'm no' denying ye showed a little when ye brought that whisky. 'Tis allowable to interpret the regulations with discretion in bitter weather--an' here's a safe ride to ye!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{doubt whether}} Eustace did not {{internally}} pronounce {{the whole thing}} a bore, until I led him to my predecessor's little ruined, rustic summer house, midway on the hillside. It is a mere skeleton of slender, decaying tree trunks, with neither walls nor a roof; nothing but a tracery of branches and twigs, which the next wintry blast will be very likely to scatter in fragments along the terrace. It looks, and is, as evanescent as a dream; and yet, in its rustic network of boughs, it has somehow enclosed a hint of spiritual beauty, {{and has become a}} true emblem of the subtile and ethereal mind that planned it. I made Eustace Bright sit down on a <b>snow</b> <b>bank,</b> which had heaped itself over the mossy seat, and gazing through the arched windows opposite, he acknowledged that the scene at once grew picturesque.|$|E
50|$|The {{game was}} played at Ohio Stadium, in Columbus, Ohio under severe weather that altered the normal playing of the game dramatically. The {{conditions}} were deplorable with the temperature at 10 degrees, winds gusting to 28 miles per hour out of the northwest and snow falling at two inches per hour. <b>Snow</b> <b>banks</b> lined the field, yard lines were obliterated and at times so, too, were the goal posts.|$|R
5000|$|After a snowfall, the Levins {{would climb}} {{onto the roof}} to shovel snow off it. Wright made the Usonian houses feel like a {{comfortable}} shelter by lowering the ceilings to “human proportions”. [...] In {{a section of the}} Levin House, the roof is about five feet from the ground, when outside. The Levin children loved the low roof because in the winter they would jump off of it and into the <b>snow</b> <b>banks.</b>|$|R
