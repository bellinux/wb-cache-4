2500|$|Powell's chief {{role was}} to garner {{international}} support for a multi-national coalition to mount the invasion. To this end, Powell addressed a plenary session of the United Nations Security Council on February 5, 2003, to argue in favor of military action. Citing numerous anonymous Iraqi defectors, Powell asserted that [...] "there {{can be no doubt}} that <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more, many more." [...] Powell also stated that there was [...] "no doubt in my mind" [...] that Saddam was working to obtain key components to produce nuclear weapons.|$|E
5000|$|According to Arab media, <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> opened {{training}} camps in Iraq for Arab volunteers willing {{to carry out}} suicide bombings against U.S. forces, if an attack on Iraq takes place.|$|E
5000|$|Rodrigo Alvarez Cambra {{confirms}} that <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> been his patient {{over the last}} two decades, stating that he has developed a [...] "close relationship with Saddam" [...] in the time they worked together.|$|E

50|$|Iraq under Baathist <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> {{much the}} same {{techniques}} of press censorship as did Romania under Nicolae Ceauşescu but with greater potential violence.|$|R
5000|$|As {{he leaves}} the building, he passes a {{newspaper}} stand where the headlines declare the official end of the Cold War. Four weeks later, whilst fishing outside his retirement cottage, he hears over the radio that <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> invaded Kuwait. Upon hearing this news, vindicated and unmoved, he decides it's [...] "time to change his bait".|$|E
50|$|Aznar: It is very {{important}} to have a resolution. It is not the same to act with it as without it. It would be very advisable to have a majority in the Security Council that supported that resolution. In fact, {{it is important to have}} it passed by a majority, even if someone exercises a veto. Let us consider that the text of the resolution would have among other things to state that <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> lost his opportunity.|$|E
5000|$|Ba'athist Iraq under Saddam Hussein pursued ethnic {{cleansing}} or the liquidation of minorities, pursued expansionist wars against Iran and Kuwait, and gradually replaced pan-Arabism with an Iraqi nationalism that emphasized Iraq's {{connection to the}} glories of ancient Mesopotamian empires, including Babylonia. Historian on fascism Stanley Payne has said about Saddam Hussein's regime: [...] "There will probably never again be a reproduction of the Third Reich, but <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> come closer than any other dictator since 1945".|$|E
25|$|ITN {{reporter}} Terry Lloyd, {{who originally}} {{broke the news}} that <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> used chemical weapons, was killed by US forces near Basra on March 22, 2003.|$|R
50|$|In 1988, Lloyd {{broke the}} news that <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> used {{chemical}} weapons in Halabja, killing 5,000 Kurds. In 1999, {{he became the first}} foreign journalist to enter Kosovo.|$|R

It postulated an operational relationship between Saddam Hussein's Iraq and the al-Qaeda terrorist organization called [...] His major source was a leaked memo from Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Douglas J. Feith to the U.S. Congress on 27 October 2003. His other books were biographies of Paul Wolfowitz and Dick Cheney.|$|E
5000|$|The {{transcript}} {{begins with}} Bush saying {{he wants to}} pursue a second resolution quickly, {{two or three days}} after the meeting. Aznar prefers three days later so the General Affairs and External Relations Council can meet beforehand. Bush envisions a resolution similar to one passed during the Kosovo conflict, and [...] "he wants it written so that it does not contain obligatory elements, that does not mention the use of force, and that states that <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> been unable to fulfill his obligations." ...|$|E
50|$|Bush: Yes, by all means. It {{would be}} better to have a {{reference}} to “necessary means” reference to the type of UN resolution that authorizes the use of “all necessary means”.Aznar: <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> not cooperated, has not been disarmed; we would have to summarize his breaches and to send a more detailed message. That would allow, for example, Mexico to move reference to a change in its negative position on the second resolution, the extent of which Aznar could have known about from the lips of president Vicente Fox on Friday, February 21, in Mexico City.|$|E
25|$|A second {{unofficial}} video, apparently showing Saddam's body on a trolley, emerged {{several days}} later. It sparked {{speculation that the}} execution was carried out incorrectly as <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> a gaping hole in his neck.|$|R
50|$|The {{resolution}} was passed during tensions regarding {{the invasion of}} Kuwait by Iraq, with which <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> been attempting to link {{the resolution of the}} Kuwaiti problem with a solution to the Palestinian issue.|$|R
5000|$|This {{claim is}} however disputed. Dr Ala Bashir, Saddam Hussein's former {{personal}} physician, stated, [...] "The stories about <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>having</b> body doubles, {{to foster the}} impression that the Iraqi dictator was everywhere, are nonsense." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bush: It {{could be}} in the evening Monday, {{considering}} the time difference. In any case, the next week. We will see that the resolution is written so that it does not contain obligatory steps Iraq, that it does not mention the use of force, and that it states that <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> been unable to fulfill his obligations. That type of resolution can be voted for by many people. It would be something similar to the one passed regarding Kosovo 10th of June 1999.Aznar: Would it be presented to the Security Council before, and independently of, a parallel declaration? ...|$|E
5000|$|In the {{run up to}} the 2003 Iraq War, he {{addressed}} parliament saying [...] "The body of evidence that Saddam Hussein possesses a fearsome range {{of weapons of mass}} destruction is substantial.. Let us be clear: <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> weapons of mass destruction and he is a threat to his people, his neighbours and ultimately the middle east and the wider world. Before adding [...] "If we have to undertake military action and American and British troops are committed and have to go into Baghdad, I suspect that the Iraqi people will be the first to cheer." ...|$|E

50|$|Joscelyn reasserted the {{conjecture}} that <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> {{a cooperative}} relationship with al-Qaeda. However, the official conclusions of investigations by the CIA, FBI, NSA, State Department, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, {{and the independent}} 9/11 Commission have all confirmed Pillar's view {{that there was no}} collaborative relationship between <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> and al-Qaeda.|$|R
50|$|The next {{targets were}} command and {{communication}} facilities. <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> closely micromanaged Iraqi {{forces in the}} Iran-Iraq War, and initiative at lower levels was discouraged.

5000|$|... it is a {{last resort}} because <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> a record of attacking his neighbors, of the 'headlong pursuit and {{development}} of biochemical and nuclear weapons of mass destruction' and their use against his own people, and harboring al-Qaeda terrorists ...|$|R
5000|$|Gerald and Linda Polley {{created a}} body of work {{including}} songs, drawings and short animations, some of which they claimed was made while channelling the spirits of dead artists. Some of this work is political in nature: [...] "Hussein's Butt Song", allegedly written by the spirit of John Lennon about <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein,</b> <b>has</b> lyrics such as [...] "we kicked his butt before and we kicked his butt again, we got him in the heine, he knew he could not win". Another song, attacking Hillary Clinton and cross-dressing, contains the lyrics [...] "if you want your sons wearing skirts and panty hose, with lipstick on their faces and shiny nail polish that glows, then vote for Hillary".|$|E
5000|$|In doing so, Rothman {{stated that}} [...] "now, {{especially}} in the light and shadow of September 11, {{there is a new}} immediacy and power to Saddam Hussein's longstanding and oft-stated threats against America. For years, <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> been a well-known patron and financier of some of the world's most lethal anti-American terrorist and terrorist organizations. Now, al Qaeda has joined him....The thought of Saddam Hussein sending these same al-Qaeda 'martyrs' to America to spray chemical or biological poisons over America's reservoirs in our most populated cities, is a thought so horrifying, yet so real a possibility, that I cannot in good conscience especially after the surprise attack of Sept. 22, permit this to happen." ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{few days}} before the U.S. Senate vote on the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution, about 75 {{senators}} are told in closed session that <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> the means of delivering biological and chemical weapons of mass destruction by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) drones that could be launched from ships off the Atlantic coast to attack U.S. eastern seaboard cities. Colin Powell suggested in his presentation to the United Nations that UAVs were transported out of Iraq and could be launched against the U.S. In fact, Iraq had no fleet of UAVs nor any capability of putting UAVs on ships. [...] Iraq's UAV fleet consisted of less than a handful of outdated Czech training drones. At the time, there was a vigorous dispute within the intelligence community as to whether CIA had conclusions about Iraqi UAVs were accurate. The U.S. Air Force agency most familiar with UAVs denied outright that Iraq possessed any offensive UAV capability.|$|E

5000|$|In the book, CIA {{director}} George Tenet {{is noted}} as stating {{the evidence that}} <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> {{weapons of mass destruction}} was [...] "a slam dunk".

50|$|In {{a column}} for WorldNetDaily, Cohen claimed that 100 of these mini-nukes were {{in the hands of}} terrorists, and later that <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> taken {{delivery}} of about fifty of these devices, which he supposedly planned on using against the US forces as they approached Baghdad.|$|R
5000|$|In Clinton's 1998 State of the Union Address, {{he warned}} Congress that Iraqi {{dictator}} Saddam Hussein was building {{an arsenal of}} chemical, biological and nuclear weapons: <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> {{spent the better part}} of this decade, and much of his nation's wealth, not on providing for the Iraqi people, but on developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them. The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job, finding and destroying more of Iraq's arsenal than was destroyed during the entire gulf war. Now, Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission.

5000|$|Nina (Fanny Ardant), a French concert pianist, meets Ilan (...) , an Israeli {{computer}} {{specialist who}} is on vacation, in Paris. They fall in love, marry, and, move to Israel with their son, Gili (Daniele Napolitano). Not much later, Ilan is drafted into the Israeli military for compulsory military service, as {{the situation in the}} Middle East is worsening: <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> attacked Kuwait with his Iraqi forces and the Second Gulf War is imminent. After Nina is accepted into the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, she receives a call from the military and learns that her husband was wounded during a battle. She hurries to him and finds out, to her horror, that Ilan was not injured by enemy troops but by Israeli soldiers when he tried to leave his post illegally. While Ilan is wounded in a hospital and is unable to speak due to a state of shock, the accusations that he is a deserter, she finds out, are true. Despite this revelation, Nina continues to take care of him, breaks off an affair with another man, and tries to understand his motives. Their environment's reaction, however, extends not only to Ilan but also to Nina. When Nina's concert debut with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra is about to take place, symbolically, {{on the day of the}} United Nations' ultimatum to Saddam Hussein, the social pressure grows immeasurably. Nina leaves Ilan and returns to France with Gili.|$|E
