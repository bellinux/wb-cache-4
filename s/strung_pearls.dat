5000|$|<b>Pearls</b> <b>Strung</b> by Ella Weed, 1898. A posthumously-published {{anthology}} of selections from Weed's favorite authors.|$|R
50|$|Sri Aurobindo {{had said}} that the {{fundamental}} necessity of our embodied life is to seek infinite creativity on a finite basis, therefore, according to the Theosophists death is a transformative experience. Sutratman, the spiritual thread, thread of life, is the Monad, the golden thread of the transcendent contexts on which all the immanent incarnate of each individual human are <b>strung</b> like <b>pearls</b> on a thread.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm glad, glad, {{glad to see}} you out again!" [...] she cried, {{every word}} a <b>pearl</b> <b>strung</b> on the string of her sentence. [...] "You are well, Tommy--or better, of course. I wanted to come to see you, but they wouldn't let me." ...|$|R
50|$|Renowned {{musician}} Bhimsen Joshi did {{not hear}} Gururao Deshpande sing until the latter was well known. He then celebrated “Shastabdi Samaroh” for Gururao Deshpande on 14 April 1962, in Pune. During this function, guest of honour Krishna Rao described Deshpande’s music as the “finest of <b>pearls</b> <b>strung</b> together”.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's Janie Mannering," [...] she said, {{pointing}} to a superb, white-haired dame, whose satin robes seemed <b>strung</b> with <b>pearls.</b> [...] "I must have told you how she found her cook drunk under the kitchen table when the Empress was coming to dinner, and tucked up her velvet sleeves (she always dressed like an Empress herself), cooked the whole meal, and appeared in the drawing-room as if she'd been sleeping on a bank of roses all day. She could do anything with her hands--they all could--make a cottage or embroider a petticoat.|$|R
50|$|The hymns of Ṛgveda {{are one of}} the {{earliest}} texts composed in verse. The Brāhmaṇa which belongs to the middle vedic period followed by the vedāṇga are composed in prose. The basic texts are composed in an aphoristic style known as the sutra which literally means thread on which each aphorism is <b>strung</b> like a <b>pearl.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Parabrahma Upanishad {{primarily}} {{describes the}} tradition of the sacred thread and topknot hair tuft worn by housesholders and why both are abandoned by Sannyasi after they have renounced for monastic lifestyle in the Hindu Ashrama system. The text asserts that knowledge is the inner sacrificial string of the renouncers, and knowledge is their true topknot. These wandering monks, states Patrick Olivelle, consider Brahman (unchanging, ultimate reality) as their inner [...] "supreme string on which the entire universe is <b>strung</b> like <b>pearls</b> on a string". This repeated emphasis on knowledge and the abandonment of external dress and rituals in exchange for the inner equivalent of Atman-Brahman in this medieval era text is similar to those in the ancient Upanishads.|$|R
5000|$|Waris Shah had a {{great deal}} of reverence for his teacher, and it is well noted in his epic Heer Ranjha in which he states [...] "Waris Shah is proud of being the pupil of great Makhdum, the Kasur's symbol" [...] When Waris Shah came to Ghulam Murtaza to present his epic Heer Ranjha and gain blessings from his spiritual teacher, Ghulam Murtaza is alleged to have said [...] "I taught Bulleh Shah and he danced and sang playing a violin. I taught you and you wrote a love story". However, once having heard {{sections}} from the Heer from Waris Shah himself, Ghulam Murtaza is said to have been consoled and blessed Waris with a powerful remark, [...] "You have <b>strung</b> priceless <b>pearls</b> into a rosary".|$|R
50|$|The {{upper and}} lower edges of the crown are {{decorated}} with <b>pearls</b> <b>strung</b> on a metal wire attached to the circlet by metal rings. Numerous pearls and gemstones decorate {{the main body of}} the crown and the lilies, with particularly precious stones placed directly under the lilies. Highlights include a Late Antique engraved gem depicting the head of Medusa and a sapphire in a triangular gold ring at the front of the crown.|$|R
50|$|She {{tells the}} story that one night she was awoken by a hard blow to her body. The pain ran down her spinal column and she bent {{backwards}} in an arch. She felt an immense, warm caress massaging her entire body. She went back to sleep, but then experienced a second, even stronger, blow. She felt as if her heart had stopped, then {{she felt as if}} she was flying above the planet. She could see herself lying on a bed and she felt the presence of something at her side emanating an ever-increasing, overwhelming love. She asked herself if this intense presence could be God. During the course of her life she had questioned the existence of God on many occasions. Suddenly she heard herself asking God, “Do you forgive me?” Then, from deep inside her, all the most important events of her life passed before her, as if they were <b>pearls</b> <b>strung</b> together side by side on a necklace. She understood the meaning of these events and how they had changed her life. She felt complete bliss. When this experience finished, she got up from her bed as if she had never been ill. She was “reborn”.|$|R
6000|$|Sometimes, {{however, the}} {{prospect}} a little chilled him. Could he give them all up,--the sweet sister; the {{friend of his}} childhood; the grave instructor of his youth; the homely, life-known faces? Yes; there were such rich possibilities in the future: for he would seek out the noblest minds, the deepest hearts in every age, and be the friend of human time. Only it might be sweet to have one unchangeable companion; for, unless he <b>strung</b> the <b>pearls</b> and diamonds of life upon one unbroken affection, he sometimes thought that his life would have nothing to give it unity and identity; and so the longest life would be but an aggregate of insulated fragments, which would have no relation to one another. And so {{it would not be}} one life, but many unconnected ones. Unless he could look into the same eyes, through the mornings of future time, opening and blessing him with the fresh gleam of love and joy; unless the same sweet voice could melt his thoughts together; unless some sympathy of a life side by side with his could knit them into one; looking back upon the same things, looking forward to the same; the long, thin thread of an individual life, stretching onward and onward, would cease to be visible, cease to be felt, cease, by and by, to have any real bigness in proportion to its length, and so be virtually non-existent, except in the mere inconsiderable Now. If a group of chosen friends, chosen out of all the world for their adaptedness, could go on in endless life together, keeping themselves mutually warm on the high, desolate way, then none of them need ever sigh to be comforted in the pitiable snugness of the grave. If one especial soul might be his companion, then how complete the fence of mutual arms, the warmth of close-pressing breast to breast! Might there be one! O Sibyl Dacy! ...|$|R
60|$|My {{thoughts}} were not {{exactly in the}} vein to enjoy the embarrassment of Moses, and I silenced him by promising all he asked. We were not elegant enough to meet at the church, but I proceeded at once to the little rectory, where I found the good divine and my lovely bride had just completed their arrangements. And lovely, indeed, was Lucy, in her simple but beautiful bridal attire! She was unattended, had none of those gay appliances about her that her condition might have rendered proper, and which her fortune would so easily have commanded. Yet {{it was impossible to}} be in her presence without feeling the influence of her virgin mien and simple elegance. Her dress was a spotless but exquisitely fine India muslin, well made and accurately fitting; and her dark glossy hair was embellished only by one comb ornamented with pearls, and wearing the usual veil. As for her feet and hands, they were more like those of a fairy than of one human; while her countenance was filled with all the heartfelt tenderness of her honest nature. Around her ivory throat, and over her polished shoulders, hung my own necklace of <b>pearls,</b> <b>strung</b> as they had been on board the Crisis, giving her bust an air of affluent decoration, while it told a long story of distant adventure and of well-requited affection.|$|R
60|$|I {{had plenty}} of time to think of this, for the rain kept me {{practically}} housed for the first twenty-four hours. It had been raining in, these regions for a month, and people had begun to look askance at the Rhone, though as yet the volume of the river was not exorbitant. The only excursion possible, while the torrent descended, was a kind of horizontal dive, ac- companied with infinite splashing, to the little musee of the town, which is within a moderate walk of the hotel. I had a memory of it from my first visit; it had appeared to me more pictorial than its pictures. I found that recollection had flattered it a little, and that it is neither better nor worse than most provincial museums. It has the usual musty chill in the air, the usual grass-grown fore-court, in which a few lumpish Roman fragments are disposed, the usual red tiles on the floor, and the usual specimens of the more livid schools on the walls. I rang up the gardien, who ar- rived with a bunch of keys, wiping his mouth; he un- locked doors for me, opened shutters, and while (to my distress, as if the things had been worth lingering over) he shuffled about after me, he announced the names of the pictures before which I stopped, in a voice that reverberated through the melancholy halls, and seemed to make the authorship shameful when it was obscure, and grotesque when it pretended to be great. Then there were intervals of silence, while I stared absent-mindedly, at hap-hazard, at some indis- tinguishable canvas, and the only sound was the down- pour of the rain on the skylights. The museum of Avignon derives a certain dignity from its Roman frag- ments. The town has no Roman monuments to show; in this respect, beside its brilliant neighbors, Arles and Nimes, it is a blank. But a great many small objects have been found in its soil, - pottery, glass, bronzes, lamps, vessels and ornaments of gold and silver. The glass is especially chaming, - small vessels of the most delicate shape and substance, many of them perfectly preserved. These diminutive, intimate things bring one near to the old Roman life; they seem like <b>pearls</b> <b>strung</b> upon the slender thread that swings across the gulf of time. A little glass cup that Roman lips have touched says more to us than the great vessel of an arena. There are two small silver casseroles, with chi- selled handles, in the museum of Avignon, that struck me as among the most charming survivals of anti- quity.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Saltram {{made a great}} {{affair of}} her right to be {{informed}} where {{her husband had been}} the second evening he failed to meet his audience. She came to me to ascertain, but I couldn't satisfy her, for in spite of my ingenuity I remained in ignorance. It wasn't till much later that I found this had not been the case with Kent Mulville, whose hope for the best never twirled the thumbs of him more placidly than when he happened to know the worst. He had known it on the occasion I speak of--that is immediately after. He was impenetrable then, but ultimately confessed. What he confessed was more than I shall now venture to make public. It was of course familiar to me that Saltram was incapable of keeping the engagements which, after their separation, he had entered into with regard to his wife, a deeply wronged, justly resentful, quite irreproachable and insufferable person. She often appeared at my chambers to talk over his lapses; for if, as she declared, she had washed her hands of him, she had carefully preserved the water of this ablution, which she handed about for analysis. She had arts of her own of exciting one's impatience, the most infallible of which was perhaps her assumption that we were kind to her because we liked her. In reality her personal fall had been a sort of social rise--since I had seen the moment when, in our little conscientious circle, her desolation almost made her the fashion. Her voice was grating and her children ugly; moreover she hated the good Mulvilles, whom I more and more loved. They were the people who by doing most for her husband had in the long run done most for herself; and the warm confidence with which he had laid his length upon them was a pressure gentle compared with her stiffer persuadability. I'm bound to say he didn't criticise his benefactors, though practically he got tired of them; she, however, had the highest standards about eleemosynary forms. She offered the odd spectacle of a spirit puffed up by dependence, and indeed it had introduced her to some excellent society. She pitied me for not knowing certain people who aided her and whom she doubtless patronised in turn for their luck in not knowing me. I dare say I should have got on with her better if she had had a ray of imagination--if it had occasionally seemed to occur to her to regard Saltram's expressions of his nature in any other manner than as separate subjects of woe. They were all flowers of his character, <b>pearls</b> <b>strung</b> on an endless thread; but she had a stubborn little way of challenging them one after the other, as if she never suspected that he HAD a character, such as it was, or that deficiencies might be organic; the irritating effect of a mind incapable of a generalisation. One might doubtless have overdone the idea that there was a general licence for such a man; but if this had happened it would have been through one's feeling that there could be none for such a woman.|$|R
60|$|It {{was very}} cold {{the other day}} at Avignon, for {{though there was no}} mistral, it was raining as it rains in Provence, and the {{dampness}} had a terrible chill in it. As I sat by my fire late at night--for in genial Avignon, in October, I had to have a fire--it came back to me that eleven years before I had at that same hour sat by a fire in that same room and, writing to a friend to whom I was not afraid to appear extravagant, had made a vow that at some happier period of the future I would avenge myself on the ci-devant city of the Popes by taking it in a contrary sense. I suppose that I redeemed my vow on the occasion of my second visit better than on my third; for then I {{was on my way to}} Italy, and that vengeance, of course, was complete. The only drawback was that I was in such a hurry to get to Ventimiglia (where the Italian custom-house was to be the sign of my triumph), that I scarcely took time to make it clear to myself at Avignon that this was better than reading the Figaro. I hurried on almost too fast to enjoy the consciousness of moving southward. On this last occasion I was unfortunately destitute of that happy faith. Avignon was my southernmost limit, after which I was to turn round and proceed back to England. But in the interval I had been a great deal in Italy, and that made all the difference. I had plenty of time to think of this, for the rain kept me practically housed for the first twenty-four hours. It had been raining in these regions for a month, and people had begun to look askance at the Rhone, though as yet the volume of the river was not exorbitant.

40|$|The {{olfactory}} system plays {{a leading role}} in the perception of flavors, even though we experience this perception in our oral cavity as "taste". Without a sense of smell, food loses all but its most elementary flavor qualities. 	Smell begins in the periphery with the olfactory epithelium, a thin tissue lining the bones of the upper nasal cavity (1). Residing in this tissue are upwards of several million bipolar shaped cells which are the primary olfactory sensory neurons. At one end of these neurons there are hair-like projections called cilia. Residing within the membranes of these cilia are the proteins that make up the molecular machinery for detecting odor molecules that are breathed into the nasal cavity and become adsorbed to the mucus (2). 	These include, first and foremost, the receptor protein or “odor receptor”. This protein, made up of just over 300 amino acids <b>strung</b> together like <b>pearls</b> on a string, has a unique shape, including a pocket that allows for the entry and binding of specific odor molecules, much the way a lock permits certain shaped keys to be inserted. Again in analogy with a lock and key, where the right shaped key can open the lock, when a molecule fits into the binding pocket it is able to activate the receptor. This sets in motion a series of events through "second messenger" proteins which very rapidly cause an electrical change in the state of the sensory neuron. It is this electrical change, encoded in trains of changing voltage impulses, that signals to the brain the presence of a particular odor molecule. 	 There are nearly 400 different odor receptors expressed by the various neurons of the epithelium in humans (3). However even this large number of receptors is insufficient to explain our ability to detect and identify many thousands of diverse chemicals as odorants (one recent report claims we have the potential to discriminate trillions!). It is hypothesized that there is a combinatorial code in which any given odor can be detected by several receptors and any given receptor can bind any of several presumably related odors. In our analogy, the keys fit very loosely to differing degrees into many locks. 	Chemists are particularly interested in those parts of a molecule that are likely to participate in various sorts of reactions and synthetic manipulations. These would include such things as the functional group (aldehyde, acid, ester, etc.) or if there are double bonds or charge carrying atoms. However, what is relevant to the synthetic chemist may not be important to the biological system, and in particular to the odor receptor protein. Thus we should begin by taking a biological approach to odor chemistry. For example the definition of an odorant cannot be made chemically – many chemical compounds that appear nearly identical to a known odorant may have a different smell or none at all. The only definition of an odorant is that it binds to an odor receptor to give rise to a biological response. Precisely what parts of a chemical compound influence that binding is one of the most challenging questions in biology. 	The actual perception of an odorant depends on the particular combination of receptors that are activated. In a complex mixture of tens to hundreds of different odor molecules this can quickly become a very complicated matrix of activated receptors with an astronomical number of combinations. An open question is whether evolution has perhaps found a simplified way of performing this apparently incalculable task. One possible solution would be the existence of a few dozen common chemical structures that would serve as primary features from which all other odors are constructed. This would be similar to the way the visual system can perceive thousands of hues of light by combining only three (blue, green and red) primary “colors” or wavelengths. Although the idea of primaries in olfaction has been discussed for several decades it was largely abandoned after the discovery of the large family of receptors. Now we are recognizing that it might be required after all, and with new molecular tools we may be able to understand better the basic mystery of how biological entities encode chemicals. 	The perception of the odor code is affected by whether we are activating the olfactory receptor cells by sniffing in ("orthonasal smell") or by breathing out ("retronasal smell"). When breathing in, the odor chemical code is perceived as smell. When breathing out during eating, the code is combined with the input from the other senses to form the merged perception of flavor. This challenges current research in analyzing the specific roles of smell in flavors that lead to healthy or unhealthy eating, as the talks at this conference document...|$|R
