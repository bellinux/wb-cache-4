A basic limitation of the technique is the chromatic dispersion of grating diffraction, which limits its spatial resolution. A tabletop system with a tungsten-target x-ray tube running at 60kVp will have a limiting resolution of 60µm. Another constraint is that the x-ray beam is <b>slitted</b> down to only tens of micrometers wide. A potential solution has been proposed in the form of parallel imaging with multiple slits.|$|E
25|$|Taxes {{and fines}} were paid in cash. Javanese economy had been partly monetised {{since the late}} 8th century, using gold and silver coins. Previously, the 9th-century Wonoboyo hoard {{discovered}} in Central Java shows that ancient Javan gold coins were seed-shaped, similar to corn, while the silver coins were similar to buttons. In about the year 1300, in the reign of Majapahit's first king, an important change took place: the indigenous coinage was completely replaced by imported Chinese copper cash. About 10,388 ancient Chinese coins weighing about 40kg were even unearthed from the backyard of a local commoner in Sidoarjo in November 2008. Indonesian Ancient Relics Conservation Bureau (BP3) of East Java verified that those coins dated as early as Majapahit era. The reason for using foreign currency is not given in any source, but most scholars assume {{it was due to}} the increasing complexity of Javanese economy and a desire for a currency system that used much smaller denominations suitable for use in everyday market transactions. This was a role for which gold and silver are not well suited. These kepeng Chinese coins were thin rounded copper coins with a square hole in the centre of it. The hole was meant to tie together the money in a string of coins. These small changes—the imported Chinese copper coins—enabled Majapahit further invention, a method of savings by using a <b>slitted</b> earthenware coin containers. These are commonly found in Majapahit ruins, the slit is the small opening to put the coins in. The most popular shape is boar-shaped celengan (piggy bank).|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that the axon guidance proteins <b>Slit</b> 1 and <b>Slit</b> 2 co-operate to establish the optic chiasm in its correct position at the ventral diencephalic midline. This is based on the observation that, although both <b>Slit</b> 1 and <b>Slit</b> 2 are expressed around the ventral midline, mice defective in either gene alone exhibit few or no axon guidance defects at the optic chiasm whereas embryos lacking both <b>Slit</b> 1 and <b>Slit</b> 2 develop a large additional chiasm anterior to the chiasm’s normal position. Here we used steerable-filters to quantify key properties of the population of axons at the chiasm in wild-type, <b>Slit</b> 1 −/−, <b>Slit</b> 2 −/− and <b>Slit</b> 1 −/− <b>Slit</b> 2 −/− embryos. Results We applied the steerable-filter algorithm successfully to images of embryonic retinal axons labelled from a single eye shortly after they have crossed the midline. We combined data from multiple embryos of the same genotype and made statistical comparisons of axonal distributions, orientations and curvatures between genotype groups. We compared data from the analysis of axons with data on the expression of <b>Slit</b> 1 and <b>Slit</b> 2. The results showed a misorientation and a corresponding anterior shift in the position of many axons at the chiasm of both <b>Slit</b> 2 −/− and <b>Slit</b> 1 −/− <b>Slit</b> 2 −/− mutants. There were very few axon defects at the chiasm of <b>Slit</b> 1 −/− mutants. Conclusions We found defects of the chiasms of <b>Slit</b> 1 −/− <b>Slit</b> 2 −/− and <b>Slit</b> 1 −/− mutants similar to those reported previously. In addition, we discovered previously unreported defects resulting from loss of <b>Slit</b> 2 alone. This indicates the value of a quantitative approach to complex pathway analysis and shows that <b>Slit</b> 2 can act alone to control aspects of retinal axon routing across the ventral diencephalic midline. </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>Slits,</b> {{a family}} of {{secreted}} proteins, are crucial for axon guidance during {{the development of the}} central nervous system. In rats, <b>Slit</b> 1, <b>Slit</b> 2 and <b>Slit</b> 3 mRNA are expressed in midline glial populations surrounding the developing corpus callosum (Marillat et al., 2002). A previous study has shown that mice lacking the <b>Slit</b> 2 gene have an acallosal phenotype (Bagri et al., 2002). However, the role of <b>Slit</b> 1 and <b>Slit</b> 3 {{in the development of the}} corpus callosum is unknown. In the present study expression analysis of <b>Slit</b> 1, <b>Slit</b> 2 and <b>Slit</b> 3 mRNA performed on mice, showed that these molecules were expressed around the developing corpus callosum. To understand the role each <b>Slit</b> might play in the development of the corpus callosum, 4 <b>Slit</b> mutant mouse strains, <b>Slit</b> 1 -/-, <b>Slit</b> 2 -/-, <b>Slit</b> 1 -/-;Slit 2 -/- and <b>Slit</b> 3 -/- mice were analysed. This study confirmed that <b>Slit</b> 2 -/- mice displayed dysgenesis of the corpus callosum across its rostro-caudal extent. Mice lacking the <b>Slit</b> 1 gene did not exhibit an acallosal phenotype, however, <b>Slit</b> 1 -/-;Slit 2 -/- mice displayed a more severe phenotype compared to mice deficient in <b>Slit</b> 2 alone, indicating a role for <b>Slit</b> 1 in corpus callosum development. A subset of the <b>Slit</b> 3 -/- mice displayed an axon guidance defect in the corpus callosum, where the callosal axons in the dorsal region of the tract failed to cross the midline. This defect was observed in embryonic as well as postnatal ages. The callosal axon guidance defects in <b>Slit</b> 2 -/- and <b>Slit</b> 1 -/-;Slit 2 -/- mice were also observed at earlier stages during the development of the cingulate pioneering axons of the corpus callosum. Apart from axon guidance <b>Slit</b> 1, <b>Slit</b> 2 and <b>Slit</b> 3 were involved in the development of the glial populations at the midline of the cerebral cortex. <b>Slit</b> 2 -/- and <b>Slit</b> 1 -/-;Slit 2 -/- mice exhibited a positional defect where the indusium griseum glia was ventrally displaced. The glial-positioning defect in <b>Slit</b> 1 -/-;Slit 2 -/- mice was more severe compared to <b>Slit</b> 2 -/- mice. No positional defect was observed in <b>Slit</b> 3 -/- mice, however the development of the indusium griseum glia was affected. To compare the axon guidance phenotype of the <b>Slit</b> 2 -/- mice, and the knockout of its known receptor Robo 1 -/- mice, diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging and tractography was performed on <b>Slit</b> 2 -/-, and Robo 1 -/- mice. These experiments showed that the axon guidance defect in <b>Slit</b> 2 -/- mice is similar, but more severe compared to Robo 1 -/- mice. The axons of the CC are displaced rostrocaudally in both <b>Slit</b> 2 -/- and Robo 1 -/- mice. In Robo 1 -/- mice only the pre-crossing axons are affected while in <b>Slit</b> 2 -/- mice both the pre-crossing as well as post-crossing axons are affected. These results suggest a possible role for <b>Slit</b> in the development of the telencephalic midline, where it is first involved in the proper positioning and development of the midline glial populations and then acts as an axon guidance molecule for the crossing of callosal axons to their homotypic targets in the contralateral hemisphere...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe <b>Slit</b> {{molecules}} are chemorepulsive ligands {{that regulate}} axon guidance at the midline of both vertebrates and invertebrates. In mammals, {{there are three}} <b>Slit</b> genes, but only <b>Slit</b> 2 has been studied in any detail with regard to mammalian brain commissure formation. Here, we sought to understand the relative contributions that <b>Slit</b> proteins make {{to the formation of}} the largest brain commissure, the corpus callosum. <b>Slit</b> ligands bind Robo receptors, and previous studies have shown that Robo 1 −/− mice have defects in corpus callosum development. However, whether the <b>Slit</b> genes signal exclusively through Robo 1 during callosal formation is unclear. To investigate this, we compared the development of the corpus callosum in both <b>Slit</b> 2 −/− and Robo 1 −/− mice using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. This analysis demonstrated similarities in the phenotypes of these mice, but crucially also highlighted subtle differences, particularly with regard to the guidance of post-crossing axons. Analysis of single mutations in <b>Slit</b> family members revealed corpus callosum defects (but not complete agenesis) in 100 % of <b>Slit</b> 2 −/− mice and 30 % of <b>Slit</b> 3 −/− mice, whereas 100 % of <b>Slit</b> 1 −/−; <b>Slit</b> 2 −/− mice displayed complete agenesis of the corpus callosum. These results revealed a role for <b>Slit</b> 1 in corpus callosum development, and demonstrated that <b>Slit</b> 2 was necessary but not sufficient for midline crossing in vivo. However, co-culture experiments utilising Robo 1 −/− tissue versus <b>Slit</b> 2 expressing cell blocks demonstrated that <b>Slit</b> 2 was sufficient for the guidance activity mediated by Robo 1 in pre-crossing neocortical axons. This suggested that <b>Slit</b> 1 and <b>Slit</b> 3 might also be involved in regulating other mechanisms that allow the corpus callosum to form, such as the establishment of midline glial populations. Investigation of this revealed defects in the development and dorso-ventral positioning of the indusium griseum glia in multiple <b>Slit</b> mutants. These findings indicate that <b>Slits</b> regulate callosal development via both classical chemorepulsive mechanisms, and via a novel role in mediating the correct positioning of midline glial populations. Finally, our data also indicate that some of the roles of <b>Slit</b> proteins at the midline may be independent of Robo signalling, suggestive of additional receptors regulating <b>Slit</b> signalling during development...|$|R

40|$|The subventricular zone (SVZ) {{contains}} undifferentiated cells, which proliferate {{and generate}} olfactory bulb (OB) interneurons.

But this was a {{different}} thing, and a far less serious thing, than having a company. The boys began to have companies after every muster, of course; but sometimes they began to have them for no external reason. Very likely they would start having a company from just finding a rooster's tail-feather, and begin making plumes at once. It was easy to make a plume: you picked up a lot of feathers that the hens and geese had dropped; and you whittled a pine stick, and bound the feathers in spirals around it with white thread. That was a first-rate plume, but the uniform offered the same difficulties as the circus dress, and you could not do anything towards it by rolling up your pantaloons. It was pretty easy to make swords out of laths, but guns again were hard to realize. Some fellows had little toy guns left over from Christmas, but they were considered rather babyish, and any kind of stick was better; the right kind of a gun for a boy's company was a wooden gun, such as some of the big boys had, with the barrel painted different from the stock. The little fellows never had any such guns, and if the question of uniform could have been got over, this question of arms would still have remained. In these troubles the fellows' mothers had to suffer almost as much as the fellows themselves, the fellows teased them so much for bits of finery that they thought they could turn to account in eking out a uniform. Once it came to quite a lot of fellows getting their mothers to ask their fathers if they would buy them some little soldier-hats that one of the hatters had laid in, perhaps after a muster, when he knew the boys would begin recruiting. My boy was by when his mother asked his father, and stood with his heart in his mouth, while the question was argued; it was decided against him, both because his father hated the tomfoolery of the thing, and because he would not have the child honor any semblance of soldiering, even such a feeble image of it as a boys' company could present. But, after all, a paper chapeau, with a panache of <b>slitted</b> paper, was no bad soldier-hat; it went far to constitute a whole uniform; and it was this that the boys devolved upon at last. It was the only company they ever really got together, for everybody wanted to be captain and lieutenant, just as they wanted to be clown and ring-master in a circus. I cannot understand how my boy came to hold either office; perhaps the fellows found {{that the only way to}} keep the company together was to take turn-about; but, at any rate, he was marshalling his forces near his grandfather's gate one evening when his grandfather came home to tea. The old Methodist class-leader, who had been born and brought up a Quaker, stared at the poor little apparition in horror. Then he caught the paper chapeau from the boy's head, and, saying [...] "Dear me! Dear me!" [...] trampled it under foot. It was an awful moment, and in his hot and bitter heart the boy, who was put to shame before all his fellows, did not know whether to order them to attack his grandfather in a body, or to engage him in single combat with his own lath-sword. In the end he did neither; his grandfather walked on into tea, and the boy was left with a wound that was sore till he grew old enough to know how true and brave a man his grandfather was in a cause where so many warlike hearts wanted courage.|$|E
40|$|Both neurons and the axons {{that extend}} from them must travel long {{distances}} {{to reach their}} final destinations in developing embryos. Some of the same cues that guide axons to their targets also influence the migration of neural crest (NC) cells. <b>Slits</b> are known to guide the migration of several classes of axons and neurons. In this thesis, we have expanded this knowledge by examining several in vitro and in vivo functions of <b>Slit</b> 2 and its homolog, <b>Slit</b> 1, in axon guidance and NC migration. We have found that: (1) <b>Slit</b> 1 and <b>Slit</b> 2 act as chemorepellents for cultured embryonic retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons; (2) Over-expression of a truncated form of the <b>Slit</b> receptor Robo 1, Robo 1 -Δ- 67, blocks the activities of <b>Slit</b> 1 and <b>Slit</b> 2 in cultured RGC neurons; (3) <b>Slit</b> 1 and <b>Slit</b> 2 act as chemorepellents for migrating NC cells in vitro, and (4) Mis-expression of <b>Slit</b> 2 inhibits NC migration, resulting in smaller-sized dorsal root ganglia (DRG). The NC cells {{that give rise to}} adrenomedullary cells stop their migration and cluster adjacent to <b>Slit</b> 2 expressing regions in the embryo. These results suggest that <b>Slit</b> 2 acts as a stop signal for the migrating NC cells that later differentiate into the adrenomedullary cells. ...|$|R
