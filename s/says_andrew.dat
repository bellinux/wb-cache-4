40|$|Imagine this: {{extension}} {{workers and}} technicians who {{go around the}} country in mobile offices equipped {{with a wide range of}} top-notch ICTs such as a global positioning system (GPS) device, digital cameras and laptops. With this equipment they have immediate access to vital agricultural information and can make recommendations to farmers on the spot. As a result, the technicians are able to spend 95 % of their time in the field instead of the office, providing direct technical assistance to farmers. This is not a distant future scenario, but is already happening in Honduras, where staff of the US-based agribusiness development consultancy Fintrac are working to increase sales of non-traditional horticultural produce and boost the incomes of smallholder farmers. It all started in 2000, when the USAID-funded Center for Developing Agribusiness (CDA) took on the task of revitalizing the Honduran non-traditional agricultural sector after the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch. Fintrac, which has a long track record in providing technical assistance in the Caribbean and Africa, was called upon to support farmers, food processors, exporters, and allied agribusinesses all along the farm-to-market chain. Its task is to manage knowledge, monitor and evaluate client farmers, disseminate technical information, and make market research data and information available to field technicians and clients. The programme collaborates with 500 ´lead partners´, and provides direct services to a further 5000 small farmers, focusing on improving production and post-harvest systems, market linkages, and infrastructure. To ensure the smooth operation of all the different information channels, the innovative use of ICTs has been decisive. While implementing the CDA programme in Honduras, Fintrac designed its own field-based management information system to provide real-time feedback from field staff on individual clients. The system is used to track technical assistance delivered, follow-up actions required, impacts and results, training, and investments. From their mobile offices, CDA´s field agronomists and other technicians enter this information into a database using a laptop, and submit it via the Internet for posting on Fintrac´s intranet. In addition to a laptop, CDA technicians also typically have at their disposal a GPS device, which is used to map farm boundaries, topography, and irrigation systems, as well as digital cameras, portable printers, cell phones, portable weather stations, and floppy disk drives. ´Technology is an important part of our work,´ <b>says</b> <b>Andrew</b> Medlicott, Fintrac´s Latin American Director. ´The information technology we use captures almost all of the activities and results in the field, based on which we can generate reports and data. The growers see the difference with the immediate delivery of analyses and recommendations. In most technical assistance programmes field staff record information and deliver it a week later after returning to their office. But a week is a long time in agriculture - it can mean the difference between profit and loss´. Fintrac has taken these ICT innovations and improved on them. In September 2003 the company launched new proprietary software, called the Client Impact and Results Information System (CIRIS), which has been designed specifically for agribusiness development programmes. The system´s reporting capabilities will enable an improved level of technical communication between Fintrac staff throughout Honduras and elsewhere. At the client level, not only will field technicians be able to access individual client data and follow-up technical assistance requirements, as is currently the case, they will also be able to view recommendations made by other field staff on a crop-specific basis across the world. With CIRIS, all Fintrac laptops will have fully replicated versions of the master database, so that field staff do not need to be online. This is critical if they are based in remote areas with only sporadic access to the Internet. On the programme management side, Fintrac project and home office supervisors, as well as donor staff, can access real-time reports online through the programme´s intranet. Along with extensive use of ICTs, Fintrac stresses the application of the latest and most affordable agricultural field technology. CDA technicians utilize basic agronomic equipment to assist growers in improving their production systems and in problem solving. It is the combination of effective ICTs along with the latest field equipment and production methods that have contributed to the success of the programme for the benefit of Honduran smallholder farmers. mailto:charlie@fintrac. com Charles Mahoney is a market analyst with the Fintrac CDA programme in Honduras.

40|$|Data {{from the}} 2003 Australian Survey of Social Attitudes shows {{strong support for}} member-owned organisations, <b>says</b> <b>Andrew</b> Passey The 2003 Australian Survey of Social Attitudes {{is the first of}} a new series of {{biennial}} surveys managed by the ACSPRI Centre for Social Research in the Research School of Social Sciences at the ANU. Developed with the cooperation of social scientists around Australia, AuSSA provides data on the social attitudes and behaviour of Australians. It is a mail survey that gathers opinions from approximately 5, 000 Australians aged 18 or above who are selected randomly from the AEC’s Electoral Roll. The Australian Centre for Cooperative Research and Development (ACCORD) contributed a set of 27 questions to the survey, asking respondents about their attitudes to cooperatives, to the demutualisation of member-owned organisations, and about their membership of associations. The ACCORD questions asked respondents to choose between cooperatives/mutuals, government and business as the best providers of a range of different services. With the exception of telephone and internet services, the proportion choosing cooperatives/mutuals was second each time (usually to business). For example, 32 per cent of respondents chose cooperatives/mutuals as the best providers of banking services and 25 per cent for insurance services. Twenty-two percent saw them as the best providers of food retailing. These are surprisingly high figures given the emphasis on the shareholding market economy in Australia. People clearly want a choice of service provider, and the survey shows that many prefer organisations that are owned by the members, and where they have a greater say in the way their organisation is run, rather than simply being a taxpayer or shareholder. But cooperatives are not purely economic entities - they have important social impacts too. One in three Australians is, or has been, a member of a cooperative, and the Australian public is broadly supportive of the economic and social work that cooperatives do. The findings are supported by broader attitudes to cooperatives in Australia, which reveal that these kinds of organisation are seen by the public to embody important values. Almost 72 per cent of Australians agree that cooperatives show people can still work together, and 65 per cent feel that cooperatives do good work. One way they do so is evident from the survey findings, with six in ten respondents agreeing that cooperatives help make the market place fairer. This last finding is revealing - it suggests that cooperatives might be a solution to broadly reported concerns about the economic insecurities and sense of powerlessness associated with being a citizen of a market economy. What then about the social impacts of cooperatives? As member owned and democratically run organisations based on principles of mutualism, they have a number of relational as well as material outcomes. Ask members of cooperatives if they think people can be trusted and 49 per cent will say yes (compared with only 42 per cent of all Australians and 38 per cent of non-members). If you ask them about political trust, 10 per cent more cooperative members will have confidence in Federal parliament than Australians at large. Perhaps unsurprisingly, cooperative members are more likely to favour cooperative service providers than non-members, partly since they know such options exist, and because they have direct (and positive) experiences of their activities. But, it seems there is support for the mutual form of organisation across the population, despite the high profile flotation of mutual organisations such as the AMP and NRMA Insurance. When asked if they agreed or disagreed that changing ownership from members to shareholders was a mistake for these organisations, almost half (49 per cent) agreed it had been a mistake. In contrast, only 19 per cent disagreed. Interestingly, this is despite the windfalls that many have received on the back of privatisations, and the alleged benefits to individuals as the newly fledged customers of such organisations. Support for the economic and social objectives of cooperatives, which are embedded in the cooperative principles that guide their organisational behaviour, are evident from these survey findings. Despite adding complexity to the management and governance of cooperatives, it seems that the Australian public is aware of the multi-faceted nature and goals of such organisations. In essence, they are broadly supportive of cooperatives working as service providers in the mixed economy and bringing with them important values. Even in these days of the hegemony of the market (supported by the operations of the state) member owned and run organisations have a role in the nation’s economic and social development.

40|$|Diversity and {{a generous}} welfare system don’t {{necessarily}} mix, <b>says</b> <b>Andrew</b> Leigh. So the case for redistribution needs to be argued frequently and forcefully WHY do some countries look after the poor better than others? Why is America more unequal than Europe, and less generous to its most disadvantaged citizens? How does Australia’s welfare generosity compare? And what does the future hold for today’s social welfare state? In a new book, Fighting Poverty in the US and Europe: A World of Difference (Oxford University Press), two economists from Harvard University, Alberto Alesina and Ed Glaeser, explore why the American and European welfare systems are so different from one another. To Alesina, an Italian, and Glaeser, {{who grew up in}} New York, {{the question is not whether}} the US or European system is preferable, but why there is such a disparity between the two. Many an Australian tourist, sporting a round-the-world ticket, will have had the opportunity to compare poverty in the US and Europe first hand. Spend a few hours on the streets of any major US city, and the nation’s stingy social welfare spending quickly apparent. Overall, America spends 15 per cent of national income on social programs, compared with 25 per cent in Europe. When a US worker without children loses his job, he typically receives six months of unemployment insurance. After that, many will be entitled to nothing more than food stamps. In Europe, poverty rates are visibly lower, with high minimum wages, universal healthcare, redistributive pension plans and strongly progressive taxes being the norm. Perhaps purely economic explanations can account for these differences? After delving into their economic toolbox for a straightforward solution, Alesina and Glaeser think not. America has more earnings inequality than Europe, but the duo find little evidence that market inequality is actually a cause of America’s smaller welfare state. They are similarly sceptical that the efficiency of the tax system can explain much of the trans-Atlantic difference in tax and welfare policies. Another common economic explanation is that America doesn’t need a generous welfare state because it is a more fluid society than most European countries. If the poor of today will be the rich of tomorrow, why worry about redistributing income? Carefully analysing the evidence, Alesina and Glaeser find no support for the notion that income mobility in America is substantially higher than in Europe. Americans are much more likely than Europeans to believe that the poor have a good chance of escaping poverty than the rich - but these attitudinal differences are not a reflection of the underlying realities. So what does account for the differences in social welfare spending between the US and Europe? At the end of an exhaustive analysis, Alesina and Glaeser settle upon two explanations - voting systems and racial diversity. Voting systems affect redistribution by changing the incentives of politicians. In majoritarian systems, where each politician represents a single electorate (as in the US and Australian House of Representatives), politicians’ main incentive is to look after the interests of their local areas. This kind of geographic pork-barrelling is rarely aimed at helping the rich or poor, but at boosting the interests of one region’s residents over the rest of the country. By contrast, under systems of proportional representation (as in many European countries and New Zealand), several politicians represent the same district. This leads to a different incentive - rather than aligning themselves with a region, politicians tend to develop class-based affiliations, increasing the pressures for universal programs, which often redistribute resources from rich to poor. Alesina and Glaeser show that across countries, proportional representation leads to more social spending, and more income redistribution. Why do more European countries have proportional representation? In the first two decades of the twentieth century (and particularly the years following the first world war), most of Europe adopted constitutional systems that provided for proportional representation. Typically, the push for proportional representation was spearheaded by the socialist movement. They found their task simpler in countries that were more left-wing at the time of their transition to democracy, in geographically smaller countries (where strikes could more easily threaten the main cities), and in countries that had suffered war on their own soil. America has none of these features - it is an old democracy on a large land mass which, after 1865, never suffered the ravages of war on its own soil. Comparing across countries, the authors conclude that differences in voting systems explain about half the difference in social spending between the US and Europe. What explains the other half of the gap? Here, Alesina and Glaeser are sure to court controversy. After careful scrutiny of the evidence, they conclude that the remaining difference in welfare spending between the US and Europe can be explained by the fact that the US is more racially diverse. A variety of studies on prejudice have shown that people tend to be hostile to those who are different from them along some salient dimension. Often, the most important dimension is race or ethnicity. In the US, a quarter of the population is African-American or Hispanic. In Sweden, 95 per cent of the population are of the same race, ethnicity and religion. The potential to exploit racial antipathy will therefore be considerably greater in the US than Europe. That racial diversity is an obstacle to forging a common coalition around distribution from rich to poor has often been noted. Writing in the nineteenth century, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels anticipated that America’s ethnic divisions would impede the growth of a US socialist movement. During the first half of the twentieth century, while Europeans harnessed the power of the state to build a nascent welfare system, racial politics in the American south was blocking redistribution. And when Democratic President Lyndon Johnson finally implemented civil rights reforms in the 1960 s, the result was to hand political control of the south to the Republican Party. Race and redistribution are powerfully linked. Alesina and Glaeser show that US states that are more ethnically diverse tend to have more negative attitudes towards welfare, and lower levels of social welfare spending. The same pattern holds internationally - countries with more racial and ethnic heterogeneity also tend to spend less on welfare programs. The simplest interpretation of this finding is that people are less generous to those who are different from them, but Alesina and Glaeser also highlight another factor: politicians who use racial hatred to discredit redistributive policies. Barry Goldwater, Pat Buchanan, Joerg Haider, Jean-Marie LePen and Pauline Hanson have all used hatred against racial minorities as a way of building an anti-redistribution constituency. But wait. Couldn’t it be that Americans are simply more conservative than Europeans? After all, surveys show that Kerry would have beaten Bush had the pair been running in virtually any other developed country (the exceptions are Russia and Israel). The average American is more individualistic than the average European, more hostile towards welfare, more likely to agree that the poor are lazy, and less likely to think that poverty is society’s fault. Alesina and Glaeser argue that these cultural attitudes are not first-order explanations, but products of political indoctrination: ‘American beliefs about the poor should be seen as the result, not the cause, of successful American anti-redistribution politicians. European beliefs are the direct result of the dominance of European socialism’. The notion of America as the land of opportunity, and the prevalent class-consciousness in many European nations have little to do with underlying realities - after all, income mobility is similar in the US and Europe. Attitudes about welfare are not inherent, but largely driven by structural factors: proportional representation voting systems in most European countries, and ethnic diversity in the US. At this point, I might highlight the only real quibble that I had with Fighting Poverty in the US and Europe - the book gives short shrift to the way in which religion in America has diverted attention away from redistribution. Evangelical churches, which care little for income redistribution, have expanded rapidly in the US over recent decades. According to a 2002 Pew Global Attitudes Survey, 59 per cent of Americans believe that religion is very important to them, compared with 27 per cent of Italians, 21 per cent of Germans and 11 per cent of French people (the survey was not conducted in Australia). In focusing voters’ attention on religious issues - such as abortion and gay marriage - evangelical church leaders effectively redirect voters’ concerns away from redistribution. Can Alesina and Glaeser’s theory explain Australia’s attitudes and policies towards welfare and progressive taxation? To check this, I went back to the same surveys that Alesina and Glaeser use for the US and Europe, and calculated the results for Australia. On a range of indicators, Australians’ attitudes towards poverty seem to be closer to the US than Europe. Asked whether the poor are trapped in poverty - and hence presumably deserving of welfare - only 39 per cent of Australians agree, much closer to the US (29 per cent) than Europe (60 per cent). Another question that would tend to favour redistribution is whether luck determines income. Just 40 per cent of Australians agree, slightly above the US (30 per cent), but well below Europe (54 per cent). Asked whether the poor are lazy, nearly half (49 per cent) of Australians agree, again much closer to the US (60 per cent) than Europe (26 per cent). Consistent with these views, Australia’s welfare system is closer to the US. Our social welfare spending comprises 18 per cent of national income, considerably closer to that of the US (15 per cent) than Europe (25 per cent). In policy terms, Australia is sometimes said to be in the mid-Atlantic. Evidently, we are nearer the Statue of Liberty than the canals of Amsterdam. Australia’s politics are more similar to the US system than to most of Europe, with our House of Representatives elected by majoritarian voting, and our Senate elected by proportional representation. And as with the US, three factors help explain why the Australian House of Representatives is not elected by proportional representation. First, while our constitution is not as old as America’s, our transition to democracy nonetheless preceded that of many European countries. Second, our sprawling land mass has always impeded labour uprisings - particularly in the early years of the twentieth century, when a higher fraction of the population lived in rural areas. And third, the world wars of the twentieth century were fought, for the most part, well away from our shores. But the wars did have some effect on Australia’s electoral system. Australia adopted a ‘multiple majority-preferential’ system for the Senate in the wake of the first world war, and adopted the current ‘quota-preferential proportional representation’ system immediately after the second world war. Alesina and Glaeser’s theory also helps us understand why proportional representation prevails only in the two smallest regions of Australia: Tasmania (which adopted PR throughout the state in 1907) and the Australian Capital Territory (the most left-wing state or territory in Australia, which adopted PR in 1995). It seems unlikely that Australia will ever follow New Zealand, which in 1993 adopted proportional representation for its lower house. Yet there is one important respect in which the Australian constitution is more pro-redistribution than most other countries. Compulsory voting ensures that the poor are not underrepresented in the voting booths, as occurs in nations with voluntary voting. So our mostly majoritarian voting system seems to help understand why Australia is anti-redistribution. What about racial and ethnic diversity? A useful measure of diversity is the fractionalization index, which varies from 0 (a society that is perfectly homogenous) to 1 (a society with an infinite number of tiny groups). On a measure of ethnic fractionalization, Australia (0. 09) is lower than both Europe (0. 19) and the US (0. 49). But in terms of linguistic diversity, Australia (0. 33) is higher than both Europe (0. 23) and the US (0. 25). According to the model put forward by Alesina and Glaeser, our high level of linguistic diversity helps explain Australia’s relatively small social welfare sector. Another way of looking at the question is to compare more ethnically diverse Australian suburbs with less diverse suburbs, holding constant other factors such as income. Here, the general pattern is the opposite to that found in the US. Across Australia, people in more ethnic or linguistic diverse suburbs are more likely to agree that ‘income and wealth should be redistributed’. The exception is Queensland, where the US pattern holds - those in more diverse suburbs tend to oppose redistribution. This probably reflects the fact that in recent years, racially driven politics has been stronger in Queensland than in any other state (in 1998, One Nation held one-eighth of the seats in the Queensland Parliament). It is possible that the same pattern also holds in the Northern Territory, but the sample was too small to test this. Finally, what does Alesina and Glaeser’s paper predict about the future? It is unlikely that the US, Europe or Australia will witness major changes to their voting systems, meaning that proportional representation in Europe will keep most European welfare systems more generous than that of the US and Australia. But something else that is likely to change is racial and ethnic diversity. Strong pressures for immigration from developing countries make it likely that rich nations will become more ethnically diverse. At the end of the second world war, 10 per cent of Australian residents were born overseas (2 per cent in a non-English speaking country). In the most recent census, 23 per cent of Australians were born overseas (15 per cent in a non-English speaking country). Diversity enriches Australia in many ways. From a pure economic standpoint, it supplements our labour market with much-needed skills. And thanks to our immigration points system, several studies have found no evidence that immigration increases the unemployment rate in Australia. In a deeper sense, immigration is valuable because it weaves new threads into our cultural tapestry. Native-born children have much to learn from their migrant peers, just as adults can gain a deeper understanding of the world from yarning over the back fence with their foreign-born neighbours. And our restaurants would be bland imitations of themselves without the flavours brought by successive waves of Italian, Thai and Vietnamese immigrants. But we should not gild the lily. Immigration is also likely to create the opportunity for anti-welfare politicians to build a constituency against redistribution. The rise of the One Nation Party was not a unique Australian phenomenon, but the same sort of anti-minority, anti-welfare demagoguery that has worked well in the US, and is now increasingly emerging in Europe. As Alesina and Glaeser’s provocative book shows, there is a tension between high immigration and the maintenance of a redistributive welfare system. Those who support both may well find that unless the case for redistribution is made frequently and forcefully, rising diversity may start to undermine the welfare state. • Andrew Leigh is an economist in the Research School of Social Sciences at the Australian National University.
