40|$|The {{smoothing}} of polyhedral surfaces {{is important}} for the analysis and visualization of three-dimensional medical images. Simple Gaussian <b>surface</b> <b>smoothing</b> has a wellknown drawback of causing surface shrinkage. This has led to various signal processing algorithms for surface mesh filtering. In this paper, a new approach to surface mesh smoothing without shrinkage is presented. The approach is based on a representation of sphere shaped simplex meshes. The <b>surface</b> <b>smoothing</b> is formulated as a quadratic optimization problem, which is shown to be uniquely solvable. The cost function to be optimized penalizes deviations from the sphere shape while maintaining the overall shape of the original mesh. A linear time gradient descent algorithm for solving the optimization problem is derived. The <b>surface</b> <b>smoothing</b> achieved this way is fast, simple, reversible, and does not cause surface shrinkage. We demonstrate good properties of the algorithm by filtering synthetic surfaces as well as surfaces extracted from three-dimensional medical images. In addition, quantitative comparisons to competing algorithms are made. These further illustrate the advantages of the proposed sphere filtering algorithm...|$|E

Laplacian operator is performed in a global way over the mesh. The <b>surface</b> <b>smoothing</b> is formulated as a quadratic optimization problem, which is easily solved by a sparse linear system. The cost function to be optimized penalizes deviations from the global Laplacian operator while maintaining the overall shape of the original mesh. The features of the original mesh can be preserved by adding feature constraints and barycenter constraints in the system. Our approach is simple and fast, and does not cause surface shrinkage and distortion. Many experimental results are presented to show the applicability and flexibility of the approach...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{approach}} for smoothing surfaces represented by triangular meshes. The proposed method is a two-step procedure: surface normal smoothing through fuzzy vector median (FVM) filtering followed by vertex position update based on the least square error criteria. This paper applies the fuzzy ordering theory to the vector based data and introduces the fuzzy vector median. The application of FVM filters to surface normal smoothing yields improved results over previously introduced normal smoothing algorithms. The improved filtering results, coupled with LSE vertex position update, produces <b>surface</b> <b>smoothing</b> that minimizes the effects of noise while simultaneously preserving detail features. Simulation results are presented showing {{the performance of the}} proposed method and its advantages over commonly used <b>surface</b> <b>smoothing</b> algorithms.

Although 2 D image processing-based edge detection techniques have been popular in many application areas, they are not well developed for surfaces represented by triangle meshes. This paper proposes a robust edge detection algorithm for triangle meshes and its applications to surface segmentation and adaptive <b>surface</b> <b>smoothing.</b> The proposed edge detection technique is based on eigen analysis of the surface normal vector field in a geodesic window. To compute the edge strength of a certain vertex, the neighboring vertices in a specified geodesic distance are involved. Edge information are used further to segment the surfaces with watershed algorithm and to achieve edgepreserved, adaptive <b>surface</b> <b>smoothing.</b> The proposed algorithm is novel in robustly detecting edges on triangle meshes against noise. The 3 D watershed algorithm is an extension from previous work. Experimental results on surfaces reconstructed from multi-view real range images are presented...|$|E
