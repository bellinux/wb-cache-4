5|$|Thermoremanent {{magnetization}} is {{the main}} source of the magnetic anomalies around ocean ridges. As the seafloor spreads, magma wells up from the mantle, cools to form new basaltic crust {{on both sides of the}} ridge, and is carried away from it by seafloor spreading. As it cools, it records the direction of the Earth's field. When the Earth's field reverses, new basalt records the reversed direction. The result is a series of stripes that are symmetric about the ridge. A ship towing a magnetometer on the surface of the ocean can detect these stripes and infer the age of the ocean floor below. This provides information on the rate at which seafloor has <b>spread</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past.|$|E

40|$|Attachment of HeLa {{cells to}} gelatin induces {{the release of}} arachidonic acid (AA), which is {{essential}} for cell spreading. HeLa cells <b>spreading</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of extracellular Ca 21 released more AA and formed more distinctive lamellipodia and filopodia than cells <b>spreading</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence of Ca 21. Addition of exogenous AA to cells <b>spreading</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence of extracellular Ca 21 restored the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia. To investigate the role of cytosolic phospholipase A 2 (cPLA 2) <b>in</b> regulating <b>the</b> differential release of AA and subsequent formation of lamellipodia and filopodia during HeLa cell adhesion, cPLA 2 phosphorylation and transloca-tion from the cytosol to the membrane were evaluated. During HeLa cell attachment and <b>spreading</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of Ca 21, all cPLA 2 became phosphorylated within 2 min, which is the earliest time cell attachment could be measured. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> absence of extracellular Ca 21, the time for complete cPLA 2 phosphorylation was lengthened to, 4 min. Maximal translocation of cPLA 2 from cytosol to membrane during adhesion of cells to gelatin was similar <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{presence or absence of}} extracellular Ca 21 and remained membrane associated throughout the duration of cell spreading.

5|$|While the Apostolic Faith Mission {{was founded}} in 1908 and Pentecostalism brought to South Africa by American missionaries, several factors helped create a {{favorable}} climate for the Pentecostal movement to <b>spread</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country. First, revivals in the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (DRC) in 1860, 1874 and 1884 were characterized by deep conviction of sin followed by conversion, fervent prayer and some ecstatic phenomenon. Thus in 1908, some older DRC members were familiar and open to Pentecostalism. Second, the Dutch Reformed minister Andrew Murray was a prominent holiness teacher and helped create a climate for revival. A third factor was the Zionist churches, led by John Alexander Dowie from Zion City, Illinois, United States.|$|E
5|$|Anjaana Anjaani {{film was}} {{initially}} slated to release on 24 September 2010. It was postponed by one week, {{just four days}} before the expected date because this would coincide with the controversial Ayodhya dispute verdict, which many anticipated would be disputed and cause chaos in the country. Trade experts were against postponing the film, and questioned Nadiadwala's decision, as the government had already taken precautionary measures with the Commonwealth Games around the corner. They also felt that the postponement would send mixed signals and confuse viewers as the promotional campaign centred around the 25 September release. Additionally, the film would lose the advantage of being the only new release. Changing the release date would mean Anjaana Anjaani would clash with the science fiction film Enthiran, which might affect the film's box-office performance. Still, the film was postponed to 1 October 2010. Later, the Ayodhya verdict was itself postponed to three days before the film's new release date. Industry insiders started speculating again about the film's release being postponed by another week, causing rumours to <b>spread</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> media. However, Sajid Nadiadwla confirmed that the news was false and the film was releasing on 1 October 2010.|$|E

Obituaries were published in daily newspapers The Manchester Guardian, The Times and The Daily Telegraph and in construction industry periodicals including The Builder, Architectural Review, Journal of the Royal Institute of British Architects and Journal of the Town Planning Institute. Generally, the obituaries were positive about Holden's early work and the stations for London Underground, were neutral about Senate House and were negative about his practice's later works. The Harmer Green house {{and most of its}} contents were auctioned with the proceeds left to family members. Holden also left £8,400 to friends and staff and £2,000 to charity.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the {{province}} is centered around the Chewa people who {{under the rule of}} Kalonga Gawa Undi established a vast empire extending to modern day Central Malawi and the northeastern part of Tete Province in Mozambique. The chieftains of the empire exercised control over the territory in modern times. The most notable of them was Kalonga Gawa Undi X, whose regime started in 1954. By 1957, he joined Harry Mwaanga Nkumbula's political party that supported the British Colonial Empire. By the time he completed his European tour and returned to his province, nationalism had almost <b>spread</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> entire province. To avoid uprising, periodic fatalities and loyalty he enjoyed among masses, he supported the nationalist movement. After the independence of Zambia, during the 1960s, some of the districts in the province had unprecedented growth in infrastructure and agriculture. However, the growth of the province was terminated along with that of the country due falling copper prices.|$|E
5|$|The {{exhibition}} {{opened on}} July 9, 1962, with Warhol absent. The thirty-two single soup can canvases {{were placed in}} a single line, much like products on shelves, each displayed on narrow individual ledges. The contemporary impact was uneventful, but the historical impact is considered today {{to have been a}} watershed. The gallery audience was unsure what to make of the exhibit. A John Coplans Artforum article, which was in part spurred on by the responding display of dozens of soup cans by a nearby gallery with a display advertising them at three for 60 cents, encouraged people to take a stand on Warhol. Few actually saw the paintings at the Los Angeles exhibit or at Warhol's studio, but word <b>spread</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of controversy and scandal due to the work's seeming attempt to replicate the appearance of manufactured objects. Extended debate on the merits and ethics of focusing one's efforts on such a mundane commercial inanimate model kept Warhol's work in art world conversations. The pundits could not believe an artist would reduce the art form to the equivalent of a trip to the local grocery store. Talk did not translate into monetary success for Warhol. Dennis Hopper was the first of only a half dozen to pay $100 for a canvas. Blum decided to try to keep the thirty-two canvases as an intact set and bought back the few sales. This pleased Warhol who had conceived of them as a set, and he agreed to sell the set for ten monthly $100 installments to Blum. Warhol had passed the milestone of his first serious art show. While this exhibition was on view in Los Angeles, Martha Jackson canceled another planned December 1962 New York exhibition.|$|E
