40|$|Gas {{exchange}} {{is essential for}} multicellular organisms. In contrast to the circulatory systems of animals, land plants have tissues with intercellular spaces (ICSs), called aerenchyma, that are critical for efficient gas exchange. Plants form ICSs by two different mechanisms: schizogeny, where localized cell separation creates spaces; and lysogeny, where cells die to create intercellular spaces. In <b>schizogenous</b> ICS formation, specific molecular mechanisms regulate the sites of cell separation and coordinate extensive reorganization of cell walls. Emerging evidence suggests the involvement of extracellular signaling, mediated by peptide ligands and leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases, in the regulation of cell wall remodeling during cell separation. Recent work on the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha has demonstrated a critical role for a plasma membrane-associated plant U-box E 3 ubiquitin ligase in ICS formation. In this review, I discuss the mechanism of <b>schizogenous</b> ICS formation, focusing on the potential role of extracellular signaling in the regulation of cell separation...|$|E

Differences in seed {{microstructure}} between popping and conventional (non-popping) bean genotypes conceivably contribute to popping in ñuñas. However, the microstructural characteristics which {{contribute to the}} popping attribute and sites of expansion have not been identified. Seeds and excised cotyledons of unpopped and popped ñuñas were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Protoplasts of unpopped ñuñas were similar to protoplasts of conventional beans. Intercellular spaces of unpopped ñuñas were occuled by <b>schizogenous</b> cell walls. The occluded form of intercellular spaces differed distinctively from the open form in popped ñuñas and untreated conventional beans. The expansion of cotyledon mesophyll in popped ñuñas came primarily from expansion of cell walls and secondarily by expansion of the intercellular spaces. Cell wall thickness and dimensions of protoplasts were not changed during popping. Expansion of cell walls away from protoplasts created intracellular voids. SEM images indicated that starch granules (grains) in popped ñuñas were generally not altered by popping.

40|$|Background Ugni molinae Turcz. {{is one of}} {{the most}} studied species of South American Myrtaceae due to its edible fruits and foliar {{medicinal}} compounds. However, there is no anatomical study of the leaves or secretory cavities. This paper seeks to describe the leaf micromorphology and anatomy of the species using standard protocols for light and scanning electron microscopy. Secretory cavities were anatomically characterized in young and mature leaves. Histochemical staining of the cavities was performed. Results The leaves of U. molinae are hypostomatic, have a wavy surface and possess scattered hairs. Leaf anatomical features include dorsiventral mesophyll, two to three layers of palisade parenchyma with abundant chloroplasts, calcium oxalate crystals and internal phloem in vascular bundles. <b>Schizogenous</b> secretory cavities are present on the abaxial surface and are mainly located on the margins of the leaves. Histochemical tests of these cavities suggest the presence of lipophilic substances. Conclusions This is the first study of secretory cavities in Chilean Myrtaceae.

40|$|Sago palm (Metroxylon sagu Rottb.), which {{produces}} starch {{in large quantities}} in its trunk, could {{become one of the}} most important nutritious food resources in the near future. Although its root functions are thought to be very important for the enormous shoot growth, the morphological and anatomical studies are limited. This study investigates external and internal structures of sago roots with reference to their functions to distinguish two types of roots in each plant; i. e., large (about 6 - 11 mm diameter) and small (about 4 - 6 mm diameter) roots. Large roots were adventitious roots whose primordia were formed just inside the epidermis in the stem, emerged from the trunk surface and grew downward into the soil. Small roots were lateral roots whose primordia were formed on large roots running horizontally or on other small roots, grew not only downward and obliquely in both deep peat and mineral soils, but also right above in deep peat soils. Anatomical observations revealed that both large and small roots had the same internal structures containing epidermis, exodermis, suberized sclerenchyma. cells, cortex and stele, with only differences in their sizes or cell numbers. Both roots had characteristic development of <b>schizogenous</b> or lysigenous aerenchyma, but seem to have different functions. Root primordia were formed successively throughout the trunk.

40|$|A 3 D virtual fruit tissue {{generator}} {{is presented}} that can distinctly define the microstructural {{components of a}} fruit tissue {{and that can be}} used to model important physical processes such as gas transport during controlled atmosphere storage. The model is based on the biomechanics of plant cells in tissues. The main merit of this algorithm is that it can account for typical differences in intercellular air space networks and in cell size and shape found between different fruit species and tissues. The cell is considered as a closed thin walled structure, maintained in tension by turgor pressure. The cell walls of adjacent cells are modeled as parallel, linear elastic elements which obey Hooke's law. A 3 D Voronoi tessellation is used to generate the initial topology of the cells. Intercellular air spaces of <b>schizogenous</b> origin are generated by separating the Voronoi cells along the edges where three Voronoi cells are in contact; while intercellular air spaces of lysigenous origin are generated by deleting (killing) some of the Voronoi cells randomly. Cell expansion then results from turgor pressure acting on the yielding cell wall material. To find the sequence of positions of each vertex and thus the shape of the tissue with time, a system of differential equations for the positions and velocities of each vertex is established and solved using a Matlab ordinary differential equation solver. Statistical comparison with synchrotron tomography images of fruit tissue is excellent.

40|$|Varzeas are species-rich forest {{communities}} of the Central Amazon floodplains, inhabited by highly adapted tree species that can withstand long flooding periods. The leaf shedding behaviour and morphological traits that may contribute to adaptation to low oxygen levels were studied at the Ilha de Marchantaria on the lower Solimoes-Amazonas river, Brazil, and in greenhouse experiments with cuttings of six tree species typical of the Amazon floodplain. Comparison of deciduousness in situ revealed that four of the species under investigation, Salix martiana, Tabernaemontana juruana, Laetia corymbulosa and Pouteria glomerata, are able to maintain their leaf system during the aquatic period. Adventitious roots were formed by S. martiana and T. juruana, but anatomical characteristics differed between the species. Whereas S. martiana developed lysigenous aerenchyma in its roots during aerobic and anaerobic growth, only small intercellular spaces of <b>schizogenous</b> origin were formed in the root cortex of T juruana. Similar to the latter species, such spaces were constitutively formed in the deciduous species Crateva benthami and Vitex cymosa. Suberin deposits were observed in tangential and radial cell walls of the hypodermis of roots from T juruana, L. corymbuloso and P. glomerata. Suberin deposits were less pronounced in roots of S. martiana and absent in V. cymosa and C. benthami. The data show that different, almost contrasting, survival mechanisms have evolved in roots of plants with similar life forms in the same habitat.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to know the primary structure and intercellular space formation of feeding root in Sonneratia alba in order to relate their development and structure of their function as environmental adaptation in mangrove’s root. The conventional histological techniques by Light Microscopy (LM) were used to get anatomical datas. This root has no cork covering. Cells of the meristem normally had dense cytoplasm and clear nucleus. Protoderm first appeared as a distinct layer {{at the edge of the}} tiers of cortical meristem. Root caps of feeding root of S. alba consist of two regions, i. e., weakly stained central columella or statenchyma and well-stained peripheral regions. The columella has 8 - 11 layers. The size of gas spaces is 100 - 320 μm. All the cells in the cortex appear round in cross section. Between 0 - 500 μm distances from the tip, few intercellular spaces and cortical cells are tightly packed. At distance more than 500 μm from the tip, cortical cells began to separate each other and resulted in the intercellular spaces between longitudinal files of the cortical cells. Changes of cortex cells with developing gas spaces suggested that cell separation (<b>schizogenous)</b> and enlargement of intercellular spaces has occurred to form aerenchyma in these plants. From its shape, structure and location, it seems clear that the primary structures of root assists the root in penetrating the soil and absorbs nutrient.

The algorithm can account for typical differences in epidermal layers, palisade mesophyll layer and spongy mesophyll layer which have characteristic differences {{in the shape of}} cells, arrangement of cells and void fractions present in each layer. The cell is considered as a closed thin walled structure, maintained in tension by turgor pressure. The cell walls are modelled as linear elastic elements which obey Hooke's law. A Voronoi tessellation was used to generate the initial topology of the cells in the spongy mesophyll layer. Then two layers of brick structured cells are added to the top of it to represent the palisade mesophyll and upper epidermis and a single layer is added at bottom of the Voronoi tessellation to represent the lower epidermal layer. Intercellular air spaces are generated by separating the Voronoi cells along the edges starting from where three Voronoi cells are in contact (<b>schizogenous</b> origin) and/or by deleting some of the Voronoi cells (lysigenous origin). Cell expansion then results from turgor pressure acting on the yielding cell wall material. To find the sequence of positions of each vertex and thus the shape of the tissue with time, a system of differential equations for the positions and velocities of each vertex is established and solved using the ordinary differential equation solver in MatLab.

30|$|In {{contrast}} to the other ground tissues, the mesodermis is composed of four to five cell layers in the radicle, which will differentiate into a lysigenous–schizogenous aerenchyma with intercellular spaces that develop into large lacunae. First, during mesodermis differentiation, the cells become round and spaces between cells are generated. These intercellular spaces are called <b>schizogenous</b> spaces. Later, programmed cell death of mesodermal cells produces cellular spaces called lysigenous spaces. Lysogeny results in a typical radial morphology that includes strands of surviving cortical cells separated by gas spaces [23]. Aerenchyma {{is regarded as a}} tissue that is devoted to gas exchange from the shoot and acts as a reservoir of oxygen that is required for root respiration under flooding conditions. Development of the aerenchyma is observed in several aquatic plants species and can also be induced by submergence or anoxia in maize [87]. In comparison, aerenchyma formation is constitutive in rice, and cell death is assumed to represent a part of the developmental process. The aerenchyma is visible in all rice root types, excluding the small lateral roots that possess no mesodermis layer. Finally, the innermost cell layer of the ground tissue system is the endodermis. Endodermal cells contain the Casparian strip, which is made of suberin and surrounds the entire cell. The Casparian strip was more developed when the roots were grown in soil but remained poorly developed when the roots were fostered under hydroponic conditions. Endodermal cells represent a resistant apoplastic barrier to water and nutrition flow and are known to ensure selective transfer through cell symplasts between the mesodermis and the central cylinder (Fig.  3 b).|$|E

The growing epidemic, with its high morbidity and mortality {{points to the need}} for a protective vaccine against cytauxzoonosis. Unfortunately, the causative agent has yet to be cultured continuously in vitro, rendering traditional vaccine development approaches beyond reach. Here we report the use of comparative genomics to computationally and experimentally interpret the C. felis genome to identify a novel candidate vaccine antigen for cytauxzoonosis. As a starting point we sequenced, assembled, and annotated the C. felis genome and the proteins it encodes. Whole genome alignment revealed considerable conserved synteny with other apicomplexans. In particular, alignments with the bovine parasite Theileria parva revealed that a C. felis gene, cf 76, is syntenic to p 67 (the leading vaccine candidate for bovine theileriosis), despite a lack of significant sequence similarity. Recombinant subdomains of cf 76 were challenged with survivor-cat antiserum and found to be highly seroreactive. Comparison of eleven geographically diverse samples from the south-central and southeastern USA demonstrated 91 - 100 % amino acid sequence identity across cf 76, including a high level of conservation in an immunogenic 226 amino acid (24 kDa) carboxyl terminal domain. Using in situ hybridization, transcription of cf 76 was documented in the <b>schizogenous</b> stage of parasite replication, the life stage that {{is believed to be the}} most important for development of a protective immune response. Collectively, these data point to identification of the first potential vaccine candidate antigen for cytauxzoonosis.

Epithelial cells of S. dulcis and T. guianensis canals have rough endoplasmic reticulum, free ribosomes, elongated plastids of several shapes with osmiophilic inclusions and dictyosomes with production of vesicles. Such organelles participate in the secretion of a heterogeneous exudate, which is comprised of hydrophilic and lipophilic substances.

Floral composition is verysimple, especially in female flowers which consist only of single ovaries. Theaim {{of this study is}} to understand the development of Balanophora laxiflora inflorescence, its reduction of floral organs, and to provide more informationfor other studies on Balanophoraceae plants. We used the techniques for SEM,paraffin and plastic sectioning to conduct the investigations. Balanophora laxiflora is a dioecious plant. Both male and female inflorescence primordia develop in the <b>schizogenous</b> cavity of the tuber. After most floralorgans have differentiated and becomes emerged, the inflorescence bud breaksthrough the epidermal layers of the tuber. All floral organs of the inflorescenceare acropetally initiated. In the male inflorescence, leaf-like bracts are initiated prior to male flower primordia or simultaneously, followed by tepal primordia andstamen primordia, orderly. Stamens have numerous connate anthers on the androeciumreceptacle, but no filaments. The anther wall only has epidermis and tapetum differentiated. Microsporogenesis is similar to that of common flowering plants. Based on the analysis of variances, the numbers of tepals and anthers are highly variable among individuals. In the female inflorescence, numerous spadicles are initated first. They areconsidered as reduced bracts ontogeneticly. The female flower primordia aremainly initiated on the inflorescence axis.

The location and structure of secretory reservoirs in the stem were examined with the use of light microscopy in cup plant stems. The stems were analysed at various heights (0 - 2 cm above the root collar, ½ of the stem length, and 0 - 2 cm below the stem apex/inflorescence) and in three vegetation phases (vegetative phase, full bloom, withering). The plants belonged to the collection of the Department of Vegetable Crops and Medicinal Plants of the University of Life Sciences in Lublin. It was found that the secretory canals formed two rings: an external ring situated at the height of sclerenchymatous sheaths and bundle phloem, and the internal ring located in an immediate proximity of the xylem. Two external secretory reservoirs, one {{on each side of the}} bundle, were present at larger bundles. No internal reservoirs were formed in the proximity of these bundles. At smaller bundles, there were reservoirs of the internal verticil, but there were no external reservoirs. The canals of the external verticil (23 - 29) were more numerous that in the internal verticil (17 - 19). In both cases, the largest number of reservoirs was observed at half the length of the stem, and the lowest number was in the apical part. The less numerous internal canals were larger in comparison with the external reservoirs. Depending on the plant developmental stage and location in the stem, the diameter of the external ring canals was 49 - 91 μm in cross section, and that of the canals of the internal verticil was 52 - 101 μm. The analysis of the different vegetation phases in the cup plant demonstrated that the canals had the largest diameters and were the most abundant in the withering phase. The canals evolved through gradual separation of cells (of <b>schizogenous</b> origin). In the cross section they exhibited a nearly circular or oval shape; in the longitudinal section they formed long, continuous canals extending along the organ, i. e. they were ducts s. str.

40|$|When soil is flooded, the {{rhizosphere}} quickly reaches oxygen shortage conditions {{because of}} oxygen consumption {{during the early}} stages of flooding, not only by plant roots but also by soil micro-organisms. Although this environment is generally disadvantageous to plant growth, hygrophytes and some mesophytes can adapt to these conditions. In these plants, aerenchyma (tissue with much enlarged gas space) develops in the petioles, stems and roots, and enhances transport of atmospheric and photosynthetic oxygen to flooded tissues, thereby preventing serious damage to root organs (Armstrong, 1979; Dacey, 1980; Drew et al., 1985; Drew, 1997). On the other hand, many mesophytes have little ability to develop aerenchyma so, if the soil becomes flooded, their roots may become oxygen starved and damaged (Smirnoff and Crawford, 1983; Justin and Armstrong, 1987; Laan et al., 1989). Therefore, aerenchyma formation is thought {{to be one of the}} important morphological adaptations to hypoxic stress. Two main types of cortical aerenchyma in stems and roots can be distinguished by their process of formation: lysigenous and <b>schizogenous</b> aerenchyma (Jackson and Armstrong, 1999; Evans, 2003; Visser and Voesenek, 2004; Seago et al., 2005). The former is created through cell disintegration (death) in the primary cortex of adventitious roots, as in rice (Justin and Armstrong, 1991), maize (Drew et al., 1979, 1981) and wheat (Huang et al., 1997), whereas the latter is formed by the separation of cells from each other, often accompanied by cell divisions and normal expansion as in Rumex species (Laan et al., 1989; Jackson and Armstrong, 1999; Colmer et al., 2004). The anatomical and morphological formation of both types has been reported in detail. In particular, much research has been done on the regulation of lysigenous aerenchyma formation using the roots of maize (Drew, 1997; Gunawardena et al., 2001) and rice (Kawai et al., 1998). However, another type of cortical aerenchyma was described in roots of Jussiaea (now Ludwigia) species by Martins (1866) and Schenck (1889). 100 years ago. Some Ludwigia species have pneumatophores (respiratory roots) that grow vertically upward and emerge above the water surface as in mangrove plants (Hartsema, 1927; Sculthorpe, 1967). The intercellular gas spaces are produced by radial elongation of living, thin-walled primary cortical cells. These aerenchymatous tissues are composed of a regular meshwork of rectangular spaces, and are produced in concentric layers in transverse sections of the roots (Martins, 1866; Schenck, 1889; Ellmore, 1981). The elongated cells appear T-shaped in longitudinal sections (Haberlandt, 1914). Although the variation is different from that of Ludwigia, recently intercellular gas space shave been shown to be produced by primary cortical cell elongation in adventitious roots of the wetland plant Pontederia cordata (Seago et al., 2000) and is termed ‘expansigenous aerenchyma’ by Seago et al. (2005). Sponge gourd (Luffa cylindrica, Cucurbitaceae) is an annual vegetable upland crop that originates in India and southern Asia, and is distributed mainly in tropical to warm-temperate areas. Compared with bitter melon (Momordica charantia), this species is flood tolerant, but its morphological changes in response to flooding stress have not been examined (Liao and Lin, 1996). In Taiwan, yield of bitter melon is increased by grafting with Luffa spp., which allows bitter melon to survive in flooded soils (Palada and Chang, 2003). In sponge gourd, it was found that the primary cortical tissues of newly formed adventitious roots under flooding created an aerenchyma that was neither <b>schizogenous</b> nor lysigenous, but took the form of elongated cortical aerenchyma. This aerenchyma is composed of cells that appear T-shaped in longitudinal sections. According to Jost (1887), intercellular gas spaces are created by T-shaped cells in roots of Luffa amara (now L. acutangulus). T-shaped cells that are secondary tissues derived from a phellogen are also observed in flooded stems of Ludwigia (Schenck, 1889, see the English text in Arber, 1920), and the lacunate tissues seem to be similar to elongated primary cortical aerenchyma. However, the origin of the lacunate tissues in the stem of Ludwigia is strikingly different from that of aerenchyma observed in sponge gourd. Recently, morphological observations of T-shaped cells derived from a phellogen were reported in the root and stem of Decodon species (Little and Stockey, 2003, 2006) and Lythrum salicaria (Stevens et al., 1997), but there was no detailed observation of T-shaped cells derived from primary cortical cells. Ellmore (1981) described elongated cortical aerenchyma in mature pneumatophores of Ludwigia, but did not report how lacunae were created at an early stage; therefore, an investigation has been carried out to determine the developmental processes of this type of aerenchyma. In addition, it was found that such tissues were composed of radially elongated primary cortical cells in flooded hypocotyl of sponge gourd, but not of T-shaped cells. Here, the morphological changes in flooded tissues and the pattern of cortical aerenchyma formation are described for sponge gourd, and the relative amount of aerenchyma is analysed...|$|E
40|$|Aerenchyma is {{generally}} {{defined as a}} specialised plant tissue containing large intercellular air spaces. It is mostly renowned {{for its ability to}} increase gas conductance of those plant parts in which it occurs. Although aerenchyma is a typical feature of many wetland species worldwide, it can also be found in other plants among which many Bromeliaceae. In mature Guzmania plants the aerenchyma consists of a network of openly arranged stellate cells, creating large intercellular spaces, traversing the whole leaf length. Remarkably, this mesophyll tissue was not traced in young plants. The commercial production chain for Guzmania is characterised by a number of critical points at which the specific culture conditions sometimes change drastically, which might induce aerenchyma occurrence. Therefore, the first objective of this research was to investigate the leaf anatomy of plants situated at these critical points in the production chain with attention for the various environmental conditions possibly affecting aerenchyma occurrence. The second objective was unraveling the specific function of the aerenchyma. It was proposed that together with the chlorenchyma, it plays an undeniable role in photosynthesis. More specifically, chlorenchyma might be responsible for light captation, while the aerenchyma is important for gas exchange and Normal 0 false false false MicrosoftInternetExplorer 4 /* Style Definitions */ table.

Moreover, it was investigated if the function of the aerenchyma was related to the typical tank habit of Guzmania. The formation of aerenchyma can proceed through a lysigenous or <b>schizogenous</b> pathway. In Guzmania the aerenchyma is of the <b>schizogenous</b> type. During differentiation of aerenchyma cells, unequal growth of the cell surface creates bulges at certain points, which further develop into long arms. The tips of adjoining arms remain connected with one another, creating intercellular air spaces. This process of differentiation, which takes place already in the smallest non chlorophyll containing leaves, gives rise to the specific form of aerenchyma cells in Bromeliaceae. Ontogeny was found to have a pronounced influence on aerenchyma occurrence in Guzmania ranging from no aerenchyma in small plants to a large amount of well developed aerenchyma in older developmental stages. Moreover, at a certain stage during ontogeny aerenchyma arises as a simple structure. The presence of this transitional aerenchyma in fully developed leaves indicates that it is not involved in the progressing formation of the aerenchyma discussed above. The possibility exists that it concerns a transitional leaf type, but the true significance remains to be resolved. The presence of photosynthetic proteins in the chloroplasts of aerenchyma and chlorenchyma of Guzmania shows that both mesophyllic cell types play a role in photosynthesis. The chlorenchyma, which displays a palisade like structure when aerenchyma is developed, is the most photosynthetically active tissue for both light captation as Normal 0 false false false MicrosoftInternetExplorer 4 /* Style Definitions */ table.

Conversely, shade acclimation leads to thinner leaves with lower amounts of aerenchyma. When light levels are low, less photosynthesis takes place, which may lead to lower gas diffusion and hence, a lower need for aerenchyma tissue. Other environmental factors do not affect the aerenchyma development. Neither do the specific in vitro culture conditions influence theoccurrence of the aerenchyma in Guzmania. No definite relation could be established between the aerenchyma and juvenility. We believe the aerenchyma develops constitutively as plants gain biomass and increase their leaf thickness massively during ontogeny. Thickness of the leaves renders gas exchange considerably more difficult. Our interpretation is that the aerenchyma represents a unique solution to the existing trade-off between thick leaves and sufficient gas exchange as it offers the necessary thickness and rigidity to the leaves, {{while at the same time}} ensuring adequate gas diffusion throughout the leaf. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{fact that}} {{production}} of pome fruits is both season and location dependent calls for preservation methods {{to maintain the}} quality of the produce after harvest. The principal method to preserve pome fruit is postharvest storage in cool rooms under Controlled Atmosphere (CA) or Ultra Low Oxygen (ULO) conditions. These methods are based on empirical trials to determine optimum storage conditions for a specific cultivar in terms of temperature, oxygen and carbon dioxide concentration and relative humidity. Improved understanding of the underlying fruit physiology in relation to the gas and water exchange processes during storage will assist in improving postharvest quality and reducing the occurrence of storage disorders. Both experimental and modeling approaches have been followed to investigate the relationship between the gas concentration, gas diffusion, respiration and physiological disorders in apple and pear. Experimental approaches are, however, costly, tiresome and time consuming. Moreover, it is difficult to investigate the time course of the physiological disorders experimentally {{because of the lack of}} non-destructive techniques to measure the internal gas concentration in the fruit. Alternatively, mathematical models can be used to study gas and water exchange. They are usually based on the continuum hypothesis where the fruit is considered as a material with transport properties that are independent of the spatial scale. However, unlike the traditional engineering materials fruit tissue has a complex fine structure. The cellular architecture is believed to determine to a large extent the biophysical processes in the fruit. The continuum hypothesis does not hold in this case and a multiscale approach is required in which the model parameters of the model that operates at the macroscale  the scale of interest  are obtained from simulations with a microscale model that incorporates the actual microstructure of the fruit. For the latter, microscale geometric models of the fruit are required. Pome fruit tissue microscale geometry generators exist today but are based on digitized 2 D or 3 D images of the cellular architecture. Therefore, although these algorithms generate representative geometries of the tissues, they require experimental input in terms of microscopic images. These approaches need complex image acquisition procedures and expensive infrastructures such as synchrotron radiation sources. Also, they do not allow to parameterize the microscale geometry to, for example, investigate the effect of cell size or shape on the transport properties in a systematic way. The main objective of this dissertation was to develop virtual microscale fruit tissue generators (algorithms) that generate statistically and spatially equivalent virtual tissue microstructures resolving the cell symplast, cell wall and intercellular air spaces in both 2 D and 3 D and interface them to finite element and/or finite volume codes. To achieve this, we have developed virtual tissue generators that are based on cell growth modeling bytaking into account cell biomechanics. The generators are initiated from a random Voronoi tessellation and growth biomechanics is applied to the tessellation which results in a virtual tissue that has equivalent geometrical properties as that of real tissues obtained from microscopic or synchrotron microtomography images. In a further extension we have also developed a cell division algorithm which is based on cell biomechanics and that is capable of mimicking both symmetric cell division and asymmetric cell division with different degree of anisotropic growth. The cell division algorithm can be used instead of the Voronoi tessellation as an input for the expansive growth models. Initial tessellations obtained from the cell division algorithm will have more realistic representation of the cells than the Voronoi tessellations. The geometric models can be used to carry out in silico simulations to determine transport properties to be used in multiscale framework of gas and moisture exchange studies in pome fruits. This approach helps to include more geometrical details and fewer assumptions than the classical continuum modeling approach, while requiring less computer time compared to solving governing model equations at the resolution of the microscale.

40|$|The {{author of}} this study, Jo sip Linardic, {{assistant}} of the Botanical department of the Faculty of Sciences at the University in Zagreb, began the investigations on the Adriatic Fucus in 1939. Fucus virsoides is an interesting endemic species in the Adriatic Sea, {{not only because of}} its ecologic properties, characteristic distribution on the north-east coast, but also because of its systematic value. Whilst many botanists consider it as a specific endemic species, the French algologue Sau- v a g e a u suspects its value as an independent species, and considers it as identic to the Atlantic species Fucus platycar- pus, var. spiralis. To solve correctly this important question of the systematic value of the Adriatic Fucus, it was necessary to investigate it from the morphological, ecological, chorological and finally systematical point of view. The author had finished his investigations at the end of 1940, and the manuscript was done {{at the beginning of the}} hard year 1941. Then began the invasion of Yugoslavia by the enemy’s army of which the author fell a martyr because of his political and national faith, when sentenced to death by a special occupator’s tribunal on 4. VIII. 1941., and so he gave his life for the national deliverance of his country. The redactor of »Acta Botanica« returned after the war to his position as the chief of the Botanical department of the University; he found the manuscript of Josiip Linardic in Croatian language preserved in the Botanical Institute. As the investigations were performed under his leading, he prepared this manuscript for print, and wrote this summary in English. I. In the first part of the paper there is shown in detail the morphology of thallus, which is differentiated and consists of three parts: basal disk with rhizoids, rounded stalk (stipes, cau- loid) bilateral leaf-blade of phyloid. The ramification is typically dichotom-dichopodial. The deviations from the regular dichopodium show only adventive branches, which grow on injured parts of the thallus. »Krypto- stomata« are described in details. The author considers them as organs for absorption of mineral foods. Kryptostomata develop by the reduction of conceptacula changing their reproductive function with that of feeding. In observing the development of the egg, it is found that from the egg develops the embryo by a gradual division analoguely to that known in other species of Fucus. On the thallus of Fucus can often be found prolifications on the bitten parts. These prolifications are described in other species of Fucus and also in the species Fucus virsoides (Meneg- hini, Forti, Vouk). The author could not find out exactly what causes the prolifications, but through some experiments in the aquarium he suspects that the thallus is bitten by a seahedgehog (Paracentrotus lividus). On the bitten parts begins the formation of prolifications the origin of which is shown in details. There are also described utricular anomal formation on the thallus, which have their origin in the <b>schizogenous</b> disruption of the tissue. The anatomical structure of the thallus is shown in details from the point of view of physiologic — anatomical systems. The functional division is still not carried out absolutely, so that some tissue — systems have two or more functions, one of those being of primary, and others of secondary value. Still there can be clearly differentiated the cortical — and vascular — (medular) and mechanical-system. The cortical- system consists of epidermis and cortex. The epidermis is very well and clearly developed in the inside of the cells very well differentiated with chloroplasts on the bottom, and with fuco- san-granules in the upper part of the cells. The epidermis has the function of secreting mucus on the surface. Immediatly underneath the epidermis is formed the primary cortex with some layers of cells. It has the assimilating function and from it spring out elements of mechanical tissue. In the lower, round parts of thallus is formed the secondary cortex. The primary cortex has its beginning in the epidermis. The vascular elements are placed in the center, and consist of cylindric, elongated cells. The membranes swell easily forming mucus, and they have pits in the cell-walls, they contain very few plastids and the assimilatory function is reduced, however they contain fucosan. Their function is to accumulate and conduct the assimilates. The hyphae are mechanical elements. Hyphae are long, thin, with tiny lumen, but with thickened membranes. They are mixed with vascular elements, and are concentrated toward the central rib, and especially in a greater number toward the basal disk. Protoplasts are reduced but still contain fucosan. With exact comparative investigations the author found out, that there are no differences between northern and southern forms, as J. Schiller states. II. In the second part of the study is shown in details the ecology of the algae, the relations to the temperature, the salinity, the movements of the sea and the light. The substratum is acting only as a mechanical factor, and not as a physiological one. The highest level of the high tide determines the upper limit of the vegetation-zone of the Fucus, and the lowest level of the low-tide determines its lower one. The Fucus is a typical plant living in the zone of high and low tide. The movements of the sea have a great influence upon the vegetation, so that the samples on unexposed places are always bigger than the ones exposed to the sea waves. The Adriatic Fucus avoides exposed coasts. J. S c h i 11 e r’s statement, that samples from southern coasts are smaller and weaker than the ones from the northern coasts, is not correct. Fucus is a plant adapted to the low and high tide, and dies in a constant culture in the water. In relation to the salinity Fucus virsoides is an euryhaline species with its optimum inclined more toward the average minimum. According to that, this algae can be defined as mi- kroeuryhalynic typus in the sence of Vouk’s theory of valences. It seeks places with sweetened water. Concerning the temperature, the Adriatic Fucus is an eurythermal algae with its optimum at the lower temperatures (mikroeurythermal Types). As the Adriatic Fucus is partly a terrestrial plant, for its life is important also the temperature of the air, and this is also a limiting factor, which determines its distribution to the south-western Mediterranean Sea. Concerning the light, the Adriatic Fucus is an eminently euryphotic i. e. makroeuryphotic algae, because its ecological optimum is nearer to the maximum. III. In the third part the author discusses the systematic position of the Adriatic Fucus. There is shown the whole history of this algae, which was for the first time described by Vitaliono Donati in 1750 as »virsoide«, according to which Agardh in 1868 gave its first diagnosis under the name of Fucus virsoides. From that time on, this algae has been described under different synonymes, but because of its priority the name of Fucus virsoides has been kept up. In spite of searching the etymology of the word »virsoide«, the author could neither find the meaning of this word nor anything positive about the etymology of this word. The author reexamined all the arguments on the basis of which Sauvageau had identified this species with Fucus platycarpus var. spiralis, and found as a result, that none of those arguments could be accepted and that the Adriatic Fucus had a right to be categorized as an independent species, as stated by Agardh. Sauvageau thinks that the Adriatic Fucus has its origin in the oceanic species Fucus platycarpus, which were occasionally distributed in the Adriatic Sea brought from the Atlantic Ocean, and means only a geographical disjunction of the Atlantic species of F. platycarpus var. spiralis. The author point out some essential differences between the species F. platycarpus and F. virsoides: 1. F. platycarpus has the ramification of the dichopodial sympodium, whilst the F. virsoides is a typical and regular di- chopodium. 2. There is a difference in the size between both species. Whilst F. platycarpus has the maximal size of 60 — 80 cm, F. virsoides grows usually till 20 — 28 cm. In the same way the segments of F. platycarpus are much wider than the ones of F. virsoides. 3. There is a difference in the receptacula of both species. In F. platycarpus receptacula are placed usually laterally on the shorter lateral branches or terminally in pairs. In F. virsoides receptacula are always placed terminally in pairs. 4. A considerable difference exists between both species in their area of distribution. F. virsoides is usually found on the east coast of the Adriatic Sea mostly to the South till Boka Ko- torska, whilst on the West coats of the North Adriatic it is found very seldom and only till Ancona. In all the other parts of the Adriatic Sea this Fucus is not found, the same as the related species F. platycarpus var. spiralis, which is distributed in the Atlantic coasts northern from Far Oar and Iceland and Canada and on the East from The Canarian isles. The reason that species did not enter Gibraltar and the Mediterranean Sea is probably the high temperature of the air during the summer-months. It is also significant, that F. virsoides, if it originates from the migration of the species F. platycarpus, is not found at all the North-West coasts of the Mediterranean Sea (Italy, France, Spain). The ecovalences of the species F. virsoides prevent its migration in the south Adriatic and Mediterranean Sea. The author thinks, that these both species were represented by one at the end of the tertiary period and in the early quartery-period. Only later by changing of the paleoclimatic and paleogeographic relations and by the formation of the Adriatic geosynclinalis in the diluvium, and by moving of the climate zone after the ice periods toward the North, began this undivided species its differentiation in two new ones. By the formation of new climatic-relations in the Mediterranean, respectively of the subtropic-mediterranean climate, the continuality of the earlier undivided area of the hypothetic species was broken. At last the author gives a new, with new arguments enlar- gened diagnosis of the Adriatic Fucus, and considers it as of full value of a separate, morphologically, ecologically and genetically well characterized endemic species. IV. The author studies the variability of the forms of the Adriatic Fucus, of which he has described several forms and varieties. Analyzing these forms, which have been recently described by Forti, on basis of abundant material from the whole coast from the most northern to the most southern point of the area, he gives lis folowing opinion about all known forms: f. normalis Schiffner gives an exact diagnosis of the typus. f. normalis major bene evoluta Schiffner, has not the value of a separate systematic unit. f. normalis basinudus Schiffner. has not the value of a separate systematic unit. f. normalis partim accedens ad var. subnudam Schiffner, has to be put off as a systematic unit, f. angusta Schiffner, form characterized with narrow segments, well differentiated from the normal form (f. normalis) and never appears mixed. f. angustior Schiffner has no diagnosis and has to be put off as a separate form. f. denudata Schiffner, form shows pathological denudation and cannot be considered as a separate systematic unit, var. subnuda Schiffner, the same as the above form has not the value of a separate systematic unit, var. subemersa minor Schiffner, this zonal variety cannot be considered as a separate systematic unit. var. acutiloba Forti, does not appear on the east coast of the Adriatic Sea, but is a good morphological and geogra- phycal systematic unit. var. longifructus Forti, good characterized form with double or triple elongated receptacula. var. subvesiculosa Forti, this form with swollen receptacula which are not hollow, cannot be considered as a separate systematic form. f. australis Sehiffner, according to mentioned signs it cannot be considered as a separate systematic form, f. minúscula Linardić, a small, dwarfy form, only 2 — 4 cm. the author describes it as a separate form and gives his own diagnosis. According to that, from all the above mentioned forms only these can be kept as separate ones: var. acutiloba Forti, var. longifructus Forti, f. normalis Scliffner, f. augusta Sehiffner and f. minúscula Linardić. All the other forms have to be off as separate systematic forms either as varieties or as forms. V. In the last part about chorology of the Adriatic Fucus the author brings an exact list of all till now known localities of this algae, completing this list with his own statements and getting out of all that the area of distribution. Its center is the Trieste, Venetian- and Quarnero-Bay and the Croation Coast. The area elongates till Boka Kotorska on the east coast, and till Ancona on the west coast. The author gave the exact geographical map of the distribution of this algae in his earlier work: »Contribution to the geographical distribution of the Adriatic Fucus«.
