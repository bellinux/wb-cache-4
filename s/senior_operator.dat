5000|$|SWATThe LVMPD SWAT team is {{a nationally}} {{respected}} organization. The team, composed of nearly 40 operators, {{is one of}} a handful of full-time SWAT teams in the country. The team's main objective is to save lives, victims as well as suspects. They are on the cutting edge on the use of a constantly changing array of less-lethal weapons and munitions. Team members are highly trained and work in no less than two-man cells. They are referred to as Zebra units and not called the 'Zebra Squadron' as it is asserted by the narrator on an often repeated cable documentary. However, their designated LVMPD call sign is Z, phonetically in the LVMPD alphabet- Zebra. The individual officers are denoted by their seniority in the unit. Therefore, Z1 (or Zebra 1) is the most <b>senior</b> <b>operator</b> and Z37 is the junior. This nomenclature applies to other units within the department as well. LVMPD SWAT conducts training both for LVMPD recruits and seasoned officers within the department plus visiting agencies from across the country as well as foreign police units. In any given year, they will respond to an average of 55 hostage incidents and execute over 365 high risk search warrants and/or arrest warrants. [...] SWAT also provides dignitary protection for the President of the United States, the Vice President, visiting heads of state and other dignitaries during visits to the Las Vegas area.|$|E
40|$|LLC (AmerGen) is {{requesting}} NRC {{approval of}} an exemption from {{the requirements of}} 10 CFR 55. 31, "How to Apply, " paragraph (a) (5) regarding reactivity or power level manipulations performed by applicants for operator and <b>senior</b> <b>operator</b> licenses at Clinton Power Station (CPS). The requested exemption would allow the required reactivity or power level changes to be perfofnlied by an applicant on the actual plant and/or the plant referenced simulator for the facility. The need for the requested exemption is driven by improvements in plant operations and capacity factors that have reduced the opportunities for applicants for operator and <b>senior</b> <b>operator</b> licenses to perform the number of required reactivity or power level changes on the actual plant without impacting planned full power operation. Additionally, the number of candidates being enrolled in our operator and <b>senior</b> <b>operator</b> training program is increasing.

40|$|Summary Background: Congenital melanocytic nevi {{are present}} at birth or may {{appear in the}} first weeks of life. Small and medium-size lesions are {{relatively}} common, affecting approximately 1 % of newborns; large or giant melanocytic nevi occur in 1 / 20, 000 e 1 / 500, 000 births. The main concern raised by these lesions is their potential risk of degeneration which is strongly size-dependent and estimated in the literature between 0 % and 40 % over a lifetime. Although multiple treatment modalities have been described, to date {{there is no consensus}} regarding their optimal management. Patients and methods: Four neonates (three females and one male) presenting giant congenital nevi with a mean age 12 days (7 e 24 days) were referred to our Plastic Surgery department for treatment from 2012 to 2013. All patients underwent an alternative dermabrasion procedure with the innovative use of hydrosurgery. All procedures were performed under general anaesthesia by the same <b>senior</b> <b>operator</b> (Dr. B. Bayet). Results: The mean operating time was significantly reduced compared to conventional techniques. No complications were observed in the postoperative course. Good final results were obtained in three patients after a mean follow-up of respectively 11, 8 and 4 months. The first operated neonate showed a complete recurrence of pigmentation of the treated areas after 6 months. Conclusions: The need for early treatment in giant congenital nevi is admitted by all. Hydrosurgery is easy to use and allows to achieve a selective and symmetric resection with an obvious cleavage plane and clean-cut borders. Furthermore, this procedure has convinced us with its speed of use, ensuring significant time saving, and therefore less morbidity for the neonate. Aesthetic results as well as recurrence rate may be comparable to conventional techniques. However, regular follow-up to detect any malignancy is necessary...|$|E
40|$|Background: The present paper {{describes}} a training method with objective evaluation to enhance video-assisted surgical skills in subfascial endoscopic perforator veins surgery (SEPS). Training was scheduled during a 2 -day intensive course. Methods: Hands-on exercises were performed (i) on a simulator {{to assess whether}} specific training exercises were helpful in attainment of skills; (ii) on a known animal model that uses the swine abdominal wall and which allows practice in endoscopic dissection and perforator veins (PV) using appropriate instrumentation {{in an environment that}} is a reasonable surrogate for the human calf; and (iii) assisting a senior surgeon performing SEPS. Thirty surgeons without experience in SEPS were trained to perform a sequence of standardized drills connected with the SEPS technique. The SEPS simulator consisted of an artificially constructed subfascial space of the leg in which false perforator veins had to be localized, and cut. The participants performed a sequence of drills three times in order to improve their dexterity. The same exercises were then performed on a swine model. The model consisted of the arteries and veins penetrating the rectus fascia and passing into the overlying cutaneous trunci muscle and hypodermis {{on either side of the}} midline between the arch of the ribs cranially and the umbilicus caudally. Trainees were required to achieve operative space in the animal subcutaneous fat, to reach and identify the 'perforating' subcutaneous vessels, and to interrupt some of them with a 5 -mm clamp coagulator ultrasonic scalpel. The time required to perform each dexterity drill was recorded in seconds. Finally, the day after, trainees were asked to drive the <b>senior</b> <b>operator</b> during clinical SEPS performed on eight patients, suggesting the following manoeuvres in order to: (i) enter the subfascial space of the leg; (ii) make operative space; (iii) identify the incompetent perforator vein(s); and (iv) coagulate and divide them with the ultrasonic scalpel. Each of these four steps scored 1 point. Results: All the trainees showed a steady improvement in skill acquisition on the SEPS simulator (P < 0. 001), and on the animal model with the single-port technique (P < 0. 001). These results reflect positively on the animal model using the dual-port technique, and on the scores achieved in the operating theatre during clinical SEPS. Conclusions: The validity of the 2 -day course was demonstrated by significant improvement in performance with increasing skill on the training models, and in clinical practice...|$|E
40|$|U. S. {{agriculture}} {{in the twentieth century}} evidenced dramatic change. With the {{reduction in the number of}} occupational farmers, the future of these farm operations and the decisions that shape the sector are of paramount importance. The objectives and choices made by farmers, particularly their approaches to business succession, will have significant impacts on the farm community and the future structure of U. S. agriculture. ^ The first paper of this thesis identifies factors that influence primacy between generations in the management structure of U. S. family farms. The paper fills an important gap in the farm succession literature by exploring succession (in management of the farm) as an incremental process. Estimation with cross-sectional data from the USDA-ERS’ Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) and a limited dependent variable model explains the decision for younger generation operators to assume primary farm management duties while a <b>senior</b> <b>operator</b> moves to a secondary role. Our findings include a number of statistically significant attributes that explain variation in the younger farmer’s managerial role (primary versus secondary). These results suggest that transferring primary operator status is more strongly influenced by family members’ characteristics such as age and education than any particular set of farm financial or operating characteristics. ^ The second paper of this thesis focuses on the lifecycle income objective of business-owning (farm and nonfarm) households. Specifically, we test for differences in saving behavior of these entrepreneurial households relative to the average U. S. household. We hypothesize that the complex relationship between household and business management decisions has the potential to counter predictions from standard household savings theory, a notion that previous studies in the literature have failed to take into account. With an increasing number of small business-owning families, this has the potential for analyses to misrepresent household savings rates. Here again we use a limited dependent variable model, keying in on the saving behavior and ability of household respondents in the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) for 2007. Econometric investigation is used to describe which attributes influence the probability of a household attaining a positive saving level in the past year. The estimation results indicate that, along with standard demographic influences of savings models, households owning a farm or nonfarm business have a significantly higher likelihood of maintaining private saving in a given year. Our results highlight the necessity for future research on household saving behavior to account for the differing objectives and choice sets faced by households that own businesses when conducting analysis of household saving. ...|$|E
