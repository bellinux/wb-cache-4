His numerous quotations from ancient and contemporary authors and various schools of thought are a proof of his extensive reading. His works shed light on some of the difficult questions in Scotistic philosophy and theology.|$|R
60|$|In {{all this}} time the true state of the several Presidencies, and the real conduct of the British {{government}} towards the natives, {{was not at all}} known to Parliament: it seems to have been very imperfectly known even to ministers. Indeed, it required an unbroken attention, and much comparison of facts and reasonings, to form a true judgment on that difficult and complicated system of politics, revenue, and commerce, whilst affairs were only in their progress to that state which produced the present inquiries. Therefore, whilst the causes of their ruin were in the height of their operation, both the Company and the natives were understood by the public as in circumstances the most assured and most flourishing; insomuch that, whenever the affairs of India were brought before Parliament, as they were two or three times during that period, the only <b>subject-matter</b> <b>of</b> <b>discussion</b> anywise important was concerning the sums which might be taken out of the Company's surplus profits for the advantage of the state. Little was thought of but the disengagement of the Company from their debts in England, and to prevent the servants abroad from drawing upon them, so as that body might be enabled, without exciting clamors here, to afford the contribution that was demanded. All descriptions of persons, either here or in India, looking solely to appearances at home, the reputation of the Directors depended on the keeping the Company's sales in a situation to support the dividend, that of the ministers depended on the most lucrative bargains for the Exchequer, and that of the servants abroad on the largest investments; until at length there is great reason to apprehend, that, unless some very substantial reform takes place in the management of the Company's affairs, nothing will be left for investment, for dividend, or for bargain, and India, instead of a resource to the public, may itself come, in no great length of time, to be reckoned amongst the public burdens.|$|R
40|$|RÉSUMÉ IN ENGLISH The {{topic of}} this master thesis is the {{principle}} of promptness in the criminal proceedings because this question is nowadays the <b>subject-matter</b> <b>of</b> numerous <b>discussions,</b> {{in which it is}} spoken about overloaded Czech justice system, about delays in court proceedings and about options, how to relieve the system of Czech criminal justice system. The aim of the submitted thesis is to evaluate critically the current legal institutes helping to make the criminal proceedings faster, mainly the investigation of crimes, and to contemplate its potential extension, without having caused any more significant limitation of the right of the accused to defence. Among other principles, which stay often contrary to the principle of promptness and which the legislators always must bear in mind, are the principle of material truth and the principle of contradiction. The thesis is divided into seven basic chapters. The first chapter is the introduction. The second chapter deals with the meaning of promptness of criminal proceedings for each particular subject of the criminal proceedings, mainly for the accused and the injured party. Third chapter presents the statistic data on the average length of proceedings in the Czech Republic and within the European Union: the average length of criminal proceedings leaded [...] ...|$|R

50|$|In case T 307/03, which {{related to}} a pending divisional {{application}} of a granted European patent, three requests were pending. In the main request, the <b>subject-matter</b> <b>of</b> claim 1 corresponded exactly to the <b>subject-matter</b> <b>of</b> claim 3 when dependent on claim 1 of the granted European patent (that is, the patent granted on the parent application). The claim was therefore objected for double patenting and the main request was not allowed into the proceedings. The first auxiliary request was not allowed into the proceedings for essentially the same reasons. Finally, in the second auxiliary request, the <b>subject-matter</b> <b>of</b> the main claim encompassed by the <b>subject-matter</b> <b>of</b> claim 3 of the parent application as granted. This request was also not allowed into the proceedings on the ground of double patenting. The divisional application was therefore refused.|$|R

50|$|The Essay {{has been}} {{described}} as different from earlier writings on economic methodology in generating a range of tightly-argued, radical implications from a simple definition, for example in admitting an aspect of behaviour (rather than a list of behaviours) but not limiting the <b>subject-matter</b> <b>of</b> economics, provided that the influence of scarcity impinges on these (pp. 16-17). The broad behavioural definition is credited for its consistency with the expanding boundaries of economics decades later. In this Robbins both narrows the definition of economics, thereby demonstrating the usefulness of deduction, and opens up the <b>subject-matter</b> <b>of</b> economics.|$|R
