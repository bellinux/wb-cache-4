25|$|Many {{arrangements}} of electrical contacts are used. Large lamps {{may have a}} <b>screw</b> <b>base</b> (one or more contacts at the tip, one at the shell) or a bayonet base (one or more contacts on the base, shell used as a contact or used only as a mechanical support). Some tubular lamps have an electrical contact at either end. Miniature lamps may have a wedge base and wire contacts, and some automotive and special purpose lamps have screw terminals for connection to wires. Contacts in the lamp socket allow the electric current {{to pass through the}} base to the filament. Power ratings for incandescent light bulbs range from about 0.1 watt to about 10,000 watts.|$|E

Christmas lights use various base sizes E17 for C9 bulbs, E12 for C7 bulbs, E10 for decades-old series-wired C6 bulb sets in the U.S., and an entirely different wedge base for T1¾ mini lights.

25|$|Polarization is {{maintained}} by the shape, size, or position of plug pins and socket holes and socket recesses {{to ensure that a}} plug fits only one way into a socket.

50|$|The Light's base {{consisted}} of seven wrought iron piles {{embedded in the}} sands. Each was 16 ft long with cast-iron <b>screw</b> <b>bases</b> 3 ft in diameter. The six corner piles formed a hexagonal platform of 50 ft diameter. (The seventh pile served as a centre pillar.) The platform supported the lantern and a two-storey building to house the keeper. Construction began in 1839 and the lantern was lit on 6 June 1840. The building was destroyed by fire in 1948 and not replaced. After the fire, the beacon was made automatic and eventually replaced by a lighted buoy in 1979, leaving behind a derelict structure.|$|R
5000|$|Miniature lights {{first came}} in sets of 35 (3.5 volts per bulb), and {{sometimes}} smaller sets of 20 (6 volts per bulb). For a short time, these early miniature lights were manufactured using E5 <b>screw</b> <b>bases,</b> rather than the current wedge base and were called [...] "Italian lights". Sets of ten (12 volts per bulb) were made for very small trees, but are quite hot, and are now usually used for tree toppers only. This number is convenient for stars, which have a total of ten points (five outward and five inward), and often have another light in the middle, occasionally on both sides.|$|R

30|$|In the {{following}} two sections, 5 -axis PKMs having 2 T 3 R motion will be taken as example to show the detailed procedures of this finite and instantaneous <b>screw</b> <b>based</b> approach for topology design and kinematic analysis. Firstly, type synthesis {{of this kind of}} PKMs will be done utilizing finite screws, which will result in numerous new topology structures with potential industrial applications. Then, the kinematic analysis of a typical structure, i.e., the METROM PKM, will be conducted to show how to directly obtain the parametric model <b>based</b> upon instantaneous <b>screws</b> through differentiating the corresponding topological model. The Jacobian matrix and constraint force will be formulated, which is ready for parameter optimization and performance evaluation.|$|R
50|$|Various other {{accessories}} have been made, including a smoke detector that recharges {{over a few}} hours and lasts {{for a few days}} or weeks thereafter, and still allows the attached lamp to operate normally. There have also been electronics that stick onto the end of the <b>screw</b> <b>base</b> and allow the attached lamp to flash, for example, {{to attract the attention of}} arriving guests or emergency vehicles; others function as a dimmer or timer, or dim gradually in a child's bedroom in the evening.|$|E
50|$|LED lamps {{are made}} of arrays of SMD modules that replace {{incandescent}} or compact fluorescent lamps, mostly replacing incandescent lamps rated from 5 to 60 watts. Such lamps are made with standard lamp connections and shapes, such as an Edison <b>screw</b> <b>base,</b> an MR16 shape with a bi-pin base, or a GU5.3 (bi-pin cap) or GU10 (bayonet fitting) and are made compatible with the voltage supplied to the sockets. They include driver circuitry to rectify the AC power and convert the voltage to an appropriate value, usually a switched-mode power supply.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} tubes, {{like the}} Deforest Spherical Audion from c. 1911, used the typical light bulb Edison socket for the heater, and flying leads {{for the other}} elements. Other tubes directly used flying leads for all of their contacts, like the Cunningham AudioTron from 1915, or the Deforest Oscillion. Type C6A xenon thyratrons, used in servos for the U.S. Navy Stable Element Mark 6, had a mogul <b>screw</b> <b>base</b> and L-shaped stiff wires at the top for grid and anode connections. Mating connectors were machined pairs of brass blocks with clamping screws, attached to flying leads (free hanging).|$|E
40|$|Posterior transarticular spine fusion is a {{surgical}} procedure used {{to stabilize the}} cervical bodies Cl and C 2. Currently, spine. screws are used most frequently, according to the procedure of Magerl. As the anatomy is rather complex and the view is limited, this procedure has a high risk factor. Thus we present and validate a planning system for cervical <b>screw</b> insertion <b>based</b> oil preoperative CT imaging. It allows a neurosurgeon to interactively determine the desired position of the cervical <b>screws,</b> <b>based</b> on appropriate and in real-time calculated reslices through the preoperative CT data. Guided by this information, a personalized mechanical drill guide is produced. The system is validated by five cadaver experiments. Based on the preoperative planning, screws are inserted through the drill guide. A semi-automatic technique is used to extract the screw locations from the postoperative images. The deviations of the axes of the planned and the inserted screws are determined in this way. We have observed that the drill guides are not yet stable enough {{to cope with the}} drilling forces that they are subjected to. As a result, they tend to displace. However, most of the inserted screws were judged to be adequately placed. No vascular compromise nor invasion of the spinal canal was observed. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|Pearson {{had gone}} into {{business}} in Chicago. By the late 19th century, he operated a small manufacturing company that made screws and developed technology which made his company valuable enough to sell to Standard <b>Screw</b> (<b>based</b> in Connecticut) in 1900. When appointed as president in 1904, Pearson soon doubled the company's subsidiaries from four to eight, increasing their skilled workforce and facilities. He led Standard Screw Company to dominance in the industry through the early twentieth century. Together with two other leaders, Pearson introduced the [...] " [...] 'new Standard Automatic,' a machine that reduced the cost of making screws nearly 40 percent." [...] In 1904 he reduced prices, which gave the company an edge with the new auto manufacturers, whose rapid expansion as an industry fed Standard's profits.|$|R
