5|$|The Sinclair {{method is}} a method of using {{naltrexone}} or another opioid antagonists to treat alcoholism by having the person take the medication {{about an hour before}} they drink alcohol, and only then. The medication blocks the positive reinforcement effects of ethanol and hopefully allows the person to <b>stop</b> <b>drinking</b> or drink less.|$|E
5|$|Alcoholism is characterised by an {{increased}} tolerance to alcohol–which means {{that an individual}} can consume more alcohol–and physical dependence on alcohol, which {{makes it hard for}} an individual to control their consumption. The physical dependency caused by alcohol can lead to an affected individual having a very strong urge to drink alcohol. These characteristics play a role decreasing an alcoholic's ability to <b>stop</b> <b>drinking.</b> Alcoholism can have adverse effects on mental health, causing psychiatric disorders and increasing the risk of suicide. A depressed mood is a common symptom of heavy alcohol drinkers.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, local townspeople went to {{see what}} happened, and 100 to 200 people who got near to the {{meteorite}} crater soon reported feeling sick. First responding police officers arriving to investigate the scene also fell ill. After the initial event of September 15, {{the number of people}} falling ill increased, requiring physicians to establish auxiliary medical tents for the Carancas health center. Patients were treated for dermal injuries, nausea, headaches, diarrhea and vomiting. The death of nearby livestock was also reported. Locals made the decision to <b>stop</b> <b>drinking</b> from nearby water sources for fear of contamination and authorities considered declaring a state of emergency. Four days after the meteorite impact and the unexplained illness, most villagers reported having recovered.|$|E

5|$|Chlordiazepoxide is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used benzodiazepine for alcohol detoxification, but diazepam may be used as an alternative. Both are used in the detoxification of individuals who are motivated to <b>stop</b> <b>drinking,</b> and are prescribed {{for a short period of}} time to reduce the risks of developing tolerance and dependence to the benzodiazepine medication itself. The benzodiazepines with a longer half-life make detoxification more tolerable, and dangerous (and potentially lethal) alcohol withdrawal effects are less likely to occur. On the other hand, short-acting benzodiazepines may lead to breakthrough seizures, and are, therefore, not recommended for detoxification in an outpatient setting. Oxazepam and lorazepam are often used in patients at risk of drug accumulation, in particular, the elderly and those with cirrhosis, because they are metabolized differently from other benzodiazepines, through conjugation.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{provides}} a brief {{introduction to the}} topic of presupposition, and then discuses three major approaches to this phenomenon, focusing on the answers which each approach gives to two foundational questions: What is presupposition? And how, or why, does it arise? 1. The phenomenon Consider sentence (1) : (1) Jane has <b>stopped</b> <b>drinking</b> coffee in the evening. Among other things, this sentence entails: (2) Jane has <b>stopped</b> <b>drinking</b> coffee after 10 pm. Unsurprisingly, the negation of sentence (1), shown in (3), does not share this entailment. Neither does the yes/no question formed from this sentence. Similarly, if we add a possibility modal to the sentence, or construct a conditional of which (1) is the antecedent, the resulting sentences do not share the entailment of the original, as we see from the examples below: (3) Jane hasn’t <b>stopped</b> <b>drinking</b> coffee in the evening. (4) Has Jane <b>stopped</b> <b>drinking</b> coffee in the evening? (5) Jane might’ve <b>stopped</b> <b>drinking</b> coffee in the evening. (6) If Jane has <b>stopped</b> <b>drinking</b> coffee in the evening, she is probably sleeping better. In other words, sentences (3) -(6) illustrate entailment-cancelling embeddings of sentence (1). Now consider another entailment of our original sentence (1) : (7) Jane used to drink coffee in the evening. A speaker who utters any of the sentences in (3) -(6), sentences which are not expected to preserve any of the entailments of (1), remains committed to the truth of the proposition in (7). This proposition, entailed by (1) and implied in some sense by the related sentences (3) -(6), is considered a presupposition of all of them. What does it mean to say that these propositions are presuppositions? That is the central question in the study of this topic. A significant literature on presupposition exists in both linguistics an...|$|R
5|$|Vainio's friends Heikki Kauppinen and Reijo Tani quit {{drinking}} in 1972, {{and at first}} Vainio found their decision odd. When Vexi Salmi was hired by Fazer in 1970, Vainio and Salmi started drinking together often and sometimes even came to work with hangovers. On one occasion, Vainio forgot that {{he was supposed to}} have finished the text of an advertising tune. When the deadline arrived, Vainio was too hung over to finish the lyrics and eventually Salmi agreed to help by writing the lyrics for Vainio's composition. Vainio's alcohol use increased in the 1970s, and his parents watched without being able to do anything about it. It is reported that Vainio would not go to sleep at night unless he had liquor under his bed, and he always kept a bottle with him. Vainio began to realize that he could not live like this forever. By summer 1975 he decided that he needed to <b>stop</b> <b>drinking</b> altogether. He was especially helped in this decision through his meeting footballer Kai Pahlman, who told Vainio that he was surprised he was still alive. In late 1975, Vainio stayed sober for four months, but then caved in for a short time. In January 1976 he finally managed to {{quit drinking}} for good.|$|E

25|$|During {{its early}} years The Salvation Army faced {{a great deal of}} opposition, {{especially}} from those in the alcohol-selling industry who were concerned that the activities of Booth and his followers would persuade the poorer classes to <b>stop</b> <b>drinking.</b> One group opposed to Booth and The Salvation Army was the Skeleton Army, a diffuse group, particularly in Southern England, that opposed and disrupted The Salvation Army's marches against alcohol from the early 1880s until about 1892. Clashes between the two groups lead to the deaths of several Salvationists and injuries to many others. During 1882 alone 662 Salvation Army soldiers were assaulted: 251 of them were women and 23 of them were under fifteen years of age.|$|E

25|$|Arthur Huntingdon, Helen's abusive and {{alcoholic}} husband, is a Byronic {{figure of}} great fascination {{but also of}} barely concealed moral failings. His abusive behaviour impels Helen {{to run away from}} him, but nevertheless when he becomes ill (after falling from his horse when drunk and injuring his leg badly), Helen returns to Grassdale to take care of him. Unwilling to <b>stop</b> <b>drinking</b> alcohol, Huntingdon deteriorates in health and eventually dies. He is widely thought to be loosely based on the author's brother, Branwell, but some critics have argued that, apart from their masses of red hair, they have little in common. Along with Lord Lowborough, Huntingdon bears far stronger resemblance to two types of drunkards outlined in Robert Macnish's The Anatomy of Drunkenness.|$|E
25|$|Although Angie {{tries to}} <b>stop</b> <b>drinking,</b> her {{attempts}} always fail dismally {{and by the}} end of the year she is arrested for drink-driving when she crashes Den's car on the way home from a darts match. In episodes broadcast in 1986, Den's mistress, Jan, starts to frequent The Queen Vic. The physical arrival of Jan sends Angie's marriage into further decline as she is unable to contain her jealousy and anger. Angie becomes so depressed that she takes a near lethal cocktail of booze and pills in an attempted suicide. By chance, Den returns home early following an argument with Jan, discovers Angie and rushes her to the hospital where she has her stomach pumped. Angie recovers, but is left shaken when she discovers how close to death she actually came. Upon recovering, Angie decides to play Den at his own game and so she begins another affair with Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson). Den is furious when he discovers them in bed together, but his rage is short-lived as he has more pressing things on his mind, such as the birth of his illegitimate daughter, Vicki Fowler (Emma Herry). Angie's affair with Andy only lasts a month, ending when Andy reunites with his ex-girlfriend Debbie Wilkins (Shirley Cheriton). Andy dies in a road accident shortly afterwards.|$|E
