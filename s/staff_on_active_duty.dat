40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{compare the}} tobacco use profile of {{recruits}} {{with that of}} military personnel <b>on</b> <b>active</b> <b>duty</b> {{to determine whether the}} military environment in some way induces service members to initiate tobacco use.  DESIGN AND SETTING—Cross-sectional survey of United States armed forces <b>active</b> <b>duty</b> and recruit personnel in 1994 - 95.  SUBJECTS— 2711 military recruits and 4603  military personnel <b>on</b> <b>active</b> <b>duty.</b>  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES—Comparative cigarette smoking and smokeless tobacco use prevalence between recruits and personnel <b>on</b> <b>active</b> <b>duty</b> controlling for age, sex, and race. Impact of demographic factors on the odds of smoking or using smokeless tobacco.  RESULTS—Increases in tobacco use in American military personnel occurred exclusively in men. The highest tobacco use resided with white men <b>on</b> <b>active</b> <b>duty</b> (43 % cigarette smoking; 24 % smokeless tobacco use) and represents a doubling of tobacco use seen among white male recruits. Among non-white men, tobacco use increased 2 - 4 times between recruits and personnel <b>on</b> <b>active</b> <b>duty.</b>  CONCLUSIONS—Efforts to reduce tobacco use by American military personnel <b>on</b> <b>active</b> <b>duty</b> should focus more on discouraging the initiation of tobacco use.    Keywords: tobacco use; military personnel; United State...|$|R
