5|$|On 2 September 1666, the Great Fire of London broke out. Over 100,000 {{people were}} made homeless, {{and by the}} time the fire ended over 13,000 houses and 400 streets had been destroyed. An Act of Parliament enacted on 8 February 1667 {{constituted}} a Court of Fire, tasked with dealing with property disputes over ownership, liability and the rebuilding of the city. Hale was tasked with <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> court, which met in Clifford's Inn, and heard 140 of the 374 cases the court dealt with during its first year in operation.|$|E

At all away games the Bulldogs Army locates themselves in the general admission section. The main aim of the Bulldogs Army is to show support and passion for the Bulldogs.|$|E
25|$|After Penny’s autopsy {{revealed}} {{that she had}} ingested a lethal amount of liquid nicotine, Grissom and his team noted that there were traces of glue {{on the model of}} Penny’s back, and on the chair that she had been <b>sitting</b> <b>in.</b> <b>This</b> led them to believe that the killer had assumed that Penny would have died in her chair from her poisoned cherry brandy, not expecting her to go into convulsions. As Penny stood up in her spastic fits, the killer revealed herself, previously hiding behind Penny, and threw Penny through the window. With the miniature already made to depict Penny dead in her chair, the killer showed signs of obsessive habits, having to fix the model by rearranging it to match the actual death scene before it could be seen by anybody else. This explained why the miniature was not at the scene of death as the first one had been. A camera from Penny Garden's neighborhood showed Ernie Dell (Natalie's foster father) delivering the miniature wearing a jacket with a train symbol on the back.|$|E

25|$|He {{instituted a}} series of {{socio-economic}} reforms that produced mixed results. Though he was a Jamaican from an elite family, Manley's successful trade union background helped him to maintain {{a close relationship with}} the country's poor majority, and he was a dynamic, popular leader. Unlike his father, who had a reputation for being formal and businesslike, the younger Manley moved easily among people of all strata and made Parliament accessible to the people by abolishing the requirement for men to wear jackets and ties to its <b>sittings.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> regard he started a fashion revolution, often preferring the Kariba suit, a type of formal bush or safari jacket with trousers and worn without a shirt and tie.|$|R

500|$|Markley {{continued}} his playboy lifestyle at a beach house he purchased in Los Angeles. He produced Jim Stallings' (J. J. Light) European hit [...] "Heya" [...] and the {{album of the}} same name before vanishing from the music business. According to various accounts by band members and Fowley, in 1972 Markley had evaded imprisonment and kept a low-profile after an incident involving two underage girls. Markley sporadically contacted his former bandmates; however, Fowley recollected a conversation with Stallings in 1992: [...] "He [...] told me that Bob had been <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> rowing boat on a lake near Las Vegas - he was like a recluse. It got loose from its moorings and he drifted off alone for a day and a half. He was already pretty messed up, but he got very badly dehydrated. When they eventually found him he was taken to some hospital and placed on a life-support system, unable to speak or think". Markley died on September 9, 2003 in a hospital in Gardena, California; he was 68.|$|E
500|$|Lee later lamented: [...] "Malaysia — to whom does it belong? To Malaysians. But who are Malaysians? I hope I am, Mr Speaker, Sir. But sometimes, <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> chamber, I {{doubt whether}} I am {{allowed to be}} a Malaysian. This is the doubt that hangs over many minds, and ... {{emotions}} are set in motion, and men pitted against men along these unspoken lines, you will {{have the kind of}} warfare that will split the nation from top to bottom and undo Malaysia." [...] At times, however, Lee worsened things by making racial comments of his own. Many of his speeches harped on the ethnic composition of Malaysia, reminding listeners that the non-Malays were now in the majority, with 61% of the population to the Malays' 39% asking at one point, [...] "Why should we go back to old Singapore and once again reduce the non-Malays in Malaya to a minority?" [...] Lee exacerbated deteriorating PAP-UMNO relations by constantly demanding that the federal government [...] "smack down their 'ultras'", whose ranks included prominent UMNO leaders such as Syed Jaafar Albar and Syed Nasir Ismail.|$|E

2500|$|George Miller cites as {{an initial}} {{inspiration}} for the film an encounter with a grizzled old cameraman, whose father was Frank Hurley of the Shackleton expeditions, during the shooting of Mad Max 2: [...] "We were <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> bar, having a milkshake, and he looked across at me and said, ‘Antarctica.’ He’d shot a documentary there.

2500|$|The DAP contested {{a general}} {{election}} {{for the first time}} in 1969. In line with their commitment to equality, the DAP originally campaigned against Bumiputra privileges, such as those afforded to them by Article 153 of the Constitution. They also continued Lee Kuan Yew's campaign for a Malaysian Malaysia, the idea of which was originally conveyed by Lee in Parliament: [...] "Malaysia – to whom does it belong? To Malaysians. But who are Malaysians? I hope I am, Mr Speaker, Sir. But sometimes, <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> chamber, I doubt whether I am allowed to be a Malaysian." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lee also criticised the government's {{policies}} {{by stating}} that [...] "hey, the Malay, have the right as Malaysian citizens {{to go up to}} the level of training and education that the more competitive societies, the non-Malay society, has produced. That is what must be done, isn't it? Not to feed them with this obscurantist doctrine that all they have got to do is to get Malay rights for the few special Malays and their problem has been resolved." [...] He also lamented [...] "Malaysia—to whom does it belong? To Malaysians. But who are Malaysians? I hope I am, Mr Speaker, Sir. But sometimes, <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> chamber, I doubt whether I am allowed to be a Malaysian." ...|$|E

2500|$|In November 1837, in the lead-up to the Political Union's Constitutional Convention, Mackenzie {{published}} a satire in the Constitution, a round table discussion by such luminaries as John Locke, Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, Oliver Goldsmith and William Pitt and others, {{said to be}} a [...] "convention <b>sitting</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> township for the purpose of circulating political information, weighing opinions as to the best means of improving the civil institutions of the country, and endeavoring to determine whether the British Constitution, Sir F. Head's government or Independence would be the most likely to prove advantageous to the people." [...] As part of this satire, he {{published a}} draft republican constitution for Upper Canada. This constitution closely resembled the objectives spelled out in the constitution of the Canadian Alliance Society in 1834; [...] it called for an elected governor, legislative council (senate), House of Assembly and magistracy, all by secret ballot. It was egalitarian, prohibiting both slavery and the granting of [...] "hereditary emoluments, privileges, or honors." [...] It also called for a separation of church and state, and barred the clergy from seeking election, or serving in any civil or military office. It guaranteed the rights to personal property, to freedom of the press, and freedom of assembly. But tied to these rights to personal property and egalitarian democracy were severe restrictions on chartering corporations; starting from the premise that [...] "Labour is the only means of creating wealth" [...] it placed a constitutional prohibition on chartering either banks or trading companies.|$|E
