30|$|Injections of DER {{jeopardize}} the existing protection coordination schemes for the <b>distribution</b> <b>system.</b> Impact depends upon number, size, type {{and location of}} DER in the <b>distribution</b> <b>system.</b> Moreover, as the location of DER in <b>distribution</b> <b>system</b> varies, the configuration of <b>distribution</b> <b>systems</b> also changes. Generally, the <b>distribution</b> <b>systems</b> are radial in nature and over current based protection schemes are set for unidirectional flow of fault currents. Penetration of DER usually causes meshed configuration of <b>distribution</b> <b>systems</b> and on majority of distribution feeders, fault current flows in both the directions [4]. The protection schemes which are designed for unidirectional flow of fault currents fails to provide the adequate protection coordination when DER power is injected in the <b>distribution</b> <b>systems.</b> Moreover, there is a requirement of additional number of direction over current relays. The new settings of over current relays depend upon the location of new incoming DER in the <b>distribution</b> <b>systems.</b> In addition to these requirements, the impact may also reach to upstream transmission lines connected with downstream DER connected <b>distribution</b> <b>systems.</b> Under such operational conditions, the distance relays installed on the transmission line may result in underreact operation [8].|$|R

The importance {{and complexity of the}} phase reference <b>distribution</b> <b>systems</b> used in these accelerators have grown significantly during recent years. Amongst the most advanced of currently developed accelerators are projects based on the TESLA technology. These projects require synchronization of many RF devices with accuracy reaching femtosecond levels over kilometre distances. Design of a phase reference <b>distribution</b> <b>system</b> fulfilling such requirements is a challenging scientific task. There are many interdisciplinary problems which must be solved during the system design. Many, usually negligible issues, may became very important in such system. Furthermore, the design of a <b>distribution</b> <b>system</b> on a scale required for the TESLA technology based projects is a new challenge and there is almost no literature sufficiently covering this subject. This thesis is devoted to the conceptual analysis, design and realization of a complete phase reference <b>distribution</b> <b>system</b> for the FLASH accelerator. The most important design issues are considered. Important <b>distribution</b> <b>system</b> architectures are described with their advantages and disadvantages. Methods of characterization of signal phase instabilities in <b>distribution</b> <b>system</b> components are presented.
