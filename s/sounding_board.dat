5|$|Chordophones, {{which produce}} sound by {{vibrating}} {{one or more}} strings; they are sorted into according {{to the relationship between}} the string(s) and the <b>sounding</b> <b>board</b> or chamber. For example, if the strings are laid out parallel to the <b>sounding</b> <b>board</b> and there is no neck, the instrument is a zither whether it is plucked like an autoharp or struck with hammers like a piano. If the instrument has strings parallel to the <b>sounding</b> <b>board</b> or chamber and the strings extend past the board with a neck, then the instrument is a lute, whether the sound chamber is constructed of wood like a guitar or uses a membrane like a banjo.|$|E

5|$|Cinefantastiques Dale Kutzera {{thought the}} episode flowed well, {{and that the}} treknobabble was {{reasonable}} and logical, but that the episode didn't {{make good use of}} the characters. He said that each character fitted a certain role: Neelix was the jealous boyfriend, B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson) was the shoot-first Klingon, and Kes was the perky-looking alien <b>sounding</b> <b>board</b> for other characters. Furthermore, Kutzera felt that the themes of the episode were more appropriate for an early first-season episode, not being as pertinent or believable a year later. He gave the episode 2.5 out of 4 stars.|$|E

50|$|Electric lap steel guitars without <b>sounding</b> <b>boards</b> are {{considered}} to be solid-body instruments by some authorities, and not by others. This has a major effect on some claims of historical priority, as they predate the first models of solid-body electric guitar, which may otherwise be claimed to be the first commercially successful solid-body instruments. While noting this, it will be assumed that electric lap steels without <b>sounding</b> <b>boards</b> are solid-body instruments {{for the purposes of this}} article.|$|R
50|$|Though {{the purpose}} of sound holes is to help {{acoustic}} instruments project their sound more efficiently, the sound does not emanate solely (nor even mostly) from {{the location of the}} sound hole. The majority of sound emanates from the surface area of both <b>sounding</b> <b>boards,</b> with sound holes playing a part by allowing the <b>sounding</b> <b>boards</b> to vibrate more freely, and by allowing some of the vibrations which have been set in motion inside the instrument to travel outside the instrument.|$|R

She served both to test the player and to act as a mouthpiece for any questions Avellone thought should be asked about the Star Wars universe. Sara Kestelman voiced {{the character}}, with Kreia's casting being considered the most important of all the characters. Her name references Princess Leia of the original Star Wars trilogy, while her character design draws both on Palpatine's hood and Obi-Wan Kenobi's robes.|$|E
5|$|In 1736, a ferry {{began to}} operate, {{traveling}} from Shawnee between Shawnee Island and Depuy Island, then across the Delaware River to New Jersey. By 1740 Aaron Depuy was operating a store, and in 1753 {{he built a}} stone and log church used by ministers of the Dutch Reformed Church. The cornerstone of this church remains, {{now part of the}} Shawnee Presbyterian Church. The farming community grew steadily, using the river to transport produce. A post office was built in 1843, and a brick church was erected in 1853 on the foundation of the old stone and log church. Some of the original beams still remain, as well as the original <b>sounding</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E

50|$|While the Republican Party {{held the}} {{majority}} in the U.S. House of Representatives, Simpson often served as the Speaker Pro Tempore of the House, particularly during debates concerning controversial legislation, due to his command of House procedure. Simpson is known to have broken several <b>sounding</b> <b>boards</b> with the gavel while calling the House to order. This inspired Simpson to have a number of <b>sounding</b> <b>boards</b> produced in Idaho, which he presented to then Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert (R-IL) as a joke.

25|$|A gudok {{usually had}} three strings, {{two of them}} tuned in unison and played as a drone, the third tuned a fifth higher. All three strings {{were in the same}} plane at the bridge, so that a bow could make them all sound simultaneously.

25|$|Two {{days after}} making the comments, Imus issued a public apology. By that time, however, there were various calls for his dismissal, {{particularly}} from {{civil rights activists}} Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, who threatened to protest both CBS Radio and MSNBC (which aired a video simulcast of the program), and to boycott companies who advertised on the program. WFAN offered its hosts and listeners a <b>sounding</b> <b>board</b> for their own feelings and comments, which were both for and against his dismissal. Chris Russo, in particular, expressed his disappointment at Imus for waiting two days before retracting his comments.|$|E

Ghiglia was seven years Modigliani's senior, {{and it is likely}} that it was he who showed the young man the limits of his horizons in Livorno. Like all precocious teenagers, Modigliani preferred the company of older companions, and Ghiglia's role in his adolescence was to be a sympathetic ear as he worked himself out, principally in the convoluted letters that he regularly sent, and which survive today.|$|E

25|$|The Iowa Caucuses are {{the kickoff}} for the {{national}} presidential selection process. Iowa holds a powerful position in that process because it {{can serve as a}} <b>sounding</b> <b>board</b> for the strength of a candidate's campaign. A win in the Iowa Caucuses can validate a candidate or propel them from relative obscurity. In particular the Iowa Republican Caucuses hold the most power when either the GOP is not the party in the presidency or an incumbent is not on the ballot. As Iowa is the first state to cast its votes on the nominee the media often focus heavily on opinion polls from the state to determine which way Republican voters are leaning.|$|E
25|$|This {{critical}} acclaim notwithstanding, in 1947, {{after years of}} depression from his experiences in the war and a continuing bout of writer's block, March suffered a nervous breakdown. He briefly returned to Mobile to recuperate and made many return visits to New York to settle his affairs. On one such visit in 1949, March happened upon the gallery of New York art dealer Klaus Perls, which {{proved to be a}} turning point in March's life. Perls, accustomed to dealing with creative personalities, accepted March in a way March had not experienced since his days of therapy in London. Through Perls, March was able to talk openly about his creative process, using Perls as a <b>sounding</b> <b>board</b> for his ideas. Perls also introduced March to a world of other artists. In the works of Pablo Picasso and notably Chaim Soutine, March found a kinship and connection, as March and Soutine both displayed paranoid and schizophrenic tendencies. March returned Perls' friendship with a steady acquisition of works by Soutine, Joseph Glasco, Picasso, and Georges Rouault. March continued this friendship with routine visits to New York between 1949 and 1953, until ailing health prevented him from further travels.|$|E

25|$|In the Second World War {{the church}} and the {{adjoining}} parsonage in the Kettelerallee were damaged by several bomb hits. The church windows were destroyed in 1943 by the blast waves of bomb explosions nearby. The large main staircase at the tower was destroyed in 1944 by a bomb hit and the church roof of fire bombs. After rebuilding, the church interior from 1951 got a white coating on the walls with an orange-coloured ceiling. The new church windows were re-glazed in a yellowish hue. The two side altars were removed. In addition, there were a total of five side chapels in the church between the pillars in the inner church and the two side walls of the church ship. They were dedicated to various saints, such as Saint Elizabeth, Saint Rita and Saint Agnes. Behind the left front pillar was the entrance to the pulpit, which had a rectangular <b>sounding</b> <b>board.</b> The church was put under cultural heritage management in 1986 together with its location and the assignment to the Ernst May settlement around the church. In 1990 extensive renovations were begun, in which the altar area was redesigned and the interior was restored to its original color in 1992, also for reasons of cultural heritage management.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} {{was constructed in}} three sections to fulfill the established criteria. The first section, projecting outwards, had various workshops, cloakrooms and the foyer {{on the ground floor}} while upstairs it had a restaurant and a scenography studio. The second section housed the theatre proper. The boxes contained separate dressing rooms while the audience area was flat so that the hall could also be used as a ballroom. The third section, the stage, was designed in three sweeps with two lateral compartments large enough for backstage requirements. In his design for the horseshoe-shaped auditorium, Piermarini was inspired by the architecture of the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples but changed the degree of curvature so as to improve visibility and the acoustics. The acoustics were further enhanced by a number of subsequent modifications. For the ceiling, a finely decorated wooden facing served as a natural <b>sounding</b> <b>board,</b> ensuring almost perfect sound in every part of the hall. It was considered to be among the best of the times. Another little trick was to reduce significantly the size of the usually huge columns separating the various stages. For the hall's decor, Piermarini worked with prominent artists such as Giuseppe Levati and Giocondo Albertolli while also consulting the poet Giuseppe Parini. The theatre underwent many alterations during the Napoleonic period after which it lost its Neoclassical interiors as a result of work carried out by artists such as Francesco Hayez.|$|E
500|$|The {{historian}} Ben Hughes {{commented on}} the novel: [...] "The Liberator's British confidants, including Daniel O'Leary, were amongst the closest figures to the general in this period. Nevertheless, they are ignored in the novel. Instead, Márquez uses {{the character of a}} fictional Colombian servant, José Palacios, as The Liberator's final <b>sounding</b> <b>board,</b> thereby neatly sidestepping the more complex reality." [...] In Hughes's view modern South American literature has played a role in cleansing the national memory of British soldiers' assistance to The Liberator.|$|E
