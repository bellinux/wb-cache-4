25|$|Chickens {{are kept}} indoors {{but with more}} space (around 12 to 14 birds per square metre). They have a richer {{environment}} for example with natural light or <b>straw</b> <b>bales</b> that encourage foraging and perching.

The benefits of higher welfare indoor systems are the reduced growth rate, less crowding and more opportunities for natural behaviour.|$|E
40|$|<b>Straw</b> <b>bale</b> {{building}} is an environmentally friendly building technique {{that has not}} yet reached the broad masses of the population. This thesis seeks answers to why <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> building has not diffused more, using Everett M. Rogers renowned theory about diffusion of innovations. Qualitative research provides data about the attributes of this particular innovation, characteristics of early adopters of the innovation, as well as other aspects like communication channels and the social context, which could tell us something about why it has not become more popular. Perceptions and experiences about <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> building in Norway and Denmark are examined through eight interviews with both <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> builders and <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> experts. A comparative analysis of Norway and Denmark is also provided. The main findings are that <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> building s complexity, time- and labour-intensiveness, and its connection to an alternative lifestyle, are factors that are hindering the innovation s diffusion. There is also a lack of information and knowledge about it in society. The thesis argues that if <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> {{building is}} to become a viable option for a larger portion of the populations of Norway and Denmark, the reasonable way forward is its industrialization...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Ecological {{houses have}} become very popular lately due to an {{increasing}} concern regarding {{the reduction of the}} CO 2 emissions generated by the building sector. An ecological house is perceived as a building that enhances the environment rather than degrading it. <b>Straw</b> <b>bale</b> houses are considered to be an ecological and energy efficient solution to the traditional houses. The research aimed to evaluate the use of <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> in constructions. The experimental work included the mechanical and the hygrothermal behaviour of <b>straw</b> <b>bale,</b> i. e. compression test, moisture content and thermal conductivity determination on a <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> wall placed in climatic conditions specific for Romania. The research results show a better thermal performance than some of the traditional choices existing on the market. The study provides encouraging insight into considering <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> solutions as a first alternative to the classical ones...|$|R

Recent research has shown that moderate as well as complete confinement of plastered skins have been used on the <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> wall assemblies. This project will continue this investigation and will include the results of compressive tests of confined <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> specimens.

25|$|On 7 May 1967 Bandini {{was racing}} at the Monaco Grand Prix, running second to Denny Hulme on the 82nd lap, {{when he lost}} control of his car at the harbour chicane. He had just entered the chicane when his Ferrari's left rear wheel hit the guard rail, sending him into an erratic skid. It {{impacted}} a light pole and overturned. The car hit <b>straw</b> <b>bales</b> which lined the harbour side, rupturing the fuel tank, and sparks ignited the fuel as the car rolled over, with Bandini trapped beneath it. Marshals flipped his car upright and pulled Bandini, unconscious, out from the flaming Ferrari. It is thought that, during the effort to right the overturned car, fuel leaked on the hot brake line or the exhaust pipe and exploded. A second fire occurred when the fuel tank exploded after Bandini had been {{pulled away from the}} Ferrari.|$|E

Following nationalisation, electricity was provided by the East Midlands Electricity Board until it was privatised in 1990; in 1998, East Midlands Electricity, the privately owned predecessor company, was purchased by PowerGen.

500|$|As the Lotus 72 {{was not as}} {{effective}} as the team hoped, it was returned to the factory to be re-built and Rindt used the old Lotus 49 for the next race in Monaco. The necessity of using tyres intended for the new design made the older car unstable. Seemingly unaffected by this, Rindt produced what his race engineer Herbie Blash called [...] "the race of his life". From eighth on the grid, he worked his way through the field on a track notorious for presenting few overtaking opportunities. In the closing stages, he was second, steadily closing the gap on leader Jack Brabham. On the final lap, on the final corner, Brabham braked too late, touched the kerbstone and went straight ahead into the <b>straw</b> <b>bales,</b> allowing Rindt through to take his first victory of the season. Rindt used the Lotus 49 one last time at the Belgian Grand Prix, a race at which he heavily criticised the organisers for installing guardrails that had gaps of several metres between them. He had originally started practice in the remodelled 72, but the car came to a halt early in the session with a broken lower wishbone, forcing Rindt to switch cars once more. Despite engine troubles during the rest of practice, he managed to qualify on the front row, but later retired with another engine failure.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} the ability {{of different types of}} cereal plant straw to resist decay. Proponents of <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> building claim that bale buildings reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere in a number of ways. The carbon contained in straw is locked within the building structure and is therefore not emitted to the atmosphere. <b>Straw</b> <b>bale</b> buildings are also highly energy efficient in terms of both construction inputs and heating once inhabited, thereby saving energy that would otherwise by sourced primarily from fossil fuels. <b>Straw</b> <b>bale</b> buildings are part of a global movement to mitigate global warming through more eco-positive approaches to human development. In order for <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> buildings to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, they need to be sustainable – they need to last. Currently, there is some doubt in the building industry regarding the ability of <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> to resist decay in the long-term, particularly in temperate climates. Therefore, an ancillary {{aim of this}} research is to help <b>straw</b> <b>bale</b> builders make more durable buildings by attempting to identify a more rot-resistant type of straw.

40|$|Dwellings in a Mediterranean climate, {{such as that}} of Chile's Central Valley, {{must provide}} hygro-thermal comfort both during the cold winters, and the hot days and cool summer nights.
