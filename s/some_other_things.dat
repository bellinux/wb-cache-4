500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV, Halo developer Bungie's former content manager Frank O'Connor said that {{the inclusion of the}} Arbiter as a playable character in Halo2 {{was supposed to be a}} [...] "secret on the scale of a Shyamalan plot twist" [...] and explains that Bungie was able to keep the public uninformed about this until the game's release, to the point that O'Connor never even considered including it on the weekly development updates posted at Bungie's webpage. O'Connor also stated that Bungie [...] "had <b>some</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> that were secrets within secrets" [...] and claimed that there was material related to the Arbiter that was kept secret during the development of Halo3 because [...] "There is an aspect of the Arbiter's character that is still secret to this day and will remain so for a good reason." [...] Story director Joseph Staten said that the purpose of introducing the Arbiter was [...] "to offer another, compelling point of view on a war where telling friend from foe wasn't always clear-cut.

500|$|Another {{suggestion}} is that the Cheyenne warriors, pressed to recount details of the Custer battle, were still reluctant to admit to killing soldiers for fear of punishment. A simple {{way out of this}} dilemma was to say when questioned by non-Indians that most of the soldiers died at their own hands. Researchers Fox and Thom Hatch say that Wooden Leg retracted the claim in later life; this would have been in extreme old age, as he had still not recanted at the age of 73 when the book was written, other than to say it was whisky that was the cause rather than prayer. In his book Cheyenne Memories, John Stands In Timber, tribal historian for the Northern Cheyenne, agrees: [...] "Wooden Leg said <b>some</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> (in his book) he took back later. One was that the soldiers were drunk, and many killed themselves. I went with two army men to see him one time. They wanted to find out about it. I interpreted... and we asked him if it were true that the Indians said the soldiers did that. He laughed and said there were just too many Indians. The soldiers did their best. He said if they had been drunk they would not have killed as many as they did. But it was in the book." ...|$|E
