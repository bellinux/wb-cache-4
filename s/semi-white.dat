The soil below and from the cuttings themselves is kept moist, and should be aerated {{once in a while}} to prevent formation of molds.

40|$|Techniques for {{developing}} low-complexity, robust Digital Signal Processing (DSP) algo-rithms with low-power consumption {{have become increasingly}} important. This thesis ex-plores a framework, discrete-time randomized sampling, which allows the design of algo-rithms that meet some desired complexity, robustness or power constraints. Three distinct sampling schemes are presented based on randomized sampling of the input, of the filter im-pulse response, and iterative randomized sampling of the filter impulse response. Additive noise models are derived for each approach and error characteristics are analyzed for both white and colored sampling processes. It is shown that <b>semi-white</b> iterative randomized sampling leads to better error characteristics than white sampling through higher SNR as well as noise shaping. Discrete-time randomized sampling is then used as a filter approxima-tion method and conditions are derived under which a randomized sampling approximation to the Wiener filter is guaranteed to lead a smaller mean-square estimation error than the best constrained LTI approximation. A low-power formulation for randomized sampling is also given and the tradeoff between power consumption and output quality is examined an...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} case-control study, {{conducted}} in Serbia during the period 1998 - 2000, was to investigate whether diet {{was associated with the}} development of gastric cancer. The case group consisted of 131 patients with histologically confirmed gastric cancer, and the control group of 131 patients with orthopedics diseases and injuries. Cases and controls were individually matched by age (±± 2 years), gender, and place of residence. On the basis of multivariate logistic regression analysis, following factors were found as independent risk factors for gastric cancer: more frequent consumption of high-fat milk [Odds ratio (OR) = 1. 45, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0. 99 - 2. 16]; mutton, lamb and/or calf meat (OR = 2. 46, 95 % CI = 1. 11 - 5. 47), sugar (OR = 2. 13, 95 % CI = 1. 43 - 3. 18), <b>semi-white</b> bread (OR = 2. 09, 95 % CI = 1. 25 - 3. 50), and salting food (OR = 5. 72, 95 % CI = 2. 63 - 12. 42). Factors found as protective were: more frequent consumption of margarine (OR = 0. 41, 95 % CI = 0. 25 - 0. 69), „other“ cheeses (OR = 0. 47, 95 % CI = 0. 29 - 0. 77), and fish (OR = 0. 39, 95 % CI = 0. 19 - 0. 76) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{need for}} food that {{contributes}} to individual nutrition and health status, and also to the sustainability of the planet, is rising {{as a consequence of}} consumer’s awareness of foods nutritional value and origin. This behaviour is mostly expressed through the preference toward organically grown and wholesome food. Science to some extent supports this preference, giving more evidence supporting the benefit of whole food, and indicating that organic might be more nutritious than conventional. However, the question that remains is - is it always better? Thus in this study organic and conventional cereal milling products from Croatian market were randomly selected (namely wheat bran, whole grain, <b>semi-white</b> and white wheat flour, and whole grain corn, oat and rye flour) in order to determine their antioxidant activity (AO), lignans, ferulic acid (FA), total phenolic (TPC) and dietary fibre (DF) content. The research aimed to point out how cereals contribute to the diet with their fibres and bioactives, and to see to what extent consumers can expect organic cereal products to be better source of bioactives than conventional ones when buying from the market. Wheat bran distinguished among chosen products with its high FA, TPC, lignan content, and the strongest AO, especially in case of organic bran. Within whole grains organic corn flour exhibited the strongest AO and the highest TPC (2576 mg FAE kg- 1), while organic oat flour was the most abundant in lignans (10064 μg kg- 1). Higher content of FA, TPC, and lignans in organic wheat bran and established difference in bioactives between flours from the organic farming compared to conventional do not lead to firm conclusion that consumers can expect organically produced cereals to be superior in all nutrition aspects to conventional, as is often believed. Despite that, interestingly, among analysed nutritional parameters lignans were in all cases higher in organic products and less strong correlated to fibre content, indicating that they could be influenced by farming system. Obtained data highlight the benefit of consuming different wholegrain cereals as an important source of fibres and bioactive compounds, which, with the exception of lignans, are strongly positively correlated to the insoluble fibre content...|$|E
