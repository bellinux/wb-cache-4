5|$|Maine Coons {{have several}} {{physical}} adaptations for survival in harsh winter climates. Their dense water-resistant fur is longer and shaggier on their underside and rear for extra protection {{when they are}} walking or {{sitting on top of}} wet surfaces of snow or ice. Their long and bushy raccoon-like tail is resistant to sinking in <b>snow,</b> <b>and</b> can be curled around their face and shoulders for warmth and protection from wind and blowing <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> it can even be curled around their backside like an insulated seat cushion when sitting down on a snow or ice surface. Large paws, and especially the extra-large paws of polydactyl Maine Coons, facilitate walking on <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> are often compared to snowshoes. Long tufts of fur growing between their toes help keep the toes warm and further aid walking on snow by giving the paws additional structure without significant extra weight. Heavily furred ears with extra long tufts of fur growing from inside help keep their ears warm.|$|E

5|$|Cross-country skiing has {{two basic}} {{propulsion}} techniques, which apply to different surfaces: classic (undisturbed <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> tracked <b>snow)</b> <b>and</b> skate skiing (firm, smooth snow surfaces). The classic technique {{relies on a}} wax or texture on the ski bottom under the foot for traction on the snow to allow the skier to slide the other ski forward in virgin or tracked snow. With the skate skiing technique a skier slides on alternating skis on a firm snow surface at an angle {{from each other in}} a manner similar to ice skating. Both techniques employ poles with baskets that allow the arms to participate in the propulsion. Specialized equipment is adapted to each technique and each type of terrain. A variety of turns are used, when descending.|$|E

5|$|High {{altitude}} sections {{subject to}} <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> ice have yellow lane markings and red reflector posts (which are sometimes {{double or triple}} height); {{in contrast to the}} white lines and posts generally seen elsewhere around Australia. It is recommended that snow chains are carried for all two-wheel drive vehicles travelling on this highway within Kosciuszko National Park during the winter months.|$|E
5|$|In road <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> ice control, brine {{is often}} used as an anti-icer rather than a de-icer. A vehicle carries a tank of brine, which is sprayed on the road surface before or {{at the onset of}} the storm. This keeps <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> ice from {{adhering}} to the surface and makes mechanical removal by plows easier. Solid salt is also wetted with brine or other liquid deicer. This speeds de-icing action and helps keep it from bouncing off the pavement into the gutter or ditch. Brine acts faster than solid salt and does not require compression by passing traffic to become effective. The brine is also more environmentally friendly, as less salt is required to treat the same length of road.|$|E
5|$|In some areas, {{people use}} weather {{forecasts}} {{to determine what}} to wear on a given day. Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> the wind chill, forecasts {{can be used to}} plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead to survive through them.|$|E

5|$|In {{the cases}} of Lake-effect <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> polar lows, the {{convective}} systems form over warm water bodies when cold air sweeps over their surface and leads {{to an increase in}} moisture and significant vertical motion. This vertical motion leads to the development of showers and thunderstorms in areas of cyclonic flow on the backside of extratropical cyclones.|$|E

5|$|Shocks of magnitude3.2 {{or greater}} {{occurred}} at a slightly increasing rate during April and May with five earthquakes of magnitude4 or above per day in early April, and eightperday the week before May 18. Initially there was no direct sign of eruption, but small earthquake-induced avalanches of <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> ice were reported from aerial observations.|$|E
5|$|Snow {{interacts with}} {{vegetation}} in two principal ways, vegetation {{can influence the}} deposition and retention of <b>snow</b> <b>and,</b> conversely, the presence of snow can affect the distribution and growth of vegetation. Tree branches, especially of conifers intercept falling <b>snow</b> <b>and</b> prevent accumulation on the ground. Snow suspended in trees ablates more rapidly than that on the ground, owing to its greater exposure to sun and air movement. Trees and other plants can also promote snow retention on the ground, which would otherwise be blown elsewhere or melted by the sun. Snow affects vegetation in several ways, the presence of stored water can promote growth, yet the annual onset of growth {{is dependent on the}} departure of the snowpack for those plants that are buried beneath it. Furthermore, avalanches and erosion from snowmelt can scour terrain of vegetation.|$|E
