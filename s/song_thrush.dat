5|$|B.: Throstle is a colloquial Black Country {{name for}} the <b>song</b> <b>thrush.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>song</b> <b>thrush</b> is {{not usually}} gregarious, {{although}} several birds may roost together in winter or be loosely associated in suitable feeding habitats, perhaps with other thrushes such as the blackbird, fieldfare, redwing and dark-throated thrush. Unlike the more nomadic fieldfare and redwing, the <b>song</b> <b>thrush</b> tends to return regularly to the same wintering areas.|$|E
5|$|The <b>song</b> <b>thrush</b> is omnivorous, {{eating a}} wide range of invertebrates, {{especially}} earthworms and snails, as well as soft fruit and berries. Like its relative, the blackbird, the <b>song</b> <b>thrush</b> finds animal prey by sight, has a run-and-stop hunting technique on open ground, and will rummage through leaf-litter seeking potential food items.|$|E

50|$|A Russian {{study of}} blood parasites showed {{that all the}} fieldfares, redwings and <b>song</b> <b>thrushes</b> sampled carried haematozoans, {{particularly}} Haemoproteus and Trypanosoma.|$|R
500|$|... in Great Britain <b>song</b> <b>thrushes</b> are {{commonly}} found {{where there are}} trees and bushes. Such areas include parks, gardens, coniferous and deciduous woodland and hedgerows.|$|R
5|$|The <b>song</b> <b>thrush</b> is {{occasionally}} {{a host of}} parasitic cuckoos, such as the common cuckoo, but this is very rare because the thrush recognizes the cuckoo's non-mimetic eggs. However, the <b>song</b> <b>thrush</b> does not demonstrate the same aggression toward the adult cuckoo that is shown by the blackbird. The introduced birds in New Zealand, where the cuckoo does not occur, have, over the past 130years, retained the ability to recognise and reject non-mimetic eggs.|$|E
5|$|The grove Snail (Cepaea nemoralis) is {{regularly}} eaten by the <b>song</b> <b>thrush,</b> and its polymorphic shell patterns {{have been suggested}} as evolutionary responses to reduce predation; however, song thrushes {{may not be the}} only selective force involved.|$|E
5|$|The <b>song</b> <b>thrush</b> has an {{extensive}} range, estimated at 10millionsquare kilometres (3.8million square miles), {{and a large}} population, with an estimated 40 to 71million individuals in Europe alone.|$|E
50|$|The site in {{the middle}} of a {{residential}} area has grassland, scrub and a pond with invertebrates such as frogs and newts. Birds include <b>song</b> <b>thrushes.</b>|$|R
50|$|With such an {{abundance}} of habitat, the Forest attracts many birds such as nuthatches, treecreepers, mistle <b>thrushes,</b> tawny owls, <b>song</b> <b>thrushes,</b> great spotted woodpeckers and chaffinches.|$|R
500|$|The <b>song</b> <b>thrush's</b> {{characteristic}} <b>song,</b> with melodic phrases repeated twice or more, {{is described}} by the nineteenth-century British poet Robert Browning in his poem Home Thoughts, from Abroad: ...|$|R
5|$|An {{individual}} male {{may have}} a repertoire of more than 100phrases, many copied from its parents and neighbouring birds. Mimicry may include the imitation of man-made items like telephones, and the <b>song</b> <b>thrush</b> will also repeat the calls of captive birds, including exotics such as the white-faced whistling duck.|$|E
5|$|Birds of the {{nominate}} subspecies {{were introduced}} to New Zealand and Australia by acclimatisation societies between 1860 and 1880, apparently for purely sentimental reasons. In New Zealand, where it was introduced on both the main islands, the <b>song</b> <b>thrush</b> quickly established itself and spread to surrounding islands such as the Kermadecs, Chatham and Auckland Islands. Although it is common and widespread in New Zealand, in Australia only a small population survives around Melbourne. In New Zealand, {{there appears to be}} a limited detrimental effect on some invertebrates due to predation by introduced bird species, and the <b>song</b> <b>thrush</b> also damages commercial fruit crops in that country. As an introduced species it has no legal protection in New Zealand, and can be killed at any time.|$|E
5|$|The <b>song</b> <b>thrush</b> (Turdus philomelos) is a thrush that breeds {{across much}} of Eurasia. It has brown upperparts and black-spotted cream or buff underparts and has three {{recognised}} subspecies. Its distinctive song, which has repeated musical phrases, has frequently been referred to in poetry.|$|E
50|$|The park centres on Daventry Reservoir, which {{feeds the}} Grand Union Canal, {{and there are}} also meadows and crack willow woodland. Birds include yellowhammers, lesser whitethroats, dunnocks and <b>song</b> <b>thrushes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{black rat}} is {{considered}} to be the major predator of this species and likely to be a significant threat to its survival. European blackbirds and <b>song</b> <b>thrushes</b> (self-introduced around 1950) are also thought to be predators of the snail.|$|R
50|$|The {{site has}} a wildlflower meadow, coppiced woodland, {{grassland}} and a pond. Flowers {{in the meadow}} include hoary cress, charlock and ox-eye daisy, {{and there are many}} species of butterflies. The woodland has birds such as dunnock and <b>song</b> <b>thrushes.</b>|$|R
5|$|The <b>song</b> <b>thrush</b> is {{the emblem}} of West Bromwich Albion Football Club, chosen because the public house in which the team used to change kept a pet thrush in a cage. It also gave rise to Albion's early nickname, The Throstles.|$|E
5|$|Up to {{at least}} the nineteenth century the <b>song</b> <b>thrush</b> was kept as a cage bird because of its melodious voice. As with hunting, there is little {{evidence}} that the taking of wild birds for aviculture has had a significant effect on wild populations.|$|E
5|$|The <b>song</b> <b>thrush</b> breeds in forests, {{gardens and}} parks, and is {{partially}} migratory with many birds wintering in southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East; {{it has also}} been introduced into New Zealand and Australia. Although it is not threatened globally, there have been serious population declines in parts of Europe, possibly due to changes in farming practices.|$|E
50|$|The <b>song</b> of Naumann's <b>thrush</b> {{may differ}} from the simple fluted or {{whistling}} redwing-like <b>song</b> of dusky <b>thrush.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{site is a}} {{grassland}} remnant on chalk soil, and {{a remnant}} of flower-rich meadows in the area. Flora include common spotted-orchids, ox-eye daisys and bird's foot trefoils. There are fauna such as <b>song</b> <b>thrushes</b> and marbled white butterflies. Hedgerows provide and additional habitat.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{studying}} post-fledging survival rates from data on national ringing recoveries. The approach extends the classical two-age-class models of Brownie et al. (1985) to include a third age-class of birds ringed as nestlings. The models can incorporate age-class-specific and year-specific variation in reporting rates and survival rates. Unlike intensive resighting studies at single sites, this approach does not confound death with emigration and provides estimates of survival which are representative of a larger geographical area. We implemented the models with SURVIV software, using likelihood-ratio tests to assess the significance of possible age and year effects art survival rates or reporting rates. We demonstrate this approach using a set of data an British-ringed <b>Song</b> <b>Thrushes</b> Turdus philomelos. In this case, {{we were unable to}} detect any age-class-specific or year-specific variation in reporting rates and, although the survival rates of first-year and adult <b>Song</b> <b>Thrushes</b> varied significantly between years, post-fledgling survival did not show any detectable inter- annual variation. <b>Song</b> <b>Thrushes</b> ringed as nestlings had a 0. 38 chance (95 % CI = 0. 30 - 0. 45) of surviving the 63 -day post- fledging period (here defined as the period separating the average dates of birds ringed as nestlings and birds ringed as independent first-year birds).

5|$|A survey {{completed}} in November 2009 found 50 types {{of trees in}} the gardens. Bats {{were found in the}} coach house during an ecological survey, but were not believed to be roosting there long-term. Species of birds observed in the gardens have included <b>song</b> <b>thrush,</b> jay, wren, robin, kingfisher and tawny owl. Mammals regularly observed include hedgehogs, grey squirrels and foxes. Butterflies including the holly blue and painted lady have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|The <b>song</b> <b>thrush</b> breeds {{in most of}} Europe (although not in {{the greater}} part of Iberia, lowland Italy or {{southern}} Greece), and across the Ukraine and Russia almost to Lake Baikal. It reaches to 75°N in Norway, but only to about 60°N in Siberia. Birds from Scandinavia, Eastern Europe and Russia winter around the Mediterranean, North Africa and the Middle East, but only some of the birds in the milder west of the breeding range leave their breeding areas.|$|E
5|$|The <b>song</b> <b>thrush</b> {{has three}} subspecies, with the {{nominate}} subspecies, T. p. philomelos, covering {{the majority of}} the species' range. T. p. hebridensis, described by British ornithologist William Eagle Clarke in 1913, is a mainly sedentary (non-migratory) form found in the Outer Hebrides and Isle of Skye in Scotland. It is the darkest subspecies, with a dark brown back, greyish rump, pale buff background colour to the underparts and grey-tinged flanks.|$|E
5|$|Hedgerows of {{hawthorn}} and blackthorn, {{which form}} {{the boundaries between}} the fields, are the principal habitat in these cultivated areas. They support many species of wild flowers, insects and birds, including dog rose, purple foxglove and wild violet as well as wrens, blackbirds and <b>song</b> <b>thrushes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{wood was}} planted by the Duke of Bedford {{in the middle}} of the eighteenth century. It is ancient {{semi-natural}} woodland of beech, larch and poplar. Ground flora include wood anemone and nettle leaved bellflower, and there are birds such as great spotted woodpeckers and <b>song</b> <b>thrushes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The area {{is deemed}} {{important}} {{as it is}} inhabited by the second-largest roost of hen harriers in Europe; a bird that descends on the area during the winter months. Other birds include peregrine falcons, merlins, robins, willow warblers, <b>song</b> <b>thrushes</b> and dunnocks among others. There is also a subspecies of wren, possibly unique to the Isle.|$|R
5|$|The <b>song</b> <b>thrush</b> {{typically}} nests {{in forest}} with good undergrowth and nearby more open areas, and in western Europe also uses gardens and parks. It breeds {{up to the}} tree-line, reaching 2,200metres (7,250ft) in Switzerland. The island subspecies T. p. hebridensis breeds in more open country, including heathland, and in {{the east of the}} song thrush's Eurasian range, the nominate subspecies is restricted {{to the edge of the}} dense conifer forests.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduced}} common blackbird is, {{together with}} the native silvereye (Zosterops lateralis), the most widely distributed avian seed disperser in New Zealand. Introduced there along with the <b>song</b> <b>thrush</b> (Turdus philomelos) in 1862, it has spread throughout the country up to an elevation of , as well as outlying islands such as the Campbell and Kermadecs. It eats {{a wide range of}} native and exotic fruit, and makes a major contribution to the development of communities of naturalised woody weeds. These communities provide fruit more suited to non-endemic native birds and naturalised birds, than to endemic birds.|$|E
5|$|The {{mistle thrush}} is much larger, paler and longer-tailed than the {{sympatric}} <b>song</b> <b>thrush.</b> In the western Himalayas {{it could be}} confused with both the plain-backed and the long-tailed thrushes. These {{are similar to the}} mistle thrush, but the plain–backed thrush lacks obvious wing bars, is more rufous above than its relative, and is barred rather than spotted below. The long-tailed thrush has olive-toned upperparts, bars on its breast and two wing bars. Juvenile mistle thrushes are superficially similar to White's thrush, but that species has golden-yellow plumage, scalloped underparts and a distinctive underwing pattern.|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} acid grassland, {{woodland}} and a pond. Flowers include common violets and enchanter's nightshade, {{and there are}} displays of bluebells in the spring. The woodland is mainly oak, ash and sycamore. The margin of the pond has yellow flag and flote grass. Wildlife includes nutchatches, <b>song</b> <b>thrushes,</b> purple hairstreak butterflies, yellow meadow ants and pipistrelle bats.|$|R
5000|$|One method, used {{especially}} by vertebrate molluscivores, {{is to break}} the shell, either by exerting force on the shell until it breaks, often by biting the shell, like with oyster crackers, mosasaurs, and placodonts, or hammering at the shell, e.g. oystercatchers and crabs, or by simply dashing the mollusc on a rock (e.g. <b>song</b> <b>thrushes,</b> gulls, and sea otters).|$|R
5|$|A recent {{molecular}} {{study indicates}} that the <b>song</b> <b>thrush's</b> closest relatives are the similarly plumaged mistle thrush (T. viscivorus) and Chinese thrush (T. mupinensis); these three species are early offshoots from the lineage of Turdus thrushes before they diversified and spread across the globe, and hence are less closely related to other European thrush species such as the blackbird (T. merula).|$|R
