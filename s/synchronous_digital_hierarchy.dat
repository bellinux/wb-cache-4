In DCS-based mesh architectures, telecommunications carriers deployed restoration systems for DS3 circuits such as at&t FASTAR (FAST Automatic Restoration) and MCI Real Time Restoration (RTR), restoring circuits in minutes after a network failure. In SONET/SDH rings, carriers implemented ring protection such as SONET Unidirectional Path Switched Ring (UPSR) (also called Sub-Network Connection Protection (SCNP) in SDH networks) or SONET Bidirectional Line Switched Ring (BLSR) (also called Multiplex Section - Shared Protection Ring (MS-SPRing) in SDH networks), protecting against and {{recovering from a}} network failure in 50 ms or less, a significant improvement over the recovery time supported in DCS-based mesh restoration, and a key driver for the deployment of SONET/SDH ring-based protection.|$|R

The need for efficient resource utilization has motivated {{the development of}} various protocols and techniques that offer data services over legacy backbone networks such as <b>Synchronous</b> Optical Network/Synchronous <b>Digital</b> <b>Hierarchy</b> (SONET/SDH). Enabling improved utilization with enhanced network reliability requires various network optimizations, both at the protocol and system levels. In this dissertation, we present a set of network optimization techniques that improve the performance of an end-user connected to classical packet networks such as Internet. First, we introduce an efficient path selection algorithm that enables seamless bandwidth upgrade for an existing Ethernet connection over SONET/SDH backbone using virtual concatenation technique. We also provide a heterogenous concatenation technique that improves the bandwidth utilization and that is easy to maintain. Second, we present a novel failure localization technique, that can detect single-link or simultaneous multiple-link failures. This technique is based on constructing a set of monitoring paths and cycles from one or more monitoring locations in the network. Third, we present an efficient routing and wavelength assignment scheme for backbone networks with stale network-state information. Finally, we present an eÂ±cient server placement scheme for supporting multiple-description-coding (MDC) based media streaming over content delivery networks.
