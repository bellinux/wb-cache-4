500|$|Cher has six tattoos. The Baltimore Sun {{called her}} the [...] "Ms. Original Rose Tattoo". She {{got her first}} tattoo in 1972. According to Sonny Bono, [...] "Calling her {{butterfly}} tattoos nothing was like ignoring a sandstorm in the Mojave. That was exactly the effect Cher wanted to create. She liked {{to do things for}} the shock they created. <b>She</b> <b>still</b> <b>does.</b> She'll create some controversy and then tell her critics to stick it." [...] In the late 1990s, she began having laser treatments to remove her tattoos. The process was still underway in the 2000s. She commented, [...] "When I got tattooed, only bad girls did it: me and Janis Joplin and biker chicks. Now it doesn't mean anything. No one's surprised."

Her confusion represents her lack of self-confidence, her fear that <b>she</b> <b>still</b> <b>does</b> not fit in or have a place in the world, unlike those around her, who are competent and know what is going on. She wears ordinary clothes, but the others repeatedly comment on the excellence of her [...] "costume", a reference to her fear that her friends do not see what she has grown into, but rather what she was when younger: nerdy and awkward. This fear is confirmed when Buffy strips off her shirt and jeans, revealing the same unfashionable turtleneck and corduroy jumper she wore in episode one of the series, four years earlier, before her demon-fighting experiences and study of magic increased her confidence and competence. Willow stands anxiously {{at the front of the}} class, trying to read a paper, while her classmates express their boredom with listening to her and Oz whispers into Tara's ear, until she is attacked by the First Slayer and her breath is sucked out of her body.|$|E
500|$|Sanctuary {{was mostly}} filmed on virtual green screen sets. Initially Tapping went through {{what she called}} [...] "chroma key green headaches" [...] because she had to stare at nothing but bright green walls {{for the first few}} days.

They also wanted Magnus to feel more angry and vulnerable throughout the season, especially in the first three episodes. After playing Magnus in the series' third season, Tapping admitted that <b>she</b> <b>still</b> <b>does</b> not get Magnus because [...] "there's so many things about the decisions that she makes that I still can't wrap my head around, and to me that's fascinating as an actor, to try to get inside somebody so complex and so kind of confusing." [...] In the episode [...] "Normandy", Tapping wore a red-haired wig for Magnus during her time in the Second World War, as an homage to her late grandmother. For the fourth season, Tapping requested that Magnus would be given a new love interest. The request was granted {{in the form of a}} female virologist appearing early in the season (thus establishing Magnus's bisexuality).|$|E
2500|$|The tour {{received}} positive reviews, with Craig Seymour from Buffalo News writing [...] "her All for You tour marked another milestone for {{the veteran}} artist, who {{proved to be}} more comfortable with own ability to command an audience than ever before."

2500|$|Stiffelio confronts Raffaele {{and asks}} {{him what he}} would do if Lina were free, {{offering}} him a choice between [...] "a guilty freedom" [...] and [...] "the future of the woman you have destroyed".

Stiffelio lays out the reason that their marriage can be annulled (Opposto è il calle che in avvenire - [...] "Opposite are the paths that in future our lives will follow"). Lina's reaction, when presented with the divorce decree, is to swear an ongoing love for her husband ("I will die for love of you").

2500|$|Within the series, Maggie's {{relationship}} with Henry soon ends, but {{the character is}} not heavily romantically linked with any other man for months and Maggie's {{relationship with}} Bianca continues to deepen. Hendrickson was perplexed by this aspect. [...] "Maggie was asexual for a long time. It was frustrating, and I was getting confused how I should play it," [...] said Hendrickson. [...] "So I kept it honest: She loved Bianca as a friend. There was a possibility that she could love her more intimately. <b>She</b> <b>still</b> <b>does</b> love her, {{and there was a}} point in time when she might have thought otherwise. But ultimately she likes men." [...] Despite Hendrickson's early views about the character's sexual orientation, the show continued to showcase Maggie sending [...] "mixed signals" [...] to Bianca, with her romantic feelings for Bianca coming through as intense. The character is shown to resort to having sex with good guy and best friend Jamie Martin on several occasions to bury these feelings, though most of her sexual interaction with Jamie takes place offscreen. Maggie's romantic attraction to Bianca finally gets the better of her, and she impulsively kisses her. Maggie panics, however, and tells Bianca it meant nothing. Heartbroken, she finds comfort in Jamie.|$|E
