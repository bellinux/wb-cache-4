40|$|Skin {{has been}} paid {{attention}} as a site of application of prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs (non-prescription drugs) and cosmetics. Skin permeation and <b>skin</b> concentration <b>of</b> the compounds should be considered after topical administration, {{as well as their}} blood concentration to evaluate efficacy and safety. Since the evaluation of the amount of drugs permeated through skin is important for topically applied drugs, studies on the skin permeation has been greatly advanced. In addition, many reports proved that <b>skin</b> permeabilities <b>of</b> drugs could be predicted from physicochemical parameters of drugs. On the other hand, few reports have been found on the prediction <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> concentration <b>of</b> drugs. Furthermore, many experimented problems are left to determine the <b>skin</b> concentration <b>of</b> drugs: severe consume of human or animal <b>skins,</b> difficult removal <b>of</b> applied drugs from the skin surface, low drug extraction ratio from skin and low sensitivity to determine <b>skin</b> concentration <b>of</b> drugs, and requirement of long time measurement. Thus, fast and accurate measurement <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> concentration <b>of</b> applied drugs are urgently required. This report describes the relationship between skin permeation and skin concentration, and the prediction <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> concentration <b>of</b> drugs using <b>skin</b> permeation parameters <b>of</b> drugs. 本総説は、日本薬学会第 132 年会シンポジウムS 01 で発表したものを中心に記述したものである...|$|R
5|$|Another rare {{complication}} {{that may}} occur early during warfarin treatment (usually within 3 to 8 weeks of commencement) is purple toe syndrome.

5|$|No fossil {{evidence}} of Dimetrodons skin {{has yet been}} found. Impressions of the <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> a related animal, Estemmenosuchus, indicate {{that it would have}} been smooth and well-provided with glands.

5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are also}} found in hairless areas (glabrous <b>skin)</b> <b>of</b> the eyelids, nose, penis, labia minora, the inner mucosal {{membrane}} of the cheek, and nipples. Some sebaceous glands have unique names. Sebaceous glands on the lip and mucosa of the cheek, and on the genitalia, are known as Fordyce spots, and glands on the eyelids are known as meibomian glands. Sebaceous glands of the breast are also known as Montgomery's glands.|$|E
5|$|The adult plumage is {{a uniform}} black, with the {{exception}} of a frill of white feathers nearly surrounding the base of the neck and, especially in the male, large patches or bands of white on the wings which do not appear until the completion of the bird's first moulting. The head and neck are red to blackish-red and have few feathers. The head and neck are meticulously kept clean by the bird, and their baldness is an adaptation for hygiene, allowing the skin to be exposed to the sterilizing effects of dehydration and ultraviolet light at high altitudes. The crown of the head is flattened. In the male, the head is crowned with a dark red caruncle or comb, while the <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> his neck lies in folds, forming a wattle. The <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> the head and neck is capable of flushing noticeably in response to emotional state, which serves to communicate between individuals. Juveniles have a grayish-brown general coloration, blackish head and neck skin, and a brown ruff.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Biothermomechanics <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> {{tissue is}} highly interdisciplinary, {{involving}} bioheat transfer, burn damage, biomechanics and physiology. Characterization of the thermomechanical behaviour <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> tissue is <b>of</b> great importance and {{can contribute to}} a variety of medical applications. However, few quantitative studies have been conducted on the temperature dependent mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> tissue. This paper reports the tensile and compressive behaviours <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> tissue under different temperatures and discusses the effect of temperature and corresponding dermal collagen denaturation on the mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> tissue. The results show that temperature has great influence on both the tensile and compressive properties <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> tissue, but the mechanisms are different. The variation <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> tensile properties is caused by the thermal denaturation <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> collagen with increasing temperature, while the variation <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> compressive behaviour <b>of</b> <b>skin</b> tissue is maybe due to the hydration change with thermal denaturation.

5|$|The condor's {{head and}} neck have few feathers, and the <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> the {{head and neck}} is capable of {{flushing}} noticeably in response to emotional state, a capability that can serve as communication between individuals.

5|$|The olive sea snake, Aipysurus laevis, {{has been}} found to have photoreceptors in the <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> its tail, {{allowing}} it to detect light and presumably ensuring it is completely hidden, including its tail, inside coral holes during the day. While other species have not been tested, Aipysurus laevis possibly is not unique among sea snakes in this respect.|$|E

5|$|The sebaceous glands {{of a human}} fetus secrete a {{substance}} called vernix caseosa, a waxy, translucent white substance coating the <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> newborns.

5|$|The <b>skin</b> <b>of</b> {{the adult}} cane toad is toxic, {{as well as}} the {{enlarged}} parotoid glands behind the eyes, and other glands across their backs.

When it is resting after a meal, absorption through the skin can drop to 3% of its total oxygen uptake.|$|E
