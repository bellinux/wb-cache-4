40|$|Following the {{literature}} on the comparative advantage of small versus large banks at lending to small businesses and in light of the worldwide {{decline in the number of}} intermediaries that specialise in this type of lending associated with deregulation in the banking industry, we examine the role that specific categories of banks have played in the context of Italy's regional economic growth. Over the estimation period, 1970 - 1993, which ends in the year of full implementation of the banking reform that introduced statutory de-specialisation and branching liberalisation, Italy featured not only a substantial presence of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the real sector, as is still the case, but also a large and heterogeneous set of <b>credit</b> <b>institutions</b> with different ownership, size and lending styles. Exploiting these peculiarities we study the role of specific intermediaries and gather indirect evidence concerning the likely effects, ceteris paribus, of the current consolidation processes. The main findings, stemming from panel regressions with fixed effects, are as follows. The overall size of the financial sector has a weak impact on growth, but some intermediaries are better than others: cooperative banks and <b>special</b> <b>credit</b> <b>institutions</b> play a positive role, banks of national interest (basically large private banks) and public law banks (government-owned banks) either do not affect growth or have a negative influence depending on how growth is measured. Cooperative banks were mostly small banks and <b>special</b> <b>credit</b> <b>institutions</b> were all but large conglomerates with standardized credit policies, hence our results lend support to the current worldwide concerns of a reduction in the availability of credit to SMEs resulting from consolidation and regulatory reforms in the banking industry...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to assess factors that {{influence}} loan repayment performance of DBE’s floriculture borrowers. The study used data collected from individual farm files of fifty four floriculture borrowers of DBE. The study shows that 52 % of the borrowers were defaulters, whereas, the remaining 48 % were nondefaulters. Probit model was used to identify variables which determine loan repayment performance. Educational status, sustainable floriculture certification status and farming experience of growers were statistically significant factors affecting repayment offloriculture loan of DBE. The analysis of partial marginal effect shows that sustainable floriculture certification {{is the most important}} factor among the other three variables. The policy implications of the study are: educating all floriculture growers on the importance of being certified with a multitude of standards in the form of certification schemes, codes ofpractice and a handful of consumer labels so that they can adopt those standards which best meet customer needs, intensifying supervision work in order to provide information and technical assistance for the established project, and improving customer recruitment system to emphasize on educational status of borrowers and farming experience of project managers deserve <b>special</b> attention. Finally, <b>credit</b> <b>institutions</b> or lending agencies should evaluate the factors that significantly influence loan repayment before granting loans to floriculture farms to reduce loan defaults...|$|R

40|$|Buying a {{piece of}} real estate is a very {{important}} decision. A real estate loan from a <b>credit</b> <b>institution</b> or a bank is a common way of financing such a purchase. The real estate loan in this study is defined as a product that consists of or is connected to service activities. Just as the <b>credit</b> <b>institutions</b> have demands and requirements on the loan applicants can those that apply also have certain demands and requirements that need to be fulfilled in order for the to be satisfied. This gives the customers an opportunity to “shop around” for the <b>credit</b> <b>institution</b> that offers the best deal regarding interest rates, level of service and/or terms of the loan agreement. The challenge for <b>credit</b> <b>institutions</b> becomes to distinguish themselves in a business where the difference between the product and the services are very slight. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the consumers’ selection of <b>credit</b> <b>institution</b> from which to acquire a real estate loan. A qualitative pre-study was made for this study in the form of interviews. These acted as the foundation for the main research method of the study, a quantitative survey study. The choice of method was based on the desire to investigate the behavior of a large group. Customers generally acquire real estate loans from a <b>credit</b> <b>institution</b> that has a friendly image and is attentive to the needs of the customers. The behavior of personnel is particularly important since the customers demand and has expectations on the way service personnel should act.
