During its use, a sealed radioactive waste will eventually become either a spent sealed source or disused <b>sealed</b> <b>radioactive</b> <b>source</b> (DSRS), due to certain factors. The reduction of the amount of radioactive waste can be executed through the application of reuse and recycle of sealed source.

40|$|A State {{that has}} signed an {{agreement}} with the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) authorizing the State to regulate certain uses of radioactive materials within the State. Atomic energy The energy that is released through a nuclear reaction or radioactive decay process. Of particular interest is the process known as fission, which occurs in a nuclear reactor and produces energy, usually in the form of heat. In a nuclear power plant, this heat is used to boil water to produce steam {{that can be used to}} drive large turbines. This, in turn, activates generators to produce electrical power. Atomic energy is more correctly called nuclear energy. Background radiation The natural radiation that is always present in the environment. It includes cosmic radiation that comes from the sun and stars, terrestrial radiation that comes from the Earth, and internal radiation that exists in all living things. The typical average individual exposure in the United States from natural background sources is about 300 millirems per year. Boiling-water reactor (BWR) A common nuclear power reactor design in which water flows upward through the core, where it is heated by fission and allowed to boil in the reactor vessel. The resulting steam then drives turbines, which activate generators to produce electrical power. BWRs operate similarly to electrical plants using fossil fuel, except that the BWRs are powered by 370 – 800 nuclear fuel assemblies in the reactor core. Brachytherapy A nuclear medicine procedure during which a <b>sealed</b> <b>radioactive</b> <b>source</b> is implanted directly into a person being treated for cancer (usually of the mouth, breast, lung, prostate, ovaries, or uterus). The radioactive implant may be temporary or permanent, and the radiation attacks the tumor as long as the device remains in place.

40|$|Executive summary Introduction The Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management {{and on the}} Safety of Radioactive Waste Management {{was adopted}} on 29 September 1997 at the Vienna Diplomatic Conference. Finland signed the Convention on 2 October 1997 and {{deposited}} the tools of acceptance on 10 February 2000. The Convention entered into force on 18 June 2001. This report is the 6 th Finnish National Report under the Joint Convention {{in accordance with the}} provisions of Article 32. It will be subject to review in May 2018 in the sixth Review Meeting of the contracting parties in Vienna. The fulfilment of the obligations of the Convention and the development of waste management after the Fifth Review Meeting, during the reporting period 2014 – 2016, are assessed in this report. There are currently two nuclear power plants operating in Finland: Loviisa and Olkiluoto plants. The Loviisa plant comprises two VVER- 440 units (Russian type pressurised water reactors), operated by Fortum Power and Heat Oy (FPH). The Olkiluoto plant comprises two BWR units (boiling water reactors); operated by Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO) and a third PWR (pressurized water reactor) unit is under construction. In addition, Fennovoima Oy (Fennovoima) has applied for a construction licence for one pressurised water reactor (AES- 2006) at Pyhäjoki. Spent fuel from the nuclear power plant units is stored in interim pool type storages at the power plant sites for tens of years until disposal. The interim spent fuel storages have already been in operation for about 30 years. The safety of the interim storages was enhanced during the reporting period. The spent nuclear fuel disposal project has progressed as planned. The construction licence for the encapsulation and disposal facility was granted by the Government to Posiva in November 2015 and the construction of the geological disposal facility started in Olkiluoto in December 2016. Fennovoima started the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of its own spent nuclear fuel disposal in summer 2016. Geological disposal facilities for low and intermediate level waste have been in operation since the 1990 s in Olkiluoto and Loviisa. In the future, the Olkiluoto facility is planned to be extended for operational waste from the OL 3 unit and decommissioning waste from all reactor units in Olkiluoto. The disposal facility in Loviisa will be extended for decommissioning waste from the Loviisa NPP units. Fennovoima has planned to build a geological disposal facility for its low and intermediate level waste at the Pyhäjoki site. Major developments in Finland since the 5 th Review Meeting are as follows: there has been real progress in spent nuclear fuel disposal, as well as the enhancement of spent fuel interim storage safety, in addition improvements have been made in NPP’s LILW management and non-nuclear radioactive waste disposal, and there has been significant progress in the planning of the research reactor decommissioning. Furthermore, the legislative and regulatory framework has been enhanced, national competences for future needs have been evaluated and developed, and the IRRS follow-up mission (IAEA’s Integrated Regulatory Review Service) was carried out in Finland. Only the main achievements are presented in this summary section. More detailed information on the latest developments in the various topics of the Convention is provided in connection with the relevant articles. Section K summarises the main achievements from the reporting period and also presents Finland’s future challenges in nuclear and radioactive waste management. Since the 5 th Review Meeting The 5 th Review Meeting in 2015 identified challenges, and recorded some planned measures to improve the safety of nuclear waste management in Finland. On request of the Review Meeting these issues and the responsed are included in this 6 th National Report of Finland. The issues are listed here, with the related references provided in brackets. A summary of how Finland has proceeded with the identified challenges during the reporting period is given in Section K. Finland – Challenges • Construction and oversight of the spent fuel (SF) disposal facility (Section H, Annexes L. 2 and L. 3) • Decommissioning and waste management of the FiR 1 research reactor (Article 9, Article 26, Annex L. 5) • Ensuring adequate resources and competence in tough economic situations (utilities, waste management organizations, and Government) (Article 20, Article 22) • Communication with public and stakeholders to maintain confidence in safe waste management and regulatory framework (Article 20) • Disposal of a few High-Activity Sealed Sources (HASS), which are not suitable for disposal in existing LILW repositories (Section J). Finland – Planned Measures to Improve Safety • Licensing of the encapsulation plant and the disposal facility for encapsulated spent fuel (Section H, Annexes L. 2 and L. 3) • Implementation of recommendations from the IRRS review (Article 20) • Licensing of research reactor decommissioning and start of dismantling activities (Article 9, Article 26, Annex L. 5). The legislative and regulatory system has been enhanced The current Finnish nuclear legislation is based on the Nuclear Energy Act from 1987, together with a supporting Nuclear Energy Decree from 1988. The Nuclear Energy Act has been revised several times over the years. The revision of the Nuclear Energy Act in 2015 enabled STUK to issue legally binding regulations. Based on the Nuclear Energy Act, STUK issued four regulations in 2016 to replace the earlier Government Decrees on nuclear safety for nuclear power plants, the security in the use of nuclear energy, the emergency response arrangements at nuclear power plants, and the disposal of nuclear waste. In addition, one new regulation for the safety of uranium and thorium production was issued. Development of national competences for future needs STUK’s role and responsibilities were assessed in a peer review, as part of the IRRS mission (IAEA’s Integrated Regulatory Review Service), in October 2012. In the followup mission in June 2015 the regulatory activities in Finland were reviewed based on the IAEA Safety Standards and international best practices. The main conclusion of the IRRS follow up mission was that STUK had made significant progress in most areas and many improvements had been implemented in accordance with the action plan. The implementation of the recommendations from the “Nuclear Energy Research Strategy”-report from 2013 is on-going by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment (MEAE). The main aim is to ensure the availability of the competent resources for the safe use of nuclear energy. As an example of the on-going implementation of the recommendations, the Nuclear Energy Act was updated in 2015 to ensure the financing of the enhancement of the nuclear safety research infrastructure. In addition to the basic training given for the nuclear sciences in universities in Espoo, Helsinki, and Lappeenranta, the availability of competent human resources has also been improved by the additional training of young experts in the nuclear safety field in different ways, e. g. through a networked doctoral programme (YTERA – Doctoral programme for Nuclear Engineering and Radiochemistry in 2012 – 2015) and through separately arranged national courses focusing on nuclear and waste management safety (YK and YJH Courses). Due to the rearrangement of research funding instruments in Finland and additional budget cuts by the Government, STUK has partly terminated and also significantly reduced its radiation safety research. Instead of its own research programme, STUK has established a national radiation safety research programme in co-operation with all universities in Finland to ensure that radiation safety research will continue in Finland. The spent nuclear fuel disposal project has progressed to the construction phase The Finnish nuclear fuel cycle policy is based on the once-through principle. After removal from the reactor spent fuel is stored in interim pool type storages at the power plant sites. After a storage period lasting tens of years, the spent fuel will be disposed of deep in the Finnish bedrock. Posiva submitted construction licence application and supporting safety documentation to the authorities at the end of 2012. STUK’s safety review and assessment was submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment (MEAE) in February 2015. The construction licence was granted by the Government to Posiva in November 2015. The construction of the disposal facility started in December 2016. Posiva is responsible for the preparations for and later on for the implementation of the disposal of spent fuel of its owners TVO and FPH. The disposal project and the granted licence cover spent fuel from five reactors: Loviisa 1 and 2, in addition to Olkiluoto 1, 2 and 3. In the Decision-in-Principle for Fennovoima’s new reactor unit, Fennovoima was required to define its plans for future spent nuclear fuel management and disposal by the end of June 2016. As required, in June 2016 Fennovoima submitted an Environmental Impact Assessment programme for its planned spent fuel disposal activities to the MEAE. Fennovoima and Posiva Solutions Oy (Posiva’s subsidiary that focuses on supplying services) have signed a co-operation agreement to ensure that the expertise of Posiva is available for Fennovoima’s spent nuclear fuel management activities. The co-operation started in 2016. Spent fuel interim storage safety has been enhanced The safety of the spent fuel storages was analysed {{as a part of the}} EU stress tests in relation to the Fukushima Dai-ichi accident. Hazards or deficiencies that would have required immediate action were not found, but areas where safety could be further enhanced were identified (e. g. reducing the dependency on nuclear power plant’s normal electricity supply and distribution systems as well as on the sea water cooled systems for residual heat removal of the reactor, containment and spent fuel storage pools, protection against external flooding, seismic resistance of spent fuel pools, and firefighting systems). The spent fuel interim storage facility in Olkiluoto undergone numerous improvements during its capacity extension, which became operational in summer 2015. These included, e. g. protection against large airplane crashes and enabling a cooling water feed from outside the storage area. Based on the evaluation in relation to the Fukushima Daiichi accident, water level and temperature monitoring functions have been improved for earthquake resistance and for the potential loss of the facility power supply. Additionally, the Loviisa spent fuel storage has been improved after the Fukushima Daiichi accident. The main changes are aimed at reducing the dependency on the plant’s normal electricity supply and distribution system, as well as on seawater cooled systems for residual heat removal from the reactor, containment and spent fuel pools. Furthermore, the flood protection of the NPP has been improved. Operation in low and intermediate level waste management proceeded The predisposal management of LILW was developed in Loviisa NPP during the reporting period as the solidification plant was authorized for full operation in 2016. Loviisa NPP has now been able to start the solidification of historical liquid wastes, which had been stored in tanks from the start of NPP’s operation in the late 1970 s. The aim is to solidify and dispose of all existing liquid waste in the forthcoming years. The disposal of non-nuclear radioactive waste has commenced Non-nuclear radioactive wastes originating, e. g. from research, industry and hospitals has been stored in a cavern in the LILW disposal facility at Olkiluoto. The licence conditions of the Olkiluoto LILW disposal facility were revised in 2012. The revised license enabled the disposal of non-nuclear radioactive waste in the Olkiluoto LILW disposal facility. The disposal of non-nuclear radioactive waste started in 2016 and currently most waste accumulated over the years have been disposed of. Planning for decommissioning Finland’s first nuclear reactor has started The research reactor FiR 1 (TRIGA Mark II, 250 kW) has been in operation since 1962. The operation of FiR 1 has been carried out by VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd. in Espoo since 1971. In 2012, VTT decided to shut down the research reactor due to insufficient funding for its continued operation. The Environmental Impact Assessment procedure for the decommissioning was conducted in 2013 - 2015. FiR 1 will be the first nuclear reactor to be decommissioned in Finland. VTT submitted an application to the Government for a decommissioning licence on June 20, 2017 (formally this is a new operating licence as the present Finnish legislation does not define a decommissioning licence). The dismantling is scheduled to start in early 2019 and to last about two years. The dismantling will be regulated by STUK concerning the radiation and nuclear safety aspects. Challenges for future work in spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste management Finland has identified for itself challenges for the future work in spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste management and these are summarized below. Progress in spent nuclear fuel disposal programme has been identified as a continuous challenge because the proceeding project requires the development of regulatory requirements. Moreover, regulatory oversight needs to be developed and adjusted for the different project phases. STUK has procedures in place to review and update plans and regulations as the disposal project proceeds to each new phase and the needs for development are identified. Furthermore, Posiva is well prepared for the construction phase of the disposal project and preparations are ongoing for the forthcoming operation phase. In addition, the development of national competences and a regulatory framework are identified as a continuous challenge because the nuclear field in Finland is very active at the moment and compentent resources are required both for regulatory oversight as well as for licensees and license applicants. Finland has identified following three main challenges for the future work: • Improvement of the national plan for radioactive waste management Finland has a well-functioning system and technical solutions for the management of nuclear waste arising from NPPs and also for major part of non-nuclear radioactive wastes. However, as a consequence of 1) an incident at a <b>sealed</b> <b>radioactive</b> <b>source</b> in the storage facilities in Suomen Nukliditekniikka and its related clean-up work (for more detail information see Section J, article 28), 2) planning of the research reactor decommissioning waste storage and disposal and 3) unresolved challenges of disposal for a few HASS sources, it has been identified that the national radioactive waste management plan and licensing system needs to be evaluated and improved to ensure a national system with capabilities for all possible waste streams. MEAE has invited an ad-hoc expert group to address these issues. The group will also address recommendations made by the Finnish Safety Investigation Authority about the sealed source incident. This group will start its work in autumn 2017. • Developing competences and a regulatory framework for decommissioning The research reactor, FiR 1, will be the first nuclear reactor to be decommissioned in Finland. As this is the first decommissioning project, Finland has limited experience in this area. VTT and STUK are both co-operating internationally gathering knowledge and experience about the implementation and regulation of decommissioning. The decommissioning project of the research reactor is also a very important learning process for STUK as the experiences gained will be used in updating regulations and YVL guides and also later on in planning the regulatory oversight for the decommissioning of NPPs. • Communication to improve general public’s understanding of disposal safety The Finnish public has a high degree of trust in the radiation and nuclear safety regulator, STUK, and there is a good degree of trust towards the safety of nuclear waste management and disposal. However, the interest of the general public towards disposal seems to be declining. Additionally, the latest poll results (conducted by e. g. Finnish Energy in 2016) show indications of a slight decrease in trust towards thesafety of nuclear waste disposal. Developments of these trends need to be followed in forthcoming polls. The regulatory work and decisions made by the regulator have to be clear and understandable to the general public. The general public should also have the correct understanding of disposal safety and related risks. Due to these challenges, STUK, for its part, initiated a strategic communication development project in spring 2016 to address both the changing communication environment and the use of modern communication tools. Candidate for good practice Finland has identified that the granting of the construction licence for a spent fuel disposal facility is a candidate for good practice. Finland is the first country that has granted a construction licence for a final repository for spent fuel. Construction of the facility is ongoing. The development and evaluation of safe disposal has been a long-lasting systematic process involving conducted in good co-operation with the Government, ministries, regulators, Posiva, nuclear power companies as well as research organisations while acknowledging the roles and responsibilities of the different parties. The approach taken in Finland has enabled timely progress of the disposal project with political and public support and resulted in approval of the construction licencelicence application in 2015. This is a concrete step towards improving safety in a unique and proven manner. Conclusion In conclusion, based on the information presented in the report, Finland complies with the obligations and objectives of the Joint Convention. Challenges for the future have been recognized, regularly reviewed and addressed. The required efforts for continuous improvement have been made...|$|E

50|$|The {{three main}} {{divisions}} of radiation therapy are external beam radiation therapy or teletherapy, brachytherapy or sealed source radiation therapy, and systemic radioisotope therapy or unsealed source radiotherapy. The differences {{relate to the}} position of the radiation source; external is outside the body, brachytherapy uses <b>sealed</b> <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> placed precisely in the area under treatment, and systemic radioisotopes are given by infusion or oral ingestion. Brachytherapy can use temporary or permanent placement of <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources.</b> The temporary sources are usually placed by a technique called afterloading. In afterloading a hollow tube or applicator is placed surgically in the organ to be treated, and the sources are loaded into the applicator after the applicator is implanted. This minimizes radiation exposure to health care personnel. Particle therapy is a special case of external beam radiation therapy where the particles are protons or heavier ions. Intraoperative radiation therapy or IORT is a special type of radiation therapy that is delivered immediately after surgical removal of the cancer. This method has been employed in breast cancer (TARGeted Introperative radiation therapy or TARGIT), brain tumors and rectal cancers.|$|R

Legislation specifies that the holder of authorisation have the obligation and responsibility to take all necessary measures in order to ensure and maintain a strict record of the nuclear and radioactive materials as well as of all sources used or produced. A database of SSRS is kept by RWTP but it is incomplete, usually the missing data being the activity of sources. The loss of regulatory control on the SSRS is avoided since the license of manufacture, import, utilisation, transfer and transport of these sources are done according to a strict procedure of authorisation...|$|R
25|$|Historically, {{the three}} main {{divisions}} of radiation therapy are external beam radiation therapy (EBRT or XRT) or teletherapy, brachytherapy or sealed source radiation therapy, and systemic radioisotope therapy or unsealed source radiotherapy. The differences relate {{to the position of}} the radiation source; external is outside the body, brachytherapy uses <b>sealed</b> <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> placed precisely in the area under treatment, and systemic radioisotopes are given by infusion or oral ingestion. Brachytherapy can use temporary or permanent placement of <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources.</b> The temporary sources are usually placed by a technique called afterloading. In afterloading a hollow tube or applicator is placed surgically in the organ to be treated, and the sources are loaded into the applicator after the applicator is implanted. This minimizes radiation exposure to health care personnel. Particle therapy is a special case of external beam radiation therapy where the particles are protons or heavier ions. Intraoperative radiation therapy or IORT is a special type of radiation therapy that is delivered immediately after surgical removal of the cancer. This method has been employed in breast cancer (TARGeted Introperative radiation therapy or TARGIT), brain tumors and rectal cancers.|$|R
40|$|<b>Sealed</b> <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> {{are used}} in medicine, {{industry}} and research {{for a wide range}} of purposes. They can contain different radionuclides in greatly varying amounts. At the end of their useful lives, they are termed 'disused sources' but their activity levels can still be quite high. They are, for all practical purposes, another type of radioactive waste that needs to be disposed of safely. Disused <b>sealed</b> <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> can represent a significant hazard to people if not managed properly. Many countries have no special facilities for the management or disposal of radioactive waste, as they have no nuclear power programmes requiring such facilities. Even in countries with developed nuclear programmes, disused sealed sources present problems as they often fall outside the common categories of radioactive waste for which disposal options have been identified. As a result, many disused sealed sources are kept in storage. Depending on the nature of the storage arrangements, this situation may represent a high potential risk to workers and to the public. The IAEA has received numerous requests for assistance from Member States faced with the problem of safely managing disused sealed sources. The requests have related to both technical and safety aspects. Particularly urgent requests have involved emergency situations arising from unsafe storage conditions and lost sources. There is therefore an important requirement for the development of safe and cost-effective final disposal solutions. Consequently, a number of activities have been initiated by the IAEA to assist Member States in the management of disused sealed sources. The objective of this report is to address safety issues relevant to the disposal of disused sealed sources, and other limited amounts of radioactive waste, in borehole facilities. It is the first in a series of reports aiming to provide an indication of the present issues related to the use of borehole disposal facilities to safely disp <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> and other smaller quantities of radioactive waste and to identify areas were further work needs to be undertaken. This report discusses the general considerations related to the safe disposal of disused sealed sources, and other limited quantities of radioactive waste, in boreholes facilities. It is particularly aimed at Member States who do not plan to develop other types of disposal facility for nuclear fuel cycle waste. It is recognized that internationally agreed safety guidance is needed in this area but further development and consultation is required to establish broad international consensus on the appropriate technology and safety requirement...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the application of}} multiple characterization methods to radioactive wastes generated by the Sandia National Laboratories/New Mexico (SNL/NM) Environmental Restoration (ER) Project during the excavation of buried materials at the Classified Waste Landfill (CWLF) and the Radioactive Waste Landfill (RWL). These waste streams include nuclear weapon components and other refuse that are surface contaminated or contain <b>sealed</b> <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> with unknown radioactivity content. Characterization of radioactive constituents in RWL and CWLF waste has been problematic, due primarily {{to the lack of}} documented characterization data prior to burial. A second difficulty derives from the limited information that ER project personnel have about weapons component design and testing that was conducted {{in the early days of}} the Cold War. To reduce the uncertainties and achieve the best possible waste characterization, the ER Project has applied both project-specific and industry-standard characterization methods that, in combination, serve to define the types and quantities of radionuclide constituents in the waste. The resulting characterization data have been used to develop waste profiles for meeting disposal site waste acceptance criteria...|$|R
50|$|<b>Sealed</b> <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> are {{routinely}} used in formation evaluation of both hydraulically fractured and non-fracked wells. The sources are {{lowered into the}} borehole {{as part of the}} well logging tools, and are removed from the borehole before any hydraulic fracturing takes place. Measurement of formation density is made using a sealed caesium-137 source. This bombards the formation with high energy gamma rays. The attenuation of these gamma rays gives an accurate measure of formation density; this has been a standard oilfield tool since 1965. Another source is americium berylium (Am-Be) neutron source used in evaluation of the porosity of the formation, and this has been used since 1950. In a drilling context, these sources are used by trained personnel, and radiation exposure of those personnel is monitored. Usage is covered by licenses from International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) guidelines, SU or European Union protocols, and the Environment Agency in the UK. Licenses are required for access, transport, and use of <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources.</b> These sources are very large, and the potential for their use in a 'dirty bomb' means security issues are considered as important. There is no risk to the public, or to water supplies under normal usage. They are transported to a well site in shielded containers, which means exposure to the public is very low, much lower than the background radiation dose in one day.|$|R

Due to their age, a lack of available manufacturer data and unknown origin, or the potential for leakage, some of the <b>radioactive</b> <b>sealed</b> <b>sources</b> targeted for recovery by the OSR Project do not meet US Department of Transportation (US DOT) Type A requirements. Sealed sources that are special form can be shipped using US DOT Type A, 7 A packages, which provide increased flexibility in shipping. In 2000, the OSR Project developed a sealed source overpack called the LANL Special Form Capsule (SFC) Model I to provide a method to ensure US DOT special form containment of <b>radioactive</b> <b>sealed</b> <b>sources</b> during transport. A key feature of the SFC was {{that it could be}} easily assembled in the field and allowed sealed sources which did not have current special form certification or documentation for domestic transport to be made special form by field encapsulation in a LANL SFC. After successful testing of the Model I and Model II, it was decided to fabricate a third capsule to accommodate the many source sizes. The Model III, with an internal diameter of 1. 5 inches was then fabricated and tested. This third model of the LAN...|$|R
40|$|Beginning in the 1950 's {{the federal}} government, through the Atomic Energy Commission, began {{providing}} limited quantities of {{special nuclear material}} to industry and research institutions to stimulate advances in nuclear science and technology. By the early 1960 s the identified beneficial uses of radioactive material had added Am- 241, Cs- 137, CO- 60, and Sr- 90 {{to the list of}} common isotopes which were distributed in significant numbers as high-energy sealed sources for industry, medicine and research. By the mid 1980 s many of these <b>sealed</b> <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources</b> were thirty years old and the changing priorities of research and industry had rendered many of them excess. Unfortunately, many of these sources exceeded activity limits established for Low-Level Waste (LLW) disposal and the owners were left with no viable options to rid themselves of unwanted material. In 1985, Congress attempted to address this concern by assigning responsibility for disposal of radioactive material which exceeded the Class-C LLW limits to the US Department of Energy (DOE) in the Low-Level Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985 (PL 99 - 240). As with other attempts for disposal facility development however, the years passed and the facilities were not forthcoming. This paper briefly describes the history of government efforts to effect retrieval of these sources and provides projections on availability of retrieval services by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). A summary of eligible materials, points of contact at LANL, and recommended actions by current source owners are included...|$|R
40|$|The nuclear {{aspect of}} the CBRN* threat is often divided amongst {{radiological}} substances posing no criticality risk, {{often referred to as}} 'dirty bomb' scenarios, and fissile threats. The latter have the theoretical potential for criticality excursion, resulting in elevated neutron fluxes in addition to the γ-ray component that is common to dirty bombs. Even in isolation of the highly-unlikely criticality scenario, fissile substances often exhibit radiation fields comprising a significant neutron component which can require considerably different counterterrorism measures and clean-up methodologies. The contrast between these threats can indicate important differences in the relative sophistication of the perpetrators and their organizations. Consequently, the detection and discrimination of nuclear perils in terms of mixed-field content is an important assay in combating terrorist threats. In this paper we report on the design and implementation of a fast digitizer and embedded-processor for onthe- fly signal processing of events from organic liquid scintillators. A digital technique, known as Pulse Gradient Analysis (PGA), has been developed at Lancaster University for the digital discrimination of neutrons and γ rays. PGA has been deployed on bespoke hardware and demonstrates remarkable improvement over analogue methods for the assay of mixed fields and the real-time discrimination of neutrons and γ rays. In this regard the technology constitutes an attractive and affordable means for the discrimination of the radiation fields arising from fissile threats and those from dirty bombs. Data are presented demonstrating this capability with <b>sealed</b> <b>radioactive</b> <b>sources...</b>|$|R
