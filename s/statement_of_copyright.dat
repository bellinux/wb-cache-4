We decided to eschew this route, {{on the grounds that the}} perceived quality of our publications would be reduced. We feel it is important to follow the standards of consensus in the field. If these standards change in the future, we will changewith them.|$|E

40|$|This multi-method study {{reports the}} results of two {{complementary}} experiments investigating the relevance of cash flow and accrual information. A behavioural field experiment investigated differences in the accuracy of solvency assessments between commercial lending managers using cash flow information and those using accrual information. Results indicated that commercial lending managers using cash flow information made more accurate solvency assessments than managers using accrual information. Results of an archival quantitative modeling experiment complemented these results and indicated cash flow information had incremental information content beyond accrual information. Our results confirmed the decision-usefulness of cash flow information and supported the mandate <b>of</b> the <b>Statement</b> <b>of</b> Cash Flows. <b>Copyright</b> Blackwell Publishers Ltd, 2003. ...|$|R

25|$|One of {{the main}} aspects of the series is the live feeds, in which viewers can view inside the house at any time. The live feeds {{have been a part}} of the series since its inception, {{initially}} being offered as a free service during the first season. From the second season onward, a subscription to the live feeds has been required, with the price ranging each year. The first season's feeds were available on the show's official site, hosted by AOL. From the second season to the fourteenth season, the feeds were available through RealNetworks either as a subscription or as a free addition for Gold members. With the fifteenth season onward, the live feeds have aired on the official CBS website, again requiring a subscription from users. Though advertised as being available at any time, the feeds are shut off during the weekly nomination ceremony, Power of Veto ceremony, and the competitions and evictions for that week; this is to provide suspense for the series. Slanderous <b>statements</b> and singing <b>of</b> <b>copyrighted</b> music are also blocked for legal reasons.|$|R
5000|$|The Buenos Aires Convention is a {{copyright}} treaty signed at Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 11 August 1910, providing mutual recognition <b>of</b> <b>copyrights</b> where the work carries a notice containing a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> {{reservation of rights}} (Art. 3). This was commonly done with the phrase [...] "All rights reserved" [...] (Spanish [...] "Todos los derechos reservados", Portuguese [...] "Todos os direitos reservados") next to the copyright notice. This implementation varied as US law only required the author and year <b>of</b> publishing. <b>Copyright</b> protection under the Convention is granted for the shorter {{of the terms of}} the protecting country and the source country of the work ("rule of the shorter term", Arts. 6, 7). The rather vague nature of the requirement for a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> reservation {{led to the development of}} longer and more legalistic wordings, which have persisted despite the developments in international copyright law.|$|R

5000|$|Copyright controversies {{in online}} and digital texts {{affect the way}} digital rhetoric is utilized. Many of these {{arguments}} {{deal with the problem}} of cost for the publishers and consumers <b>of</b> scholarly text. <b>Copyrighting</b> materials is an expensive task, especially when the materials can be translated into many other forms of digital sources that are freely found by the public. Because of this ease <b>of</b> transformation, <b>copyright</b> laws are undermined as scholars lose predication in their online materials through maneuvers as simple as copy and paste or translating hyperlinks. In James P. Zappen's piece [...] "Digital Rhetoric: Toward an Integrated Theory", he refers to transferring material in ways that create misapplication of a work that a scholar has written. [...] "A media database, for example, can produce an almost infinite variety of end-user objects, which can be customized for different users, manipulated through hyperlinks, periodically updated, and scaled upon demand." [...] Zappen's <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> [...] "infinite" [...] is in no way subjective or an over statement. Many digital pieces are infringed upon, stolen, or misused by the avoidance <b>of</b> <b>copyright.</b> These many forms <b>of</b> <b>copyright</b> avoidance lend to the controversy of digital rhetoric and media as a whole.|$|R
40|$|This {{meta-analysis}} explores {{agreement in}} self and supervisory ratings of job performance (k = 128 independent samples). It suggests a three-stage {{model of the}} rating process and reviews the empirical evidence for the relevance {{of each of these}} three stages to an understanding of agreement in ratings. The proposed three-stage model serves as the guiding rationale for the examination of an extensive set of variables that moderate rater agreement. Results are reported for two indicators of rater agreement (correlational and mean level agreement). Self-supervisor ratings yielded an overall correlation of r =. 22 (rho =. 34; k = 115; n = 37752). Position characteristics and the use of non-judgmental performance indicators were the main moderators. Leniency in self-ratings is indicated by higher mean levels of self-ratings compared to supervisory ratings. Within Western samples, performance self-ratings showed leniency (d =. 32, delta =. 49; k = 89; n = 35417) dependent on contextual features, scale format, and scale content. <b>Copyright</b> <b>statement</b> The <b>copyright</b> <b>of</b> this document has been transferred on behalf of the authors to the American Psychological Association (APA), Journal of Applied Psycholog...|$|R
