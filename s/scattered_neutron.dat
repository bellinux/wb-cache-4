50|$|Quasielastic neutron {{scattering}} (QENS) designates a limiting case of inelastic {{neutron scattering}}, characterized by energy transfers being {{small compared to}} the incident energy of the scattered particles. In a more strict meaning, it denotes scattering processes where dynamics in the sample (such as diffusive dynamics) lead to a broadening of the incident neutron spectrum, in contrast to, e.g., the scattering from a diffusionless crystal, where the <b>scattered</b> <b>neutron</b> energy spectrum consists of an elastic line (corresponding to no energy transfer with the sample) {{and a number of}} well-separated inelastic lines due to the creation or annihilation of phonons with specific energies.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{and due to}} the {{specificity}} of the muon, the µSR technique does not require any radio-frequency technique to align the probing spin. On the other hand, {{a clear distinction between}} the µSR technique and those involving neutrons or X-rays is that scattering is not involved. Neutron diffraction techniques, for example, use the change in energy and/or momentum of a <b>scattered</b> <b>neutron</b> to deduce the sample properties. In contrast, the implanted muons are not diffracted but remain in a sample until they decay. Only a careful analysis of the decay product (i.e. a positron) provides information about the interaction between the implanted muon and its environment in the sample.|$|E

Results are generally communicated as the dynamic structure factor (also called inelastic scattering law) , sometimes also as the dynamic susceptibility [...] where the scattering vector [...] {{is the difference between}} incoming and outgoing wave vector, and '''' is the energy change experienced by the sample (negative that of the <b>scattered</b> <b>neutron).</b> When results are plotted as function of , they can often be interpreted {{in the same way as}} spectra obtained by conventional spectroscopic techniques; insofar as inelastic neutron scattering can be seen as a special spectroscopy.|$|E

40|$|We {{will use}} the {{expressions}} relating energy and scattering angles derived in the previous chapter to determine the energy and angular distributions of an elastically <b>scattered</b> <b>neutron.</b> The energy distribution, in particular, is widely used {{in the analysis of}} neutron energy moderation in systems where neutrons are produced at high energies (Mev) by nuclear reactions and slow down to thermal energies. This is the problem of neutron slowing down, where the assumption of the target nucleus being initially at rest is justified. When the neutron energy approaches the thermal region (~ 0. 025 ev), the stationary target assumption is no longer valid. One can relax this assumption and derive a more general distribution which holds for neutron elastic scattering at any energy. This then is the result that should be used for the analysis of the spectrum (energy distribution) of thermal neutrons, a problem known as neutron thermalization. As part of this discussion we will have an opportunity to study the energy dependence of the elastic scattering cross section. We have seen from our study of cross section calculation using the method of phase shift that for low-energy scattering (kro << 1, which is equivalent to neutron energies below about 10 - 100 kev) only s-wave contribution to the cross section is important, and moreover, the angular distribution of the <b>scattered</b> <b>neutron</b> is spherically symmetric in CMCS.

40|$|Incoherent {{background}} {{can create}} an intrinsic problem for standard small angle neutron scattering measurements. Biological samples contain hydrogen {{which is a}} strong incoherent scatterer thus creating an intrinsic source of background that makes determination of the coherent scattering parameters difficult in special situations. This can especially be true for the Q-range from around 0. 1 - 0. 5 Å^- 1 where improper knowledge of the background level can lead to ambiguity in determination of the samples structure parameters. Polarization analysis {{is a way of}} removing this ambiguity by allowing one to distinguish the coherent from incoherent scattering, even when the coherent scattering is {{only a small fraction of}} the total scattered intensity. ^ 3 He spin filters are ideal for accomplishing this task because they permit the analysis of large area and large divergence <b>scattered</b> <b>neutron</b> beams without adding to detector background or changing the prorogation of the <b>scattered</b> <b>neutron</b> beam.
