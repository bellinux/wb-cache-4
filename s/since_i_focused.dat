40|$|This month’s {{column is}} about {{maintaining}} a separation between {{some kinds of}} forensic work and providing gen-eral patient care for the same patient/evaluee. It {{has been a long}} time <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>focused</b> on this topic in this col-umn, 1 but the issue remains very relevant. In a perfect world, the multifaceted conflict of interest between objective forensic work and the obligations of a doctor-patient relationship would never occur. In the real world, however, such conflicts happen all the time, and while they are sometimes harmless, they can also create big problems. Note that I am not implying that “forensic ” practice doesn’t include clinical work. There are many clinical aspects of forensic work, just as patient care has a num-ber of points of interface with the legal system. The poin...|$|E
40|$|Data mining {{occurs because}} most {{economic}} hypotheses {{do not have}} a unique empirical interpretation but allow the econometrician much leeway in selecting conditioning variables, lags, functional forms, and sometimes the sample. The resulting problems are of interest not only to methodologists and philosophers concerned with how hypotheses are validated in the presence of some inevitable ad hocery but, also to readers of economics journals who have no interest in methodology but need to know whether to believe what they read. <b>Since</b> <b>I</b> <b>focus</b> on such mundane problems I make no claim of contributing to the deeper epistemological problems of relating empirical evidence to theory, and to the meaning of confirmation and disconfirmation when, say five of the eight specifications tested are consistent with the hypothesis and, three are not. Instead, I deal with a practical problem confronting a researcher who wants to persuade his readers but does not want to deceive them. He has fitted many regressions with varying results. How should he decide how many and which ones to report? This paper is therefore more about a problem in communicating results than about a problem in the philosophy of science. Hence, I use some common-sense notions, even though I cannot provide rigorous definitions for them. Data Mining, Extreme Bounds Analysis,...|$|R

40|$|The {{present report}} aims at giving {{a survey of}} my work {{since the end of}} my PhD thesis "Spectral Methods for Reconstruction Problems". <b>Since</b> then <b>I</b> <b>focussed</b> on the {{analysis}} of properties of different models of random graphs as well as their connection to real-world networks. This report's goal is to capture these problems in a common framework. The very last chapter of this thesis about results in bootstrap percolation is different {{in the sense that the}} given graph is deterministic and only the decision of being active for each vertex is probabilistic; since the proof techniques resemble very much results on random graphs, we decided to include them as well. We start with an overview of the five random graph models, and with the description of bootstrap percolation corresponding to the last chapter. Some properties of these models are then analyzed in the different parts of this thesis...|$|R

30|$|From {{this point}} of view, our results are {{reasonably}} in line with those obtained by Guiso et al.: we similarly find that immigration attitudes are significantly more negative for Catholics and Protestants; however, we find no significant effect for Muslims. This {{could be due to}} the lower number of Muslims in the USA, as compared to the cross-country WVS sample. Moreover, differently from Guiso et al., we find that church attendance has a mitigating effect on negative immigration attitudes. Of course, one should handle this comparison with some further caution, <b>since</b> (<b>i)</b> our sample <b>focuses</b> on the USA; (ii) we are concerned with illegal immigration, rather than with the immigration phenomenon as a whole; and (iii) we use as the dependent variable a policy-related question, instead of a direct question about attitudes.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two essays examining the roles of corporate governance and investor disagreement, respectively, in the performance and stock market valuations of firms. In the first chapter, I demonstrate {{that the relationship between}} corporate governance and firm performance varies with industry performance cycles. Firms with strong shareholder rights capture higher profits than poorly-governed firms in the same industry during highly profitable periods for the industry, but both groups have similar profits during weaker industry conditions. Analyst forecasts indicate that the pattern is expected, suggesting that the higher valuations of well-governed firms are due to this higher expected productivity in good times. Consistent with such expectations and with an updating of valuations as anticipated industry conditions change, positive abnormal stock returns to good governance are concentrated in periods of high industry returns, and are at least partially reversed during industry downturns. My results provide an alternative to learning and static risk theories in explaining the apparent abnormal returns to governance and their disappearance after 2001. In Chapter 2, I consider the impact of heterogeneous shareholder beliefs on stock prices, focusing on the context of corporate spin-offs and mergers. I extend theoretical work by Miller (1977) and Jarrow (1980) to show that when investors disagree about the prospects of different businesses and {{at least some of them}} are restricted from short-selling, the market price of an unseparable bundle of two enterprises will often be lower from the sum of the prices at which they would trade as standalone entities. Empirically, I construct a novel measure of observed disagreement that is informed by the theory and is less open to alternative interpretations than existing disagreement proxies. Consistent with the theory, I find that higher disagreement about the two components being either separated or joined is related to a positive return in the case of spin-offs and a negative return in stock mergers. Importantly, <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>focus</b> on returns on the ex date of these transactions, on which no new business information is released, these findings are unrelated to the expected business impact of the transactions. by Tara Kumari Bhandari.

40|$|How {{flexible}} can encryption be? This question {{motivated the}} invention of public key encryption that began modern cryptography. A lot has happened <b>since</b> then. <b>I</b> will <b>focus</b> on two lines of research that I find especially interesting (mainly the second) and the mysterious gap between them. The first line of research asks: how flexibly can encryption handle compu-tation? The answer seems to be “very flexibly”. We have fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) schemes [RAD 78,Gen 09,DGHV 10,BV 11 b,GH 11,BV 11 a] that allow a worker (non-interactively) to do arbitrary blind processing of encrypted data without obtaining access to the data. However, current FHE schemes do not handle access control flexibly; {{there is only one}} keyholder, and only it can decrypt. The second line of research asks: how flexibly can encryption handle access control? Again, the answer seems to be “very flexibly”. Building on Garg et al. ’s [GGH 12 b] approximate multilinear maps, we now have attribute-based en-cryption (ABE) schemes for arbitrary circuits [SW 12,GGH 12 a] that allow a...|$|R

40|$|The paper links finance {{theory to}} labor {{economics}} and political {{economy in the}} context of migration and immigration policy. Most research treating the impact of immigration has focused on the consequences for employees as measured by wages, earnings, and employment. Less is known about the impact on employers. We lack answers to basic questions concerning the quantitative impact of immigrants on employer profit, and which employers are most likely to gain (suffer) increased (reduced) profits as a result of immigration. Using event study analysis, I measure the impact of immigration policy on the profit of employers and shareholders, particularly in those industries with high needs for skilled immigrants. The American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act (ACWIA) of 1998 nearly doubled the available number of H- 1 B visas for skilled foreign workers in FY 1999. It {{was the first time that}} the U. S. government raised the annual cap of H- 1 B visa <b>since</b> 1990. <b>I</b> <b>focus</b> on this bill and analyze whether and by how much its passage increased shareholders' profit. The empirical results show that employers and shareholders in the top H- 1 B visa user industries enjoyed significant and positive returns with the passage of the ACWIA of 1998. Shareholders in high-tech industries (the top users of H- 1 B visa, 80 % of total) such as Computers and related equipment, and Computer and data processing services gained, respectively, an average 21. 54 % (15. 88 if weighted) and 22. 77 % (18. 11 if weighted) in cumulative excess returns in the month after the Act was passed, while industries with little need for H- 1 B visas experienced no significant changes in cumulative excess returns.

40|$|Summary The {{purpose of}} this study has been to {{investigate}} how Fredrikstad’s work with sustainable development is expressed today after having had sustainable development on their agenda since 1994. The background for this approach is the municipality’s responsibility to promote sustainable development based on the Law for Planning and Building. I have been curious how municipalities tackle this immense and complex challenge. The question I chose for this case study is: How is work with sustainable development expressed I Fredrikstad after having sustainable development on the municipality agenda <b>since</b> 1994 ? <b>I</b> <b>focused</b> particularly on the social dimension of sustainable development. Knowledge about Fredrikstad municipality’s work to promote a sustainable development is based on information gained through interviews and from available plans and reports. I have examined this information in light of a specific model for sustainable development and several theories I feel are relevant. The concept of sustainable development is perceived to be important {{but it is difficult to}} see clearly the connection between dimensions in the concept. The municipality is primarily concerned with the ecological dimension in their role as a community developer and with the social dimension in their role as a service provider. The plan and management system in place testify to the desire to gain a more holistic grip on development. However, it continues to be a challenge to achieve a better connection between the municipality plan (strategic level) and action plans and annual reports (operative level). Fredrikstad has chosen to define sustainable development through actions rather than words. What the municipality considers to be important can be expressed in a “new” model for sustainable development: Sustainability Arrow (Armann, K. A. Nakkerud, M. B. 2008). It is characterized by the following elements: To see the three dimensions of sustainable development in connection with each other (1 - 3), think longterm (4), facilitate participation (5), develop practice (6), develop knowledge (7), facilitate value debates (8), have a global perspective (Earth) ...|$|R

Specifically, <b>I</b> <b>focus</b> on movie distributors and their contracts with exhibitors to show their movies on their screens. I argue that vertical inte-gration solves the distortion on movie run length created by the revenue sharing contracts used in the industry. <b>Since</b> <b>I</b> observe the same movie showing {{in the same period}} under different organizational forms in the Spanish market, I use a difference on different approach to exploit this variation and study differences in outcomes across organizational forms. I show that integrated theaters run their own movies longer than other movies, and longer than nonintegrated thea-ters do. This effect is stronger for movies of more uncertain demand due to higher contractual complexity. I also find that integrated distributors specialize in the movies of higher demand uncertainty.
