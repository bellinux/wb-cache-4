We have also come to look upon natural disasters and mass epidemics as security threats, as they can often disrupt our lives and societies much more dramatically than even military threats. These new and holistic conceptions of security have led to new forms of security cooperation between nations. Earlier, countries used to secure themselves from traditional military threats by adopting forms of neutrality or by aligning themselves in mutual defence arrangements with other countries. In our age, we have evolved a new form of security cooperation, one that is based on regular, <b>structured</b> <b>dialogue</b> between different nations rather than on formal alliances." ...|$|E

Through a focus on the facilitation of dialogue and on the conversational aspects of problem structuring we show how Decision <b>Structuring</b> <b>Dialogue</b> facilitates collective framing and structuring of complex problems under conflicting interests. Decision <b>Structuring</b> <b>Dialogue</b> is suitable for structuring problems that involve multiple actors, multiple perspectives and conflicting interests. Decision <b>Structuring</b> <b>Dialogue</b> is a process helping to create a shared vision of the problem and the possible decision alternatives. It complements other problem structuring methods and acts as the first step in MCDA. The method was successfully applied in the steering group of a Finnish lake regulation project with a high conflict factor...|$|R

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the emigration from Czech territory to Brazil since the 20 th century to the present. The thesis {{is based on the}} analysis of push and pull factors which led to emigration in both the domestic and receiving countries. In the first chapter, there are presented theoretical factors which could possibly lead to emigration and in the second chapter these factors are directly applied on the historical background in both countries. In the last chapter, the presence of these factors is analyzed in particular human testimonies which were found out by the author of this thesis via <b>structured</b> <b>dialogues</b> with Czech emigrants. The aim of this thesis is to identify push and pull factors of emigration and to present them in those testimonies. The aim is thus not to generalize these motives on a large scale but likely to analyze through the push and pull factors the circumstances and particular stories of emigration at eight enquired respondents.

Focus structure is coded in terms of a number of focal parameters, which may differ from one type of dialogue to another. Relations between values of focal parameters on neighboring discourse segments are determined by a simple model. The coding scheme is flexible and has a high de-gree of inter rater reliability. It enables com-parisons between different types of dialogues and testing of assumed models for dialogue manage-ment.
