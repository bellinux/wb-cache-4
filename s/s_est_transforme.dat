40|$|Abstract Background White mold, {{caused by}} Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, {{is one of}} the most {{important}} diseases of pea (Pisum sativum L.), however, little is known about the genetics and biochemistry of this interaction. Identification of genes underlying resistance in the host or pathogenicity and virulence factors in the pathogen will increase our knowledge of the pea- S. sclerotiorum interaction and facilitate the introgression of new resistance genes into commercial pea varieties. Although the S. sclerotiorum genome sequence is available, no pea genome is available, due in part to its large genome size (~ 3500 Mb) and extensive repeated motifs. Here we present an EST data set specific to the interaction between S. sclerotiorum and pea, and a method to distinguish pathogen and host sequences without a species-specific reference genome. Results 10, 158 contigs were obtained by de novo assembly of 128, 720 high-quality reads generated by 454 pyrosequencing of the pea- S. sclerotiorum interactome. A method based on the tBLASTx program was modified to distinguish pea and <b>S.</b> sclerotiorum <b>ESTs.</b> To test this strategy, a mixture of known ESTs (18, 490 pea and 17, 198 [*] <b>S.</b> sclerotiorum <b>ESTs)</b> from public databases were pooled and parsed; the tBLASTx method successfully separated 90. 1 % of the artificial EST mix with 99. 9 % accuracy. The tBLASTx method successfully parsed 89. 4 % of the 454 -derived EST contigs, as validated by PCR, into pea (6, 299 contigs) and S. sclerotiorum (2, 780 contigs) categories. Two thousand eight hundred and forty pea ESTs and 996 [*] <b>S.</b> sclerotiorum <b>ESTs</b> were predicted to be expressed specifically during the pea- S. sclerotiorum interaction as determined by homology search against 81, 449 pea ESTs (from flowers, leaves, cotyledons, epi- and hypocotyl, and etiolated and light treated etiolated seedlings) and 57, 751 [*] <b>S.</b> sclerotiorum <b>ESTs</b> (from mycelia at neutral pH, developing apothecia and developing sclerotia). Among those ESTs specifically expressed, 277 (9. 8 %) pea ESTs were predicted to be involved in plant defense and response to biotic or abiotic stress, and 93 (9. 3 %) <b>S.</b> sclerotiorum <b>ESTs</b> were predicted to be involved in pathogenicity/virulence. Additionally, 142 [*] <b>S.</b> sclerotiorum <b>ESTs</b> were identified as secretory/signal peptides of which only 21 were previously reported. Conclusions We present and characterize an EST resource specific to the pea- S. sclerotiorum interaction. Additionally, the tBLASTx method used to parse S. sclerotiorum and pea ESTs was demonstrated to be a reliable and accurate method to distinguish ESTs without a reference genome. </p...|$|R

La pensée de G. Contarini et celle de D. Giannotti interviennent de manière fondamentale dans ce processus. Leur confrontation met en évidence la tension d’une pensée politique qui, à l’époque, se situe dans un entre-deux théorique : encore marquée par la conception des trois formes de gouvernement et de leurs formes corrompues, cherchant à s’en distancer en créant d’autres cadres conceptuels.

40|$|Le sulfure d’hydrogène (H 2 <b>S)</b> <b>est</b> produit dans de nombreux tissus, et notamment dans le cerveau, où il joue un rôle de neuromodulateur. H 2 S augmente ainsi les réponses mises en jeu par les récepteurs NMDA et {{facilite}} l’induction d’une potentialisation à long terme dans l’hippocampe. L’altération de la concentration de l’activateur physiologique de la cystathionine β synthase, enzyme responsable de la synthèse d’H 2 S dans le cerveau, explique la diminution de la concentration d’H 2 S dans les cerveaux de sujets atteints de maladie d’Alzheimer. L’hyperproduction d’H 2 S décrite chez les sujets trisomiques 21 est probablement liée à l’hyperexpression de cette même enzyme, dont le gène est localisé sur le chromosome 21. The {{formation of}} H 2 S from cyst(e) ine is catalyzed by three enzymes, cystathionine β synthase, cystathionase, and 3 -mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase. In the liver, kidney, enterocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, H 2 S is principally synthesized by cystathionase. In contrast, it is synthesized by cystathionine β synthase {{in the brain}} and partially by 3 -mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase in cardiac tissue. H 2 S is catabolized, essentially in mitochondria by thiosulfate reductase. The sulfite generated is then oxidized to sulfate by sulfite oxidase. The amount of thiosulfate excreted in the urine is the best indicator of H 2 S biosynthesis, together with sulfhemoglobin determination in erythrocytes. H 2 S acts as a neuromodulator in the brain, increasing responses mediated by NMDA receptors, facilitating the induction of long-term potentialization in the hippocampus. H 2 S also acts as a vasodilator, acting directly on ATP-dependent potassium channels in vascular smooth muscle cells. The concentration of H 2 S is abnormally low in the brains of subjects with Alzheimer’s disease, due to changes in the concentration of the physiological activator of cystathionine β synthase. The overproduction of H 2 S described in subjects with Down’s syndrome probably results from the overproduction of cystathionine β synthase, as the gene encoding this protein is located on chromosome 21...|$|R

40|$|L'élimination de la matière organique et la réduction de volume des boues peuvent être obtenues par incinération, par {{oxydation}} sous pression en milieu humide ("wet air oxidation") ou par combustion en eau supercritique ("supercritical water oxidation"). Une étude en autoclave agité a permis de comparer sur une même boue d'épuration les performances des deux techniques d'oxydation voie humide et d'oxydation supercritique, en mettant l'accent sur les sous-produits résiduels en phase liquide et la composition de la phase gaz. Les résultats obtenus montrent que l'élimination de la DCO dépend fortement de la température: l'abattement de la DCO passe de 70 % à 235 °C à 94 % à 430 °C. L'azote organique de la boue <b>est</b> <b>transformé</b> en NH 4 + mais seule une élimination limitée de l'azote totale est obtenue à 430 °C. Les sous-produits résiduels dans la phase liquide sont constitués en majorité d'acides gras, d'aldéhydes et de cétones, l'acide acétique étant prédominant. Hormis le CO 2, les sous-produits gazeux majeurs formés par des réactions complexes comme la pyrolyse, le réformage et la méthanation sont CO, H 2 et CH 4. Dans les conditions supercritiques, tous les sous-produits gazeux sont fortement oxydés. L'augmentation de la température de traitement permet d'obtenir un résidu solide de plus en plus inerte, les cendres obtenues en conditions supercritiques contenant moins de 1 % de matière organique. Les performances des deux procédés étudiés laissent envisager leur développement à moyen terme comme voies alternatives d'élimination des boues. ContextAs {{the number}} of wastewater treatment plants increases, and the efficiency of treatment improves, {{the problem of how}} to dispose of the ever increasing amounts of generated sludge has intensified. For the beginning of the next century 1 million tons of sludge will be produced annually in France; disposal in landfills will be impossible and agricultural use could be limited by tight quality standards. Therefore, the development of effective and acceptable sludge processes is urgently needed. Destruction of organic matter in sludge and large reductions in sludge volume are achieved either by incineration or by wet air oxidation (WAO), which needs no fuel and generates no smoke, fly ash or emissions of NOx and SO 2. Supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) offers an attractive alternative. Water, above its vapor-liquid critical point of 374 °C and 221 bar, is an excellent solvent for organic compounds and becomes completely miscible with oxygen. Reported results of sewage sludge SCWO demonstrate rapid and effective treatment. The objective of this study was to compare sub- and supercritical water oxidation of sludge in terms of organic matter destruction and formation of by-products in both gas and liquid phases. MethodologyOxidation of sludge was studied in a 0. 5 L batch reactor rated for 450 °C- 300 bar. The raw material was a biological sludge containing 4 % solids with a chemical oxygen demand (COD) value of 52 g/L. In the standard experimental procedure, 100 mL sludge were heated up to reaction temperature and oxygen was then introduced in 50 % excess with respect to COD. Heating was maintained during 1 hour before slow cooling to room temperature. The overall organic destruction was quantified in terms of total organic carbon (TOC) and COD. Gas and liquid phases sampled at room temperature after reaction were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). Sulfur and nitrogen species were also analyzed. ResultsWhen the temperature increased from 210 to 383 °C, COD destruction increased significantly (Table 1). At 383 °C, a COD destruction efficiency of 94. 3 % was obtained. However, at 430 °C, organic matter oxidation was only marginally improved. In WAO tests, considerable acetic acid was produced and remained in the substrate. The produced acetic acid was oxidized rapidly under SCWO conditions. Surprisingly, the concentrations of the other volatile fatty acids (VFA) remained approximately constant between 310 and 430 °C (Table 2). In addition to VFA, which represent ca. 50 % of the residual COD, oxygenated organic compounds such as aldehydes, ketones and alcohols were produced (Table 3). The data in Table 4 show that decomposition of organic nitrogen compounds into ammonia was completed at 383 °C, while nitrates were reduced to N 2 by reaction with organic matter and ammonia. NOx were not detected in the gas phase. The low reactivity of ammonia in supercritical water had been previously demonstrated. At 430 °C, ammonia removal from sludge was limited to 15 %. On the other hand, even in WAO conditions all sulfur species were totally converted to sulfate. Under subcritical conditions, the gas phase contained significant concentrations of hydrogen and carbon monoxide in addition to water, residual oxygen and carbon dioxide. Traces of methane and C 2 -C 3 hydrocarbons were also detected (Figs. 1 and 2). These gases result from a complex chemistry including pyrolysis, steam reforming and water-gas shift. Under supercritical conditions, all these compounds were extensively eliminated by oxidation. Under supercritical conditions the residual solids contained less than 1 % organic matter. By X-ray diffraction hydroxyapatite, quartz and kaliophilite were identified in the residual solids. These results confirm that supercritical water oxidation is a new sludge treatment concept of great interest. The degree of conversion of organic carbon is high, while liquid and especially gaseous by- products are produced in minor amounts compared to subcritical conditions. Temperatures higher than 430 °C would be needed for substantial nitrogen removal...|$|R

During thirteen years, many specimens were collected by the MNHN and collaborators in Pacific islands, including samples in all type localities. These specimens were compared and Coigene sequenced. Seven out of the eight species known to date were confirmed, while S. mystax is considered a synonym of S. leprurus. Moreover, Smilosicyopus species have a broader distribution than previously thought and endemicity seems to be not the main rule in this genus. A key to species is provided.

Plusieurs espèces de Smilosicyopus ont fina-lement une répartition plus large que celle qui était supposée initialement et l’endémicité n’est donc pas la règle principale chez ce genre.

Digital Preservation of Wolof Ajami Manuscripts of Senegal. Boston: Boston University Library: [URL] For Inquires: Please, contact Professor Fallou Ngom (fngom@bu. edu) The material is a program description of an international gathering of Murid organizations and disciples written in Wolofal (Wolof Ajami). The document is written in Wolofal because it is the primary means of written communication among Murids. It describes various religious, educational, and cultural activities in the program, including speeches, instructions (ndigal), conferences, films, and discussions on three key Sufi tenets (tarbiyya, tarqiyya, and tasfiyya). The material provides information on the organizations that took part in the meeting such as ASEM (Association des Etudiants Mourides) based in France, and the key leaders who participated in it such as Serigne Cheikh Ahmadou Mbacke, son of Serigne Moustapha Mbacke; Serigne Sarr Diop, President of ASEM; and Serigne Saliou Salam, among others. Based on the events discussed in the material, it was likely written in the 1980 s. Digitized on 13 July 2011. The document is in poor condition. Some pages are lost. The remaining ones have some stains and tears. Due to the age of the documents, some pages are hard to read, and the ink has faded away in some parts.

40|$|Background: The {{desert locust}} (Schistocerca gregaria) {{displays}} a fascinating type of phenotypic plasticity, designated as ‘phase polyphenism’. Depending on environmental conditions, one genome {{can be translated}} into two highly divergent phenotypes, termed the solitarious and gregarious (swarming) phase. Although many of the underlying molecular events remain elusive, {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) is expected to {{play a crucial role in}} the phase transition process. Locusts have also proven to be interesting model organisms in a physiological and neurobiological research context. However, molecular studies in locusts are hampered by the fact that genome/transcriptome sequence information available for this branch of insects is still limited. Methodology: We have generated 34, 672 raw expressed sequence tags (EST) from the CNS of desert locusts in both phases. These ESTs were assembled in 12, 709 unique transcript sequences and nearly 4, 000 sequences were functionally annotated. Moreover, the obtained <b>S.</b> gregaria <b>EST</b> information is highly complementary to the existing orthopteran transcriptomic data. Since many novel transcripts encode neuronal signaling and signal transduction components, this paper includes an overview of these sequences. Furthermore, several transcripts being differentially represented in solitarious and gregarious locusts were retrieved from this EST database. The findings highlight the involvement of the CNS in the phase transition process and indicate that this novel annotated database may also add to the emerging knowledge of concomitant neurona...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEukaryotic {{telomerase}} {{contains a}} telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and an RNA template component {{that are essential}} for telomerase catalytic activity and several other telomerase-associated factors of which only a few appear to be integral enzyme components [1 – 3]. The first essential telomerase protein identified was <b>S.</b> cerevisiae <b>Est</b> 1 p, whose deletion leads to ever-shorter telomeres despite the persistence of telomerase activity [4 – 6]. Extensive genetic and biochemical data show that Est 1 p, via its interaction with the telomerase RNA and telomere end DNA binding complex Cdc 13 p/Stn 1 p/Ten 1 p, promotes the ability of telomerase to elongate telomeres in vivo [7 – 22]. The characterization of Est 1 p homologs outside of yeast has not been documented. We report the characterization of two putative human homologs of Est 1 p, hEST 1 A and hEST 1 B. Both proteins specifically associated with telomerase activity in human cell extracts and bound hTERT in rabbit reticulocyte lysates independently of the telomerase RNA. Overproduction of hEST 1 A cooperated with hTERT to lengthen telomeres, an effect that was specific to cells containing telomerase activity. Like Est 1 p, hEST 1 A (but not hEST 1 B) exhibited a single-stranded telomere DNA binding activity. These {{results suggest that the}} telomerase-associated factor Est 1 p is evolutionarily conserved in humans...|$|R
