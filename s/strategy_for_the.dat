5|$|As {{commander}} of U.S. {{forces in the}} Philippines and Formosa, Radford accompanied President-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower on his three-day trip to Korea in December 1952. Eisenhower was looking for an exit <b>strategy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> stalemated and unpopular war, and Radford suggested threatening China with attacks on its Manchurian bases {{and the use of}} nuclear weapons. This view was shared by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and UNC Commander General Mark W. Clark, but had not been acted on when the armistice came in July 1953, {{at a time when the}} Chinese were struggling with domestic unrest. Still, Radford's frankness during the trip and his knowledge of Asia made a good impression on Eisenhower, who nominated Radford to be his Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.|$|E

5|$|Harold Lee George (July 19, 1893 – February 24, 1986) was an American {{aviation}} pioneer {{who helped}} shape {{and promote the}} concept of daylight precision bombing. An outspoken proponent of the industrial web theory, George taught at the Air Corps Tactical School and influenced a significant group of airmen passing through the school, ones who had powerful influence during and after World War II. He {{has been described as}} the leader of the Bomber Mafia, the men who advocated an independent military arm composed of heavy bombers. George helped shape America's bomber <b>strategy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> war by assisting Air War Plans Division with the development of a complete aircraft production and bombing strategy.|$|E

5|$|Rolling Thunder {{had begun}} as a {{campaign}} of psychological and strategic persuasion, but it changed very quickly to interdiction, a tactical mission. Its ultimate failure had two sources, both of which lay with the civilian and military policy-makers in Washington: first, neither group could ever conceive that the North Vietnamese would endure under the punishment that they would unleash upon it. The civilians, moreover, did not understand air power {{well enough to know}} that their policies might be crippling it; second, the American military leadership failed to initially propose and develop, or later to adapt, an appropriate <b>strategy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> war.|$|E

5|$|The Landing on Emirau was {{the last}} of the series of {{operations}} that made up Operation Cartwheel, General Douglas MacArthur's <b>strategy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> encirclement of the major Japanese base at Rabaul. A force of nearly 4,000 United States Marines landed on the island of Emirau on 20 March 1944. The island was not occupied by the Japanese and there was no fighting. It was developed into an airbase which formed the final link in the chain of bases surrounding Rabaul. The isolation of Rabaul permitted MacArthur to turn his attention westward and commence his drive along the north coast of New Guinea toward the Philippines.|$|E

A second link road, (the Northern Inner Distributor Road) planned for completion by the end of 2014 at a cost of £21 million, is still unfinished in 2016, with no completion in the near future.

5|$|The {{promotion}} <b>strategy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> film {{played on}} nationalist sentiment by announcing that La tragedia del silencio {{was the first}} authentically Colombian movie. It was first screened to the public on 18 July 1924 in Faenza theatre in Bogotá, attracting a large audience. There were several technical problems including power failure and projector errors, caused in particular by the nervousness of the director and his son, {{the director of the}} theatre Joaquín Francisco, and operator Gustavo Francisco. However, the film was well received by the public and the press, although some viewers complained about the poor image quality. The theatre was crowded during the seventeen showings of the film, but it was not very successful financially.|$|E
5|$|In January2014, Iwata {{unveiled}} a ten-year <b>strategy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> company based on {{quality of life}} products. The target was a new market outside video games. Developed under partnerships with Dr. Yasuyoshi Watanabe and ResMed, the first device in this initiative was a fatigue and sleep deprivation sensor announced in October2014. Unlike the Vitality Sensor, the sleep sensor {{was to be a}} stand-alone product that {{does not need to be}} worn. Following Iwata's death in July2015, analysts questioned whether Nintendo would continue the quality of life initiative. Despite a planned United States release in March2016, some suggested the product had been temporarily shelved, while others believed the product had been indefinitely postponed like the Vitality Sensor before it. The device was formally discontinued by February2016; however, Tatsumi Kimishima stated that research into quality of life products would continue.|$|E

5|$|The rift in the Democratic party {{caused by}} the primary was slow to heal; Boddy's {{supporters}} were reluctant to join Douglas's campaign, even with President Truman's encouragement. The President refused to campaign in California; he resented Democratic gubernatorial candidate James Roosevelt. Roosevelt, the eldest son of Franklin Roosevelt, had urged Democrats not to renominate Truman in 1948, but to instead nominate General Dwight Eisenhower. Fundraising {{continued to be a}} major problem for Douglas, the bulk of whose financial support came from labor unions. The weekend after the primary, Nixon campaign officials held a conference to discuss <b>strategy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> general election campaign. They decided on a fundraising goal of just over $197,000 (today, about $2,400,000). They were helped in that effort when Democratic Massachusetts Congressman John F. Kennedy, a political opponent of Nixon's, came to Nixon's office and gave him a donation of $1,000 on behalf of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr., his father. John Kennedy indicated that he could not endorse Nixon, but {{that he would not be}} heartbroken if Douglas was returned to her acting career. Joseph Kennedy later stated that he gave Nixon the money because Douglas was a communist.|$|E
5|$|War now {{broke out}} between Henry and his brothers. Henry mobilised a {{mercenary}} {{army in the}} west of Normandy, but as William Rufus and Robert's forces advanced, his network of baronial support melted away. Henry focused his remaining forces at Mont Saint-Michel, where he was besieged, probably in March 1091. The site was easy to defend, but lacked fresh water. The chronicler William of Malmesbury suggested that when Henry's water ran short, Robert allowed his brother fresh supplies, leading to remonstrations between Robert and William Rufus. The events of {{the final days of}} the siege are unclear: the besiegers had begun to argue about the future <b>strategy</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> campaign, but Henry then abandoned Mont Saint-Michel, probably as part of a negotiated surrender.
