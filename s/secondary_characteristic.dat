5000|$|The {{disease is}} linked to the {{bloodline}} of the famous American Quarter Horse stallion Impressive, who has over 55,000 living descendants [...] Although the disease is primarily limited to the American Quarter Horse and closely related breeds such as American Paint Horses and Appaloosas at this time, cross-breeding has begun to extend it to crossbreds recognized by other breed registries as well as grade horses. Until the AQHA restricted the registration of animals with the condition, the spread of the disease was perpetuated by the favorable placings given to affected horses in halter competition at horse shows, because a <b>secondary</b> <b>characteristic</b> associated with N/H and H/H horses is heavy, bulky muscling that is favored by stock horse judges, a trend that began with Impressive and predates the modern understanding of the disease. Some stock horse breeds with Quarter Horse bloodlines have yet to restrict registration in order to limit the perpetuation of HYPP.|$|E

5000|$|This {{left the}} {{language}} with two redundant series of consonants and a complementary set of contrasting vowels for each consonant series, effectively doubling {{the number of}} vowel nuclei in the language. The formerly voiced stops {{are referred to as}} [...] "high register" [...] while the formerly voiceless stops are called [...] "low register". Each vowel symbol, which in Old and Early Middle Khmer had a single value, after restructuring is pronounced differently depending on the register of the preceding consonant symbol. The <b>secondary</b> <b>characteristic</b> of breathy phonation in the high register became redundant with the development of contrasting vowels for each series and was gradually lost in most dialects by the modern era. Breathy voice versus clear voice still contrast in Western Khmer and breathy voice in some high register vowels may still be heard in Central Khmer but it is incidental and conveys no lexical meaning; speakers are unaware of it.|$|E
5000|$|The phonological {{inventory}} of the earliest Middle Khmer closely resembles that of Old Khmer. The consonants and vowels of the language before the major sound changes occurred are listed below. The voiced implosives [...] and [...] may have contrasted with [...] and , which is rather rare, or the two sets may have evolved during different stages of Middle Khmer and never have contrasted. The vowels in parentheses are assumed to {{have been used in}} early Middle Khmer but this has never been proved nor disproved. In addition to the vowel nuclei listed, there were two diphthongs inherited from Old Khmer, iə and uə, and a third, ɨə, entered the language via loanwords from Thai. The impetus for the major changes that took place during Middle Khmer was the devoicing of the Old Khmer voiced stops. Unlike the modern language, Old Khmer contrasted voiced stops /g/, /ɟ/, /d/, /b/ with unvoiced /k/, /c/, /t/, and /p/ and had a simple vowels system consisting of eight or nine long monophthongs with short counterparts and two diphthongs. As voicing was gradually lost and the two stop series merged, contrast shifted to the following vowels. Vowels following formerly voiced consonants remained unchanged in quality but the voicing was transferred to the vowel giving a <b>secondary</b> <b>characteristic</b> breathy phonation. Vowels following the originally voiceless stops were lowered. In most cases the lowering resulted in a process of diphthongization which began with on-glides and, as the shift progressed, the on-glide became the focus of a new vowel nucleus. In words with /aː/, which can't be lowered, it was the vowel following the formerly voiced consonants that diphthongized.|$|E
40|$|Developing ideas {{based on}} {{combinatorial}} formulas for characteristic classes we introduce the algebra modeling <b>secondary</b> <b>characteristic</b> classes associated to $N$ connections.

We write how $i$-th differential and $i$-th homotopy operator in the algebra are connected with the Poisson bracket defined in this algebra. There is an analogy between this algebra and the noncommutative symplectic geometry of Kontsevich. We consider then an algebraic model of {{the action of the}} gauge group. We describe how elements in the algebra corresponding to the <b>secondary</b> <b>characteristic</b> classes change under this action. Comment: 22 page...|$|E
