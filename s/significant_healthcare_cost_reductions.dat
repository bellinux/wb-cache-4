In this work, we propose a guidance approach that uses real-time MRI to assist the operator in performing robot-assisted procedure in a beating heart. Specifically, this approach provides both real-time visualization and force-feedback based guidance for maneuvering an interventional tool safely inside the dynamic environment of a heart’s left ventricle. Experimental evaluation of the functionality of this approach was tested on a simulated scenario of transapical aortic valve replacement and it demonstrated improvement in control and manipulation by providing effective and accurate assistance to the operator in real-time.

There are 2 general approaches to managing AF: the first is to attempt to restore and maintain sinus rhythm (the so-called “rhythm-control ” approach); the second is to leave patients in AF while minimizing their symptoms and pre-venting deterioration of ventricular function by controlling the ventricular response rate (the “rate-control ” approach). Although the former approach is theoretically preferable be-cause it normalizes cardiac electrical function, sinus rhythm can be maintained in only about 25 % of patients without long-term antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Antiarrhythmic drugs have a variety of potentially significant adverse effects and are only moderately effective in maintaining sinus rhythm; therefore, it has been argued by some that rate con...|$|R

Evidence suggests that short-course antimicrobial therapy can be as effective as standard duration therapy (> 7 days) in treating exacerbations. Randomized trials have shown that clinical and bacteriological success rates are comparable with both 5 -day and standard antibiotic courses. Furthermore, 5 -day fluoroquinolone therapy is associated with faster recovery, fewer relapses, prolonged duration between episodes, and less hospitalization when compared with standard therapy.

40|$|AbstractThe {{natural history}} of Crohn's Disease and {{ulcerative}} colitis is characterized by repeated episodes of inflammation and ulceration of the bowel. This results in complications implying a worse {{quality of life and}} <b>significant</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>costs,</b> due to hospitalization, surgery and an escalation of therapy. The main goal of the therapy in inflammatory bowel disease is to achieve and maintain disease remission, with an improved health-related quality of life, less hospitalization, and less surgery. The concept of remission has changed in the recent years. In fact the concept of clinical remission, where only the patients’ symptoms are in remission, has been replaced by the new concept of deep remission. This implies not only sustained clinical remission but also complete mucosal healing, with the normalization of serological activity indexes. Mucosal healing, rarely achieved with traditional drugs, can now be achieved and maintained by means of biological drugs. Current evidence suggests that the achievement of mucosal healing might significantly change the natural course of inflammatory bowel diseases and should represent an objective end point of future therapeutic trials, particularly for colonic diseases...|$|R

Cardiac regenerative therapy, whereby pro-regenerative cells, drugs or growth factors are administered to damaged and ischaemic myocardium has demonstrated significant potential, especially preclinically. While some of these strategies have demonstrated a measure of success in clinical trials, tangible clinical translation has been slow. To date, the majority of clinical studies and a significant number of preclinical studies have utilised relatively simple delivery methods for regenerative therapeutics, such as simple systemic administration or local injection in saline carrier vehicles. Here, we review cardiac regenerative strategies with a particular focus on advanced delivery concepts as a potential means to enhance treatment efficacy and tolerability and ultimately, clinical translation. These include (i) delivery of therapeutic agents in biomaterial carriers, (ii) nanoparticulate encapsulation, (iii) multimodal therapeutic strategies and (iv) localised, minimally invasive delivery via percutaneous transcatheter systems...|$|R

Chronic viral hepatitis in Central Florida is presented to illustrate the need for DMOs that have a centralised structure, provide a platform for data acquisition through patient evaluation and diagnosis and provide both immediate treatment recommendations and long-term health monitoring. Unless surgery or an emergency requires acute care, this paper suggests building local capacity in terms of DMOs for managing chronic illness versus hospital management, on the premise that separate facilities can provide more cost-effective and defined treatment for the compounding aspects of chronic disease, to achieve the best outcomes for patients. hospitals, disease management organisations, DMOs, local capacity building, chronic viral hepatitis, chronic illness, healthcare informatics research, national treatment models, <b>healthcare</b> <b>cost</b> <b>reduction,</b> chronic diseases, long-term care, managed care, USA, United States, hospital management,...|$|R

EPF, {{and the related}} diseases pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and pemphigus foliaceus (PF), are characterized by skin lesions and autoantibodies to molecules found on epidermal keratinocytes. A variant of EPF in patients from El Bagre, Colombia, South America, has recently {{been reported to be}} distinct from previously described loci in Brazil and Tunisia epidemiologically and immunologically. As in PF and EPF, El Bagre EPF patients exhibit autoantibodies towards desmoglein- 1, a cell adhesion molecule critical for maintaining epidermal integrity. An association of El Bagre EPF with sun exposure has been detected, and ultraviolet irradiation also exacerbates symptoms in PV, PF and EPF. Our hypothesis is that: (1) the autoantibodies generate pathology through an alteration in ceramide metabolism in targeted keratinocytes, resulting in apoptosis and/or cell death and acantholysis, but only when the cell&# 39;s ability to metabolize ceramide is exceeded, and (2) apoptosis in response to this altered ceramide metabolism is initiated and/or exacerbated by other agents that increase ceramide levels, such as cytokines, ultraviolet irradiation, and senescence...|$|R

Given that population-based interventions that increase and maintain PA levels may be more successful than those aimed at long-term weight loss, 7 the possibility that PA may obviate the increased risk of AF associated with weight gain and obesity warrants further investigation.

Chemical carcinogens can undergo metabolic activation and detoxification in the liver and polymorphisms in the relevant genes {{have been shown to be}} associated with bladder cancer risk. In addition, DNA repair enzymes are required to repair the DNA damage associated with carcinogen exposure. The main pathways involved are nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, and double strand break repair. Investigation of individual polymorphisms in DNA repair genes in bladder cancer has yielded few robust positive findings, which is not surprising given the multifactorial nature of the disease. Pathway approaches using novel genotyping technologies will allow more comprehensive studies of multiple polymorphisms in multiple genes. It will also be possible to investigate gene-environment interaction more rigorously than heretofore, using novel statistical methodology, in larger studies and through collaborative efforts within consortia. The results of the genome-wide association studies in bladder cancer are awaited with interest. In the future, genetic tests might be used in the prevention of bladder cancer to encourage lifestyle changes in those at highest risk of developing the disease, and in the treatment of bladder cancer to optimise cure rates whilst minimising morbidity in a cost-effective manner...|$|R
40|$|Given {{on behalf}} of Dr. Elizabeth Phillips, Dr. Mallal {{presents}} pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics in clinical practice. Polymorphisms in both hosts and pathogens constitute a large challenge in therapy. Pathogenic adaptability, as seen in HIV, will shape the response to particular drug interventions. Similarly, the host genetic makeup will also affect the response to treatment. Drugs therefore help us elucidate these polymorphic backgrounds. Pharmacogenetics refers to a clinical entity (phenotype) that is further characterized by genetics (genotype). Conversely, pharmacogenomics attempts to identify the genotype in order to predict {{the risk of developing}} a particular phenotype. Pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic approaches in choosing an optimal antiretroviral regimen are exemplified in abacavir hypersensitivity reactions. Clinical diagnosis of abacavir hypersensitivity has been shown to yield false positives (CNA 3005, CNA 30024). This over diagnosis subsequently leads to prompt discontinuation of abacavir which incurs <b>significant</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>costs.</b> A study by Dr. Phillips and colleagues (2005) demonstrated that disrupting treatment too early resulted in increased consultations with emergency physicians and/or specialists with higher costs for services. Furthermore, it took longer for these patients to achieve undetectable viral loads. Studies show that abacavir hypersensitivity can be more accurately diagnosed with the patch test. Dr. Mallal reiterates the differences between pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics by pointing out that patch testing should be employed in abacavir sensitized individuals, therefore serving as a diagnostic test and not a predictive test...|$|R
40|$|Depression {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of {{disability}} worldwide, contributing to high medical expenditures, poor clinical outcomes, low productivity, and compromised quality of life. Efficacious treatments are available for the treatment of depression across a broad age range (children/adolescents to elderly). Care management initiatives that include these promising interventions ameliorate the impact of the disorder among patients receiving mental health services in primary care and behavioral healthcare settings. Part I of this two-part article series provides the reader with an overview of issues related to improving the treatment of depression. The approaches used to treat depression and strategies employed to evaluate treatment success are critical. Disease management is one strategy used for improving depression treatment that benefits the consumer and yields positive results for providers and payors. The most effective strategies are those with multiple components, including patient education, coordination of care between primary care and mental health specialists, and ongoing evaluation and feedback. Although the benefits of such interventions are profound in producing improvements in depressive symptoms, social and emotional functioning, and overall satisfaction, there have been few healthcare systems that have successfully integrated such programs into routine care. Despite indirect advantages to providers and payors, the costs of implementing such programs may present a larger barrier to system-wide adoption of disease management for depression. Certainly, the potential for <b>healthcare</b> <b>cost</b> <b>reductions</b> needs to be systematically examined, particularly the extent to which certain patient groups (the most interesting being those with the highest <b>healthcare</b> <b>costs</b> or catastrophic outcomes of their depression) will benefit from disease management programs.

Abdominal pain {{is the most common}} symptom in CP patients and the development of CP is challenging medical practice. It has been proposed that a combination of genetic, environmental, and metabolic risk factors contribute to the pain patterns in CP patients and development of CP. This research aimed to introduce a new data analytic strategy Random Forests (RF) to support big data analysis in studying CP and epidemiological researches. RF has been becoming a popular non-parametric algorithm in computational method and used in many scientific areas in the context of big data era. RF is an ensemble of individual decision trees to help explore data structure and hidden information in high dimensional data. RF could deal with correlated predictor variables and integrates complex interaction effects during modeling process to evaluate the entire effects of all predictor variables on outcome variable and produce estimates of importance scores for all predictor variables. In this work, a framework of combining RF analyses with traditional statistical analyses was developed to investigate important risk factors associated with different pain patterns in patients with CP and disease progression from recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP) to CP. The public health significance of this novel analytic method is that it successfully examined a large amount of predictor variables in a multivariable way and would help researchers to better understand complex mechanisms in CP. ...|$|R

Methods: We selected 'Diagnosis-Related Groups' (DRG) of disorders {{that are associated with}} chronic abdominal pain from a large teaching hospital and a tertiary referral centre. For each DRG we determined the percentage of patients that can present with abdominal pain. The total costs for both hospitals were calculated using the registered quantity of the DRGs. Each DRG was categorised by somatic and functional origin. The results were subsequently extrapolated to the entire Dutch population demanding hospital care for chronic abdominal pain. Finally, the percentage and associated costs were calculated for patients who had two or more separate diagnoses for chronic abdominal pain in the field of gastroenterology, gynaecology, internal medicine and urology. Results: The yearly outpatient and (day) clinical health costs for patients with chronic abdominal pain in the Netherlands were approximately € 623 million (gastroenterology € 226 million; gynaecology € 303 million; internal medicine € 63 million; and urology € 31 million). Of these diagnoses, 53. 6 % were related to functional disorders, which accounts for approximately € 220 million per year. The yearly costs of patients who had at least two separate diagnoses within one year for chronic abdominal pain were estimated at € 23. 5 million per year.

MethodsSummary of the Clinical Practice Guidelines of the UK Joint Royal Colleges Ambulance Liaison Committee relating to the management of seizures. Review of the literature relating to pre-hospital management of seizure emergencies. ResultsMuch standard practice relating to the emergency out of hospital management of patients with seizures is drawn from generic Advanced Life Support (ALS) guidelines although many patients do not need ALS during or after a seizure and the benefit of many ALS interventions in seizure patients remains to be established. The majority of studies identified pertain to medical treatment of status epilepticus. These papers show that benzodiazepines are safe and effective but it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions about the best medication or the optimal route of administration. ConclusionThe evidence base for current pre-hospital guidelines for seizure emergencies is incomplete. A large proportion of patients are transported to hospital after a seizure but many of these may be suitable for home management. However, there is very little research into alternative care pathways or criteria that could be used to help paramedics avoid transport to hospital.

When a disease outbreak is detected, identifying the contaminated food quickly is vital to minimize suffering and limit economic losses. Here we present a likelihood-based approach that has the potential to accelerate the time needed to identify possibly contaminated food products, which is based on exploitation of food products sales data and the distribution of foodborne illness case reports. Using a real world food sales data set and artificially generated outbreak scenarios, we show that this method performs very well for contamination scenarios originating from a single "guilty" food product. As it is neither always possible nor necessary to identify the single offending product, the method has been extended such that it {{can be used as a}} binary classifier. With this extension it is possible to generate a set of potentially "guilty" products that contains the real outbreak source with very high accuracy. Furthermore we explore the patterns of food distributions that lead to "hard-to-identify" foods, the possibility of identifying these food groups a priori, and the extent to which the likelihood-based method can be used to quantify uncertainty. We find that high spatial correlation of sales data between products may be a useful indicator for "hard-to-identify" products...|$|R

In previous work, we designed a bespoke delirium prevention intervention, called ‘Stop Delirium!’ In preparation for a definitive trial of Stop Delirium, we sought to address key aspects of trial design for the particular circumstances of care homes. Design: a cluster randomized feasibility study with an embedded process evaluation. Setting and participants: residents of 14 care homes for older people in one metropolitan district in the UK. Intervention: Stop Delirium!: a 16 -month-enhanced educational package to support care home staff to address key delirium risk factors. Control homes received usual care. Measurements: we collected data to determine the following: recruitment and attrition; delirium rates and variability between homes; feasibility of measuring delirium, resource use, quality of life, hospital admissions and falls; and intervention implementation and adherence. Results: two-thirds (215) of eligible care home residents were recruited. One-month delirium prevalence was 4. 0 % in intervention and 7. 1 % in control homes.

The aromatase inhibitors (Als) have become the new and alternative modalities of endocrine treatment for post-menopausal women with oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, as a result of promising data from randomised trials in metastatic and locally advanced breast cancers. Recently, the results from several large, randomised, controlled adjuvant trials have provided further evidence that the use of Als, either as initial treatment or sequentially after tamoxifen, improves disease-free survival and, in certain patients, overall survival. With relatively short-term follow-up, the use of Als {{has been shown to be}} safe and welltolerated. Nevertheless, some detrimental adverse effects, particularly skeletal-related events or cardiovascular disease, remain important issues of concern and warrant continued monitoring and follow-up. The optimal use of Als, the appropriate timing of treatment, and the superiority of individual agents are under investigation. Use of Als in women with chemotherapy-induced amenorrhoea should be cautious due to the possibility of return of ovarian function. Cost-effectiveness and quality of life remain issues of interest since the high and ever increasing incidence of breast cancer has contributed to <b>significant</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>costs</b> and patients with breast cancer following appropriate treatment are living longer but not necessarily being cured of their diseases.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Chronic {{hepatitis}} {{because of}} the hepatitis C virus (CHC) is a major health problem {{that can lead to}} decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and eventually death, all of which are associated with <b>significant</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>costs.</b> AIM: To update the cost of care of CHC according to the different severity stages of the disease in a west European country (Belgium). METHODS: Medical records of 157 patients, who were referred to the medical specialist at different stages of disease, were reviewed to identify the medical costs over a follow-up period of 3 years or 2 years in the case of liver transplantation (LT). Six disease stages were defined on the basis of histology (Metavir classification) and/or clinical data. RESULTS: In comparison with mild disease, the cost increased 1. 6 times in the case of decompensated cirrhosis, 1. 9 times in the case of hepatocellular carcinoma, and 3. 4 in the case of LT. The costs for medication, hospitalization, and ambulatory care were, respectively, on the one hand, 81, 8, and 11 % for mild disease and, on the other, 18, 79, and 3 % for LT. In the case of a sustained viral response, the cost of follow-up within 3 years decreased by 45 % for patients with mild and moderate disease. CONCLUSION: Antiviral treatment is the most important factor governing cost in mild and moderate disease, but once complications of CHC occur, hospitalization costs far exceed the cost of antiviral therapy. Already during the first 3 years of follow-up, sustained viral response decreased the cost significantly. Treatment of patients with CHC in an early stage {{has the potential to be}} cost-effective. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV- 2) is {{a sexually}} {{transmitted}} virus {{that is highly}} prevalent worldwide, causing a range of symptoms that result in <b>significant</b> <b>healthcare</b> <b>costs</b> and human suffering. ACAM 529 is a replication-defective vaccine candidate prepared by growing the previously described dl 5 - 29 on a cell line appropriate for GMP manufacturing. This vaccine, when administered subcutaneously, was previously shown to protect mice from a lethal vaginal HSV- 2 challenge and to afford better protection than adjuvanted glycoprotein D (gD) in guinea pigs. Here we show that ACAM 529 given via the intramuscular route affords significantly greater immunogenicity and protection in comparison with subcutaneous administration in the mouse vaginal HSV- 2 challenge model. Further, we describe a side-by-side comparison of intramuscular ACAM 529 with a gD vaccine {{across a range of}} challenge virus doses. While differences in protection against death are not significant, ACAM 529 protects significantly better against mucosal infection, reducing peak challenge virus shedding at the highest challenge dose by over 500 -fold versus 5 -fold for gD. Over 27 % (11 / 40) of ACAM 529 -immunized animals were protected from viral shedding while 2. 5 % (1 / 40) were protected by the gD vaccine. Similarly, 35 % (7 / 20) of mice vaccinated with ACAM 529 were protected from infection of their dorsal root ganglia while none of the gD-vaccinated mice were protected. These results indicate that measuring infection of the vaginal mucosa and of dorsal root ganglia over a range of challenge doses is more sensitive than evaluating survival at a single challenge dose as a means of directl...|$|R
