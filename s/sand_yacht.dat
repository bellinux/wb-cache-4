50|$|By sailing {{downwind}} at 135° off the wind, a <b>sand</b> <b>yacht</b> can sail {{much faster}} than the wind. The velocity made good downwind is often over twice as fast compared to the same land yacht sailing directly downwind. In 2009, the world land speed record for a wind-powered vehicle was set by the <b>sand</b> <b>yacht</b> Greenbird sailing at about three times {{the speed of the}} wind with a recorded top speed of 202.9 km/h.|$|E
5000|$|Surf boards, surfing {{tuition and}} <b>sand</b> <b>yachts</b> are {{available}} for hire at the Muriwai Surf School near the beach.|$|R
5000|$|Hoylake, {{in north}} west Wirral {{is one of}} the premier European land sailing (<b>sand</b> <b>yachting)</b> sites, and was host to the week-long European Championships in September 2007 and again in 2011.|$|R
50|$|A sailing craft {{can travel}} {{directly}} downwind {{only at a}} speed that {{is less than the}} wind speed. However, a variety of sailing craft can achieve a higher downwind speed made good by traveling on a series of broad reaches, punctuated by jibes in between. This is true of ice boats and <b>sand</b> <b>yachts.</b> On the water it was explored by sailing vessels, starting in 1975, and now extends to high-performance skiffs, catamarans and foiling sailboats.|$|R
50|$|Hoylake {{is one of}} {{the premier}} sites for sand {{yachting}} in Britain, with banks around {{a quarter of a mile}} offshore. The town's beach was the venue for the European <b>Sand</b> <b>Yacht</b> Championships in 2007 and 2011 and will share the 2017 event with Laytown & Bettystown, County Meath.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Standart" [...] Class {{is unique}} {{in that it is}} the only {{recognised}} international monotype <b>sand</b> <b>yacht</b> with all yachts being identical. Not dissimilar to Class 5 in shape and function, they must follow a special design supplied by the French manufacturer Seagull. This class is widely popular because it means the outcome of a competition rests entirely with the pilot, as the yacht itself cannot provide an advantage or disadvantage.|$|E
50|$|Class 7 yachts {{are built}} like skateboards with a sail, {{much like a}} land-borne windsurfing board. These are also called Speed Sail (A {{registered}} trademark by Norbert Blanc, a French inventor who made successful adaptation of a windsurfer sail on an enlarged skateboard, with special wheels and improved axles, {{in the wake of}} the 1980' windsurfing craze) and are fully recognised by FISLY as part of <b>sand</b> <b>yacht</b> clubs, they are also sailed for fun and hobby.|$|E
2500|$|Land sailing {{has evolved}} from a novelty, since the 1950s, [...] {{primarily}} into a sport. The vehicles used in sailing are known as land or <b>sand</b> <b>yachts.</b> They typically have three (sometimes four) wheels and function much like a sailboat, except that they are operated from a sitting or lying position and steered by pedals or hand levers. Land sailing is best suited for windy flat areas; races often take place on beaches, airfields, and dry lake beds in desert regions.|$|R
5000|$|Loosely {{modelled}} on the Americas Cup {{series for}} yachts, {{it started in}} 1961 after UK catamaran designer Rod McAlpine-Downey became aware of a challenge from America that claimed they had [...] "the fastest sailboat". Rod answered the challenge and simple rules were agreed. The challenge had {{to come from a}} recognized yacht club and consequently was taken up by John Fisk on behalf of the Chapman <b>Sands</b> <b>Yacht</b> Club of which he was Commodore and friend of Rod. The challenge was successful and the trophy went to the UK where it stayed for 8 years.|$|R
50|$|During World War II the sea {{front was}} {{disrupted}} by {{the installation of}} the Nazi Atlantic Wall and the town suffered from bombing during the allied invasion in 1944. This contributed to the diminishing of the ancient fishing industry, which numbered some 150 boats {{at the turn of the}} century, and had all but disappeared by the 1960s. Today, although the hospital sector remains economically important, the town has again promoted itself as a tourist attraction. A seaside bathing station, with an immense beach of fine sand on the Opal Coast, it continues to be a centre for <b>sand</b> <b>yachting</b> and the new sport of surfboarding. The former Berck Plage railway station has been converted into a casino.|$|R
50|$|From the {{detailed}} data {{provided for the}} 2009 record set by a <b>sand</b> <b>yacht,</b> {{it can be seen}} that the record was achieved when the yacht's course was about 120° off the true wind. That is, the yacht was moving faster than the wind although the true wind was behind it. This is possible because the speed of the yacht results in a large forward wind shift, so that the yacht is close hauled with respect to the apparent wind.|$|E
5000|$|The basic {{definition}} of a miniyacht is [...] "Any assembled land or <b>sand</b> <b>yacht</b> that fits inside a continuous loop of rope 5.6 m long is a miniyacht". Some designs of mini yachts can be dismantled and carried {{in the trunk of}} a car. They can be sailed equally well by small children and large adults and have the added advantage of going on grass as well as sand or concrete. These yachts are very usable and they are a truly fun inexpensive class for all the family popular in Europe, America, Australia, New Zealand, UK and Ireland.|$|E
5000|$|Massarde {{decides to}} send them to Tebezza, a secret gold mine shared with General Kazim, where prisoners dig for gold under appalling conditions. Here they also find the WHO team, which had been coming too close to the truth about the {{diseases}} they were investigating, as well as the French engineers that were contracted to build the processing facility. Dirk and Al manage to escape from the mine, driving 300 km to the east, trying to reach the Trans-Sahara Route. When the gas runs out, they have to walk. They find a cave painting of a Civil War-era monitor, which local artists could not have drawn in such detail without having seen it. They also find a lost 1930s-era airplane, which they rebuild into a <b>sand</b> <b>yacht.</b> They determine that the crashed airplane had been flown by legendary record-breaking Australian pilot Kitty Mannock, whose disappearance was worldwide news at the time, overshadowed only by that of Amelia Earhart. Mannock's body is lying with the plane, along with her diary, which details her attempts at walking out, her discovery of [...] "an odd ship in the sand", her taking shelter inside the ship, and her eventual return to her plane in a vain hope for rescue. Mannock had survived for ten days, and by her diary they were able to know how long she walked from the plane, and in which direction, giving them an area to search for the lost ironclad. Using the <b>sand</b> <b>yacht</b> they built from Mannock's plane, they finally reach the Trans-Sahara Route and are picked up by a passing truck on the way to Adrar, Algeria. They quickly reach Algiers, from where they inform Admiral Sandecker about the appalling situation in Tebezza.|$|E
5000|$|Vehicles used in sailing {{are known}} as sail wagons, <b>sand</b> <b>yachts,</b> or land yachts. They {{typically}} have three (sometimes four) wheels and function much like a sailboat, except that they are operated from a sitting or lying position and steered by pedals or hand levers. Land sailing works best in windy flat areas, and races often happen on beaches, airfields, and dry lake beds in desert regions. Modern land sailors, generally known as [...] "pilots", can go {{three to four times}} faster than the wind speed. A gust of wind is considered more beneficial in a land sailing race than a favorable windshift. A similar sport, known as ice yachting, is practiced on frozen lakes and rivers. Another variation is the Whike, which combines land sailing with bicycling and can therefore also be used in everyday traffic because it does not fully depend on wind.|$|R
5000|$|The International {{governing}} {{body for the}} sport of land and Sandyachting was formed in 1962 [...] The Federation International de <b>Sand</b> et Land <b>Yachting</b> ( [...] FISLY [...] ) has member countries {{from around the world}} and has divided the sporting side of the activity into various classes. There are a number of basic types, or [...] "classes", of land yachts. Because of the very different nature of each class, they compete separately in races. The largest class of yachts are known as Class 2, which may have masts as large as 8 m. The massive sail area provides significant power, although the speed of Class 2 yachts can sometimes be limited by their large size these are sailed mainly in continental Europe and USA.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the largest}} {{international}} events in the sport are the European championships, in which competitors of all classes from all over Europe travel to a sand yachting venue for a week-long competition. The Wirral <b>Sand</b> <b>Yacht</b> Club, on Hoylake beach, hosted the event in September 2007. Rada Tilly hosted the World Championship XI in February 2008, an event that was first developed in Argentina and in South America.. St Peter Ording was the venue for the 2009 European Championships.De Panne in Belgium hosted the 2010 World Championships. The 2011 European Championships were held in Hoylake on the Wirral peninsula near Liverpool. Attendees included local politicians Esther McVey and Stephen Hesford, alongside the Mayor of Wirral, the Head of the International Governing body for Sandyachting, and {{at least some of}} the 150 competitors from Argentina, France, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, Sweden Italy, Ireland, Chile, Denmark, USA, Australia and the UK. 2012 saw the World Championships being held in Cherreuix, Brittany France in a beautiful area just in the shadow of the world heritage site Mont Saint Michel. The event catered for all FISLY classes and 350 competitors family and friends participated over the 8 Days. 2013 Europeans were held in St Peter Ording Germany.|$|E
50|$|The {{beach to}} the north of St Anne's Pier was an internationally renowned sand {{yachting}} location for many years, but sand yachting has been suspended since 2002, when a visitor to the beach died after being hit by a <b>sand</b> <b>yacht.</b> St Annes Beach also hosts a number of kite flying events each year. In 2006 kite enthusiasts raised concerns about the future of these activities following a decision by Fylde Borough Council in 2006 to ban the flying of kites with two or more lines anywhere in the Fylde. Following representations from kite-fliers and completion of a risk assessment, the council rescinded the ban on condition that kite fliers remain at least 50m from the sand dunes. A memorial statue of a lifeboatman looking out to sea was placed on the promenade at St Annes after the Mexico Disaster of 1886. The original lifeboat station was established in 1881 but closed in 1925 due to silting of the channel (a secondary channel of the Ribble that ran past the pier). A lifeboat continued to operate from Lytham, but the main channel of the River Ribble also became silted up, so the lifeboat was moved to a new all-weather RNLI base a few hundred yards south of St Annes pier which opened in 2000. St Annes-on-the-Sea Carnegie Library is situated just outside the town centre in an Edwardian, Carnegie-funded building.|$|E
