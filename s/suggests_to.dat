5|$|Antigonus entered Sparta triumphantly, {{its first}} foreign conqueror. Nevertheless, he treated the {{population}} generously and humanely. He ordered that the reforms of Cleomenes be revoked, and restored the ephors, {{although he did}} not force Sparta to join the League. However, Antigonus' failure to restore the Spartan Kings <b>suggests</b> <b>to</b> historian Graham Shipley that this restoration of laws was a sham. Within three days, he left Sparta and returned to Macedon to deal with a Dardani invasion, leaving a garrison in Acrocorinth and Orchomenos. With Cleomenes' defeat, Sparta's power collapsed and it fell into the hands of successive tyrants.|$|E

At Grout's mansion, the fledgling sees Nines leaving and discovers Grout's remains in the mansion with vampire hunter Grunfeld Bach, who denies involvement in Grout's death. Learning about Nines' presence at the mansion, LaCroix tells the other chiefs to approve Nines' execution. The fledgling is sent to the Museum of Natural History to recover the sarcophagus, but finds that it has been stolen. Jack later <b>suggests</b> <b>to</b> the fledgling that LaCroix wants the sarcophagus to drink the blood of the ancient within, gaining its power.|$|E
5|$|Initially making only {{tentative}} forays onto land, tetrapods {{adapted to}} terrestrial environments {{over time and}} spent longer periods away from the water. It {{is also possible that}} the adults started to spend some time on land (as the skeletal modifications in early tetrapods such as Ichthyostega <b>suggests)</b> <b>to</b> bask in the sun close to the water's edge, while otherwise being mostly aquatic.|$|E
5|$|Oslac's origins {{are unclear}} and no {{specific}} relationship with any previous known figure {{can be established}} from available sources. Oslac's name <b>suggests</b> <b>to</b> some historians {{that he was a}} Norseman. Dorothy Whitelock points out that the name Oslac is often an anglicisation of the Old Scandinavian name Áslákr, while the writers of the Biographical Dictionary of Dark Age Britain entry on Oslac comment that the name suggests an origin in the Danelaw, a suggestion supported by the fact that Thored, Oslac's son, held lands in Cambridgeshire.|$|E

5|$|The next morning, Mulder shows Scully some tracks by {{the front}} door of the house that appear to be human. Based on the weight distribution, however, the assailant evidently travels on the balls of its feet rather than from heel to toe. Additionally, that the {{creature}} lured the mother out of the house in order to get to Louis <b>suggests</b> <b>to</b> Mulder that the creatures are paranormal in nature.|$|E
5|$|The shared {{repetitive}} {{nature of}} the phrasing of the texts, apart from Gv and I, <b>suggests</b> <b>to</b> Pozdniakov {{that they are not}} integral texts, and cannot contain the varied contents which would be expected for history or mythology. In the following table of characters in the Pozdniakov & Pozdniakov inventory, ordered by descending frequency, the first two rows of 26 characters account for 86% of the entire corpus.|$|E

5|$|After {{watching}} an advertisement on television for Duff Gardens, Homer, Bart and Lisa decide to go. As they prepare to leave, Marge tells them that spinster Great Aunt Gladys died {{and they will}} be going to her funeral instead. The Simpsons, along with Patty and Selma, drive to Littleneck Falls to attend her funeral and the reading of her will. On the video will, Great Aunt Gladys tells Patty and Selma not to die alone, as she did. Selma hears the ticking of her biological clock, and decides she wants a child. Selma tries video dating, but gets rejected by Groundskeeper Willie. She goes to a psychic who tries to sell her a love potion. The psychic ingests it, blurts out the innocuous ingredients and discovers that she accidentally drank a truth serum. Selma dates Hans Moleman after revoking his license at the DMV.

5|$|Agnes D'Mello, the NDC's head {{of human}} resources, <b>suggests</b> <b>to</b> Vidya {{that her husband}} resembled former {{employee}} Milan Damji (Indraneil Sengupta), whose file is probably kept in the old NDC office. Before Agnes can provide any further help she is killed by Bob Biswas (Saswata Chatterjee), an assassin working undercover as a life insurance agent. Vidya and Rana break into the NDC office and find Damji's file, barely escaping an encounter with Bob, who is searching for the same information. Meanwhile, the attempts to obtain Damji's records have {{attracted the attention of}} two Intelligence Bureau (IB) officials in Delhi—the chief Bhaskaran K. (Dhritiman Chatterjee) and his deputy Khan (Nawazuddin Siddiqui). Khan arrives in Kolkata and reveals that Damji was a rogue IB agent responsible for the poison-gas attack. In spite of Khan's warnings, Vidya continues her search, fearing that Arnab's resemblance to Damji may have led him into trouble.|$|E

5|$|Doggett and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) {{return to}} Squamash, {{and the two}} ask the sheriff about the murder of an {{unidentified}} transient. Doggett believes that the transient was murdered by Mulder. Doggett and Skinner travel to the cemetery and discover that the grave dug up by the backhoe earlier {{is that of the}} transient. The two find the casket empty, but Doggett notices that the transient tunneled out of his own coffin. The sheriff arrives with the creature—revealed to be a soul eater, a creature that subsists off human disease—at the Hangemuhl home, where the symbol in blood is on the door again. The hideous creature opens its jaws wide and bites Hangemuhl. Doggett <b>suggests</b> <b>to</b> Skinner that Mulder shot someone to protect Hangemuhl from the man {{who was supposed to be}} in that grave. Meanwhile, deep underground, the creature vomits what appears to be the visceral remains of Marie into a person-shaped mold in the soil.|$|E
5|$|During {{a congressional}} recess in July 1878, Hayes finally sacked Arthur and Cornell (Sharpe's term had expired) and {{appointed}} replacements. When Congress reconvened, Sherman pressured his former Senate colleagues {{to confirm the}} President's replacement nominees, which they did after considerable debate. Jay and other reformers criticized Sherman the next year when he traveled to New York to speak on Cornell's behalf in his campaign for governor of New York. Sherman replied {{that it was important}} that the Republican party win the election there, despite their intra-party differences. His friendliness may also have related, as Arthur's biographer Thomas C. Reeves <b>suggests,</b> <b>to</b> a desire to keep Conkling's New York machine friendly to him as the 1880 presidential election approached.|$|E
5|$|Faulkner's Dublin Journal, a {{newspaper}} established in 1725, featured many articles written by Swift or inspired by writings of Swift. Between 1727 and 1730, Faulkner published many works attributed to Swift, but many were actually written by others. After 1730, {{only one of}} those works printed by Faulkner under Swift's name {{turned out to be}} written by someone besides Swift, which <b>suggests</b> <b>to</b> some critics that Swift was working with Faulkner to ensure that only authentic works were printed under Swift's name. He was the first to publish The Answer to the Craftsman, Swift's final defense of the Irish economy from England's policies. Faulkner was also the first to publish the collected Drapier's Letters as Fraud Detected on 2 October 1725. Faulkner also helped edit An Epistle upon an Epistle around December 1729.|$|E

Frustrated by Emma's lack of understanding, Graham later sleeps with Regina. During the night, he awakens abruptly from a dream of a deer and a wolf.

As Graham attempts to get to his car, the wolf from his visions appears next to him, startling him before it leaves. As he tries to find the wolf in the woods, he runs into Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle). Graham tells him about the wolf, and Mr. Gold <b>suggests</b> <b>to</b> him that dreams are memories from another life.|$|E
