40|$|Pumpkin (Cucurbita spp.), a crop {{native to}} America, {{represents}} a profitable {{opportunity in the}} Northeast. In the US, production of pumpkin has expanded greatly particularly in Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York. With the appreciable volume of production intended mainly for utilization of the flesh for food processing, {{it is also expected}} that significant amounts of seeds, as part of the processing wastes, are being generated. Pumpkin seeds have been reported to contain a significant amount of highly unsaturated oil. Therefore, utilization of pumpkin <b>seeds</b> for <b>oil</b> production may add value to this crop and could help reduce food-processing waste. We studied the phytochemical composition, oxidative stability and behavior of the natural antioxidants of cold-pressed pumpkin (PSO) and butternut <b>squash</b> (BSO) <b>seed</b> <b>oils.</b> Experiments included quantification of carotenoid, tocopherol and phenolic content by HPLC analyses and determination of the effect of packaging light transmission properties and storage temperatures on the oxidative stability of the oils and the retention of their major antioxidant compounds. The predominant carotenoid in BSO was -carotene (21. 8 mg/kg) while lutein+zeaxanthin (16. 76 mg/kg) was the most abundant in PSO. [alpha]-carotene and cryptoxanthin were detected at lower concentrations but the latter was not detected in BSO. The total carotenoid content of PSO (32. 4 mg/kg) was slightly lower than that of BSO (27. 1 mg/kg). Significant concentrations of tocopherols ([alpha], [gamma], and [delta]) were found with [gamma]-tocopherol showing preponderance (> 90 %) in both oils. The total tocopherol content of BSO (563 mg/kg) was not significantly different compared to that of PSO (553 mg/kg). Two isomers ([gamma] and [delta]) of tocotrienol were also detected. The individual phenolics were tyrosol, luteolin, vanillin, vanillic acid, and trans-cinnamic acid. The oils were stable for at least 20 weeks when stored in amber bottles at temperature below 300 C and we estimated a shelf-life for both oils of over 15 months based on accelerated storage test. Oxidation was most pronounced in clear bottles while green bottles provided only partial protection when exposed to 15 W fluorescent light at 200 C. The antioxidant compounds were better retained in amber bottles while significant reductions (p -tocopherol; lutein > -carotene. Phenolics exhibited only minor losses suggesting excellent stability of these compounds. Because of their high content of natural antioxidants and good storage stability, cold-pressed butternut <b>squash</b> and pumpkin <b>seed</b> <b>oils</b> demonstrate potential for valueadded uses such as production of specialty oils as natural sources of dietary antioxidants and in pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications. i...|$|R

The aim {{of the study was}} to analyze natural cold pressed oils as potential cosmetic products. Material and methods. Cold pressed oils obtained from selected seeds and fruit stones were analyzed, including: chokeberry <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> blackcurrant <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> elderberry <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> raspberry <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> apricot <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> tomato <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> strawberry <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> broccoli <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> Nigella sativa <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> hemp <b>oil,</b> safflower <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> Silybum marianum <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> and coconut oil. 80 adult volunteers assessed the cosmetic properties of the analyzed oils. Each of the volunteers tested 2 to 4 different oils, by applying them on the skin. In addition, patch tests with all analyzed oils were performed on 23 individuals. Results. The majority of tested oils were positively evaluated by the participants: in the opinion of the participants, oil extracted from safflower had the best appearance (100 % positive opinions), coconut oil had the best smell (70 % positive opinions), while black currant <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> showed the best absorbency (85 % positive opinions).

40|$|Background: Studies of the biogeographic {{distribution}} of <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content in plants are fundamental {{to understanding the}} mechanisms of adaptive evolution in plants as <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> is the primary energy source needed for germination and establishment of plants. However, <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content as an adaptive trait in plants is poorly understood. Here, we examine the adaptive nature of <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content in 168 angiosperm families occurring in different biomes across the world. We also explore the role of multiple seed traits like <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content and composition in plant adaptation in a phylogenetic and nonphylogenetic context. Result: It was observed that the <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content in tropical plants (28. 4 %) {{was significantly higher than}} the temperate plants (24. 6 %). A significant relationship between oil content and latitude was observed in three families Papaveraceae, Sapindaceae and Sapotaceae indicating that selective forces correlated with latitude influence <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content. Evaluation of the response of <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content and composition to latitude and the correlation between <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content and composition showed that multiple <b>seed</b> traits, <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content and composition contribute towards plant adaptation. Investigation of {{the presence or absence of}} phylogenetic signals across 168 angiosperm families in 62 clades revealed that members of seven clades evolved to have high or low <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content independently as they did not share a common evolutionary path. Conclusion: The study provides us an insight into the biogeographical distribution and the adaptive role of <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content in plants. The study indicates that multiple seed traits like <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> content and the fatty acid composition of the <b>seed</b> <b>oils</b> determine the fitness of the plants and validate the adaptive hypothesis that <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> quantity and quality are crucial to plant adaptation...|$|R

Growth performances, FER, serum and liver lipids, organ weights and histopathological findings of other three minor oils were satisfactory and comparable to that of peanut oil, therefore, they can be considered for edible use...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{evaluating}} the phytochemical constituents and the antimicrobial activity of the <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> of Moringa oleifera and garlic against some selected food-borne microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) using disc diffusion method. The results of the phytochemical screening revealed differences {{in the presence of}} the phytochemicals among the extracts. Saponins were detected in both Moringa oleifera and garlic <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> while alkaloid and tannins were observed in <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> of garlic. Furthermore, the antibacterial assay results shows that the <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> of Moringa oleifera was inactive against all the tested organisms, even at 100 % concentration. In contrast, garlic oil was found to be active against all the tested organisms. The highest inhibition was observed in E. coli (12 mm) at 100 % concentration, while at 20 % concentration, Salmonella Sp and P. aeruginosa showed resistance (00 mm). The antimicrobial activity of the <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> of garlic may be attributed to its phytochemicals components which were not detected in the <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> of Moringa oleifera. The results of this study have shown the potentials of the <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> of garlic as an antimicrobial agent more especially in foods, by inhibiting the growth of the test organisms, which range from food-borne pathogens to food spoilage organisms...|$|R

P. cupana <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> also contains cyanogenic type I cyanolipids, {{according to its}} 1 &# 905;-NMR spectrum. The existing controversy in the literature about the presence and/or type of cyanolipids in P. cupana <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> is {{probably due to the}} low amount of these compounds (0. 2 %) in the seeds...|$|R
40|$|Based {{on our own}} studies, {{we are in a}} {{position}} to confirm the interesting results of Struempler et al. (1) and Lehmann eta]. (2) regarding the analysis of THCCOOH in urine samples after the consumption ofhemp <b>seed</b> <b>oil.</b> In 1996, we were able to analyze tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in hemp <b>seed</b> <b>oils</b> that are available on the German market. In some cases, we found considerable amounts of THC, and our results were published (3). As part of these studies, 13 people consumed between 40 and 90 mL hemp <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> in one day. We were still able to detect THC carbonic acid, the main product of THC metabolism, in urine samples from test subjects up to 80 h later. We also analyzed blood samples after consumption of hemp <b>seed</b> <b>oil.</b> Blood samples were obtained from another six test subjects every hour after consumption of 40 mL hemp <b>seed</b> <b>oil.</b> One hour after ingestion, THC was already detected in these blood samples. Concentrations up to 6 ng THC/mL serum were obtained. Apart from hemp <b>seed</b> <b>oil,</b> we also examined a variety of other foo...|$|R
