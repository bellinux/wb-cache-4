40|$|We {{investigate}} the self-assembly of two telechelic star polymer–peptide conjugates based on poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) four-arm star polymers capped with oligotyrosine. The conjugates were prepared via N-carboxy anhydride-mediated ring-opening polymerization from PEO star polymer macroinitiators. Self-assembly occurs above a critical aggregation concentration determined via fluorescence probe assays. Peptide conformation was examined using circular dichroism spectroscopy. The structure of self-assembled aggregates was probed using small-angle X-ray scattering and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. In contrast to previous studies on linear telechelic PEO–oligotyrosine conjugates that show self-assembly into β-sheet fibrils, the <b>star</b> <b>architecture</b> suppresses fibril formation and micelles are generally observed instead, a small population of fibrils only being observed upon pH adjustment.

The resultant three-armed polymeric structures were well-defined, with polydispersity indices less than 1. 2. Upon aminolysis and further reaction with dithiodipyridine (DTDP), these three-armed polymers could be tailored with sulfhydryl and pyridyldisulfide (PDS) end functionalities, available for further reaction with any free-sulfhydryl group containing precursors to form disulfide linkages. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) confirmed {{that more than}} 98 % of the polymer arms retained integral trithiocarbonate active sites after polymerization. Intradisulfide linkages between the core and the arms conferred biodegradability on the <b>star</b> <b>architectures.</b> Subsequently, the arm-termini were attached to cholesterol also via disulfide linkages.
