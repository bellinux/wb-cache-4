5|$|Despite Pauline's pleas {{that the}} duel is a trap, Silence stands outside the saloon. A killer shoots his left hand, greatly {{impairing}} his speed and marksmanship. Loco then <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway,</b> {{ready to face}} the weakened Silence. As Silence begins reaching for his Mauser, Loco reaches for his Colt Single Action Army – but as Silence draws, another wounding shot is fired. Loco fires at Silence's head, killing him. Distraught, Pauline attempts to shoot Loco herself, but swiftly dies as well. The bounty killers turn their guns on the outlaws, massacring the entire group. As Loco and his men prepare to collect their bounties, he takes Silence's Mauser from Pauline's hands. The killers ride out of Snow Hill into the morning sun. A title card explains that Loco's actions resulted in public condemnation of bounty killing, and a memorial was erected in Snow Hill to honor those who died by his greed.|$|E

6000|$|The carriages! The Nottingham Mrs. Brangwen, in silk brocade, <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> saying {{who must}} go with whom. There {{is a great}} bustle. The front door is opened, and the wedding guests are walking down the garden path, whilst those still waiting peer through the window, and the little crowd at the gate gorps and stretches. How funny such dressed-up people look in the winter sunshine! ...|$|E

60|$|The trooper <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway,</b> {{still and}} silent. Phil has stopped {{in a low}} clinking noise, with his little hammer in his hand.

When the little hammer is next used, {{there will be a}} speck of rust upon it.|$|E
6000|$|The {{scene is}} again COKESON'S room, {{at a few}} minutes to ten of a [...] March morning, two years later. The doors are all open. [...] SWEEDLE, now blessed with a {{sprouting}} moustache, is getting the [...] offices ready.

While he is gazing his full RUTH HONEYWILL comes in [...] through the outer office and <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b> There seems [...] a kind of exultation and excitement behind her habitual [...] impassivity.|$|E
60|$|The Bishop {{comes out}} of his study. He is still a slim active man, spare of flesh, and younger by {{temperament}} than his brothers. He has a delicate skin, fine hands, a salient nose with chin to match, a short beard which accentuates his sharp chin by bristling forward, clever humorous eyes, not without a glint of mischief in them, ready bright speech, and the ways of a successful man who is always interested in himself and generally rather well pleased with himself.

The Proprietor <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> of the bar. He weighs two hundred pounds. His face is immovable as putty. He is drunk. He has been drunk for twelve years. It makes no difference to him. Behind the bar stands the Bar-tender. He wears wicker-sleeves, his hair is curled in a hook, and his name is Charlie.|$|E

"Well," [...] said Jone, [...] "if we're {{going to}} busy our minds with these people's {{shortcomings}} and long-goings, and don't try to reform them, we're just worrying ourselves and doing them no good, and I don't {{think it will}} pay. Now, for instance, there's that rosy-cheeked Hannah. She's satisfied with her way of speaking English, and Miss Pondar understands it and is satisfied with it, {{and all the people}} around here are satisfied with it. As for us, we know, when she comes and <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> and dimples up her cheeks, and then makes those sounds that are more like drops of molasses falling on a gong than anything else I know of, we know that she is telling us in her own way that the next meal, whatever it is, is ready, and we go to it." ...|$|E

50|$|She {{walks to}} {{it again and}} <b>stands</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway,</b> leaning on the side.

This stops him from touching her again and so he instead takes his anger out on Gladys until she marries Gerry and moves away. Noreen begins living with them on the condition that she finishes high school and visits home once a week.|$|E
