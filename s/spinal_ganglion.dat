40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} is to study posttraumatic survival in population of sensory (SN) and motor (MN) neurons and their size groups within 30 — 300 days after sciatic nerve transection in dynamics. Materials and Methods. There was used a method of retrograde marking by fluorescent dye Mini-Ruby for quantitative detection of survival neurons in SN and MN populations forming rat’s sciatic nerve. Research materials were <b>spinal</b> <b>ganglions</b> (SG) and <b>spinal</b> segments (SS) L 4 —L 6. Conclusion. Posttraumatic death in SN and MN populations after sciatic nerve transection is asynchronous, a sensory part, as a less stable, being a leading one since subjected to earlier degeneration. The death of SN within all periods of the experiment goes before the elimination of MN, and the stabilization of sensory-motor neuron ratio occurs only on the 150 th day. Later the imbalance in the relationship appears resulting in {{a new wave of}} degeneration among MN indicating incompleteness of a posttraumatic process by the 300 th day. As a result, in SN population only 31. 47 % of nerve cells survive, and in MN population — 40. 41 %...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Responses of {{individual}} <b>spinal</b> <b>ganglion</b> neurons, sympathetic ganglion neurons, and motoneurons of frogs to linearly rising currents were investigated utilizing microelectrodes for intraceUular stimulation and recording. <b>Spinal</b> <b>ganglion</b> neurons exhibited rapid accommodation to linearly rising currents. Minimal current gradients (MCG's) required to excite these neurons (average value, 106 rheobases/sec) {{were of the}} same order of magnitude as for some nerve fibers. Although sympathetic ganglion neurons exhibited responses to lower current gradients than <b>spinal</b> <b>ganglion</b> neurons, distinct MCG's (average value, 26 rheobases/sec) could always be established. MCG's could not be detected in most motoneurons, even with current gradients as low as 0. 6 rheobase/sec. A few motoneurons exhibited distinct MCG's (average value, 11 rheobases/sec). The failure of <b>spinal</b> <b>ganglion</b> neurons to respond to anything other than rapidly rising currents appears to be due primarily {{to the development of}} severe delayed rectification. The inability of sympathetic ganglion neurons to respond to low current gradients appears to depend not only on delayed rectification but also on increases in depolarization threshold. When present in motoneurons, accommodation appears to result from the same mechanisms responsible for its appearance in sympathetic ganglion neurons...|$|E

The <b>spinal</b> <b>ganglion</b> neuron represents a healthy neuron, and the neuroblastoma cell, which is tumorous, represents a pathological neuron. We numerically solved the non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann equation for the regions of the membrane model we have adopted, by considering the densities of charges dissolved in an electrolytic solution and fixed on both glycocalyx and cytoplasmic proteins. Our model predicts that there is a difference in the behavior of the electric potential profiles of the two types of cells, in response to changes in charge concentrations in the membrane. Our results also describe an insensitivity of the neuroblastoma cell membrane, as observed in some biological experiments. This electrical property may be responsible for the low pharmacological response of the neuroblastoma to certain chemotherapeutic treatments...|$|E

50|$|Sympathetic nerves {{arise from}} {{near the middle}} of the spinal cord in the intermediolateral nucleus of the lateral grey column, {{beginning}} at the first thoracic vertebra of the vertebral column and are thought to extend to the second or third lumbar vertebra. Because its cells begin in the thoracic and lumbar regions of the spinal cord, the sympathetic nervous system is said to have a thoracolumbar outflow. Axons of these nerves leave the spinal cord through the anterior root. They pass near the <b>spinal</b> (sensory) <b>ganglion,</b> where they enter the anterior rami of the spinal nerves. However, unlike somatic innervation, they quickly separate out through white rami connectors (so called from the shiny white sheaths of myelin around each axon) that connect to either the paravertebral (which lie near the vertebral column) or prevertebral (which lie near the aortic bifurcation) ganglia extending alongside the spinal column.|$|R

40|$|An {{histological}} {{study of}} the peripheral nervous fibres has been performed at various anatomical levels during aging: the <b>spinal</b> <b>ganglion,</b> the dorsal and the ventral nerve roots, the spinal and the sciatic nerves. During aging the various alterations occurring in a peripheral nerve can be summarized as following. In the myelinated fibres, the axoplasm was progressively invaded by several inclusions: glycogen granules, granulo-filamentous bodies and lipofuscins. The crystalloid networks arising from the cytoskeleton were mainly localised in the intraganglionic fibres. Among the axoplasmic organelles, the mitochondria were the most affected. The myelinic sheath split, became dystrophic and then was totally disrupted. The inner schwann cell compartment was invaded by several inclusions like Hirano bodies and dense residual deposits. Further, macrophages phagocytosed the axon and the myelin sheath. In the non-myelinated fibres, the alterations were less important and less precocious. When these results are analysed from a chronological point of view it is established that the alterations appear {{at the same time}} in each observed level but their amount differ from each other. In the 24 -month-old-rats, the ventral root and the sciatic nerve present many dystrophies whereas in the <b>spinal</b> <b>ganglion</b> and in the dorsal root they are less numerous. From these results, it can be suspected that the motor fibres are more vulnerable during aging. Moreover, the myelinated fibres of large diameter are the first affected. Furthermore, only the ventral root and the sciatic nerve show typical regeneration pictures at 32 months...|$|E
40|$|Peripheral {{autonomic}} and sensory neurones {{derived from}} the neural crest will survive in vitro only if the culture medium is supplemented with specific factors (for review see ref. 1). For example, the nerve growth factor (NGF), although supporting the survival of sympathetic and spinal sensory neurons, is ineffective on parasympathetic neurones, whereas medium conditioned by chick heart cells (HCM) supports the survival of all three neuronal types. We showed previously that the requirements of cultured <b>spinal</b> sensory <b>ganglion</b> neurones for survival factors changed during development, and so provided {{a basis for the}} classification of such factors. We now demonstrate that cultured post-mitotic neurones from chick paravertebral sympathetic ganglia respond differentially to NGF, HCM and medium conditioned by C 6 glioma cells (GCM). Thus, there three survival factors are functionally distinct in that they support the survival in culture of discrete subpopulations of sympathetic neurones. Those subpopulations responding to HCM and NGF are shown to differ not only in their requirements for survival factors but also in their contents of the cholinergic and adrenergic marker enzymes choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) ...|$|R

Addition of 0. 1 nM VIP to TTX-treated STD cultures for 5 d prevented the TTXmediated death and the death that occurred naturally N 'EtJRO~AL cell death is characteristic of most developing neural systems in vertebrates. The extent (30 - 80 %) of neuronal death that occurs during development indicates that the regulation {{of this process is}} of fundamental importance to the determination of nervous system structure (see Berg, 1982). Although a great deal of descriptive data has been reported concerning the magnitude and ubiquity of this neuronal cell loss, little is known of the mechanism that regulates the process during development. It is clear that electrical activity {{plays an important role in}} determining neuronal survival during this regressive phase of development. For example, blockage of electrical activity with ~t-bungarotoxin attenuates the naturally occuring cell death in spinal motorneurons (Pittman and Oppenheim, 1978) and in trochlear nucleus in vivo (Creazzo and Sohal, 1979).

40|$|Neurogenic {{inflammation}} {{is part of}} many inflammatory and atopic diseases, including those, {{which are}} affecting the skin. The inflammation is induced by activation of sensory unmyelinated neurons, which evokes the release of neuropeptides in different tissues. Substance P, the best explored neuropeptide, {{is one of the}} most important mediators of neurogenic inflammation. There exist many hypotheses about the regulation of substance P-production and –releasing during physiological and pathological processes. One of them discusses the influence of TRPV 1 on the biosynthesis of substance P. TRPV 1 (transient receptor potential vanilloid 1) is known as a receptor sensitive to vanilloid molecules including native capsaicin. The intention of this work was to investigate the impact of TRPV 1 on the expression of substance P. Therefore, in this study the animal model of atopic dermatitis on TRPV 1 -knockout mice was used. 15 animals were divided into three groups (n = 5). Two groups (n = 10) were sensitized for ovalbumin by intraperitoneal injection and were consecutively challenged by subcutan injection with ovalbumin. The third group (control group) received only a mixture without ovalbumin during sensitization and was challenged with ovalbumin as well. Afterwards, all neurons of the <b>spinal</b> <b>ganglions</b> Th 1 to Th 5, supplying directly the treated dermatom, have been investigated. By the help of immunhistochemistry all neurons and the fraction of substance P containing neurons out of 15 - 25 cuts of every ganglion have been enumerated. Additionally, all substance P-positive neurons which supply the treated dermatom have been counted and their fraction of all dermatom supplying neurons has been calculated. The identification of the neurons supplying the treated dermatom was achieved by tracing with the fluorescent dye Fluorogold. One group (n = 5) of sensitized animals was not exposed to the dye in order to exclude the influence of fluorogold on the results. The fraction of substance P- and Fluorogold-positiv neurons of all Fluorogold-positiv neurons was found to be the same for both, sensitized and non-sensitized animals. Hence, there was no significant difference (OVA: 12, 28 ± 1, 64 %; PBS: 10. 11 ± 0, 42 %; t-Test: p = 0, 24). The sensitization of TRPV 1 -knockout mice with Ovalbumin has no influence on the substance P-biosynthesis. This confirms the assumption that TRPV 1 triggers an increase of substance P-synthesis after sensitization. The mechanisms leading to this augmented substance P-production are still unknown and need further investigations. Contrarily, other regulating agents for substance P-releasing have been already investigated. Thus, only interactions of all these agents lead to an amplified or attenuated effect of substance P, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Ionotropic {{glutamate}} receptors contain three subtypes: NMDA, AMPA and kainate receptors. The former two receptor subtypes have {{well defined}} roles in nociception, while {{the role of}} kainate receptors in pain is not as well charac-terized. Kainate receptors are expressed in nociceptive pathways, including the dorsal root <b>ganglion,</b> <b>spinal</b> cord, thalamus and cortex. Electrophysiological studies show that functional kainate receptors are located postsynaptically, where they mediate a portion of excitatory synaptic transmission, or are located presynaptically, where they modulate excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmission. Recent genetic and pharmacological studies suggest that kainate receptors can regulate no-ciceptive responses.
