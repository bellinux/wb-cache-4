40|$|Most of the {{researches}} about vehicle {{ride comfort}} {{and effects of}} the car body vibration on vehicle occupant {{had little or no}} focus on the structural modal characteristics of the vehicle body while these characteristics can have large effects on the transmission of the vibration to the vehicle occupant. One of the issues of the automotive ride comfort is related to the transmission of the vibration from the rear suspension to the rear seat mounting and therefore the seat and the vehicle occupant. Since such vibration are mainly caused by the rear body structure torsion mode, more care is required to predict the characteristics of this torsion mode in early design phase of the car. When the predecessor platform is resized for using a new car, it is sometimes necessary to extend the rear overhangs of the car. This research shows that the length of rear overhang may have a large effect on the torsion mode of the body and therefore on the transmission of the vibration from the road or rear <b>suspension</b> (<b>shock</b> <b>absorbers)</b> to the rear seat mountings. When a same platform is used for two similar models with different lengths of rear overhangs, the rear seat vibration level can considerably be different for these two similar models. An automotive CAE concept beam model, here, is used to investigate the effects of rear overhang on the rear seat vibration and comfort level. CAE beam concept models for the car body are important tools are used to predict and optimize the structural dynamics, in early design phase where there is no enough detailed design data. Here, the results show that by extending the rear overhang, the dynamic stiffness of the rear/overhang bending decreases and this may considerably aggravates the transmission of the vibration to the seat...|$|E

25|$|Fully {{independent}} {{double wishbone}} suspension was employed at all four corners. Another significant change {{made from the}} P61 design was to move the <b>suspension</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> components outboard at the rear. This switch was initially made to accommodate the extra cam-cover space needed to employ the 32-valve motor, but though that unit was shelved the suspension geometry was retained. At the front, the coil spring and damper units were retained within the monocoque skin, resulting in a clean, aerodynamic profile around the car's nose-cone. Braking was by outboard-mounted, Dunlop disc brakes all round.|$|R

40|$|The use {{of modern}} control theory to produce an {{electrical}} motor simulation of a Formula 1, Grand Pnx, passive motorcycle front <b>suspension</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> is investigated. It is shown, using a test-rig comprising two permanent magnet DC motors directly coupled, that desired <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> responses to load forces can be achieved using model reference control. The controller feedback in this test rig is provided via a high resolution rotary position sensor. A stochastic Kalman filter is used to produce estimates of the load(disturbance), force and velocity from this position information. All states are then used in the controller. A mass, spring and damper model is chosen as a suitable representation of a <b>shock</b> <b>absorber,</b> and is assumed sufficiently complex to justify the control techniques used. This linear model is translated using mathematical techniques into a rotary equivalent that is compatible {{for use in the}} controller. This translation takes into account thermal effects, as well as kinematic requirements encountered by the motor on the basis of load-force data taken from the front suspension of a Formula 1 motorcycle in race conditions. The parameters of the mass spring and damper model are found from simple static tests using the <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> removed from the bike...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen a {{tremendous}} development of full-suspended mountain bikes, especially for downhill and free-ride market. These mountain bikes strongly rely {{on the ability of}} the rear <b>suspension</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> to manage extremely large forces and wheel travel. Wheel travel is generally achieved through the geometry of the suspension linkage; whereby forces are counterbalanced by the shock hydraulic and spring. The Sports Engineering Research Group (SERG) at the School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, RMIT University has investigated the dynamic characteristics of different rear linkages suspension geometry. The kinematic analysis has been performed using different programs. A customised Matlab&#x 2122; code has been developed to analyse in detail the kinematic of the linkages, a MSC. Adams&#x 2122; simulation has been conducted to better understand the kinematic and kinetic behaviour.
