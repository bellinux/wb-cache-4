5|$|At {{the time}} it was known that the drag at {{supersonic}} speeds was strongly related to the <b>span</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wing.

The team outlined a baseline configuration that looked like an enlarged Avro 730.|$|E

5|$|Construction officially {{began in}} October 2013, {{with the new}} spans being built {{to the north of}} the {{existing}} bridge. The new bridge will connect to the existing highway approaches of I-87 and I-287 on both river banks. The northbound/westbound span opened on August 25, 2017. Southbound/eastbound traffic remained on the old bridge until October 6, 2017. At that point, southbound/eastbound traffic shifted to the westbound <b>span</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new bridge and the old bridge closed. When completed in 2018, including the new eastbound span (to carry lanes currently on the westbound span), the new Tappan Zee Bridge will be one of the longest cable-stayed spans in the nation.|$|E

5|$|New Jerseys final {{contribution}} to the conquest of the Marianas was in strikes on Guam and the Palaus from which she sailed for Pearl Harbor, arriving 9 August. Here she broke the flag of Admiral William F. Halsey, Jr., 24 August, becoming flagship of the United States Third Fleet. On 30 August New Jersey set sail from Pearl Harbor, {{and for the next}} eight months was based at Ulithi to lend support to Allied forces operating in the Philippines. In this <b>span</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pacific War, fast carrier task forces ranged the waters off the Philippines, Okinawa, and Formosa, making repeated strikes at airfields, shipping, shore bases, and invasion beaches.|$|E
5|$|On November 11, 1926, the United States Numbered Highway System was {{approved}} by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO), and the original route of US12 replaced the highways from the state line northeasterly to Detroit; US31 overlapped the highway between St. Joseph and Watervliet. The remainder of the future I-94 corridor was served by US25 between Detroit and Port Huron. The first <b>span</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Blue Water Bridge opened between Port Huron and Point Edward, Ontario, in 1938.|$|E
5|$|The {{subway station}} at Porter is, at 105 feet below ground level, the deepest in the MBTA system. Porter's unusual depth {{is due to}} the MBTA's {{decision}} to build the station in bedrock rather than soft clay, saving time and money in the construction process. Passengers reach Red Line platforms via a series of escalators, stairs totalling 199 steps, or a set of elevators. The longest single <b>span</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> escalators is 143feet, the longest in the MBTA system. In 2005, a man was killed when his sweatshirt tangled {{in the bottom of the}} escalator.|$|E

5|$|A major {{accident}} {{occurred at the}} bridge in August 1931. The paddle steamer E.R.O. struck the lift <b>span</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridge. The span had not been raised to a high enough level, causing it to clip {{the top of the}} steamer's funnel and rip apart the upper deck. High pressure steam was released during the accident causing some onlookers to believe the boat was on fire. It was at first thought the captain would be found amongst the wreckage of the upper deck, but he had been navigating the boat from the lower deck at that time. The captain displayed considerable skill; he immediately realised that further raising of the span despite being given the all clear meant it was not quite high enough. And through his actions as the boat progressed downstream caught in the current, he prevented the boat becoming stuck at the bridge.|$|E
5|$|A short {{distance}} past the city line, NY5 passes over the Union Ship Canal on a <b>span</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elevated road {{known as the}} Father Baker Bridge. North of the waterway, the Skyway gains a frontage road named Fuhrmann Boulevard. Both the service road and the Skyway run parallel to Lake Erie until {{the northern end of}} the Buffalo Outer Harbor. Here, the frontage roads end while NY5 turns to the northeast, crossing the Buffalo River and entering downtown. On the north bank, the Skyway returns to a northerly routing as it passes KeyBank Center, located directly to the east, and Buffalo and Erie County Naval & Military Park, situated to the west, and meets I-190 at exit7. Past the interchange, the Skyway ends and the route descends in elevation, becoming an at-grade roadway once more at Church Street in the shadow of Buffalo City Hall. NY384 begins here, following Delaware Avenue north into the heart of downtown, while NY5 turns east onto Church.|$|E
5|$|Marylebone was reprieved {{from the}} threat of closure on 30 April 1986, and an £85million {{modernisation}} and refurbishment programme of the station and its services was granted. This was funded by selling part of the station to developers, including two of the original four platforms at the west of the station and the third <b>span</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train shed. In order to replace these, the central cab road was removed, and two new platforms numbered 2 and 3 were created in its place. The run-down lines into Marylebone were modernised with new signalling and higher line speeds. In 1991, the fleet of Class 115 trains on local services was replaced by Class 165 Turbo trains, and service frequencies were increased. Services to Banbury were extended to the reopened Birmingham Snow Hill station in 1993, creating the first long-distance service into Marylebone since 1966. Initially this service ran at two-hourly intervals, but it proved popular and was increased to an hourly frequency in 1994.|$|E
50|$|In 1999, a new {{bridge was}} built {{right next to}} the old one, {{carrying}} automobile and rail traffic on two levels. It is 3,890 m long. <b>The</b> original <b>spans</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old bridge were dismantled in the 21st century, though its supports were preserved. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spans</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old bridge was saved, restored and set on <b>the</b> banks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Amur in <b>the</b> Museum <b>of</b> Khabarovsk Bridge, which is located nearby.

5|$|On 27 March, the {{division}} sortied {{with the rest}} of the fleet for a major sweep toward the island of Crete. During the operation, Trieste flew the flag of Rear Admiral Luigi Sansonetti. At 06:55 on the 28th, an IMAM Ro.43 floatplane launched by Vittorio Veneto located a British cruiser squadron, and by 07:55, Trento and the 3rd Division had come within visual range. Seventeen minutes later, the Italian cruisers opened fire from a range of , initiating the first phase of the Battle of Cape Matapan; in the <b>span</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> next forty minutes, Trieste fired a total of 132armor-piercing shells, though trouble with her rangefinders and the extreme range of the action prevented her from scoring any significant hits.|$|E
5|$|On November 11, 1926, the United States Numbered Highway System was {{approved}} by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO), and the new US27 replaced M-29 from the state line northward to Lansing. By the end of the next year, M-78 was extended from Charlotte north and east of Lansing to a junction with M-47 near Pittsburg, north of the modern I-69. The section of M-78 north of Lansing was changed in 1929; the segment from Dewitt to Pittsburg was redesignated M-104, and M-78 was rerouted along a more southerly path through East Lansing to Haslett. By 1936, M-78 was extended from Haslett all the way into Flint to end at M-21. The first <b>span</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Blue Water Bridge opened between Port Huron and Point Edward, Ontario, in 1938.|$|E
5|$|SSH9E was {{extended}} southeast to the South Point ferry over Hood Canal in 1947, as the ferry traveled east to {{a branch of}} PSH21 at Lofall created in 1949. The highway was moved south from Discovery Bay to intersect US101 near Crocker Lake in 1957 and {{was extended}} across the floating Hood Canal Bridge in 1959 to PSH21 west of Port Gamble prior to the bridge opening on August 12, 1961. SR104 was designated over the highways in 1964 and {{was signed into law}} in 1970. The Hood Canal Bridge, officially named after William A. Bugge, sank during the February 13, 1979 windstorm and was replaced by a ferry operating between Lofall and South Point until the west span was re-opened on October 23, 1982. The east <b>span</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridge was replaced between 1997 and 2010, closing the bridge to traffic in May 2009 and re-opening the South PointLofall ferry. The route of the highway has not been revised significantly since the 1994 inclusion of ferry routes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} railings to {{the east}} and west sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridge <b>spans</b> were tubular top and bottom rails supported to steel angle standards with crimped wire mesh infill panels.
