Many Stirling cycle heat engines can be run backwards {{to act as a}} refrigerator, and therefore these engines have a niche use in cryogenics. In addition there are other types of cryocoolers such as Gifford-McMahon coolers, Joule-Thomson coolers, pulse-tube refrigerators and, for temperatures between 2 mK and 500 mK, dilution refrigerators.|$|E

50|$|The bucket belt {{was driven}} by another small steam engine mounted {{on the left side}} of the firebox, near the top. The main shaft of this engine had {{adjustable}} cams which operated three steam cocks that supplied <b>steam</b> <b>jets</b> to the coal delivery orifices. From the central receiver, a cone-shaped tray directed the coal to the right, centre or left sides as required, while the cam-operated <b>steam</b> <b>jets</b> blew the coal into the firebox. When coal was only required at the back end of the firebox, the cams could be projected a short distance, thereby allowing <b>steam</b> <b>jets</b> of just sufficient power to project the coal to the required parts of the firebox.|$|R

2500|$|Articles {{about the}} CPRR {{appeared}} in several magazines, including Look magazine in September 1951. These articles attracted visitors interested in riding Disney's miniature steam train and on weekends, when the railroad was operating, he {{allowed them to}} do so, even allowing some to become [...] "guest engineers" [...] and drive the train. With a tractive effort of more than , the Lilly Belle could pull a train with up to 12 adult passengers. Due to its lack of brakes, the locomotive was sent in reverse if it ever needed to stop quickly. In early 1953, a visitor drove the Lilly Belle too fast along a curve, making it derail. The derailment caused the Lilly Belle to fall on its side, break its whistle, and release a jet of steam across the ground. A curious five-year-old girl ran through the <b>steam</b> <b>jet,</b> which left minor burns on her legs. As {{a result of this}} incident, Walt Disney, fearing the possibility of future accidents, closed down the Carolwood Pacific Railroad and placed the locomotive in storage.|$|E
2500|$|The Alexander Chaplin & Co. distilling {{apparatus}} {{was designed}} initially {{for use on}} board steam vessels where it could be supplied with steam from either the main boiler or a donkey boiler with cooling water circulation from a pump driven from the main engine or an auxiliary. The subsequent addition of a steam powered circulating pump integral with the apparatus meant it could then {{also be used as}} a standalone apparatus on any vessel equipped with an existing donkey (auxiliary) boiler, such as a sailing ship equipped with steam winches. The apparatus consisted of a coiled condensing pipe approximately [...] in length placed inside a cylindrical casing filled with constantly changed cooling water. The casing was cast iron and the coils were made of copper. The coils were supplied with steam either from the exhaust of the engine, or from a feed directly from the boiler. A circulating pump, either driven from the main engine on a steam ship, or integrated with the apparatus on a sailing ship, supplied a constant stream of cooling water flowing through the condenser. A covered brass cup with small adjustable holes around the circumference was fitted at {{the upper end of the}} steam coil. In operation, a <b>steam</b> <b>jet</b> drew air in from the circumferential openings in the cup and filled the coils with a mixture of air and steam, both cooling the steam and reducing its pressure. As it passed down the coil, the air/steam mixture was further cooled by the surrounding water, and condensed as water droplets on the walls of the coil. The aerated water would collect as a clear, bright and odourless liquid at a temperature of about [...] at the bottom of the coil, to be drawn off for use. The machine could supply approximately [...] of water per hour. [...] "The samples of water subjected to analysis were collected at different times directly from the Patent Apparatus on board ship... and the results of my experiments with the water distilled in Alexander Chaplin & Co.'s are conclusive in showing that is of excellent quality in every particular." ...|$|E

60|$|Once, only, {{he dreamed}} to advantage. Famishing, shipwrecked or marooned, he {{fought with the}} big Pacific surf for rock-clinging mussels, and carried them up the sands to the dry flotsam of the spring tides. Of this he built a fire, and among the coals he laid his {{precious}} trove. He watched the <b>steam</b> <b>jet</b> forth and the locked shells pop apart, exposing the salmon-colored meat. Cooked to a turn--he knew it; and {{this time there was}} no intruding presence to whisk the meal away. At last--so he dreamed within the dream--the dream would come true. This time he would eat. Yet in his certitude he doubted, and he was steeled for the inevitable shift of vision until the salmon-colored meat, hot and savory, was in his mouth. His teeth closed upon it. He ate! The miracle had happened! The shock aroused him. He awoke in the dark, lying on his back, and heard himself mumbling little piggish squeals and grunts of joy. His jaws were moving, and between his teeth meat was crunching. He did not move, and soon small fingers felt about his lips, and between them was inserted a tiny sliver of meat. And in that he would eat no more, rather than that he was angry, Labiskwee cried and in his arms sobbed herself to sleep. But he lay on awake, marveling at the love and the wonder of woman.|$|E
60|$|How long he {{sat there}} he did not know, until, suddenly, across his sightless vision he saw form a long {{horizontal}} line of white. It was curious. But as he watched it grow in definiteness he {{saw that it was}} a coral reef smoking in the white Pacific surges. Next, in the line of breakers he made out a small canoe, an outrigger canoe. In the stern he saw a young bronzed god in scarlet hip-cloth dipping a flashing paddle. He recognized him. He was Moti, the youngest son of Tati, the chief, and this was Tahiti, and beyond that smoking reef lay the sweet land of Papara and the chief's grass house by the river's mouth. It {{was the end of the}} day, and Moti was coming home from the fishing. He was waiting for the rush of a big breaker whereon to jump the reef. Then he saw himself, sitting forward in the canoe as he had often sat in the past, dipping a paddle that waited Moti's word to dig in like mad when the turquoise wall of the great breaker rose behind them. Next, he was no longer an onlooker but was himself in the canoe, Moti was crying out, they were both thrusting hard with their paddles, racing on the steep face of the flying turquoise. Under the bow the water was hissing as from a <b>steam</b> <b>jet,</b> the air was filled with driven spray, there was a rush and rumble and long-echoing roar, and the canoe floated on the placid water of the lagoon. Moti laughed and shook the salt water from his eyes, and together they paddled in to the pounded-coral beach where Tati's grass walls through the cocoanut-palms showed golden in the setting sun.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{mechanical}} induced draught. The first is through use of a <b>steam</b> <b>jet.</b> The <b>steam</b> <b>jet</b> oriented in the direction of flue gas flow induces flue gases into the stack and allows for a greater flue gas velocity increasing the overall draught in the furnace. This method was common on steam driven locomotives which could not have tall chimneys. The second method is by simply using an induced draught fan (ID fan) which removes flue gases from the furnace and forces the exhaust gas up the stack. Almost all induced draught furnaces operate with a slightly negative pressure.|$|E
