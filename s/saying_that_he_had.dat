5|$|While in the USSR, Willkie {{urged the}} opening of a second front against the Germans; when reporters asked Roosevelt about those comments, the {{president}} responded flippantly by <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> read the headlines but had not considered the speculative comments worth the reading. This angered Willkie, and on his return from his 49-day trip, he confronted Roosevelt about it when making his report at the White House.|$|E
5|$|Another Canadian {{admirer of}} the painted turtle is Jon Montgomery, {{who won the}} 2010 Olympic gold medal in {{skeleton}} (a form of sled) racing, while wearing a painted turtle painting on the crown of his helmet, prominently visible when he slid downhill. Montgomery, who also iconically tattoed his chest with a maple-leaf, explained his visual promotion of the turtle, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> assisted one to cross the road. BC Hydro referred to Montgomery's action when describing its own sponsorship of conservation research for the turtle in British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Kasab's {{trial began}} on 6 May 2009. He {{initially}} pleaded not guilty, but later admitted his guilt on 20 July 2009. He initially apologised {{for the attacks}} and claimed that he deserved {{the death penalty for}} his crimes, but later retracted these claims, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been tortured by police to force his confession, and that he had been arrested while roaming the beach. The court had accepted his plea, but {{due to the lack of}} completeness within his admittance, the judge had deemed that many of the 86 charges were not addressed and therefore the trial continued.|$|E

5|$|When Lowe {{arrived at}} Singapore Changi Airport {{on the morning}} of 8 March, he was accosted by Martin (under the assumed name of Simon Davis), who struck up a {{conversation}} with him and suggested that they share a room, to which Lowe agreed. They managed to book Room 1511 in the River View Hotel off Havelock Road. The next morning, Martin asked a hotel receptionist to delete Lowe's name from the room registration system, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> kicked Lowe out the previous night for being a homosexual. Martin checked out on 11 March and flew to Bangkok the same day.|$|E
5|$|Basta's {{soldiers}} accompanied Sigismund to Tokaj. Before long, {{he went to}} Prague to beg for RudolphII's mercy. He {{received the}} incolatus (or the right to own lands in Bohemia) in 1604. After the Diet of Transylvania proclaimed Stephen Bocskai prince in February 1605, Rudolph tried to persuade Sigismund to return to Transylvania, {{but he did not}} accept the offer. The ambassadors of Venice and Spain and the emperor again tried to convince him to lay claim to Transylvania in July 1606, but Sigismund refused, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> no information about the affairs of his former principality. In December he again met Rudolph in Prague, but still resisted the emperor's offer.|$|E
5|$|Historian Martin Samuels has {{questioned}} {{whether it was}} in fact Varro in command on the day on the grounds that Paullus may have been in command on the right. The warm reception that Varro received after the battle from the Senate was in striking contrast to the savage criticism meted out to other commanders. Samuels doubts whether Varro would have been received with such warmth had he been in command. Gregory Daly notes that, in the Roman military, the right was always the place of command. He suggests that at the Battle of Zama Hannibal was quoted <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> fought Paullus at Cannae and concludes {{that it is impossible to}} be sure who was in command on the day.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, Australian {{researcher}} Jean Williams {{claimed that}} cancer {{rates in the}} town of Innisfail, Queensland were 10 times higher than the state average due to secret testing of Agent Orange by the Australian military scientists during the Vietnam War. Williams, who had won the Order of Australia medal for her research on the effects of chemicals on U.S. war veterans, based her allegations on Australian government reports found in the Australian War Memorial's archives. A former soldier, Ted Bosworth, backed up the claims, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been involved in the secret testing. Neither Williams or Bosworth have produced verifiable evidence to support their claims. The Queensland health department determined that cancer rates in Innisfail were no higher than those {{in other parts of the}} state.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} that General Nguyễn Khánh — who had deposed Minh in a January 1964 coup — offered Cẩn exile if he handed over his foreign bank deposits. Cẩn protested, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> no money. Đôn later claimed that Khánh would have executed Cẩn anyway, as Cẩn would have known of the corruption that the generals were party to. During the Ngô era, Khánh commanded the ARVN II Corps, which had operated in the Central Highlands under Cẩn's supervision. Despite having helped to arrest Cẩn, Lodge advised Khánh to be restrained in {{his handling of the}} case for fear of stoking religious resentment or upsetting international opinion with a death penalty.|$|E
5|$|Prior to his arrest, Chandler {{worked as}} an {{unlicensed}} aluminum-siding contractor. He testified in his own defense, {{against the advice of}} his attorneys, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> met the Ohio women and had given them directions, but that he never saw them again aside from in newspaper coverage and on the billboards set up by authorities. Police originally theorized that two men were involved in the murders, but this was discounted once Chandler was arrested. Following his conviction, Chandler was incarcerated at Union Correctional Institution, and, during his seventeen years of incarceration until his execution, he was notable for not having had a single visitor.|$|E

5|$|The Shooting Star shared plot {{similarities}} with The Chase of the Golden Meteor, a 1908 {{novel by}} pioneering French science-fiction writer Jules Verne. As in Hergé's story, Verne's novel features {{an expedition to}} the North Atlantic to find a meteorite fragment containing a new element. In both stories, the competing expedition teams were led by an eccentric professor and a Jewish banker, and Verne's novel had a Doktor Schultze to Hergé's Professor Schulze—both from the University of Jena. Hergé denied deliberately copying Verne's story, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> only read one of the French novelist's works; {{it is possible that}} the influence from Verne came via Jacques Van Melkebeke, Hergé's friend and assistant, who was a fan of the genre. The Swedish expedition member Eric Björgenskjöld physically resembles a real person: Auguste Piccard, who later became Hergé's inspiration for Professor Calculus.|$|E
5|$|A February 2000 {{story about}} organic {{vegetables}} on 20/20 included statements by Stossel that tests {{had shown that}} neither organic nor conventional produce samples contained any pesticide residue, and that organic food {{was more likely to}} be contaminated by E. coli bacteria. The Environmental Working Group objected to his report, mainly questioning his statements about bacteria, but also managed to determine that the produce had never been tested for pesticides. They communicated this to Stossel, but after the story's producer backed Stossel's statement that the test results had been as described, the story was rebroadcast months later, unchanged, and with a postscript in which Stossel reiterated his claim. Later, after a report in The New York Times confirmed the Environmental Working Group's claims, ABC News suspended the producer of the segment for a month and reprimanded Stossel. Stossel apologized, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> thought the tests had been conducted as reported. However, he asserted that the gist of his report had been accurate.|$|E
5|$|At {{an unknown}} date, {{which may have}} been in the early 640s, East Anglia was {{attacked}} by a Mercian army and Ecgric was obliged to defend it with a much smaller force, though one that was not negligible. The East Angles appealed to Sigeberht to leave his monastery and lead them in battle, hoping that his presence and the memory of his former military exploits would encourage the army and make them less likely to flee. Sigeberht refused, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> renounced his worldly kingdom and now lived only for the heavenly kingdom. However, he was dragged from the monastery to the battlefield where, unwilling to bear arms, he went into battle carrying only a staff. The Mercians were victorious and Sigeberht, Ecgric and many of the East Angles were slain and their army was routed. In this way Sigeberht became a Christian martyr. He is among the names of the kings who according to an ancient saying, were avenged by the slaying of Penda in 654.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, Hastert {{announced}} he would support an Armenian Genocide resolution. Analysts noted {{that at the time}} there was a tight congressional race in California, in which the large Armenian community might be important in favor of the Republican incumbent. The resolution, vehemently opposed by Turkey, had passed the Human Rights Subcommittee of the House and the International Relations Committee but Hastert, although first supporting it, withdrew the resolution {{on the eve of the}} full House vote. He explained this by <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> received a letter from Bill Clinton asking him to withdraw it, because it would harm U.S. interests. Even though there is no evidence that a payment was made, an official at the Turkish Consulate is said to have claimed in one recording, that was translated by Sibel Edmonds, that the price for Hastert to withdraw the Armenian Genocide resolution would have been at least $500,000.|$|E
5|$|On May 23, 1994, Mexican State Judicial Police arrested Olivarez {{again in}} Matamoros for {{possessing}} two stolen vehicles. He {{was interviewed by}} Mexican authorities and stated {{that he was not}} guilty of Fischer's murder. He admitted to having stolen cars since he was young, and stated that Garza was trying to put the blame on him to protect himself from prosecution. Olivarez justified himself by <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> never been arrested with a gun. He admitted going to Dallas in 1992, but stated that he only knew Garza by name. He said he was a self-employed auto mechanic who supported his wife, mother, and uncle. Mexican officials said that Olivarez's auto theft ring extended all the way to Monterrey, as well as in Río Bravo, Valle Hermoso, and Matamoros, Tamaulipas. There was an arrest warrant for him issued by a state judge in Reynosa for being connected to about 50 car thefts. Brownsville investigators went to Mexico {{to see if they could}} talk to Olivarez, and began extradition procedings to bring him to a Texan court.|$|E
5|$|Temple {{returned}} to Parliament with {{the recall of}} the Rump and Long Parliaments by General Monck, but following the Restoration in 1660, he was excluded from the Indemnity and Oblivion Act, because of {{his role in the}} trial and execution of Charles I. He was captured in Warwickshire while trying to travel to Ireland, under his first wife's maiden name of Busbridge. He was held in the Tower of London before being tried as a regicide. He tried to avoid the death penalty by <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> only acted as a judge in Charles I's trial in order to give information to the Royalists. He went on to claim that he had tried to prevent the King's execution, begging Oliver Cromwell to spare him. He did avoid execution and was sentenced to life imprisonment. As a result of security concerns, a number of regicides, including Temple were sent to Jersey in the Channel Islands. Initially he was imprisoned in Mont Orgueil, and subsequently in Elizabeth Castle, where he is reported to have died on 17 February 1680.|$|E

5|$|The strict {{qualifications}} {{required of}} presidential candidates resulted in walkovers during {{the elections of}} 1999, 2005 and 2017. The incumbent President Ong Teng Cheong did not run {{for a second term}} at the 1999 presidential election, <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> no compelling reason to do so. In addition to the eventual winner, Sellapan Ramanathan (better known as S. R. Nathan), the other potential candidates were Tan Soo Phuan, a member of the opposition Workers' Party of Singapore; and Ooi Boon Ewe, a private tutor turned real estate executive. Both of them were found not to have met the criteria to stand for election. As a result, Nathan, a former civil servant and Ambassador to the United States, was deemed to have been elected President. At the presidential election of 2005, the persons who applied for a certificate of eligibility to contest the election were Nathan, Ooi and Ramachandran Govindasamy Naidu. However, as Nathan was again the only candidate issued with a certificate, he was elected by default on nomination day.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Liz drinks {{poisoned}} punch which Julian's ex-wife Rebecca Hotchkiss {{had intended}} for Eve. Liz accuses Eve of deliberately {{giving her the}} punch, and Eve is arrested for attempted murder. T. C. proposes to Liz, but she becomes increasingly paranoid over his romantic feelings for Eve. Liz attempts to force Julian {{to have sex with}} her {{in the middle of an}} earthquake and tsunami, and stabs him in the back when he does not comply. At this point, Liz lies to Julian by <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> raped her in the past. T. C. later breaks off his engagement with Liz after reconciling with his ex-wife's past and rebukes all of her efforts to seduce her way back into his life. On the eve of Eve's trial, Liz offers her adoptive sister a deal: she will rescind her accusation and not testify if Eve promises to leave Harmony forever. Eve considers the deal before ultimately refusing it. Near the end of Eve's trial, Julian agrees to give Rebecca anything she wants in exchange for her testimony that she saw Liz with the vial of poison. Tabitha Lenox's daughter Endora Lenox magically casts the jury into a fake flashback, matching Rebecca's testimony, and the judge declares a mistrial.|$|E
5|$|However, Nansouty's move {{compromised}} Lannes's entire plan, which {{counted on}} powerful reinforcements arriving through Heinrichsdorf. An alarmed Lannes immediately sent {{one of his}} aides de camp to Grouchy urging him to stop the enemy from cutting his communications with the Emperor, whatever the cost. Grouchy duly took command of Nansouty's leading squadrons, ordering {{them back to their}} initial position, then launched a desperate but successful charge with his own dragoons, arriving in the streets of the village and cutting off its Russian defenders. Grouchy's dragoons became disorganised and were badly positioned following this sudden charge, and the Russian cavalry countercharged them, but Nansouty arrived just in time and the French repulsed the Russian cavalry, momentarily securing the position. A lively argument ensued between the two cavalry commanders. Grouchy invoked his seniority and position as commander of the cavalry and criticised Nansouty's earlier decision to withdraw. Nansouty countered by <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> superior experience at handling cavalry. When combat resumed, the quarrel did not prevent Nansouty from performing brilliantly under Grouchy's command during the dramatic series of events that followed. Having been repulsed earlier, the Russians decided to force the position at Heinrichsdorf, and they assembled a strong infantry force preceded by no less than 60 cavalry squadrons, plus around 2,000 Cossacks. To counter this move, Grouchy opted for deception, luring some of the enemy cavalry away from the infantry. Then, Grouchy charged the enemy horse from the front; simultaneously Nansouty hit them from the flank and together Grouchy and Nansouty repulsed them. Despite numerous charges and countercharges, the French cavalry maintained the upper hand.|$|E
