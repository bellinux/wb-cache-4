Ramayana mentions that Sugriva indulges in sexual pleasures of women, including Ruma and Tara, who he coveted. In Ramayana however, Angada criticizes Sugriva for his lustful marriage to his elder sister-in-law Tara, who is like a mother to him. Though a political marriage, Tara serves Sugriva loyally.|$|E

Appraisal theory suggests the following twofold relationship between <b>social</b> <b>norms</b> and emotions: First, <b>social</b> <b>norms</b> {{play an important role}} in the generation of emotions; second, emotion regulation depends heavily on the influence of <b>social</b> <b>norms.</b> Based on these insights, we present an emotion-based view on the influential study by Conte and Castelfranchi (1995); without mentioning emotions, they argue that a function of <b>social</b> <b>norms</b> is aggression control.

25|$|Social norms {{can also}} be {{observed}} everywhere people interact, not only in physical spaces but in virtual communities on the Internet. Lawrence Lessig describes how social norms can regulate behavior in cyberspace: through an individual's perceptions from the (physical or virtual) surrounding community. For example, if a disabled person boards a crowded bus, everyone expects that some able-bodied person will volunteer their seat. The same <b>social</b> <b>norm,</b> although executed in a different environment, {{can also be}} applied to the Internet. If a user enters a discussion in a chat room and continues to use all capital letters or to make personal attacks ("flames") when addressing other users, the culprit may realize he or she has been blocked by other participants. As in real life, users learning to adapt to the social norms of cyberspace communities provide a public good—here, not suffering disruptive online behavior—for all the participants.|$|E

At the same time, Newlywed lost the sponsorships of Ford and Procter & Gamble and earned the resentment of Jackie Autry, whose husband and business partner Gene Autry owned the show's Los Angeles outlet and production base, KTLA, because of its supposedly highly prurient content. So strong were the feelings of the Autrys that Newlywed came close to being expelled from the KTLA facilities, but the show was discontinued by the syndicator before any action occurred. Gong Show and Dating Game also ended otherwise successful syndicated runs in 1980 because of the Three's a Crowd and Newlywed controversies, likely because stations were fearful of community and advertiser retribution on account of Barris' reputation.|$|E

2500|$|To {{test the}} concept of [...] "noticing," [...] Latane and Darley (1968) staged an {{emergency}} using Columbia University students. The students were placed in a room—either alone, with two strangers or with three strangers to complete a questionnaire while {{they waited for the}} experimenter to return. While they were completing the questionnaire smoke was pumped into the room through a wall vent to simulate an emergency. When students were working alone they noticed the smoke almost immediately (within 5 seconds). However, students that were working in groups took longer (up to 20 seconds) to notice the smoke. Latané and Darley claimed this phenomenon could be explained by the <b>social</b> <b>norm</b> of what is considered polite etiquette in public. In most western cultures, politeness dictates that it is inappropriate to idly look around. This may indicate that a person is nosy or rude.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Social</b> <b>norms</b> are {{theoretically}} {{hypothesized to}} influence health-related {{behaviors such as}} physical activity and eating behaviors. However, empirical evidence relating <b>social</b> <b>norms</b> to these behaviors, independently of other more commonly-investigated social constructs such as social support, is scarce and findings equivocal, perhaps due to limitations in {{the ways in which}} <b>social</b> <b>norms</b> have been conceptualized and assessed. This study investigated associations between clearly-defined <b>social</b> <b>norms</b> and a range of physical activity and eating behaviors amongst women, adjusting for the effects of social support. Methods Self-report survey data about particular physical activity (leisure-time moderate-vigorous activity; volitional walking; cycling for transport) and eating behaviors (fast food, soft drink and fruit and vegetable consumption), and <b>social</b> <b>norms</b> and support for these, were provided by 3, 610 women aged 18 - 46 years living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods in Victoria, Australia. Results Results of regression analyses showed that <b>social</b> <b>norms</b> for physical activity and eating behaviors predicted these respective behaviors relatively consistently; these associations generally remained significant after adjustment for social support. Conclusions Acknowledging the cross-sectional study design, these data confirm theoretical accounts of the importance of <b>social</b> <b>norms</b> for physical activity and eating behaviors, and suggest that this is independent from social support. Intervention strategies aimed at promoting physical activity and healthy eating could incorporate strategies aimed at modifying <b>social</b> <b>norms</b> relating to these behaviors. </p...|$|R
