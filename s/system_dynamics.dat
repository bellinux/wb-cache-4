As mentioned above, the effectiveness of rider lean varies inversely with {{the mass of the}} bike. On heavy bikes, such as motorcycles, rider lean mostly alters the ground clearance requirements in a turn, improves the view of the road, and improves the bike <b>system</b> <b>dynamics</b> in a very low-frequency passive manner. In motorcycle racing, leaning the torso, moving the body, and projecting a knee {{to the inside of the}} turn relative to the bike can also cause an aerodynamic yawing moment that facilitates entering and rounding the turn.|$|E

Both models approximately fit the data and it is shown {{that in this case}} the two approaches can be used to complement each other.

The agent-based model provides greater explanatory power, which can in turn be used to fine tune the <b>systems</b> <b>dynamics</b> model.

25|$|Use {{of methods}} that allow early {{detection}} of possible failures, in safety engineering, are integrated into the design process. At the same time, decisions made {{at the beginning of}} a project whose consequences are not clearly understood can have enormous implications later in the life of a system, and it is the task of the modern systems engineer to explore these issues and make critical decisions. No method guarantees today's decisions will still be valid when a system goes into service years or decades after first conceived. However, there are techniques that support the process of systems engineering. Examples include soft systems methodology, Jay Wright Forrester's <b>System</b> <b>dynamics</b> method, and the Unified Modeling Language (UML)—all currently being explored, evaluated, and developed to support the engineering decision process.|$|E
25|$|Once the {{requirements}} are understood, {{it is now}} the responsibility of a systems engineer to refine them, and to determine, along with other engineers, the best technology for a job. At this point starting with a trade study, systems engineering encourages the use of weighted choices to determine the best option. A decision matrix, or Pugh method, is one way (QFD is another) to make this choice while considering all criteria that are important. The trade study in turn informs the design, which again affects graphic representations of the system (without changing {{the requirements}}). In an SE process, this stage represents the iterative step that is carried out until a feasible solution is found. A decision matrix is often populated using techniques such as statistical analysis, reliability analysis, <b>system</b> <b>dynamics</b> (feedback control), and optimization methods.|$|E
25|$|Cancer is {{the result}} of somatic {{mutations}} which provide cancer cells with a selective growth advantage. Recently it has been very important to determine the novel mutations. Genomics and proteomics techniques are used worldwide to identify mutations related to each specific cancer and their treatments. Computational tools are used to predict growth and surface antigens on cancerous cells. There are publications explaining a targeted approach for assessing mutations and cancer risk. Algorithm CanPredict was used to indicate how closely a specific gene resembles known cancer-causing genes. Cancer immunology has been given so much importance that the data related to it is growing rapidly. Protein–protein interaction networks provide valuable information on tumorigenesis in humans. Cancer proteins exhibit a network topology that is different from normal proteins in the human interactome. Immunoinformatics have been useful in increasing success of tumour vaccination. Recently, pioneering works have been conducted to analyse the host immune <b>system</b> <b>dynamics</b> in response to artificial immunity induced by vaccination strategies..

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that much of recent terror is ethnically based, little {{attention}} has been paid to systematically explaining ethnic violence. We built on the work done by the Minorities at Risk Project (MAR) to the issue of ethnic terror using <b>systems</b> <b>dynamics.</b> While there has been important work done using MAR to explore ethnic violence as a base using statistics and qualitative analysis (Gurr 2000), there has been little work exploring ethnic terrorism specifically and none that has exploited <b>systems</b> <b>dynamics</b> as an analytical tool. The application of a <b>systems</b> <b>dynamics</b> approach is expected to help us go beyond some of the limitations of statistical analysis to explore how government policy and ethnonationalist terrorism feed of each other in a cycle of violence, discrimination and repression. This work has three broad goals. First, it is targeted at understanding the causes of ethnic terror and second examining the way the relation between the ethnic policies of governments and the behavior of ethnic groups-particularly their choice to use or not use terrorism relate systematically. Third, this work sees to apply for the first time the tools of <b>systems</b> <b>dynamics</b> to political violence...|$|R
