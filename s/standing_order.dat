5|$|Captain Renaudin {{was said}} in a naval {{registry}} to have swum to safety. He had in fact abandoned his ship with the first British boat, leaving his men behind in disregard for military customs and the 1765 <b>standing</b> <b>order</b> that Captains had to be last to abandon ship, and though his account insinuates {{that he was on}} a boat close to Vengeur when she foundered, he was actually dining in the mess of Culloden at the moment of the sinking. In 1795, Loutherbourg depicted the rescue of Vengeurs crew by British ships in his large canvas of the battle, Lord Howe's action, or the Glorious First of June.|$|E
5|$|Established by <b>Standing</b> <b>Order</b> 18 of the Senate, the {{privileges}} committee {{is responsible for}} reporting on matters of parliamentary privilege referred to it by the Senate. The protections afforded by parliamentary privilege are essential to parliament and its committees {{to be able to}} operate effectively. The bulk of the work of {{the privileges}} committee's work is associated with facilitating a 'right of reply' for people adversely named in the Senate, as well as involving investigations of unauthorised disclosures of Senate committee proceedings, complaints from witnesses in connection with evidence given to committees, and allegedly misleading evidence given to committees.|$|E
40|$|<b>Standing</b> <b>orders</b> are {{remnants}} {{of an early}} period of library acquisition, and while they can provide a useful service in limited cases most have outlived that usefulness and should be cancelled.

50|$|The <b>Standing</b> <b>Orders</b> Committee is {{a select}} {{committee}} of the House of Lords that deals with private bills. When the Examiner of Private Bills determines that the promoters of a private bill have not complied with the <b>Standing</b> <b>Orders</b> of the House of Lords relating to Private Business, the matter is referred to the Committee, who advise the House whether to waive the applicable <b>standing</b> <b>orders.</b> If the Examiner is in doubt {{as to whether the}} <b>Standing</b> <b>Orders</b> have been complied with, he may refer the matter to the Committee, who then decide the matter on their own authority. In the case of an unopposed private bill, the Chairman of Committees may act alone on behalf of the Committee.|$|R
50|$|This Act {{requires}} {{employers in}} industrial establishments {{to define and}} post the conditions of employment by issuing so-called <b>standing</b> <b>orders.</b> These <b>standing</b> <b>orders</b> {{must be approved by}} the government and duly certified. These orders aim to remove flexibility from the employer in terms of job, hours, timing, leave grant, productivity measures and other matters. The <b>standing</b> <b>orders</b> mandate that the employer classify its employees, state the shifts, payment of wages, rules for vacation, rules for sick leave, holidays, rules for termination amongst others.|$|R
5|$|This river {{valve system}} {{was one of}} the first parts of the dam to be built when the dam project started in 1961, because its initial purpose was to divert the river while the dam was under construction. After that, it served various purposes, {{including}} as a possible emergency release valve. Since the accident, DWR had implemented a <b>standing</b> <b>order</b> that prohibited the operation of the river outlet system and significantly limited access to the river valve chamber. Following the accident, DWR entered into a 2012 Agreement with CalOSHA to hire a third party expert to improve the safety of the River Valve Outlet System (RVOS) and make it operational again. In 2014, DWR embarked on an accelerated refurbishment program to respond to concerns about operational needs during the ongoing drought. The system was mostly refurbished and was used during 2014 and 2015 to meet Endangered Species Act temperature requirements for the Feather River. Some additional refurbishments were being made to portions of the RVOS and were expected to conclude in early 2017.|$|E
5|$|Tronstad, {{holding a}} {{military}} rank, had a <b>standing</b> <b>order</b> {{to report to}} the Norwegian military headquarters in Oslo {{in the face of a}} military peril. When Germany invaded Norway on 9 April 1940, he first informed his students of the situation, and then drove towards Oslo. He brought his wife and children with him, but having no intention of taking them to a possible theatre of war, he left them in the Drivdalen valley. He continued alone but shortly after, upon learning that Oslo was the first city to fall to the invaders, he stopped at Dovre. The family had a cabin in the vicinity. Here, he helped organize volunteers from local rifle associations to form a line of defence meant to repel any advancing German forces. German Fallschirmjäger paratroops did land at nearby Dombås, but were surprised by a contingent of regular Norwegian forces already in the area, who ensured a tactical victory for Norway in the ensuing Battle of Dombås.|$|E

25|$|After the 2008 Mumbai attacks, PAF {{was put on}} high alert. It {{deployed}} to all its wartime locations and started combat air patrols. The speed and intensity of the deployment and PAF's readiness took the Indian Army High Command by surprise and later reports suggest was the main factor in the Indian decision of not going for cross border raids inside Pakistan. PAF was issued a <b>Standing</b> <b>Order</b> to launch an immediate counter-attack {{in case of an}} air attack from India, after a call from the Indian Foreign Minister Pranab Mukherjee to the Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari (the call later {{turned out to be a}} hoax).|$|E
25|$|The changes {{removed the}} 60-vote {{requirement}} to begin debate on legislation, {{and allowed the}} minority two amendments to measures that reached the Senate floor. This change was implemented as a <b>standing</b> <b>order</b> that expired {{at the end of}} the term in which it was passed. The new rules also reduced the amount of time allowed for debate after a motion to proceed from 30 hours to four hours. Additionally, they stated that a filibuster on a motion to proceed could be blocked with a petition signed by eight members of the minority, including the minority leader. For district court nominations, the new rules reduced the maximum time between cloture and a confirmation vote from 30 hours to two hours. Finally, if senators wished to block a bill or nominee after the motion to proceed, they had to be present in the Senate and debate.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of 24 June, the six RMPs of 156 Provost Company, were in Majar al-Kabir {{as part of the}} {{training}} programme for the local Iraqi police. The NCO in charge of the RMP section was Sergeant Simon Hamilton-Jewell, who had informed his Royal Military Police chain of command that he was leaving and where he and his section would be going. Despite a <b>Standing</b> <b>Order</b> that everyone be issued with a satellite phone for communication, Hamilton-Jewell was informed that none were available. The RMPs had gone to Majar al-Kabir to ask why the local police force had not intervened in a stoning two days earlier. The RMPs left Camp Abu Naji at 9:10am local time and arrived in Majar al-Kabir twenty to thirty minutes later between 9:30 and 9:40am. They were due to move on to other locations at Qalat Salih and Al Uzayr (at 14:00 to meet a senior British officer) before returning to their base around 17:00. When they arrived at the police station, their Iraqi interpreter was waiting for them and all seemed calm.|$|E
25|$|Paramedics in {{countries}} that follow the Anglo-American model normally function under the authority (medical direction) {{of one or more}} physicians charged with legally establishing the emergency medical directives for a particular region. Paramedics are credentialed and authorized by these physicians to use their own clinical judgment and diagnostic tools to identify medical emergencies and to administer the appropriate treatment, including drugs that would normally require a physician order. Credentialing may occur {{as the result of a}} State Medical Board examination (U.S.) or the National Registry of Emergency Medical Technicians (U.S.). In England, and in some parts of Canada, credentialing may occur by means of a College of Paramedicine. In these cases, paramedics are regarded as a self-regulating health profession. The final common method of credentialing is through certification by a Medical Director and permission to practice as an extension of the Medical Director's license to practice some medical acts. The authority to practice in this semi-autonomous manner is granted in the form of <b>standing</b> <b>order</b> protocols (off-line medical control) and in some cases direct physician consultation via phone or radio (on-line medical control). Under this paradigm, paramedics effectively assume the role of out-of-hospital field agents to regional emergency physicians, with clinical decision-making authority using standing orders or protocols.|$|E
25|$|Smith-Clarke {{retired in}} 1950 and Dunn {{took over as}} chief engineer. In 1950 a new chassis and six-cylinder 3–litre engine was {{announced}} and this highly successful engine became the basis of all Alvis models until production ceased in 1967. Saloon bodies for the TA 21, as the new model was called, again came from Mulliners of Birmingham as they had for the TA 14, with Tickford producing the dropheads. But with {{the first of these}} committing themselves in October 1954 to supply only Standard Triumph who purchased it in 1958 and the second being acquired by David Brown owner of Aston Martin Lagonda in late 1955, it was becoming clear that new arrangements would have to be made. Some of the most original and beautiful designs on the 3Litre chassis were being produced by master coachbuilder Carrosserie Herman Graber of Switzerland and indeed these often one-off–designed cars are highly sought after today. Graber had begun to use TA 14 chassis soon after the war building three Tropic coupés which were much admired. When the Three Litre chassis was introduced his bodies displayed at the Geneva Motor Shows in 1951 and 1952 attracted sufficient interest for Graber to set up a <b>standing</b> <b>order</b> of 30 chassis per year. Swiss-built Graber coupés were displayed on the Alvis stand at both Paris and London Motor Shows in October 1955.|$|E
