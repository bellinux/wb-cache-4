5|$|Garrow's {{work was}} cited in court as {{recently}} as 1982, when the Supreme Court of Canada quoted a passage from The Trial of William Davidson and Richard Tidd for High Treason, where Garrow instructed the jury {{as to how to}} interpret testimony, in Vetrovec v The Queen in 1982. In 2006 he was again quoted, when the Irish Court of Criminal Appeal used the <b>same</b> <b>work</b> in their review of the 1982 conviction of Brian Meehan for the murder of Veronica Guerin.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>same</b> <b>work,</b> Newton {{presented}} a calculus-like method of geometrical analysis using 'first and last ratios', gave the first analytical determination (based on Boyle's law) {{of the speed}} of sound in air, inferred the oblateness of Earth's spheroidal figure, accounted for the precession of the equinoxes {{as a result of the}} Moon's gravitational attraction on the Earth's oblateness, initiated the gravitational study of the irregularities in the motion of the moon, provided a theory for the determination of the orbits of comets, and much more.|$|E

5|$|While {{attempting}} {{to provide a}} high level of patient care for Jews, Christians, and Arabs, Shaare Zedek operated without electricity, indoor plumbing, central heating, or gas cooking stoves. Kerosene heaters were used to warm bathwater, and paraffin lamps were used in the operating room. It was difficult to retain staff due to the working conditions and to the exacting, temperamental nature of Dr. Wallach. Nevertheless, Schwester Selma worked 18-hour days, and expected her nurses and aides to display the <b>same</b> <b>work</b> ethic.|$|E
5|$|In the 1840s, {{women in}} America were {{reaching}} out for greater control of their lives. Husbands and fathers directed the lives of women, and many doors were closed to female participation. State statutes and common law prohibited women from inheriting property, signing contracts, serving on juries and voting in elections. Women's prospects in employment were dim: they could expect only to gain a very few service-related jobs and were paid about half of what men were paid for the <b>same</b> <b>work.</b> In Massachusetts, Brook Farm was founded by Sophia Ripley and her husband George Ripley in 1841 {{as an attempt to}} find a way in which men and women could work together, with women receiving the same compensation as men. The experiment failed.|$|E
5|$|Slavery was not {{abolished}} {{even after}} the Thirteenth Amendment. There were four million freedmen {{and most of them}} on the same plantation, doing the <b>same</b> <b>work</b> that they did before emancipation, except as their work had been interrupted and changed by the upheaval of war. Moreover, they were getting about the same wages and apparently were going to be subject to slave codes modified only in name. There were among them thousands of fugitives in the camps of the soldiers or {{on the streets of the}} cities, homeless, sick, and impoverished. They had been freed practically with no land nor money, and, save in exceptional cases, without legal status, and without protection.|$|E

5|$|The film {{director}} is unknown, {{but it may}} have been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Sometimes the directional credit is given to Theodore Marston. The apparent origin of this error is from the American Film-Index 1908–1915. Film historian Q. David Bowers consulted one of the co-authors of the book, Gunnar Lundquist, and confirmed that the credit of Marston was in error. Theodore Marston worked with Pathé, Kinemacolor, Vitagraph and other companies, but there is no record of Marston working with Thanhouser. This error has persisted in several works including The Complete Index to Literary Sources in Film. The <b>same</b> <b>work</b> also credits Alphonse Ethier with a role, but this is not cited by Bowers.|$|E
5|$|Worker {{termites}} {{undertake the}} most labour within the colony, {{being responsible for}} foraging, food storage, and brood and nest maintenance. Workers are tasked with the digestion of cellulose in food and are thus the most likely caste {{to be found in}} infested wood. The process of worker termites feeding other nestmates is known as trophallaxis. Trophallaxis is an effective nutritional tactic to convert and recycle nitrogenous components. It frees the parents from feeding all but the first generation of offspring, allowing for the group to grow much larger and ensuring that the necessary gut symbionts are transferred from one generation to another. Some termite species do not have a true worker caste, instead relying on nymphs that perform the <b>same</b> <b>work</b> without differentiating as a separate caste.|$|E
5|$|Gregory Mathews {{described}} the western subspecies perplexus in 1912, naming it the southwestern crow and noting {{that it was}} smaller than the nominate subspecies. He called C. coronoides coronoides the eastern crow, listing its range as New South Wales, and described {{what is now the}} Australian crow as another subspecies, C. coronoides cecilae, calling it the north-western crow and recording its range as northwestern Australia. In the <b>same</b> <b>work</b> he listed the raven as Corvus marianae, with a type specimen from Gosford and listing its range as New South Wales. He listed the little raven and forest raven as subspecies. Mathews had erected C. marianae in 1911 as the name after declaring Corvus australis Gould to be preoccupied; French-American ornithologist Charles Vaurie acted as First Revisor under Article 24 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) Code and discarded C. australis as a junior homonym—in 1788, Gmelin had used the same binomial name to describe the black nunbird—to preserve the stability of the name. This has been followed by later authors.|$|E

5|$|One {{synonym for}} the species has been {{published}} – Ponera ruginoda (also titled Myrmecia ruginoda), described by Smith in the <b>same</b> <b>work,</b> and a male holotype specimen was originally described for this synonym. Ponera ruginoda was initially placed into the genera Ectatomma and Rhytidoponera, but it was later classified as a junior synonym of the jack jumper ant, after specimens of each were compared. The ant {{is a part of}} the Myrmecia pilosula species complex, a species group that was first defined by Italian entomologist Carlo Emery. The species complex is a monophyletic group, where the species are closely related to each other but their actual genetic relationship is distant. Members of this group include M. apicalis, M. chasei, M. chrysogaster, M. croslandi, M. cydista, M. dispar, M. elegans, M. harderi, M. ludlowi, M. michaelseni, M. occidentalis M. queenslandica, M. rugosa and M. varians. Additional species that were described in this group in 2015 include M. banksi, M. haskinsorum, M. imaii and M. impaternata.|$|E
