5|$|As {{a natural}} side-effect {{of the size}} of the fuel {{elements}} and their resulting explosions, ICF designs use a very large reaction chamber many meters across. This lowers the neutron flux on any particular part of the chamber wall through the inverse square law. Additionally, there are no magnets or other complex systems near or inside the reactor, and the laser is isolated on the far side of long optical paths. The far side of the chamber is empty, allowing the blanket to be placed there and easily maintained. Although the reaction chamber walls and final optics would eventually embrittle and require replacement, the chamber is essentially a large <b>steel</b> <b>ball</b> of relatively simple multi-piece construction that could be replaced without too much effort. The reaction chamber is, on the whole, dramatically simpler than those in magnetic fusion concepts, and the LIFE designs proposed building several and quickly moving them in and out of production.|$|E

40|$|Ball mills {{are common}} {{grinding}} equipment in mineral processing industries. Ball wear results from three mechanisms namely impact, abrasion and corrosion. Of these, the corrosion mechanism {{is the least}} investigated, due to its chemical-electrochemical nature. Therefore, the aims of this research were to investigate the grinding chemistry influence (slurry pH, solid percentage, water chemistry and gas purging) on corrosive wear of <b>steel</b> <b>balls</b> and to determine the contribution of corrosion mechanism to total wear of <b>steel</b> <b>balls.</b> The {{results indicated that the}} mass losses of <b>steel</b> <b>balls</b> could be reduced considerably by controlling the pulp chemistry inside the mill. In addition, the results showed that 73. 51 % of the corrosion products are generated from the oxidation of <b>steel</b> <b>balls.</b> It was also estimated that the corrosion mechanism accounts for 26. 68 % of the total wear of <b>steel</b> <b>balls...</b>|$|R

40|$|Foreign object damage (FOD) {{behavior}} of AS 800 silicon nitride was determined using four different projectile materials at ambient temperature. The target test specimens rigidly supported were impacted at their centers by spherical projectiles with {{a diameter of}} 1. 59 mm. Four different types of projectiles were used including hardened <b>steel</b> <b>balls,</b> annealed <b>steel</b> <b>balls,</b> silicon nitride balls, and brass balls. Post-impact strength of each target specimen impacted was determined {{as a function of}} impact velocity to better understand the severity of local impact damage. The critical impact velocity where target specimens fail upon impact was highest with brass balls, lowest with ceramic ball, and intermediate with annealed and hardened <b>steel</b> <b>balls.</b> Degree of strength degradation upon impact followed the same order as in the critical impact velocity with respect to projectile materials. For <b>steel</b> <b>balls,</b> hardened projectiles yielded more significant impact damage than annealed counterparts. The most important material parameter affecting FOD was identified as hardness of projectiles and was correlated in terms of critical impact velocity, impact deformation, and impact load...|$|R

40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{ball mill}} consisting of vertical cylinder, {{equipped with a}} rotating shaft with arms, and filled with <b>steel</b> <b>balls</b> as a grinding medium {{has been used in}} the experiments. The aim {{of the study was to}} examine the effect of agitator shaft speed and amount of grinding media (<b>steel</b> <b>balls)</b> on power requirements and energy consumption of a ball mill. With constant mass of the <b>steel</b> <b>balls</b> (20 kg, 30 kg and 40 kg), the agitator shaft speed was increased from 10 % to 100 % of the maximum speed which corresponds to a speed of 50 rpm. The power consumption (W) was recorded upon which milling energy consumption (J/kg) has been calculated. The results were statistically analyzed using ANOVA. The increase of the agitator shaft speed, in steps of 10 % to the maximum speed of 50 rpm, led to a statistically significant increase in milling energy consumption. At low agitator shaft speed (10 %), increase in the mass of the <b>steel</b> <b>balls</b> had no influence on the power requirements. Power requirements for the grinding runs using 30 kg and 40 kg are similar and higher compared to power requirement in trial with 20 kg, as agitator shaft speed increases from 20 % to 70 %. At high agitator shaft speeds (≥ 80 %), increase in <b>steel</b> <b>balls</b> mass led to the significant increase in power requirements of the ball mill...|$|R

25|$|A special type of integrator, used at a {{point where}} only {{moderate}} accuracy was needed, was based on a <b>steel</b> <b>ball,</b> instead of a disc.

That axis was always in a plane that contained the axes of two movement-pickoff rollers, quite similar to the mechanism of a rolling-ball computer mouse (in this mechanism, the pickoff rollers were roughly the same diameter as the ball). The pickoff roller axes were at right angles.|$|E

25|$|His work is {{the basis}} of the falling sphere viscometer, in which the fluid is {{stationary}} in a vertical glass tube. A sphere of known size and density is allowed to descend through the liquid. If correctly selected, it reaches terminal velocity, which can be measured by {{the time it takes to}} pass two marks on the tube. Electronic sensing can be used for opaque fluids. Knowing the terminal velocity, the size and density of the sphere, and the density of the liquid, Stokes' law can be used to calculate the viscosity of the fluid. A series of <b>steel</b> <b>ball</b> bearings of different diameter is normally used in the classic experiment to improve the accuracy of the calculation. The school experiment uses glycerine as the fluid, and the technique is used industrially to check the viscosity of fluids used in processes.|$|E
25|$|The mouse {{created for}} the Apple Lisa {{was among the first}} {{commercial}} mice sold in the marketplace. Included with the Lisa system in 1983, it was based on the mouse used in the 1970s on the Alto computer at Xerox PARC. Unique to this mouse was the use of a <b>steel</b> <b>ball,</b> instead of the usual rubber found in subsequent and modern mice. It connected to the computer by means of a standard DE-9 and unique squeeze-release connector. Though developed by Apple, it was actually designed by an outside firm, Hovey-Kelley (renamed IDEO in 1991), who built hundreds of prototypes and conducted exhaustive testing with focus groups in order to create the perfect device. Their perseverance paid off as not only did they bring the design in on time and on budget, but the resulting device remained virtually unchanged for almost 20 years. It was this mouse that established Apple's mouse as a one-button device for over 20 years. Every single aspect of the mouse was researched and developed, from how many buttons to include, to how loud the click should be. The original case design was Bill Dresselhaus's and took on an almost Art Deco flavor with its formal curving lines to coordinate with the Lisa.|$|E
500|$|The Museum of Modern Art in New York City {{recognised}} the Bic Cristal's {{industrial design}} by introducing {{it into the}} museum's permanent collection. Its hexagonal shape resembles the typical wooden pencil and grants strength and three grip points giving high writing stability. The pen's transparent polystyrene barrel and polypropylene tube show the ink-level. A tiny hole in the barrel's body maintains the same air pressure {{inside and outside the}} pen. The thick ink flows down due to capillary action from the tube inside the barrel, to feed the ball bearing, which spins freely within a brass tip. In 1961 the stainless <b>steel</b> <b>ball</b> was replaced with much harder tungsten carbide. This ballpoint is first vitrified by heat, then ground down and milled to an accuracy of [...] between spinning plates coated with industrial diamond abrasives. Since 1991 the pen's streamlined polypropylene cap has had a small hole {{to reduce the risk of}} suffocation if the cap is inhaled. Polypropylene is used instead of polystyrene because it absorbs impact better, reducing the chance of the pen cracking or splitting if it is dropped onto the cap.|$|E

Although sand is used as a mould material for casting, its permeability and thermal conductivity are very low and hence affects the microstructure and mechanical properties of the cast product.

In the present work, <b>steel</b> <b>balls</b> are used as mould material and the effect of grain size on the permeability of the mould material is studied. <b>Steel</b> <b>balls</b> of different diameters namely 0. 18  mm, 0. 6  mm and 1  mm which are commercially available were used.
