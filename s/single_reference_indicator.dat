40|$|Abstract: I {{present a}} {{personal}} viewpoint on multi-reference coupled-cluster theory, its pros and cons. I also suggest some criteria {{that should be}} satisfied by multi-reference CC, {{not the least of}} which is to develop a tool that will be (almost!) as easy to apply as today’s powerful array of <b>single</b> <b>reference</b> coupled-cluster methods. Some approaches like the equation of motion CC method offers a multi-reference description of some target states, while being entirely <b>single</b> <b>reference</b> in execution. Perhaps it offers a model for further generalization to a wider array of multi-reference problems...|$|R

The method is based on the use of two synchronized stereovision systems positioned respectively in a back position and in a front position of the fire propagation direction. The two vision systems are used to obtain complementary 3 D fire points that are expressed in a <b>single</b> <b>reference</b> system and that are used to obtain a global form of the fire. To determine the coordinate transformations of each system with respect to a <b>single</b> <b>reference</b> system, a calibration procedure is carried out with a cube pattern.

SOCIO 3, TRUANT 3, ADMIN 5, AUTO 2, SALARY 1, and INTENT 2 were used as <b>reference</b> <b>indicators</b> in this model. A pair of items in teacher autonomy, i.e., AUTO 1 and AUTO 2, was allowed to estimate error covariance. In addition, the error variance for years of experience was set to zero (i.e., its standardized factor loading was equal to one).|$|R

The most frequently <b>referenced</b> <b>indicator</b> for cluster development is regional economic and jobs data. These macro level indicators are not sufficient to measure the performance inside the cluster, leaving champions and policy makers to struggle with ad-hoc trial and error experimentation. The difficulty in defining and developing a performance measurement system is addressed. This paper lays the groundwork for improved approaches towards measuring the performance of technology cluster initiatives...|$|R
