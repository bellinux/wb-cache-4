25|$|Billet Steel: When a {{high quality}} {{camshaft}} or low volume production is required, engine builders and camshaft manufacturers choose <b>steel</b> <b>billet.</b> This {{is a much more}} time consuming process, and is generally more expensive than other methods. However, the finished product is far superior. CNC lathes, CNC milling machines, and CNC camshaft grinders will be used during production. Different types of steel bar can be used, one example being EN40b. When manufacturing a camshaft from EN40b, the camshaft will also be heat treated via gas nitriding, which changes the micro-structure of the material. It gives a surface hardness of 55-60 HRC. These types of camshafts can be used in high-performance engines.|$|E

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model is developed {{to simulate the}} replacement of part of the conventional refractory lining in a continuously-operated gas-fired furnace by a permeable ceramic section. This involved a sub-model of the flow and heat transfer through the porous section of the lining linked together with another sub-model of heat transfer in the furnace chamber. The overall model was applied to predict the thermal performance of the furnace when heating <b>steel</b> <b>billets</b> to a nominal discharge temperature of 1250 degrees C. The effects of varying the emissivity, size, orientation and location of the permeable section were studied and, in addition, simulations were undertaken {{for a range of}} furnace thermal inputs and billet throughputs.
