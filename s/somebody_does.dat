25|$|Effective altruists {{argue that}} {{counterfactual}} reasoning {{is important to}} determine which course of action maximizes positive impact. Many people assume {{that the best way}} to help people is through direct methods, such as working for a charity or providing social services, but since charities and social-service providers usually can find people willing to work for them, effective altruists compare the amount of good <b>somebody</b> <b>does</b> in a conventional altruistic career to how much good would have been done had the next-best candidate been hired for the position. According to this reasoning, the impact of a career may be smaller than it appears.|$|E

This included {{the recording of}} two new Beatles songs built around solo vocal and piano tapes recorded by Lennon as well as lengthy interviews about the Beatles' career. Released in December 1995, [...] "Free as a Bird" [...] was the first new Beatles single since 1970. In March 1996, they released a second single, [...] "Real Love". Harrison refused {{to participate in the}} completion of a third song. He later commented on the project: [...] "I hope <b>somebody</b> <b>does</b> this to all my crap demos when I'm dead, make them into hit songs." ...|$|E
500|$|Musician and ambient music pioneer Brian Eno has {{praised the}} album and said, {{regarding}} the song [...] "Soon", that [...] "t {{set a new}} standard for pop. It's the vaguest music ever {{to have been a}} hit." [...] Robert Smith of The Cure discovered Loveless after a period of almost exclusively listening to [...] "disco, or Irish bands like the Dubliners" [...] as a means of avoiding his contemporaries, and said, [...] " [...] was the first band I heard who quite clearly pissed all over us, and their album Loveless is certainly one of my all-time three favourite records. It's the sound of someone [...] who is so driven that they're demented. And the fact that they spent so much time and money on it is so excellent." [...] Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins told Spin, [...] "It's rare in guitar-based music that <b>somebody</b> <b>does</b> something new [...] At the time, everybody was like, 'How the fuck are they doing this?' And, of course, it's way simpler than anybody would imagine." [...] Trey Anastasio of jam band Phish believed that [...] "Loveless [...] the best album recorded in the '90s", and wanted his band to cover the album in its entirety for a Halloween show. Robert Pollard of indie rock band Guided by Voices acknowledged the album as a source of inspiration, noting, [...] "Sometimes when I want to write lyrics, I'll listen to Loveless. Because of the way the vocals are buried, you can almost listen to the songs as if they're instrumental pieces." [...] Loveless has also been said by Jim DeRogatis to have been a considerable influence on British band Radiohead.|$|E

2500|$|Director Joel Coen {{justified}} {{his interest}} in the McCarthy novel. [...] "There's something about it– there were echoes of it in No Country for Old Men that were quite interesting for us", he said, [...] "because it was the idea of the physical work that <b>somebody</b> <b>does</b> that helps reveal who they are and is part of the fiber of the story. Because you only saw this person in this movie making things and doing things in order to survive and to make this journey, {{and the fact that you}} were thrown back on that, as opposed to any dialogue, was interesting to us." ...|$|E

It is not this world. It is not a bit like this world. In a world as it should be, Veronica, you would undoubtedly have been blown up--if not altogether, at all events partially.

6000|$|Third. Now also he feeleth {{in him a}} {{readiness}} to fall in with every temptation; a readiness, I say, continually present (Rom 7:21). This throws all down. Now despair begins to swallow him up; now he can neither pray, nor read, nor hear, nor meditate on God, but fire and smoke continually bursteth forth of the heart against him. Now sin and great confusion puts forth itself in all; yea, the more the sinner desireth to do a duty sincerely, the further off it always find itself; for by how much the soul struggleth under these distresses, by so much the more doth Satan put forth himself to resist, still infusing more poison, that if possible it might never struggle more, for strugglings are also as poison to Satan. The fly in the spider's web is an emblem of the soul in such a condition--the fly is entangled in the web; at this the spider shows himself; if the fly stir again, down comes the spider to her, and claps a foot upon her; if yet the fly makes a noise, then with poisoned mouth the spider lays hold upon her; if the fly struggle still, then he poisons her more and more. What shall the fly do now? Why, she dies, if <b>somebody</b> <b>does</b> not quickly release her. This {{is the case of}} the tempted; they are entangled in the web, their feet and wings are entangled; now Satan shows himself; if the soul now struggleth, Satan laboureth to hold it down; if it now shall make a noise, then he bites with blasphemous mouth, more poisonous than the gall of a serpent; if it struggle again, then he poisoneth more and more, insomuch that it needs, at last, must die in the net, if the man, the lord Jesus, help not out.[6] ...|$|E
