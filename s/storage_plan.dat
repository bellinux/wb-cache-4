40|$|Abstract—The {{development}} of a highly efficient management methodology for an Automated Container Terminal (ACT) poses a problem for port authorities. The focus here is on a trans-portation system for an Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) for an ACT. In this paper, we design the detailed management models, i. e., agent cooperation and container <b>storage</b> <b>planning</b> for the transportation system. Then, we optimally design systems that are constructed {{with the use of}} the designed management models. Comparisons of the systems are made to evaluate cost effectiveness based on the total construction cost and validity of the management models. Finally, a proposal is made for the most efficient management system. Index Terms—AGV transportation system, system manage-ment, agent cooperation, container <b>storage</b> <b>planning.</b> I...|$|R

40|$|The {{problems}} {{that are associated with}} <b>storage</b> <b>planning</b> in Third-Party Logistics (3 PL) warehouses are especially dynamic and complex, yet storage policy on space utilisation goes comparatively unnoticed in warehouse management. From reviewing the literature and from a deep understanding of the industry, it is understood by the authors that are proper use of space allocation strategies and storage assignment policies can ensure the maximum utilisation of space resources. Storage and retrieval in the warehouse can also be improved and made more efficient. Therefore, this paper proposes a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) -enhanced Autonomous <b>Storage</b> <b>Planning</b> System (RFID-ASPS) for 3 PL warehouses to cope with the changing patterns of customer demand and with product variety. The system integrates RFID technology and a decision support system to provide optimal solutions to a variety of storage problems. The system is preliminarily demonstrated through an experimental study in a simulated warehouse environment. The results reveal that the integration of RFID technology with a rule-based decision support system has the advantage of providing reliable suggestions for <b>storage</b> <b>planning</b> problems in a shorter time and making better use of limited space than was achieved by using previous methods.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a multi-objective power dispatching problem that uses Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PEV) as storage units. We formulate the energy <b>storage</b> <b>planning</b> as a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem, respecting PEV requirements, minimizing three different objectives and analyzing three different criteria. Two novel cost-to-variability indicators, based on Sharpe Ratio, are introduced for analyzing {{the volatility of}} the energy storage schedules. By adding these additional criteria, energy <b>storage</b> <b>planning</b> is optimized seeking to minimize the following: total Microgrid (MG) costs; PEVs batteries usage; maximum peak load; difference between extreme scenarios and two Sharpe Ratio indices. Different scenarios are considered, which are generated {{with the use of}} probabilistic forecasting, since prediction involves inherent uncertainty. Energy <b>storage</b> <b>planning</b> scenarios are scheduled according to information provided by lower and upper bounds extracted from probabilistic forecasts. A MicroGrid (MG) scenario composed of two renewable energy resources, a wind energy turbine and photovoltaic cells, a residential MG user and different PEVs is analyzed. Candidate non-dominated solutions are searched from the pool of feasible solutions obtained during different Branch and Bound optimizations. Pareto fronts are discussed and analyzed for different energy storage scenarios. Perhaps the most important conclusion from this study is that schedules that minimize the total system cost may increase maximum peak load and its volatility over different possible scenarios, therefore may be less robust...|$|R

5000|$|Thefts {{took place}} between April 10 and 12, when some staff {{returned}} to the building and fended off further attempts by looters to enter the museum until U.S. forces arrived on April 16. A special team headed by Marine Col. Matthew Bogdanos initiated an investigation on April 21. His investigation indicated that despite claims to the contrary, no U.S. forces had looted the building, {{and that there were}} three separate thefts by three distinct groups over the four days. While the staff instituted a <b>storage</b> <b>plan</b> to prevent theft and damage (also used during the Iran-Iraq War and the first Gulf War), many larger statues, steles, and friezes had been left in the public galleries, protected with foam and surrounded by sandbags. Forty pieces were stolen from these galleries, mostly the more valuable ones. Of these 13 had been recovered as of January 2005, including the three most valuable: the Sacred Vase of Warka (though broken in fourteen pieces, which was the original state it was found in when first excavated), the Mask of Warka, and the Bassetki Statue. According to museum officials, the looters concentrated on the heart of the exhibition: [...] "the Warka Vase, a Sumerian alabaster piece more than 5,000 years old; a bronze Uruk statue from the Akkadian period, also 5,000 years old, which weighs 660 pounds; and the headless statue of Entemena. The Harp of Ur was torn apart by looters who removed its gold inlay." [...] Among the stolen artifacts is the bronze Bassetki Statue, a life-size statue of a young man, originally found in the village Basitke {{in the northern part of}} Iraq, an Akkadian Empire piece that goes back to 2300 B.C. and the stone statue of King Schalmanezer, from the eighth century B.C.|$|E
