40|$|Freeze-fractured {{specimens}} of the Lα {{phase of a}} swollen quasi-ternary surfactant (cetylpyridinium chloride/hexanol/brine), have been observed by electron microscopy. The textures show the same features as those oberved by optical microscopy, viz. defects with negative Gaussian curvature (focal conic domains of the usual type) close to the phase boundary with the L 3 sponge phase, and defects with positive Gaussian curvature (focal conic domains of second species, mostly <b>spherolites)</b> close to the phase boundary with the L 1 micellar phase. We have studied in more detail this latter region : the density of <b>spherolites</b> increases as one approaches the L 1 -Lα transition, {{up to the point}} where they seemingly fill the whole space; their size distribution obeys an exponential law we explain by a simple thermodynamic model which predicts a transition when the elastic coefficient Λ = 2 K + K̅ vanishes.

40|$|International audienceFor ancient societies, {{the control}} of {{agriculture}} and animal domestication were extremely important to their development. After having domesticated different animals as livestock, ancient societies developed techniques such as manuring to improve culture yields. There are numerous evidences in archaeological records of animal breeding (bones, coprolithes, <b>spherolites).</b> Reversely, despite few studies dedicated to buildings and caves, the only evidence for manuring and breeding out of archaeological context, were acquired on recent soils (Bull et al., 1998; Birk et al., 2011). The {{aim of this study}} is to test the potential of faecal biomarkers preserved in soils to spatially resolve (at the field-scale) the strategies of land use (buildings, breeding and manuring) in ancient times. For this, faecal biomarkers (sterols and bile acids) of animals (Humans, cow, horse, pig and sheep), sediments from a septic tank (beginning of 19 th century) and soils of distinct land use (pasture and forest) were characterized. Then, archaeogical samples were analysed: (i) agricultural soils, middens and settlement layers dated back to the Bronze Age in Lake Bourget shore, (ii) settlement layers recovered during excavations in a medieval building (15 th century, Orléans). Sterols and bile acids were isolated from archaeogical samples following Zocatelli et al. (2012). Neutral fraction was further separated by flash chromatography. The alcohol fraction was silylated and analysed by GC-MS with a Polaris TRACE-GCQ. From the twenty sterols and bile acids identified, the following faecal biomarkers were found: coprostanol (Cp), methyl-coprostanol (mCp), ethyl-coprostanol (eCp), lithocholic acid (LC), deoxycholic acid (DOC), cholic acid (C), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDOC), hyodeoxycholic acid (HDOC), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDOC) and 3 α-hydroxy- 12 -oxo- 5 β-cholanoic acid (oxoDOC). To identify possible sources of faecal compounds, bile acid imprints and sterol ratios were employed: 1) (Cp+epi-Cp) /(eCp+epi-eCp); 2) (Cp+epi-Cp) /(Cp+epi-Cp+ 5 α-cholestanol); 3) (Cp+epi-Cp) /cholesterol. Sterol content of animal faeces clearly distinguished two groups: omnivores (Humans and pig) and herbivores (cow, horse and sheep). Then, Human and pig imprints were distinguished from bile acids. Faecal biomarkers were detected in all archaeogical samples (i and ii) and allowed the distinction between omnivores, herbivores and mixed faecal biomarker imprints in the sample set. Samples from middens of Lake Bourget catchment contained a mixture of Human and breeding faecal sterols. Bile acids corroborated these results. Furthermore, faecal biomarkers detected Le Bourget catchment soils formerly cultivated for millet, evidenced past manuring practices (mCp, eCp and DOC). High contents of coprostanols (Cp and eCp) and bile acids (LC, DOC and C) in settlement layers from Lake Le Bourget shore evidenced the co-occurrence of animals in the same area. Analysis of faecal materials from a medieval building in Orléans revealed only Human occupation (Cp, LC, DOC, CDOC, C and oxoDOC). Finally, this study showed that faecal biomarkers are efficient to provide information on the use of space in areas inhabited by humans. From a more general point of view, these results illustrateed that faecal biomarkers could reveal how Human societies shaped their environment through times...|$|R
40|$|The {{crystallization}} kinetics and {{the resulting}} structure and morphology of polylactide (PLA) were investigated {{in the presence of}} carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Nanocomposite samples prepared by solution and melt mixing present homogeneous filler dispersion, as observed by scanning electron microscopy. Calorimetric characterization of the nonisothermal and isothermal crystallization behavior analyzed according to Avrami's theory provides evidence of the significant impact of CNTs on the crystallization kinetics of the PLA matrix. The nucleating effect of the nanofillers is confirmed by Raman spectroscopy experiments. Indeed, during isothermal crystallization, the nanotube characteristic vibrations are strongly affected by the development of polymer crystalline phase. Additionally, CNTs increase the number of nucleation sites and thereby decrease the average <b>spherolite</b> size as observed by optical microscopy. The PLA crystal structure is not modified by the presence of CNTs, as probed by X-ray diffraction...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} the morphology, crystallization properties of reversible phase and thermal sensitive shape memory properties of CW/SMPU (Cellulose Whisker/Shape Memory Polyurethane) nano-composite, the CW/SMPU nano-composite having CW contents of 0. 1 - 3. 8 wt % were prepared. SEM investigation showed {{the evolution of}} reversible phase morphology from <b>spherolite</b> crystallization structure to uniform matrix with tiny CW aggregates {{with the addition of}} CW into the SMPU matrix. DSC and isothermal crystallization kinetic method revealed the effect of CW on crystallization properties of reversible phase and fixed phase, suggesting that the effect of CW on the crystallization of hard segment phase is not comparable with thermal history; the more CW causes the higher crystallization rate of reversible phase; the crystallization mechanism of reversible phase in nano-composite gradually evolves to heterogeneous nucleation and crystal growth in two dimensions with the increase of CW content; the excellent nucleation effect of CW for the reversible phase leads to the drop of activity energy from 134. 1 kJ/mol (N- 0), to 95. 1 kJ/mol (N- 4). Cyclic tensile tests illustrate the addition of CW content can engender rapid shape fixity ability after a relative short cooling time; the shape fixity ratio of nano-composite and the control sample after sufficient cooling all can be identically high.

40|$|The Pazanan {{oil field}} is located 150 km SE of ahvaz city in SW of Iran and {{measures}} 60 km long, 4 - 6 km wide. The caprock of this oil field were evaluated using well logs (gamma-ray and sonic logs) SEM and petrographical microscopy data. The cap rock consist of mudstone, interlayers of anhydrite and bitumens shale. Therefore, {{it can be}} classified as mudstone type. On {{the basis of our}} investigations, the Caprock can be divided in to 6 keybeds: A(Anhydrite), B(Bitumenshale & some times bitumen marls), C (mudstone with interlayers of shale & anhydrite), D (mudstone & anhydrite), E (mudstone) & F(mudstone & packstone), almost all of these units coverd by salt. Anhydrite beds show the following textures: microlitic, <b>spherolite,</b> porphyroblast, and granular. Anhydrite crystals indicate the occurrence of processes such as emplacement and calcitization. Sonic and gamma-ray well logs were used to determine lithological changes. The highest peak is correlated with mudstone units. Caprock depth varies from 2580 m(min) - 2717 m(max) [northern part], 1704 (min.) - 2444 (max.) [central part],And 2050 (min.) - 2490 (max.) [southern part] using well drilling data. It seems that that the thickness in the southern part is less than is other part. Comparing the thicknesses of different keybeds. The maximum occurs in the c-keybeds. The sedimentar : sequence of Caprock started by mudstone, packstone and interlayers of anhydrite, followed by mudstone, anhydrite, shale-marl, as well as bitumen shale, mudstone and anhydrite and finally was overlaid by salt. Lithological variation indicate a sabkha-lacustrine environment. Therefore, the hot-wet and hot-dry climate was dominated. In some cases, Caprock thickness decreases to 6 m without any gap. This thinning is related to structural deformation. Unfavorable lithologyconditions resulted is well collaps...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{influence}} of surface topography on the inflammatory response of human macrophages was investigated. For this, differently structured polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) surfaces were generated; including (i) a smooth surface of PVDF <b>spherolites</b> serving as a control, (ii) a randomly nanotextured surface with embedded alumina particles, (iii) a structure with 500 nm wide grooves, and (iv) a microstructure with 1 µm high bumps generated by laser ablation. These structures were verified by white light interferometry and X-profile analysis, and the identical chemistry of all PVDF surfaces was demonstrated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Macrophages were cultured on the different topographies and as a control for the activation capacity cells were treated with LPS for 24 hours. After seven days of culture the macrophages’ morphology clearly differed on the different topographies. Whereas the cells on the control exhibited an amoboid morphology similar to LPS stimulated macrophages, the cultivation on the microstructure resulted in streched spindle-shaped macrophages. The macrophages on the nanotexture demonstrated a round shape. To investigate the phenotype evolved from the different topographies the macrophages were stained with monoclonal antibodies against function associated surface markers. Both the microstructure and the grooved structure induced {{the expression of the}} M 1 -associated 27 E 10 and the M 2 -associated CD 163. The nanotexture did not alter the expression of these markers compared to control suggesting that the microstructure and the grooved structure induced an intermediate phenotype with both anti- and proinflammatory properties. To determine the activation state of the macrophages on the different topographies the concentrations of inflammatory mediators in the culture supernatant were measured. Some proinflammatory mediators like IL- 1 β, CCL 2 and CCL 3 were upregulated by the microstructure and LPS, whereas others like IL- 12 and CCL 5 were only induced by LPS. The LPS induced CXCL 10 was downregulated by the microstructure. The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL- 1 RN was repressed by LPS and the microstructure. These protein data could mostly be confirmed on mRNA level using a DNA microarray. The grooved and the nanotextured topography did mostly not alter the secretion of the investigated mediators compared to the control. Additionally, the DNA microarray identified further genes regulated by topography including both M 1 - associated genes like IL 1 R 1 and IL 7 R, and those associated with M 2 responses like CD 209, SEPP 1 and STAB 1. Some of the genes were regulated similarly by LPS like IL 7 R and CASP 1, whereas the regulation of others was opposed like SEPP 1 and HMOX 1. The present results demonstrate that the microstructured topography significantly affects the activation of primary human macrophages by inducing a specific cytokine and gene expression profile. This activation resulted in a subtype of macrophages with pro- but also anti-inflammatory properties. The cytokine secretion pattern and the gene expression profile clearly differed from that induced by LPS suggesting a specific activation state of the cells. The phenotype was clearly due to this particular surface since the grooved structure and the nanotexture had nearly no effect on the activation of the macrophages compared to the control. In conclusion, our data suggest that the modification of topography could influence the inflammatory potency of a biomaterial and hence could affect the biocompatibility of implants. The establishment of a transgenic cell line was a second aim of this study. The human monocytic cell line THP- 1 was transfected with a construct of the S 100 A 8 gene (coding for one protein of the 27 E 10 epitope) and the coding sequence of the fluorochrome DsRed. During cultivation the gained positive clones seperated into two populations of which the smaller one (approx. 5 % of entire population) expressed DsRed constitutively. After stimulation with PMA and PMA/LPS, respectivly, inducing the expression of the 27 E 10 epitope the majority of the transgenic cells demonstrated DsRed fluorescence. These transgenic cells offer the opportunity to monitor inflammatory processes online and to investigate the expression kinetics of the 27 E 10 antigen by fluorenscence...|$|R
