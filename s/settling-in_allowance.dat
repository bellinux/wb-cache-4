50|$|The {{scholarship}} {{offered by}} the Japan Students Services Organization (JASSO) for incoming exchange students, who study in Japan for between six months and one year, is available in JEASP. This scholarship includes a monthly stipend of JP¥80,000, international travel expenses (between the home country and Osaka) and a <b>settling-in</b> <b>allowance</b> of JP¥25,000.|$|E
30|$|Similar to the IABS, the Integrated Employment Biographies Sample (IEBS) (Jacobebbinghaus and Seth 2007) {{is based}} on the {{employee}} history and the benefit recipient history compiled in the IAB. By way of contrast, the IEBS integrates other available data sources too, such as the participants in measures and applicant pool databases. Thus, the IEBS embraces event history data on employees liable to social security, benefit recipients, persons who are searching for employment, unemployed persons and participants in measures of active labour market policy. The IEBS allows for more detailed overviews of employment histories as well as comprehensive analyses on active labour market policy. The spells related to participation in measures contain numerous cases on the following measures in active labour market policy: job-creation measures, <b>settling-in</b> <b>allowance,</b> business start-up allowance, measures to promote vocational training, German language courses and more. In its current version the IEBS covers the period from 1990 to 2008.|$|E
40|$|Active {{labour market}} policy (ALMP) covers a {{multitude}} of state measures aimed at preventing unemployment and promoting employment. The most important ALMP programmes in quantitative terms in Germany have traditionally been further vocational training, job-creation schemes and structural adjustment measures. Recently, however, newer ALMP instruments such as <b>settling-in</b> <b>allowances</b> for firms that take on hard-to-place unemployed people and business start-up allowances for previously unemployed individuals have also gained increasing importance. A comprehensive evaluation {{of the effectiveness of}} these programmes has been made possible only relatively recently as a result of administrative data being made available for scientific evaluation research. This paper assesses the effectiveness of ALMP in Germany {{on the basis of a}} review of the available empirical evaluation studies. The account is supplemented by including the results of some international evaluation studies on AMLP instruments which are also increasingly gaining importance in Germany but for which there are currently hardly any empirical evaluation studies available here. The paper concludes with a critical appreciation of the available research findings and an outlook for future research requirements.
