He starred as the title character in the 1992 film Chaplin, which earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor and won him the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. After being released in 2000 from the California <b>Substance</b> <b>Abuse</b> <b>Treatment</b> Facility and State Prison where he was on drug charges, Downey joined the cast of the TV series Ally McBeal playing Calista Flockhart's love interest. This earned him a Golden Globe Award. His character was written out when Downey was fired after two drug arrests in late 2000 and early 2001.

40|$|PurposeThis article {{describes}} Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) for <b>substance</b> <b>abuse</b> prevention and <b>treatment</b> programs {{in a community}}-based organization setting. MethodContinuous Quality Improvement (e. g., Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles) applied in healthcare and industry was adapted for <b>substance</b> <b>abuse</b> prevention and <b>treatment</b> programs in a community setting. We assessed the resources needed, acceptability and CQI feasibility for ten programs by evaluating CQI training workshops with program staff {{and a series of}} three qualitative interviews over a nine month implementation period with program participants. The CQI activities, PDSA cycle progress, effort, enthusiasm, benefits and challenges were examined. LimitationsThe study was conducted on a small number of programs. It did not assess CQI impact on service quality and intended program outcomes. FindingsResults indicated that CQI was feasible and acceptable for community-based <b>substance</b> <b>abuse</b> prevention and <b>treatment</b> programs; however, some notable resource challenges remain. Future studies should examine CQI impact on service quality and intended program outcomes. Implications for research, practice and/or societyThis project shows that it is feasible to adapt CQI techniques and processes for community-based programs <b>substance</b> <b>abuse</b> prevention and <b>treatment</b> programs.

40|$|Personality {{traits and}} {{religious}} coping are often viewed by counseling psychologists as strengths that influence how difficult situations are handled. Within the <b>substance</b> <b>abuse</b> literature, both personality traits and religious coping style are proposed to have profound impacts on <b>substance</b> <b>abuse</b> and <b>treatment</b> outcomes. The success of Twelve Step treatment programs {{is predicated on}} the notion that treatment works by affecting both “positive ” personality changes and use of positive religious coping as means for decreasing <b>substance</b> <b>abuse.</b> However, virtually no empirical research exists to account for the impact of religious coping and personality on treatment outcomes. In contrast, a large literature base exists that examines the roles of personality on <b>substance</b> <b>abuse</b> and <b>treatment</b> outcomes.

500|$|There {{is a risk}} of misuse and {{dependence}} in both patients and non-medical users of alprazolam; alprazolam's high affinity binding, high potency, and rapid onset increase its abuse potential. The physical dependence and withdrawal syndrome of alprazolam also add to its addictive nature.
