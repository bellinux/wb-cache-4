5|$|Antlia {{contains}} many faint galaxies, the brightest {{of which is}} NGC 2997 at magnitude 10.6. It is a loosely wound face-on spiral galaxy of type Sc. Though nondescript in most amateur telescopes, it presents bright clusters of young stars and many dark dust lanes in photographs. Discovered in 1997, the Antlia Dwarf is a 14.8m dwarf <b>spheroidal</b> galaxy that belongs to the Local Group of galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Cyathus helenae is {{distinguished}} from the more common C.striatus by its faint inner-surface plication (C.striatus has a more pronounced plication), the nodular arrangement of the hairs on the outer surface, and microscopically by the spore shape – ellipsoid in C.striatus, ovoid or <b>spheroidal</b> in C.helenae.|$|E
5|$|Many dwarf galaxies may orbit {{a single}} larger galaxy; the Milky Way {{has at least}} a dozen such satellites, with an {{estimated}} 300–500 yet to be discovered. Dwarf galaxies may also be classified as elliptical, spiral, or irregular. Since small dwarf ellipticals bear little resemblance to large ellipticals, they are often called dwarf <b>spheroidal</b> galaxies instead.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{not known}} why <b>spheroidals</b> allow the {{formation}} of globular clusters like Fornax 4 and Terzan 7 (of Sagittarius dwarf) long after globular clusters ceased to form in {{the main body of}} the Galactic halo. Another possibility is that [...] "young" [...] globular clusters of the outer halo like Ruprecht 106 were originally formed in now defunct dwarf <b>spheroidals.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{result would}} be the {{conversion}} of (late type) low-luminosity spiral galaxies into dwarf <b>spheroidals</b> and dwarf ellipticals.|$|R

5|$|The Andromeda Galaxy has a {{total of}} 15 {{satellite}} galaxies, including M32 and M110. Nine of these lie in a plane, which has caused astronomers to infer {{that they have a}} common origin.

5|$|A planet's {{defining}} {{physical characteristic}} {{is that it}} is massive enough for the force of its own gravity to dominate over the electromagnetic forces binding its physical structure, leading to a state of hydrostatic equilibrium. This effectively means that all planets are spherical or <b>spheroidal.</b> Up to a certain mass, an object can be irregular in shape, but beyond that point, which varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object, gravity begins to pull an object towards its own centre of mass until the object collapses into a sphere.|$|E
5|$|Among non-living things, snowflakes have {{striking}} sixfold symmetry: each flake's structure {{forming a}} record of the varying conditions during its crystallisation, with nearly the same pattern of growth on each of its six arms. Crystals in general have a variety of symmetries and crystal habits; they can be cubic or octahedral, but true crystals cannot have fivefold symmetry (unlike quasicrystals). Rotational symmetry is found at different scales among non-living things including the crown-shaped splash pattern formed when a drop falls into a pond, and both the <b>spheroidal</b> shape and rings of a planet like Saturn.|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} properties of dwarf <b>spheroidals</b> {{in the local}} group are shown to be inconsistent with star formation being truncated after the reionization epoch (z ∼ 8). Enhanced levels of [Ba/Y] in stars in dwarf <b>spheroidals</b> like Sculptor indicate strong s-process production from low-mass stars whose lifetimes are comparable with {{the duration of the}} pre-reionization epoch. The chemical evolution of Sculptor is followed using a model with SNe II and SNe Ia feedback and mass- and metallicitydependent nucleosynthetic yields for elements from H to Pb. We are unable to reproduce the Ba/Y ratio unless stars formed over an interval long enough for the low-mass stars to pollute the interstellar medium with s-elements. This robust result challenges the suggestion that most of the local group dwarf <b>spheroidals</b> are fossils of reionization and supports the case for large initial dark matter halos...|$|R
50|$|Alternatively, a {{hierarchical}} galaxy formation model is hypothesized under which a portion, possibly large, of the Milky Way's globular clusters would have {{originated in the}} accretion of other dwarf <b>spheroidals</b> like Sag DEG. The best candidate for this idea is Palomar 12.|$|R
40|$|We {{provide a}} ``Baedecker'' or travel {{guide to the}} {{directions}} on the sky where the dark matter annihilation signal may be expected. We calculate the flux of high energy gamma-rays from annihilation of neutralino dark matter in {{the centre of the}} Milky Way and the three nearest dwarf <b>spheroidals</b> (Sagittarius, Draco and Canis Major), using realistic models of the dark matter distribution. Other investigators have used cusped dark halo profiles (such as the Navarro-Frenk-White) to claim a significant signal. This ignores the substantial astrophysical evidence that the Milky Way is not dark-matter dominated in the inner regions. We show that the annihilation signal from the Galactic Centre falls by two orders of magnitude on substituting a cored dark matter density profile for a cusped one. The present and future generation of high energy gamma-ray detectors, whether atmospheric Cerenkov telescopes or space missions like GLAST, lack the sensitivity to detect any of the monochromatic gamma-ray annihilation lines. The continuum gamma-ray signal above 1 GeV and above 50 GeV may however be detectable either from the dwarf <b>spheroidals</b> or from the Milky Way itself. If the density profiles of the dwarf <b>spheroidals</b> are cusped, then the best prospects are for detecting Sagittarius and Canis Major. However, if the dwarf <b>spheroidals</b> have milder, cored profiles, then the annihilation signal is not detectable. For GLAST, an attractive strategy is to exploit the wide field of view and observe the Milky Way at medium latitudes, as suggested by Stoehr et al. This is reasonably robust against changes in the density profile. Comment: 13 pages, 3 figures, version in press at The Physical Review...|$|R
5|$|In {{the same}} work, Newton {{presented}} a calculus-like method of geometrical analysis using 'first and last ratios', gave the first analytical determination (based on Boyle's law) {{of the speed}} of sound in air, inferred the oblateness of Earth's <b>spheroidal</b> figure, accounted for the precession of the equinoxes {{as a result of the}} Moon's gravitational attraction on the Earth's oblateness, initiated the gravitational study of the irregularities in the motion of the moon, provided a theory for the determination of the orbits of comets, and much more.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, an overdensity {{of stars}} in the region was {{announced}} to be the Canis Major Dwarf, the closest satellite galaxy to Earth. However, there remains debate over whether it represents a disrupted dwarf galaxy or in fact {{a variation in the}} thin and thick disk and spiral arm populations of the Milky Way. Investigation of the area yielded only ten RR Lyrae variables—consistent with the Milky Way's halo and thick disk populations rather than a separate dwarf <b>spheroidal</b> galaxy. On the other hand, a globular cluster in Puppis, NGC 2298—which appears {{to be part of the}} Canis Major dwarf system—is extremely metal-poor, suggesting it did not arise from the Milky Way's thick disk, and instead is of extragalactic origin.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, astronomers {{discovered}} {{a completely new}} type of star cluster in the Andromeda Galaxy, which is, in several ways, very similar to globular clusters. The new-found clusters contain {{hundreds of thousands of}} stars, a similar number to that found in globular clusters. The clusters share other characteristics with globular clusters such as stellar populations and metallicity. What distinguishes them from the globular clusters is that they are much larger – several hundred light-years across – and hundreds of times less dense. The distances between the stars are, therefore, much greater within the newly discovered extended clusters. Parametrically, these clusters lie somewhere between a globular cluster and a dwarf <b>spheroidal</b> galaxy.|$|E
50|$|At large radii, radial {{velocity}} dispersion exhibit strange behavior. One {{possible explanation for}} {{this would be the}} presence of more than one stellar population.

5|$|The Andromeda Galaxy's {{two main}} companions, M32 and M110 (also known as NGC 221 and NGC 205, respectively) are faint {{elliptical}} galaxies that lie near it. M32, visible with a far smaller size of 8.7 by 6.4 arcminutes, compared to M110, appears superimposed {{on the larger}} galaxy in a telescopic view as a hazy smudge, M110 also appears slightly larger and distinct from the larger galaxy; M32 is 0.5° south of the core, M32 is 1° northwest of the core. M32 was discovered in 1749 by French astronomer Guillaume Le Gentil and has since been found to lie closer to Earth than the Andromeda Galaxy itself. It is viewable in binoculars from a dark site owing to its high surface brightness of 10.1 and overall magnitude of 9.0. M110 is classified as either a dwarf <b>spheroidal</b> galaxy or simply a generic elliptical galaxy. It is far fainter than M31 and M32, but larger than M42 with a surface brightness of 13.2, magnitude of 8.9, and size of 21.9 by 10.9 arcminutes.|$|E
25|$|The Antlia Dwarf is {{classified}} alternatively as a dwarf elliptical galaxy of type dE3.5, or {{either as a}} dwarf <b>spheroidal</b> galaxy (dSph) or as a transitional galaxy from <b>spheroidal</b> to irregular types (dSph/Irr). The last classification {{is due to a}} substantial star formation in this galaxy in the last 0.1 billion years.|$|E

These trends {{are consistent with}} a picture in which more massive <b>spheroidals</b> formed at higher redshift via "wetter" mergers involving greater dissipation. To examine growth under the favored "dry" merger hypothesis, we also examine size growth at a fixed velocity dispersion. This test, uniquely possible with our dynamical data, allows us to consider the effects of "progenitor bias. " Above our completeness limit (σ > 200 km s^(– 1)), we find size growth consistent with that inferred for the mass-selected sample, thus ruling out strong progenitor bias. To maintain continuity {{in the growth of}} massive galaxies over the past 10 Gyr, our new results imply that size evolution over 1. 3 2 are truly massive and compact. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} {{of stars in}} the process of being tidally removed from globular clusters and dwarf <b>spheroidals</b> in the Galaxy's halo provides a strong constraint on their mass to light ratios and on the extent of their possible dark matter halos. If a significant dark matter component existed either within or beyond the observed stellar distribution, then stars would not be removed. We use numerical simulations to study mass loss from two component star clusters orbiting within a deeper potential. We find a global upper limit on the mass to light ratios of globular clusters, M/L 2. 5, and rule out the possibility that they have extended halos of low luminosity material. Similarly, the tidal tails of dwarf <b>spheroidals</b> indicates that their dark matter halos must be truncated at ∼ 400 pc therefore they have total mass to light ratios 100.

40|$|We {{show that}} {{ultraviolet}} radiation, with wavelengths shorter than 2000 Å, escaping from the disks of giant spirals {{could be one}} of the principal factors affecting the evolution of low mass satellite galaxies. We demonstrate, using a semi-qualitative model, that the Lyman continuum part of the radiation field can lead to ionization of the ISM of the dwarf galaxies through the process of photoevaporation, making the ISM virtually unobservable. The FUV part (912 < λ < 2000 Å) is shown to dominate over the internal sources of radiation for most of the Galactic dwarf <b>spheroidals.</b> The proposed environmental factor could be at least partially responsible for the bifurcation of the low mass proto-galaxies into two sequences — dwarf irregulars and dwarf <b>spheroidals.</b> We discuss many peculiarities of the Local Group early-type dwarfs which can be accounted for by the impact of the UV radiation from the host spiral galaxy (Milky Way or M 31) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this contribution, {{we report}} on the {{discovery}} of dwarf <b>spheroidals</b> (dSphs) in the core of the Fornax cluster. Their photometric properties – like magnitude, colour, surface brightness – are very similar to those of Local Group dSphs. However, at a given total magnitude, dSphs in Fornax seem to be more extended than their Local Group counterparts. The membership of several dwarf galaxy candidates in Fornax has been confirmed by surface brightness fluctuation measurements on deep wide-field images taken with the Magellan telescope. The analysis of these images also confirms the flat faint end slope of the luminosity function for dSphs in Fornax which contradicts the expected large number of small dark matter halos connected to dwarf galaxies in ΛCDM theory. Dwarf <b>spheroidals</b> have also been detected in the HydraI and Centaurus cluster. A preliminary analysis of their photometric properties shows that they obey similar scaling relations as their counterparts in Fornax and the Local Group...|$|R
40|$|We compare {{chemical}} abundances of Local Group dwarf <b>spheroidals,</b> {{obtained from}} recent UVES/VLT observations, and of high redshift Damped Lyman alpha systems (DLAs), corrected for dust effects. We focus, in particular, on the abundance ratio between alpha-capture elements and iron, alpha/Fe, a well known indicator of chemical evolution.

At any given metallicity these two distinct types of astronomical targets show alpha/Fe ratios systematically {{lower than those of}} Milky Way stars. In terms of chemical evolution models, this suggests that, on average, dSph galaxies and DLA systems are characterized by lower, or more episodic, star formation rates than the Milky Way.
