5|$|The Constitution of the Soviet Union {{recognised}} the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and {{the earlier}} Central Executive Committee (CEC) of the Congress of Soviets {{as the highest}} organs of state authority in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Under the 1924, 1936 and 1977 Soviet Constitution these bodies served as the collective head of state of the Soviet Union. The Chairman of these bodies personally performed the largely ceremonial functions assigned to a <b>single</b> <b>head</b> of state but held little real power.|$|E
5|$|In 1867 a {{commission}} {{was created to}} look into issues with the central courts, and the outcome were the Judicature Acts, under which all the central courts were made part of a single Supreme Court of Judicature, with the three central common law courts becoming {{three of the five}} divisions of the Supreme Court; this was not designed to be permanent, but rather to avoid having to retire or demote two of the three Chief Justices to allow a <b>single</b> <b>head</b> of the Supreme Court, as this would have violated the constitutional principle that senior justices were irremovable. By sheer chance Fitzroy Kelly and Alexander Cockburn, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer and Lord Chief Justice of England respectively both died in 1880, allowing the merger of the common law divisions of the Supreme Court into a single division, the Queen's Bench Division, under John Coleridge, who had been Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and became Lord Chief Justice of England, by an Order in Council of 16 December 1880. At this point, the Exchequer of Pleas formally ceased to exist.|$|E
5|$|Indonesian {{artillery}} fire continued to rain {{down on the}} camp, wounding several men and sending the defenders into disarray. Sergeant-Major Williams rushed to the headquarters to order the artillery officer to bombard the taken positions before attempting to organise a counterattack himself. Whilst under heavy Indonesian fire, Williams gathered a section of defenders who had taken refuge in a slit trench and led them towards the captured outer positions. A shell landed among the group and wounded half of them, but Williams and the remainder engaged at least thirty Indonesian infantry who had been firing into the base from the trench in vicious hand-to-hand combat and managed to push them from it with minor casualties. Williams them looked to secure the perimeter, but seeing that the Indonesians were massing for a second attack, {{he sat down in}} a vacated machine gun nest and sprayed the new wave of attackers, who attempted to seize the command bunker, with fire. This was not without cost, and Williams was fortunate to have escaped with a <b>single</b> <b>head</b> wound, which nevertheless blinded him in one eye, though he did not notice this in the heat of battle. Williams then began to receive supporting rifle fire from other British troops in nearby trenches, as well bombardment from the single remaining mortar and some 105mm artillery emplacements from a nearby camp.|$|E

The transformation between the non-orthogonal measurement co-ordinate system and the Cartesian system can result in large errors in the calculated velocities. A theoretical analysis of the geometrically induced uncertainties in measurements produced by four <b>single</b> <b>headed</b> 3 D LDV configurations is presented. These considerations have lead {{to the development of a}} <b>single</b> <b>headed</b> LDV probe based around the use of two Doppler difference channels to directly measure the transverse velocity channels, and a reference beam channel to measure the on axis velocity component. The probe may be operated in two regimes, using cw radiation and wavelength division multiplexing to distinguish the three channels, or using a pulsed source and time division multiplexing. 1...|$|R

500|$|Michael Westmore was {{responsible}} for taking Probert's designs for the Ferengi and creating the make-up for the actors to meet that design. In Probert's original concept, the Ferengi had ears which were pointed like a bat. There were concerns from the producers that these would appear simply to be larger versions of the already known Vulcan ears, and so Westmore was told to round off the ears {{when it came to}} producing the make-up. Other elements which were changed at the make-up stage included modifications to the nose to increase the volume of wrinkles and dropping the idea of an extended chin as Westmore thought it would save time in applying the make-up. A set of false upper teeth were also created, which were added to a <b>single</b> <b>head</b> piece and a nose piece which comprised the prosthetics for the Ferengi. Westmore was not pleased when a shot of an actor in costume was leaked without the teeth, he said [...] "I was annoyed about that photo because the make-up was incomplete. After all the work that went into it, we would have wanted our design in proper form. The photo was like a pirated version of our make-up, because none of us would ever approved it under those circumstances." [...] Michael Okuda designed a rank designation tattoo which Westmore applied to the right part of each Ferengi forehead. The symbol means [...] "Dog eat dog" [...] and was painted green as that is the colour of American dollar bills. Each bar (referred to by the production crew as a [...] "rocker") {{to the side of the}} symbol designated a rank, with more bars meaning a higher rank.|$|E
500|$|The Alchi Sumtseg in the Alchi {{complex is}} one of the most outstanding, but its purpose is not clearly established. The Sumtseg (gSum-brtsegs) means a three storied {{building}}, though small, was built with loam and natural stone (reflected in the bland exterior) in the Tibetan building tradition. However, the luxuriant woodwork columns, facades, walls, clay images and paintings in the interior of the monastery were made by Kashmiri artists. The sanctum in the ground floor and the first floor measures x with the niches of [...] width and [...] height (niches in the main wall are larger in size vis-a-vis the side walls). The niches depict the main images of three Bodhisattvas (all in standing posture and about [...] in height) and its associate secondary deities (four in each niche) with two flying goddesses in each niche. Except for the main wooden door on the top floor, which is dilapidated, the rest of the Sumtseg is well preserved in its original form, as built in the early 13th century. The second floor of the building is more in the form of a balcony with a lantern mounting. Image of Maitreya, the largest in size (...) , is deified on the back wall and flanked by the images of Avalokiteshwara to its right and Manjushri to its left. An interesting aspect of the elegant drapery (dhotis) worn by the deities is the display of different themes printed in different textile patterns; Maitreya's dhoti depicts the life of Buddha, the Avlokiteshwara's dhoti shows holy places and royal palaces and Manjushri's dhoti has adepts (of 84 Mahasiddhas) printed on it. Iconographically, the deities have a <b>single</b> <b>head</b> with four arms but differently portrayed. Each deity is identified to a different Buddha. Maitreya has a five Buddha crown representing Vairochana. Avalokiteshwara's crown represents Amitabha and Manjushri's crown represents Akshobhya. An inscription in the main niche states that the three images are reliquaries representing body, speech and mind-compared to the three bodies of the Buddha-namely, Maitreya denoting the Buddha body of reality, Avolokiteshwara representing pure rapture and Manjushri representing emanational body. In simple terms, they represent the Buddhist concepts of Compassion, Hope and Wisdom.|$|E
2500|$|As derived species {{no longer}} have {{transversal}} processes on their vertebrae—again a condition unique in the Amniota—the parapophyseal and diapophysael rib joints {{have been reduced to}} flat facets, at least one of which is located on the vertebral body.

2500|$|A major {{innovation}} was the front-loading arrangement. Pioneer's angled cassette bay and {{the exposed}} bays of some Sansui models eventually were standardized as a front-loading door into which a cassette would be loaded. Later models would adopt electronic buttons, and replace conventional meters (which could be [...] "pegged" [...] when overloaded) with electronic LED or vacuum fluorescent displays, with level controls typically being controlled by either rotary controls or side-by-side sliders. BIC and Marantz briefly offered models {{that could be}} run at double speeds, but Nakamichi was widely {{recognized as one of}} the first companies to create decks that rivaled reel-to-reel decks with frequency response from the full 20–20,000Hz range, low noise, and very low wow and flutter. The 3-head closed-loop dual capstan Nakamichi 1000 (1973) is one early example. Unlike typical cassette decks that use a <b>single</b> <b>head</b> for both record and playback plus a second head for erasing, the Nakamichi 1000, like the better reel-to-reel recorders, used three separate heads to optimize these functions.|$|E
2500|$|Although an {{experienced}} and expert hunter of wild game, his death is officially {{reported to have}} been caused by being mauled by a wounded buffalo. [...] However, in one anonymous contemporary newspaper article which appeared in 1914, it was claimed that the adjutant-commandant of a French Colonial Army fort located just outside Fort Archambault, who retrieved his body after his death, had found that Latham had sustained a <b>single</b> <b>head</b> wound and saw no marks on or around Latham's body consistent with a rampaging buffalo. [...] The writer claimed that the commandant believed, based on the physical evidence and on the conflicting reports of the porters under questioning, that it was possible Latham had been murdered by one of more of his porters, perhaps in order to steal his rifles, but was unable to prove it. Latham was originally buried in Fort Lamy (now N'djamena, capital city of Chad), because French colonial law forbade the transport of any human remains to another country until a full year had lapsed since death. [...] In January 1914 Latham's mother arranged to have her son's corpse disinterred and shipped to Le Havre where he was re-interred in the family plot. He had never married and thus left no direct descendants.|$|E
2500|$|The Tang dynasty founder Emperor Gaozu {{initially}} {{followed the}} Sui's system of governance, including the five-bureau organization. However, he deviated from his predecessors {{by creating a}} <b>single</b> <b>head</b> for the executive bureau, known as the Shàngshūlǐng (尚書令) and appointed the office to his second son and future emperor Lǐ Shìmín (李世民). After Li Shimin became emperor in 626, the office was left vacant because none of his officials dared to occupy it. Thus from the year 626 the executive bureau was headed by its two vice-directors, the Shàngshūpúshè. Around this time, probably by Emperor Taizong's orders, the institution of multiple chancellors was formalized, with {{the heads of the}} executive, examination, and legislative (which was renamed the Zhōngshūshěng (中書省)) bureaus regarded as the chancellors. As there were often, but not always, more than one head for the examination and legislative bureaus, there were not necessarily only four chancellors. Emperor Taizong's reign also began to designate certain high-level officials, even though they were not heads of one of the bureaus, as chancellors, with titles such as Cānyù Cháozhèng (參豫朝政, literally [...] "participator in the administration's governance"). Yet later in 643, he revised the designation and formalized it as the Tóngzhōngshūménxiàsānpǐn (同中書門下三品, literally meaning [...] "equivalent to the officials with the third rank from the Zhōngshū and the Ménxià") — because the heads of the legislative bureau, the Zhōngshūlǐng (中書令), and the examination bureau, the Shìzhōng (侍中), were of the third rank. These officials were rendered as [...] "chancellors de facto'" [...] Shízhìzǎixiàng (實質宰相) by the Chinese historian Bo Yang in his modern Chinese edition of the Zizhi Tongjian.|$|E
40|$|Food {{production}} at home requires money and time. Food assistance programs focus {{exclusively on the}} money cost, while ignoring the time cost. This one-dimensional focus could undermine the effectiveness of food assistance programs. In the spirit of Vickery (1977), this paper uses a cost difference approach to develop a money-time threshold, and several related metrics, to determine whether money or time is the most limiting resource in reaching the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) target. In our empirical analysis we find that when time is ignored, <b>single</b> <b>headed</b> households spend on average 35 % more than required to meet the TFP target. However, when time is included, these households spend on average 40 % less than required to meet the TFP target. In addition, we find that when time is ignored, 62 % of <b>single</b> <b>headed</b> households on average spend enough money to reach the TFP target, but when time is included, only 13 % of <b>single</b> <b>headed</b> households spend enough on average to reach the TFP target. Our empirical results suggest that time is more constraining than money in reaching the TFP target. These results imply that metrics solely focusing on money could severely underestimate the gap between actual expenditures and those required to reach the TFP target.

40|$|Myosin-V is a two-headed {{molecular}} motor taking multiple ATP-dependent {{steps toward the}} plus end (forward) of actin filaments.

The detailed mechanism underlying this mechanical asymmetry is not known. We investigate the effect of force on individual <b>single</b> <b>headed</b> myosin-V constructs bound to actin in the absence of ATP. If pulled forward, the myosin-V head dissociates at forces twice as high than if pulled backward. Moreover, backward but not forward distances to the unbinding barrier are dependent on the lever arm length.
