5|$|At the White House, brainwashed teleporting mutant Nightcrawler {{attempts}} to assassinate the President of the United States but fails and escapes. Meanwhile, Wolverine explores an abandoned military installation at Alkali Lake in Alberta {{for clues to}} his past, but finds nothing. He returns to Professor Xavier's school for mutants, and Xavier tracks Nightcrawler using Cerebro. Xavier and Cyclops go to question the imprisoned Magneto about the attack, while X-Men Storm and Jean Grey retrieve Nightcrawler. Meanwhile, military scientist Colonel William Stryker approaches the president and receives approval to investigate Xavier's mansion for their ties to mutants. Stryker's forces invade the school and abduct <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students.</b> Colossus leads the remaining students to safety while Wolverine, Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro escape, and Stryker's assistant Yuriko Oyama captures Cyclops and Xavier. During the attack Wolverine confronts Stryker, who knows him by name.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in late 2004 {{the debate}} {{concerning}} coeducation resurfaced when, citing decreased enrollment, Wells College {{announced that it}} would adopt coeducation. In response, there were student protests on campus. Parents of students also became involved in the protests, as did many alumnae. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> stated that their protests were patterned after those at Mills College in the early 1990s. A website called Wells for Women was also established. When the decision to adopt coeducation was approved, students filed a lawsuit that was eventually rejected. Wells became coeducational in 2005.|$|E
25|$|During the 18th century, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> {{at colleges}} {{such as those}} in Sárospatak and Székelyudvarhely were minor nobles from rural areas who brought with them their {{regional}} styles of music. Whilst the choirs in these colleges adopted a more polyphonic style, the students' songbooks indicate a growth in the popularity of homophonic songs. Their notation, however, was relatively crude and no extensive collection appeared until the publication of Ádám Pálóczi Horváth’s Ötödfélszáz Énekek in 1853. These songs indicate that during the mid to late 18th century the previous Hungarian song styles died out and musicians looked more to other (Western) European styles for influence.|$|E
25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II, work on the Great Hall ceased. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> enlisted {{in the armed forces}} while others assisted on the home front. Montsalvat was turned into a farm and market garden. Jörgensen and his now smaller 'team' turned their creative abilities to these new projects, building the barns and sheds. Materials were scarce, but they managed to scrounge odd bits and pieces – from discarded broken bricks and rusty galvanized iron to timber poles cut from the bush. Additional to the market garden was the dairy and poultry farm with the produce being sold through the local markets.|$|E

25|$|After {{the first}} two shootings, Harris removed his trench coat and aimed his 9mm carbine down the west {{staircase}} toward three youths: 15-year-olds Daniel Rohrbough and Sean Graves and 16-year-old Lance Kirklin. The three friends had been ascending the staircase directly below the shooters. Kirklin later reported seeing Klebold and Harris standing {{at the top of}} the staircase before the pair opened fire. All three youths were shot and wounded. Inside the school, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> had believed that they were bearing witness to a senior prank by the two seniors. But in the cafeteria, Dave Sanders, a computer and business teacher as well as a varsity coach, quickly realized it was not a prank but a deliberate attack on the school.|$|E
25|$|In 1768, {{the missionaries}} were jailed {{for three months}} when Siamese {{authorities}} complained to the local ruler Mạc Thiên Tứ that the school had afforded shelter to a fugitive Siamese prince. Pigneau was put into a cangue, a wooden and iron frame fastened around his limbs weighing eight pounds. He ignored family requests to return to France, saying that his missionary work {{was more important than}} a comfortable life. In 1769, the school was attacked by Chinese and Cambodian pirates, who massacred <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> and burnt down the establishment... Pigneau was forced to flee in December 1769 with the survivors to Pondicherry, then a French territory, after a long sea journey through Malacca. The College was established a few miles from Pondicherry, in Virampatnam.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} of 5–11 December, the student demonstrators also built a {{temporary}} mausoleum for Thant {{on the grounds of}} the RUSU and gave anti-government speeches. In the early morning hours of 12 December 1974, government troops stormed the campus, killed <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> guarding the makeshift mausoleum, removed Thant's coffin, and reburied in Kandawmin Garden Mausolea near the Shwedagon Pagoda, where it has continued to lie. Upon hearing of the storming of the Rangoon University campus and the forcible removal of Thant's coffin, many people rioted in the streets of Rangoon. Martial law was declared in Rangoon and the surrounding metropolitan areas. What has come to be known as the U Thant crisis—the student-led protests over the shabby treatment of Thant by the Ne Win government—was crushed by the Burmese government.|$|E

25|$|The Singapore Sports School is for {{students}} who are perceived by the school to excel in sports it offers. This includes swimming, badminton, table tennis, soccer, golf, track and field, and sailing. It was opened in January 2004 and the school takes students directly into the school provided they have an active background in the sports offered by the school. When the school had its first intake, many students applied who were judged to excel in their sport but were posted to the Normal (Academic) or Normal (Technical) streams. The school rejected these pupils as the school sought pupils who excelled both physically and academically. The school was criticised for being too result wise instead of grooming them into future sportspeople. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> were finally accepted on an appeal basis after that. Students in the school aim for the International Baccalaureate (IB) paper, similar to the Singapore Arts School.|$|E
25|$|The Armistice of Mudros, the {{subsequent}} occupation of İstanbul, and the incompetence {{of the government}} in İstanbul had important effects on the school. As the school was given only 2 days to evacuate the building by the commander of the occupying forces, most of the valuable library and the educational material had to be left behind. The school was not able to find a suitable building for a long time, and some students continued their education in different buildings, sometimes in different schools. Nonetheless, the faculty was still very strong and many of the teachers, such as Hasan Ali Yücel, Mazhar Nedim, Memduh Şevket Esendal, would become the prominent figures and/or leaders that contributed to the shaping of the society, ideological basis, and the governance of the Republic of Turkey. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> and many alumni would join Atatürk in his struggle for independence at very early stages, and some would lose their lives during the battles.|$|E
25|$|Despite the oppression, {{sporadic}} {{protests against}} the government continued. Students led protests in 1965, December 1969, and December 1970. These demonstrations took place mainly on campuses located in the cities of Rangoon, Mandalay and Moulmein and were often followed by the closure of universities and colleges. In June 1974, workers from more than 100 factories throughout the nation participated in a strike, to which the government reacted by shooting about 100 workers and students on 6 June 1974 at the Thamaing Textile Factory and the Sinmalaik Dock Yard in Rangoon. Since Ne Win was in Australia on an official visit at the time, responsibility for these shootings is unclear. On 5 December 1974, students turned the funeral of former UN Secretary General U Thant into a demonstration, snatching the coffin {{on display at the}} Kyaikkasan Race Course and erecting a makeshift mausoleum {{on the grounds of the}} former Student Union building in protest against the government for not honouring their famous countryman with a state funeral. The military stormed the campus on 11 December killing <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students,</b> recovered the coffin and buried U Thant at the foot of the Shwedagon pagoda, next to the tomb of Thakin Kodaw Hmaing.|$|E

40|$|Online {{discussion}} {{boards are}} often used in traditional courses, hybrid courses, and fully online courses. Online chats and discussions can be particularly useful in fully online courses, as these communication connections are often students’ only means of connecting {{with each other and}} sharing ideas in an open forum. While traditional face-to-face courses, and even some hybrid courses, have <b>the</b> benefit <b>of</b> an in-class discussion, fully online courses often have the discussion board or chat functions as a means of class interaction. As professors continue forays into online-tool use, it is important to examine what the literature says, so far, regarding <b>some</b> <b>of</b> these tools. This research synthesis, therefore, investigates <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> outcomes <b>of</b> discussion board/chat use in online learning...|$|R
25|$|Harris was {{replaced}} by Howard S. McDonald, who had received a doctorate from the University of California. McDonald was used to an organization which placed the president {{at the head of}} decision-making, rather than a Board of Trustees. Because of this, {{he had a lot of}} trouble working with the Board, who at BYU had more power than he was accustomed to. However, he achieved several valuable things in his four-year tenure. When he first received the position, the Second World War had just ended, and thousands of students were flooding into BYU. By the end of his stay, the school had grown nearly five times to an enrollment of 5,440 students. The university did not have the facilities to handle such a large influx, so he bought part of an Air Force Base in Ogden, Utah, and rebuilt it to house <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students.</b> McDonald also did several other things. When asked by church leaders whether support for the college be dropped, he answered an adamant no, putting an end to the last real question of the school's survival. He also began a significant building program which was continued by his successors. McDonald resigned in 1949 in order to work at a Los Angeles College fitting his administrative style better.|$|E
25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> {{and professors}} persuaded others still {{sitting on the}} lower tiers of the Monument {{to get up and}} leave, while {{soldiers}} beat them with clubs and gunbutts and prodded them with bayonets. Witnesses heard bursts of gunfire. At about 5:10 am, the students began to leave the Monument. They linked hands and marched through a corridor to the southeast, though some departed through the north. Those who refused to leave were beaten by soldiers and ordered to join the departing procession. Having removed the students from the square, soldiers were ordered to relinquish their ammunition, after which they were allowed a short reprieve from 7:00 am to 9:00 am. The soldiers were then ordered to clear the square of all debris left over from the student occupation. The debris was either piled and burnt on the square, or placed in large plastic bags that were then airlifted away by military helicopters. After the cleanup of the square was completed the troops stationed at The Great Hall of the People remained confined within for the next nine days. During this time the soldiers were left to sleep on the floors and fed a single packet of instant noodles split between three men daily. Officers apparently suffered no such deprivation, and were served regular meals apart from their troops.|$|E
