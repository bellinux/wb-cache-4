50|$|The VIC chip had {{readable}} scan-line counters {{but could}} not generate interrupts based on the <b>scan</b> <b>position</b> (as the VIC-II chip could). However, the two VIA timer chips could be tricked into generating interrupts at specific screen locations, by setting up the timers after a position had been established by repetitive reading of the scan-line counter, and letting them run {{the exact number of}} cycles that pass by during one full screen update. Thus it was possible, but difficult, to e.g. mix graphics with text above or below it, or to have two different background and border colors, or to use more than 200 characters for the pseudo-high-resolution mode.

50|$|White-light {{interferometry}} scanning (WLS) systems capture intensity data at {{a series}} of positions along the vertical axis, determining where the surface is located by using {{the shape of the}} white-light interferogram, the localized phase of the interferogram, or a combination of both shape and phase. The white light interferogram actually consists of the superposition of fringes generated by multiple wavelengths, obtaining peak fringe contrast as a function of <b>scan</b> <b>position,</b> that is, the red portion of the object beam interferes with the red portion of the reference beam, the blue interferes with the blue, and so forth. In a WLS system, an imaging interferometer is vertically scanned to vary the optical path difference. During this process, {{a series of}} interference patterns are formed at each pixel in the instrument field of view. This results in an interference function, with interference varying as a function of optical path difference. The data are stored digitally and processed {{in a variety of ways}} depending on the system manufacturer, including being Fourier-transformed into frequency space, subject to cross-correlation methods, or analysis in the spatial domain.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{assessment}} of aboveground tree biomass (AGB) {{is essential to}} the evaluation of tree populations in forests, open landscapes, and urban areas. The predominant method used to determine AGB relies on error-prone functions derived from the statistical relationships of tree attributes and biomass. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) offers a new approach that replaces statistical AGB estimates with consistent measurements. Aboveground tree biomass (AGB) comprises stems and branches. While the biomass {{assessment of}} stems is straightforward, TLS measurements of tree crowns are far more complex because of branch overlapping. Because placing reflecting targets in the crowns of tall standing trees is impractical, yet necessary for merging the point clouds from different laser <b>scan</b> <b>positions,</b> TLS measurements often fail in operational applications. This study introduces a straightforward algorithm that simplifies biomass measurements of complex branch geometries using TLS and derives AGB by averaging measurements from individual <b>scanning</b> <b>positions.</b> We verified our approach through an experimental setup of branching systems with different complexities and known true biomass volumes. The results show that biomass extraction from branches by TLS systems is not affected by scanning distance. The combination of biomass measurements from individual <b>scanning</b> <b>positions</b> by averaging provides reliable biomass figures. Compared to the known true biomass figures, the overall accuracies achieved by our approach are 95 % or higher, which brings the operational application of TLS for AGB measurements within tangible reach...|$|R

In this work we develop an automated 4 D-CT sorting algorithm that performs {{without the aid}} of data collected from an external respiratory surrogate. The sorting algorithm requires an overlapping cine scan protocol. The overlapping protocol provides a spatial link between couch positions. Beginning with a starting <b>scan</b> <b>position,</b> images from the adjacent <b>scan</b> <b>position</b> (which spatial match the starting <b>scan</b> <b>position)</b> are selected by maximizing the normalized cross correlation (NCC) of the images at the overlapping slice position. The process was continued by 2 ̆ 7 daisy chaining 2 ̆ 7 all couch positions using the selected images until an entire 3 D volume was produced. The algorithm produced 16 phase volumes to complete a 4 D-CT dataset. Additional 4 D-CT datasets were also produced using external marker amplitude and phase angle sorting methods. The image quality of the volumes produced by the different methods was quantified by calculating the mean difference of the sorted overlapping slices from adjacent couch positions. The NCC sorted images showed a significant decrease in the mean difference (p 3 ̆c 0. 01) for the five patients...|$|E

FATE also include pleura scanning.|$|R
30|$|The {{correlations}} {{which were}} particularly strong {{can be interpreted}} clinically in a straightforward manner. For example, the strong correlation seen between the diagnosis of a pneumothorax {{and the quality of}} the R 1 and L 1 images follows from the fact that this condition is usually detected by placing in the ultrasound probe in those positions in typical clinical practice. Similarly, the detection of a pleural effusion correlated well with image quality ratings in the 3 rd and 4 th positions. Given that these are the typical anatomic locations where clinicians investigate for effusions, it provides further support for ACTS ability to identify lung sonography competency. Moreover, the absence of correlations between certain view positions and the presence of certain pathophysiologies provide additional support. For example, strong correlation between pneumothorax and the 4 th <b>scanning</b> <b>position</b> or consolidation and the 1 st <b>scanning</b> <b>position</b> would not be expected based on thoracic anatomy, and were not found in our study.|$|R
