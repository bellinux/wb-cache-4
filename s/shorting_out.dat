5|$|Responsibility for {{the design}} and {{construction}} of the electromagnetic separation plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which {{came to be called}} Y-12, was assigned to Stone & Webster. The design called for five first-stage processing units, known as Alpha racetracks, and two units for final processing, known as Beta racetracks. In September 1943 Groves authorized construction of four more racetracks, known as Alpha II. When the plant was started up for testing on schedule in October 1943, the 14-ton vacuum tanks crept out of alignment because {{of the power of the}} magnets, and had to be fastened more securely. A more serious problem arose when the magnetic coils started <b>shorting</b> <b>out.</b> In December Groves ordered a magnet to be broken open, and handfuls of rust were found inside. Groves then ordered the racetracks to be torn down and the magnets sent back to the factory to be cleaned. A pickling plant was established on-site to clean the pipes and fittings.|$|E

The second Alpha I was not operational until the end of January 1944; the first Beta and first and third Alpha I's came online in March, and the fourth Alpha I became operational in April. The four Alpha II racetracks were completed between July and October 1944.|$|E
25|$|A Coast Guard {{investigation}} concluded several {{facts about}} the Marine Sulphur Queen which, by themselves, should have prevented the ship from going to sea at all. The most important were the incidents of fire beneath and {{along the sides of}} the four large sulphur tanks; according to former crewmen these fires were so common that ship's officers gave up sounding the fire alarm. On one occasion the ship sailed into a New Jersey harbor, off-loaded cargo, and sailed out with a fire still burning. When a fire was actually put out, the sulphur would puddle and cake around equipment, once <b>shorting</b> <b>out</b> a major electrical generator. Caked sulphur was also found in spaces below the tanks, due to many cracks in the structure.|$|E

A more serious problem arose when the magnetic coils started <b>shorting</b> <b>out.</b> In December Groves ordered a magnet broken open, and handfuls of rust were found inside. Moisture was also a problem in its own right, as was the winding of the wire, which was too tight. Groves ordered the racetracks to be torn down and the magnets sent back to the factory to be cleaned and rewound. Rigid standards for preparation and cleanliness were instituted to prevent a recurrence of these problems.|$|E
500|$|Unable to fire {{her main}} or {{secondary}} batteries {{at the three}} destroyers causing her so much trouble, Hiei instead concentrated on SanFrancisco, which was passing by only [...] away. Along with Kirishima, Inazuma, and Ikazuchi, the four ships made repeated hits on SanFrancisco, disabling her steering control and killing Admiral Callaghan, Captain Cassin Young, {{and most of the}} bridge staff. The first few salvos from Hiei and Kirishima consisted of the special fragmentation bombardment shells, which reduced damage to the interior of SanFrancisco and may have saved her from being sunk outright. Not expecting a ship-to-ship confrontation, it took the crews of the two enemy battleships several minutes to switch to armor-piercing ammunition, and SanFrancisco, almost helpless to defend herself, managed to momentarily sail clear of the melee. She had landed at least one shell in Hieis steering gear room during the exchange, flooding it with water, <b>shorting</b> <b>out</b> her power steering generators, and severely inhibiting Hieis steering capability.
