However, a clear experimental verification of this heating process has not been done, to our knowledge. In this work, we examine electron heating during the interaction of multiple laser pulses with ultra-thin foils (a few atomic layers wide) through numerical particle-in-cell and particle-particle simulations.

40|$|Spacecraft {{measurements}} {{show that}} protons undergo substantial perpendicular heating during their transit from the Sun {{to the outer}} heliosphere. In this paper, we use Helios 2 measurements to investigate whether <b>stochastic</b> <b>heating</b> by low-frequency turbulence is capable of explaining this perpendicular heating. We analyze Helios 2 magnetic-field measurements in low-β fast-solar-wind streams between heliocentric distances r= 0. 29 AU and r= 0. 64 AU to determine the rms amplitude of the fluctuating magnetic field, δ B_ p, near the proton gyroradius scale ρ_ p. We then evaluate the <b>stochastic</b> <b>heating</b> rate Q_ stoch using the measured value of δ B_ p and a previously published analytical formula for Q_ stoch. Using Helios measurements we estimate the `empirical' perpendicular heating rate Q_ emp = (k_ B/m_ p) B V (d/dr) (T_ p/B) {{that is needed to}} explain the T_ p profile. We find that Q_ stoch∼ Q_ emp, but only if a key dimensionless constant appearing in the formula for Q_ stoch lies within a certain range of values. This range is approximately the same throughout the radial interval that we analyze and is consistent with the results of numerical simulations of the <b>stochastic</b> <b>heating</b> of test particles in reduced magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. These results support the hypothesis that <b>stochastic</b> <b>heating</b> accounts for much of the perpendicular proton heating occurring in low-β fast-wind streams.

40|$|The solar {{atmosphere}} is structured and inhomogeneous both horizontally and vertically. The omnipresence of coronal magnetic loops implies gradients of the equilibrium plasma quantities like the density, magnetic field and temperature. These gradients {{are responsible for}} the excitation of drift waves that grow both within the two-component fluid description (in the presence of collisions and without it) and within the two-component kinetic descriptions (due to purely kinetic effects). In the present work the effects of the density gradient in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field vector are investigated within the kinetic theory, in both electrostatic and electromagnetic regimes. The electromagnetic regime implies the coupling of the gradient-driven drift wave with the Alfven wave. The growth rates for the two cases are calculated and compared. It is found that, in general, the electrostatic regime is characterized by stronger growth rates, as compared with the electromagnetic perturbations. Also discussed is the <b>stochastic</b> <b>heating</b> associated with the drift wave. The released amount of energy density due to this heating should be more dependent on the magnitude of the background magnetic field than on the coupling of the drift and Alfven waves. The <b>stochastic</b> <b>heating</b> is expected to be much higher in regions with a stronger magnetic field. On the whole, the energy release rate caused by the <b>stochastic</b> <b>heating</b> can be several orders of magnitude above the value presently accepted as necessary for a sustainable coronal heating.

40|$|<b>Stochastic</b> <b>heating</b> {{of small}} grains is often {{mentioned}} as a primary cause of large infrared (IR) fluxes from star-forming galaxies, e. g. at 24 μ m. If the mechanism does work at a galaxy-wide scale, it should show up at smaller scales as well. We calculate temperature probability density distributions within a model protostellar core for four dust components: large silicate and graphite grains, small graphite grains, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon particles. The corresponding spectral energy distributions are calculated and compared with observations of a representative infrared dark cloud core. We show that <b>stochastic</b> <b>heating,</b> induced by the standard interstellar radiation field, cannot explain high mid-IR emission toward {{the centre of the}} core. In order to reproduce the observed emission from the core projected centre, in particular, at 24 μ m, we need to increase the ambient radiation field by a factor of about 70. However, the model with enhanced radiation field predicts even higher intensities at the core periphery, giving it a ring-like appearance, that is not observed.
