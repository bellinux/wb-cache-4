40|$|AbstractEpithelial–mesenchymal {{transformation}} (EMT) {{occurs during}} both development and tumorigenesis. Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) ligands signal EMT in the atrioventricular (AV) cushion {{of the developing}} heart, a critical <b>step</b> in <b>valve</b> formation. TGFβ signals through a complex of type I and type II receptors. Several type I receptors exist although activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) 5 mediates the majority of TGFβ signaling. Here, we demonstrate that ALK 2 is sufficient to induce EMT in the heart. Both ALK 2 and ALK 5 are expressed throughout the heart with ALK 2 expressed abundantly in endocardial cells of the outflow tract (OFT), ventricle, and AV cushion. Misexpression of constitutively active (ca) ALK 2 in non-transforming ventricular endocardial cells induced EMT, while caALK 5 did not, thus demonstrating that ALK 2 activity alone is sufficient to stimulate EMT. Smad 6, an inhibitor of Smad signaling downstream of ALK 2, but not ALK 5, inhibited EMT in AV cushion endocardial cells.

40|$|AbstractHeart valve malformations {{are one of}} {{the most}} common types of birth defects, {{illustrating}} the complex nature of valve development. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling is one pathway implicated in valve formation, however its specific spatial and temporal roles remain poorly defined. To decipher these contributions, we use two inducible dominant negative approaches in mice to disrupt VEGF signaling at different stages of embryogenesis. At an early <b>step</b> in <b>valve</b> development, VEGF signals are required for the full transformation of endocardial cells to mesenchymal cells (EMT) at the outflow tract (OFT) but not atrioventricular canal (AVC) endocardial cushions. This role likely involves signaling mediated by VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR 1), which is highly expressed in early cushion endocardium before becoming downregulated after EMT. In contrast, VEGFR 2 does not exhibit robust cushion endocardium expression until after EMT is complete. At this point, VEGF signaling acts through VEGFR 2 to direct the morphogenesis of the AVC cushions into mature, elongated valve leaflets. This latter role of VEGF requires the VEGF-modulating microRNA, miR- 126. Thus, VEGF roles in the developing valves are dynamic, transitioning from a differentiation role directed by VEGFR 1 in the OFT to a morphogenetic role through VEGFR 2 primarily in the AVC-derived valves...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{heart is}} the most common site of {{congenital}} defects, and valvuloseptal defects are the most common of the cardiac anomalies seen in the newborn. The process of endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) in the cardiac cushions is a required <b>step</b> during early <b>valve</b> development, and Notch signaling is required for this process. Here we show that Notch activation induces the transcription of both subunits of the soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) heterodimer, GUCY 1 A 3 and GUCY 1 B 3, which form the nitric oxide receptor. In parallel, Notch also promotes nitric oxide (NO) production by inducing Activin A, thereby activating a PI 3 -kinase/Akt pathway to phosphorylate eNOS. We thus show that the activation of sGC by NO through a Notch-dependent autocrine loop is necessary to drive early EndMT in the developing atrioventricular canal (AVC) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} the {{fundamentals}} for fabrication of stepped microstructures from fluorinated polymers using the LIGA technique are discussed. By means of these developments, {{applicability of the}} LIGA technique has been enhanced considerably. The process developed to fabricate micropatterned molding tools for plastic molding of LIGA microstructures with two or more level heights is described. A first single-step LIGA molding tool is used to structure a modified resist layer by plastic molding. This pre-structured resist layer is then structured by deep-etch X-ray lithography and subsequently used as a negative mold for electroforming of the stepped molding tool. Using this molding tool LIGA microstructures with a real three-dimensional shape have been produced by plastic molding. The essential developments are shown. In LIGA technique, PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate) is the molding material preferred for plastic molding. However, many applications, especially in medical and environmental technologies, require materials with high chemical and thermal stability. Especially for this, fluorinated polymers are well suited but could not be microstructured by the LIGA process so far. Therefore the process of vacuum hot embossing of microstructures from PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) was developed. The potentials of both developments are demonstrated by the example of molded <b>stepped</b> micro <b>valve</b> plates of PMMA and PVDF.

Understanding the cellular processes and molecules that regulate valve formation and remodeling is required to develop effective therapies. In the developing heart, epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) in a subpopulation of endocardial cells in the atrioventricular cushion (AVC) is an important <b>step</b> in <b>valve</b> formation. Transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) {{has been shown to be}} an important regulator of AVC endocardial cell EMT in vitro and mesenchymal cell differentiation in vivo. Recently Par 6 c (Par 6) has been shown to function downstream of TGFβ to recruit Smurf 1, an E 3 ubiquitin ligase, which targets RhoA for degradation to control apical-basal polarity and tight junction dissolution. We tested the hypothesis that Par 6 functions in a pathway that regulates endocardial cell EMT. Here we show that the Type I TGFβ receptor ALK 5 is required for endocardial cell EMT. Overexpression of dominant negative Par 6 inhibits EMT in AVC endocardial cells, whereas overexpression of wild-type Par 6 in normally non-transforming ventricular endocardial cells results in EMT. Overexpression of Smurf 1 in ventricular endocardial cells induces EMT. Decreasing RhoA activity using dominant negative RhoA or small interfering RNA in ventricular endocardial cells also increases EMT, whereas overexpression of constitutively active RhoA in AVC endothelial cells blocks EMT.

Revealing the cellular processes and molecules that regulate valve formation and remodeling is required to develop effective therapies. A key <b>step</b> in <b>valve</b> formation during heart development is the epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) of a subpopulation of endocardial cells in the atrioventricular cushion (AVC). The type III transforming growth factor-β receptor (TGFβR 3) regulates AVC endocardial cell EMT in vitro and mesenchymal cell differentiation in vivo. Little is known concerning the signaling mechanisms downstream of TGFβR 3. Here we use endocardial cell EMT in vitro to determine the role of 2 well-characterized downstream TGFβ signaling pathways in TGFβR 3 -dependent endocardial cell EMT. Targeting of Smad 4, the common mediator Smad, demonstrated that Smad signaling is required for EMT in the AVC and TGFβR 3 -dependent EMT stimulated by TGFβ 2 or BMP- 2. Although we show that Smads 1, 2, 3, and 5 are required for AVC EMT, overexpression of Smad 1 or Smad 3 is not sufficient to induce EMT. Consistent with the activation of the Par 6 /Smurf 1 pathway downstream of TGFβR 3, targeting ALK 5, Par 6, or Smurf 1 significantly inhibited EMT in response to either TGFβ 2 or BMP- 2. The requirement for ALK 5 activity, Par 6, and Smurf 1 for TGFβR 3 -dependent endocardial cell EMT is consistent with the documented role of this pathway in the dissolution of tight junctions. Taken together, our data demonstrate that TGFβR 3 -dependent endocardial cell EMT stimulated by either TGFβ 2 or BMP- 2 requires Smad 4 and the activation of the Par 6 /Smurf 1 pathway...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Detection of {{oscillation}} is {{a necessary}} <b>step</b> for determining <b>valve</b> stiction, which is a common problem in process industries. More speciﬁcally, many stiction detection methods assume persistency of the oscillation pattern in the control loop signals, which {{is a necessary}} condition to achieve reliable detection results. However, the existing oscillation detection methods do not study the persistency of the oscillation patterns directly. Instead, these methods try to discover the presence of speciﬁc periodic characteristics in the signals, their autocorrelation, or power-spectrum. This paper aims to propose an oscillation detection method that directly evaluates the similarity of the shapes of subsequent oscillation periods by means of correlation coeﬃcient. The proposed oscillation detection method is compared against ﬁve other methods reported in the literature. Furthermore, the stiction detection methods assuming oscillation in control loops have diﬀerent robustness to the disturbances corrupting the analyzed signals.

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this pilot study was to {{evaluate}} the feasibility and safety of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) without balloon pre-dilation. BackgroundBalloon pre-dilation of the stenosed aortic valve is currently {{believed to be a}} necessary <b>step</b> for <b>valve</b> preparation before device placement in patients undergoing TAVI and, therefore, is considered an obligatory part of the procedure. However, clear evidence supporting this policy is lacking. In contrast, pre-dilation might be responsible in part for distal embolizations as well as atrioventricular conduction disturbances seen during TAVI procedures. MethodsA total of 60 consecutive patients (mean age 80. 1 ± 6. 4 years, 53 % female, mean logistic EuroScore 23. 3 ± 15. 2 %) undergoing TAVI using the self-expanding Medtronic CoreValve prosthesis (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota) have been prospectively enrolled at 13 international centers. ResultsPre-procedural mean transaortic valve gradient was 47. 8 ± 15. 5 mm Hg, mean effective orifice area was 0. 67 ± 0. 15 cm 2. Technical success rate was 96. 7 % (58 of 60) of patients. Post-dilation was performed in 16. 7 % (10 of 60) of patients. Post-procedural mean valve gradient was 4. 4 ± 2. 0 mm Hg. Circular and noncircular valve configuration was present in 41 and 19 cases (68. 3 % vs. 31. 7 %), respectively, with similar effective orifice areas (1. 74 ± 0. 10 cm 2 vs. 1. 71 ± 0. 22 cm 2, p = NS).

40|$|Venous disease {{will affect}} 1 - 3 % {{of the western}} world {{at some point in their}} lives, yet there are few {{effective}} treatments for the venous system [1]. One such disease is chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a painful and debilitating illness that affects the superficial and deep vein valves of the legs. When the valves become incompetent they allow reflux and subsequent pooling of blood. Current clinical therapies are only moderately; and therefore, the need for a better solution remains. Prosthetic venous valves were constructed from a novel hydrogel biomaterial patented by Georgia Tech. The valves had flexible cusps similar to normal, anatomic venous valves. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the thrombotic potential of the GT venous valve in an in vitro study and to design a percutaneous delivery system. In vitro thrombosis model provides an appropriate intermediate <b>step</b> between <b>valve</b> development and in vivo analysis, which is necessary to determine the biocompatibility of the prosthetic device. The flow system was modified from a one-pass, flow-through thrombosis assay using whole blood [2] to mimic pulsatile physiologic conditions. Cessation of flow indicated thrombotic obstruction. Histological analysis was performed using H and E staining and Carstairs stain (specific for platelets). A group of valves were lined with Dacron to confirm the thrombotic potential of the system. All Dacron valves were occluded by thrombus connecting the polymer fibers with adherent platelets. Whole blood perfused through the GT prosthetic valves exhibited no thrombosis or platelet adherence. All GT valves were patent and competent after blood perfusion. H and E staining revealed no thrombus deposition on the GT vein valves. A percutaneous delivery system was designed after evaluating the GT valves for their compressibility and plastic deformation over time. Appropriate stents, catheters and sheaths were selected. As designed, this system will be utilized in an ovine trial of the valve. Due to the low in vitro thrombotic potential and strong history of PVA as a medical implant material, positive trial results are expected. With successful animal and human trials this valve can provide a potential intervention for the 7 million people suffering from CVI. M. S.

The study was performed on ovine mitral valves (n = 100). The decellularization of the whole mitral valve grafts was performed using 21 different detergent-based protocols. The effectiveness of the decellularization was investigated by immunofluorescent staining for DNA (as a marker of intracellular antigens) and α-GAL (as a marker of membrane-associated antigens), as well as DNA quantification. The mechanical properties and the repopulation potential were analyzed. The structure and repopulation rate analysis included hematoxylin-eosin, Movat’s pentachrome and Van Gieson histological staining, and immunofluorescent staining for collagen I and IV, as well as endothelial cell markers. Results. The protocols that included the gradual rise of the detergent solution were shown {{to be the most}} effective for the decellularization of the whole mitral valve graft. At the same time, the detergents alone failed to remove α-GAL. The reducing agent enhanced the decellularization, which resulted in complete removal of DNA and α-GAL, according to immunofluorescent staining.

However, it is still poorly understood how altered ACTC structure affects cardiovascular physiology and results in the development of distinct congenital disorders. A zebrafish mutant (s 434) was identified that demonstrates heart-specific defects, such as heart dilation and failure to generate ECs. We identified the mutation as a Y 169 S amino acid substitution, located within the W-loop of actin, which has been implicated in nucleotide sensing and proper actin polymerization. This mutation affects actin polymerization and stability of actin filaments and produces defects in heart function. Characterization of this mutant has led to the identification of a role for actc 1 a during zebrafish valvulogenesis, which is needed to produce proper shear stress at the AVC to form ECs. [...] Zebrafish hematopoietic cells formed in primitive hematopoiesis include erythrocytes, macrophages and neutrophils. The first myeloid cells to emerge in the zebrafish posterior lateral plate mesoderm (PLPM) are neutrophils, and the genetic pathways that direct differentiation of myeloid precursors into neutrophils are not well understood. Neutrophils are {{an important component of the}} innate immune systems in vertebrates and can be identified in zebrafish based on myeloperoxidase (mpx) gene expression. Ets- 1 related protein (Etsrp/Etv 2), an ETS-family transcription factor required for vascular development, has been shown to be important for myeloid cell development in the zebrafish. In this dissertation, we report findings of an investigation of Etv 2 's role during neutrophil development, and reveal an early cell-autonomous requirement for Etv 2 during primitive neutropoiesis. It was also found that Gata 1, an erythroid master regulator gene, is required for neutrophil formation during primitive hematopoiesis in the zebrafish. These roles for Etv 2 and Gata 1 during primitive hematopoiesis provide further insight into how progenitor cells make the fate decision to differentiate into neutrophils. [...] In summary, these results underscore the importance of the W-loop for actin functionality and will help us to understand structural and physiological consequences of ACTC mutations in human congenital disorders. The findings from the hematopoietic study help to expand our understanding of the intricate processes and genetic regulation guiding the process of hematopoiesis...|$|R
40|$|Heart valve {{diseases}} and blood vessel lesions are important causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. As {{one of the}} possible solutions, tissue engineering aims to create viable substitutes to face the well-known problems after implantation of prostheses and to present a solution for children. However, currently used tissue engineering paradigms, generally comprising of an in vitro maturation step, are associated with several problems, costs and risks. Therefore, our group oriented their efforts to the creation or recellularization of cardiovascular prostheses by using the patients body as its own bioreactor and more specifically by making use of the immature foreign body reaction (FBR) or parts thereof. Cellular dynamic studies showed a peak of primitive cells attracted after 3 days of implantation, which could differentiate into (myo) fibroblasts. Macrophages remained present during the different stages and so we further unraveled the role of macrophages during the early FBR in a {{first part of this}} thesis. From the gene expression, it was clear that monocytes and macrophages attracted by fibrinogen were first activated to perform a pure pro-inflammatory role and then switched to a more wound healing phenotype with added anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, the development of the early FBR could be altered by the application of cyclic stretching forces to the scaffold where the developing FBR took place. Forces induced a more than twofold increase in tissue strength and produced changes in extracellular matrix organization and some contractile protein expression. In previous experiments, we made use of a peritoneal implantation step to preseed the matrix with FBR cells. This supplemental implantation could be avoided by using homing factors detected within this system to attract relevant primitive FBR cells from the circulation. Some identified candidate homing molecules, amongst which stem cell factor (SCF) and stromal cell derived factor 1 alpha (SDF- 1 &# 945;) were used in coating experiments performed in a rat model of carotid artery implantation. This showed significantly higher attraction of primitive cells through fibronectin (FN) and SDF- 1 &# 945; coating compared with the uncoated controls. In a third part of this thesis, we found that both SDF- 1 &# 945;/CXCR- 4 and FN/&# 945; 4 -integrin-VCAM 1 axes were necessary during the early FBR, and could determine that these factors were important in the phase where the peak of stem cell attraction was seen. Consequently, the possibility to coat photo-oxidized bovine pericardium (POP) with FN and/or SDF- 1 &# 945; was shown. In a next <b>step,</b> POP <b>valves</b> were coated with FN, SDF- 1 &# 945; or the combination thereof, and subsequently implanted in sheep. Co-impregnation of the valves showed that the different types and relative proportion of valve interstitial cells approached those values observed in native valves. From this study, we could conclude that the combination of FN and SDF- 1 &# 945; had the most potential to be used inour recellularization paradigm. Wewere confident that our approach was not exclusively applicable to heart valves and could also be used in other cardiovascular applications, such as vessel replacement. So, the FN-SDF- 1 &# 945; coating was evaluated on small-caliber vascular grafts. Short-term implants again showed the effects of the coating on the attraction of primitive cells (CD 34 + and CD 117 +). This was associated with an improved endothelial coverage in parallel with a reduction in intimal hyperplasia and thrombosis on long-term. Eventually, we have evaluated the coating on decellularized homografts and compared them with homografts and decellularized homografts. Decellularization reduced calcification potential of homografts, while coating of decellularized homografts induced a reduction in regurgitation, the attraction and differentiation of appropriate valve interstitial cells and even collagen organization. In conclusion, the development of a useful technology to recellularize cardiovascular prostheses by coating them with the combination of FN and SDF- 1 &# 945; was shown. Its valuable improvements on acellular xenografts, small-caliber synthetic vascular grafts and decellularized homografts were proven. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Gasoline Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine has the {{potential}} of providing better fuel economy and emissions characteristics than current spark ignition engines. One implementation of this technology employs a Variable Valve Timing (VVT) system and is also often referred to as Controlled Auto Ignition (CAI) combustion in the literature. The objective of the study can be divided into two topics. First, the dynamic nature of load trajectory and several important phenomena in CAI mode were investigated. Second, the issues encountered during mode transition between SI and CAI regime were considered. Despite wide-open-throttle operation, pumping loss in CAI mode was not negligible. A major source of pumping loss in CAI mode was the heat transfer to cylinder wall during the recompression process due to the high in-cylinder residual gas temperature. The influence of fuel air equivalence ratio on combustion stability was analyzed to explain the misfires phenomenon in fuel rich condition during transient operation. Heat release analysis has been conducted to characterize the combustion process in CAI mode. Large variations of the 50 % burned point due to fluctuation of residual gas mass and temperature were observed. Small <b>step</b> changes in <b>valve</b> timings (EVC, EVO, and IVC) and fueling resulted in a new steady state within 3 - 4 engine cycles at 1500 rpm. These small step changes are reversible in nature. Sudden large step change in load required much longer time to reach steady state due to the time required for thermal stabilization. Misfires were observed in large low-load-to-high-load step change but not in high-load-to-low-load step change. (cont.) A simple open loop controller based on linear interpolation of fuel injection and valve timing events was implemented to assess the time scale required to avoid misfires during large load perturbation. Mode transition from the SI to CAI regime may be categorized as failed, non-robust, and robust. In a failed transition, the engine would not reach steady state CAI combustion. In a non-robust transition, one or more intended CAI cycles misfire, although the cycles progress to a satisfactory CAI operating after a few cycles. In robust transition, every intended CAI cycle is successful. A mode transition strategy based on late IVC and fuel metering strategy has been proposed. Smooth and robust modes transitions both from SI to CAI and vice versa have been experimentally demonstrated by implementing this strategy. by Halim G. Santoso. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} four different microfluidic technologies {{that can be used}} as stand-alone devices or integrated in point-of-care systems. The first technology is a rapid, low-cost, portable microfluidic system for assessing the somatic cell count and fat content of milk in 15 min using a “sample-in, answer-out” approach. The system consists of twelve independent microfluidic devices, essentially flattened funnel structures, fabricated on the footprint of a plastic compact disc (CD). The assay separates cells and fat globules based on their densities (by differential sedimentation), concentrating white cells in the closed-end channel near the outer rim of the CD for estimation of total “cell pellet” volume, while fat globules move toward the center of disc rotation, forming a fat “band” in the funnel. The closed-end channel provides accurate cell counts over the range 50, 000 to over 3, 000, 000 cells per mL. A technique is also presented to recirculate liquids in a microfluidic channel by alternating the predominance of centrifugal and capillary forces. With this technique, liquid volumes of μL to mL can be sampled with many sizes of microfluidic channels that contain {{only a fraction of the}} sample at one time, provided the channel wall with greatest surface area is hydrophilic. We present a theoretical model describing the balance of centrifugal and capillary forces in the device and validate the model experimentally. Towards the development of an integrated pathogen identification system, two other technologies are demonstrated and implemented. The design, fabrication, and characterization of a polymer centrifugal microfluidic system for the specific detection of bacterial pathogens is presented. This single-cartridge platform integrates bacteria capture and concentration, supernatant solution removal, lysis, and nucleic-acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) in a single unit. The unit is fabricated using multilayer lamination and consists of five different polymer layers. Bacteria capture and concentration are accomplished by sedimentation in five minutes. Centrifugation forces also drive the subsequent <b>steps.</b> A wax <b>valve</b> is integrated in the cartridge to enable high-speed centrifugation. Oil is used to prevent evaporation during reactions requiring thermal cycling. Device functionality was demonstrated by real-time detection of E. coli cells from a 200 -μL sample. Finally, the laser-printer-based fabrication of pressure-resistant microfluidic single-use valves is reported, along with their implementation on pressure-driven and centrifugal microfluidic platforms. A laser printer is used to selectively deposit toner on a plastic substrate in the form of circular dots. After assembly into a microfluidic device, the valve is opened (melted) with a pulse of laser light. This is an easy approach to connect multiple fluidic levels. This simple technology is compatible with a range of polymer microfabrication technologies and should facilitate the development of fully integrated, (re) configurable, and automated lab-on-a-chip systems, particularly when reagents must be stored on chip for extended periods, e. g. for medical diagnostic devices, lab-on-a-chip synthetic systems, or hazardous bio/chemical analysis platforms. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} described in this thesis was {{to contribute to the}} analytical and experimental development of a new hydraulic tunnel drilling robot which could be used to replace the present tedious, but highly skilled manual operations, which must be carried out in dusty, damp, noisy and often dangerous conditions. In this research, three separate but related investigations were carried out by the author to improve the precision and speed of positioning the hydraulic robot and to reduce its cost. The first investigation was the determination of the kinematics of a new positioning mechanism which has a tripod arrangement of hydraulic cylinders to improve the positioning stiffness of the robot manipulator. The second investigation was {{the development and implementation of}} an optimal tracking control algorithm to improve the precision of the manipulator tracking. The third investigation was the design of a tracking control hydraulic system using a low cost stepping motor driven proportional valve incorporating a pressure compensator to stabilize the flow gain of the valve and automatically compensate for the load disturbances. The design considerations, theoretical analysis, (including the derivation and solution of the inverse kinematics problem) and experimental testing which were related to these three investigations are presented in this thesis. A kinematics model of the drilling robot manipulator was first established by deriving the homogeneous transformation matrices for describing the relationship between the links of the robot manipulator and its work space. A combination of analytical and numerical methods were then used to solve the inverse kinematics problem of the drilling robot manipulator. A three dimensional simulation was then developed to verify the validity of the solution of the inverse kinematics problem. To implement an optimal tracking control algorithm, the dynamics of an experimental hydraulic robot were analyzed and a multiple input fifth order discrete state space model was established for the pitch control hydraulic system of the robot. An optimal tracking control algorithm was then derived and experimentally implemented to improve the tracking precision and positioning speed of the pitch control system of the hydraulic robot. The design of the controller was based on the dynamic model of the hydraulic robot and the optimal tracking control algorithm. A Kalman filter was designed for observing the state variables of the system. System identification was carried out using a triangle pulse input method that was developed to estimate the parameters of the tracking control system. This method was faster and caused less disturbance to the positioning mechanism than the sine wave and the random signal methods. It also had the advantage of being able to estimate the parameters of the system for both directions of motion of the actuator. A hydraulic circuit, which used a <b>stepping</b> motor driven <b>valve</b> incorporating a pressure compensator to stabilize the flow gain of the valve and which automatically compensated for the load disturbances, was designed and tested in the pitch optimal tracking control system. The comparison of this hydraulic circuit with one using a conventional proportional valve showed that the former improved the tracking performance significantly under large load disturbances and could successfully be used in the robot optimal tracking control system for tracking the given trajectories of displacement, velocity, and acceleration...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. Process {{industries}} today enjoy significant {{benefits from}} advances {{made in the}} field of simulation as well as technologies that model normal plant operation. Plants however continue to suffer during abnormal operation such as start-up, shutdown and equipment failures leading to production losses or personal injury. One of the key elements that determines the operational safety of any plant is the training and technical knowledge of its personnel regarding plant behaviour. Simulators {{play a vital role in}} training personnel, preparing them for normal plant operation, abnormal plant operation as well as emergency and accident situations. This would not only enhance plant safety, but also decrease total downtime. In order to create such a simulator, mathematical models are required for each of the numerous components within the plant. This dissertation focuses on the development of a mathematical model for a control valve; a component commonly found in various industries to control and manipulate processes. Different modelling methods are compared, taking into account applicable modelling criteria such as training data, algorithm complexity, oscillations near endpoints, degree of system integration and model limitations. Based on these criteria, fuzzy logic with the nearest neighbourhood clustering algorithm is chosen as an appropriate modelling technique especially due to its ability to deal with large quantities of data. In order to meaningfully train the fuzzy logic system (FLS), a comprehensive set of physical operational data is required, covering all the different operational characteristics. To capture physical data, the development of a data acquisition (DAQ) system is introduced using two common DAQ systems to create a hybrid solution. Transducer signals are converted tom mA to V, using custom developed signal conversion hardware. This will allow data to be sampled by a standard DAQ card and processed by accompanying software. Two post- processing software applications are created. The first application solves the governing equations (mass rate of flow, Reynolds number, expansibility factor and choke status) and the second application is used to graphically display the acquired and calculated data. A set of experiments are conducted, covering all relevant working areas, to capture the behaviour of the control valve. This is achieved using five initial pressures ranging from 200 kPa to 400 kPa in increments of 50 kPa. At each initial pressure a set of unit <b>step</b> responses with <b>valve</b> command signals ranging from 0 % to 100 % in increments of 5 % is acquired. 24 data files at each initial pressure set (200, 250, 300, 350 and 400 kPa) are acquired. Before training the FLS, the optimal fuzzy logic parameters need to be determined e. g. radius (r), sigma (σ) the number of time delays, the time delay increments and the impact of the input signals. Determining these parameters is an iterative process. Only a single data set, with initial pressure of 300 kPa, is used to derive the optimal fuzzy logic parameters. Four performance criteria namely maximum error average (MEA), mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of variation of the error residuals (CVRE) are used as benchmarks to obtain the optimal fuzzy parameters. During both the search for the optimal fuzzy parameters and the training of the fuzzy models using these optimal fuzzy parameters, 70 % of the data are used for training and verification while the remaining 30 % of the data are used for validation. Once the optimal fuzzy parameters are obtained using only the single data set, it is used to derive a number of fuzzy control valve models based on all the available data sets. All derived fuzzy models use the same parameters, except for a unique random file sequence associated with each of the models. The only prerequisite for the fuzzy models is that the generated file sequence be truly random. Irrespective of the random file sequence, fuzzy models with the same parameters, produce models with more or less the same performance. Therefore the performance criteria (MEA, MSE, RMSE and CVRE), for each data file, in the respective initial pressure sets, remains more or less the same. This method is found to be very useful in deriving a dynamic fuzzy logic control valve model. Averaging the performance criteria of these five models, an overall modelling accuracy of 90 % is achieved. It is recommended that a flow meter be installed to measure the mass rate of flow through the pipe network. This eliminates the need for an orifice, differential pressure transducer and the use of the first principle governing equation for the mass rate of flow. If a flow meter cannot be installed, a differential pressure transmitter with large range should be considered accompanied by a single orifice. Master...|$|R
