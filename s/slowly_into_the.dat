5|$|Hopes {{that the}} ballet {{would be ready}} in May were dashed and the opening night was {{postponed}} several times. Grisi was absent {{for a few days}} and her return was delayed to protect her health. Lighting, trapdoors, and scene changes needed further rehearsals. Cuts were made in Grisi's role to spare the dancer's health. Instead of returning to her tomb {{at the end of the}} ballet, it was decided that she would be placed on a bed of flowers and sink <b>slowly</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> earth. This touch preserved the romantic mood of the Act II finale.|$|E
5|$|Dry land is also {{important}} as it provides opportunities for basking, nesting, and escaping from temperature extremes. Gaping allows evaporation of moisture from the mouth lining and has a cooling effect, and several species make use of shallow burrows on land to keep cool. Wallowing in mud can also help prevent them from overheating. Four species of crocodilians climb trees to bask in areas lacking a shoreline. The type of vegetation bordering the rivers and lakes inhabited by crocodilians is mostly humid tropical forest, with mangrove swamps in estuarine areas. These forests are of great importance to the crocodilians, creating suitable microhabitats where they can flourish. The roots of the trees absorb water when it rains, releasing it back <b>slowly</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> environment. When the forests are cleared {{to make way for}} agriculture, rivers tend to silt up, the water runs off rapidly, the water courses can dry up in the dry season and flooding can occur in the wet season. Destruction of forest habitat is probably a greater threat to crocodilians than is hunting.|$|E
5|$|While {{the doctor}} {{talks with the}} police, Christiane, who has long been disenchanted with her father's experiments, and has been slowly losing her sanity from guilt and isolation, frees Paulette and stabs Louise in the neck. She also frees the dogs and doves that her father uses for experiments. Dr. Génessier dismisses the police (who readily accept his explanations) and returns to his lab, where an {{abandoned}} German Shepherd he'd only recently obtained for his experiments attacks him, inciting the other dogs to follow suit—maddened by pain and confinement, they maul him to death, disfiguring {{his face in the}} process. Christiane, unmoved by her father's death, walks <b>slowly</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> woods outside Génessier's house with one of the freed doves on her hand.|$|E

5|$|Bräck {{closed the}} gap with de Ferran over the next fifteen laps as they moved towards slower cars. Bräck got a run on de Ferran and overtook him {{at the bottom of}} the first turn to take over the lead on lap 46, while Andretti lost fourth place to Franchitti on the same lap. Jourdain spun leaving turn four because of his car {{generating}} oversteer, and slid down the frontstretch triggering the second caution on the 50th lap. Franchitti drove to the outside of the track in avoidance. Castroneves avoided hitting Jourdain's car, which remained {{at the bottom of the}} first turn and, though his vehicle lost one of its shock covers, he regained control of his car and continued. Fittipaldi reported to his team that he had a problem with either his gearbox or drivetrain and drove <b>slowly</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pit lane on lap 53 becoming the race's second retirement. The leaders elected to make pit stops on the same lap under caution. Da Matta gained the most positions, moving from sixth to third, and Bräck remained the leader at the lap-57 restart. Bräck pulled away from the rest of the field, until de Ferran {{closed the gap}} between them by the start of the 80th lap.|$|E

25|$|Offshore soil {{collection}} introduces many difficult variables. In shallow water, {{work can}} be done off a barge. In deeper water a ship will be required. Deepwater soil samplers are normally variants of Kullenberg-type samplers, a modification on a basic gravity corer using a piston (Lunne and Long, 2006). Seabed samplers are also available, which push the collection tube <b>slowly</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> soil.|$|E

25|$|Sulfuric acid at high {{concentrations}} is frequently the major ingredient in acidic drain cleaners {{which are used}} to remove grease, hair, tissue paper, etc. Similar to their alkaline versions, such drain openers can dissolve fats and proteins via hydrolysis. Moreover, as concentrated sulfuric acid has a strong dehydrating property, it can remove tissue paper via dehydrating process as well. Since the acid may react with water vigorously, such acidic drain openers should be added <b>slowly</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pipe to be cleaned.|$|E
25|$|Superficial ICD (also {{known as}} Steady State Isobaric Counterdiffusion) {{occurs when the}} inert gas breathed by the diver diffuses more <b>slowly</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> body than the inert gas {{surrounding}} the body. An example {{of this would be}} breathing air in an heliox environment. The helium in the heliox diffuses into the skin quickly, while the nitrogen diffuses more slowly from the capillaries to the skin and out of the body. The resulting effect generates supersaturation in certain sites of the superficial tissues and the formation of inert gas bubbles.|$|E
25|$|In 1829 the Swan River Colony was {{established}} on the Swan River by Captain James Stirling. By 1832, the British settler {{population of the}} colony had reached around 1,500, and the official name of the colony was changed to Western Australia. The two separate townsites of the colony developed <b>slowly</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> port city of Fremantle and the state's capital, Perth. York was the first inland settlement in Western Australia, situated 97 kilometres east of Perth and settled on 16 September 1831. York was the staging point for early explorers who discovered the rich gold reserves of Kalgoorlie.|$|E

25|$|At the Battle of Five Forks on April 1, 1865, Sheridan judged {{that the}} V Corps had moved too <b>slowly</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> attack, and criticised Warren {{fiercely}} {{for not being}} {{at the front of}} his columns. Warren had been held up, searching for Samuel W. Crawford’s division, which had gone astray in the woods. But overall, he had handled his corps efficiently, and their attack had carried the day at Five Forks, arguably the pivotal battle of the final days. Nevertheless, Sheridan relieved Warren of command on the spot. He was assigned to the defenses of Petersburg and then briefly to command of the Department of Mississippi.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{flush toilet}} is a vitreous, ceramic bowl {{containing}} water, plus plumbing to rapidly {{fill it with}} more water. The water in the toilet bowl is connected to a hollow drain pipe shaped like an upside-down U connecting the drain. One side of the U channel is arranged as a hollow siphon tube longer than {{the water in the}} bowl is high. The siphon tube connects to the drain. The top of the upside-down U-shaped drain pipe limits the height of the water in the bowl before it flows down the drain. If water is poured <b>slowly</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bowl it simply flows over the rim of the upside-down U and pours slowly down the drain—thus the toilet does not flush. The standing water in the bowl acts as a barrier to sewer gas coming out of the sewer through the drain, and also as a receptacle for waste. Sewer gas is vented through a separate vent pipe attached to the sewer line.|$|E
25|$|The {{drip line}} or trickle acclimating method {{is a safe}} and gentle way to {{introduce}} saltwater fish into a new home, and is a fairly simple one to perform. This procedure {{can be used to}} acclimate all types of marine as well as freshwater livestock. First, the fish is placed with all the bag water in a bucket or container of sufficient size for the fish to be reasonably covered with the water, and the bucket is then set {{on the floor next to}} the aquarium. Using some plastic air line tubing and an air gang valve, a siphon drip line is set up from the aquarium to the bucket. Tank water is allowed to drip <b>slowly</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bucket, using the gang valve to adjust the drip rate, until the water dripped into the bucket equals about two to three times the original volume of the bag water. After testing the pH, salinity, and temperature of the water in the bucket to see if these parameters match that of the tank water, the fish is gently removed and placed into the tank.|$|E

25|$|Bottas {{entered the}} pit lane on lap eleven with Vettel, Alonso and Ricciardo doing {{likewise}} {{on the next}} lap. After Kvyat made his stop, he rejoined behind Rosberg but overtook him shortly after. Hamilton made his pit stop from the lead on lap 14, and emerged back in first, narrowly ahead of Button. Rosberg was informed over the radio {{that he could not}} go beyond 6,500 revolutions per minute in first gear because his pit lane limiter was faulty. He drove <b>slowly</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> pit lane on lap 14 and purposely stalled his car as his tyres and steering wheel were changed. Mechanics switched his car off and Rosberg selected multiple buttons on his steering wheel in an attempt to change gear. After being stationary for nearly two minutes, Rosberg's car was pushed back into his garage and retired. Massa overtook Pérez for sixth place on the 15th lap, and Vergne was handed a five-second stop-and-go penalty on the next lap after being judged to have exceeded track limits. Gutiérrez drove into his garage to retire with an engine electrical problem on lap 19. Chilton was forced into making an unscheduled pit stop two laps later after his front-right tyre was punctured because of a valve problem on the wheel.|$|E
25|$|Christianity spread <b>slowly</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Aare valley. The dioceses of Lausanne, Basel, Sion, Chur and Constance {{were all}} {{established}} {{before the new}} faith made inroads into the valley. The Aare valley was bordered by three dioceses; Lausanne, Constance and Basel. However, the first Christian missionaries came into the valley from Alsace and other western areas. In 630 the Abbey of Luxeuil established the Abbey of Moutier-Grandval along the old transit route through the Pierre Pertuis Pass. By the 9th or 10th Century, this Abbey had property and influence {{all the way to}} Lake Biel and into the Balsthal valley. The first monastic cells of what would become the Abbey of Saint-Imier was also founded in 600. In the Seeland and Aare valleys, wooden churches were first built during the Merovingian period. The current churches in Kirchlindach, Oberwil bei Buren and Bleibach were all built above the ruins of these early churches. About 30 churches in the Bern and Solothurn portions of the Aare valley were created over ruins of Roman villas and subsequent burial grounds in the 7th Century (including Meikirch and Oberbipp). In Mett, the church was built over a 5th-century mausoleum, which was built over a 4th-century tomb. In 700, six sarcophagi were buried on St. Peter's Island next to a Roman temple complex. A wooden monastery was built over the complex in the 8th–9th century.|$|E

NRA and PWA reported to different cabinet agencies, making coordination difficult, and PWA money flowed so <b>slowly</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> economy that NRA proved to be the more important agency by far.|$|E
