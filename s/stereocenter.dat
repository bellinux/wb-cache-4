25|$|Alpha-carbon (α-carbon) {{is also a}} {{term that}} applies to {{proteins}} and amino acids. It is the backbone carbon before the carbonyl carbon. Therefore, reading along the backbone of a typical protein would give a sequence of –n– etc. (when reading in the N to C direction). The α-carbon is where the different substituents attach to each different amino acid. That is, the groups hanging off the chain at the α-carbon are what give amino acids their diversity. These groups give the α-carbon its stereogenic properties for every amino acid except for glycine. Therefore, the α-carbon is a <b>stereocenter</b> for every amino acid except glycine. Glycine also {{does not have a}} β-carbon, while every other amino acid does.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} <b>stereocenters</b> in alpha-tocopherol, {{so this is}} a chiral molecule.

These stereoisomers can also be named in an alternative older nomenclature, where the <b>stereocenters</b> are either in the d or l form.|$|R

25|$|The first {{synthesis}} of atorvastatin at Parke-Davis {{that occurred during}} drug discovery was racemic followed by chiral chromatographic separation of the enantiomers. An early enantioselective route to atorvastatin made use of an ester chiral auxiliary to set the stereochemistry {{of the first of}} the two alcohol functional groups via a diastereoselective aldol reaction. Once the compound entered pre-clinical development, process chemistry developed a cost-effective and scalable synthesis. In atorvastatin's case, a key element of the overall synthesis was ensuring stereochemical purity in the final drug substance, and hence establishing the first <b>stereocenter</b> became a key aspect of the overall design. The final commercial production of atorvastatin relied on a chiral pool approach, where the stereochemistry of the first alcohol functional group was carried into the synthesis—through the choice of isoascorbic acid, an inexpensive and easily sourced plant-derived natural product.|$|E
