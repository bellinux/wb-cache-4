5|$|Scientists have {{suggested}} that the unique skull shape of Majungasaurus and other abelisaurids indicate different predatory habits than other theropods. Whereas most theropods were characterized by long, low skulls of narrow width, abelisaurid skulls were taller and wider, and often shorter in length as well. The narrow skulls of other theropods were well equipped to withstand the vertical stress of a powerful bite, but not as good at withstanding torsion (twisting). In comparison to modern mammalian predators, most theropods may have used a strategy <b>similar</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> to that of long- and narrow-snouted canids, with the delivery of many bites weakening the prey animal.|$|E

5|$|One {{special case}} of Maldacena's {{proposal}} says that N=4 super Yang–Mills theory, a gauge theory <b>similar</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> to quantum chromodynamics, {{is equivalent to}} string theory in five-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. This result helped clarify the earlier work of 't Hooft {{on the relationship between}} string theory and quantum chromodynamics, taking string theory back to its roots as a theory of nuclear physics. Maldacena's results also provided a concrete realization of the holographic principle with important implications for quantum gravity and black hole physics. By the year 2015, Maldacena's paper had become the most highly cited paper in high energy physics with over 10,000 citations. These subsequent articles have provided considerable evidence that the correspondence is correct, although so far it has not been rigorously proved.|$|E
5|$|The female is <b>similar</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> to the male, but paler and duller.

The head of the females of the subspecies ammodendri and nigricans is dingy grey with darker smudges on the forehead, behind its eyes, and on its throat. The female of the subspecies stoliczkae is buff-brown with a white throat, a conspicuous pale supercilium, darker forehead, and lighter cheeks. The juvenile is similar to the female, differing in its lack of dark tinges on its throat and crown. In adults, moulting begins in July and ends in late August or early September. The post-juvenile moult is complete, and occurs variously from June to August.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Clustering is {{the most}} {{important}} unsupervised learning technique of organizing objects into groups whose members are <b>similar</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>way.</b> Partitional clustering algorithms obtain a single partition of the data instead of a clustering structure. K-mean clustering is a common approach; however one of its drawbacks is the selection of initial centroid points randomly because of which algorithm has to re-iterate number of times. This paper first studies existing methods for selecting the number of clusters and initial centroid points, and also proposes a new method for selecting the initial centroid points and the modified K-mean algorithm which will reduce the number of iterations and improves the lapse time...|$|R

25|$|In Southland, the Model T Ford railcars were {{assigned}} to the Waikaia and the Wyndham (Glenham) branches and began operating in late May 1926. These two lines were <b>similar</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>ways</b> to the Greytown Branch; although they did not have multiple shuttle services to connect with mainline trains, they served small towns with insufficient demand for locomotive-hauled carriage passenger trains. Previously, the two lines had been served by mixed trains that carried both passengers and freight, and as they had to load and unload freight along the way, trip times were slow and thus unpopular. It was hoped the Model T Ford railcars would rejuvenate traffic and provide some measure of profitability, especially on the section of the Wyndham Branch from Wyndham to Glenham, which was so underutilised that it was facing closure.|$|E

All is so artfully unified that [...] "that part which is only the fantastic creation of his mind, has the same palpable texture, and coheres 'semblably' with the rest." ...|$|E
