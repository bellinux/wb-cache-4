50|$|<b>Statistical</b> <b>time-division</b> <b>multiplexing</b> (STDM) is an {{advanced}} version of TDM {{in which both}} {{the address of the}} terminal and the data itself are transmitted together for better routing.

50|$|In {{its primary}} form, TDM {{is used for}} circuit mode {{communication}} with a fixed number of channels and constant bandwidth per channel.

40|$|Abstract—Embedded {{systems in}} field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) can be {{customized}} and adaptive if assembled from modular components at run time. This paper examines realizing run-time system assembly by extension of platform-based design. Two major challenges are {{addressed in this}} paper. First, {{the design of a}} reconfigurable platform architecture suitable for run-time system assembly is described. Different systems are constructed by integrating the platform architecture with different modular components, which employ the communication infrastructure supplied by the platform in order to interact. Second, where on-chip communications channels use shared media, we propose techniques for modeling the intermodule communication behavior based on <b>statistical</b> <b>time-division</b> <b>multiplexing.</b> The proposed techniques enable system designers to guarantee that logical communication requirements between the adjunct modules can be satisfied by the infrastructure. An in-depth analysis is presented and then verified with cycle-accurate simulations for an example reconfigurable platform for real-time video applications.

40|$|This paper proposes and evaluates {{two related}} fast packet {{switching}} architectures based on <b>time-division</b> <b>multiplexed</b> integrated photonic fabrics. The architectures are targeted towards low-latency inter-node switching and intra-node routing in high-speed networks.

Buffer behavior is analyzed at both input and output stages {{to determine the effect}} of varying the switching bandwidth on the performance metrics (delay, throughput and packet loss probability). The dependency of a finite output buffer latency and overflow probability on the normalized switching bandwidth, in a switch with output queueing, is first analyzed in this paper. The intra-node trunk traffic router consists of a passive optical coupler followed by an active routing stage.
