60|$|I now {{extended}} {{the supervision of}} my grounds. I walked through the woods, and saw how beautiful {{they were in the}} early dawn. I threw aside the fallen twigs and cut away encroaching saplings, which were beginning to encumber the paths I had made, and if I found a bough which hung too low I cut it off. There was a great beech-tree, between which and a dogwood I had the year before suspended a hammock. In passing this, one morning, I was amazed to see a hammock swinging from the hooks I had put in the two trees. This was a retreat which I had supposed no one else would fancy or even think of! In the hammock was a fan--a common Japanese fan. For fifteen minutes I stood looking at that hammock, every nerve a-tingle. Then I glanced around. The spot had been almost unfrequented <b>since</b> <b>last</b> <b>summer.</b> Little bushes, weeds, and vines had sprung up here and there between the two trees. There were dead twigs and limbs lying about, and the short path to the main walk was much overgrown.|$|E

If he goes on qualis ab incepto, I know few men who will deserve more praise or obtain it. I must go and see him again;--the rapid succession of adventure, <b>since</b> <b>last</b> <b>summer,</b> added to some serious uneasiness and business, have interrupted our acquaintance; but he is a man worth knowing; and though, for his own sake, I wish him out of prison, I like to study character in such situations. He has been unshaken, and will continue so. I don't think him deeply versed in life;--he is the bigot of virtue (not religion), and enamoured of the beauty of that [...] "empty name," [...] as the last breath of Brutus pronounced [1], and every day proves it. He is, perhaps, a little opinionated, as all men who are the centre of circles, wide or narrow--the Sir Oracles, in whose name two or three are gathered together--must be, and as even Johnson was; but, withal, a valuable man, and less vain than success and even the consciousness of preferring [...] "the right to the expedient" [...] might excuse.|$|E
