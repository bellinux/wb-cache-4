5|$|Haldane's {{hypothesis}} {{was that a}} diver could ascend immediately to a depth where the <b>supersaturation</b> reaches but does not exceed the critical <b>supersaturation</b> level, at which depth the pressure gradient for off-gassing is maximized and the decompression is most efficient. The diver would remain at this depth until saturation had reduced sufficiently for him to ascend another 10 feet, to the new depth of critical <b>supersaturation,</b> where the process would be repeated until it was safe for the diver to reach the surface. Haldane assumed a constant critical ratio of dissolved nitrogen pressure to ambient pressure which was invariant with depth.|$|E
5|$|Submarine escape {{training}} led US Navy {{personnel to}} believe that Haldane's allowable <b>supersaturation</b> ratios for fast tissues were unnecessarily conservative, as calculated values indicated that <b>supersaturation</b> in trainees exceeded Haldane's limits, {{but they did not}} develop DCS. A large number (2143) of experimental dives were conducted over 3 years to derive allowable <b>supersaturation</b> ratios for a Haldanian 5 compartment model with compartment half-times of 5, 10, 20, 40 and 70 minutes. Values for critical <b>supersaturation</b> derived from this experimental work were different for each tissue compartment. Values for slow tissues (75 and 40-minute) were close to Haldane's findings, but considerably higher values were found for the fast tissues. These values were so high that the researchers concluded that the 5- and 10-minute tissues were not relevant to the development of DCS. Based on these conclusions, a set of tables was computed which omitted the 5- and 10-minute tissues.|$|E

40|$|In situ {{measurements}} of water vapor concentration {{made during the}} CRYSTAL-FACE and Pre-AVE missions indicate higher than expected <b>supersaturations</b> in both clear and cloudy air near the cold tropical tropopause: (1) steady-state ice <b>supersaturations</b> of 20 - 30 % were measured within cirrus at T < 200 K; (2) <b>supersaturations</b> exceeding 100 % (near water saturation) were observed under cloud-free conditions near 187 K. The in-cloud measurements challenge the conventional belief that any water vapor in excess of ice saturation should be depleted by crystal growth given sufficient time. The high clear-sky <b>supersaturations</b> imply that thresholds for ice nucleation due to homogeneous freezing of aerosols (or any other mechanism) are much higher than those inferred from laboratory measurements.

40|$|Organic {{compounds}} with surfactant {{properties are}} {{commonly found in}} atmospheric aerosol particles. Surface activity can significantly influence the cloud droplet forming ability of these particles. We have studied the cloud droplet formation by two-component particles comprising one of the organic surfactants sodium octanoate, sodium decanoate, sodium dodecanoate, and sodium dodecyl sulfate, mixed with sodium chloride. Critical <b>supersaturations</b> were measured with a static diffusion cloud condensation nucleus counter (Wyoming CCNC- 100 B). Results were modeled from Köhler theory applying three different representations of surfactant properties in terms of surfactant surface partitioning and reduced droplet surface tension. We here confirm previous results for single-component organic surfactant particles, that experimental critical <b>supersaturations</b> are greatly underpredicted, if reduced surface tension is used while ignoring the effects of surface partitioning in droplets. Furthermore, disregarding surfactant properties by ignoring surface partitioning and assuming the constant surface tension of pure water {{can also lead to}} significant underpredictions of experimental critical <b>supersaturations.</b> For the mixed particles comprising less than 50 % by mass of surfactant, this approach however still provides a good description of the observed droplet activation.

Treating our simulations as computer experiments, we compare our simulation results with those based on the Zener–Frank and Laraia–Johnson–Voorhees theories {{for the growth of}} non-misfitting and misfitting precipitates, respectively. The agreement between simulations and the Zener–Frank theory is very good in one-dimensional systems. In two-dimensional systems with interfacial curvature (with and without misfit), we find good agreement between theory and simulations, but only at large <b>supersaturations,</b> where we find that the Gibbs–Thomson effect is less completely realized. At small <b>supersaturations,</b> the convergence of instantaneous growth coefficient in simulations towards its theoretical value could not be tracked to completion, because the diffusional field reached the system boundary.

5|$|Early {{decompression}} theory generally {{assumed that}} inert gas bubble {{formation in the}} tissues could be avoided during decompression, and {{the aim of the}} decompression tables and algorithms was to prevent bubble formation while minimising decompression time.

5|$|US Navy {{decompression}} tables {{have gone}} {{through a lot of}} development over the years. They have mostly been based on parallel multi-compartment exponential models. The number of compartments has varied, and the allowable <b>supersaturation</b> in the various compartments during ascent has undergone major development based on experimental work and records of decompression sickness incidents.|$|E
5|$|The ascent is an {{important}} part of the process of decompression, as this is the time when reduction of ambient pressure occurs, and it is of critical importance to safe decompression that the ascent rate is compatible with safe elimination of inert gas from the diver's tissues. Ascent rate must be limited to prevent <b>supersaturation</b> of tissues to the extent that unacceptable bubble development occurs. This is usually done by specifying a maximum ascent rate compatible with the decompression model chosen. This will be specified in the decompression tables or the user manual for the decompression software or personal decompression computer. The instructions will usually include contingency procedures for deviation from the specified rate, both for delays and exceeding the recommended rate. Failure to comply with these specifications will generally increase the risk of decompression sickness.|$|E
5|$|The ice {{crystals}} in cirrus clouds have different shapes {{in addition to}} different sizes.

In the northern Arctic region, cirrus tend to be composed of only the columns, plates, and conglomerations, and these crystals tend to be at least four times larger than the minimum size. In Antarctica, cirrus are usually composed of only the columns, and these columns are much longer than normal.|$|E

These fatty acid sodium salts are surface active molecules which {{have all been}} identified in atmospheric aerosol particles. Experimental critical <b>supersaturations</b> increased systematically with increasing carbon chain length and were in the range 0. 96 - 1. 34 % for particles with a dry diameter of 40 nm. The experimental data were modeled using Köhler theory modified to account for partitioning of the surface active fatty acid sodium salts between the droplet bulk and surface as well as Köhler theory including surface tension reduction without accounting for surfactant partitioning.

40|$|Upper tropospheric {{observations}} {{outside and}} inside of cirrus clouds indicate water vapour mixing ratios sometimes exceeding water saturation. Relative humidities over ice (RH ice) {{of up to}} and more than 200 % have been reported from aircraft and balloon measurements in recent years. From these observations a lively discussion continues on {{whether there is a}} lack of understanding of ice cloud microphysics or whether the water measurements are tainted with large uncertainties or flaws. Here, RH ice in clear air and in ice clouds is investigated. Strict quality-checked aircraft in situ observations of RH ice were performed during 28 flights in tropical, mid-latitude and Arctic field experiments in the temperature range 183 – 240 K. In our field measurements, no <b>supersaturations</b> above water saturation are found. Nevertheless, super- or subsaturations inside of cirrus are frequently observed at low temperatures (< 205 K) in our field data set. To explain persistent RH ice deviating from saturation, we analysed the number densities of ice crystals recorded during 20 flights. From the combined analysis – using conventional microphysics – of <b>supersaturations</b> and ice crystal numbers, we show that the high, persistent <b>supersaturations</b> observed inside of cirrus can possibly be explained by unexpected, frequent very low ice crystal numbers that could scarcely be caused by homogeneous ice nucleation. Heterogeneous ice formation or the suppression of freezing might better explain the observed ice crystal numbers. Thus, our lack of understanding of the high <b>supersaturations,</b> with implications for the microphysical and radiative properties of cirrus, the vertical redistribution of water and climate, is traced back to the understanding of the freezing process at low temperatures...|$|R

5|$|Uric acid has {{the highest}} {{concentration}} of any blood antioxidant and provides {{over half of the}} total antioxidant capacity of human serum. Uric acid's antioxidant activities are also complex, given that it does not react with some oxidants, such as superoxide, but does act against peroxynitrite, peroxides, and hypochlorous acid. Concerns over elevated UA's contribution to gout must be considered as one of many risk factors. By itself, UA-related risk of gout at high levels (415–530 μmol/L) is only 0.5% per year with an increase to 4.5% per year at UA <b>supersaturation</b> levels (535+ μmol/L).

5|$|Decompression may be {{continuous}} or staged, {{where the}} ascent {{is interrupted by}} stops at regular depth intervals, but the entire ascent {{is part of the}} decompression, and ascent rate can be critical to harmless elimination of inert gas. What is commonly known as no-decompression diving, or more accurately no-stop decompression, relies on limiting ascent rate for avoidance of excessive bubble formation. Staged decompression may include deep stops depending on the theoretical model used for calculating the ascent schedule. Omission of decompression theoretically required for a dive profile exposes the diver to significantly higher risk of symptomatic decompression sickness, and in severe cases, serious injury or death. The risk is related to the severity of exposure and the level of <b>supersaturation</b> of tissues in the diver. Procedures for emergency management of omitted decompression and symptomatic decompression sickness have been published.
