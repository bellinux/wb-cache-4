5|$|Many {{animals have}} a <b>specific</b> <b>temperature</b> range {{where they are}} active, meaning the times they are active vary with the seasons. Snakes and lizards {{hibernate}} during the winter months, are diurnal during the late spring and early fall, and become crepuscular during the heat of summer. Many insects and some birds also alter their times of activity. Some animals, like ground squirrels and marmots, have one or more periods of estivation, a summer hibernation {{that allows them to}} avoid the hottest and driest periods.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{points out}} that all changes of form are {{phenomena}} of growth. He analyses growth curves for man, noting rapid growth before birth {{and again in the}} teens; and then curves for other animals. In plants, growth is often in pulses, as in Spirogyra, peaks at a <b>specific</b> <b>temperature,</b> and below that value roughly doubles every 10 degrees Celsius. Tree growth varies cyclically with season (less strongly in evergreens), preserving a record of historic climates. Tadpole tails regenerate rapidly at first, slowing exponentially.|$|E
5|$|In some instances, the {{production}} of analogue pizza cheese can be similar to {{the production}} of cream cheese, although production may be different and homogenization may be avoided. In some varieties, the product is heated to remain at a <b>specific</b> <b>temperature</b> and for a specific amount of time, which causes the proteins in the mix to gelatinize. During this process, salts in the mix serve to emulsify it and thus improve the meltability of the final product. The heated product is then placed in packaging such as bags-in-boxes while still hot, as it is more easily handled in this state compared to when in a solid state. During packaging, these types of pizza cheeses are then quick-cooled to avoid browning of the product, which can occur vis-a-vis the Maillard reaction.|$|E

5|$|A 2004 {{study by}} Kathryn Thomas and Sandra Carlson used teeth {{from the upper}} jaw of three {{individuals}} interpreted as a juvenile, a subadult, and an adult, recovered from a bone bed in the Hell Creek Formation of Corson County, South Dakota. In this study, successive teeth in columns in the edmontosaurs' dental batteries were sampled from multiple locations along each tooth using a microdrilling system. This sampling method {{takes advantage of the}} organization of hadrosaurid dental batteries to find variation in tooth isotopes over a period of time. From their work, it appears that edmontosaur teeth took less than about 0.65years to form, slightly faster in younger edmontosaurs. The teeth of all three individuals appeared to show variation in oxygen isotope ratios that could correspond to warm/dry and cool/wet periods; Thomas and Carlson considered the possibility that the animals were migrating instead, but favored local seasonal variations because migration would have more likely led to ratio homogenization, as many animals migrate to stay within <b>specific</b> <b>temperature</b> ranges or near particular food sources.|$|E
25|$|A time-independent {{perturbation}} in thermal EMF in <b>specific</b> <b>temperature</b> ranges. This {{is due to}} composition-dependent magnetic transformations that perturb {{the thermal}} EMFs in type-K thermocouples in the range about 25–225°C, and in type J above 730°C.|$|E
25|$|Fugacity {{coefficients}} are dimensionless and can {{be obtained}} experimentally at <b>specific</b> <b>temperature</b> and pressure, from measurements of deviations from ideal gas behaviour.

50|$|For {{crystals}} operated at series resonance or {{pulled away}} from the main mode by the inclusion of a series inductor or capacitor, significant (and temperature-dependent) spurious responses may be experienced. Though most spurious modes are typically some tens of kilohertz above the wanted series resonance their temperature coefficient is different from the main mode and the spurious response may move through the main mode at certain temperatures. Even if the series resistances at the spurious resonances appear higher than the one at wanted frequency a rapid change in the main mode series resistance can occur at <b>specific</b> <b>temperatures</b> when the two frequencies are coincidental.A consequence of these activity dips is that the oscillator may lock at a spurious frequency at <b>specific</b> <b>temperatures.</b> This is generally minimized by ensuring that the maintaining circuit has insufficient gain to activate unwanted modes.|$|R
25|$|Klister: {{a sticky}} ointment, which may contain a {{combination}} of rosins, waxes, solvents and fats—with the formulation tailored for snow that comprises coarse crystals, having been transformed through freeze-thaw or being wind-blown, and adjusted for <b>specific</b> <b>temperature</b> ranges. Spray-on klister is more convenient than klister applied from a tube. An incorrect match of klister to snow conditions can also cause icing.|$|E
25|$|Changes in {{luminosity}} {{are common}} to all stars, but the severity of such fluctuations covers a broad range. Most stars are relatively stable, but a significant minority of variable stars often undergo sudden and intense increases in luminosity and consequently {{in the amount of}} energy radiated toward bodies in orbit. These stars are considered poor candidates for hosting life-bearing planets, as their unpredictability and energy output changes would negatively impact organisms: living things adapted to a <b>specific</b> <b>temperature</b> range could not survive too great a temperature variation. Further, upswings in luminosity are generally accompanied by massive doses of gamma ray and X-ray radiation which might prove lethal. Atmospheres do mitigate such effects, but their atmosphere might not be retained by planets orbiting variables, because the high-frequency energy buffeting these planets would continually strip them of their protective covering.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} glide waxes are {{tailored}} for <b>specific</b> <b>temperature</b> ranges and other snow properties with varying wax hardness and other properties that address repellence of moisture and dirt. The hardness of the glide wax affects the melting {{of the snow}} to lubricate its passage over the surface {{and its ability to}} avoid suction from meltwater in the snow. Too little melting and sharp edges of snow crystals or too much suction impede the passage of the ski. A tipping point between where crystal type dominates sliding friction and moisture content dominates occurs around 26°F. Harder waxes address colder, drier or more abrasive snow conditions, whereas softer waxes have a lower coefficient of friction, but abrade more readily. Wax formulations combine three types of wax to adjust coefficient of friction and durability. From hard to soft, they include synthetic waxes with 50 or more carbon atoms, microcrystalline waxes with 25 to 50 carbon atoms and paraffin waxes with 20 to 35 carbon atoms. Additives to such waxes include graphite, teflon, silicon, fluorocarbons, and molybdenum to improve glide and/or reduce dirt accumulation.|$|E

500|$|The {{most common}} oxide of {{vanadium}}, vanadium pentoxide V2O5, {{is used as}} a catalyst in manufacturing sulfuric acid by the contact process and as an oxidizer in maleic anhydride production. Vanadium pentoxide is used in ceramics. [...] Vanadium is an important component of mixed metal oxide catalysts used in the oxidation of propane and propylene to acrolein, acrylic acid or the ammoxidation of propylene to acrylonitrile. In service, the oxidation state of vanadium changes dynamically and reversibly with the oxygen and the steam content of the reacting feed mixture. [...] Another oxide of vanadium, vanadium dioxide VO2, is used in the production of glass coatings, which blocks infrared radiation (and not visible light) at a <b>specific</b> <b>temperature.</b> Vanadium oxide can be used to induce color centers in corundum to create simulated alexandrite jewelry, although alexandrite in nature is a chrysoberyl.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} entropy can be {{described}} qualitatively {{as a measure of}} energy dispersal at a <b>specific</b> <b>temperature.</b> Similar terms have been in use from early in the history of classical thermodynamics, and with the development of statistical thermodynamics and quantum theory, entropy changes have been described in terms of the mixing or [...] "spreading" [...] of the total energy of each constituent of a system over its particular quantized energy levels.|$|E

50|$|Water {{droplets}} commonly {{remain as}} liquid water {{and do not}} freeze, even well below 0 C. Ice nuclei that may be present in an atmospheric droplet become active for ice formation at <b>specific</b> <b>temperatures</b> in between 0 C and -38 C, depending on nucleus geometry and composition. Without ice nuclei, supercooled water droplets (as well as any extremely pure liquid water) can exist down to about -38 C, at which point spontaneous freezing occurs.|$|R

2500|$|An {{equation}} of state (for gases) is a mathematical model used to roughly describe or predict the state properties of a gas. At present, {{there is no single}} {{equation of}} state that accurately predicts the properties of all gases under all conditions. Therefore, a number of much more accurate equations of state have been developed for gases in <b>specific</b> <b>temperature</b> and pressure ranges. The [...] "gas models" [...] that are most widely discussed are [...] "perfect gas", [...] "ideal gas" [...] and [...] "real gas". Each of these models has its own set of assumptions to facilitate the analysis of a given thermodynamic system.

2500|$|Intensive piggeries are {{generally}} large warehouse-like buildings or barns. [...] Indoor pig systems allow the pigs' conditions to be monitored, ensuring minimum fatalities and increased productivity. Buildings are ventilated and their temperature regulated. [...] Most domestic pig varieties {{are susceptible to}} sunburn and heat stress, and all pigs lack sweat glands and cannot cool themselves. Pigs have a limited tolerance to high temperatures and heat stress can lead to death. [...] Maintaining a more <b>specific</b> <b>temperature</b> within the pig-tolerance range also maximizes growth and growth-to-feed ratio. [...] Indoor piggeries have allowed pig farming to be undertaken in countries or areas with unsuitable climate or soil for outdoor pig raising. [...] In an intensive operation, pigs will no longer need access to a wallow (mud), which is their natural cooling mechanism. [...] Intensive piggeries control temperature through ventilation or drip water systems.|$|E
2500|$|Cross-country skiers use a grip wax (also called [...] "kick wax") for classic-style waxable skis {{to provide}} {{traction}} with static friction {{on the snow}} {{that allows them to}} propel themselves forward on flats and up hills. They are applied in an area beneath the skier's foot and extending, somewhat forward, that is formed by the camber of the classic ski, called the [...] "grip zone" [...] (or [...] "kick zone"). The presence of camber allows the skis to grip the snow, when the weight is on one ski and the ski is fully flexed, but minimize drag when the skis are weighted equally and are thus less than fully flexed. [...] Grip waxes are designed for <b>specific</b> <b>temperature</b> ranges and types of snow; a correctly selected grip wax does not appreciably decrease the glide of skis that have proper camber for the skier's weight and for the snow conditions. There are two substances used for grip wax: hard wax and klister.|$|E
