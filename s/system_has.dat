40|$|Abstract：For {{reduction}} {{of the amount of}} CO 2 emitted from ships, power generation characteristics of two power generation systems consisting of a high-efficiency permanent magnet synchronous generator and diode bridge rictifiers are discussed in this paper. One of the discussed <b>systems</b> <b>has</b> three-phase stator windings, and the other has two sets of three-phase (six-phase) stator windings to reduce pulsation in the electromagnetic torque and DC current. Experimental results reveal that the power generation efficiency of the <b>system</b> <b>having</b> six-phase stator windings is higher than that of the <b>system</b> <b>having</b> three-phase stator windings for a light load. The maximum power generation efficiency of the <b>system</b> <b>having</b> six-phase stator windings is almost {{the same as that of}} the <b>system</b> <b>having</b> three-phase stator windings. For the electromagnetic torque of the <b>system</b> <b>having</b> six-phase stator windings, the width of pulsation is about one-fifth compared to the <b>system</b> <b>having</b> three-phase stator windings.
