25|$|<b>Side</b> <b>trawlers</b> – {{have the}} trawl set {{over the side}} with the trawl warps passing through blocks which hang from two gallows, one forward and one aft. Until the late sixties, <b>side</b> <b>trawlers</b> were the most {{familiar}} vessel in the North Atlantic deep sea fisheries. They evolved {{over a longer period}} than other trawler types, but are now being replaced by stern trawlers.|$|R
25|$|Anchor seiners {{have the}} {{wheelhouse}} and accommodation aft {{and the working}} deck amidships, thus resembling <b>side</b> <b>trawlers.</b> The seine net is stored and shot from the stern, and they may carry a power block. Anchor seiners have the coiler and winch mounted transversally amidships.|$|R
2500|$|The {{majority}} of trawlers {{operating on the}} high seas are freezer trawlers. They have facilities for preserving fish by freezing, allowing them to remain at sea for extended periods of time. They are medium to large size trawlers, with the same general arrangement as stern or <b>side</b> <b>trawlers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Mincarlo was {{the type}} of trawler known as a sidewinder or <b>side</b> <b>trawler.</b> On sidewinders, the trawl nets are {{deployed}} over the side with the trawl warps passed through blocks suspended from two gallows. These gallows were forward and aft, on the starboard side of the Mincarlo. The fishing gear consisted of two otter trawls each of which was fitted with otter boards. Otter boards keep the mouth of the trawl net open and are positioned {{in such a way that}} the hydrodynamic forces, acting on them when the net is towed along the seabed, pushes the boards outwards. This keeps the mouth of the net open. The nets were attached to heavy duty ground ropes, 40 ft long, which held the nets on the seabed and ticked up any fish lying on or below the sand. Until the late sixties, sidewinders were the most common deep sea boat used in North Atlantic fisheries. They were used for a longer period than other types of trawler.|$|E

25|$|Outrigger {{trawlers}} – use outriggers to tow the trawl. These {{are commonly}} used to catch shrimp. One or two otter trawls can be towed from each <b>side.</b> Beam <b>trawlers,</b> employed in the North sea for catching flatfish, are another form of outrigger trawler. Medium-sized and high powered vessels, these tow a beam trawl on each side at speeds up to 8 knots.|$|R
25|$|Beam {{trawlers}} – use sturdy outrigger booms for towing a beam trawl, one warp on each <b>side.</b> Double-rig beam <b>trawlers</b> can tow {{a separate}} trawl on each <b>side</b> of the <b>trawler.</b> Beam trawling {{is used in}} the flatfish and shrimp fisheries in the North Sea. They are medium-sized and high powered vessels, towing gear at speeds up to 8 knots. To avoid the boat capsizing if the trawl snags on the sea floor, winch brakes can be installed, along with safety release systems in the boom stays. The engine power of bottom trawlers is also restricted to 2000 HP (1472 KW) for further safety.|$|R
50|$|Zeesenboot {{trawlers}} (Zeesenboote) are sailing boats which {{carry the}} Zeese on two ropes (Reepe) tied to stem and post stem or stem and Driftboom, a cantilever at the stern exceeding {{the length of}} the post stem. The Zeese is always on the luff <b>side,</b> since the <b>trawler</b> draws the net by drifting sidewards under full sail. The reddish color of most Zeesenboot sails derives from their traditional treatment with oak bark, to protect them against fungal infestation; to preserve their traditional look, this typical color is applied also to Zeesenboot sails made of modern materials.|$|R
50|$|Grimsby was {{witness to}} the {{evolution}} of the fishing trawler. It saw the change from the early timber sailing vessels to the introduction of steam which revolutionised the fishing fleet. Steam allowed for powerful vessels to push ever further north and it was soon found that new steel steam trawler design had to evolve further to cope with the extreme environments the ships were required to encounter; the traditional 'bridge aft side' design of trawler was lost to ships with a hardy sleek steel wheelhouse amidships, the ships developed sleek hulls {{with the addition of a}} 'whaleback' forward in an attempt to provide shelter to the fishdeck, steam engines were replaced by modern powerful marine diesel technology and at the final stage of this evolution of the <b>side</b> winder <b>trawler</b> is Ross Tiger. Being built in the 1950s she was constructed the decade prior to Grimsby's introduction to the modern 'stern trawlers' and welded ship construction that changed the profile of the trawler forever. She is also old enough to retain the traditional character, brass and woodwork that is similar to the heritage and atmosphere of trawlers long before her time, but was lost by the 1960s.|$|R
2500|$|Forty {{miles from}} Chu Lai and six {{miles off the}} coast, (map {{reference}} #3) USCGC Androscoggin intercepted a third trawler designated in U.S. Navy records as the Quảng Ngãi Province Trawler. Androscoggin signaled the trawler to identify itself at 0112 {{but there was no}} response so Androscoggin shot 5-inch star shells into the air to illuminate the trawler. It was then that the trawler was positively identified as an SL class North Vietnamese trawler so the Androscoggin opened fire at 0120 with 5-inch high explosive naval gunfire and [...]50 caliber machine guns. The trawler returned fire with a recoilless rifle, laid a smoke screen and turned into Androscoggins direction but one of the cutter's shells hit the after starboard <b>side,</b> so the <b>trawler</b> turned reversed course and headed for the shore. As a result of a civilian junk passing through the battle area the Market Time ships had to cease fire. Two United States Army helicopters were directed engage the trawler with rockets and miniguns at 0129 and after their attack a reduction in the amount of fire coming from the trawler was noticed. [...] At 0140 Point Grey, Point Welcome, PCF-18 and PCF-20 were ordered to take the trawler under fire with mortars and machine guns at close range because the trawler had moved too close to shore for Androscoggin to maneuver. Point Welcome struck the trawler twice with 81-millimeter rounds. The trawler then grounded 50 yards off the mouth of the Tha Cau River at 0210. At 0220, the North Vietnamese tried to scuttle their ship and failed but a second attempt at 0235 succeeded in destroying the vessel in a 500 foot fireball. The explosion caused some damage to the pilothouse of Point Welcome and the deck was littered with debris but no casualties were reported.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} {{with the use of}} the three kinds of trawling net using of by the fishing boats, namely, trawlers, bull trawlers or Danish seiners belonging to the groups of the fishing boats of the mother ship fishery, fishing on the continental shelf of the eastern part of the Bering Sea including near the shelf, during the term from April to October for the three years of 1963, 1965 and 1967. As to the items of the fishing gears used in this research, in table 3, are shown the tonnage of the fishing boat, its number and the scale of the net used in this experiment. Namely, the number of the monther ship is 3; the number of the fishing boats belonging to those mother ships, is as in the following : ― the number of the <b>side</b> <b>trawlers</b> with tonnage of 370, is 2; that of the stern trawlers with the tonnage of 299, is 3; the total of which being 5; that of the bull trawler with the tonnage of 121 and with the tonnage of 98, is 4 and 2; the total number of with being 6; the total number of the Danish seiner is, 11; with the tonnage range from 65 to 92. In case of those trawling nets, in accordance with varieties in the sort of the net, a considerable difference is to be noted both in the weight of the ground rope and in the buoyancy of the float, but the whole lengths of the nets are almost equal. As may be seen in the introduction of this thesis, the purpose of this research is as in the following : ― through the three sorts of the fishing net used as the materials of this experimental research, namely, the trawl net, the bull trawl net, and the Danish seine, the following 3 items were aimed : (1) the attempted clarifications of the fishing efficiency of the fishing net by means of actual measurements and the model experiments; (2) the confirmation of the fundamental characteristics in the designing and making-up the respective net; (3) accompanied with the analyses of the physical and biological factors in drawing the design of the trawling net in possession of high effectivity. The experimental methods used in this research are as in the following : 1. With the use of Radar equipped on board of the mother ship lying at anchor, some tracings were made of the towing speed and the removing distance concerning the nets towed by trawlers, bull trawlers and Danish seiners and as the result of the tracings the sweeping area of the actual net towing was counted, and after combining this counted value with the value of the filtering volume, which will by mentioned in item 3, some numerical value, which is assumed to be indispensable for the determination of the fishing efficiency of the fishing net, was obtained. 2. Concerning Danish seine, in the three stages of the commencement of net to wing, its finishing and the end of net-lifting, the gradual changes in the status of boat and net happening in the lapse of time, were ascertained with the use of experimental models in 50 m. -pool, with the counting clarification of the towing speed, interval between the wing ends, and the sweeping area of the towing rope. 3. On the three sorts of trawling net (trawl net, bull trawl net, Danish seine), model experiments were carried out; and in those experiments, first the area of the net mouth under towing was counted, and {{with the use of the}} counted value, the filtering volume was fixed out, and after combining this with the sweeping area mentioned in item 1, some numerical value was fixed, and by which the fishing efficiency of the various kinds of fishing net was compared. 4. For the purpose of using as the fundamental criterion in drawing the basic designs of the respective trawling net, the following experiments were carried out : ― a) Three sorts of trawling net having the bag nets made to be equal typed, in spite of their being made of 2 sheets, 4 sheets and 6 sheets of net, each of which being typical of the trawling net, were designed, and with the use of these, some model experiments were carried out, and the respective characteristics and efficiency were brought under comparative examinations. b) Concerning the shape of the net under towing, its resistance against the flowing water and the behaviours of the fish schools entering into the net; the causes of such phenomena were put under considerate examinations, and the distribution of the current velocities in and out of the net were measured by using model nets. c) The border line of the limited possibilities of making the turning movements or the respective fish body within the bag net, in other words, the dimension of the swimming capabilities was fixed experimentally. d) The problem of what behaviour is to be taken by the fish schools against the variations of the flowing velocity within the bag net, was put under consideration to bring it to a reasonable solution, in connection with the size of the fish body and in that with the size and the scale of the fish schools, respectively; and at the same, the net formation and the net resistance at that time, were put under investigations. e) In the 50 m. -pool, using gold fish, the behaviours of the fish schools to the rope were brought under grasping, with the investigations of the driving-in effects of the net performed...|$|R
