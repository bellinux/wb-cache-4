40|$|Several core {{issues in}} {{economics}} and biology overlap substantially. At the theoretical level, these include analogies and differences among rational choice, learning, genetic evolution and cultural evolution. At the empirical level, {{they include the}} structure of decision making, its neural basis and, more generally, human nature. We illustrate here the increasingly important collaboration between economics and biology with several characteristic examples, including signaling, markets, <b>statistical</b> reasoning, <b>cooperation,</b> punishment, reputation and social norms. In contrast to the mutual borrowing of ideas during the 1970 s and 1980 s, we now see the joint exploration of empirical and theoretical issues by biologists and economists that constitutes a second wave of interactions between the two disciplines...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{cooperation}} of two feature families for handwritten digit recognition using a committee of Neural Network (NN) classifiers will be examined. Various cooperation schemes will be investigated and corresponding results will be presented. To improve the system reliability,we will upgrade the committee scheme using multistage classification based on rule-based and <b>statistical</b> <b>cooperation.</b> The rule-based cooperation enables an easy and efficient implementation of various rejection criteria while the <b>statistical</b> <b>cooperation</b> offers better possibility for fine-tuning of the recognition versus the reliability tradeoff. The final system has been implemented using rule-based reasoning with rejection criteria for classifier decision fusion and the generalized committee cooperation scheme for classification of the rejected digit patterns. The presented results show that we propose a successful approach for reliability control in committee classifier environment and indicate that a suitable cooperation of statistical and rule-based decision fusion is a promising approach in handwritten recognition systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} new coding scheme that {{combines}} {{the advantages of}} <b>statistical</b> <b>cooperation</b> and algebraic structure. Consider a multiple-access relay channel where two transmitters attempt to send the modulo-sum of their finite field messages to the receiver {{with the help of}} the relay. The transmitters use nested lattice codes to ensure that sums of codewords are protected against noise and to preserve the modulo operation of the finite field. We develop a block Markov coding scheme where the relay recovers the real sum of the codewords and retransmits it coherently with the two transmitters. I...|$|E
30|$|Among the 90 {{possible}} combinations, eight variable pairs exhibit mutualistic {{and three}} exhibit competitive relationships. If the theoretical constructs {{are confined to}} the traditional concepts of competition and <b>cooperation,</b> <b>statistical</b> analysis will identify only relationships that involve symmetrical patterns of variable pairs. Among our possible combinations, however, there are five cases of commensalism and two cases of amensalism. It is notable that the startups variable is involved in only one mutualistic relationship, that with URs (Fig.  1). The dichotomy of competition versus cooperation fails to depict the pathways of influence in the triple helix structure that create new startup ventures.|$|R

40|$|In June 2009, a new EU {{directive}} on {{the promotion}} of renewable energy sources (RES) entered into effect. The directive 2009 / 28 /EC, provides for three cooperation mechanisms that will allow member states to achieve their national RES target in cooperation with other member states: statistical transfer, joint projects, and joint support schemes. This article analyses {{the pros and cons}} of the three mechanisms and explores design options for their implementation through strategic and economic questions: How to counterbalance the major drawbacks of each mechanism? How to reflect a balance of costs and benefits between the involved member states? The analysis identifies a number of design options that respond to these questions, e. g. long term contracts to ensure sufficient flexibility for statistical transfers, a coordinated, standardised joint project approach to increase transparency in the European market, and a stepwise harmonisation of joint support schemes that is based on a cost-effective accounting approach. One conclusion is that the three cooperation mechanisms are closely interlinked. One can consider their relation to be a gradual transition from member state cooperation under fully closed national support systems in case of <b>statistical</b> transfers, to <b>cooperation</b> under fully open national support systems in a joint support scheme.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{wireless sensor networks}} {{deployed to}} observe arbitrary random fields. The requirement is to reconstruct {{an estimate of the}} random field at a certain collector node. This creates a many-to-one data gathering wireless channel. One of the main challenges in this scenario is that the source/channel separation theorem, proved by Shannon for pointto -point links, does not hold anymore. In this paper, we construct novel cooperative source-channel coding schemes that exploit the correlation between the sources and the wireless channel. In particular, we differentiate between two distinct cases. The first case assumes that the sensor nodes are equipped with receivers, and hence, every node can exploit the wireless link to distribute its information to its neighbors. We then devise an efficient deterministic cooperation strategy where the neighboring nodes act as virtual antennas in a beam-forming configuration. The second, and more challenging, scenario restricts the capability of sensor nodes to transmit only. In this case, we argue that statistical cooperative source-channel coding techniques still yield significant performance gains in certain relevant scenarios. Specifically, we propose a low complexity cooperative source-channel coding scheme based on the proper use of low density generator matrix (LDGM) codes. This scheme is shown to outperform the recently proposed joint source-channel coding scheme [6] in the case of highly correlated sources. In both the deterministic and <b>statistical</b> <b>cooperation</b> scenarios, we develop analytical results that guide the optimization of the proposed schemes and validate the performance gains observed in simulations...|$|E
