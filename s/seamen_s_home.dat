40|$|INTRODUCTION The HIV {{epidemic}} in South Africa has increased {{not only the}} number of ill children but also the number of orphans. Although the establishment of orphanages is not sustainable, the number of residential care facilities continues to increase. Many persons working in South African children <b>s</b> <b>homes</b> can testify to the impact HIV has had on this sector, but no studies have actually measured it. AIMS The primary aim {{of this research was}} to determine the impact of HIV on the Johannesburg children <b>s</b> <b>homes.</b> The secondary aims were to make recommendations informed by this research to assist children <b>s</b> <b>homes</b> to mitigate the impact and to inform the activities of the Children <b>s</b> <b>Homes</b> Outreach Medical Programme (CHOMP). METHODS A rapid appraisal of all children <b>s</b> <b>homes</b> in the greater Johannesburg was done by means of a telephonic survey. This was followed by an in depth analysis of 24 children <b>s</b> <b>homes</b> through the use of questionnaires, data collection forms, a pop quiz for residential child care workers and the inspection of facilities. RESULTS A total of 115 residential care facilities with a population (excluding the special needs homes) of 5 934 were identified. In a sample of 24 homes, 31, 7...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{right to}} {{adequate}} food is protected in {{international human rights}} law, yet {{millions of people are}} suffering from malnutrition worldwide. Children and adolescents living in children <b>s</b> <b>homes</b> are considered a vulnerable group. Malnutrition in the girl child is of particular concern since it has intergenerational consequences. Little is known about the nutritional status of adolescent girls living in children <b>s</b> <b>homes</b> in Kampala City, Uganda. A cross-sectional study is an important first step to identify the main nutritional challenges in order to intervene appropriately. Aim: The main aim {{of the study was to}} assess the nutritional status of adolescent girls in children <b>s</b> <b>homes</b> in Kampala City, by evaluating anthropometric indicators, assessing body composition and investigating dietary patterns. Subjects and methods: A total of 44 girls aged 10 – 19 years living at five children <b>s</b> <b>homes</b> participated in the study. A reference group consisted of 27 adolescent girls from three boarding schools in Kampala City. Height and weight were measured to assess the proportion of girls who were stunted, thin, overweight or obese. Body composition data was obtained by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Dietary intake was evaluated with a Food Frequency Questionnaire, calculation of dietary diversity score (DDS) and a 24 -hour dietary recall. Results: Adolescent girls in selected children <b>s</b> <b>homes</b> in Kampala City suffered from stunting, overweight or obesity, and were at risk of insufficient intakes of multiple micronutrients and essential fatty acids. Dietary diversity was low with a median score of 3 out of 9 food groups. Animal products were rarely consumed. Children <b>s</b> <b>home</b> participants appeared especially at risk of inadequate intake of vitamins A, B 12, C, D, E and calcium. Median estimated intake of vitamins B 12 and D were zero. The adequacy of the diet in terms of energy, macronutrients and micronutrients varied among the different children <b>s</b> <b>homes,</b> and within the various homes. At two of the children <b>s</b> <b>homes</b> the girls consumed a more adequate diet compared to the reference group, whereas three homes consumed a less adequate diet compared to the reference group. Conclusion: Malnutrition was apparent among children <b>s</b> <b>home</b> participants, manifested as stunting, overweight or obesity. The girls are likely to suffer from inadequate intake of essential fatty acids and multiple micronutrient deficiencies, especially vitamin B 12...|$|R

40|$|Background: More than 14 {{percent of}} {{children}} in Uganda are orphaned, {{and many of them}} live in children <b>s</b> <b>homes.</b> Very little information exists regarding how these homes are operated and what the conditions in these homes are like. A baseline study conducted in forty children <b>s</b> <b>homes</b> revealed however that diet was very limited, and residents were looking malnourished. Ugandan authorities have targeted adolescent girls as a priority group for nutrition interventions as safeguarding nutritional health before pregnancy can reduce the chance of passing on malnutrition to the offspring, and thus, future generations. By being State Party to relevant international and regional human rights instruments, Ugandan authorities have obligations under international human rights law to progressively realise the rights to adequate food, health and care (the underlying conditions for achieving good nutrition) for all Ugandan children, female adolescent children <b>s</b> <b>homes</b> residents included. Objectives: Two objectives guided this study: 1) To examine female adolescent residents experiences, attitudes and views regarding: i) eating patterns and food, ii) health conditions; iii) care practices in the children <b>s</b> <b>home</b> they are living in. 2) On the basis of the findings under 1), to consider if the conditions in children <b>s</b> <b>homes</b> comply with human rights standards and principles for the rights to adequate food, health and care. Methodology: A human rights-based approach has guided the planning and conduct of this study, which also resulted in using focus group discussions as the method for data collection. Five children <b>s</b> <b>homes</b> in Kampala were selected for inclusion. At each home, two focus group discussions were held with girls aged 12 - 14 years, and girls aged 15 - 17, respectively. Issues discussed during the focused discussions included the ones under Objective 1. The focus group discussions were analysed through a phenomenological approach. The conditions of food, health and care, as experienced by female adolescent residents, were further compared with international standards for the realisation of the human rights to adequate food, health and care. Results: Results of Objective 1 demonstrated that food, health and care conditions varied greatly across the five children <b>s</b> <b>homes</b> in Kampala. Some residents consume only one meal per day, and have no access to clean drinking water, soap, toilet paper and sanitary napkins. Residents at one home explained how caretakers act discriminatory and mentally abuse them. This was in large contrast with conditions in two other homes where residents described great satisfaction with food and meal frequency, had a constant availability of basic necessities including clean drinking water, and where care is promoted through participatory activities where both residents and caretakers are equalised. Results of Objective 2 demonstrated that the full realisation of the right to adequate food is not met by the residents at three homes, the full realisation of the right to health is not met by the residents at two homes, and the realisation of the right to care is not met by the residents at one home. Conclusion: Human rights standards for food, health and care were not met in three of the selected children <b>s</b> <b>homes.</b> The results from this study indicated that care in the children <b>s</b> <b>homes</b> was an important contributing factor for whether or not standards for the rights to adequate food and health were met. Ugandan authorities should put in all efforts possible to improve the conditions. As an immediate response, they can revise and enhance regulations for operation of children <b>s</b> <b>homes</b> in Uganda to include more specific provisions relevant for food, health and care...|$|R
40|$|The {{attitude}} toward child care {{agencies in the}} United States was significantly changed {{during the second half}} of the nineteenth century. A review of the social and child welfare climate during the latter stage of the nineteenth century is a requisite for obtaining a deeper understanding of how and why new child care agencies were founded. ^ In the last decade of the nineteenth century, growing concerns about the care being provided to children led agencies and child care providers to provide relief to these children and their families. One of the trends was the establishment of institutions for children and the placement of children in adoption and foster care. The state of Nebraska, during the nineteenth century, did not have adoption agencies that would provide private placement for either foster children or children who were wards of the state. The Nebraska Children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Home</b> Society was created to address the concerns and issues facing family and child care in Nebraska during the late nineteenth century. ^ The purpose of this dissertation was to trace the historic evolution of the Nebraska Children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Home</b> Society from the Society 2 ̆ 7 s beginning through its first 100 years of development. The study was restricted to the historical, administrative, leadership, and financial issues of the Children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Home</b> Society. After data were collected and reviewed, a schema was developed consisting of time periods and topics within each respective period. The time periods evolved around critical events and developments of the Children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Home</b> Society. Special emphasis was given to administrative, leadership, and financial issues faced by the Children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Home</b> Society throughout the Society 2 ̆ 7 s growth.

40|$|This {{culminating}} {{experience was}} a practice based intervention conducted by an organization, utilizing an intervention mapping approach {{for the program}} planning. It took place summer 2010 through spring 2011 and included incorporating a community garden into the Gusto wellness program at The Women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Home.</b> This organization offers long-term residential care, and therapeutic services. Literature relating to community gardens and nutrition behavior change was reviewed. Short-term objectives included: 1) Conducting a needs assessment using focus groups, 2) Designing gardening program components based on intervention mapping guidelines, 3) Constructing a garden bed at Midtown Community Garden for use of The Women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Home,</b> 4) Planning and implementing gardening education, and 5) Assessing feasibility of the garden program. The target population included 24 residents living at the residential dormitory of The Women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Home</b> {{at the time of}} this project. The major variables are intervention mapping constructs including: 1) Needs assessment, 2) Preparing matrices of change objectives, 3) Selecting theory-informed intervention methods and practical strategies, 4) Producing program components and materials, 5) Planning program adoption, implementation, and sustainability, and 6) Planning for evaluation. The specific focus was lack of access to fresh fruits and vegetables (FV) for this population. Focus group responses revealed interest in community garden participation. Matrices of change were developed for lack of FV access based on performance objectives for behavioral and environmental factors and related determinants and theory. Methods and strategies were developed to implement a community garden and encourage participation. Program components included initiating a garden club, networking activities, creating gardening curriculum, and participating at Midtown Community Garden. Adoption and implementation performance objectives were outlined, and many were carried out. Evaluation questions were designed and outcomes of the garden project were discussed. ^ Outcomes of the project included exposure of garden topics and activities for The Women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Home</b> residents, focus group responses revealing an interest in gardening among this population, gardening program components designed based on intervention mapping steps, and a constructed garden bed that was used for planting vegetables and flowers through fall 2010. Limited resources and budget along with a lack of a residential coordinator at The Women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Home</b> were the main limiting factors for this project.

PARTICIPANTS: Participants were residents of 831 U. <b>S.</b> <b>homes</b> in the survey. EVALUATIONS/MEASUREMENTS: We analyzed allergen, questionnaire, and observational data of 831 U. <b>S.</b> <b>homes.</b> RESULTS: Cockroach allergen (Bla g 1) concentrations exceed 2. 0 U/g, a level associated with allergic sensitization, in 11 % of U. S. living room floors and 13 % of kitchen floors. Concentrations exceed 8. 0 U/g, a level associated with asthma morbidity, in 3 % of living room floors and 10 % of kitchen floors. Elevated concentrations were observed in high-rise apartments, urban settings, pre- 1940 constructions, and households with incomes 8. 0 U/g were greatest when roach problems were reported or observed and increased {{with the number of}} cockroaches observed and with indications of recent cockroach activity.
