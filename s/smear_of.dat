The manuscript of the workbook report from the Chemical Examination Laboratory shows over-writing in four places. Using a whitener and a different ink, the word ‘‘not’’ has been added to the word ‘‘detected,’. The lab explained that it was quite normal to make corrections in the manuscript. Even Varghese P Thomas, the first investigating officer, said the post mortem and lab reports had ruled out rape, leaving no scope for suspicions on the veracity of the report.|$|E
25|$|Last week, Frank Hawks {{shuttled}} to East Aurora, N. Y. to {{show off}} his polliwog to a prospect, Sportsman J. Hazard Campbell. He landed neatly on the polo field in a nearby estate at about 5 p.m., climbed out, chatted awhile with Prospect Campbell and a cluster of friends. Presently he and Campbell took off smartly, cleared a fence, went atilt between two tall trees, and passed from sight. Then there was a rending crash, a <b>smear</b> <b>of</b> flame, silence. Half a mile the fearful group raced from the polo field. From the crackling wreck they pulled Frank Hawks; from beneath a burning wing, Prospect Campbell — both fatally hurt. The ship that could not stub its toe aground had tripped on overhead telephone wires.|$|E

500|$|In Utero debuted {{at number}} one on the Billboard 200 album chart in September 1993.

In Utero went on to sell over 3.5 million copies in the United States. That October, Nirvana embarked on its first tour of the United States in two years with support from Half Japanese and The Breeders. For the tour, the band added Pat <b>Smear</b> <b>of</b> the punk rock band Germs as a second guitarist. In November 1993, Nirvana recorded a performance for the television program MTV Unplugged. Augmented by Smear and cellist Lori Goldston, the band sought to veer from the typical approach to the show, opting to stay away from playing its most recognizable songs. Instead, Nirvana performed several covers, and invited Cris and Curt Kirkwood of the Meat Puppets to join the group for renditions of three of their songs. In September 1993, the band made its second appearance on Saturday Night Live, where they played [...] "Heart-Shaped Box" [...] and [...] "Rape Me".|$|E

2500|$|The hole walls for boards {{with two}} or more layers can be made {{conductive}} and then electroplated with copper to form plated-through holes. [...] These holes electrically connect the conducting layers of the PCB. For multi-layer boards, those with three layers or more, drilling typically produces a <b>smear</b> <b>of</b> the high temperature decomposition products of bonding agent in the laminate system. Before the holes can be plated through, this smear must be removed by a chemical de-smear process, or by plasma-etch. The de-smear process ensures that a good connection is made to the copper layers when the hole is plated through. On high reliability boards a process called etch-back is performed chemically with a potassium permanganate based etchant or plasma. [...] The etch-back removes resin and the glass fibers so that the copper layers extend into the hole and as the hole is plated become integral with the deposited copper.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Habitual arecanut chewing is {{associated}} with Oral Submucous Fibrosis (OSF). High copper content in arecanut plays {{a vital role in}} pathogenesis of OSF. This study evaluates the copper-staining pattern of buccal epithelial cells in oral cytological <b>smears</b> <b>of</b> non-chewers, chewers, and OSF. MATERIALS & METHODS: Alcohol fixed buccal epithelial <b>smears</b> <b>of</b> 10 histopathologically confirmed cases of OSF, 10 chewers without lesion, and 5 nonchewers were stained with modified Rhodamine technique and studied under the light microscope. Buccal epithelial <b>smears</b> <b>of</b> non-chewers dipped in copper sulphate solution were used as known positive for copper. RESULT: Copper appeared as shades of palered within the cytoplasm of chewers and did not show any stain in non-chewers. Intense red stain was seen in OSF smears as dark granules within the cytoplasm. CONCLUSION: Intense staining of copper in OSF buccal smears, than in the chewers supports the role of copper in the pathogenesis of OSF...|$|R

40|$|The thermocapillary {{motion of}} {{initially}} spherical drops/bubbles {{driven by a}} constant temperature gradient in an unbounded liquid medium is simulated numerically. Effects of convection of momentum and energy, as well as shape deformations, are addressed. The method used is based on interface tracking on a base cartesian grid, and uses a smeared color or indicator function for {{the determination of the}} surface topology. Quad-tree adaptive refinement of the cartesian grid is implemented to enhance the fidelity of the surface tracking. It is shown that convection of energy results in a slowing of the drop, as the isotherms get wrapped around the front of the drop. Shape deformation resulting from inertial effects affect the migration velocity. The physical results obtained are in agreement with the existing literature. Furthermore, remarks are made on the sensitivity of the calculated solutions to the <b>smearing</b> <b>of</b> the fluid properties. Analysis and simulations show that the migration velocity depends very strongly on the <b>smearing</b> <b>of</b> the interfacial force whereas it is rather insensitive to the <b>smearing</b> <b>of</b> other properties, hence the adaptive grid...|$|R
