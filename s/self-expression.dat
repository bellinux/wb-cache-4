5|$|During the Northern Song (960–1126 CE), a {{new class}} of scholar-artists emerged who did not possess the tromp l'oiel skills of the academy {{painters}} nor even the proficiency of common marketplace painters. The literati's painting was simpler and at times quite unschooled, yet they would criticize these other two groups as mere professionals, since they relied on paid commissions for their livelihood and did not paint merely for enjoyment or <b>self-expression.</b> The scholar-artists considered that painters who concentrated on realistic depictions, who employed a colorful palette, or, worst of all, who accepted monetary payment for their work were no better than butchers or tinkers in the marketplace. They were not to be considered real artists.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} {{of sexual activity}} between women as necessary to define a lesbian or a relationship continues to be debated. According to feminist writer Naomi McCormick, women's sexuality is constructed by men, whose primary indicator of lesbian sexual orientation is sexual experience with other women. The same indicator {{is not necessary to}} identify a woman as heterosexual, however. McCormick states that emotional, mental, and ideological connections between women are as important or more so than the genital. Nonetheless, in the 1980s, a significant movement rejected the desexualization of lesbianism by cultural feminists, causing a heated controversy called the feminist sex wars. Butch and femme roles returned, although not as strictly followed {{as they were in the}} 1950s. They became a mode of chosen sexual <b>self-expression</b> for some women in the 1990s. Once again, women felt safer claiming to be more sexually adventurous, and sexual flexibility became more accepted.|$|E

5|$|Of Tchaikovsky's Western contemporaries, Robert Schumann {{stands out}} as an {{influence}} in formal structure, harmonic practices and piano writing, according to Brown and musicologist Roland John Wiley. As mentioned earlier, Asafyev comments that Schumann left his mark on Tchaikovsky {{not just as a}} formal influence but also as an example of musical dramaturgy and <b>self-expression.</b> Leon Botstein claims the music of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner also left their imprints on Tchaikovsky's orchestral style. The late-Romantic trend for writing orchestral suites, begun by Franz Lachner, Jules Massenet, and Joachim Raff after the rediscovery of Bach's works in that genre, may have influenced Tchaikovsky to try his own hand at them. His teacher Anton Rubinstein's opera The Demon became a model for the final tableau of Eugene Onegin. So did Léo Delibes' ballets Coppélia and Sylvia for The Sleeping Beauty and Georges Bizet's opera Carmen (a work Tchaikovsky admired tremendously) for The Queen of Spades. Otherwise, it was to composers of the past that Tchaikovsky turned—Beethoven, whose music he respected; Mozart, whose music he loved; Glinka, whose opera A Life for the Tsar made an indelible impression on him as a child and whose scoring he studied assiduously; and Adolphe Adam, whose ballet Giselle was a favorite of his from his student days and whose score he consulted while working on The Sleeping Beauty. Beethoven's string quartets may have influenced Tchaikovsky's attempts in that medium. Other composers whose work interested Tchaikovsky included Hector Berlioz, Felix Mendelssohn, Giacomo Meyerbeer, and Henry Litolff.|$|E

40|$|This study {{looks into}} the TV dating reality shows in postmillennial China. These widely popular shows, {{exemplified}} by Fei Cheng Wu Rao (translated as If You Are the One), open up an ongoing social forum, which, to varying extents, enables the <b>self-expressions</b> of a particular group of Chinese women (young, educated, upper-middle class) while excluding the voices of those falling behind the selected categories. Through the lens of critical discourse analysis, I focus on analyzing the women participants’ self-introductions, their verbal exchanges with the male participants, and the remarks of the host and the two expert commentators. I argue that the dating shows simultaneously reflect and deflect the predicament of Chinese single women, the so-called “sheng nü” (“leftover women”), who strive for upward social mobility yet face the dilemma of adopting the traditional gender roles of the wife and the mother. I further posit that the shows tag single women negatively and disseminate bias toward single womanhood. Ultimately, my analysis reveals that the dating shows become a social disempowering mechanism that repositions women along China’s new social and gender hierarchies and reinforces male privilege in postsocialist China...|$|R

Following the collapse of Balinese traditional court, the arrival of western artists and scholars, Pita Maha association was established to prevent the excess of commercialism to Balinese arts and crafts. A new generation of artists started to emerge, not only they adopted western painting techniques taught by their western ‘gurus’, but they also showed freedom of <b>self-expressions</b> in their works; one considered as a genius was Gusti Nyoman Lempad. The aim {{of this research was}} to compare the artistic transformation before Pita Maha and after Pita Maha. It was done by analyzing examples of Kamasan styled painting and works of Lempad through the qualitative method with a case study approach. The analyses show the differences between both styles regarding themes, iconographies, human figures proportions and composition, presentation of narrative stories, decorative elements and availability of artists’ signature in the paintings. It shows the artistic transformation of Balinese art.

The last ten years have witnessed {{an increasing number of}} research in digital discourse as the role of computer-mediated communication continues to expand in modern life. However, digital data can be hard to pin down because the identities of participants engaging in online activities are difficult to anchor and the boundaries between private and public space, online and offline context are notoriously blurry. This presentation will mainly bring out two issues in relation to the fuzzy line between public and private in digital discourse: which factors will invalidate the traditional dichotomy of public space and private space and how does the fluidity of this boundary influence the evaluation and interpretation of digital <b>self-expressions.</b> The preliminary observations suggest that cyberspace can be semi-public, but can also be highly private and highly public at the same time. To decipher the shifting boundaries between the mass communication and interpersonal communication, researchers should take into consideration the affordances of social media, participant frameworks as well as other nuanced factors that intervene in this process...|$|R
40|$|Humans {{can express}} their own emotion and {{estimate}} the emotional states of others during communication. This paper proposes a unified model that can estimate the emotional states {{of others and}} generate emotional <b>self-expressions.</b> The proposed model utilizes a multimodal restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) —a type of stochastic neural network. RBMs can abstract latent information from input signals and reconstruct the signals from it. We use these two characteristics to rectify issues affecting previously proposed emotion models: constructing an emotional representation for estimation and generation for emotion instead of heuristic features, and actualizing mental simulation to infer the emotion of others from their ambiguous signals. Our experimental {{results showed that the}} proposed model can extract features representing the distribution of categories of emotion via self-organized learning. Imitation experiments demonstrated that using our model, a robot can generate expressions better than with a direct mapping mechanism when the expressions of others contain emotional inconsistencies. Moreover, our model can improve the estimated belief in the emotional states of others through the generation of imaginary sensory signals from defective multimodal signals (i. e., mental simulation). These results suggest that these abilities of the proposed model can facilitate emotional human–robot communication in more complex situations...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study aims {{to explore}} the lived {{experiences}} of rural students in Korea in words and visual images using Photovoice. Three sessions were conducted over one month in 2014 with six elementary students. Data was collected by student photovoice in their life. Spiral data analysis was used for analyzing the data. The following results were obtained. First, conducting an expression activity class using photo voice involves a process of practicing, reflecting, and observing class, and learned knowledge that comes into one's life through the completion and organization of photovoice. Exploration through questions led students to make creative expressions through movement. Photovoice, which was made as the class was organized, made students “review” those photos that were not seen in the context. As a result, the expression activity design of the narrative curriculum allowed movement-oriented expression activities to promote intellectual growth and enable students to make diverse and creative <b>self-expressions.</b> Second, students learned this through practice {{and the experience of}} using photo voice. As they sought knowledge in everyday life on their own by talking with other people and discussing the developed photos, they began to derive meaning from them. Photovoice proved to be an activity through which one can realize an expression activity through the quest for knowledge in daily life. Thus, the narrative curriculum's expression activity established a link between the knowledge learned in school and students’ lives...|$|R

40|$|This thesis compares {{conversations between}} British tutors and British students, and conversations between British tutors and Japanese students, in English {{in order to}} {{investigate}} differences and similarities in their listenership behaviour {{in relation to the}} use of response tokens in the context of academic supervision sessions. A new method for conversation analysis to synthesise visual data with verbal data on timeline has been established. The concept of leadtime, which is a time scale to measure a distance between a point where a particular response token is uttered to a point where a turn transition occurs, has been introduced to implement the research method. Approaches in conversation analysis, roles of context, and intercultural communication are reviewed in this thesis. In addition, participants' assumptions of framing and turn-taking structure in conversation and <b>self-expressions</b> in listenership with reflection of their cultural values in interlanguage settings have been taken into consideration. The results from the preliminary research are summarised as follows: 1. Similarities in use of strategies for framework shifts, such as increase and decrease of response tokens before floor-taking, and multi-functional nature of hand gestures, such as hand gestures used for speaker change and metaphoric signs, have been recognised between the British-British conversations and the British-Japanese conversation. 2. L 1 (first language) transfer has been observed in the Japanese students’use of response tokens, such as their constant use of head nods at a particular pace.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to help answer the question: Do women with nontraditional attitudes toward {{the role of women in}} society obtain higher self-concept scores than women with more traditional attitudes toward the role of women? A second question was also investigated: Do women with non-traditional attitudes toward the role of women report that they behave more assertively than women with more traditional attitudes? One hundred and eighty-five undergraduate females were administered the Tennessee Self Concept Scale (TSCS), the Attitudes Toward Women Scale (AWS), and the College <b>Self-Expressions</b> Scale (CSES). Subjects were included in one of the three experimental groups on the basis of their scores on the AWS. The traditional group was composed of 13 women whose AWS scores were 1. 5 standard deviations or more below the AWS scores were 1. 5 standard deviations or more below the AWS mean for the sample, the middle group was composed of 16 women whose AWS scores were within one point of the AWS mean for the sample: the nontraditional group was composed of 14 women whore AWS score were 1. 5 standard deviations or more above the AWS mean for the sample. The data were analyzed by means of a Kruskal-Walls one-way analysis of variance by ranks test. Results indicated that there were no differences among the three experimental groups in self-concept scores. The data indicated, however, that there were differences among the groups in self-reported assertive behavior.

40|$|Arts have {{consistently}} {{been part of}} {{life as well as}} healing throughout the history of humankind. Today, expressive therapies have an increasingly recognized role in mental health, rehabilitation and medicine. The expressive therapies are defined as the use of art, music, dance/movement drama, poetry/creative writing, play and sand play within the context of psychotherapy, counseling, rehabilitation or health care. Through the centuries, the healing nature of these expressive therapies has been primarily reported in anecdotes that describe a way of restoring wholeness to a person struggling with either mind or body illness. The Egyptians are reported to have encouraged people with mental illness to engage in artistic activity (Fleshman & Fryrear, 1981); the Greeks used drama and music for its reparative properties (Gladding, 1992); and the story of King Saul in the Bible describes music’s calming attributes. Later, in Europe during the Renaissance, English physician and writer Robert Burton theorized that imagination played a role in health and well-being, while Italian philosopher de feltre proposed that dance and Play was central to children’s healthy growth and development (Coughlin, 1990). The idea of using the arts as an adjunct to medical treatment emerged in the period from the late 1800 s to the 1900 s alongside the advent of psychiatry. For example, documented uses of music as therapy can be found following World War I when “miracle cures” were reported, resulting form reaching patients through music when they responded to nothing else. The creative arts therapies became more widely known during the 1930 s and 1940 s when psychotherapists and artists began to realize that <b>self-expressions</b> through nonverbal methods such as painting, music making, or movement/dance might be helpful for people with severe mental illness...|$|R

40|$|Empress Dowager Cixi was {{the last}} {{formidable}} imperial woman of dynastic China and the de facto ruler of the Qing Empire between 1862 and 1908. Her significance in modern Chinese politics is well studied, but the matriarch's encompassing engagement in art remains understudied. This dissertation examines concentrically Cixi's avid participation in portraiture, attire and daily accessories, painting and calligraphy, as well as imperial garden palaces, to illuminate her <b>self-expressions</b> in visual and material cultures. I argue that Cixi utilized the notion of court art as a symbolic realm of sovereignty and adapted prior Qing rulers' patterns of representing authority to visualize the power she exercised. As such, the late Qing court art organizations were at her service to stage her performance as a female ruler. While adopting the visual language of imperial portraiture to represent her authority, the strategic choices of subjects and motifs in the portrait maintained the sitter's womanly identity. In the realm of decorative arts, Cixi manipulated the production of imperial porcelain ware to assert {{her role as a}} ruler, but she imprinted a touch of feminine taste in the porcelain by using designs that shared similar color schemes and patterns with those on imperial women's attire. In comparison, the matriarch's performance of the high arts operated differently. Cixi displayed the fondness and capability to participate in the gentlemen's arts. She also spared no effort to model after the painting and calligraphic works of earlier Qing emperors to make an intimate connection with the imperial genealogy. The most ambitious dimension of her patronage lies in the empress dowager's renovation and reconstruction of the imperial space, whose apex was the reconstruction of the Gardens of Nurtured Harmony, which was transformed into an arena of female agency...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, data streams {{have become}} {{ubiquitous}} as technology is improving {{and the prices}} of sensor, location-tracking and portable devices are falling. Examples of streaming data include observations from sensor networks, location updates from GPS devices, measurements from health monitoring devices, status updates, comments and <b>self-expressions</b> from users on the web, e. g., by “twittering”. The current state-of-the-art Data Stream Management Systems (or short DSMSs) typically consider a very simple streaming environment, where data streams transmit only data tuples, and based on these arriving data tuples, continuous queries are evaluated on the server. For execution of a continuous query, typically, a single execution plan (based on the latest overall statistics) is employed for processing all arriving data. ^ We believe that such “first-generation” DSMSs (or as we also refer to them “Streams 1. 0 ” systems), while enabling users and applications to pose queries over data streams, are, however, ill-equipped to support many of the functionalities crucial to the newly-emerging streaming applications, e. g., ubiquitous healthcare or geo-social networking. Motivated by the growing trend of such new stream-based applications, in this thesis, we propose to equip DSMSs with several important functionalities, namely: (1) the access control enforcement for security of streaming data, (2) the tagging of streaming data for producing “richer” and more meaningful results, and (3) the diversity-aware query processing for efficient processing of queries, where subsets of data may exhibit distinct statistical properties. For each of the above features, we provide the concrete problem definition, the motivating examples, develop and analyze algorithms, and present the experimental results using a general-purpose DSMS prototype. We believe that the ideas presented in this thesis can significantly contribute {{the development of the}} “next generation” of DSMSs – or the so-called “Streams 2. 0 ” systems. ...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedThis is a {{case study}} of a therapeutic-religious {{community}} that serves GLBT African Americans, many of whom are economically at the margins and have problematic backgrounds. I present a portrait of this community, and describe what therapeutic religion might "look" like. I draw from ethnographic data, interviews, and sermons, and illustrate how the congregation has been transformed into a "disaster manager" of sorts, offering a faith-based solution to people with traumatic and problematic histories.; While therapeutic societies strive to equip individuals with "psychological capital," by giving people permission to engage in <b>self-expressions</b> and emotional release and by affirming the total person, regardless of the person's social identities and/or background, the experimental nature of therapeutic societies inadvertently may lead to certain excesses. Notably, this dissertation finds that the therapeutic ethic that characterizes Unity Fellowship Church has enabled some freedoms that are otherwise disallowed in traditional congregations. The visibility and regularity of certain behaviors, along with the permissive [...] indeed, sometimes graphic [...] sermon language, call attention to some of these excesses.; But {{this is not to say}} that therapeutic societies simply disregard conventional norms altogether. In fact, the interview narratives and sermons suggest that: 1) the church founder/pastor has set boundaries for his congregants; and 2) congregation members desire rules, boundaries, and traditions. Moreover, for the people the therapeutic societies serve, the occasional "messiness" associated with excess freedom matters far less than their need for a religion that does not alienate people. Hence, if the immediate goal of a congregation or society is to eliminate human suffering, distinctly therapeutic and highly experimental ways of doing things may be pivotal to help reintegrate the wounded back into the community folds. To this end, this dissertation suggests that therapeutic religion [...] especially in the context of marginalized populations [...] will require far more than what traditional religion offers. In particular, this dissertation finds that congregations may need to integrate diverse functions (in particular, the therapeutic functions) into its religious repertoire and develop a hybrid religious form that combines religion and therapy in relatively equal measures...|$|R
