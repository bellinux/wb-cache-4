He was the third after {{his father and grandfather}} to be called James Backhouse. His grandfather died as a Quaker prisoner and martyr at Lancaster Castle in 1697. His father, James, (together with his father and brother), founded the Backhouse's Bank in Darlington. His mother was Mary Dearman of Thorne, Yorkshire, also a devout Quaker. His father died {{when he was a child}} and his mother brought him up in a religious atmosphere. He was educated in Leeds and began work in a grocery, drug and chemical business, but he developed tuberculosis and became too delicate to pursue a <b>sedentary</b> <b>occupation.</b> Coming from a family of botanists, he was encouraged to spend time in the open air and study botany. An uncle helped him in this and he made botanical trips to Upper Teesdale with the Durham lead miner, John Binks (1766-1817) who is credited with the discovery of many of the area’s rare plants. Binks was a major influence, as was the Newcastle botanist, Nathaniel John Winch, and William Jackson Hooker (1785-1865). James then spent two years near Norwich learning the nursery trade, and where he first conceived of ‘a gospel errand into Australia’ believing strongly that this was the will of God.|$|E
5000|$|... "Departed this life, Lord's day, June 29, 1862 at his {{residence}} in South Union Street, Dundee, Mr. J. B. Lindsay. Some {{of our readers}} will remember a recent review of a critical and learned [...] "Treatise on the Mode and Subjects of Baptism" [...] which Mr. Lindsay had then just published. On {{a recent visit to}} Dundee we had an interesting conversation with the author upon more advanced truths, and a brief inspection of his great and still incomplete work - a Dictionary of 53 Languages, upon which he has labored closely since 1828. He commenced with 150 languages, but in time concluded that three lives would be requisite to its completion and therefore reduced the number. When we saw it, he deemed himself able, if spared, to finish the work within one year. His treatise upon baptism is the work of a scholar, and places before the reader that exhaustive proof that immersion is the one and only action commanded by the Saviour which can only be reached as the result of complete classical research. Recently the author put on the Lord in baptism and cast his lot with brethren who continue steadfastly observing the order of the Lord's house. He was born at Carmullie, in 1799, and commenced life by an apprenticeship to the loom, although at times he would leave his <b>sedentary</b> <b>occupation</b> for the more agreeable one of the plough. By deep application, and by constantly snatching the leisure moments which might present themselves for reading, he acquired considerable knowledge, and began to aspire to a university education, which he obtained at St. Andrews. The study of languages, as well as more abstruse scientific subjects, occupied the chief part of his attention, and to which he applied himself with all his native love of learning. In 1841 he was appointed teacher at the Dundee prison, which appointment he held till he resigned it in 1858. During the whole of this time he scarcely ever moved from his house, except to the prison and back, and the result of a portion of his labors was discovered to his friends in conversations and experiments relating to electrical phenomena, which revealed to them the fact that, alone and unaided - from the sheer force of his genius - he had discovered as early, if not earlier, than Morse or Wheatstone, the principles of the present system of electric telegraphy. Immediately after the public adoption of the present system of land-telegraphy, Mr. Lindsay directed his attention to the sending of messages across water by means of insulated wires, and succeeded - after several trials on ponds and sheets of water in the neighborhood - in establishing on a sure basis the principles of electric communication by means of insulated submerged wires.|$|E

40|$|Background Osteoporosis is a {{debilitating}} disease and its risk {{can be reduced}} through adequate calcium consumption and physical activity. This protocol paper describes a workplace-based intervention targeting behaviour change in premenopausal women working in <b>sedentary</b> <b>occupations.</b> Method/Design A cluster-randomised design was used, comparing the efficacy of a tailored intervention to standard care. Workplaces were the clusters and units of randomisation and intervention. Sample size calculations incorporated the cluster design. Final number of clusters {{was determined to be}} 16, based on a cluster size of 20 and calcium intake parameters (effect size 250 mg, ICC 0. 5 and standard deviation 290 mg) as it required the highest number of clusters. Sixteen workplaces were recruited from a pool of 97 workplaces and randomly assigned to intervention and control arms (eight in each). Women meeting specified inclusion criteria were then recruited to participate. Workplaces in the intervention arm received three participatory workshops and organisation wide educational activities. Workplaces in the control/standard care arm received print resources. Intervention workshops were guided by self-efficacy theory and included participatory activities such as goal setting, problem solving, local food sampling, exercise trials, group discussion and behaviour feedback. Outcomes measures were calcium intake (milligrams/day) and physical activity level (duration: minutes/week), measured at baseline, four weeks and six months post intervention. Discussion This study addresses the current lack of evidence for behaviour change interventions focussing on osteoporosis prevention. It addresses missed opportunities of using workplaces as a platform to target high-risk individuals with <b>sedentary</b> <b>occupations.</b> The intervention was designed to modify behaviour levels to bring about risk reduction. It is the first to address dietary and physical activity components each with unique intervention strategies in the context of osteoporosis prevention. The intervention used locally relevant behavioural strategies previously shown to support good outcomes in other countries. The combination of these elements have not been incorporated in similar studies in the past, supporting the study hypothesis that the intervention will be more efficacious than standard practice in osteoporosis prevention through improvements in calcium intake and physical activity...|$|R

Results: In comparison with moderate exercise, the high, low, and nil exercise groups had an odds ratio (OR) for moderate-severe OSA of 0. 6 (95 % CI 0. 5 – 0. 8), 1. 6 (95 % CI 1. 2 – 2. 0), and 2. 7 (95 % CI 1. 9 – 3. 7), respectively. Relative to men in heavy activity occupations, men in medium, light and <b>sedentary</b> <b>occupations</b> had an OR for moderate-severe OSA of 1. 7 (95 % CI 1. 1 – 2. 5), 2. 1 (95 % CI 1. 4 – 3. 2), and 1. 8 (95 % CI 1. 2 – 2. 8), respectively. Relative to women in medium activity occupations, women in light and <b>sedentary</b> <b>occupations</b> had an OR for moderate-severe OSA of 4. 2 (95 % CI 2. 6 – 7. 2) and 3. 5 (2. 0 – 6. 0). OSA patients who adequately exercised had lower: levels of doctor-diagnosed depression (p = 0. 047); symptoms of fatigue (p < 0. 0001); systolic (p = 0. 015) and diastolic blood pressure (p = 0. 015); and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0. 003). Conclusions: Low levels of physical activity were associated with moderate-severe OSA. Exercise in individuals with OSA is associated with lower levels of depression, fatigue, blood pressure and CRP.

40|$|Objectives: This diploma thesis briefly {{summarizes}} the current {{knowledge about the}} neurophysiological and functional somatosensory influence of <b>sedentary</b> and non-sedentary <b>occupations</b> on the individual. The experimental part compares the quality of somatognostic functions in cohorts with <b>sedentary</b> <b>occupations</b> (SO) versus non-sedentary occupations (NSO). The NSO group positions and movements often alternate and static positions are not held for long periods. Methods: Both groups had {{the same number of}} probands. Ore-emptive questionnaires provided anamnestic data for each individual. Afterwards, somatosensory functions were assessed using six selected tests; 2 tests for upper extremity proprioception (UEP), 2 tests for lower extremity proprioception (LEP) and 2 tests for body size perception. Results: There was {{a significant difference in the}} results of the four tests measuring quality of proprioception of the upper and lower extremities. The NSO group showed more accurate results. In the UEP test measured in sitting posture, there was an average deviation 4, 4 ř in the SO group, and 3, 1 ř in the NSO group (p = 0, 021). In the UEP test measured in standing posture, there was an average deviation 4. 0 cm in the SO group, and 3, 0 cm in the NSO group (p = 0. 025). In the LEP test measured in standing posture, [...] ...|$|R
