5|$|Although {{never truly}} domesticated, {{a small number}} of jungle cats have been found among the cat mummies of Ancient Egypt, dating to 3700 BC. The vast {{majority}} of these are domestic cats, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> may have been used to help control rodent populations.|$|E
50|$|In {{part two}} Metlitzki explores key English medieval texts and <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> either are based entirely on Arabic stories or include {{elements}} from Arabic storytelling <b>that</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had been {{loosely based on}} Arabic stories.|$|R
50|$|As {{their sons}} grew up, they {{soon began to}} grow tired {{of living in a}} cramped up space, forever in darkness. One brother, Tūmatūenga, the God of War and Humans, <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> slay their parents. However, his brother, Tāne, the God of Forests, <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{separate}} their parents forever.|$|R
50|$|These discoveries have {{produced}} an alternative {{model for the}} origin of the brachiopods; it <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> evolved by the reduction of sessile tube-like organisms, until only two shells were left. This contrasts with the brachiopod fold hypothesis which <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> formed by the folding of a halkieriid-like organism.|$|R
5|$|Hence, the Pyramid Texts of {{the pyramid}} of Unas {{incorporate}} instructions for ritual actions and words to be spoken, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were precisely those performed and recited during {{the cult of the}} king in his mortuary temple.|$|E
5|$|The fossil {{material}} of A. longicervia {{was subjected to}} chemical analysis for oleanane, considered a key marker differentiating angiosperms from gymnosperms. Oleanane was detected in these specimens, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> belong to the angiosperms.|$|E
5|$|At {{the bottom}} of the hill beside the battery are two {{rectangular}} earthworks, 16 metres by 8 metres (52ft and 26ft), and 26 metres and 12 metres (85ft and 39ft). Traditionally these have been thought to be Royalist gun batteries pre-dating the construction of Oliver's Battery, but recent scholarship casts doubt on this, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are instead the remains of hollow ways and sand pits.|$|E

5|$|By contrast, of 393 men {{sentenced to}} death for falling asleep on sentry duty in all theatres in World War I, only two were {{executed}} (sentries were usually posted in pairs to keep one another awake; these two, who served in Mesopotamia, were made an example of because they were found sitting asleep together, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had colluded).|$|E
5|$|Potbelly {{sculpture}}s from Sin Cabezas are stylistically {{related to}} Olmec sculpture but were reused by later peoples, being found in fill {{dating to the}} Late Classic period. The monuments at Sin Cabezas were headless when they were found and no fragments of the missing heads were evident, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had already been damaged when they were re-erected by later occupants of the site.|$|E
5|$|The {{filaments}} exhibit random {{orientations and}} are often wavy, which has been interpreted as evidence that they were soft and pliable in life. Microscopic examination shows that individual filaments appear dark along the edges and light internally, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were hollow, like modern feathers. Compared to modern mammals the filaments were quite coarse, with each individual strand much larger and thicker than the corresponding hairs of similarly sized mammals.|$|E

5|$|American kestrels' {{response}} to environmental stress is measured as blood concentration of corticosterone (CORT,) a hormone {{produced by the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis that releases stored energy for essential body functions. Extended periods of elevated blood CORT levels may direct metabolic energy away from growth and reproduction. Thus, high levels of traffic disturbance and human development surrounding American kestrel nests are found to increase stress hormones leading to reproductive failure. Among successful nests, however, nestlings do not typically experience a higher stress {{response to}} environmental human disturbance, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can tolerate a considerable degree of human activity near the nest.|$|E
5|$|Analyses of extinct adapiforms postcranial skeletons {{suggest a}} variety of {{locomotor}} behavior. The European adapids Adapis, Palaeolemur, and Leptadapis shared adaptations for slow climbing like the lorises, although {{they may have been}} quadrupedal runners like small New World monkeys. Both Notharctus and Smilodectes from North America and Europolemur from Europe exhibit limb proportions and joint surfaces comparable to vertical clinging and leaping lemurs, but were not as specialized as indriids for vertical clinging, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> ran along branches and did not leap as much. Notharctids Cantius and Pronycticebus appear to have been agile arboreal quadrupeds, with adaptations comparable to the brown lemurs.|$|E
5|$|At {{the climax}} of the film, to Tommy's horror the tree finally dies just before arrival, as Izzy had also died just before a cure. A final {{apparition}} of Izzi appears, comforting Tommy in the face of his accepted impending death and <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> may share an afterlife now. He finally understands and embraces his death, moments before the star goes supernova, engulfing the ship and everything within. The traveler's body is absorbed, but the tree flourishes back to life being engulfed by the star dying inside the nebula. Izzi's apparition picks a fruit from the new tree of life and hands it to Tom, the present-day neuroscientist, who plants it in Izzi's grave.|$|E

5|$|Baleen whales have a small, yet functional, vomeronasal organ. This allows baleen whales {{to detect}} {{chemicals}} and pheromones released by their prey. It {{is thought that}} 'tasting' the water is important for finding prey and tracking down other whales. They {{are believed to have}} an impaired sense of smell {{due to the lack of}} the olfactory bulb, but they do have an olfactory tract. Baleen whales have few if any taste buds, suggesting they have lost their sense of taste. They do retain salt-receptor taste-buds <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can taste saltiness.|$|E
5|$|During the Eocene, rodents {{began to}} diversify. Beavers {{appeared}} in North America {{in the late}} Eocene before spreading to Eurasia. Late in the Eocene, hystricognaths invaded Africa, most probably having originated in Asia at least 39.5 million years ago. From Africa, fossil evidence shows that some hystricognaths (caviomorphs) , which was an isolated continent at the time, evidently making use of ocean currents to cross the Atlantic on floating debris. Caviomorphs had arrived in South America by 41 million years ago (implying a date at least {{as early as this}} for hystricognaths in Africa), and had reached the Greater Antilles by the early Oligocene, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> must have dispersed rapidly across South America.|$|E
5|$|It is not {{understood}} how the activated RISC complex locates complementary mRNAs within the cell. Although the cleavage {{process has been}} proposed {{to be linked to}} translation, translation of the mRNA target is not essential for RNAi-mediated degradation. Indeed, RNAi may be more effective against mRNA targets that are not translated. Argonaute proteins are localized to specific regions in the cytoplasm called P-bodies (also cytoplasmic bodies or GW bodies), which are regions with high rates of mRNA decay; miRNA activity is also clustered in P-bodies. Disruption of P-bodies decreases the efficiency of RNA interference, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are a critical site in the RNAi process.|$|E

5|$|On 8 March 1945, Soviet-controlled Hungarian radio {{announced}} that Wallenberg and his driver {{had been murdered}} {{on their way to}} Debrecen, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had been killed by the Arrow Cross Party or the Gestapo. Sweden's foreign minister, Östen Undén, and its ambassador to the Soviet Union, Staffan Söderblom, wrongly assumed that they were dead. In April 1945, W. Averell Harriman, then of the U.S. State Department, offered the Swedish government help in inquiring about Wallenberg's fate, but the offer was declined. Söderblom met with Vyacheslav Molotov and Stalin in Moscow on 15 June 1946. Söderblom, still believing Wallenberg to be dead, ignored talk of an exchange for Russian defectors in Sweden.|$|E
5|$|On 9 October 1941, President Roosevelt {{approved}} the atomic program after he convened {{a meeting with}} Vannevar Bush and Vice President Henry A. Wallace. To control the program, he created a Top Policy Group consisting of himself—although he never attended a meeting—Wallace, Bush, Conant, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, and the Chief of Staff of the Army, General George C. Marshall. Roosevelt chose the Army to run the project rather than the Navy, because the Army had more experience with management of large-scale construction projects. He also agreed to coordinate the effort {{with that of the}} British, and on 11 October he sent a message to Prime Minister Winston Churchill, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> correspond on atomic matters.|$|E
5|$|Reich– who {{had known}} Hoyle since the late 1990s– was in the audience, and enjoyed the {{chemistry}} between the two actors, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> appear in a feature film together. Over {{the course of a}} day, he filmed three shorts starring Hoyle and Ryder, in which they explored some of the scenarios and themes that made it into Uncle David. In these shorts Hoyle wore a wig and makeup, which were omitted from the later feature. The two actors continued to develop their characters through a series of text messages and phone conversations.|$|E
