5|$|On the {{completion}} of his extra year learning Arabic at Oxford, <b>Seamer</b> joined the Sudan Political Service. He continued to play cricket for Somerset during his periods of leave, but it dramatically reduced his availability for the county. During his time at Oxford, <b>Seamer</b> had become good friends with Mitchell-Innes; the pair both attended the same college, and played together for both the university and Somerset. When Mitchell-Innes graduated from Oxford the year after <b>Seamer,</b> he joined his friend in the Sudan, where the pair often organised cricket matches, despite the extreme heat. Seamer's duties prevented him from playing for Somerset at all during 1937, but he appeared eight times the following year through May and early June. His average that season was the highest he achieved after leaving university, recording 20.78 from his 14 innings, though his highest score was 47 runs, scored against Derbyshire. In 1939, the last season of first-class county cricket in England before the Second World War, <b>Seamer</b> played seven times for Somerset. However, unlike his appearances the previous year, {{in which he had}} generally batted as part of the top order, <b>Seamer</b> predominantly appeared in the middle order for the county in 1939, and his highest score was 28.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most amateurs of the time, <b>Seamer</b> prioritised {{defensive}} {{play when}} batting; {{he watched the}} ball and minimised the risks, valuing his own wicket. This careful style was exemplified by his innings in the University match of 1934, when he helped Oxford salvage a draw by batting for two hours with the tail, during which time he scored 24 runs. Despite his circumspect batting technique, <b>Seamer</b> enjoyed his cricket, and in a more relaxed setting he once scored a century before lunch: playing in the Sudan, the match started at {{seven in the morning}} to avoid the worst of the heat. Before their opponent's innings, <b>Seamer</b> and his team-mates got them drunk to improve their chances of a win.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} between graduating from Marlborough College and {{going up to}} Oxford University, <b>Seamer</b> made his county cricket debut, playing three matches for Somerset County Cricket Club. In his first match for Somerset, played against Derbyshire, he played as a {{specialist}} batsman at number eight in the batting order. He came in to bat when Somerset had lost six wickets for the addition of 88 runs, and together with his captain, Reggie Ingle, helped Somerset to recover. The pair put on a partnership of 104 runs, and <b>Seamer</b> scored 70 runs in his debut innings. In both his other matches for the county that season, <b>Seamer</b> batted {{as part of the}} top order, and though he reached double figures in each of his innings, he did not achieve another half-century.|$|E
25|$|Notable spinners include Shakib Al Hasan and Abdur Razzak and <b>seamers</b> like Mashrafe Mortaza.|$|R

50|$|The {{pitch is}} bowler friendly. <b>Seamers</b> benefit {{in the morning}} {{because of the high}} water table and heavy sweating. Spinners benefit in the {{afternoon}} when the pitch can crumble.|$|R
5|$|Following his {{graduation}} from Marlborough College, <b>Seamer</b> attended Brasenose College, Oxford. <b>Seamer</b> played just one first-class {{match for the}} university in his first year, appearing against Worcestershire at The Parks. He scored 33 before being run out in his only innings, and also bowled six overs, though without claiming a wicket. He appeared eleven times for Somerset that year, but despite regular scores of 20 or more, he did not score a half-century, and averaged 13.06 runs.|$|E
5|$|Horse remains {{dating from}} 10,500–8,000BC have been {{recovered}} from Sewell's Cave, Flixton, <b>Seamer</b> Carr, Uxbridge and Thatcham. Remains dating from around 7,000BC {{have been found in}} Gough's Cave in Cheddar.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} year at Oxford, <b>Seamer</b> played {{as part of a}} strong batting line-up for the university: Fredrick de Saram passed 1,000 runs for the side, while Mandy Mitchell-Innes fell just two runs short of the landmark. <b>Seamer,</b> despite scoring over three hundred runs less than either, {{finished}} second in the batting averages for the year with 51.76. He scored three centuries for the university, passing one hundred runs against the Free Foresters, the Minor Counties and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). His score of 194, made against the Free Foresters was the highest first-class total of Seamer's career, and the three centuries he scored during 1934 were remarkable for the fact that he only scored one other first-class century during his career. <b>Seamer</b> earned his cricketing Blue in 1934, appearing in the University match against Cambridge University. He was dismissed for a duck in the first innings, but batted with resolve in the second. He remained at the crease with the tail for over two hours, eventually being not out on 24, to help Oxford force a draw. <b>Seamer</b> found batting more difficult in the County Championship: in thirteen innings for Somerset in 1934, he passed 50 once, against Kent, and averaged 16.81, significantly lower than his total for Oxford.|$|E
25|$|Seam bowling is {{a phrase}} {{used for a}} bowling {{technique}} in cricket whereby the ball is deliberately bowled on to its seam, to cause a random deviation. Practitioners are known as seam bowlers or <b>seamers.</b>|$|R
50|$|He {{remained}} a consistent wicket-taker through the 1990s, renowned for his fitness and {{the accuracy of}} his left arm <b>seamers.</b> In eleven seasons he took over 500 first-class wickets for Northamptonshire, until his release in 2001.|$|R
50|$|Chohan was {{included}} in Canada's squad for the World Cup Qualifiers in South Africa in early 2009 and proved one of their more consistent bowlers, picking up 15 wickets {{in the course of}} the tournament. He is mainly known for his fast-medium <b>seamers.</b>|$|R
5|$|Rajesh Vivek as Guran (<b>seamer),</b> {{the fortune}} teller. Vivek was spotted by Ashutosh {{in the film}} Junoon (1978). His liking for cricket helped him in his role.|$|E
5|$|<b>Seamer</b> {{graduated}} in 1935, but returned to Oxford {{for a further}} year to study Arabic. In his final year of cricket at Oxford, he only appeared in three matches: he was not required to bat in either innings against the Free Foresters, and only batted once against Leicestershire, scoring 5 runs. Out of form and not required for the university team, {{he went off to}} play for Somerset in the match against Cambridge University and scored 68. He followed that with a further game for Somerset in which he was not successful and travelled with the Somerset side for the next match against Glamorgan at Llanelli, but Mitchell-Innes, as Oxford captain, called him up as cover for the injured Roger Kimpton; {{on the morning of the}} match, The Times reported that Kimpton was likely to play and <b>Seamer</b> would be stood down. In the event, Kimpton failed his fitness test and Seamer's final match for the university team was the University match against Cambridge, and as in the previous year, Oxford suffered a heavy defeat. <b>Seamer</b> scored 11 runs in the first innings, and then when Oxford were asked to follow on, he batted tenaciously to reach 43 runs, which forced Cambridge to bat again. Requiring 17 runs to win, Cambridge chased the total down in 5.4 overs with eight wickets to spare. In total, <b>Seamer</b> played 21 matches for Oxford, scoring 1,059 runs at an average of 35.30.|$|E
5|$|<b>Seamer</b> married Letice Dorothy Lee, {{and had two}} children, Katherine Judith and Mary. By 1948 <b>Seamer</b> {{had risen}} to be the {{district}} commissioner for Khartoum North. When he left the Sudan Political Service in 1950, he returned to England and took up a teaching position at his old school, Marlborough College. In addition to teaching Latin, English and history, he became a housemaster, before his retirement in 1973. He served as mayor of Marlborough twice, and as a justice of the peace, and was awarded Freedom of the City in 2001. He died, following an illness on 16 April 2006, aged 92.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} renowned as a <b>seamers</b> wicket, {{and there is}} also a famous myth {{regarding}} how the tide affects batting conditions, as the ground is quite close to the beach. Many batting collapses in matches in the past have jokingly been blamed on changes in the tide.|$|R
50|$|The Bay Side Canning Company {{plant at}} Alviso started {{operations}} with primitive canning methods and equipment, of which most was hand-made. Steam was supplied by old, donkey-type boilers; open vats {{were used in}} processing fruits and vegetables. Hand <b>seamers</b> and hand soldering were used in canning the processed food.|$|R
50|$|Walker {{was born}} in Bristol, but educated partly in South Africa. A tall {{right-handed}} middle-order batsman, a left-arm bowler who varied his pace between medium-paced <b>seamers</b> and slow spinners, and a spectacularly good close catcher, specialising in fielding at short-leg, he played all his county cricket for Glamorgan.|$|R
5|$|<b>Seamer</b> {{scored the}} last of his four {{first-class}} centuries in 1935, his third year at Oxford and his fourth of ten seasons of first-class cricket. The hundred, like all his previous ones, was scored for the university; he reached 113 runs in the second innings of a defeat to Surrey. <b>Seamer</b> struggled for runs in his other matches for the university that year, and in the contest against Cambridge, he scored four and three in a game which Cambridge won easily. In nine innings for Somerset that season, he never scored more than 17 runs and averaged 7.11.|$|E
5|$|Daya Shankar Pandey as Goli (<b>seamer),</b> the {{man with}} the largest piece of land. Pandey, who {{preferred}} the role of Kachra, was known to Aamir and Ashutosh through previous films (Pehla Nasha (1993), Baazi (1995) and Ghulam (1998)). Pandey credited Ashutosh for his acting in the film, saying that Ashutosh and he would discuss the required emotions and expressions before shooting.|$|E
5|$|Raghubir Yadav as Bhura (<b>seamer),</b> {{the poultry}} farmer. Yadav {{played the role}} of the legendary Haji Nasruddin in the teleplay Mullah Nasiruddin and has given many memorable {{performances}} such as Mungerilal Ke Haseen Sapne. Yadav was selected based on his performance in Earth (1998). He had undergone an appendectomy operation in-between the filming schedule and returned to complete some of his scenes.|$|E
50|$|A {{right-handed}} middle order batsman and a right-arm medium pace bowler, Bainbridge was {{an important}} member of the Gloucestershire team throughout the 1980s, contributing useful runs, initially at No 5 or 6, and bowling deceptively innocuous-looking medium pace <b>seamers.</b> A determined cricketer, he seemed to make runs and take wickets when most needed.|$|R
50|$|He {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Lancashire County Cricket Club in 1987 (having played a single Sunday League match {{for them the}} previous season) and remained with that county for his entire career, scoring 3,778 runs at 27.98 and taking 262 wickets at 30.35 with his medium-pace <b>seamers</b> in his 124 matches.|$|R
50|$|He was {{elevated}} him to {{the national}} squad. There, however, he struggled to hold his place, as Bangladesh already had two other left arm <b>seamers,</b> Gholam Nousher and Jahangir Alam Talukdar. Anisur's career was also hampered by injuries and No-Ball problem. Still, he briefly emerged in 1994, following the retirement of Prince and Dulu, as the country's top pace bowler.|$|R
5|$|<b>Seamer</b> did {{not appear}} again for Somerset after his period as captain in 1948. In total for the county, he scored 1,405 runs {{at an average of}} 15.61. He made his final {{first-class}} appearance the following season, appearing for the Free Foresters against Oxford University. He later made three Minor Counties Championship appearances for Wiltshire in 1956, though without much success.|$|E
5|$|<b>Seamer</b> {{played the}} best of his cricket while at Oxford University. All four of his {{first-class}} centuries were made for the university side, and his average for Oxford was 35.30, significantly higher than his career average of 20.35. He made his highest score against Free Foresters in his second year, during which he accrued 858 runs, more than double he managed in any other season. On completion of his studies at Oxford, <b>Seamer</b> joined the Sudan Political Service, which limited his first-class cricket appearances to periods of leave. He was named as one of three amateurs to captain Somerset in 1948, leading the team during June and July. That season was his last for Somerset, and he made only one further first-class appearance. He became a district commissioner in the Sudan, and after leaving the service, he taught at Marlborough College and was twice mayor of Marlborough.|$|E
5|$|Bradman {{returned}} {{to lead the}} Australians in the next match against Surrey at The Oval in London; Australia won the toss and batted first. Sid Barnes and Arthur Morris put on 136, before Bradman and Barnes put on another 207 before the opener fell for 176. Hassett came in and Bradman was dismissed for 146 at 3/403. Hassett struck form and reached his first century for the English summer, posting 110 before being clean bowled by Test <b>seamer</b> Alec Bedser as Australia were bowled out for 632. Bedser pitched an outswinger on leg stump and it moved away to clip Hassett's off stump. Bradman’s men then bowled Surrey out for 141 and 195 to win by an innings.|$|E
50|$|South Africa {{went into}} the {{historic}} match with four front-line <b>seamers</b> and no spinner, selecting the same side that had drawn their last test, with Australia. England made two changes from the drawn test with New Zealand, John Crawley coming into the side to make his debut {{at the expense of}} Robin Smith and Ian Salisbury replacing Peter Such as the side's spinner.|$|R
25|$|Cricket's bowlers {{are grouped}} into {{different}} categories {{based on their}} bowling style—pacemen, <b>seamers,</b> off-spinners (or finger-spinners), leg-spinners (or wrist-spinners)—though a bowler may fall into more than one category (pace and seam bowling, for instance, largely overlap). The faster bowlers usually open the bowling, when the ball is at its hardest and smoothest. Spin bowlers generally bowl later, when the ball has begun to deteriorate and become rough.|$|R
25|$|Grant Flower {{was born}} in Salisbury, Rhodesia and was educated along with his brother Andy at North Park School where they were {{the best players in}} their age groups. Although always an allrounder, he bowled <b>seamers</b> in his early days and his bowling was rated more than his batting. It was in high school, at St. George's College where he changed to spin bowling.|$|R
5|$|While at Oxford, Mitchell-Innes {{had become}} {{good friends with}} Jake <b>Seamer,</b> who had also {{attended}} Brasenose College, and the pair were teammates for both Oxford and Somerset. <b>Seamer</b> had joined the Sudan Political Service (SPS) on his graduation in 1936, and while at Oxford, Mitchell-Innes also secured a role with the organisation {{that he would take}} up after his graduation. His duties with the SPS prevented him from playing for Somerset at all during 1938, but he made seven early-season appearances the following year, though two were for the Marylebone Cricket Club and the Free Foresters. It was for the latter of these that Mitchell-Innes made his only century of the season; playing against Oxford University, the Free Foresters required nearly 400 runs in the fourth innings to win. Mitchell-Innes opened the innings, and after the lunch interval on the final day he played attacking cricket, bringing up his century in 95 minutes. He was eventually dismissed for 143 runs, bowled as he tried to heave an on drive. The Free Foresters came within nine runs of their target, but were bowled out before they could reach it. In total, he scored 347 runs at 31.54 that year; the last season of first-class county cricket in England before it was interrupted by the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|With {{the series}} already lost, England made four changes to their team. Dewes {{replaced}} the injured Washbrook, while Watkins replaced Cranston as an all-rounder. Both Dewes and Watkins were making their Test debut. England played two spinners; Young replaced fellow finger spinner Laker, while the leg spin of Hollies replaced Pollard's pace. The selectors were widely condemned for their incessant changes. Australia made three changes. Off spinner Johnson {{was replaced by}} the leg spin of Ring. Australia's second change was forced on them; the injured <b>seamer</b> Toshack {{was replaced by the}} recovered batsman Barnes. The final change was the return of wicket-keeper Tallon from injury.|$|E
5|$|Australia's bowling {{attack was}} led by Lindwall and Miller, who took the new ball in the Tests. Bradman used the pair in short and fiery bursts with the new ball. English cricket administrators had agreed {{to make a new}} ball {{available}} every 55 overs; at the time, the norm was to allow a new ball for every 200 runs scored, something that usually took longer than 55 overs. The new regulation played directly {{into the hands of the}} Australians, as a new ball is ideal for fast bowling and the tourists had a vastly superior pace attack. Bradman thus wanted to preserve his two first-choice pacemen for a vigorous attack on the English batsmen every 55 overs. As a result, Australia's third fast bowler Bill Johnston bowled the most overs, and the left arm <b>seamer</b> Ernie Toshack also had a heavy workload until a knee injury ended his campaign.|$|E
25|$|For West Indies, Brian Lara {{had retired}} from all cricket {{at the end}} of the World Cup, and Ramnaresh Sarwan {{replaced}} him as captain for this series. Lendl Simmons had been dropped since the tour of Pakistan, and Devon Smith and Sylvester Joseph entered the squad as specialist batsmen. Spinners Omari Banks and Dave Mohammed had been left out for <b>seamers</b> Ravi Rampaul and Darren Sammy.|$|R
