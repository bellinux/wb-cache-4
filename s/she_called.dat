She discussed the Lakefield sketches as backgrounds for the tale with Warne. He proposed a large format volume similar to L.

5|$|Ecstatic {{with her}} blessings, Satyavati gave birth {{the same day}} to her baby on {{an island in the}} Yamuna. The son {{immediately}} grew up as a youth and promised his mother that he would come to her aid every time <b>she</b> <b>called</b> on him; he then left to do penance in the forest. The son was called Krishna ("the dark one") due to his colour, or Dvaipayana ("one born on an island") and would later become known as Vyasa – compiler of the Vedas and author of the Puranas and the Mahabharata, fulfilling Parashara's prophecy.

5|$|Heyer {{specialised}} in {{two types}} of romantic male leads, which <b>she</b> <b>called</b> Mark I and Mark II. Mark I, with overtones of Mr Rochester, was (in her words) “rude, overbearing, and often a bounder”. Mark II by contrast was debonair, sophisticated, and often a style-icon. Similarly, her heroines (reflecting Austen's division between lively and gentle) fell into two broad groups: the tall and dashing, mannish type, and the quiet bullied type.|$|E

5|$|In the 1995 {{compilation}} Children and the Politics of Culture, anthropologist Vivienne Wee {{analyzed the}} perception of children by adults and how it supported the concept of children's rights. Wee wrote that in this model (which <b>she</b> <b>called</b> the European pattern), children were seen as defenseless, unadulterated, {{and in need of}} protection by authoritative adults. According to Wee, this European pattern led to the idea that children required the sanctuary of the United Nations Charter and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.|$|E
