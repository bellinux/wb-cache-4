50|$|<b>Sinus</b> <b>barotrauma</b> or {{aerosinusitis}} {{has been}} known since the early development of aviation medicine. However, it was during World War II that the subject first received serious attention and the pathogenesis of the disease was understood {{to be due to}} exposure to high altitude flights. Rapid altitude changes with accompanying changes in ambient pressure exposed the aircrews to an increasing number of episodes of <b>sinus</b> <b>barotrauma.</b>|$|E
50|$|Aerosinusitis, {{also called}} barosinusitis, sinus squeeze or <b>sinus</b> <b>barotrauma</b> is a painful {{inflammation}} and sometimes bleeding of the membrane of the paranasal sinus cavities, normally the frontal sinus. It {{is caused by}} a difference in air pressures inside and outside the cavities.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of episodes of <b>sinus</b> <b>barotrauma</b> {{occur in the}} frontal sinuses with pain localized over the frontal area. Possible explanations for {{this might be the}} relatively long and delicate nasofrontal duct that connects the narrow frontal recess with the frontal sinuses.|$|E
5000|$|Weissman defined three {{grades of}} <b>sinus</b> <b>barotraumas</b> {{according}} to symptomatology.|$|R
25|$|Divers {{must avoid}} {{injuries}} caused {{by changes in}} pressure. The weight of the water column above the diver causes an increase in pressure in proportion to depth, {{in the same way}} that the weight of the column of atmospheric air above the surface causes a pressure of 101.3 kPa (14.7 pounds-force per square inch) at sea level. This variation of pressure with depth will cause compressible materials and gas filled spaces to tend to change volume, which can cause the surrounding material or tissues to be stressed, with the risk of injury if the stress gets too high. Pressure injuries are called barotrauma and can be quite painful, even potentially fatal – in severe cases causing a ruptured lung, eardrum or damage to the <b>sinuses.</b> To avoid <b>barotrauma,</b> the diver equalises the pressure in all air spaces with the surrounding water pressure when changing depth. The middle ear and sinus are equalised using one or more of several techniques, which is referred to as clearing the ears.|$|R
50|$|Typically, <b>sinus</b> <b>barotrauma</b> is {{preceded by}} an upper {{respiratory}} tract infection or allergy. The affected person suffers a sudden sharp facial pain or headache during descent, which increases as the aircraft approaches ground level. The pain can ultimately become disabling unless the ambient pressure is reversed.|$|E
50|$|The {{pathology}} of <b>sinus</b> <b>barotrauma</b> {{is directly}} related to Boyle's law, which states that the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to the pressure on it, when temperature is constant (P1 × V1 = P2 × V2).Two types of acute barotrauma are observed: squeeze and reverse squeeze.|$|E
50|$|In {{most cases}} of <b>sinus</b> <b>barotrauma,</b> {{localized}} pain to the frontal {{area is the}} predominant symptom. This is due to pain originating from the frontal sinus, it being above the brow bones. Less common is pain referred to the temporal, occipital, or retrobulbar region. Epistaxis or serosanguineous secretion from the nose may occur. Neurological symptoms may affect the adjacent fifth cranial nerve and especially the infraorbital nerve.|$|E
50|$|Mild {{cases of}} {{barotrauma}} are readily treated by topical decongestants and painkillers. In severe cases or cases resistant to local treatment, functional endoscopic sinus surgery is indicated {{in order to}} re-establish drainage and ventilation of the sinuses. This treatment has shown good results in aviators suffering from recurrent <b>sinus</b> <b>barotrauma.</b> Computer-aided surgery has re-established the drainage of affected sinuses, {{especially with regard to}} the sphenoid sinuses. When the sphenoids were entered endoscopically, mucosal petechia and hematoma were clearly seen.|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose: To {{study the}} MRI {{findings}} of otic and <b>sinus</b> <b>barotrauma</b> {{in patients with}} carbon monoxide(CO) poisoning during hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy and examine the discrepancies of otic and sinus abnormalities on MRI between barotrauma and acute otitis media with effusion. Materials and Methods: Eighty patients with CO-poisoning diagnosed with otic and <b>sinus</b> <b>barotrauma</b> after HBO therapy were recruited. Brain MRI was performed to predict delayed encephalopathy. Over the same period, 88 patients with acute otitis media with effusion on MRI served as control. The abnormalities {{of the middle ear}} and paranasal sinuses on MRI were noted and were compared between groups. Nine patients with barotrauma were followed up by MRI. Results: In the barotrauma group, 92. 5 % of patients had bilateral middle ear abnormalities on MRI, and 60 % of patients had both middle ear cavity and mastoid cavity abnormalities on MRI in both ears. Both rates were higher than those in the control group (p = 0. 000). In the two groups, most abnormalities on MRI were observed in the mastoid cavity. The rate of sinus abnormalities of barotrauma was 66. 3 %, which was higher than the 50 % in the control group (p = 0. 033). In the nine patients with barotrauma followed up by MRI, the otic barotrauma and sinus abnormalities had worsened in 2 patients and 5 patients, respectively. Conclusion: MRI is able to depict the abnormalities of otic and <b>sinus</b> <b>barotrauma</b> in patients with CO-poisoning during HBO therapy and to differentiate these from acute otitis media with effusion...|$|E

40|$|Summary: We {{present the}} case of a flight {{passenger}} who expe-rienced acute and severe headache during landing. MR imaging was performed because the patient had a history of vascular malformation and revealed an incidental venous angioma. A mass lesion in the frontal sinus, consistent with submucosal hematoma secondary to barotrauma, was thought to be the cause of the headache. To our knowledge, this is the first case of <b>sinus</b> <b>barotrauma</b> described in the radiologic literature and the first to describe the associated MR imaging findings. Sinonasal barotrauma is caused by a rapid change of ambient pressure. In the presence of compromise to the normal sinus outflow, a pressure gradient oc-curs, which is the basic cause of the traumatic event. Divers and aviators are the two main populations that are affected by barotrauma. Radiologic correlation...|$|E
40|$|The {{headache}} {{attributed to}} airplane travel, also named "airplane headache", {{is characterized by}} the sudden onset of a severe head pain exclusively in relation to airplane flights, mainly during the landing phase. Secondary causes, such as upper respiratory tract infections or acute sinusitis, must be ruled out. Although its cause is not thoroughly understood, <b>sinus</b> <b>barotrauma</b> should be reasonably involved in the pathophysiological mechanisms. Furthermore, in the current International Classification of Headache Disorders, rapid descent from high altitude is not considered as a possible cause of headache, although the onset of such pain in airplane travellers or aviators has been well known {{since the beginning of the}} aviation era. On the basis of a survey we conducted with the courteous cooperation of people who had experienced this type of headache, we proposed diagnostic criteria to be added to the forthcoming revision of the International Classification of Headache Disorders. Their formal validation would favour further studies aimed at improving knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved and at implementing preventative measures...|$|E
40|$|Patients {{presenting}} before flight with {{an upper}} respiratory infection {{are at risk}} for aerosinusitis. Prophylaxis of this condition consists of an oral decongestant before flight and nasal decongestant spray during the flight just prior to descent. Evaluation of the patient presenting with aerosinusitis consists of a careful physical exam with emphasis on diagnosing treatable nasal and sinus pathology. Categorization of the patient into the Weissman classification is important for determining prognostic factors for recovery. Management of this condition is based on the Weissman stage. Stage I or II lesions are generally treated conservatively with a 1 -wk course of topical sprays, analgesics, a tapering course of steroids, and oral decongestants. Use of antibiotics is reserved for those cases initiated by bacterial sinusitis. Additionally, antihistamines are reserved for cases where allergies were the inciting cause. Stage III lesions are rarely seen in civilian air travelers due to the relatively low fluctuations in ambient air pressure. Aircrew that suffer Stage III aerosinusitis {{are at risk for}} recurrent <b>sinus</b> <b>barotrauma</b> that may require an expertly performed functional endoscopic sinus surgery to successfully manage it.
