Calculation of the actual quantity to convey was made using a table of reference exchange rates maintained by the company, reflecting current actual exchange rates published by exchange providers.|$|E

40|$|Conventional wisdom has it {{that network}} effects are strong in markets for {{homogeneous}} goods, leading to the dominance of one <b>settlement</b> <b>currency</b> in such markets. The alleged dominance of the dollar in global oil markets is said to epitomize this phenomenon. We question this presumption with evidence for earlier periods showing that several national currencies have simultaneously played substantial roles in global oil markets. European oil import payments before and after World War II were split between the dollar and non-dollar currencies, mainly sterling. Differences in use of the dollar across countries were associated with trade linkages with the United States {{and the size of}} the importing country. That several national currencies could simultaneously play a role in international oil settlements suggests that a shift from the current dollar-based system toward a multi-polar system in the period ahead is not impossible...|$|E

In the selection of the RMB exchange rate index, we can learn from the existing literature that the nominal exchange rate and the effective exchange rate are the most common indices that are selected for sample data. A study conducted by Bodnar and Gentry (1993) found that although the real exchange rate eliminated the inflation rate, the market could not respond in a timely fashion to the changes in real exchange rates. In fact, the market was more sensitive to the changes in the nominal exchange rate. In addition, considering that the U.S. dollar is China’s major foreign trade <b>settlement</b> <b>currency</b> and dollar reserves {{play an important role in}} China’s foreign exchange reserve, we selected the RMB/US dollar nominal exchange rate (denoted by PER) as the sample index exchange rate, and the sample data were obtained from the SAFE website (www.safe.gov.cn).|$|E

The list of prerequisites is said to include (a) a deep and liquid domestic financial market, including vibrant government and corporate bond markets, (b) capital account convertibility, (c) a flexible nominal exchange rate regime, (d) a stable domestic macroeconomic situation including low inflation and a government debt level within a sustainable threshold.

40|$|The Chinese currency, Renminbi Yuan (RMB), has had {{restricted}} convertibility {{outside the}} mainland, namely in Hong Kong, from early 2004. From July 2009, much wider convertibility has been permitted, with the RMB {{being used as}} a cross-border trade <b>settlement</b> <b>currency.</b> This paper attempts to assess the factors that have motivated RMB internationalisation, and the role Hong Kong has played in the process, against the background of China’s evolving foreign exchange markets and the RMB exchange rate benchmarking to the Hong Kong market. It shows that China’s ultimate goal of full convertibility of the capital account has provided the underlying motivation for RMB internationalisation, and that the 2008 global financial crisis acted as a catalyst in the process. With the political blessing of the central authorities and its extensive business and financial links with the mainland, Hong Kong has gradually established an RMB offshore market to supplement capital account liberalisations on the Mainland. The prospects for RMB internationalisation will be determined by the growth of the Chinese economy, reinforcing flows of RMB funds between the offshore Hong Kong and onshore Shanghai markets, and the balanced development of these two markets.

40|$|The {{squeeze in}} United States dollar {{liquidity}} that emerged {{with the global}} financial crisis highlighted the risks inherent in the current global financial system. Asia was adversely affected by the crisis {{not only because of}} its dependence on trade, but also because of its heavy reliance on the US dollar for regional and international transactions. As Asia's role in the global economy continues to expand, its dependence on the US dollar is bound to increase, raising further its vulnerability to future liquidity shocks. The use of regional currencies for bilateral trade settlement could reduce such vulnerability. As demonstrated by the renminbi trade settlement scheme piloted between the People's Republic of China; Hong Kong, China; and Macao, China, the existence of appropriate financial infrastructure could reduce the relatively larger costs of bilateral currency transactions compared with triangular transactions through the United States dollar. As most central banks are securities depositories of government bonds, combining trade settlement with government bond securities settlement could also have large synergy effects without substantial extra costs. This proposal does not require full liberalization of the capital account or full deregulation of capital markets, and is more politically feasible in transition. As such, extending the trade settlement scheme to the rest of Asia and appending a government bond payment and securities settlement system could be a practical solution to international monetary system reform and the diversification of <b>settlement</b> <b>currencies...</b>|$|R

40|$|Portfolio space (first time {{published}} at [1]) {{enables us}} to formalize economic activities in bookkeeping framework. In paper [2] author has defined production vector Y and new type of asset A 2, that represent human work done during production of one new product. In paper [3] portfolio play was enriched about relative price of money interest rate and also unit labor cost was introduced. Some restriction on fraction demand / supply was introduced. Income constraint was main tool during the proof. In this paper author has defined key vectors of international trade. So vectors of exchange of goods EX (stands for export of goods) and 1 M (representing import of goods) were defined. Again vectors specify relative price of one piece of goods or money vis-a-vis another convertible currency. Vector EXR describes exchange of two currencies. Again small letters {{are used in the}} case of scalars. These types of variables express the whole real volume ofthese particular foreign trade deals. In this paper author takes into accounts only 3 countries (players) because it on the one hand {{enables us to}} introduce flow matrix among countries {{and on the other hand}} this little set of indices is easier and shorter for description. Flow matrix represents only flow of goods in real terms. (Dual flows of moneys are not treated here.) This is matrix of scalars and it is used afterwards for formalization of vector flows between particular portfolios. Problem of proper specification of asset Al is again crucial. Here is for the first time required acceptance of Al like means of international payment - it means convertibility and especially usability as reserve currency. Al can be currency of particular state (for example USD) or artificial one (for example pre monetary union EUR). Other countries quote exchange rate of their own currency against AI. After these assumptions Al can also act as <b>settlement</b> <b>currency</b> for clearing between/among countries. Trade can be done through this one or through any other convertible currency. So we distinguish two types of payment procedure. First one is executed directly in Al and second one is calculated in nation currency and then converted into AI. But what really decides is flow of real goods. Surplus or deficit arising from the trade (or better said, trade balance surplus or deficit) will decide about redistribution of Al between considered countries. Chapter 3 highlights some phenomenon that can bring us closer to thinking about exchange rate dynamic and potential risk of turbulence thanks to inappropriate level of fixed exchange rate.
