25|$|Norsk Data engaged {{a number}} of {{consultancy}} companies to analyze the firm in 1989. One important finding was that the customers' perception of ND's strengths and weaknesses was completely different from the employees' perception. Another was that the customers did not understand ND's strategy and a general dissatisfaction with software and the high turnover in the <b>sales</b> <b>force.</b> Also administrative routines {{were found to be}} a shortcoming and one consultant company stated that ND was the company they had investigated which had the most room for improvement. Management introduced a company-wide program to increase all employees' focus on market orientation, but the top management carried out several public blunders in poor customer management through the press. Terje Mikkelsen started negotiations to sell ND to a major competitor, but no deal was ever made.|$|E

Norsk Tipping {{was in the first}} years of the 1970s the first customer to apply an ND system to accounting. The software was developed and owned by ND, but Skår rejected proposals that the company should develop a portfolio of administrative software. At the time this was based on the strategy that the high profit margins were in the central parts of the hardware while independent software firms were not making money. Towards the end of the 1970s this strategy started to backfire, as hardware-oriented customers, such as universities, were pressing down prices while companies which wanted turn-key solutions were increasingly willing to pay full price.|$|E

As components of integrated marketing communication, both <b>sales</b> <b>forces</b> and marketing events should be developed and supported by effective strategies and marketing tactics able to determine the competitive position of the organization. To capitalize on the benefits of <b>sales</b> <b>forces,</b> their position ought to be known in relation to marketing activities within the organization.

In 1927 Marcus was one of three film industry executives who formed a committee to produce a trailer meant to show the industry in a good light. The other members of the committee were Al Lichtman of United Artists and Edmund Grainger of 20th Century Fox. Also in 1927, Marcus continued his championing of the film short. In June he announced a list of well-known writers who would be responsible for penning the shorts for FBO. The list included cartoonists Bill Nolan and Fontaine Fox, and short story writer H. C. Witwer. Marcus began reorganizing the sales management and districts within FBO in September 1927. First he promoted his future partner, Charles Rosenzweig, to head the district overseeing FBO's New York State district, and then completely reorganized the mid-west districts.
