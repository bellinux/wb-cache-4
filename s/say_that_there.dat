25|$|Even {{though many}} {{scientists}} would <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{is a possibility}} that environments hospitable to life exist, there are dissenting views about whether it would make any difference if microbes from Earth are introduced to them.|$|E
50|$|Another {{example is}} 1947. Collins <b>says</b> <b>that</b> Riggs beat Budge in a tour; McCauley <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was no long tour, {{only a short}} one between Riggs and Frank Kovacs. Tom LeCompte <b>says</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a small tour with Riggs {{overcoming}} Budge 12-6 followed by the short Riggs-Kovacs tour (4-3, but 11-10 according to McCauley).|$|R

25|$|As {{described}} above, a {{small minority}} of scientists do disagree with the consensus: see list of scientists opposing global warming consensus. For example, Willie Soon and Richard Lindzen <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is insufficient proof for anthropogenic attribution. Generally this position requires new physical mechanisms to explain the observed warming.|$|E
25|$|Whereas legal {{positivism}} {{would say}} that a law can be unjust without it being any less a law, a natural law jurisprudence would <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is something legally deficient about an unjust norm. Legal interpretivism, famously defended in the English-speaking world by Ronald Dworkin, claims to have a position different from both natural law and positivism.|$|E

25|$|In {{accordance}} with the traditional view of Aristotle, the Hellenistic Greeks generally preferred to distinguish the potential infinity from the actual infinity; for example, instead of {{saying that there are}} an infinity of primes, Euclid prefers instead to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are more prime numbers than contained in any given collection of prime numbers.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear {{power and}} mankind cannot coexist. We {{survivors}} {{of the atomic bomb}} have said this all along. And yet, the use of nuclear power was camouflaged as 'peaceful' and continued to progress. You never know when there's going to be a natural disaster. You can never <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> will never be a nuclear accident.|$|E
25|$|The Athenians {{express their}} shock at the Melians' lack of realism. They <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is {{no shame in}} {{submitting}} to a stronger enemy, especially one who is offering reasonable terms. They also {{argue that it is}} sensible to submit to one's superiors, stand firm against one's equals, and be moderate to one's inferiors.

25|$|Hyperexcitability hypothesizes that {{referred}} pain has no central mechanism. However, it does <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is one central characteristic that predominates. Experiments involving {{noxious stimuli and}} recordings from the dorsal horn of animals revealed that {{referred pain}} sensations began minutes after muscle stimulation. Pain was felt in a receptive field that was some distance away from the original receptive field. According to hyperexcitability, new receptive fields are created {{as a result of}} the opening of latent convergent afferent fibers in the dorsal horn. This signal could then be perceived as referred pain.|$|E
25|$|Former prime {{minister}} Gordon Brown said in April 2014 that Scotland had an above-average {{share of the}} public-sector pension bill and concluded that pensions would be protected by sharing risks and resources within the UK. UK government pensions minister Steve Webb said in May 2014 that Scots would be entitled to the current levels of state pension after independence because they had accumulated rights within the existing system. Webb went on to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{would need to be}} negotiations between the UK and Scotland as to how these pensions would be paid.|$|E
25|$|Despite the ban it is {{not entirely}} true to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were no pubs in the Garden City. Pubs that had existed from before the {{foundation}} of the Garden City continued – including the Three Horseshoes in Norton, The George IV on the borders with Baldock, and the Three Horseshoes and The Fox in Willian – continued to operate (as they do to this day), and undoubtedly benefited from the lack of alcohol to be had in the centre of the town, as did the pubs in neighbouring Hitchin and Baldock. New inns also sprang up on the borders of the town, one such example being the Wilbury Hotel which was just outside the town's border.|$|E

25|$|Supporters of {{the theory}} include sexual {{behavior}} scientists J. Michael Bailey, James Cantor, Alice Dreger, and some openly trans health care providers, Anne Lawrence and Maxine Peterson, and others who <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are {{significant differences between the}} two proposed groups, including sexuality, age of transition, ethnicity, IQ, fetishism, and quality of adjustment. Under the theory, homosexual transsexuals are predicted to begin transitioning earlier in life, generally before turning 30, which accounts for their supposedly better adjustment. They are also more likely to come from poorer, non-white or immigrant backgrounds, have lower IQs, as well as be by definition exclusively attracted to men. Autogynephilic transsexuals are either attracted to women, exclusively or not, or asexual. They are also said under the theory to display more fetishistic or otherwise paraphilic arousal.|$|E
25|$|Forgetting the raw gas {{burns on}} his own arm, Haile Selassie retired into his Palace for a final conference with his chieftains. It was clear {{to him that the}} Government of the Ethiopian Empire would have to move from Addis Ababa. One {{possibility}} was for the government to relocate to Gore in the southwest and he sought comment on this plan. Initially his bearded chiefs said nothing at all. But, when the chiefs did talk, they explained that the one effective Ethiopian army left was fighting for its life under Ras Nasibu Emmanual in the Ogaden. This army was pitted against General Rodolfo Graziani's relentless advance on Harar. They added that the tribes to the west were in an ugly mood. One after another, the chiefs rose to tell how hopeless the situation was and to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was nothing for the Emperor to do but run for his life.|$|E
25|$|Although {{admired by}} his contemporaries, {{he was also}} criticized for using his highly {{efficient}} secret police to spy not only on criminals but also on ordinary citizens. His services opened private letters sent through the mail, which was a frequent practice in Europe at the time, and spied on families. Sartine was thus aware {{of all sorts of}} scandals in the city, notably sexual scandals, and he sent daily reports to the king containing saucy and intimate details about courtiers, clerics, and private citizens, which were said to amuse the king and relieve him from the boredom of court life. Furthermore, his political police was known for its efficiency in detecting agitators, dissenters, anticlerical propagandists, and other people perceived as trouble makers, who were imprisoned without trial through the lettres de cachet. Some sources <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were never more political prisoners at the Bastille and at the fortress of Vincennes than under his tenure.|$|E

25|$|The Central Tibetan Administration {{also says}} that {{millions}} of Chinese immigrants to the TAR are diluting the Tibetans both culturally and through intermarriage. Exile groups say that despite recent attempts to restore the appearance of original Tibetan culture to attract tourism, the traditional Tibetan {{way of life is}} now irrevocably changed. It is also reported that when Hu Yaobang, the general secretary of the Communist Party of China, visited Lhasa in 1980 he was unhappy when he found out the region was behind neighbouring provinces. Reforms were instituted, and since then the central government's policy in Tibet has granted most religious freedoms. But monks and nuns are still sometimes imprisoned, and many Tibetans (mostly monks and nuns) continue to flee Tibet yearly. At the same time, many Tibetans believe projects that the PRC implement to benefit Tibet, such as the China Western Development economic plan or the Qinghai-Tibet Railway, are politically motivated actions to consolidate central control over Tibet by facilitating militarization and Han Chinese migration while benefiting few Tibetans; they also believe the money funneled into cultural restoration projects as being aimed at attracting foreign tourists. They also <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is still preferential treatment awarded to Han Chinese in the labor market as opposed to Tibetans.|$|E
25|$|Harold Gatty {{suggested}} that long-distance Polynesian voyaging followed the seasonal paths of bird migrations. In “The Raft Book,” a survival guide {{he wrote for}} the U.S. military during World War II, Gatty outlined various Polynesian navigation techniques Allied sailors or aviators wrecked at sea could use {{to find their way}} to land. There are some references in their oral traditions to the flight of birds and some <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were range marks onshore pointing to distant islands in line with the West Pacific Flyway. A voyage from Tahiti, the Tuamotus or the Cook Islands to New Zealand might have followed the migration of the long-tailed cuckoo (Eudynamys taitensis) just as the voyage from Tahiti to Hawaii would coincide with the track of the Pacific golden plover (Pluvialis fulva) and the bristle-thighed curlew (Numenius tahitiensis). It is also believed that Polynesians employed shore-sighting birds as did many seafaring peoples. One theory is that they would have taken a frigatebird (Fregata) with them. These birds refuse to land on the water as their feathers will become waterlogged making it impossible to fly. When the voyagers thought they were close to land they may have released the bird, which would either fly towards land or else return to the canoe.|$|E
