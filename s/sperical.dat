We have developed and optimized conditions of the thin layer growth with controllable dimensions of nanorods followed by the ultrasound peeling. The colloid of ZnO nanorods was characterized by measuring the size of particles using the dynamic light scattering (DLS) and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM). We found that the dynamic light scattering (DLS) can’t be directly used for size evaluation of ZnO nanorods due to their non- <b>sperical</b> shape. ...|$|E

The models have similar density profiles in their outer parts (rho propotional to r(exp - 4)) and central power-law density cusps, rho proportional to r(exp 3 -eta), 0 less than eta less than or = 3. The family contains the Jaffe (1983) and Hernquist (1990) models as special cases. We evaluate the surface brightness profile, the line-of-sight velocity dispersion profile, and the distribution function, and discuss analogs of King's core-fitting formula for determining mass-to-light ratio. We also generalize the models to a two-parameter family, in which the galaxy contains a central black hole; the second parameter is {{the mass of the}} black hole. Our models can be used to estimate the detectability of central black holes and the velocity-dispersion profiles of galaxies that contain central cusps, with or without a central black hole...|$|E

Virions of duck spleen necrosis virus, duck infectious anemia virus, chicken syncytial virus, and reticuloendotheliosis virus strain T are <b>sperical</b> with a diameter of approximately 110 nm. They are covered with surface projections about 6 nm long and 10 nm in diameter. The center-to-center distance of surface projections is about 14 nm. The budding virions contain crescent-shaped electron-dense cores 73 nm in diameter with electron-lucent centers. After release of the virions the cores apparently become condensed to 67 nm in diameter. Virions were found budding at the plasma membrane and into smooth-walled, intracytoplasmic vesicles of productively infected cells. The distribution of budding reticuloendotheliosis viruses on cells appeared random over the cell surface, and occasionally aberrant multiple forms of budding virions were observed.

40|$|Blowholes and {{blemishes}} {{were determined}} to start at two stages of manufacturing. <b>Sperical</b> blowholes resulted from trapped gas between the high melting temperature bond glass and the MCP wafer. During thermal processing, the trapped gas expanded and displaced the softened channel glass to form a spherical inclusion. This defect was eliminated by grinding the prefritted bond wafer and channel plate wafer to a flatness which ensured intimate contact prior to fusion. Elliptical blowholes or blemishes were introduced during the fiber draw stage. Contaminants trapped between the core bar and clad tubing volatized providing large quantities of expanding gas. These pockets of gas became elongated to an ellipsoidal shape during fiber draw. Special cleanliness procedures were developed for the grinding, polishing, and acid etching of core bars. Improvements in channel curvature fabrication were implemented. The design of the shearing fixture was evaluated. A new design was developed which eliminated an off-axis moment.

40|$|A new {{development}} in graphite fuel elements for high temperature reactors is {{the application of}} a silicon carbide coating. This coating protects the fuel elements from corrosion during hypothetical water and air exposure in the reactor core.

Inside the graphite matrix of the fuel element the transport can be described with a two- or threedimensional diffusion model. The necessary diffusion parameters are well known and validated by many experiments. The major part of this work deals with the development of a threedimensional diffusion code for cartesian, cylindrical and <b>sperical</b> geometry.

40|$|Mesoscopic density {{functional}} {{theory for}} inhomogeneous mixtures of <b>sperical</b> particles is developed {{in terms of}} mesoscopic volume fractions by a systematic coarse-graining procedure starting form microscopic theory. Approximate expressions for the correlation functions and for the grand potential are obtained for weak ordering on mesoscopic length scales. Stability analysis of the disordered phase is performed in mean-field approximation (MF) and beyond. MF shows existence of either a spinodal or a λ-surface on the volume-fractions - temperature phase diagram. Separation into homogeneous phases or formation of inhomogeneous distribution of particles occurs on the low-temperature side of the former or the latter surface respectively, depending on both the interaction potentials and the size ratios between particles of different species. Beyond MF the spinodal surface is shifted, and the instability at the λ-surface is suppressed by fluctuations. We interpret the λ-surface as a borderline between homogeneous and inhomogeneous (containing clusters or other aggregates) structure of the disordered phase. For two-component systems explicit expressions for the MF spinodal and λ-surfaces are derived. Examples of interaction potentials of simple form are analyzed in some detail, {{in order to identify}} conditions leading to inhomogeneous structures. Comment: 6 figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{effective}} equations {{describing the}} transport of a Brownian passive tracer in a random velocity field are derived, assuming that the lengthscales and timescales on which the transport process takes place are {{much larger than the}} scales of variations in the velocity field. The effective equations are obtained by applying the method of homogenization, that is a multiple-scale perturbative analysis in terms of a small ration epsilon between the characteristic micro- and macro-lengthscales. After expanding the dependent variable and both space and time gradients in terms of epsilon, equating coefficients of like powers of epsilon yields expressions to determine the dependent variable up to any order of approximation. Finally, a Fickian constitutive relation is determine, where the effective transport coefficients are expressed in terms of the ensemble properties of the velocity field. Our results are applied to {{the transport of}} passive tracers in the stationary flow field generated in diluted fixed beds of randomly distributed spheroids, finding the effective diffusivity {{as a function of the}} spheroid eccentricity.

40|$|After some {{historic}} {{remarks and}} a brief summary of recent theoretical news about the QCD phases, {{we turn to the}} issue of freeze−out in heavy ion collisions. We argue that the chemical freeze-out line should actually consists of two crossing lines of different nature. We also consider some inelatic reactions which occure after chemical freeze-out, emphasizing the role of overpopulation of pions. The hydrodynamics (with or without hadronic afterburner) explaines SPS/RHIC data on radial and elliptic flow in unexpected details,for different particles, collision energies, and impact parameters. Apart of Equation of State (EoS), it has basically no free parameters. The EoS which describe these data best agrees quite well with the lattice predictions, with the QGP latent heat ∆ǫ ≈ 800 Mev/fm 3. Other phenomena at RHIC, such as “jet quenching ” and huge ellipticity at large pt, also point toward very rapid entropy production. Its mechanism remains an outstanding open problem: at the end we discuss recent application of the instanton/sphaleron mechanism.

40|$|A {{precision}} {{capillary viscometer}} with a photoelectric timer {{has been designed}} and built for these investigations. On {{the assumption that the}} relative viscosity can be expanded in a power series in concentration, the intrinsic viscosity and the coefficient of the second order term have been measured for suspensions of <b>sperical</b> and rigid rodlike macromolecules. The viscosity of a known heterogenous suspension of rods and spheres has been determined and has been interpreted in terms of interaction coefficients. The Einstein theory of viscosity of dilute suspensions of spheres has been modified to form, together with the approaches of Burgers and Jeffery, a logically consistent theory for the intrinsic viscosity of spherical molecules in particular, and ellipsoid particles in general. The second order theory in volume fraction for the viscosity of suspensions was reviewed. Previous work in this field was found to be in error. It was shown that, when properly interpreted, the linear solution of Burgers to the problem of the viscosity of dilute suspensions of spheres fully explains the variation of the relative viscosity with concentration. The linear theory of Burgers did not adequately explain the variation of the relative viscosity of rod-like molecules with concecntration. This was attributed to mutual orientation effects. The study of the system consisting of rods and spheres also indicated that orientation effects might be important. ...|$|E

The M-&s bond is purely ionic for K, and has only a small covalent contribution for Li. The K and Li atoms are confined within the nearly <b>sperical</b> potential well, and exhibit low-frequency rolling and high-frequency rattling vibrational modes. Oxygen prefers to bind on a C-C bridge site by a strongly covalent epoxy bond which locally modifies the cage and leads to a large anisotropy in the 0 -CW interaction potential. The discovery [1] and mass production [21 of the C 6,, molecule ignited {{a strong interest in}} carbon ful-lerenes and fullerene-derived structures. An impor-tant motivation for chemical modification was the discovery of superconductivity in donor-element in-tercalated C 6,, solids [3 1. The next logical step fol-lowing the formation of such exohedral compounds was to encapsulate atoms in the fullerene cage, lead-ing to molecular endohedral complexes. These sys-tems would provide a unique possibility to tailor spe-cific materials properties, such as dielectric response, optical spectra, and reactivity, on a molecular level [4 - 10 1.

A medium containing tryptone, yeast extract, and glucose or sucrose was used. Horse serum had to be added to obtain substantial growth of B. melaninogenicus. The optimal pH for growth rate and yield was 7. 0 to 7. 2. Lysis of the bacteria occurred when the glucose (or sucrose) was exhausted. The rate of lysis was very high in cultures of S. necrophorus, less so in B. fragilis and B. melaninogenicus. Pleomorphism, manifested as large <b>sperical</b> forms of the bacteria, was observed in the late logarithmic phase of S. necrophorus. Great differences in the length of the lag phase and of the mean generation time were found among the three bacterial species.

40|$|Until recently, {{computations}} {{of space}} plasma flow over a spacecraft have been unstable for ratios of spacecraft dimension to Debye length {{typical of the}} low Earth orbit environment. Calculations are presented of the spacecraft/environment interaction based on two computer codes, MACH and POLAR. MACH, an inside-out particle tracking code, was developed {{for the purpose of}} validating the physics of POLAR in regimes where these are no comprehensive theoretical or experimental results. While the spacecraft which can be treated by MACH are restricted to simple geometries, the methodology is more fundamental than POLAR. MACH generates self-consistent solutions within the context of quasisteady Vlasov plasma flow and achieves Debye ratios previously unobtainable. POLAR uses a three-dimensional finite-element representation of the vehicle in a staggered mesh. The plasma sheath is modeled by outside-in particle tracking. Solutions for the plasma flow, wake and vehicle charging are obtained by Vlasov-Poisson iteration; charge stabilization techniques make the results virtually insensitive to the Debye ratio. POLAR reproduces the Laframboise static plasma solutions for <b>sperical</b> probes and fits the Makita-Kuriki probe data for spheres in a flowing plasma in regions where comparisons are valid. POLAR and MACH solutions for the particle and electrostatic potential structure of the wake of a charged disk in a low-altitude flow are shown for Mach numbers 4, 5, and 8.

The two cytochemical methods show peroxisomes to be nearly <b>sperical</b> particles found only in cells of the proximal convoluted tubule. Lysosomes were identified in the same or parallel sections, with,Q-glycerophosphate or 5 '-cytidylic acid as substrate. They are found in all cells of the nephron. These cytochemical methods visualize the two organelles for light microscopy; they also permit unequivocal differentiation of all kidney peroxisomes from lysosomes in electron micrographs. Peroxisomes are larger and more reactive in {{the cells of the}} pars descendens (P 3 segment) of the proximal convolution, located in the outer medulla and medullary rays, than in the cells of the pars convoluta (P 1 and P 2 segments), situated in the cortex. In contrast, lysosomes are much smaller in the P 3 segment and larger and more reactive in the P 1 and P 2 segments. In all cells of the proximal convolution, peroxisomes tend to be concentrated nearer the base of the cells than do lysosomes. Mitochondria in P 3 cells also show low levels of DAB oxidation at pH 6, in contrast to those in P 1 and P 2 cells.

40|$|A novel {{technique}} {{has been used}} to test the relative low cycle thermal fatigue resistance of different grades of US and Russian beryllium which is proposed as plasma facing armor for fusion reactor first wall, limiter, and divertor components. The 30 KW electron beam test system at Sandia National Laboratories was used to sweep the beam spot along one direction at 1 Hz. This produces a localized temperature ``spike`` of 750 {degrees}C for each pass of the beam. Large thermal stress in excess of the yield strength are generated due to very high spot heat flux, 250 MW/m{sup 2 }. Cyclic plastic strains on the order of 0. 6 % produced visible cracking on the heated surface in less than 3000 cycles. An in-vacuo fiber optic borescope was used to visually inspect the beryllium surfaces for crack initiation. Grades of US beryllium tested included: S- 65 C, S- 65 H, S- 200 F, S- 300 F-H, Sr- 200, I- 400, extruded high purity.

40|$|The {{well-known}} {{versions of}} the sunpath diagrams that appear in the AIA’s Architectural Graphics Standards {{are based on the}} equidistant sky dome projections and use a shading mask protractor developed by Olgyay and Olgyay at Princeton University in the 1950 s. A designer using the AIA’s Graphics Standards book, or other printed {{versions of the}} sunpath diagram, must select the nearest latitude, make photocopies of the appropriate sunpath diagram and shading mask protractor, and then overlay the shading mask protractor upon the diagram in the proper orientation. The outline of the shading device is then transcribed upon the shading mask, aligned at the proper orientation for the facade in which the window is being analyzed, and placed on top of the sunpath diagram to determine if a point centered {{at the base of the}} window is exposed to direct sunlight. Teaching this process to architects and engineers is tedious and error-prone since the students must calculate several angles and then mentally translate their cartesian coordinates onto a <b>sperical</b> coordinate system to determine whether or not their shading device is going to have the intended effect. As a result of this, the sunpath diagram and shading mask protractor are not widely used because many designers either do not understand how to use the tools or do not budget the time to analyze a shading device properly with these tools. This paper describes the new MS-Windows-based educational software package (Oh and Haberl 1996) that has been developed to fast-track the learning of the sunpath diagram and shading mask protractor which is based on previously published equations for plotting the sunpath diagram and shading mask protractor (McWatters and Haberl 1994 a, 1994 b, 1995).

40|$|The main {{topic of}} the thesis is the {{connection}} between representation theory and special functions. We study matrix elements, coupling coefficient, and recoupling coefficients for the simplest Lie and quantum groups. We show {{that a large number}} of multivariable orthogonal and biorthogonal polynomials occurring in the literature may be obtained as coupling coefficients (generalized Clebsch-Gordan coefficients) for multiple tensor products of highest weight representations of the group SU(1, 1). In many cases such polynomials have appeared in applications (physics and statistics), and they are also connected with <b>sperical</b> harmonics. The algebraic interpretation yields a simple and unified approach to the study of these polynomials. The corresponding theory can be developed for the group SU(2) and the oscillator group. Our original motivation came from ``Hankel theory'', more precisely from the higher order Hankel operators introduced by Svante Janson and Jaak Peetre. The Fourier kernels of such operators are Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, and similarly multivariable coupling coefficients are Fourier kernels of certain multilinear forms. We obtain a Schatten class criterion for these higher order Hankel forms. We give two new proofs of the triple sum formula for Wigner 9 j -symbols. These are recoupling coefficients for four-fold tensor products, and appear in the theory of angular momentum in quantum mechanics. We show that general Askey-Wilson and q -Racah polynomials arise as matrix elements for the SU(1, 1) and SU(2) quantum group, respectively. To obtain this interpretation we introduce some new generalized group elements which include the quantum Weyl element as a degenerate case. We also consider coupling coefficients in the quantum group case. These are multivariable generalizations of the q -Racah and Askey-Wilson polynomials; however, we focus on the more elementary case of multivariable q -Hahn polynomials. We prove a binomial formula for two variables satisfying a quadratic relation...|$|E
40|$|We have {{analyzed}} eight high {{angular resolution}} {{images of the}} prototype low mass pre-main-sequence star T Tauri obtained with the Very Large Array between 1987 and 1990. Our objectives were to confirm a recent report that the radio emission is both variable and circularly polarized, to determine whether this behavior originates in the optical star or in the infrared source lying 0. 6 sec to its south, and to identify possible emission mechanisms. No variability or circular polarization was detected in the weak (approximately equals 1 mJy) radio emission associated with the visible star, down to levels of approximately equals 10 %. The observed flux can {{be accounted for by}} free-free emission from an ionized wind with a mass-loss rate M = 3. 7 x 10 (exp - 8) solar mass yr(exp - 1), but a more accurate determination of the spectral index is needed to test the validity of <b>sperical</b> wind models. In sharp contrast, the 3. 6 cm emission of the infrared source is variable (approximately equals 4 - 7 mJy) on time scales {{less than or equal to}} 3 days and circularly polarized at low levels of approximately equals 3 % - 5 %. The polarization was left circular when detected during periods of low radio activity but changed to right circular during a radio outburst, similar to the reversals that have been seen in some RS CVn binary systems. The spectral index is negative during 'quiescence,'and we argue that the emission is nonthermal gyrosynchrotron radiation. The detection of magnetic radio activity in this optically invisible infrared source sparks new interest in clarifying its evolutionary status. Sensitive 3. 6 cm images reveal weak emission extending approximately equals 1 sec west of the T Tau system that is probably associated with high-velocity shock-excited gas flowing toward HH- 1555. We find no radio evidence for a putative third component north of the visible star...|$|E
40|$|For a {{metal fuel}} {{in the form}} of a single particle, the {{existing}} models have been set up to describe its combustion in a steady-state gas-phase flame envelope by building on an analogy with the standard combustion model for a hydrocarbon fuel droplet. These models generally rest on the a-priori constraint that if gravity can be neglected, <b>sperical</b> symmetry will persist for the duration of the combustion process, thus excluding symmetry-breaking to occur. The talk is intended to show that contrary to this assumption, important aspects of combustion are associated with a changeover from the initial spherical symmetry to states of lesser symmetry so that the symmetry constraint of the earlier models needs to be removed. It is proposed that a number of important particle combustion modes exist where transport processes traversing the oxide surface layer exert a controlling influence on the overall reaction process. In this situation the metal surface corresponds to the site of the oxidation reaction which has to be supplied with oxygen from the ambient atmosphere while the intensity of the reaction depends critically on the oxide layer thickness h since oxygen transport across the surface layer in slow. In the standard models ignition is associated with a uniform thinning of the oxide layer, eventually leading to its disappearance. In the talk it isshown that uniform thinning results for much higher temperatures than rupturing and hole formation due to the combined action of capillary forces and the oscillatory Marangoni effect. The Marangoni effect arises from the temperature sensitivity of the surface tension in combination with a temperature gradient which is transverse to the layer interface. Critical conditions for ignition will therefore be associated with layer rupturing so that a spreading rupture is equivalent to a nonuniform transition from a thick layer to a thin one, which amounts to a transition from a regime of low to high reaction intensity, i. e. ignition. The converse effect, namely the critical conditions for drop or bulge formation in an oxide surface layer, determines particle extinction and the onset of cap formation. It is further proposed to investigate the influence of surface curvature on ignition and extinction phenomena, which causes combustion to be different for the case of a planar metal slab in comparison to the case of a spherical particle. It should be pointed out that the trend in applications is towards a decrease in particle sizes, so that there is a great interest in exploring the size effect, which may be expressed in terms of the surface curvature. Beyond criticality in asssociation with ignition and extinction it is further proposed to investigate the actuel spreading of a rupture or a drop in the oxide layer by way of a layer evolution equation...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{explains}} a didactical method for training students {{that has been}} run three times to date. The premise of the course is to combine students from different faculties into interdisciplinary teams. These teams then have a complex problem to resolve within an extremely short time span. In light of recent works from Joy and Kurzweil, the theme Robotics was chosen as an exercise that is timely, interesting and related, but not central to the studies of the various faculties. In groups of 3 to 5, students from faculties of architecture, computer science and mechanical engineering are entrusted to design, build and program a robot which must successfully execute a prescribed set of actions in a competitive atmosphere. The entire course lasts ten days and culminates with the competitive evaluation. The robots must navigate a labyrinth, communicate with on another {{and be able to}} cover longer distances with some speed. In order to simplify the resources available to the students, the Lego Mindstorms Robotic syshed backgrounds instaed of synthetic ones. The combination of digitally produced (scanned) <b>sperical</b> images together with the use of HDR open a wide range of new implementation in the field of architecture, especially in combining synthetic elements in existing buildings, e. g. new interior elements in an existing historical museum). ural presentations in the medium of computer animation. These new forms of expression of design thoughts and ideas go beyond mere model making, and move more towards scenemaking and storytelling. The latter represents new methods of expression within computational environments for architects and designers. its boundaries. The project was conducted using the pedagogical framework of the netzentwurf. de; a relatively well established Internet based communication platform. This means that the studio was organised in the „traditional“ structure consisting of an initial 3 day workshop, a face to face midterm review, and a collective final review, held 3, 5 months later in the Museum of Communication in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. In teams of 3 (with each student from a different university and a tutor located at a fourth) the students worked over the Internet to produce collaborative design solutions. The groups ended up with designs that spanned a range of solutions between real and virtual architecture. Examples of the student’s work (which is all available online) as well as their working methods are described. It must be said that the energy invested in the studio by the organisers of the virtual campus (as well as the students who took part) was considerably higher than in normal design studios and the paper seeks to look critically at the effort in relation to the outcomes achieved. The range and depth of the student’s work was surprising to many in the project, especially considering the initial hurdles (both social and technological) that had to overcome. The self-referential nature of the theme, the method and the working environment encouraged the students to take a more philosg and programming a winning robot. These differences became apparent early in the sessions and each group had to find ways to communicate their ideas and to collectively develop them by building on the strengths of each team member...|$|E
40|$|The life-history of Raillietina cesticillus {{living on}} a chicken has been studied well, for cestodes are {{prevalent}} all over the world. At present, 17 genus, 35 species, of their intermediate hosts are found in Europe and American. In Japan, they belong to common cestodes, but the writer has never found any references dealing with the life-history of them. This paper describs {{the movements of the}} segments and the life-history of the cestodes. They injure their hosts by destroging the tissue of the small intestinal wall, thrusting deep their scolex into its wall, still more entering the muscularis mucosa, and forming intestinal nodules. There are many groups of white Leghorn chickens of 2 years old in the hen-house of Nara Agricultural Laboratory, {{and many of them are}} infected with R. cesticillus. Many gravid segments are found on new feces and many insects gather on the feces to eat the gravid segments. (1) Behavior of gravid segments. Most gravid segments of the excreted R. cesticillus are connected into 4 - 5 segments. They creep about freely on the surface of the new feces. The description of their movements were made by REID, ACKERT and CASE in 1938. When feces are excreted on the ground, the segments move to the edges of moist parts made by the excrements, or to the dark parts of the feces and also to dry sand granule in the circumference of them. In other words, their movements show any tropism against light, heat or gravity. The process of their movements are illustrated in Fig. 1. When their movements stop, the conective segments are separated into a single segment and each segment changes into a milkly white <b>sperical</b> mass. (2) Natual infection of Tachys laetifius. In order to find the intermsdiate hosts of the cestode, the writer collected the following 6 species of the insects; Tetramorium caespitum jacoti WHEELER, Euponera solitaria, Tachys laetificus BATES, Bcmbidion mcrawiti CSIKI, Euborellia pallipes SHIRAKT, Onthophagus atcr WATERHOUSE, from April to September 1951, which were found in the experimental chicken yards mentioned already. By examining whether the above mentioned insects were infected with cysticercoid or not, the writer found that only Tachys laetificus were naturally infected. The dissection of 125 Tachys laetificus, led me to find the fact that 45 beetles (36 %) were infected with cysticercoids. The avarage number of cysticercoids found in one insects were 4. 4 and the maximam number was 19. (3) Forms of onchosphere and cysticercoid. The egg (Fig. 2) of R. cesticillus is about 92 -ll 9 μ long and 72 - 108 μ wide the onchosphero having four membranes is recognized in center of the egg. The onchosphere is about 3 l- 53 μ long and 38 - 46 μ wide and has six embryonal hooks. The middle two hooks (Fig. 2. D.) are about 21 μ and the lateral four hooks (Fig. 2. E.) 17 μ in length. Tachys lactificus, having eaten the onchosphere, begin to grow in the abdominal cavity of the insect and develop into mature cysticercoids. Their developmental process is illustrated in Fig. 3. The mature cysticercoid (Fig. 4) is approximately elliptical and has a larval scolex invaginated in the bladder, which is entirely surrounded by a heavy cyst wall. Neither caudal appendage, a embryonal hook, nor sucher is ackowledged on any of the specimens examined. The size of cysticercoid is 327 - 489 μ long anp 267 - 337 μ wide. (4) Experimental infection of chicken. The writer succeeded in infecting chickens by feeding them cysticercoid taken from Tachys laetificus. That is, the writer examined chicken No. 1 and No. 2 on Aug. 20, 15 th day after the infection; No. 3, No. 1, on Aug. 25, 20 th day after the infection and found parasites of R. cesticillus in the small intestines. The percentage of infection of the cysticercoids in tapeworms was 73. 8 %. As for the controlbirds, kept side by side the experimented birds, they were found negative by the post-mortem examination. Thus the writer could ascertain that Tachys lactificus was the suitable intermediate host for this tapeworm...|$|E
