Davies {{had no knowledge of}} the subject, but soon mastered it. Sir John Franklin came to Davies after many years of service at sea to increase his knowledge of some of the higher branches of the science of navigation. Davies now gave instruction to several gentlemen connected with insurance associations, and was employed to do work for some of the offices. William Morgan, the actuary of the Equitable, furnished him with a certificate of actuarial competency. In 1820 {{he received}} the large silver medal of the Society of Arts for a most ingenious sundial constructed by him. The Directors of the Guardian Assurance Company applied to him for advice and assistance when drawing up their constitution, and he was engaged to construct the necessary tables. About the close of 1823 he was appointed the regular and permanent actuary of that company, an appointment which he held for nearly a third of a century. In the same year (1823) the Reversionary Interest Society was established, and for this company he constructed many elaborate and useful tables. In the first of his reports to the founders of that institution he announced that he had ‘ascertained upon indubitable evidence that a diminution had taken place in the mortality of Great Britain during the last hundred years.’ In 1825 he published ‘Tables of Life Contingencies, containing the rates of mortality among the members of the Equitable Society, and the value of life annuities, reversions, &c. computed therefrom; together with a more extensive <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>premiums</b> for life assurance, deduced from the Northampton rate of mortality, than any hitherto published, and the progressive values of life policies.’ Davies was the remodeller of George Barrett's columnar plan of constructing mortality tables, and so arranged his tables that they may almost be said to be a new discovery (WALFORD, Cyclopædia, i. 618-23). Davies's fame as an actuary became widely known.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{explanation}} of a new methodology in bonus malus system design, capable of taking into account very well known theoretical conditions like fairness and …nancial equilibrium of the portfolio, in addition to market conditions that could …t the resulting <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>premiums</b> into competitive commercial settings. This is done through the resolution of a classical Bayesian decision problem, by means of minimization of the absolute error instead of the classical quadratic error. It is at this stage that we apply Goal Programming methods, which are linear thanks to the equivalence between the minimization of the absolute error and the minimization of the sum of some deviation variables which have a natural interpretation as rating errors. We show in an example how does the new methodology work. All the linear programs have been solved using the simplex method...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we try to}} {{evaluate}} the asymptotic fairness of bonus-malus systems, assuming the simplest case {{when there is no}} hunger for bonus. The asymptotic fairness has to be understood as the bonus-malus system ability in assessing the individual risks in the long run (see Lemaire [1995] p. xvi). Firstly we de…ne the asymptotic fairness of a bonus-malus system following an expression that can be found in Lemaire [1985] p. 168. Secondly, we de…ne a measure of the global asymptotic fairness considering the structure function of the risk group. Finally we try to calculate, for each set of transition rules and a given structure function, the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>premiums</b> that brings the global asymptotic fairness closest to the ideal situation where each insured pays in the long run a premium corresponding to its own claim frequency. This is possible thanks to the application of a multiobjective optimization technique named Goal Programing. We give an example illustrating the fact that the ideal case could be fairly well approached. Keywords: bonus-malus system, asymptotic fairness, Goal Programming, simplex method. Content...|$|E

Data from 22 years of experiments at the Rodale Institute found that, based on the current yields and production costs associated with organic farming in the United States, a price <b>premium</b> <b>of</b> only 10% is required to achieve parity with conventional farming. A separate study found that on a global <b>scale,</b> price <b>premiums</b> <b>of</b> only 5-7% percent were needed to break even with conventional methods.

50|$|According to {{a report}} {{published}} by the CBO in 2008, administrative costs for private insurance represent approximately 12% <b>of</b> <b>premiums.</b> Variations in administrative costs between private plans are largely attributable to economies <b>of</b> <b>scale.</b> Coverage for large employers has the lowest administrative costs. The percentage <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> attributable to administration increases for smaller firms, and is highest for individually purchased coverage. A 2009 study published by BCBSA found that the average administrative expense cost for all commercial health insurance products was represented 9.2% <b>of</b> <b>premiums</b> in 2008. Administrative costs were 11.1% <b>of</b> <b>premiums</b> for small group products and 16.4% in the individual market.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, it {{is shown}} {{that with a}} certain {{definition}} of risk-based discounted loss reserves and a certain method of surplus allocation, there is an amount <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> for a contract which has the following properties: (1.) It is the amount <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> required for the contract to neither help nor hurt the insurer's risk-return relation. (2.) It produces an {{internal rate of return}} equal to the insurer's target return. If the insurer gets more than this amount <b>of</b> <b>premium,</b> then the insurer can get more return with the same risk by increasing the percentage <b>of</b> the <b>premium</b> for the overall book which is in the segment. Conversely, if the insurer gets less than this amount <b>of</b> <b>premium,</b> the insurer can increase its return by decreasing the percentage <b>of</b> the overall <b>premium</b> which is in the segment. The amount <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> is equal to the risk-based premium in "Pricing to Optimize an Insurer's Risk-Return Relation, " (PCAS 1996).

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to present the {{redistribution}} importance <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> and service in the health insurance. In the paper, the particular relationship between the health insurance and the public finance was shown. The redistribution importance <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> and service in the obligatory public health insurance and in the voluntary private health insurance was discussed separately. The structure and importance <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> in the obligatory public health insurance was presented in the connection with the structure and importance of personal income lax. The structure and importance of service in the obligatory public health insurance was shown in the connection with methods of health care rationing (ensured services).
