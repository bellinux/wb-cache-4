5|$|The parasite/host {{relationship}} probably {{drove the}} prevalence of <b>sexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> over the more efficient asexual reproduction. It seems that when a parasite infects a host, <b>sexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> affords {{a better chance of}} developing resistance (through variation in the next generation), giving <b>sexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> variability for fitness not seen in the asexual reproduction, which produces another generation of the organism susceptible to infection by the same parasite. Coevolution between host and parasite may accordingly be responsible for much of the genetic diversity seen in normal populations, including blood-plasma polymorphism, protein polymorphism, and histocompatibility systems.|$|E

5|$|Shortened {{forms of}} this life cycle are common, for example some oceanic scyphozoans omit the polyp stage completely, and cubozoan polyps produce only one medusa. Hydrozoa {{have a variety of}} life cycles. Some have no polyp stages and some (e.g. hydra) have no medusae. In some species, the medusae remain {{attached}} to the polyp and are responsible for sexual reproduction; in extreme cases these reproductive zooids may not look much like medusae. Meanwhile, life cycle reversal, in which polyps are formed directly from medusae without the involvement of <b>sexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> process, was observed in both Hydrozoa (Turritopsis dohrnii and Laodicea undulata) and Scyphozoa (Aurelia sp.1). Anthozoa have no medusa stage at all and the polyps are responsible for <b>sexual</b> <b>reproduction.</b>|$|E

5|$|Some insects use parthenogenesis, {{a process}} in which the female can {{reproduce}} and give birth without having the eggs fertilized by a male. Many aphids undergo a form of parthenogenesis, called cyclical parthenogenesis, in which they alternate between one or many generations of asexual and <b>sexual</b> <b>reproduction.</b> In summer, aphids are generally female and parthenogenetic; in the autumn, males may be produced for <b>sexual</b> <b>reproduction.</b> Other insects produced by parthenogenesis are bees, wasps and ants, in which they spawn males. However, overall, most individuals are female, which are produced by fertilization. The males are haploid and the females are diploid. More rarely, some insects display hermaphroditism, in which a given individual has both male and female reproductive organs.|$|E
5|$|The {{two-fold}} cost of sex {{was first}} described by John Maynard Smith. The first cost {{is that in}} sexually dimorphic species {{only one of the}} two sexes can bear young. (This cost does not apply to hermaphroditic species, like most plants and many invertebrates.) The second cost is that any individual who reproduces sexually can only pass on 50% of its genes to any individual offspring, with even less passed on as each new generation passes. Yet <b>sexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> is the more common means of reproduction among eukaryotes and multicellular organisms. The Red Queen hypothesis has been used to explain the significance of <b>sexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> as a means to enable continual evolution and adaptation in response to coevolution with other species in an ever-changing environment.|$|E

5|$|The apothecium—a {{specialized}} structure {{important in}} <b>sexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> in the ascomycetes—is a cup-shaped fruit {{body that is}} often macroscopic and holds the hymenium, a layer of tissue containing the spore-bearing cells.

5|$|Besides regular <b>sexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> with meiosis, certain fungi, such {{as those}} in the genera Penicillium and Aspergillus, may {{exchange}} genetic material via parasexual processes, initiated by anastomosis between hyphae and plasmogamy of fungal cells. The frequency and relative importance of parasexual events is unclear and may be lower than other sexual processes. It is known {{to play a role in}} intraspecific hybridization and is likely required for hybridization between species, which has been associated with major events in fungal evolution.|$|E

5|$|Stony corals {{have a great}} {{range of}} {{reproductive}} strategies and can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Many species have separate sexes, the whole colony being either male or female, but others are hermaphroditic, with individual polyps having {{both male and female}} gonads. Some species brood their eggs but in most species, <b>sexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> results in the production of a free-swimming planula larva that eventually settles on the seabed to undergo metamorphosis into a polyp. In colonial species, this initial polyp then repeatedly divides asexually, to give rise to the entire colony.|$|E
5|$|Variation {{comes from}} {{mutations}} in the genome, reshuffling of genes through <b>sexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> and migration between populations (gene flow).

5|$|Adiantum viridimontanum largely reproduces asexually by {{branching}} {{rather than}} sexually through spores. While wind-blown spores {{can result in}} <b>sexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> for the species, most spores probably fall within a relatively short radius of the plant. In addition, reproduction through spore dispersal requires the spore to land in suitable conditions for generating a gametophyte, typically in bright sunlight on thin serpentine soils. These requirements allow A.viridimontanum to colonize recently disturbed sites on ultramafic outcrops, where bedrock has been exposed and competing plants have been removed. The populations appear stable, with the long life of individuals compensating for low recruitment rates.|$|E
5|$|Cnidarian <b>sexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> often {{involves}} a complex life cycle with both polyp and medusa stages. For example, in Scyphozoa (jellyfish) and Cubozoa (box jellies) a larva swims until it finds a good site, and then becomes a polyp. This grows normally but then absorbs its tentacles and splits horizontally {{into a series}} of disks that become juvenile medusae, a process called strobilation. The juveniles swim off and slowly grow to maturity, while the polyp re-grows and may continue strobilating periodically. The adults have gonads in the gastroderm, and these release ova and sperm into the water in the breeding season.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{profound}} advances made over recent decades {{in our understanding}} of life's fundamental processes, some basic problems have remained unresolved. One of the major unresolved problems in biology is the primary adaptive function of sex, and particularly its key processes in eukaryotes of meiosis and homologous recombination. One view is that sex evolved primarily as an adaptation that promoted increased genetic diversity (see references e.g.). An alternative view is that sex is an adaptation for promoting accurate DNA repair in germ-line DNA, and that increased genetic diversity is primarily a byproduct that may be useful in the long run. (See also Evolution of <b>sexual</b> <b>reproduction).</b>|$|E

5|$|In biology, a hybrid, or crossbreed, is {{the result}} of {{combining}} the qualities of two organisms of different breeds, varieties, species or genera through <b>sexual</b> <b>reproduction.</b> Hybrids are not always intermediates between their parents (such as in blending inheritance), but can show hybrid vigour, often growing larger or taller than either parent. The concept of a hybrid is interpreted differently in animal and plant breeding, where there is interest in the individual parentage. In genetics, attention is focused on the numbers of chromosomes. In taxonomy, a key question is how closely related the parent species are.|$|E
5|$|Pollination is {{the process}} by which pollen is {{transferred}} in the reproduction of plants, thereby enabling fertilisation and <b>sexual</b> <b>reproduction.</b> Most flowering plants require an animal to do the transportation. While other animals are included as pollinators, the majority of pollination is done by insects. Because insects usually receive benefit for the pollination in the form of energy rich nectar it is a grand example of mutualism. The various flower traits (and combinations thereof) that differentially attract one type of pollinator or another are known as pollination syndromes. These arose through complex plant-animal adaptations. Pollinators find flowers through bright colorations, including ultraviolet, and attractant pheromones. The study of pollination by insects is known as anthecology.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> in Eriophorum angustifolium {{begins with}} {{flowering}} in spring or early summer (in or around May), when groups of 3–5 brown flowers are produced. Fertilisation usually {{takes place in}} May or June, via anemophily (wind-pollination), and the white bristle-like perianth, composed of achenes with pappi (seeds with hairs) then grows outwards to appear like short tufts of cotton thread. These pappi endure well into summer, lasting from around June to September. Like the pappus of Taraxacum (dandelions), this aids in wind-dispersal, and also serves as thermal insulation, conserving {{the temperature of the}} plant's reproductive organs by trapping solar radiation.|$|E

40|$|The colonial ascidian Didemnum moseleyi (Herdman) is {{apparently}} {{the kind of}} organism that should conform to the so-called "Strawberry-Coral model", which predicts that the ratio of <b>sexual</b> to asexual <b>reproduction</b> in organisms like strawberries and corals is greater in crowded than open conditions. It is a thin, white, subtidal colonial ascidian dwelling beneath kelp forests in the shallow coastal waters of New South Wales, Australia. Colonies regularly undergo fission and fusion; the resultant effect is a population of ramets each up to 15 mm diameter. Individuals brood their embryos until a fairly late stage. Rates of <b>sexual</b> and asexual <b>reproduction</b> were examined here for colonies of D. moseleyi that were crowded by a sponge or by conspecific ascidians. Rates of <b>sexual</b> and asexual <b>reproduction</b> were smaller close to sponges, suggesting that exudates from sponges may have had toxic effects on D. moseleyi. Where the natural death of sponges provided free space for D. moseleyi, this was often not colonized, suggesting that, despite appearances, sponges and D. moseleyi were not in immediate competition for space. Rates of fission and production of embryos were also recorded for D. moseleyi ramets at different densities. Again, contrary to expectation, the ratio of <b>sexual</b> to asexual <b>reproduction</b> was larger in colonies at small densities. It was concluded that experimental tests are required to determine causal relationships between crowding and rates of reproduction...|$|R
