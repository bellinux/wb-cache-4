50|$|The Sauer organ whose <b>sound</b> <b>outlet</b> {{is located}} above the altar {{was built in}} 1908 by Wilhelm Sauer (Frankfurt / Oder).|$|E
40|$|The process serves for the {{manufacture}} of ultrasonic radiators and is particularly suited for {{the manufacture}} of ultrasonic group radiators which have a sound probe. The sound probe is provided {{with a large number}} of <b>sound</b> <b>outlet</b> apertures arranged side by side. The <b>sound</b> <b>outlet</b> apertures lead into a sound channel consisting of sound cavities separated from each other by a baffle. The sound probe is divided into a large number of identically shaped disk-like segments. The segments are manufactured individually and then assembled. The segments are designed so that two segments at a time limit the <b>sound</b> <b>outlet</b> aperture, the sound chambers and the baffle. The segments are arranged transversly to a longitudinal axis of the sound probe...|$|E
50|$|Meninga left Canberra and {{returned}} to Queensland in 2005, opening several successful businesses, including a fruit and vegetable wholesale business in the Brisbane Markets, and several Strathfield Car <b>Sound</b> <b>outlets.</b> In late 2005, he was announced as the new Queensland State of Origin coach, to replace Michael Hagan.|$|R
500|$|Madonna {{turned to}} her old friend and {{producer}} John [...] "Jellybean" [...] Benitez to help her remix the songs, and also {{enlisted the help of}} Patrick Leonard, the producer of True Blue. The mixes on You Can Dance exhibited a number of typical mixing techniques. Instrumental passages were lengthened to increase the time for dancing, which undermined the tighter structure of the original pop song. Vocal phrases were repeated and subjected to multiple echoes, panned across the stereophonic <b>sound</b> <b>outlets.</b> At certain points, almost no music is heard except the drums and at other times, the drums are removed with only the hi-hat left to keep time. The album cover denoted Madonna's continuous fascination with Hispanic culture.|$|R
5000|$|The Nisqually River [...] is a {{river in}} west central Washington in the United States, {{approximately}} 81 mi long. It drains {{part of the}} Cascade Range southeast of Tacoma, including the southern slope of Mount Rainier, and empties into {{the southern end of}} Puget <b>Sound.</b> Its <b>outlet</b> was designated in 1971 as the Nisqually Delta National Natural Landmark.|$|R
500|$|After the {{remixing}} of {{the songs}} started, Benitez noted, [...] "We decided on basic questions like 'How loud should the drums be? How much should the vocals stand out?' These are creative decisions which will change the finished piece of music." [...] Shep Pettibone, one of the producers of the album commented that [...] "normally, without some music to work on, the remixer has nothing. But we already had Madonna's catalogue of danceable songs which was enough material for lifetime." [...] The mixes on You Can Dance exhibited a number of typical mixing techniques.

50|$|Westbrook {{encompasses}} three {{islands in}} Long Island Sound, {{all of which}} are uninhabited. Salt Island is the easternmost and smallest, at approximately 0.9 acres. Menunketesuck Island, which is the largest of Westbrook's islands at approximately 4.6 acres, extends into the <b>Sound</b> from the <b>outlet</b> of the Menunketesuck and Patchogue Rivers and is part of the Stewart B. McKinney National Wildlife Refuge. Further west is Duck Island, measuring approximately 3.6 acres.|$|R
40|$|Pre-Holocene {{lacustrine}} sediments {{from a small}} {{coastal lake}} on the Truelove Lowland, northeastern Devon Island, Nunavut Territory, Canada, indicate that a viable terrestrial ecosystem existed prior to postglacial marine inundation and subsequent isostatic emergence of the basin. An AMS 14 C age of 38 ka BP on the basal lacustrine unit provides a preliminary geochronological framework. This "nd has direct implications for regional glacial history, because it argues against both the Late Wisconsinan glaciation of certain coastal lowlands on northern Devon Island, {{as well as the}} occupation of Jones <b>Sound</b> by an <b>outlet</b> of the Innuitian Ice Sheet betwee...|$|R
5000|$|Wampire {{formed in}} 2007, though Phipps and Tinder {{had been playing}} {{together}} since 2001. The duo become {{well known in the}} Portland [...] house show scene for their dance-oriented electronic music. After a shift in musical direction to create a more diversified sound, the band began recording their debut album Curiosity in late 2012. The album was produced by Jake Portrait from fellow Portland band Unknown Mortal Orchestra and released by Polyvinyl Records on May 13, 2013. The album was well received by critics, with positive reviews from Paste, Pitchfork, Allmusic, Consequence of <b>Sound,</b> and other <b>outlets.</b>|$|R
40|$|There {{is a large}} {{quantity}} of natural steam discharged from fumaroles or drill-holes in geothermal areas. The flow of steam in underground layers {{is characterized by the}} condition of conservation of enthalpy, so far as it is assumed thermally insulated to the surrounding medium. Therefore, as to the steam originating from deep thermal water, a state of superheat can be observed at each pressure level as it rises to ground surface. The highest possible limit of its temperature is 163 Â°C at 1 atm. Velocity of fluid ejected from a pipe is known to be unable to exceed the local velocity of <b>sound</b> at the <b>outlet.</b> This limitation is adapted to the flow in a well ejecting steam or boiling water. The sound velocity in the two-phase system of saturated steam and water are calculated at various pressures and mixing ratios. The result shows nearly linear relation of pressure and discharge rate for the flow, the velocity of which is equal to that of sound. The fluid pressure at the orifice is considered to be nearly always equal to the external atmospheric pressure for the well from which the ejecting velocity is below the sound velocity under atmospheric pressure but it becomes higher and is governed by the discharge rate through the well which has higher velocity of ejection than the above. Discharge rates from such boiling wells are then restricted. The well ejecting superheated steam must has a different limit of discharge to preserve its superheated temperature. This limit is obtained by the continuity of energy flux and is shown to be lower than that given by the sound velocity for most of superheated range. Such states are compared with observations...|$|R
