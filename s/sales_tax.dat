5|$|After {{six days}} of state {{government}} shutdown, Corzine and Assembly Democrats agreed to raise the state <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> to 7% {{with half of the}} 1% increase going to the state budget and the other half going to property tax relief. On July 8, 2006, the $30billion state budget, with the <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> agreement, passed both houses and Governor Corzine signed the budget into law ending the budget impasse.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Combs had {{advocated}} a progressive platform that included increased funding for education, highways, parks, industry, and airports. Soon after his election, he won {{approval for a}} three-percent <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> to pay a bonus to military veterans, although he could have funded the bonuses with a one-percent tax. He had asked for the larger tax in order to fund his other priorities. As {{a result of the}} <b>sales</b> <b>tax,</b> Combs presided over the state's first billion-dollar budget. One study showed that Kentucky doubled its per capita expenditures between 1957 and 1962, growing its appropriations faster than any other state. Combs held large public relations events for each tax-funded project that was completed, declaring in dedication speeches that the <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> had made the project possible.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, a North Shore Towers {{resident}} {{noticed a}} zip code error when making an online purchase. After further investigation in 2001, {{it was determined}} that the North Shore Towers was one of four zip codes that were mistakenly charged a Nassau County <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> of 8.5% instead of the New York City <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> of 8.25% because the zip codes cross the city line. Residents argued that New York City should receive their tax dollars and not Nassau County. This error was corrected by late 2001.|$|E

50|$|Most {{states and}} localities {{imposing}} <b>sales</b> and use <b>taxes</b> in the United States exempt resellers from <b>sales</b> <b>taxes</b> on goods held for sale and ultimately sold.

5|$|The {{increase}} {{in the rate of}} the state <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> from 6% to 7% took effect on July 15, 2006, and also increased the <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> rate in the state's Urban Enterprise Zones (UEZs) from 3% to 3.5%. A significant change was made in the payment of sales taxes by businesses operating in the UEZs in that they would be required to pay the entire amount of the full tax rate to the state on all appropriate purchases, and wait for the state to rebate them the difference.|$|E
5|$|The <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> rate, {{as defined}} in the {{legislation}} for the first year, is 23% of the total payment including the tax ($23 of every $100 spent in total—calculated similar to income taxes). This would be equivalent to a 30% traditional U.S. <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> ($23 on top of every $77 spent—$100 total, or $30 on top of every $100 spent—$130 total). After {{the first year of}} implementation, this rate is automatically adjusted annually using a predefined formula reflecting actual federal receipts in the previous fiscal year.|$|E
5|$|As of 2005, South Dakota has {{the lowest}} per capita total state tax rate in the United States. The state does not levy {{personal}} or corporate income taxes, inheritance taxes, or taxes on intangible personal property. The state <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> rate is 4.5 percent. Various localities have local levies so in some areas the rate is 6 percent. The state <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> {{does not apply to}} sales to Indians on Indian reservations, but many reservations have a compact with the state. Businesses on the reservation collect the tax and the state refunds to the Indian Tribes the percentage of <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> collections relating to the ratio of Indian population to total population in the county or area affected. Ad valorem property taxes are local taxes and are a large source of funding for school systems, counties, municipalities and other local government units. The South Dakota Special Tax Division regulates some taxes including cigarette and alcohol-related taxes.|$|E
50|$|Taxation in Missouri {{primarily}} {{takes the}} form of income <b>taxes,</b> <b>sales</b> <b>taxes,</b> and property taxes. The Missouri Department of Revenue administers and collects the income and <b>sales</b> <b>taxes,</b> including local <b>sales</b> <b>taxes,</b> whereas property taxes are entirely administered by local jurisdictions. In addition to the aforementioned taxes, excise taxes are imposed on cigarettes and tobacco products, motor vehicle leases, and locally administered income taxes within the cities of Kansas City and St. Louis.|$|R

5|$|Corzine, in {{attempting}} to pass his conceptual budget, came into conflict with fellow state Democrats in the New Jersey General Assembly, particularly over their refusal to implement his proposed increase of the state's <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> from 6% to 7% to fill a $4.5 billion budget gap. Corzine maintained that the gap could not be filled by any other means due to the state's constitution and a ruling of New Jersey's Supreme Court. Long before the deadline date, Corzine had stated {{that he would not}} accept a budget that did not include a <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> increase. Due to Corzine's insistence, the state's General Assembly, which was dominated by Democrats, refused to pass a budget before the deadline.|$|E
5|$|In {{her first}} {{address to the}} legislature, Collins asked for an {{additional}} $324million from the Kentucky General Assembly, most of it allocated for education. The additional revenue was {{to be derived from}} Collins' proposed tax package, which included increasing the income tax on individuals making more than $15,000 annually, extending the <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> to cover services such as auto repair and dry cleaning, and increasing the corporate licensing tax. After opposition to her proposal developed among legislators during the 1984 biennial legislative session, Collins revised the tax package. She retained the corporate licensing tax increase, but replaced the <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> and income tax modifications with a flat five percent personal income tax and phasing out the deductions for depreciation which corporations could claim on their state taxes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sales</b> <b>taxes</b> are {{generally}} charged on each purchase, with no low income exemption.

Therefore, <b>sales</b> <b>taxes</b> {{are generally}} regressive, and have a negative Suits index.|$|R
5|$|Minnesota has a {{progressive}} income tax structure; the four brackets of {{state income tax}} rates are 5.35, 7.05, 7.85 and 9.85 percent. As of 2008, Minnesota was ranked 12th {{in the nation in}} per capita total state and local taxes. In 2008, Minnesotans paid 10.2 percent of their income in state and local taxes; the U.S. average was 9.7 percent. The state <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> in Minnesota is 6.875 percent, but there is no <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> on clothing, prescription drug medications, some services, or food items for home consumption. The state legislature may allow municipalities to institute local sales taxes and special local taxes, such as the 0.5 percent supplemental <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> in Minneapolis. Excise taxes are levied on alcohol, tobacco, and motor fuel. The state imposes a use tax on items purchased elsewhere but used within Minnesota. Owners of real property in Minnesota pay property tax to their county, municipality, school district, and special taxing districts.|$|E

50|$|The {{trend has}} been for {{conventional}} <b>sales</b> <b>taxes</b> {{to be replaced by}} more broadly based value-added taxes.

5|$|Meeting on {{the third}} day of the special session, Democratic factions within the General Assembly reached a {{compromise}} budget. That tentative budget proposed an increase in the state <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> from 6% to 7%, which was estimated to generate an additional $1.1 billion in revenue. The plan also included a requirement to use half of that for direct relief toward New Jersey's property tax—highest of all states. The plan also called for the same dedicated purpose for all of the money raised by this <b>sales</b> <b>tax</b> increase in subsequent years. The new budget law included a provision for a constitutional amendment which was required, like all such amendments in the state, to be approved in an Election Day referendum. On November 7, 2006, New Jersey voters approved this measure by a two to one margin statewide.|$|E
5|$|One {{avenue for}} {{non-compliance}} {{is the black}} market. FairTax supporters state that the black market is largely untaxed under the current tax system. Economists estimate the underground economy in the United States to be between one and three trillion dollars annually. By imposing a <b>sales</b> <b>tax,</b> supporters argue that black market activity would be taxed when proceeds from such activity are spent on legal consumption. For example, the sale of illegal narcotics would remain untaxed (instead of being guilty of income tax evasion, drug dealers would be guilty of failing to submit <b>sales</b> <b>tax),</b> but they would face taxation when they used drug proceeds to buy consumer goods such as food, clothing, and cars. By taxing this previously untaxed money, FairTax supporters argue that non-filers would be paying part of their share of what would otherwise be uncollected income and payroll taxes.|$|E
