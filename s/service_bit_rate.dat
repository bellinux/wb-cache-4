40|$|This paper investigates how Scalable Video Coding (SVC) {{can benefit}} from {{different}} Forward Error Correction (FEC) and transmission schemes in mobile broadcast systems. Simulation are performed in DVB-H (Digital Video Broadcasting - Handheld) systems. In DVB-H, a differentiation in robustness for the different SVC layers can be achieved at the link layer using intra-burst MPE-FEC (multi-Protocol Encapsulation FEC). The paper evaluates the gain {{that can be achieved}} with the MPE-FEC using equal (EEP) and unequal error protection (UEP), and the performance improvements of an SVC layer-aware FEC (LA-FEC) approach that can be implemented in DVB-H either at the link layer with MPE-iFEC (inter-burst MPE-FEC) or at the application layer with AL-FEC. LA-FEC improves the SVC base layer robustness generating parity information across existing dependencies within the SVC video coding structure. Laboratory measurement results using a TU 6 channel model show that the performance of an SVC service in DVB-H can be significantly increased by a proper link layer FEC scheme. It is shown that using SVC in combination with LA-FEC and a proper transmission scheduling does not only give a better performance in terms of PSNR and amount of video outages compared to a single layer service at the same <b>service</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rate,</b> but also gives an additional lower quality layer which can be used for applications like conditional access...|$|E

Voice, data, video teleconferencing, and television with broad range of <b>service</b> (<b>bit)</b> <b>rates</b> are multiplexed through a broadband satellite, channel in a multiple-access fashion. Large (but finite) population sizes are considered with arrivals modeled by binomial distributions. A two-state minisource model is used for voice signals. For video, variable rate interframe coding is utilized to reduce the bandwidth requirements, and Markov phase processes model the modulation of the rates of the video teleconferencing and television signals. Among these services, video and voice are real-time signals and can not tolerate large random delays. In our attempt to satisfy this, video and voice use the Synchronous Transfer Mode (STM) with a frame structure, while the data users (with their bursty traffic) send (and retransmit, if necessary) their packets randomly within a frame. The video and voice users make their schedules in advance by using a pre- assigned slot (status slot). The first portion of a frame is assigned to the variable rate video users, while the variable rate voice users fill up the last portion of the frame. Data packets fill up the remaining slots between these two movable boundaries in a random-access fashion. In this protocol, the delay introduced by the satellite is taken into consideration.
