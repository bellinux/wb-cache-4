50|$|Between {{chemical}} and mechanical pulps there are semi-chemical pulps that use a mild chemical treatment followed by refining. <b>Semi-chemical</b> <b>pulp</b> {{is often used}} for corrugating medium. Bales of recycled paper (normally old corrugated containers) for unbleached (brown) packaging grades may be simply pulped, screened and cleaned. Recycling to make white papers is usually done in a deinking plant, which employs screening, cleaning, washing, bleaching and flotation. Deinked pulp is used in printing and writing papers and in tissue, napkins and paper towels. It is often blended with virgin pulp.|$|E
50|$|Fodder: Not {{widely used}} as fodder, but in India 1-year-old {{plantations}} are browsed by cattle. Apiculture: The flowers {{are a source}} of pollen for honey production. Fuel: A major source of firewood, its dense wood and high energy (calorific value of 4500-4900 kcal/kg) contribute to its popularity. It provides very good charcoal that glows well with little smoke and does not spark. Fibre: The wood is extensively used for paper pulp. Plantation-grown trees have been found promising for the production of unbleached kraft pulp and high-quality, neutral, sulphite <b>semi-chemical</b> <b>pulp.</b> Large-scale plantations have already been established, as in Kerala, India, for the production of pulp. Timber: The sapwood is yellow; the heartwood light brown to dark red, straight grained and reasonably durable. The wood has a high basic density (500-650 kg/m³), is fine-grained, often attractively figured and finishes well. It is excellent for turnery articles, toys, carom coins, chessmen and handicrafts. Also used for furniture, joinery, tool handles, and for construction if trees of suitable girth are available. Tannin or dyestuff: The bark contains sufficient tannin (13-25%) for commercial exploitation and contains 6-14% of a natural dye suitable for the soga-batik industry. In India, the bark is collected locally for use as tanning material. A natural dye, used in the batik textile industry in Indonesia, is also extracted from the bark. Other products: An edible mushroom, Tylopylus fellus, is common in plantations of A. auriculiformis in Thailand.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} pH on fiber and paper properties, during beating and sheet formation, was {{investigated}} for three different pulps. The pulps were pH adjusted to four different pH levels between 3 and 9. Isotropic laboratory sheet {{were made of}} both unbeaten and beaten pulps. The beaten neutral sulfite <b>semi-chemical</b> <b>pulp</b> and bleached softwood kraft pulp were affected by changes in pH; bleached softwood kraft pulp in a minor extent due to less fiber surface charges. Compared to the other pH levels, pH 3 showed a lower fiber surface charge, water retention value, tensile index, tensile stiffness index, compressive index and edge crush resistance index. SEM pictures showed a denser network at pH 9 than for pH 3. This was seen for both neutral sulphite semi-chemical and softwood kraft pulp. The unbeaten pulps and beaten bleached hardwood kraft pulp were not affected by changes in pH. SEM pictures showed {{no difference in the}} fiber network for bleached hardwood kraft pulp. A mill trial, with neutral sulphite <b>semi-chemical</b> <b>pulp,</b> at pH levels between pH 4. 8 and pH 5. 6 was completed. No significant difference was seen for any mechanical property...|$|E
40|$|<b>Semi-chemical</b> <b>pulps</b> from poplar wood of {{different}} clones, sites and ages were prepared {{according to the}} NSSC-method. The results reveal: Poplar <b>semi-chemical</b> <b>pulps</b> show higher strength properties than industrial as well as laboratory made NSSC-pulps from beech wood. However, the pulping conditions have to be optimized for every clone. Under used <b>pulping</b> conditions <b>semi-chemical</b> <b>pulps</b> from the clone "Scott Pauley" were of lower strength properties compared {{to those of other}} clones. The results show clearly that for the build-up of the strength properties the site is by far more important than the age of the trees used for <b>pulping.</b> <b>Semi-chemical</b> <b>pulps</b> obtained from different height levels show wide differences in their mechanical properties. Bark content up to 15 % has no significant influence on the mechanical properties of NSSC-pulps from poplar wood but on their yield...|$|R

50|$|The Kappa {{number is}} {{determined}} by ISO 302:2004. ISO 302 is applicable {{to all kinds of}} chemical and <b>semi-chemical</b> <b>pulps</b> and gives a Kappa number in the range of 1-100. The Kappa number is a measurement of standard potassium permanganate solution that the pulp will consume. The measurement is inflated by the presence of hexenuronic acids in the pulp. These compounds are formed during the chemical pulping process, from the hemicelluloses.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 Douglas-fir {{wood chips}} from Oregon were pulped with kraft green liquor to produce <b>semi-chemical</b> <b>pulps</b> with {{properties}} {{suitable for the}} manufacture of corrugating medium. The effects of five cooking variables were studied, chemical charge, chip size, bark content of chips, pulping temperature, and liquor sulfidity. The combinations of levels of these five independent variables were chosen according to an incomplete block design, which allowed a maximum amount of statistical information to be obtained from only 30 individual cooks. Pulping properties studied were pulp yield, total solids of the waste liquor, pH of the waste liquor, the hypo number test of the pulp, and such pulp strength properties as Concora crush strength, tensile, burst, tear, and stiffness. Chemical charge {{is the most important}} single variable affecting pulp yield, tensile strength, and Concora strength, whereas the sulfidity does not affect the pulp yield but does affect the tensile and Concora strengths. Cooking temperature, bark content, and chip size have less significant effects on pulp yields and pulp strength properties. Green liquor pulps have distinctly darker colors than neutral sulfite pulps from the same wood species, and the former pulp forms denser sheets than the latter. Generally speaking, green liquor <b>semi-chemical</b> Douglas-fir <b>pulps</b> are equivalent to or slightly lower in quality than other commercial <b>semi-chemical</b> <b>pulps</b> in Concora strength, but equal or slightly superior to them in tensile and bursting strengths. The deficiency in Concora strength can be overcome with increased refining, and the slightly higher pulp yield and elimination of the causticizing step make the green liquor semi-chemical process more attractive for corrugating medium...|$|R
40|$|Pulp {{and paper}} {{production}} has three major processing steps: pulping, bleaching, and paper production. The type of pulping {{and the amount}} of bleaching used depend {{on the nature of the}} feedstock and the desired qualities of the end product. Neutral sulphite <b>semi-chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> (NSSC) is one of the chemical pulping processes that can be used. It involves partial delignification of hardwood feedstock using a buffered sodium sulphite solution, with completion of the pulping process by mechanical means. NSSC pulps are used in corrugating media and in certain writing and printing papers. Not all neutral-sulphite pulping and related processes that could result in the emission of significant amounts of NMVOC, SOx, particulates, NOx and CO are included under SNAP code 040603. Other significant sources are listed in Table 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The safe {{disposal}} of black liquor generating from Neutral Sulfi de <b>Semi-Chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> {{section of the}} paper mills {{is one of the}} challenging issue in the developing countries. A treatment feasibility study was conducted on a laboratory scale UASB (Upfl ow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket) reactor running on continuous fl ow basis for about 30 weeks at neutral pH and at constant temperature of 33 °C. It is observed that about 35 % of black-liquor COD could be reduced at a hydraulic retention time of 38 hours and at an organic loading rate of 2. 75 kg-COD/m 3 -day. The average gas production and methane gas conversion at optimum conditions was observed to be 0. 17 m 3 /kg-CODrem-day and 0. 88 L-CH 4 /g-CODrem-day, respectively. The overall methane composition was noticed to be 61 % of the biogas. This study suggests that the post-treatment of NSSC pulping effl uent is required to meet the safe effl uent disposal standards...|$|R
40|$|Twin-screw {{extrusion}} pulping is a {{new approach}} to the manufacture of pulp for paper production, designed for non-wood feedstocks. In this research, the production of pulp from rice stem with a newly fabricated twin-screw extruder was investigated. Extrusion pulping of rice stem was conducted following a central composite design using a two-level factorial plan involving three process variables (pretreatment NaOH concentration: 0. 4, 0. 8, 1. 2 %; extrusion temperature: 40, 60, 80 oC; and extruder rotational speed: 55, 70, 85 rpm). Responses of pulp and handsheets properties to the process variables were analyzed using statistical software (MINITAB 15). As the results show, pulping of rice stem fiber can be done at a relatively short pretreatment time about 4 hours and a low NaOH concentration about 0. 8 % by twin-screw extruder with limit extrusion temperature of about 80 oC and extruder rotational speed about 85 rpm. The effect of pretreatment solvent, NaOH, is greatly enhanced by increases in the extrusion temperature. Analysis of the results revealed that this process has suitable potential to be used to obtain a pulp with yields approximately equivalent to neutral sulfite <b>semi-chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> at fixed kappa number, which is applicable for fluting paper and linerboard production...|$|R
40|$|Cellulose fibers {{undergo a}} series of {{irreversible}} changes i. e hornification when exposed to cycles of wetting and drying. In this study, the effect of recycling on {{physical and chemical properties}} of chemimechanical pulp (CMP) and neutral sulfite <b>semi-chemical</b> (NSSC) <b>pulp</b> was evaluated. The pulps were recycled three times. Hornification was measured by Water retention value. The results indicated that water retention value and carboxyl groups were decreased due to recycling, hornification also increased during cycles of wetting and drying. Changes in crystalline structure of the pulp during first cycle of recycling were investigated by ATR- FTIR. The crystallinity index increased to some extent, when compared to virgin pulp. Recycling influence on the fiber length was not significant. Hornification introduced as a main cause of poor properties of recycled paper. Also, reduction of carboxyl groups {{could be one of the}} causes for lowering water retention value and decrease in strengths...|$|R
40|$|The methane {{potential}} and biodegradability of different ratios of acetate and lignin-rich effluents from a neutral sulfite <b>semi-chemical</b> (NSSC) <b>pulp</b> mill were investigated. Results showed ultimate methane yields up to 333 ± 5 mL CH 4 /gCOD when only acetate-rich substrate was added and subsequently lower methane potentials of 192 ± 4 mL CH 4 /gCOD when the lignin fraction was increased. The presence of lignin showed a linear decay in methane production, {{resulting in a}} 41 % decrease in methane when the lignin-rich feed had a 30 % increase. A negative linear correlation between lignin content and biodegradability was also observed. Furthermore, the effect of hydrotalcite (HT) addition was evaluated and showed increase in methane potential of up to 8 %, a faster production rate and higher soluble lignin removal (7 – 12 % higher). Chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiencies between 64 and 83 % were obtained for all samples. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R
40|$|Empty oil-palm bunches (EOPB), {{due to high}} {{contents}} of lignin (24. 68 percent) and extractives (5. 57 percent), is less economical when it is pulped using the conventional semi-chemical or semi- mechanical process into newsprint pulp. The conventional process is unable to partly dissolve the lignin and ex/ractives effectively, and consequently produces EOPB pulp with undesirable results, i. e. low screened yield, poor qualities, and longer defiberation and fibrillation duration. As one way to cope with it, the EOPB prior to the soda anthraquinone (AQ) <b>semi-chemical</b> <b>pulping</b> should be pretreated by biodelignification. In this regard, the EOPB chips were biodelignified through the inoculation of the raw materials with the Cipanas-strainfungi (CPSOI) as much as 5 -and 10 -percent (oven dry weight), and further incubated for I 0 -and 20 -days. Afterwards, the fungi-treatedchips were semi-chemically pulped using the soda-AQ process into newsprint pulp after they are cooked in an electrically heated digester. After the cooking, the EOPB chips were defiberized in a Hollander beater, stone-refined, and then fibrillated in a Niagara beater into ultimately the EOPB pulp with the degree offreeness at 300 CSF. The handsheet was further prepared from the EOPB pulp with the basis weight 45 - 50 gram per m 3. This experiment was mainly aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of biodelignification using Cipanas-strain fungi on the chemical components, processing properties, and qualities of the resulting EOPB pulp for newsprint. The chemical analysis revealed that the inoculation of the EOPB chips with 10 -percent of CPSO I isolat followed by 20 -day incubation period brought about the decreases in lignin and extractive contents by 6. 32 -and- 2. 61 -percent, respectively. Besides such biodelignification also induces the increase in pulp yield (by maximally 3. 98 percent), and the decreases in kappa number and energy consumption (by 11. 19 and 17. 56 percent, respectively). Further, the EOPB 2 ̆ 7 s pulp handsheet for newsprint achieved particular values of tensile index (43. 67 Nm/gr), tear index (7. 96 Nm 2 /kg), opacity (93. 98 percent) and brightness (58. 04 °GE) which corresponded to those of Indonesian National Standard (SNI) No. 14 - 0691 - 1998 for newsprint...|$|R
40|$|With {{the final}} aim of {{reducing}} the energy consumption and increase the methane production at Swedish pulp and paper mills, the methane potential of 62 wastewater effluents from 10 processes at seven pulp and/or paper mills (A-G) was determined in anaerobic batch digestion assays. This mapping {{is a first step}} towards an energy efficient and more sustainable utilization of the effluents by anaerobic digestion, and will be followed up by tests in lab-scale and pilot-scale reactors. Five of the mills produce kraft pulp (KP), one thermo-mechanical pulp (TMP), two chemical thermo-mechanical pulp (CTMP) and two neutral sulfite <b>semi-chemical</b> (NSSC) <b>pulp.</b> Both elementary and total chlorine free (ECF and TCF, respectively) bleaching processes were included. The effluents included material from wood rooms, cooking and oxygen delignification, bleaching (often both acid- and alkali effluents), drying and paper/board machinery as well as total effluents before and after sedimentation. The results from the screening showed a large variation in methane yields (percent of theoretical methane potential assuming 940 NmL CH 4 per g TOC) among the effluents. For the KP-mills, methane yields above 50 % were obtained for the cooking effluents from mills D and F, paper machine wastewater from mill D, condensate streams from mills B, E and F and the composite pre-sedimentation effluent from mill D. The acidic ECF-effluents were shown to be the most toxic to the AD-flora and also seemed to {{have a negative effect on}} the yields of composite effluents downstream while three of the alkaline ECF-bleaching effluents gave positive methane yields. ECF bleaching streams gave higher methane yields when hardwood was processed. All TCF-bleaching effluents at the KP mills gave similar degradation patterns with final yields of 10 - 15 % of the theoretical methane potential for four of the five effluents. The composite effluents from the two NSSC-processes gave methane yields of 60 % of the theoretical potential. The TMP mill (A) gave the best average yield with all six effluents ranging 40 - 65 % of the theoretical potential. The three samples from the CTMP process at mill B showed potentials around 40 % while three of the six effluents at mill G (CTMP) yielded 45 - 50 %...|$|R
