50|$|Galinsoga quadriradiata is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the daisy family which is known by several common names, including <b>shaggy</b> <b>soldier,</b> Peruvian daisy, hairy galinsoga, and fringed quickweed. Its native home is apparently central Mexico, although it has become naturalized in many other places (North and South America, Europe, Japan, Philippines, the northern India, Nepal, etc.). Hairy galinsoga is considered a weed throughout its native and introduced range.|$|E
40|$|The <b>shaggy</b> <b>soldier</b> [Galinsoga ciliata (Rafin) S. F. Blake], family Asteraceae] is an {{invasive}} species that poses a growing threat to crop production. This annual plant produces heteromorphic achenes in a capitulum type inflorescence. The {{objective of this}} study was to compare selected morphological and phenological parameters and the success of generative reproduction in plants developed from peripheral and central achenes of the capitulum. The somatic variability of G. ciliata diaspores contributed to differences in the growth rates, development and fertility of the resulting populations. The progeny of central diaspores developed at a slower rate than the individuals derived from peripheral achenes, but at the end of their life cycle, the offspring of dimorphic achenes formed homogenous groups as regards height values. On average, the initial phenophases of G. ciliata plants derived from central achenes began one day later, and they entered the flowering stage eight days later than the individuals developed from peripheral seeds. At the initial growth stage (experimental day 65 to 83), the progeny of central achenes produced fewer capitula. On day 133, the individual fertility of the plants derived from central diaspores was 10 % higher on average in comparison with the offspring of peripheral achenes...|$|E
