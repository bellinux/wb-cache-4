5000|$|Kricfalusi {{said that}} he {{restored}} the [...] "old time-director-unit system" [...] in which three or four directors theoretically supervise all of the creative aspects of each individual cartoon. He said {{that two of the}} directors felt [...] "kind of" [...] reluctant to participate as they did not [...] "really approve" [...] of the direction. Kricfalusi intended for the cartoon to be [...] "like a Warner Bros. cartoon", and that the show does not have his personal humor style. He described the team as [...] "slightly cautious" [...] in presenting ideas to CBS's executives. Artists were allowed to use their own style in the episodes that they worked on, and that one can determine which artist drew which cartoon based on the styles present. Kricfalusi described Ken Boyer's <b>scenes</b> <b>as</b> [...] "cute and dynamic," [...] Istvan's <b>scenes</b> <b>as</b> [...] "extremely crazy-looking," [...] his own <b>scenes</b> <b>as</b> [...] "very specifically acted," [...] Lynne's <b>scenes</b> <b>as</b> [...] "very girly and cartoony at the same time," [...] and Jim Smith's <b>scenes</b> <b>as</b> [...] "manly and well composed." ...|$|R

The pursuit of realism included the staff conducting firearms research at a facility in Guam. Nishikubo has highlighted the tank <b>scene</b> <b>as</b> an example of the movie's realism, noting that bullets create sparks when hitting metal, but do not spark when a bullet strikes stone.|$|E

5|$|George Meyer {{obtained}} {{inspiration for}} the scene toward {{the beginning of the}} episode where Rainier Wolfcastle is taunting the children from an experience he had with Arnold Schwarzenegger. He was following Schwarzenegger during a hike, and overheard him taunting his children.

5|$|In his History of Animals, Aristotle {{considered}} that the garden warbler eventually metamorphosed into a blackcap. The composer Olivier Messiaen used {{the song of}} the garden warbler as the basis for his 1971 solo piano piece La fauvette des jardins, the title being the French name of the species. His Turangalîla-Symphonie, a major work inspired by the legend of Tristan and Iseult, has a summer garden <b>scene</b> <b>as</b> its sixth movement.

5|$|Marochetti {{accepted}} {{the commission and}} created plaster models of the reliefs. He installed one of the models in his château in France, where it remains today, while the other was set into {{the wall of a}} gardener's cottage adjoining his French estate. The bronze relief of the deathbed scene was added to the pedestal in August 1866, while the Taking of Ascalon was installed in March 1867. The Art Journal criticised the deathbed <b>scene</b> <b>as</b> being excessively stretched lengthways and noted similarities with a painting displayed in the Houses of Parliament, created by John Cross, that depicted the same subject.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the group's debut, some of {{the members}} were already {{involved}} in the entertainment industry.

5|$|The {{second to}} fifth {{scenes of the}} Hachisuka scroll are set in the evening of Kankō 5, 9th month, 15th day (October 16, 1008). On that day, the prime {{minister}} and baby's grandfather, Fujiwara no Michinaga, celebrates the birth. In the second text scene of the emaki, Murasaki Shikibu describes how everybody including servants, minor officials and high nobility was joyful and happy. Tables with rice balls (mochi) were placed in the garden, the full moon shone beautifully and torches made the <b>scene</b> <b>as</b> bright as in daylight. There is one illustration following this scene.|$|E
5|$|The sixteenth {{episode of}} Gundam SEED {{features}} {{a scene in}} which Kira Yamato is seen dressing after getting out of a bed where the teenage girl Flay Allster lies sleeping naked, suggesting a sexual relationship. The Japanese Commission for Better Broadcasting reported that viewers filed complaints regarding the <b>scene</b> <b>as</b> the show was aired at 6pm when children would be watching. Mainichi replied by mentioning it should have given more careful consideration to the episode before airing it. The scene was extended in one of the compilation films with John Oppliger noting it expanded the off-screen scene with three shots.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe was memorialized in the Warner Bros. film Jim Thorpe – All-American (1951) {{starring}} Burt Lancaster, with Billy Gray {{performing as}} Thorpe as a child.

The movie included archival footage of the 1912 and 1932 Olympics. Thorpe was seen in one <b>scene</b> <b>as</b> a coaching assistant. It was also distributed in the United Kingdom, where it was called Man of Bronze.|$|E

5|$|Unaware that Novara {{had been}} disabled, and fearing that his ships would be drawn {{too close to}} the Austrian naval base at Cattaro, Acton broke off the pursuit. The {{destroyer}} Acerbi misread the signal, and attempted to launch a torpedo attack, but was driven off by the combined fire of Novara, Saida, and Helgoland. At 12:05, Acton realized the dire situation Novara was in, but by this time, the Sankt Georg group was too close. The Sankt Georg group rendezvoused with Novara, Saida, and Helgoland, and Csepel and Balaton reached the <b>scene</b> <b>as</b> well. The entire group returned to Cattaro together.|$|E
5|$|A similar, strong {{competition}} was established very probably between Gasparo Cairano and Antonio della Porta (Tamagnino), who debuted in Brescia (in documentary terms) along with Cairano with his cycle of twelve Angels {{for the first}} dome of the Santa Maria dei Miracoli, between 24 December 1489 and May 3, 1490. It {{is not clear what}} brought this Milanese artist to Brescia. He belonged to a family of sculptors, and between 1484 and 1489 was known to have worked in Milan and Pavia for the Sforza, in close contact with Giovanni Antonio Amadeo. His debut as a figurative sculptor at the Santa Maria dei Miracoli, however, owed to the Sanmicheli, who typically specialized in the field of decorative sculpture and lacked outside of this field. Note that Gasparo Cairano himself also first appeared on the art <b>scene</b> <b>as</b> a figurative sculptor under the Sanmicheli: he created his sequence of twelve Apostles at the same project.|$|E
5|$|After Thelma leaves Tom, {{he begins}} showing Peter more affection, causing Lois {{to believe it}} to be strange.

This <b>scene,</b> <b>as</b> with all scenes that contain references to Star Wars or its characters, was sent to Lucasfilm for approval, in order to protect copyright.
