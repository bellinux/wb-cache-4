The method links a process model of the sector of interest with other economic models within an optimization framework, although the optimization is an analytical means rather than an end in itself. The approach is flexible and has the advantage that the individual models can be built and used separately, whilst at the same time making the fullest possible use of information (particularly subsystem shadow prices) derived from individual runs...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a contribution to}} the economic literature dealing with local agricultural systems, providing analysis of a study case, namely the agroindustrial <b>sector</b> <b>concerned</b> with the production of mozzarella cheese.

The peculiarity of this sector is organisation in a Consorzio di tutela (Consortium for Supervision), which has obtained authenticated regional trademarks (Doc and Dop). The paper analyses the different development strategies the firms can follow, either continuing production of dairy products according to protocol and thus placing perishable products on a relatively limited market, or accepting the offer of large, multinational, agro-industrial enterprises and marketing a standard industrial product, also on larger, more distant markets.

40|$|Seasonality {{is a key}} aspect for the {{performance}} of the majority of tourism enterprises and a central theme for policy makers. The usual practice of strategy formulation in this area, whilst often involving a sound analysis of objective performance data, largely ignores the perceptions which the businesses concerned have of the seasonality issue. This paper demonstrates that the heterogeneity of attitudes and perceptions in the sector need to be recognised when developing effective strategies for tackling seasonality. An empirical quantitative approach is applied using occupancy data of the serviced accommodation sector in addition to a survey of owner/managers. The findings indicate that an insufficiently detailed level of segmentation of the business <b>sector</b> <b>concerned</b> may lead to ill-focused broad-brush strategies and consequent misallocations of resources. The paper contends that policy makers in this area need information beyond what can be obtained from the usual performance measurement systems...|$|E
40|$|Action {{research}} {{has been used in}} many areas where an understanding of complex social situations has been sought in order {{to improve the quality of}} life. Among these are industrial, health and community work settings. Kurt Lewin, often cited as the originator of action research, used the methodology in his work with people affected by post- war social problems. Action research approaches to educational research were adopted in the late 60 s and early 70 s by the teacher- researcher movement in the secondary education sector. This sought to bring the practising classroom teacher into the research process as the most effective person to identify problems and to find solutions. We believe that an action research approach can contribute very positively to activity within the tertiary <b>sector</b> <b>concerned</b> with teaching quality issues, and with national Teaching Quality Assessment initiatives. As 'reflective practitioners', we can achieve greater ownership of the evaluative process by becoming systematically self-assessing, alongside, and feeding into, external assessment processes...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} paper {{presents the}} results of an analysis of the intensity of competition in the milk and milk products sector in Bulgaria. The analysis is performed by adapting the Porter’s five forces model and based on the specific features of the <b>sector</b> <b>concerned.</b> For this purpose the author accepts the industrial concept of interpretation of competition: two levels of consideration of the competition intensity are differentiated - product class as a whole and separate product categories. Although not going into greater depth, the study reports the need of deepening the analysis by individual product groups, price levels and specific segments. The author proposes a methodological framework by which an analysis of the intensity of competition is conducted. Due to volume limitations of the publication, the emphasis of the paper is on the intensity of competition between existing companies; the barriers to enter and exit the sector are also presented; substitute products are marked briefly. The remaining forces from the five forces model are marked without going into details...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explains}} {{the importance of}} IPRs and examines the factors hindering and those contributing toward enhancing IPRs in Sudan.

The inadequate IPRs protection in Sudan leads to poor national system of innovation, hindering FDI and hindering transfer of technology. The factors contributing toward enhancing IPRs in Sudan include promotion of adequate IPRs legislations and enforcement; planning, commitment to international IPRs agreements; finance, investment and resources; social partnership to encourage IPRs protection, government <b>concern,</b> private <b>sector</b> <b>concern,</b> public awareness, cooperation between universities and industry, institutions setting, coordination and culture for IPRs protection...|$|R

40|$|Labour {{markets in}} welfare states are {{structured}} {{along the lines}} of gender and immigrant & minority statuses. This paper brings novel insights into the issue of ethnic entrepreneurship as a means of sustainable inclusion of immigrants into the labour market by adding a gender dimension. Based on unique longitudinal data, the paper analyses the division of labour and the work incomes of female immigrant entrepreneurs in contrast with male immigrants and native-born Swedes. The results indicate that the division of labour is structured {{along the lines of}} both gender and immigrant status. At first glance, a gender perspective on ethnic entrepreneurship acknowledges persistent inequalities in the labour market. Analysis of entrepreneurship within niches such as the health care sector, however, indicates greater complexity in the entrepreneurial landscape. The paper identifies implications of a nuanced analysis of entrepreneurial research, which recognises diversity along the axes of both immigrant status and gender. Entrepreneurial processes can lead to both exclusion and inclusion of minority groups in the labour market, depending on the <b>sector</b> <b>concerned.</b> Entrepreneurship; gender; immigrant status; segmentation; division of labour...|$|E
40|$|This {{article focuses}} {{on the impact of}} scale economies on whether a market {{solution}} will yield the socially optimum kinds and quantities of commodities in welfare economics. This article develops some models to study various aspects of the relationship between market and optimal resource allocation in the presence of some nonconvexities. The monopoly power, which is a necessary ingredient of markets with nonconvexities, is usually considered to distort resources away from the <b>sector</b> <b>concerned.</b> However, in the analysis monopoly power enables firms to pay fixed costs, and entry cannot be prevented, so the relationship between monopoly power and the direction of market distortion is no longer obvious. In the central case of constant elasticity utility function, the market solution was constrained Pareto optimal, regardless of the value of that elasticity. With variable elasticities, the bias could go either way, and the direction of the bias depended not on how the elasticity of demand changed, but on how the elasticity of utility changed. We suggested that there was some presumption that the market solution would be characterized by too few firms in the monopolistically competitive sector...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} devoted to the case of Algeria, and is based on a computable general {{equilibrium}} model with four sectors model: agriculture, urban private sector (readable simplification industry), the commercial and public sector and the informal sector. The labor market is segmented between skilled and unskilled workers. Our model is a modified version model of AGENOR et al. (2003 and 2007). This is based on empirical studies conducted by the World Bank and the International Labor Office, and has been designed to adapt to the peculiarities of countries Middle East- North Africa. However, in our article, the model of AGENOR et al. was modified in two main ways. The first change was to model endogenously the wages paid to unskilled industrial workers. The second change was to remove any function of elasticities CES-CET. The model thus created was the subject of various simulations. In particular, we applied the shocks on the level of exogenous wage (agricultural wage, minimum wage, wage of skilled industrial workers). Our results show that in Algeria, growth underpinned by the low level of wages. This is the case regardless of the <b>sector</b> <b>concerned.</b> Thus, the will to increase the lowest wages is potentially unfavorable to growth.
