25|$|If {{energy for}} {{hydrogen}} production were available (from wind, solar, fission or fusion nuclear power etc.), {{use of the}} substance for hydrocarbon <b>synfuel</b> production could expand captive use of hydrogen {{by a factor of}} 5 to 10.

It is estimated that 37.7Mt/yr of hydrogen would be sufficient to convert enough domestic coal to liquid fuels to end U.S. dependence on foreign oil importation, and less than half this figure to end dependence on Middle East oil. Coal liquefaction would present significantly worse emissions of carbon dioxide than does the current system of burning fossil petroleum, but it would eliminate the political and economic vulnerabilities inherent in US oil importation before the commercialization of tight oil in North America.|$|E
2500|$|The {{methanol}} {{economy is}} a <b>synfuel</b> production energy plan which may begin with hydrogen production. Hydrogen in a full [...] "hydrogen economy" [...] was initially suggested {{as a way to}} make renewable energy, in non-polluting form, available to automobiles. However, a theoretical alternative to address the same problem is to produce hydrogen centrally and immediately use it to make liquid fuels from a CO2 source. This would eliminate the requirement to transport and store the hydrogen. The source could be CO2 that is produced by fuel-burning power plants. In order to be greenhouse-neutral, the source for CO2 in such a plan would need to be from air, biomass, or other source of CO2 which is already in, or to be released into, the air.

The company is a subsidiary of Basin Electric Power Co-operative. Cenovus is taking ~40% of the <b>synfuels</b> plant’s CO2 capacity. At the plant, CO2 is produced from a Rectisol unit in the gas cleanup train. The CO2 project adds about $30 million of gross revenue to the gasification plant’s cash flow each year.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the market penetration of a competitively produced <b>synfuel,</b> e. g., solar energy, {{in a market}} that is initially dominated by a resource extracting monopoly.

The dynamic interactions between the resource cartel and the <b>synfuel</b> industry are modelled as a differential game; the (open loop) Nash equilibrium is applied to this game. It will be shown that the commodity price will exceed the production costs of the backstop and that the transition from the periods of resource dependence to the backstop technology will be gradual.
