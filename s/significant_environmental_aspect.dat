40|$|Environmental {{management}} system (EMS) {{is a part}} of the {{management system}} that includes the organizational structure, planning activities, responsibilities, practices, procedures, processes and resources for developing, implementing, achieving, reviewing and maintaining the environmental policy. The EMS provides the order and consistency for organizations to adress environmental cocerns through the allocation of resources, assignment of responsibilities, and the ongoing evaluation of practices, procedures and processes. The ISO 14001 requires the implementation of the EMS in accordance with defined, internationally recognized standards. The ISO standard specifies requirements for establishing an environmental policy, determining environmental aspects & impacts of products (activities) services, planning environmental objectives and measurable targets, implementation & operation of programs to meet objectives and targets, checking &corrective action, and management review. The Environmental aspect is an element of organizations activities, product or services that can interact with the environment. A <b>significant</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspect</b> is that with a significant environmental impact. The environmental impact is any change to the environment, whether adverse or beneficial wholly or partially resulting from an oranizations activities, products or services...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} paper {{is focused on}} the study of various environmental aspects and their impacts arising from the Indian manufacturing industries. Our environment is being polluted day by day due to rapid industrialization. Today the delicate ecosystem of our planet is facing a danger of destruction on a scale as never before in the history of mankind. Forests are diminishing at an alarming rate, landmasses are getting eroded, climate {{in different parts of the}} world is undergoing a change due to global warming and clean air and water are increasingly becoming rare commodities. So it is high time to be aware and alert about environmental protection which cannot be done without understanding the environmental aspects. Present study tried to explain the significant environmental aspects arising from Indian manufacturing industries by analyzing the data collected through questionnaire survey. It is observed from collected data that emission to air is most <b>significant</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspect</b> in Indian manufacturing industries in respect to severity i. e. the effect of this environmental aspect is more harmful for human beings. Noise environmental aspect is having more efficiency, probability and duration, it means this environmental aspect is produced in each and every manufacturing company and affects the environment.

Using ISO 14001, schools can reduce their environmental impact, while students become involved in environmental activities. This report shows how an initial environmental review of a pre- and elementary school can be conducted, and how short-term and long-term environmental targets for the <b>significant</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> can be identified. The initial environmental review of Nyckelknippan förskole AB can hopefully provide a basis on which {{the establishment of the}} environmental management system ISO 14001 can be developed. The methodology for the initial environmental review had a starting point of already proposed <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> that were investigated and quantified. A list of environmental laws was compiled and linked to the <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects.</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> were evaluated using an FMEA where the <b>significant</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> were identified; energy consumption, chemical use, accidents, consumables, wastes, internal transportation and education. The proposals on objectives and targets for the <b>significant</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> were linked to the Stockholm County regional environmental objectives and can be further developed together with teachers and students. It is possible to improve the initial environmental review in the future as part of the standard's requirements for continuous improvement, depending on if Nyckelknippan förskole AB chooses to continue the implementation of the environmental management system ISO 14001. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to build up an {{documented}} environmental management system in Konecranes Finland Plc. manufacturing sites. The goal was that after the thesis, the environmental management system would be ready for initial external audit, in which the level of documentation is assessed. Building was started by conducting present state analysis, which assessed the level of present environmental management compared {{to the requirements of}} ISO 14001 standard. Based on the analysis, project plan for thesis work was made. After this, the environmental aspects of production facilities were identified. From the identified aspects, programmes, goals and targets were defined. Specific metrics was proposed to monitor progress. An environmental management organization was defined during the thesis. Finally, all the standard required procedures were defined so Konecranes Finland Plc. could manage its environmental issues as effectively as possible. The most <b>significant</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspect</b> of Konecranes Finland Plc. was identified to be energy efficiency, especially regarding the facilities.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{environmental data}} relating to gravure and offset printing. It {{focuses on the}} printing steps in the production chain of publication printed products. The other steps in the life-cycle of printed products have also been studied {{but they are not}} the subjects of this paper. The study is based on case studies, where almost twenty gravure printers and ten offset printers from around Europe and the United States have been involved. The general, significant environmental aspects of publication printed products have been identified as the following; use of paper, use of energy, consumption (loss) of volatile organic compounds (VOC), including toluene, hazardous waste and environmental management. Transport has also been identified as a <b>significant</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspect</b> for printed products but, to a great extent, its magnitude depends on the particular product. The data collected from printers {{in different parts of the}} world were compared to environmental data provided by offset printers in Sweden, which were mainly taken from coldset printers. This paper presents significant environmental data for a fairly large number of companies representing a considerable part of the printing capacity, not only in Europe but also worldwide. These data can provide guidance for both printers and buyers of printed products working to achieve continual improvements and striving towards more environmentally adapted printed products. To some extent, the data can also be used as reference values, since there are few compilations of data providing a general coverage of printers in different parts of the world. </p...|$|E
40|$|Construction of {{a second}} runway at Manchester Airport (1997 - 2000) {{included}} a £ 17 million environmental package concerned with habitat restoration, relocation of species and translocation of valuable habitat components. One focus was on legally protected vertebrates such as great crested newts and badgers. To this end, a monitoring programme was established to assess earthworm communities (significant prey items for the given protected animals) within areas of translocated grassland. Major upheaval of turf can have negative consequences on soil biota, so its integration with receptor subsoil was essential. The work reported here relates to annual (autumn) monitoring (1998 - 2014) of 4 translocated grassland areas. Digging and hand sorting of soil, followed by vermifuge application to replicated plots was used to extract earthworm specimens. Twelve species of earthworm were recorded, representing litter dwelling, shallow, and deep burrowing ecological groups. Presence of Lumbricus terrestris in vertical burrows showed these grasslands have been integrated into their new locations. Total earthworm numbers fluctuated during the monitoring period, with lowest density at 4 per square metre and highest {{more than a hundred}} times larger. Similarly, biomasses have ranged between 1 g to 110 g per square metre. Significant differences can be attributed to a number of factors including type of translocation undertaken (turf transfer vs. soil alone) and also between grassland sites (wetter lower lying, vs. constructed hillocks). Meteorological data suggests that the most <b>significant</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspect</b> during monitoring was rainfall, with dramatic earthworm reductions in 2003, a year with a particularly dry summer. Great crested newts have been located from soil pits when sampling for earthworms at one of the areas.

Meanwhile, stakeholders focus is being broadened {{and it is now}} important not only to supply a particular product or service but also show that they are actively pursuing an environmental agenda. Companies can use various tools to aid in environmental efforts, but also to demonstrate to the world that the company is actively engaged in environmental activities. One such tool is the environmental standard ISO 14001 which provides the company with guidance and support on how the business must manage its environmental efforts. To show a business' progress in environmental performance, it is advantageous to use environmental performance indicators as they enable stakeholders to easily understand how the business works with environmental issues. Authors in the field explain that the environmental management system propagation is limited in service organizations. It is known that also a service organization contributes to environmental impact in some way. Therefore, it is interesting to examine a service organization's direct environmental impact and to create environmental performance indicators to the organization. This case study has been carried out on a case-company that has the intention to implement an environmental management system. The case-company needs help to identify its environmental aspects, formulate environmental performance indicators and environmental goals and therefore the study's purpose is: to identify a service organizations environmental impact and to develop environmental indicators. This is going to be applied to a technology consulting company. And also identify and set the environmental goals to use in the environmental management system.  To identify the case-company’s environmental impact interviews have been conducted.

40|$|Nowadays, the European Ecodesign Directive {{has emerged}} as a new {{approach}} to integrate environmental concerns into the product design and related processes. Ecodesign aims to minimize environmental impacts throughout the product life cycle, without compromising performances and costs. In addition, the recent Ecodesign Directives require products which are increasingly eco-friendly and eco-efficient, preserving high-performances. It is very important for producers measuring performances, for electric cooking ranges, hobs, ovens, and grills for household use, and a low power consumption of appliances represents a powerful selling point, also in terms of ecodesign requirements. The Ecodesign Directive provides a clear framework about the sustainable design of products and it has been extended in 2009 to all energy-related products, or products with an impact on energy consumption during the use. The European Regulation establishes measures of ecodesign of ovens, hobs, and kitchen hoods, and domestic use and energy efficiency of a product has a <b>significant</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspect</b> in the use phase which is the most impactful in the life cycle. It is important that the product parameters and performances are not affected by ecodesign requirements from a user’s point of view, and the benefits of reducing energy consumption in the use phase should offset the possible environmental impact in the production stage. Accurate measurements of cooking appliance performance are essential to help the industry to produce more energy efficient appliances. The development of ecodriven products requires ecoinnovation and ecodesign tools to support the sustainability improvement. The ecodesign tools should be practical and focused on specific ecoobjectives in order to be largely diffused. The main scope of this paper is the development, implementation, and testing of an innovative tool, which could be an improvement for the sustainable design of induction hobs. In particular, a prototypical software tool is developed in order to simulate the energy performances of the induction hobs. The tool is focused on a multiphysics model which is able to simulate the energy performances and the efficiency of induction hobs starting from the design data. The multiphysics model is composed by an electromagnetic simulation and a thermal simulation. The electromagnetic simulation is able to calculate the eddy current induced in the pot, which leads to the Joule heating of material. The thermal simulation is able to measure the energy consumption during the operational phase. The Joule heating caused from the eddy currents is the output of electromagnetic simulation and the input of thermal ones. The aims of the paper are the development of integrated tools and methodologies of virtual prototyping {{in the context of the}} ecodesign. This tool could be a revolutionary instrument in the field of industrial engineering and it gives consideration to the environmental aspects of product design and focus on the ecodesign of energy-related products, in order to achieve a reduced environmental impact...|$|E

40|$|The {{forests are}} {{essential}} for healthy environment. Trees which {{are part of the}} forest help to stabilize the forest soil, improve soil fertility, reduce the velocity of wind, protect watershed and reduce the amount of carbon released into the atmosphere. Many industries use trees as raw materials and in most cases impact the environment, but there are great differences in the impact they make. There is a need therefore to continually evaluate the operational activities of these industries to ensure that the environment is protected. The use of environmental management systems like ISO and EMAS standards has helped in the evaluation of organizations and industries. In this thesis, two sawmills Iretunde and Irepodun in Etsako-West local government area Edo state Nigeria were evaluated with the aim to determine their operational activities and how the environment is being affected by them. Subaims were to determine the most <b>significant</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> of the sawmill and their organizational structure.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to design and assess an {{effective}} approach for a small or medium size organization to determine appropriate operational controls for its <b>significant</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> as part of developing and implementing an ISO 14001 - type environmental management system. This new approach {{was determined to be}} necessary due to the generic nature and broad applicability of the ISO 14001 standard, the lack of appropriate methodology in the professional literature, and the lack of related knowledge and ability in most small or medium sized organizations. As controlling and influencing operations is a vital characteristic of an effective environmental management system, currently available federal and state guidance manuals for small or medium size environmental management systems were reviewed to determine the support that they provided in this area. Unfortunately, these guidance manuals lacked specific direction for identifying potential operational controls. Working with six organizations participating in the Monroe County Strategic Environmental Management Initiative, a new approach was developed and utilized to determine appropriate operational controls for each organization 2 ̆ 7 s <b>significant</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> as part of its environmental management system development and implementation. This approach employed the use of: 1) An Operational Control Flowchart (developed for this thesis); 2) Decision Block Descriptions for the Operational Control Flowchart (developed in support of the Operational Control Flowchart); and 3) A cost-benefit analysis. Additionally, it was found that identifying and evaluating operational controls for one obvious <b>environmental</b> <b>aspect</b> in each organization before the organization 2 ̆ 7 s <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> were competitively evaluated for significance, provided a convincing example for skeptical participants and enhanced the EMS implementation process. The new approach began by first identifying potential operational controls for all identified significant aspects. Next, a practical cost-benefit analysis was performed for each of the potential operational controls before finalizing performance objectives and targets. As the potential operational controls were found to provide an economic as well as an environmental benefit, the MCSEMI participating organizations were eager to implement them and take advantage of the cost and environmental benefits...|$|R
40|$|All organisations {{make some}} {{contribution}} to the {{degradation of the environment}} through their use of resources and production of waste. Environmental management systems (EMS) standards can provide a tool for companies to systematically reduce their environmental impacts. ISO 14001 was published in 1996. This fitted in with plans of the case study company to take proactive action in this area, even though there was no legislative requirement for them to do so. As EMS implementation was a new area at the time, appropriate methodologies were developed to address different aspects of the implementation, and ISO 14001 was successfully implemented in the company. The results of the primary research included: ♦ Drawing up a methodology for identifying and interpreting the environmental legislation that may {{have an impact on the}} organisation and compiling a register of such regulations. ♦ Developing a robust methodology for assessing <b>significant</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> and impacts and applying this to the software company. ♦ Establishing objectives and targets for those aspects identified as <b>significant</b> and implementing <b>environmental</b> management programmes to meet these. ♦ Developing an internal environmental audit procedure based on auditing against the significant aspects. ♦ Integrating areas of the EMS with the existing quality management system in order to avoid duplication of effort. ♦ Undergoing an external assessment process in order to achieve certification of the system.

Whilst humanity is faced with the challenge of reducing the impact of transport on the environment without losing the benefits to society and economies, a holistic approach to the environmental management of the logistic chain emerges as a necessity. The thesis follows a multi-method and interdisciplinary, phased pathway in order to (1) assess the feasibility and practicability of delivering sustainable development through such a chain, (2) address the challenges inherent to its implementation, and (3) develop a model that guides the development and delivery of an environmental management system specifically focussed on the logistic chain. Following an environmental management based methodology, the <b>significant</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> of the logistic chain operations are identified and analysed. Focus is then placed on the major players in the chain (transport buyers, providers and operators) and, in particular, on selected practices that have the potential to improve chain environmental performance and guide the future trends of the sector's response. Seaports are selected for purposes of evaluation and validation of various options as they arguably represent the major and most complex of the logistic nodes in terms of intense intermodal and multi-actor interest.

50|$|Conventionally, {{environmental}} management systems have always addressed the impacts of products on local surroundings. ISO 14001 (ISO 14001:3) provides a formalized framework for managing <b>significant</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> and improving <b>environmental</b> performance through a ‘‘Plan, Do, Check, Review’’ continual improvement cycle.During the phase of product planning, consumer demands and market opportunities are evaluated. At this time a product description and execution plans for a successful program launch are developed and product requirements are defined.During the phase of product development, specific design specifications are finalized, models are built, and designs are reviewed and released for manufacture planning. Once manufacturing begins, the product is commercially launched for general availability and volume deployed to the marketplace. Once a prototype is available, LCA {{is used as a}} fundamental standard to identify <b>significant</b> social and <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> and quantify <b>environmental</b> impact.Once a product is launched into market and becomes commercialized, it enters the maturity phase, which means that the sales and the profits both reach the peak. The maturity phase contains two stages: during the first stage of maturity, the customer is utilizing the product. Modifications may still be made to the product to enhance or change it. The product enters the second stage of maturity when it approaches near to the decline phase. Where applicable, end-of-life products are taken back and subsequently reused or recycled efficiently. While being a legal requirement in the EU, the take back of end-of-life products offers the chance to review the final life cycle stage of a product through direct contact with recyclers. This knowledge can then be applied to future designs and product improvement.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{identify}} waste generated within the territories of tourist destinations in Carpathian Mountains in Ukraine and to classify it for the use of effective waste management methods. The dynamics of municipal waste generation in tourist destinations in Carpathian region has been analyzed. The sources of waste generation in tourist activities have been identified and classified by the criterion of their further use. The methods of waste management within the tourist destinations in Carpathian region have been proposed. The problem of tourist destinations waste has been identified as one of the <b>significant</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> of tourism industry. Recommendations for implementation of the waste management methods can form the basis of waste management programs within the tourist destinations in the Carpathians. To achieve the goal and to solve the identified tasks a range of research methods have been used in the study: praximetric method (analysis of research experience) and summarizing the information of printed sources on <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> of the tourism industry and the problems of waste management within tourist destinations; comparative analysis has been used for identification of quantitative indicators and dynamics of municipal waste generation; specific search method has been used for identifying, selecting, theoretical analysis, classification of the waste generated in tourist destinations and calculation of their generated amount...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{environmental}} management systems, and objectives-led corporate management {{have become a}} widespread phenomenon today. Identification and assessment of an organisation’s <b>significant</b> (<b>environmental)</b> <b>aspects</b> is crucial within this work. Identification and especially assessment of significant aspects is often considered as a problematic step in many organisations. There are no generally accepted methods how to undertake this crucial step. Corporate management towards sustainable development needs to concern {{all members of the}} organisation to be successful. This study presents a management information system (MIS) for this purpose. The specific purpose is to develop a method for assessment of significant aspects that account for different viewpoints and values within the organisation. Methods used for this assessment has been tested through different procedures. The result of this study shows that a crossfunctional group should use the MIS, when the variables in the MIS are not merged together, and the result presented not aggregated. The tool could be used for both strategic and operative decisions. The MIS contributes with a new way of thinking, and opens a way for a holistic view within the company. The MIS may help to remove some of people’s selective perceptions and increase the problemsolving capacities within the company...|$|R
40|$|A {{new tool}} to assist port {{authorities}} in identifying aspects and in assessing their significance (TEAP) has been developed. The present research demonstrates that {{although there is}} a high percentage of European ports that have already identified their <b>Significant</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Aspects</b> (SEA), most of these ports do not use any standardized method. This suggests that some of the procedures used may not necessarily be science-based, systematic in approach or appropriate for the purpose of implementing effective environmental management. For the port sector as a whole, where the free-exchange of environmental information and experience is an established policy of the European Sea Ports Organization's (ESPO) and the EcoPorts Network, developing a tool to assist ports in identifying SEAs can be very useful. This method has been developed in the framework of the PERSEUS research project, after analysing the strengths, weaknesses and challenges of the existing techniques, the recommendations from the Environmental Management System (EMS) standards and the advice of specialists. This is a computer-based tool (www. eports. cat) that provides a quick calculation and result, and it is designed to be as user-friendly as possible in order to facilitate its completion by the user (i. e. port environmental manager). This methodology comprises two main steps, firstly the identification of the major <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> that may be generated in a port, and secondly, assessing their significance. This tool can be applied to any type of port but it provides specific results for each one. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author’s final draft...|$|R

The {{activities}} {{that allow the}} operation of the Deep Drilling Geothermal Resources Service Center Area inevitably generate; <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> (EA), as well as, <b>significant</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> (SEA); which produce negative impacts on the environment and the people near the project. The lack of knowledge of these issues by the company, was the reason why field visits took place for three months, to know in detail how works each of the processes on that department. Subsequently, all the acquired knowledge was reflected in the execution of flowcharts and through these, easily they identified, 28 EA,that are relating to the activities of the different processes that deep drilling area has. Once identified the EA, an 2 evaluation was carried out, with a criteria significance matrix and an evaluation of legislation compliance matrix. It resulted in the existence of 5 SEAs; water consumption, the dust particles generation in suspension (cement and esferilita), cement effluent generation, the diesel consumption and its use and the noise emission. To eliminate or minimize the environmental impacts produced by the SEAs, that do not have control measures, the establishment of measures of technology, feasible and efficient control was proposed, these proposals are backed with the technical staff criteria, ensuring, it can be achieved efficiently the reduction of the environmental impacts generated by the company.

40|$|Lithuanian {{food and}} drink sector of {{industry}} is characterized by high energy intensity, which is 29 % higher than the EU average. At the confectionary plant chosen for the experiment, an environmental impact has been controlled and its maximum managed by creating different procedures to reduce pollution. Assessment of the plant's environmental costs has revealed that the energy costs amount to {{main part of the}} environmental ones (up to 55. 4 %). In recent years several energy efficiency projects have been implemented allowing minimizing the plant's energy intensity up to 15 %. An algorithm of feasibility analysis of increasing thermal energy efficiency of the plant was suggested which could also be applied to other food industry plants. Demand for heat energy within the plant was evaluated for each technological process; the fuel and energy balance of the plant boiler-house was drawn up. It was revealed that huge heat energy losses were made during heat energy production and usage. During the research period a control system of <b>significant</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> was suggested, its objective function was estimated. Several environmental alternatives were suggested for optimization of the heat energy production processes. Three projects were chosen for the feasibility analysis. Results of technical, economic and environmental evaluations of Cleaner Production (CP) innovations as well as conclusions made are presented in this article. <br /...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{project is}} a {{continuation}} of a project that was previously done at KTHenvironmental management course during Fall 2006 semester at Veidekke to identify the deficit and the flaws of the current way of dealing with the environmental matters. The purpose of this thesis project is to plan the environmental management system according toISO 14001 standards specifically for Veidekke Anläggning Öst AB. The first part of the work was to identify the <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> that relate to the activities and the processes at Veidekke Anläggning’s projects. From these <b>aspects,</b> the <b>significant</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> would be identified, in order to act upon them, and minimize the environmental risks as much as possible. An environmental management system is mainly a combination of an environmental policy, environmental requirements, environmental goals, and an emergency response plan. So in order for the environmental goals to be set, an accurate identification of the aspects needs to occur before the process of building an environmental management system starts. Then proper solutions and recommendations will be provided in order to motivate the employees at Veidekke Anläggning Öst to increase their environmental awareness and {{to take responsibility for their}} actions. All employees need to undergo a series of educational courses in order to, change their behaviour towards the environment, and to take environmental responsibility for thecompany. The basic foundation to start building an environmental management system is to provide the employees with the necessary environmental knowledge, and the motivation to do the best they can. The most important factor is the willingness of the top management to change. www. ima. kth. s...|$|R
