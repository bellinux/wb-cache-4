40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of {{environmental}} aspects on internal migration flows in Brazil, focusing specifically on drought. Internal migration in Brazil is analyzed by using bilateral migration rates between states. The palmer drought severity index {{is used as a}} measurement of drought. The results show that drought has a significant effect on inter-state migration flows in Brazil. An increase in drought in the state of origin or a decrease in drought in the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> increases bilateral migration at a decreasing rate. Two other environmental variables that are analyzed are land degradation and deforestation. Based on the results of two different measures of deforestation, the suggestion was made that in general out-migration decreases with deforestation due to increased work-opportunities. However when only deforestation because of agricultural land expansion is considered, this effect will not exceed the negative effects of deforestation. Concerning land degradation, no clear evidence was found for its expected effect on migration...|$|E

Data {{for this research}} came from a two-wave national probability sample survey of persons aged 60 and over conducted between 1987 and 1990 in Japan. The study focuses on the transitions from two <b>states</b> <b>of</b> origin, "not disabled " and "disabled, " to three <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination,</b> "not disabled, " "disabled, " and "dead. " Through multinomial logit analyses, the effects of sociodemographic factors, social relationships, health, and health behavior on transitions in functional status were examined.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} how a {{state can}} reconstruct its function to provide safety to its constituent population after having become a destination country of international population movements (IPM). First, the paper considers {{why it is}} the responsibility of a state to provide safety to its constituent population. Second, using an International Political Economy perspective, it is claimed that a change in economic circumstances will lead to a change in the political domain. Third, when they accept new norms, actors in world politics could change their ways of action. Fourth, if a norm alternative to nationalism is formulated, the state could alter its action to provide safety to foreign nationals. Fifth, a state’s understanding of ‘the constituent population of a society ’ can be modified in accordance with a changing knowledge of the characteristics of a state’s boundaries. It is concluded that a state’s responsibility to provide safety to its constituent population should remain unchanged, but an understanding of the form of such a population has to be updated. A <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> country of IPM should characterize the foreign nationals within its territory as a ‘transterritorial public’, and provide safety to them just as it would to its nationals...|$|E
40|$|What is {{the cost}} of {{off-site}} hazardous waste disposal? In addition to paying for disposal fees and shipments costs, generators of hazardous waste can potentially be held liable for the cost of cleanup if the waste disposal site contaminates the environment after closure or abandonment and thus falls under the federal or state Superfund legislation. This paper empirically examines the sensitivity of individual hazardous waste generators to these categories of costs, exploiting the variation across states in factors influencing disposal costs, and {{in the structure of the}} liability imposed on waste generators under certain circumstances by state laws. We fit nested logit models to predict the waste management method (incineration or landfill disposal) and the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination</b> for shipments of halogenated solvent waste used for metal cleaning in manufacturing and reported in the Toxic Release Inventory in 1988 – 1990. Waste generators respond to transportation costs and to proxies for current disposal costs. Generators also find the concurrent presence of strict and joint-and-several liability a deterrent, but this deterrent effect does not vary with the wealth of the firm or the volume of the waste shipped.

40|$|Asylum {{is being}} {{gradually}} denuded {{of the national}} institutional mechanisms (judicial, legislative and administrative) that {{provide the framework for}} a fair and effective asylum hearing. In this sense, there is an ongoing ‘denationalization’ or ‘deformalization’ of the asylum process. This chapter critically examines one of the linchpins of this trend: the erection of pre-entry measures at ports of embarkation in order to prevent asylum seekers from physically accessing the territory of the state. Pre-entry measures comprise the core requirement that foreigners possess an entry visa granting permission to enter the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination.</b> Visa requirements are increasingly implemented by immigration officials posted abroad or by officials of transit countries pursuant to bilateral agreements (so-called ‘juxtaposed’ immigration controls). Private carriers, which are subject to sanctions if they bring persons to a country who do not have permission to enter, also engage in a form of de facto immigration control on behalf of states. These measures constitute a type of ‘externalized’ or ‘exported’ border that pushes the immigration boundaries of the state as far from its physical boundaries as possible. Pre-entry measures have a crippling impact on the ability of asylum seekers to access the territory of states to claim asylum. In effect, states have ‘externalized’ asylum by replacing the legal obligation on states to protect refugees arriving at ports of entry with what are perceived to be no more than moral obligations towards asylum seekers arriving at the external border of the state...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the notion of {{vulnerability}} of migrants, with respect to the realities of two countries, the United States and Mexico. The vulnerability of migrants is understood as a heterogeneously imposed condition of powerlessness. This is {{based on the premise that}} migrants are inherently vulnerable as subjects of human rights from the point of their departure as they leave home to initiate their migration. That is, any human being is less vulnerable at home than after she leaves home to become a migrant. The same applies to a sociological extension of the notion of home [...] a community of origin. The same person that migrates has more resources to defend or protect herself when she is at home prior to moving elsewhere than after the outward movement has taken place. The assertion is less salient, however, when one attempts to expand its logic to propose that the further away a migrant is from home, the more vulnerable she is. This might be more true for internal than for international migration, to the extent that the notion of migrants’ vulnerability is linked to their social and political relations with the members of the society within their actual location and to the corresponding national State. When linking to the latter, the notion of a migrant’s vulnerability becomes altered; in as much as the migrant becomes an international one, by virtue of entering a country other than her own. Thus, the initial assertion that the vulnerability of migrants is directly related to their geographical distance from home should be restricted to the case of internal migration. In summary, the crossing of an international border alters the relation between the migrant and the <b>State</b> or <b>States</b> <b>of</b> her <b>destination,</b> making it necessary to distinguish between the ‘internal’ (vis-a-vis the national <b>State</b> <b>of</b> origin) and the ‘international’ (vis-a-vis the <b>State</b> or <b>States</b> <b>of</b> <b>destination)</b> vulnerability <b>of</b> migrants. Such a distinction has to do with the different nature <b>of</b> the corresponding <b>State’s</b> accountability regarding the protection of human rights from which the notion of migrants’ vulnerability is derived. In the case of the “internal” vulnerability, the corresponding <b>State</b> <b>of</b> origin is accountable to its nationals (in accordance with its own national laws) in its duties to protect the human rights (usually in the form of protecting its citizens’ constitutional rights) of its subjects. In the case of “international” vulnerability, the State’s accountability, in this case in the destination country, is to the international community, usually represented by the United Nations or its agencies, in accordance with international law...|$|R
