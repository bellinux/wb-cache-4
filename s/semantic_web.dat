25|$|Currently one of {{the most}} active areas of {{knowledge}} representation research are projects associated with the <b>semantic</b> <b>web.</b> The <b>semantic</b> <b>web</b> seeks to add a layer of semantics (meaning) on top of the current Internet. Rather than indexing web sites and pages via keywords, the <b>semantic</b> <b>web</b> creates large ontologies of concepts. Searching for a concept will be more effective than traditional text only searches. Frame languages and automatic classification play a big part in the vision for the future <b>semantic</b> <b>web.</b> The automatic classification gives developers technology to provide order on a constantly evolving network of knowledge. Defining ontologies that are static and incapable of evolving on the fly would be very limiting for Internet-based systems. The classifier technology provides the ability to deal with the dynamic environment of the Internet.|$|E

(3) Ordersorted terms permit typed variables via Web links into taxonomies such as RDF Schema class hierarchies, thus reusing the <b>Semantic</b> <b>Web's</b> lightweight ontologies. Besides introducing the first sublanguage with the Positional-Roled (ASCII) syntax, all three sublanguages are introduced with the OO RuleML (XML) syntax.

The objects themselves do not converse, but they may now be referred to by other agents, such as powerful centralized servers acting for their human owners.Integration with the Internet implies that devices will use an IP address as a unique identifier. Due to the limited address space of IPv4 (which allows for 4.3 billion unique addresses), objects in the IoT will have to use the next generation of the Internet protocol (IPv6) to scale to the extremely large address space required.|$|E

A classifier can infer new classes and dynamically change the ontology as new information becomes available. This capability is ideal for the ever changing and evolving information space of the Internet.|$|E
