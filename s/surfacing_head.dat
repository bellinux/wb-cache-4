40|$|Complete inflow hydrographs for inflow {{events to}} {{reservoirs}} cannot be determined from stage recorder records alone, unless seepage losses from the reservoir are known. Determination {{of the actual}} magnitude of the hydrograph and duration of the inflow recession requires knowledge of the changes of seepage rates with <b>surface</b> <b>head</b> in the reservoirs. This thesis develops three independent methods of determining seepage under saturated flow conditions from stage recorder and pan evaporation records: the application of Darcy's Law; the application of extrapolated curves of storage decline versus pan evaporation to zero pan evaporation; {{and the application of}} a three dimensional regression model. It is felt that the Darcy method produces the most accurate results, and that the extrapolation method produces the least accurate results. The extrapolation method requires several averaging methods contributing to its inaccuracy. The seepage rates obtained on Tank 2, Atterbury watershed ranged from 1. 5 x l 0 ^- 4 cfs for two feet of <b>surface</b> <b>head</b> and a reservoir capacity of 0. 60 acre-feet to approximately 1. 5 cfs for nine foet of <b>surface</b> <b>head</b> and a reservoir capacity of 22 acre-feet. The application of the seepage curve derived by the Darcy method produced a summer inflow hydrograph recession of three and one-half hours, and a winter inflow hydrograph recession of four and one-half hours, as compared with durations of two and one-half and four hours respectively for the uncorrected summer and winter hydrographs...|$|R

For allocation of knots belonging to vertices of triangulation of the model, the limiting conditions are specified in the method of Monte-Carlo used for their generation.

40|$|Rail defects are {{currently}} managed mainly by ultrasonic rail defect detection. Detecting and managing transverse cracks caused in rail heads {{is particularly important}} because they may affect transport. In general, a transverse crack branches off from a horizontal crack called a squat as shown in Fig. 1 and develops toward {{the bottom of the}} rail. In on-site ultrasonic defect detection, transverse cracks are sometimes difficult to detect because of damage on or under the rail <b>surface</b> (<b>head</b> checks or horizontal cracks) or rail head deformation due to wear. There was also a need for longitudinal continuous detection. In light of those, we have developed a rail defect detection device that detects defects from the upper fishing surface of the rail head (hereinafter, “underside of the rail head”) using phased array technology...|$|R

40|$|An {{analytic}} {{method is}} presented to estimate the evolution of electrical charge distribution inside the human brain related to the evoked potentials observed on the <b>head</b> <b>surface.</b> A three-layered concentric spherical human head model is adopted to express {{the relation between the}} observed potentials on the <b>head</b> <b>surface</b> and the spatial charge distribution inside the brain. In this context an integral equation associated with the three-layered concentric head model Green's function is employed. Assuming the electric potentials are measured on the <b>head</b> <b>surface,</b> the charge distributions inside the human brain are computed by solving an inverse problem. To this end the Green's function integral equation is inverted by using an algebraic reconstruction technique widely employed in X-ray tomography imaging. The accuracy of the proposed technique is examined by employing computer simulations and by checking the self-consistency of the developed algorithm...|$|R
