50|$|Startup accelerators, {{also known}} as <b>seed</b> <b>accelerators,</b> are fixed-term, cohort-based programs, that include mentorship and {{educational}} components and culminate in a public pitch event or demo day. While traditional business incubators are often government-funded, generally take no equity, and focus on biotech, financial technology ("FinTech"), medical technology ("MedTech"), clean tech or product-centric companies, accelerators can be either privately or publicly funded and focus {{on a wide range}} of industries. Unlike business incubators, the application process for startup accelerators is open to anyone, but highly competitive. There are specific types of startup accelerators, such as corporate accelerator, which are often subsidiaries or programs of larger corporations that act like startup accelerators.|$|R

40|$|AbstractA compact seeded {{terahertz}} (THz) free-electron laser (FEL) amplifier {{is under}} {{development at the}} Institute of Advanced Energy, Kyoto University. The system consists of a 1. 6 -cell S-band BNL-type photocathode radio frequency (RF) gun, a focusing solenoid magnet, a magnetic bunch compressor, focusing quadrupoles, a short planar undulator and a THz parametric generator for <b>seeding.</b> The <b>accelerator</b> system will generate a high brightness ultra-short electron bunch injected to the short undulator. Since characteristics of the emitted radiation strongly depend on the electron beam properties, the beam dynamics of the system has been investigated. As the result, the system should be operated at the high accelerating voltage of 80 MV/m to avoid the space-charge effect which causes serious bunch lengthening. The laser with the uniform temporal distribution and the injection phase of 12 degree is suitable for the bunch compression in the chicane. This condition provides the electron beam injected to the undulator with the peak current of more than 300 A and the FWHM bunch length of 0. 36 ps at the bunch charge of 200 pC...|$|R
