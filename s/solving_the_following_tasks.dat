Methods general scientific methods of systemic and comparative analysis economicstatistical and dynamic analysis of economic processes and phenomena. 	Results nowadays managing the insolvency risk is relevant for any company regardless of the economy sector. Instability manifests itself through {{the uncertainty of the}} directions of the external environment changes and their high frequency. Analysis of the economic literature showed that currently there is no single approach to systematization of methods for insolvency risk prediction which means that there is no objective view on tools {{that can be used to}} monitor the insolvency risk. In this respect scientific and practical search of representative indicators for the formalization of the models predicting the insolvency is very important. Therefore <b>the</b> study has <b>solved</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>tasks</b> defined <b>the</b> nature of the insolvency risk and its identification in the process of financial relations in management system proved the representativeness of the indicators in the insolvency risk prediction and formed the model of the risk insolvency prediction. 	Scientific novelty grounding the model of risk insolvency prediction. 	Practical significance development of a theoretical framework to address issues arising in the diagnosis of insolvent enterprises and application of the results obtained in the practice of the bankruptcy institution bodies. The presented model allows to predict the insolvency risk of the enterprise through the general development trend and the fluctuation boundaries of bankruptcy risk to determine the significance of each indicatorfactor its quantitative impact and therefore to avoid the risk of the enterprise insolvency. 	nbs...|$|R

To improve the efficiency of public administration should be effective monitoring system that can detect deviations from the planned strategic development goals, unseemly level of its operation determines the target of work, which is to establish the condition of the state financial audit in Ukraine and the definition of new uncontrollable earlier objects which are managed the state apparatus, the identification of which will improve the functionality of the system of state financial audit in Ukraine. In order to achieve the goals you need to <b>solve</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>tasks.</b> First, should set a condition of the state economic management in Ukraine and determine the public authorities, which are subjects to implementing control functions of public administration. Second, determine the resources that have the public interest and should be controlled by the state. Third, determine the composition of objects and install a condition of government auditing system in order to improve the efficiency of these next control measures of the Accounting Chamber of Ukraine and the State Audit Service of Ukraine. The methodological basis of the study is the dialectical method, which is to implement research of financial audit in public administration, its relationship with other forms of control exercised by the state; systematic analysis of financial and economic processes, which is carrying out researching of the state financial audit in the system of relations arising between economic entities of the public and private sectors; methods of retrospective and comparative analysis of experience within the objective focus in the organization of state financial audit on the territory of Ukraine; evaluation and generalization which consists of summarize the results and development proposals of improvement of financial audit system. Scientific results of the study is to establish the condition of the state management of economy of Ukraine, which needs reform, which will can ensure the growth of socio-economic development indicators. Determined the public authorities that are subjects to implementing control functions of public administration and the resources that have the public interest and should be controlled by the state. Besides were identified the composition of objects and established the condition of functioning state government auditing system, which helped determine the content of the concept of transformation of public audit, which unlike existing is accounted a full list of its facilities and is based on scientific principles of realization. Practical meaning. The lack of an effective and efficient system of public audit as a management function does not provide the growth of social and economic standards, deepens economic crisis, which is reflected in the reduction in real incomes and economic decline of the state as a whole. Determining the condition to calculate the required amount of public financial resources as an object of state financial audit is a key condition, which allows for a fresh look at the activities of bodies which are empowered to monitor compliance with financial discipline of economic entities in Ukraine. Value/originality. Received data to determine the condition of state financial audit and management, state audit objects, components of public finances and their confrontation in order to compare and identify differences in the volume under control and actual financial resources makes it possible to assess the working results of supreme audit institutions in Ukraine...|$|R
40|$|The {{aggregate}} power of all {{resources on the}} Internet is enormous. The Internet {{can be viewed as}} a massive virtual organization that holds tremendous amounts of information and resources with different ownerships. However, little is known about how to run this organization efficiently. This dissertation studies the problems of distributed task and resource allocation among self-interested agents in virtual organizations. The developed solutions are not allocation mechanisms that can be imposed by a centralized designer, but decentralized interaction mechanisms that provide incentives to self-interested agents to behave cooperatively. These mechanisms also take computational tractability into consideration due to the inherent complexity of distributed task and resource allocation problems. Targeted allocation mechanisms can achieve global task allocation efficiency in a virtual organization and establish stable resource-sharing communities based on agents???????????? own decisions about whether or not to behave cooperatively. This high level goal requires <b>solving</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> problems: synthetic <b>task</b> allocation, decentralized coalition formation and automated multiparty negotiation. For synthetic task allocation, in which each task needs to be accomplished by a virtual team composed of self-interested agents from different real organizations, my approach is to formalize the synthetic task allocation problem as an algorithmic mechanism design optimization problem. I have developed two approximation mechanisms that I prove are incentive compatible for a synthetic task allocation problem. This dissertation also develops a decentralized coalition formation mechanism, which is based on explicit negotiation among self-interested agents. Each agent makes its own decisions about whether or not to join a candidate coalition. The resulting coalitions are stable in the core in terms of coalition rationality. I have applied this mechanism to form resource sharing coalitions in computational grids and buyer coalitions in electronic markets. The developed negotiation mechanism in the decentralized coalition formation mechanism realizes automated multilateral negotiation among self-interested agents who have symmetric authority (i. e., no mediator exists and agents are peers). In combination, the decentralized allocation mechanisms presented in this dissertation lay a foundation for realizing automated resource management in open and scalable virtual organizations...|$|R

Abstract: We study {{randomized}} algorithms {{that take}} as input a set S of n keys from some large universe Uor {{a set of}} n key-value pairs, associating each key from S with a specific value, and build a data structure that <b>solves</b> one of <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>tasks.</b> On calling <b>the</b> operation lookup for a key x from U: * Decide set membership with respect to S (membership tester). * If x is in S, then return the value associated with x. If x is in U-S, then return either some specific value interpreted as “x is not in S” (dictionary), or some arbitrary value (retrieval data structure). * If x is in S, then return a natural number associated with x, from a range with size close to n, where for all elements of S the numbers are pairwise distinct. The numbers for elements x from U-S are arbitrary (perfect hash function). The data structures that we cover are variations of cuckoo hashing and Bloomier filterwhich have the same simple structure. They consist of a table with m cells, each capable of holding entries of size r bits, {{as well as a}} constant number of hash functions, which are used to map the elements from U to a constant number of table cells. Assuming fully random hash functions, we will discuss how the data structures can be constructed in time linear in n, and what load n/mor space consumption m·r can be achieved in trade-off with the time for lookup. This leads to the question whether a random bipartite graph with n nodes (keys) on the left, m nodes (cells) on the right,and edges determined by the hash functions, asymptotically almost surely hasa matching of a certain type, and furthermore, how such a matching can be calculated efficiently. The focus of this thesis concerns: * optimizing the lookup time for dictionary and membership tester (based on cuckoo hashing) with respect to: (i) a bound on the average number of cell probes, (ii) the expected number of page accesses in a setting where the table (memory) is subdivided into pages of the same size. * minimizing the space usage of the retrieval data structure and perfect hash function (based on Bloomier filter), when for each key the number of cell probes for lookup is upper bounded by a constant. * an efficient simulation of fully random hash functions as needed by the data structures...|$|R
