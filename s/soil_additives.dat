2500|$|The Negev is a rocky desert. It is a {{melange of}} brown, rocky, dusty {{mountains}} interrupted by wadis (dry riverbeds that bloom briefly after rain) and deep craters. It can be split into five different ecological regions: northern, western and central Negev, the high plateau and the Arabah Valley. The northern Negev, or Mediterranean zone, receives 300mm of rain annually and has fairly fertile soils. The western Negev receives 250mm of rain per year, with light and partially sandy soils. Sand dunes can reach heights {{of up to}} 30 metres here. Home {{to the city of}} Beersheba, the central Negev has an annual precipitation of 200mm and is characterized by impervious soil, known as loess, allowing minimum penetration of water with greater soil erosion and water runoff. The high plateau area of Negev Mountains/Ramat HaNegev ( [...] , The Negev Heights) stands between 370 metres and 520 metres above sea level with extreme temperatures in summer and winter. The area gets 100mm of rain per year, with inferior and partially salty soils. The Arabah Valley along the Jordanian border stretches 180km from Eilat in the south to the tip of the Dead Sea in the north. The Arabah Valley is very arid with barely 50mm of rain annually. It has inferior soils in which little can grow without irrigation and special <b>soil</b> <b>additives.</b>|$|E

They are more environmentally friendly {{than many other}} chemical <b>soil</b> <b>additives,</b> and can achieve {{the same amount of}} strengthening at much lower concentrations. Increasing use of biopolymers could offset the carbon dioxide emissions associated with cement production, which can be as high as 1.25 tons of carbon dioxide per ton of cement.|$|E

Plants for our experiments were grown on contaminated soil of Příbram area. Biomass of these plants was used to prepare biochar, {{which could be used}} then as a <b>soil</b> <b>additive</b> and due to its characteristics, can be able to immobilize risk elements in soil. The experiment was focused on the biochar preparation. There was observed the effect of the type of biomass and the final temperature on specific surface area and yield of biochar: properties limit its application as a <b>soil</b> <b>additive.</b> While the final temperature increased, the specific surface area increased and the yield of biochar decrease. The highest surface area was found at biochar from wood mixture...|$|R

Reusing on-site organic materials will decrease the need for purchasing other <b>soil</b> <b>additives.</b>|$|E
5000|$|When {{creating}} new roads or widening current roads, the Nevada Department of Transportation will reserve topsoil and native plants for donation. These materials {{can be used}} by home gardeners or for large-scale agricultural operations to supplement or replace imported materials. This decreases the need to import soil and plants that may disturb the ecosystem. Native plants and soil may also be better suited to local weather conditions and require less water and fewer <b>soil</b> <b>additives</b> (fertilizers).|$|E
50|$|Synthetic {{polymers}} began replacing other chemical binders for {{soil stabilization}} in {{agriculture in the}} late 20th century. Compared to traditional chemical binders, polymer <b>soil</b> <b>additives</b> can achieve {{the same amount of}} strengthening at much lower concentrations - for example, mixtures of 0.5-1% of various biopolymers have strength levels that match or exceed those of 10% cement mixtures in soils. Synthetic polymers, including geopolymers, and biopolymers have been tested for their beneficial interactions with soils. Methods for introducing polymers into soils include mixing, injection, spraying, and grouting. Liquid polymers, sold as concentrated solutions, can be applied deep within the soil through pressure injection or applied directly to uncompacted soil.|$|E

5000|$|H. serrata is best {{grown in}} rich, medium moisture, well-drained soils in partial shade. It tolerates full sun only if grown with {{consistently}} moist soils. Soil pH affects the flower {{color in the}} same manner as it does with H. macrophylla — namely, bluish in highly acidic soils and lilac to pink in slightly acidic to alkaline soils. Limited colour change can be achieved with pink and blue varieties on neutral soils by the careful use of <b>soil</b> <b>additives.</b> The flowers occur on old wood, and little pruning is needed. It may be pruned after flowering by cutting back flowering stems to a pair of healthy buds. Weak or winter-damaged stems can be pruned in early spring.|$|E
50|$|For {{artificial}} cultivation container {{culture is}} a must, and the growing medium must be naturally acidic. Additionally, all other <b>soil</b> <b>additives</b> must be devoid of any calcium that could buffer the pH to above 5. High quality peat moss or pine duff work well, and pH neutral perlite {{can be added to}} improve porosity. Due to the risk of calcium bicarbonate, tap water is unsuitable. Rainwater or distilled water mixed with 2 oz of vinegar per gallon will assure that a reliably high acidity is maintained in the growing medium. Give bright dappled shade or morning sun. Sink pots in winter or store in a cold frame for insulation. Given these conditions acaule can thrive indefinitely, but will always require much more maintenance than other species/hybrids that can be grown in a wider pH range.|$|E
50|$|For {{crops that}} are not {{exclusively}} for biochar production, the residue-to-product ratio (RPR) and the collection factor (CF) the percent of the residue not used for other things, measure the approximate amount of feedstock that can be obtained for pyrolysis after harvesting the primary product. For instance, Brazil harvests approximately 460 million tons (MT) of sugarcane annually, with an RPR of 0.30, and a CF of 0.70 for the sugarcane tops, which normally are burned in the field. This translates into approximately 100 MT of residue annually, which could be pyrolyzed to create energy and <b>soil</b> <b>additives.</b> Adding in the bagasse (sugarcane waste) (RPR=0.29 CF=1.0), which is otherwise burned (inefficiently) in boilers, raises the total to 230 MT of pyrolysis feedstock. Some plant residue, however, must remain on the soil to avoid increased costs and emissions from nitrogen fertilizers.|$|E

Bonsai enthusiasts {{use it as a}} <b>soil</b> <b>additive,</b> or pot a bonsai tree in 100% diatomaceous earth. In vegetable gardening it is sometimes used as a soil conditioner, because like perlite, vermiculite, and expanded clay, it retains water and nutrients, while draining fast and freely, allowing high oxygen circulation within the growing medium.|$|R

40|$|The main aim of {{this work}} was the {{application}} of the <b>soil</b> <b>additives</b> into soil and the study of their impact on the amount of surface runoff originating from rainwater. Execution of research was carried out on the modified portion of the land at Department of Biometeorology and Hydrology, SUA Slovakia. Land was divided into four experimental plots. Individual treatments consisted of application of perlite, charcoal and water glass into the top layer of the experimental plots. The fourth experimental field was kept as a black fallow (control). To perform the measurements, rainfall simulator was used in six measurement series. We can conclude that the application of perlite is not an adequate treatment for erosion control practices, since its application increased the surface runoff. Increased application dose of additives resulted in the positive effects of the water glass application. Surface runoff for this treatment decreased in average by about 41 % in comparison to control.
