40|$|India {{with its}} long <b>standing</b> <b>capital</b> controls, now eyes a full capital account {{liberalisation}} by 2009 - 10, and further reforms are gradually {{being put in}} place including the opening of portfolio investments as capital inflows, much {{of which has been}} reinforced into a stock exchange boom. It is argued that portfolio investments are volatile and any kind of volatile flows make the developing economies vulnerable to financial crisis. This paper analyses the capital controls in India and the potential risk of a financial crisis and/or a recession hitting the Indian economy under the current scenarios. For this purpose, an analysis of the exchange rate regime, the stock market and banking sector has been undertaken to find out points of risk. The study reveals that the exchange rate in India is quasi-fixed and not market determined as contended by the central bank. It has also been observed that stock markets are likely to crash in the near future plunging the Indian economy into a recession. The banking sector at present does not constitute a major risk {{but at the same time}} is suffering from inherent weaknesses. Finally, based on this it is also concluded that time is not yet ripe for full capital account convertibility.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore how {{managers}} of SMMEs make capital structure decisions for their firms in the South African context. The study is a qualitative and is grounded in interpretivism. The literature unpacked pecking order and trade off theories and together with taxation and profitability they were explored in research questions posed to SMME managers during semi-structured interviews. The findings in this study is that SMME managers find the notion of taking up debt for the sake of the tax incentive to be counter intuitive, debt repayments become an expense that erode the firm's profitability and also exposes the firm to potential bankruptcy. The notion of borrowing without a business purpose, presents a challenge to managers. Business objectives thus present the most compelling determinant of capital structure decision making in this study. Pecking order theory is supported by the findings in this study. This study finds that the Trade off theory has no <b>standing</b> on <b>capital</b> structure decision making in SMMEs and managers explore alternative funding methods such as loan accounts. The implications of this study include a call for academia to undertake descriptive studies to pursue these findings. Development of succinct business objectives will assist SMMEs bridge the gap between themselves and funding institutions.

40|$|Moody’s KMV LossCalc is the Moody's KMV {{model for}} {{predicting}} loss given default (LGD). In April 2009, Moody’s KMV introduced its newest LossCalc model, LossCalc v 3. 0. Building on {{the foundation of}} its predecessors, this model provides users with a systematic approach to estimating recovery on a given issue. In addition, it accounts for how geography, industry, credit cycle stage, debt type, <b>standing</b> in the <b>capital</b> structure, collateral type, and the firm’s credit quality influence recovery. LossCalc v 3. 0 provides a term structure of recovery; the estimated LGD depends on when the default occurs. Specifically, the timevarying drivers of recovery have a smaller impact on predicted recovery the further into the future the default event occurs. Further, the model provides a method for stressing the LGD by reporting estimates of what the recovery on a specific loan {{would have been at}} different stages of the business cycle. While the model is based on post-default prices, we show the relationship between recovery measured using post-default prices, and recovery measured by ultimate recovery (i. e., the present discounted value of the cash flows from the loan if th...|$|R
40|$|Recovery Rates and the Absolute Priority Rule The paper {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between expected recovery rates in bankruptcy and the claim's <b>standing</b> within the <b>capital</b> structure of the debtor. According to the absolute priority rule (APR), the claims in bankruptcy should be always repaid in certain order, i. e. each claim can be satisfied only if all relatively senior claims have been repaid in full. But since the APR is often violated in practice, the actual recoveries may differ significantly from the scenario {{based on the assumption}} of adherence to the APR. The extent of the APR violations depends highly on the creditors' position in the bankruptcy proceedings within each particular legal system. The paper investigates the characteristics of bankruptcy codes that allow APR violations as well as both ex-post and ex-ante effect of these violations. In this context, we also analyse the New Czech Insolvency Act which will enter into force on 1 st January 2008. The paper aims to provide a step towards understanding the problematic relationship between the recovery rates and the creditors' rights protection within particular legal framework.

5000|$|Unlike Phillips' illustrious {{predecessors}} in American art, such as Benjamin West of Philadelphia and John Singleton Copley of Boston, Phillips {{lived and}} worked on the rural frontier—a difference which is key to understanding his career. Though {{he was able to}} successfully market his skills from a young age, it's likely that the relatively sparse demand for painted portraits (a luxury good that reflects and signals a certain social <b>standing)</b> outside the <b>capitals</b> was the main factor necessitating an itinerant career that saw the artist move regularly, family perhaps in tow, between western Massachusetts, Connecticut, and the Hudson River Valley. The artist moved on as he exhausted the demand of the local community for painted [...] "likenesses". This wandering lifestyle is archetypically Romantic, rather contrasting with the bourgeois domesticity of his portraits, which are almost always set within interiors. A letter from the American artist John Vanderlyn to his nephew, John Vanderlyn, Jr., from Kingston, New York, dated September 9, 1825, stated, [...] "Were I to begin life again, I should not hesitate to follow this plan, that is, to paint portraits cheap and slight, for the mass of folks can't judge of the merits of a well finished picture, I am more and more persuaded of this. Indeed, moving about through the country as Phillips did and probably still does, must be an agreeable way of passing ones time. I saw four of his works at Jacobus Hardenburgh's the other day painted a year or two ago, which seemed to satisfy them." ...|$|R
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) A {{significant}} literature gap {{exists in}} our understanding of the motivating mechanisms for creation of foundations by philanthropists, a rapid paradigm shift that is occurring in many countries. This study aims to address the literature gap by discovering Chinese entrepreneurs' heterogeneous responses to the conditions that may lead to creation of their own foundations. Adopting the institutional entrepreneurship theory, which examines agency/change in breaking from an old institution, the researcher tested and operationalized four major factors derived from the institutional entrepreneurship theory [...] i. e. conflict, heterogeneity, institutional logic, and power [...] to account for the behavioral change. Through investigating 209 wealthy Chinese entrepreneurs from the 2003 - 2004 Top 100 Philanthropists List produced by the Hurun Research Institute, utilizing the event history analysis method, the study discovered that among the four factors only heterogeneity resulting from strategic industry intersection and the entrepreneurs' political power are the antecedents of their creation of foundations. Other factors [...] such as conflict, heterogeneity resulted from civil network, and institutional logic [...] were not relevant in this study. These results suggest that Chinese entrepreneurs who benefit from their improved political and social <b>standing</b> and increased <b>capital</b> are also making endeavors to take initiatives to contribute to the social and economic well-beings in the social areas that the entrepreneurs' industry intersect heavily.

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the issue of}} the real beginning of Cairo and defines the proper boundaries of historical Cairo. In fact, ever since civilized man became established in the Nile Valley, there have been important settlements within and close to the present boundaries of the city of Cairo. Memphis which lies 20 km to the south of the centre of Cairo on {{the west bank of the}} Nile was the capital of Egypt during the third to sixth dynasties (2720 BC to 2420 BC). However, the more recent history of Cairo can be traced from the founding of Al- Fustat in AD 641 which lies towards the southern boundary of the existing city on the east bank of the Nile. When Amr Ibn Al- As defeated the Roman in Egypt in the year 641 AD, he regarded the provisional fortress town of Babylon as a more strategic site than the Greco- Roman capital of Alexandria. He, therefore, founded a garrison town north and east of Babylon named Al- Fustat (signifying the tent). This was the real beginning of Cairo the <b>capital</b> <b>standing</b> on the east bank of the Nile and replacing ancient Memphis to the west. Later rulers were to add other administrative centres to Fustat. Under the Abbasids, Tulunids and Fatimids subsequent expansion was always to the north east, with the city finally centering around the area lying between the Citadel and Bab Al- Foutouh. The focus of new quarter was always its mosque. In later centuries, subsequent expansion occured under the Abbassids and Tulunids. The Abbassids, in the year 751 A. D., founded their provincial capital known as Al- Askar. It was built little to the north east of Al-Fustat. As the time went on, Al- Askar grew until it joined Al- Fustat. In AD 870, the Tulunids constructed a new suburb to the north of Al- Askar called Al- Qataie. This new suburb was partly destroyed in AD 905. What was left merged with Al- Fustat...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{programs}} advocated by NGOs worldwide and, more specifically, in South Asia is 'credit' provision along with their other social agendas. NGOs providing such credit have become known as microfinance institutions or MFIs. By advocating and implementing microfinance programs, MFIs aim to assist and enable their members to have an improved quality of life. Theoretically, these successes rely heavily on the conception that MFI members or borrowers can make use of their social capital to overcome {{many of the problems}} associated with asymmetric information in credit markets, such as adverse selection, moral hazard, collateral and contract enforcement, etc. Together these concepts constitute the notion of 'wellbeing' and are made up of human development, physical assets, social capital and increased income. On the other hand, Bourdieu's (Bourdieu 1986 b) definition of social capital as 'economic, cultural and social' forms of capital which can be converted into money or may be institutionalized into a form of a qualification, or as a form of 'social obligation' that can be institutionalized as a form of a 'title of nobility'. Bourdieu put forward the argument that economic capital is the 'bottom line' whereas social and cultural capital is instrumental to improving one's economic <b>standing</b> or economic <b>capital</b> in capitalist societies. The social effect of microfinance can lead to higher social status, and also help in the formation of social capital in society. Thus, microfinance programs around the world have a strong pivotal role in harnessing social capital for its successful programs as well as complementing the formation or further strengthening of social capital in a social or community setting. This paper discusses aspects of non-government organizations (NGOs), given their importance to the microfinance sector. It includes their typology, early development and the theoretical underpinnings of their growth, followed by a review of the more controversial schools of thought around the emergence of NGOs. Then a discussion on social capital provides a theoretical link with NGOs, in this case, to the context of Microfinance Institutions. The paper presents and concludes with a conceptual model that shows how the intervention of microfinance can impact positively on several elements of social capital and improve the socio-economic situation and vice versa...|$|R
