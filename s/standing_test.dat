Methods 65 subjects with UVH and 92 healthy subjects regarded as control group took the postural stability tests in four different stances including(1) standard Romberg test, (2) feet–apart stance test, (3) tandem and (4) unilateral <b>standing</b> <b>tests.</b> In each stance, the postural stability was measured in both eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) conditions. The average time that subjects kept balance before falling in each test conditions was recorded by stopwatch as the timed result. In addition, the sway velocity (SV) of center of foot pressure in the upright stance during standard Romberg test and feet apart stance, regarded as postural stability, was also recorded as SPG. Results(1) The balance–maintaining time of the UVH group in tandem and unilateral standing with EO and EC was decreased(P 0. 05). ConclusionsThe results suggest that the tandem and unilateral stance tests may provide additional information about the upright stance to the SPG measurement in patients with UVH.

40|$|In Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court for {{the first}} time clearly gave greater {{standing}} rights to states than ordinary citizens. The Court, however, failed to explain to what extent or when states are entitled to more lenient standing. This Article concludes that the Court has historically given states preferential status in federal courts when a state files a parens patriae suit based on the state 2 ̆ 7 s quasi-sovereign interest in the health and welfare of its citizens or the natural resources of its inhabitants and territory. A quasi-sovereign interest is inherently less concrete and particularized than the types of injuries that individual citizens need for standing, yet the Court has allowed states standing to protect their general interest in their citizens 2 ̆ 7 health and welfare.

40|$|Background: Ankle {{injuries}} {{account for}} 23, 000 inversion sprains daily. Lateral ankle sprains are predisposed by previous injury and {{a decrease in}} balance. This prospective randomized clinical trial compared the use of high-velocity, low-amplitude (HVLA) manipulation and Muscle Energy Technique mobilization in the treatment of chronic ankle sprains Methods: Forty candidates diagnosed with chronic recurrent ankle sprain were randomized into the trial. The primary outcome measures were the One Leg <b>Standing</b> <b>Test</b> and the Numerical Pain Rating Scale- 101. Results: The One Leg <b>Standing</b> <b>Test</b> and Numerical Pain Rating Scale- 101 had statistically significant and clinically meaningful intra-group changes. The One Leg <b>Standing</b> <b>Test</b> eyes closed showed an increase with High Velocity Low Amplitude manipulation of 10. 24 seconds and with Muscle Energy Technique mobilization of 10. 05 seconds, both t-tests p=. 003 suggestive of a centrally mediated positive neurological effect on the function of the locomotive system. The Numerical Pain Rating Scale- 101 showed significant decrease in High Velocity Low Amplitude manipulation of 37. 1 points and Muscle Energy Technique of 39. 6 points, both t-tests p< 0. 000.

40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} {{the reliability and}} sensitivity to change of the timed <b>standing</b> balance <b>test</b> in children with Down syndrome (DS). Methods: It was a nonblinded, comparison study with {{a convenience sample of}} subjects consisting of children with DS (n = 9) aged 8 – 17 years. The main outcome measure was standing balance which was assessed using timed <b>standing</b> balance <b>test,</b> the time required to maintain in four conditions, eyes open static, eyes closed static, eyes open dynamic, and eyes closed dynamic. Results: Relative reliability was excellent for all four conditions with an Interclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) ranging from 0. 91 to 0. 93. The variation between repeated measurements for each condition was minimal with standard error of measurement (SEM) of 0. 21 – 0. 59 s, suggestive of excellent absolute reliability. The sensitivity to change as measured by smallest real change (SRC) was 1. 27 s for eyes open static, 1. 63 s for eyes closed static, 0. 58 s for eyes open dynamic, and 0. 61 s for eyes closed static.

Results show that both tests correctly indicate side of the lesion but only during first week of illness. Moreover, even during that first week sensitivity of both tests was below 50 %, which means that more then half results from patients fall within normal findings.

40|$|In {{a unique}} decision, the Fifth Circuit in National Solid Waste Management Ass 2 ̆ 7 n v. Pine Belt Regional Solid Waste Management Authority (NSWMA) used the {{prudential}} zone of interests <b>standing</b> <b>test</b> to bar the plaintiffs, who met constitutional standing requirements, from filing a facial, per se challenge under the dormant Commerce Clause. Six Mississippi counties and cities that {{are members of}} the Pine Belt Regional Solid Waste Management Authority (the Authority) had enacted flow control ordinances that required all solid waste collected in their six jurisdictions be sent to the Authority 2 ̆ 7 s facilities, and, thus, prohibited the export of waste to alternative, cheaper in-state or out-of-state sites. Under the dormant Commerce Clause, the Supreme Court had invalidated as facially discriminatory a similar flow control ordinance requiring all local waste be processed by a government-approved processor. This Article will demonstrate that applying the murky zone of interests <b>standing</b> <b>test</b> to the ill-defined dormant Commerce Clause doctrine is counterproductive. In general, courts should require Commerce Clause plaintiffs and most other constitutional litigants to show only that they have constitutional standing without the additional hurdle of meeting the zone of interests <b>standing</b> <b>test.</b> Following the spirit of Clarke v.

40|$|Over {{the last}} several years, data {{breaches}} have become increasingly more common, due {{in no small part}} to the failures of organizations charged with storing and protecting personal data. Consumers whose data has fallen victim to these breaches are more often turning to federal courts in attempts to be made whole from the loss of their information, whether simple credit card information or, as breaches become more sophisticated, social security information, medical and financial records, and more. These consumers are often being turned away from the courthouse, however, due to a failure of many federal courts to find that the plaintiffs have Article III standing to pursue claims. Many of the district courts hearing data breach claims have refused to grant standing because of their interpretation of a recent case addressing constitutional standing, Clapper v.

These courts have concluded that Clapper represents a “tightening” of the traditional <b>standing</b> <b>test</b> under which data breach plaintiffs’ claims that they will suffer harm are too speculative.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Twenty-four-hour {{ambulatory}} {{blood pressure}} and heart rate monitoring (24 -h ABPM) can provide vital information on circadian blood pressure (BP) profiles, which are commonly abnormal in Parkinson's disease with and without autonomic failure (PD + AF and PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Twenty-four-hour ABPM has not been directly compared between these disorders regarding cardiovascular autonomic function. Our aim {{was to determine the}} usefulness of 24 -h ABPM with diary compared to head-up tilting (HUT) in diagnosing orthostatic hypotension (OH) in these patients. METHODS: Seventy-four patients (23 MSA, 18 PD + AF, 33 PD) underwent cardiovascular autonomic screening followed by 24 -h ABPM with diary. Standing tests were included during 24 -h ABPM. The sensitivity and specificity in detecting OH from the 24 -h ABPM <b>standing</b> <b>test</b> were compared with HUT. RESULTS: There was no difference in OH during HUT between MSA and PD + AF (P > 0. 05). There was a higher proportion of abnormal BP circadian rhythms in MSA and PD + AF compared to PD (P 0. 05). Patients were divided into groups with OH (OH+) and without OH (OH-) on HUT. Using the <b>standing</b> <b>test</b> during 24 -h ABPM, a systolic BP fall of > 20 mmHg showed a sensitivity and specificity of 82 % and 100 % (area under the curve 0. 91, 95 % confidence interval 0. 84 - 0. 98) in differentiating OH+ from OH-. CONCLUSIONS: Parkinson's disease with autonomic failure and MSA patients had similar circadian BP patterns suggesting that autonomic dysfunction influences abnormal BP circadian patterns similarly in these disorders. The higher sensitivity and specificity in detecting OH using a systolic BP fall of > 20 mmHg compared to a diastolic BP fall of > 10 mmHg during the <b>standing</b> <b>test</b> supports its usefulness to assess autonomic function in MSA and PD...|$|E
40|$|In Massachusetts v. EPA, 127 S. Ct. 1438 (2007), the Supreme Court {{held that}} carbon dioxide (CO²) and other {{greenhouse}} gases (GHGs) are air pollutants within {{the meaning of}} the Clean Air Act (CAA). Although its decision on the merits is important, the Court 2 ̆ 7 s conclusion that Massachusetts had standing to file suit because states are entitled to more lenient standing criteria may have a greater impact in the long-term on legal doctrine. In Massachusetts, the Supreme Court for the first time clearly gave greater standing rights to states than ordinary citizens. The Court, however, failed to explain to what extent or when states are entitled to more lenient standing. This Article proposes that courts relax the immediacy and redressability prongs of the <b>standing</b> <b>test</b> when states bring parens patriae suits to protect their quasi-sovereign interest in the health, welfare and natural resources of their citizens. This proposed <b>standing</b> <b>test</b> would be similar to the relaxed <b>standing</b> <b>test</b> for procedural rights plaintiffs but is based on the Court 2 ̆ 7 s historic parens patriae decisions. The Court stated that [i]t is of considerable relevance that the party seeking review here is a sovereign State and not [...] . a private individual. The Court contended that the Court in its 1907 decision in Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co. 2 ̆ 2 had recognized that States are not normal litigants for the purposes of invoking federal jurisdiction. 2 ̆ 2 In Tennessee Copper and several other cases, the court had recognized a special standing doctrine of parens patriae standing to allow states to protect certain quasi-sovereign interests including the health, welfare or natural resources of its citizens. The Court concluded that 2 ̆ 2 Massachusetts 2 ̆ 7 well-founded desire to preserve its sovereign territory today 2 ̆ 2 gave it standing to invoke federal jurisdiction Justice Stevens concluded that 2 ̆ 2 the Commonwealth is entitled to special solicitude in our standing analysis. 2 ̆ 2 This Article concludes that the Court has historically given states preferential status in federal courts when a state files a parens patriae suit based on the state 2 ̆ 7 s quasi-sovereign interest in the health and welfare of its citizens or the natural resources of its inhabitants and territory. There are sound reasons to apply lesser standing requirements to enable states to protect their quasi-sovereign interest in the health and welfare of their citizens or the natural resources of its inhabitants and territory. Chief Justice Roberts 2 ̆ 7 dissenting opinion is correct on many details, but fails to understand that the theoretical grounds for parens patriae standing also support a more relaxed <b>standing</b> <b>test</b> for states. A quasi-sovereign interest is inherently less concrete and particularized than the type of injuries that individual citizens need for standing, yet the Court has allowed states standing to protect their general interest in their citizens 2 ̆ 7 health and welfare. Although it is not technically a standing case, Tennessee Copper is based on the fundamental distinction that states have different and greater rights than individual citizens. Thus, the Massachusetts majority correctly used the Court 2 ̆ 7 s parens patriae decisions as the basis for giving states preferential access to federal courts even though none of the parens patriae cases had explicitly applied a lower standing threshold for states. The Tennessee Copper decision and other parens patriae cases justify a similar relaxation of the immediacy and redressability requirements for states filing parens patriae suits.

In this work, we evaluated the association of two approaches used to estimate standing balance and sit-to-stand abilities in community-dwelling older people. The clinical-based test was the Short Physical Performance Battery, while the laboratory-based assessments were realized by means of output measures obtained with the Wii Balance Board. The correlation between clinical scores and laboratory measures showed poor association for the <b>standing</b> balance <b>test</b> (. 05 <r<. 37) and modest association for the sit-to-stand test (-. 31 <r<. 73), respectively. Linear regression analysis was in agreement with these findings, and it revealed a model for standing balance that explained 14 % of the association, and a model of sit-to-stand that explained 69 % of the association. Discriminant function analysis showed significant classification agreement between the two approaches, but with different levels of accuracy. The rate of accuracy for the <b>standing</b> balance <b>test</b> was 63. 3 %, while for the sit-to-stand test the rate of accuracy was 92. 2 %. For both tests, these values were lower after a cross-validation procedure. The values of root mean square of the center of pressure was a significant predictor for different ability levels in the <b>standing</b> balance <b>test,</b> while the vertical component of the ground reaction force and the overshoot were the predictors for sit-to-stand ability levels. These findings seem to support the feasibility of using the Wii Balance Board for the assessment of balance and sit-to-stand abilities in elderly people.

40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} {{prevalence}} {{and severity of}} orthostatic intolerance in survivors of childhood cancer and in healthy controls, and to correlate results of self-reported measures of health status with orthostatic testing in survivors of childhood cancer. Patient and methods: Thirty-nine survivors of childhood cancer and 56 controls were recruited for this study Each cancer survivor completed standardised self-report measures and all participants underwent a <b>standing</b> <b>test</b> (5 min supine, 10 min of motionless standing leaning against a wall, followed by another 2 min supine). The main outcomes of the <b>standing</b> <b>test</b> were orthostatic tachycardia (OT), defined as a heart rate increase of at least 30 beats per minute (bpm) during standing, and neurally mediated hypotension (NMH), defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure of at least 25 mm Hg. Results: OT developed in 22 / 39 (56 %) cancer survivors versus 17 / 56 (30 %) controls (P =. 01). Cancer survivors had a higher baseline and maximum standing heart rate (both P <. 001) and a more rapid onset of significant OT (P =. 005). No significant difference in scores on self-report measures was found between cancer survivors with or without OT. Conclusion: This study provides preliminary evidence of {{a higher rate of}} orthostatic intolerance in childhood cancer survivors. Further study is warranted to better define whether this is a modifiable risk factor for fatigue in this population, and how orthostatic intolerance interacts with other known risk factors for lowered quality of life.

The results have also showed a high correlation between the age and the average acceleration for dynamic one leg balance. Furthermore, an increase of the acceleration vector {{in the course of the}} trials (except in normal gait) was observed. ConclusionsAlthough, the accelerometric data obtained in L 4 and L 5 have often been used arbitrarily for balance evaluation, actually there are differences in the records that made. Therefore, choosing the L 4 not only reduces the kinematics information provided by the accelerometers but also simplifies the process of evaluation and analysis...|$|R
40|$|Impairment of {{the dynamic}} control of the lumbopelvic complex in LBP has gained {{increased}} focus both clinically and experimentally. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine the reliability of inclinometry as a measure of dynamic lumbopelvic control. Lumbopelvic reposition accuracy during pelvic tilts was measured in 39 healthy subjects using an inclinometer attached to the skin at S 2 level. The reposition accuracy was measured in sitting, standing and supported <b>standing.</b> <b>Tests</b> were performed three times with a 20  min recess between tests. Only data from the last two test sequences were used in order to account for learning effects. Intraclass correlation coefficients were low for the sitting (0. 54) and supported standing positions (0. 36). In the standing position, a significant difference between test and retest was observed (P =  0. 003) and further reliability analysis was therefore abandoned. It is concluded that inclinometry is not reliable for measuring the dynamic lumbopelvic control in any of the test positions and prior work utilising inclinometry to evaluate dynamic lumbopelvic control should be interpreted with caution...|$|R
