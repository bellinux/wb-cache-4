5|$|The galactic {{plane of}} the Milky Way passes through Perseus, whose {{brightest}} star is the yellow-white supergiant Alpha Persei (also called Mirfak or Mirphak), which <b>shines</b> <b>at</b> <b>magnitude</b> 1.79. It {{and many of the}} surrounding stars are members of an open cluster known as the Alpha Persei Cluster. The best-known star, however, is Algol (Beta Persei), linked with ominous legends because of its variability, which is noticeable to the naked eye. Rather than being an intrinsically variable star, it is an eclipsing binary. Other notable star systems in Perseus include X Persei, a binary system containing a neutron star, and GK Persei, a nova that peaked at magnitude 0.2 in 1901. The Double Cluster, comprising two open clusters quite near each other in the sky, was known to the ancient Chinese. The constellation gives its name to the Perseus cluster (Abell 426), a massive galaxy cluster located 250 million light-years from Earth. It hosts the radiant of the annual Perseids meteor shower—one of the most prominent meteor showers in the sky.|$|E

25|$|Iota and Psi Andromedae {{make up the}} asterism. <b>Shining</b> <b>at</b> <b>magnitude</b> 4.29, Iota Andromedae is a blue-white main {{sequence}} star of spectral type B8V around 500 light-years distant from Earth.|$|R
50|$|The planet Uranus {{was near}} {{opposition}} (opposition on October 7) during the eclipse, just over 1° from the eclipsed Moon. <b>Shining</b> <b>at</b> <b>magnitude</b> 5.7, Uranus {{should have been}} bright enough to identify in binoculars.

50|$|However, the {{low light}} levels {{at such a}} great {{distance}} from the sun ensure that the moons appear very dim; the brightest, Ariel, would only <b>shine</b> <b>at</b> <b>magnitude</b> -7.4, more than 100 times dimmer than the moon as seen from Earth. Meanwhile, the outer large moon Oberon would only be as bright as magnitude -4.9, {{about the same as}} Venus despite its proximity.|$|R

Located approximately [...] distant, it normally <b>shines</b> <b>at</b> <b>magnitude</b> 6.17, but during eclipses can fall as low as magnitude 7.32. It has been suggested by multiple studies that mass transfer is occurring between the two stars of this system, and the period of eclipses seems to be increasing over time.|$|E

50|$|The Earth {{is visible}} from Mars as a double star; the Moon would be visible {{alongside}} it as a fainter companion. The maximum visible {{distance between the}} Earth and the Moon would be about 25′, at inferior conjunction of the Earth and the Sun (for the terrestrial observer, this is the opposition of Mars and the Sun).

50|$|The bright {{binary system}} in Leo with orange-red and yellow or greenish-yellow {{components}} is visible through a modest telescope under good atmospheric conditions. To the naked eye, the Algieba system <b>shines</b> <b>at</b> mid-second <b>magnitude,</b> but a telescope easily splits the pair. The brighter component has an apparent magnitude of +2.28 and is of spectral class K1-IIIbCN-0.5. The giant K star has a surface temperature of 4,470 K, a luminosity 180 {{times that of}} the Sun, and a diameter 23 {{times that of the}} Sun. The companion star has an apparent magnitude of +3.51 and belongs to the spectral class G7IIICN-I. The giant G star has a temperature of 4,980 K, a luminosity of 50 times that of the Sun, and a diameter 10 times that of the Sun. With angular separation of just over 4", the two stars are at least 170 AU apart (four times the distance between the Sun and Pluto), and have an orbital period of over 500 years.

50|$|Rigel (Beta Orionis) is a {{luminous}} blue supergiant of spectral type B8 Iae, {{in the constellation}} Orion, that is frequently featured in works of science fiction.
