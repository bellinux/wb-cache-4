60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at Andre {{across the}} wide space that now {{separated}} them.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at Joe again. He {{was staring}} as blankly as ever.|$|E
60|$|When <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{down into}} the valley below she saw the white winding ribbon-like trail, and with her eyes she {{followed}} it to where the valley opened wide upon the plains.|$|E
5000|$|The DVD {{features}} exclusive backstage {{footage of}} the concert, including a look into the dancers' dressing rooms and a prank played on Kylie during the show entitled 'Will Kylie Crack'. The prank consist of stage personnel doing random things below the stage where Kylie can see them when <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the back drop during [...] "So Now Goodbye".|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> neither <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at him nor spoke. No ghost or {{stranger}} {{could have}} passed more silently.|$|R
60|$|She {{exhibited}} no {{anger at}} what he said, nor did <b>she</b> <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at him, but only replied, in a low voice, {{that he should not}} talk so, for that it could only be a pain to them both to speak of such things, and that whether she would or no, she must do everything her grandfather bade her, he being indeed a terrible man.|$|R
6000|$|... "I pray God that I {{may never}} {{be called upon to}} make it again," [...] {{answered}} Suzanne, staggering to her feet, the water running from her dripping dress as <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> across the river.|$|E
60|$|Even the stout man clapped, and Rose {{could only}} laugh delightedly as <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at Archie, {{who seemed to}} have let himself loose at last and was {{stamping}} with a dogged energy funny to see.|$|E
60|$|Anne {{stood and}} watched Diana out of sight, mournfully waving {{her hand to}} the latter {{whenever}} <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> back. Then {{she returned to the}} house, not a little consoled for the time being by this romantic parting.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> involuntarily <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> in his face, {{but stopped}} {{before she had}} quite lifted her eyes high enough. 'Why did you do that?' she asked with suave curiosity.|$|R
50|$|Maliella runs in, {{with the}} Camorrists after her. Rafaele is in pursuit, he being {{the leader of}} the band, a handsome, flashy blackguard. When he {{advances}} to seize and kiss her, she draws out a hat pin. Laughing, he throws off his coat, like a duellist, grasps and holds her tightly. She stabs his hand, making it bleed, then throws away the pin. He laughs disdainfully, passionately kisses the wound. There is an extended scene with accepting and rejecting flowers, wearing them, tossing them away. Rafaele heads for the inn - <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at him.|$|R
60|$|Once {{the fair}} invalid {{turned and looked}} back, {{but she was too}} far away for him to discern the {{expression}} of her face. He was not possessed of self-esteem enough <b>to</b> believe <b>she</b> had <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{understand}} you now," [...] he said, at last. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at him. [...] "My {{practice in the}} divorce business out here has almost destroyed my faith in women. If it weren't for my wife and sister--" ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Trevor sighed with sheer {{happiness}} {{in all the}} wonderful, fleeting, elusive loveliness of sky and sea. Then <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> back at Noel's Cove, dim and shadowy in the gloom of the tall headlands, and she saw Paul.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Bo! You've had a tumble," [...] exclaimed Helen, anxiously, {{and she ran}} {{to assist}} Roy. They led her up the porch and to the door. There <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at Carmichael, who was still {{examining}} the spent mustang.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{painting}} by Mola Ram: Abhisarika nayika, [...] "the heroine {{going to meet}} her lover". <b>She</b> <b>turns</b> back <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at a golden anklet, which has just fallen off. There are also snakes below and lightning above.|$|R
50|$|A similar {{split screen}} effect is {{used during the}} first scene of a boy and girl using their powers to stop their 'brother' {{stealing}} a puzzle box; the close ups of the mother holding the boy as his eyes begin <b>to</b> glow and <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at him are achieved as above this time without a black line separating the freeze frames of the boy from the live motion of the mother. The final effect of the children's eyes zooming out of the flames of their burning school house utilized multiple exposures of a model head with glowing eyes which the camera zoomed in on.|$|R
60|$|She {{tossed her}} head. With {{her hands to}} the back of her hair <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> round <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at herself for a moment in one of the mirrors which lined the inside of the bar. Burton grinned at his late employer.|$|R
60|$|At {{the door}} <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look,</b> and there, in {{the centre of}} the room, still stood her husband, tears {{streaming}} from his eyes, down a face radiant with an unearthly smile, and his right hand lifted towards the heavens. And so she left him.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at {{him with}} an amused smile. The lights flashed on the {{diamonds}} around her throat, and the glittering spangles upon her black dress. Truly a wonderfully beautiful woman--a divine figure, and a dress, which scarcely {{a woman who had}} looked at it had not envied.|$|E
60|$|At {{last she}} lifted his arm, and drew {{herself out of}} the chair. Siegmund looked at her from his tranquillity. She put the damp hair from her forehead, breathed deep, almost panting. Then she glanced hauntingly at her flushed face in the mirror. With the same restlessness, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the night. The cool, dark, watery sea called to her. She pushed back the curtain.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, {{the movie}} reveals that an Israeli soldier, Youssef (Maher Bsaibes), {{stationed}} at the border {{is in love with}} Lamia. After Lamia comes to live in Samy’s house, she barely eats or sleeps or talks; this goes on for 20 days. Later, during an argument with her husband, Lamia tells him that she loves someone else, who <b>turns</b> out <b>to</b> be Youssef. Samy’s family gets frustrated with Lamia and takes her to the border so that she can talk to her mother. Lamia is given binoculars, but instead of looking at her mother, <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at Youssef and exchanges smiles with him. Both families fume at this and her binoculars are taken away.|$|R
5000|$|John William Waterhouse painted three episodes {{from the}} poem. In 1888, he painted the Lady setting out for Camelot in her boat; {{this work is}} now in the Tate Gallery. In 1894, Waterhouse painted the Lady at the climactic moment when <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at Lancelot in the window; this work {{is now in the}} City Art Gallery in Leeds. Poulson argues that Waterhouse's impressionistic {{painting}} style in his 1894 rendering of The Lady of Shalott evokes a [...] "sense of vitality and urgency". In 1915, Waterhouse painted [...] "I Am Half-Sick of Shadows," [...] Said the Lady of Shalott, as she sits wistfully before her loom; this work is now in the Art Gallery of Ontario.|$|R
6000|$|... "Go after her!" [...] {{he burst}} out, {{with a sharp}} edge in his voice. [...] "Do you think <b>she</b> would <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at me, or value any word I ever uttered to her again at more than a dirty feather?--Explain! How can a man explain {{at the expense of}} a woman?" ...|$|R
60|$|Her eyes always grew wet {{when she}} thought like that, and <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> {{at herself in the}} glass. His heart had beat inside that coat, and his brain had worked under that hat at levels of thought she would never reach. The {{consciousness}} of her weakness beside him made her feel quite sick. Before she had got the things off her the door opened, and her husband entered the room.|$|E
60|$|The child, without {{altering}} {{her expression}} in the slightest, {{turned her back on}} him, and continued wiping her neck. She dropped the sponge in the water and took the towel from {{off the side of the}} bath. Then <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> again at Siegmund, who stood in his pyjamas before her, his mouth shut hard, but his eyes shrinking and tender. She seemed to be trying to discover something in him.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at him, and {{the calm}} {{scrutiny}} of her level gray eyes somehow disturbed him. [...] "It {{is easy for}} you to talk like that," [...] she said. [...] "You are still young and strong, and if the pendulum of fate swings against you one day, it pays you back the next. You are selfish because you cannot help it. You cannot even realize the hideousness of death! You cannot realize it because it comes to other people, and not to you!" ...|$|E
60|$|The unshaded {{electric}} light shining {{upon the}} table covered with papers dazed Katharine for a moment. After {{the confusion of}} her twilight walk, and her random thoughts, life in this small room appeared extremely concentrated and bright. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> instinctively <b>to</b> <b>look</b> out of the window, which was uncurtained, but Mary immediately recalled her.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed almost}} as if Jeanne was {{conscious}} of the fixity of Marguerite's gaze, for though <b>she</b> did not <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at her, the flush gradually deepened in her cheeks.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Kurt, indeed I do--very dearly," [...] <b>she</b> replied, and <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> up {{into his}} face. It was transfigured. Lenore's heart swelled as a deep and {{profound}} emotion waved over her.|$|R
60|$|As {{she opened}} the door, {{a puff of smoke}} made her catch her breath, then run to throw open the window before <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for the fallen brand. A fire had been kindled in this room a short time before, and, to Abby's dismay, the sudden draught fanned the {{smouldering}} sparks which had crept from a fallen log to the mop-board and thence around the wooden mantel-piece. A suspicious crackling was heard, little tongues of flame darted from the cracks, and the air was full of smoke.|$|E
60|$|When {{she saw her}} danger the Princess became frightened, {{and tried}} to escape through the door by which she had entered; but to her dismay she found it locked. Then <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at the Wizard. The little man had perched himself upon a high stool, and was {{carelessly}} swinging his feet and laughing with glee at Truella's awful peril. He thought that at last he had certainly {{found a way to}} destroy her. The poor Princess again looked into the gulf, which was gradually getting nearer and nearer; and she shuddered at its vast depths.|$|E
60|$|At last <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> behind her. There on {{the left}} stood rows of immense houses, barred and grated like jails or fortresses; palaces where lived the mighty ones of Chicago commerce. Before their doors {{carriages}} stood, with attendants in livery, such as she had read about and had never seen. Up and down the curving ribbon of lavender sand other carriages were driving, with jingle of silver chains and soft roll of wheels. The horses flung foam from their bits; they were magnificent horses (she knew horses {{as well as any}} coachman), and their brass-trimmed harnesses glittered in the sun like burnished gold.|$|E
50|$|Another {{view in the}} Jewish exegesis of Genesis 19:26, is {{that when}} Lot's wife <b>looked</b> back, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>to</b> a pillar of salt upon the sight of God who was {{descending}} down to rain destruction upon Sodom and Gomorrah. One reason that is given in the tradition is that <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> back <b>to</b> <b>look</b> in order <b>to</b> see if her daughters, who were married to men of Sodom, were coming or not.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> {{her head}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at him. He was sitting a little outside the circle--an {{attitude}} typical, perhaps, {{of his position}} there. The change in her tone was slight indeed, but it was sufficient.|$|R
