5|$|During the {{original}} era the Panthers {{did not have}} a logo, instead using stylised lettering on the front of their shirts. The club's current logo was adopted in 2003 and is the fifth to be used since the Panthers were reformed. The first was used between 1980 and 1994 and was the <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Panthers' head in a red circle. The second logo, adopted in 1994, was similar to the first but used a more detailed Panthers' head. The third logo, introduced in 1998, featured a keyhole shaped like the head of a cat with a Panther reaching through it. The fourth logo was adopted following the move to the National Ice Centre and was similar to the logo of German side Augsburger Panther. The stylised lettering used during {{the original}} era was used again on special shirts made to mark the sixtieth anniversary of the club in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Set {{apart from}} the glowing underside, the darker, nonluminescent collar tapers at {{both sides of the}} throat, and has been {{hypothesized}} to serve as a lure by mimicking the <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small fish from below. The appeal of the lure would be multiplied in a school of sharks. If the collar does function in this way, the cookiecutter shark would be the only known case of bioluminescence in which the absence of light attracts prey, while its photophores serve to prevent premature detection by incoming would-be predators. As the shark can only match a limited range of light intensities, its vertical movements likely serve to preserve the effectiveness of its disguise across various times of day and weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|In the Catch 'Em Mode, players must {{reveal a}} <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Pokémon by hitting bumpers. Once it is revealed, players must hit the Pokémon that appears three {{times with the}} ball as it sits in one spot before the time runs out. Egg Mode is a similar concept, though the baby Pokémon roam around the board as opposed to {{standard}} Pokémon, which stand still. As opposed to being timed, players must capture it before it returns from whence it came. Evolution Mode is also similar, requiring players to hit all of the evolution item markers in order to evolve their Pokémon that they have caught or hatched. These include several traditional means of evolution in the Pokémon series, such as stones and experience points. Lastly, Travel Mode allows players to leave the current location on their pinball board, allowing them to capture more kinds of Pokémon {{not found in the}} current area. Ruby & Sapphire featured additional bonus modes that often diverge from the standard gameplay. These modes sometimes feature rare Pokémon such as Groudon, Kyogre, and Rayquaza, and take place on separate fields. Outside of the gameplay, players may also view the Pokémon they have caught, listen to sound effects and music from the game, and view their high scores for each board.|$|E

25|$|In some apparitions {{an image}} is {{reported}} absent any verbal interaction. An {{example is the}} reported apparitions at Our Lady of Assiut in which many people reported a bright image atop a building. Photographs at times suggest the <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> statue of the Virgin Mary but the images are subject to varying interpretations, and critics suggest that they may just be due to various visual effects. However, such image-like appearances are hardly ever reported for visions of Jesus and Mary. In most cases these involve some form of reported communication.|$|E
25|$|In 1929, Hartness and Russell W. Porter {{patented}} {{an optical}} comparator, {{a device that}} applies the principles of optics to the inspection of manufactured parts by projecting the magnified <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> part onto a screen where its dimensions and geometry of the part are measured against prescribed limits. This contribution stemmed from Hartness' work as the Chairman of the U.S. National Screw-Thread Commission and from his familiarity with optics in astronomy and telescope-building. The Hartness Screw-Thread Comparator was for many years a profitable product for J The optical comparator remains a standard means inspection of many kinds of parts.|$|E
25|$|At dawn on the 17th, Forsyth sensed {{trouble and}} spotted the <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{feathered}} {{head against the}} skyline. He fired his weapon, instantly killing the Indian warrior. Simultaneously, other Indians, who, having moved nearer to where the scouts' horses were tied up, attempted to stampede them, but the scouts immediately responded {{to the sound of}} Forsyth's gunshot and only the pack mules were lost. Roman Nose, war leader of the Cheyenne, had planned a dawn raid to overrun the camp of 50 U.S. scouts, but the element of surprise was lost when a few eager warriors rushed the camp before the order to attack was given.|$|E

25|$|The picture below {{shows the}} Shrimp device, detonated on March 1, 1954 at Bikini, as the Castle Bravo test. Its 15-megaton {{explosion}} {{was the largest}} ever by the United States. The <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man is shown for scale. The device is supported from below, at the ends. The pipes going into the shot cab ceiling, which appear to be supports, are actually diagnostic light pipes. The eight pipes at the right end (1) sent information about the detonation of the primary. Two in the middle (2) marked the time when x-radiation from the primary reached the radiation channel around the secondary. The last two pipes (3) noted the time radiation reached {{the far end of}} the radiation channel, the difference between (2) and (3) being the radiation transit time for the channel.|$|E
25|$|Saul Bass {{designed}} emblematic movie posters {{that transformed}} the visuals of film advertising. Before Bass’s seminal poster for The Man with the Golden Arm (1955), movie posters {{were dominated by}} depictions of key scenes or characters from the film, often both juxtaposed with each other. Bass’s posters, however, typically developed simplified, symbolic designs that visually communicated key essential elements of the film. For example, his poster for The Man with the Golden Arm, with a jagged arm and off-kilter typography, starkly communicates the protagonist's struggle with heroin addiction. Bass's iconic Vertigo (1958) poster, with its stylized figures sucked down into the nucleus of a spiral vortex, captures the anxiety and disorientation central to the film. His poster for Anatomy of a Murder (1959), featuring the <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> corpse jarringly dissected into seven pieces, makes both a pun on the film’s title and captures the moral ambiguities within which this court room drama is immersed.|$|E
25|$|The footage {{was shot}} by Eric Saarinen, who was on stage taking {{pictures}} of the crowd, and Baird Bryant, who climbed atop a bus. Saarinen was unaware of having caught the killing on film. This was discovered {{more than a week}} later when raw footage was screened in the New York offices of the Maysles Brothers. In the film sequence, lasting about two seconds, a two-meter (six foot) opening in the crowd appears, leaving Bredehoft in the center. Hunter enters the opening from the left. His hand rises toward the stage, and the <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> revolver is clearly seen against Bredehoft's light-colored dress. Passaro is seen entering from the right and delivering two stabs with his knife as he parries Hunter's revolver and pushes him off-screen; the opening then closes around Bredehoft. Passaro was reported to have stabbed Hunter five times in the upper back, although only two stabs are visible in the footage. Witnesses also reported Hunter was stomped on by several Hells Angels while he was on the ground. The gun was recovered and turned over to police. Hunter's autopsy confirmed he was high on methamphetamine when he died. Passaro was arrested and tried for murder in the summer of 1971, but was acquitted after a jury viewed concert footage showing Hunter brandishing the revolver and concluded that Passaro had acted in self-defense.|$|E

500|$|In the past, the convex {{section of}} the emblem had a blue colour (another symbol of Turin) and, furthermore, its shape was concave. The old French shield and the mural crown, also in the lower {{section of the}} emblem, had a {{considerably}} greater size {{with respect to the}} present. The two [...] "Golden Stars for Sport Excellence" [...] were located above the convex and concave section of Juventus' emblem. During the 1980s, the club emblem was the <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> zebra, to both sides of the equide's head, the two golden stars and, above this badge, forming an arc, the club's name.|$|E
500|$|Juventus's {{official}} emblem {{has undergone}} different and small modifications since the 1920s. The previous {{modification of the}} Juventus badge took place in 2004, when the emblem of the team changed to a black-and-white oval shield of a type used by Italian ecclesiastics. It is divided in five vertical stripes: two white stripes and three black stripes, inside which are the following elements, while in its upper section {{the name of the}} society superimposed on a white convex section, over golden curvature (gold for honour). The white <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> charging bull is in the lower section of the oval shield, superimposed on a black old French shield and the charging bull is a symbol of the comune of Turin. There is also a black <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mural crown above the black spherical triangle's base. This is a reminiscence to Augusta Tourinorum, the old city of the Roman era which the present capital of Piedmont region is its cultural heiress. In January 2017, president Andrea Agnelli announced the most recent change to the Juventus badge, revealing a video showing the introduction of the new badge. The badge shows the word Juventus on top, with two capital Js shown together in different fonts with a small opening between them to almost make a bigger J. Agnelli said that the badge reflects [...] "the Juventus way of living". Juventus was the first team in association football history to adopt a star who added one above their badge in 1958 to represent their tenth Italian Football Championship and Serie A title, at the time and has since become popularized with other clubs as well.|$|E

500|$|The name [...] "cookiecutter shark" [...] {{refers to}} its feeding habit of gouging round plugs, as if cut {{out with a}} cookie cutter, out of larger animals. Marks made by cookiecutter sharks have been found {{on a wide variety}} of marine mammals and fishes, as well as on submarines, undersea cables, and even human bodies. It also consumes whole smaller prey such as squid. Cookiecutter sharks have adaptations for {{hovering}} in the water column and likely rely on stealth and subterfuge to capture more active prey. Its dark collar seems to mimic the <b>silhouette</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small fish, while the rest of its body blends into the downwelling light via its ventral photophores. When a would-be predator approaches the lure, the shark attaches itself using its suctorial lips and specialized pharynx and neatly excises a chunk of flesh using its bandsaw-like set of lower teeth. This species has been known to travel in schools.|$|E
