5|$|Glucocorticoids {{are under}} the {{regulatory}} influence of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Glucocorticoid synthesis is <b>stimulated</b> <b>by</b> adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), a hormone released into the bloodstream by the anterior pituitary. In turn, production of ACTH is <b>stimulated</b> <b>by</b> the presence of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which is released by neurons of the hypothalamus. ACTH acts on the adrenal cells first by increasing the levels of StAR within the cells, and then of all steroidogenic P450 enzymes. The HPA axis {{is an example of}} a negative feedback system, in which cortisol itself acts as a direct inhibitor of both CRH and ACTH synthesis. The HPA axis also interacts with the immune system through increased secretion of ACTH at the presence of certain molecules of the inflammatory response.|$|E
5|$|Catecholamine {{release is}} <b>stimulated</b> <b>by</b> the {{activation}} of the sympathetic nervous system. Splanchnic nerves of the sympathetic nervous system innervate the medulla of the adrenal gland. When activated, it evokes the release of catecholamines from the storage granules by stimulating the opening of calcium channels in the cell membrane.|$|E
5|$|Hydrochloric acid is {{used for}} {{a large number of}} {{small-scale}} applications, such as leather processing, purification of common salt, household cleaning, and building construction. Oil production may be <b>stimulated</b> <b>by</b> injecting hydrochloric acid into the rock formation of an oil well, dissolving a portion of the rock, and creating a large-pore structure. Oil well acidizing is a common process in the North Sea oil production industry.|$|E

Fifty young adult subjects collected unstimulated saliva by spitting method, and then collected <b>stimulated</b> saliva <b>by</b> chewing paraffin wax, and a few drops of citric acid are usually placed on the subject’s tongue. The mean of saliva flow rate that unstimulated: 0. 50 cc/minute; <b>stimulated</b> saliva <b>by</b> chewing paraffin wax: 1. 57 cc/minute, and drops of citric acid stimulation showed that saliva flow rate: 2. 98 cc/minute; and pH saliva that unstimulated 6. 39; <b>stimulated</b> saliva <b>by</b> chewing paraffin wax 7. 2; and <b>stimulated</b> saliva <b>by</b> citric acid: 7. 55.

5|$|Killed by bushfire, Grevillea juniperina regenerates {{afterwards}} by {{seeds that}} germinate after lying dormant in the soil, <b>stimulated</b> <b>by</b> exposure to heat and smoke. Plants over 1m (3ft) high produce more seed. Intervals of 10 to 15 years between fires {{are thought to}} be most beneficial for the species' survival, as this allows seed numbers to build up in the soil over time. Grevillea juniperina can also colonise disturbed areas, though overgrowth of Bursaria spinosa can negatively impact its spread.|$|E

5|$|Marcello Malpighi, {{the father}} of microscopical anatomy, {{discovered}} that plants had tubules similar to those he saw in insects like the silk worm. He observed that when a ring-like portion of bark was removed on a trunk a swelling occurred in the tissues above the ring, and he unmistakably interpreted this as growth <b>stimulated</b> <b>by</b> food {{coming down from the}} leaves, and being captured above the ring.|$|E
5|$|Muscle {{cells have}} another {{specialized}} function of smooth ER. The ER membrane pumps calcium ions from the cytosol into the cisternal space. When a muscle cell becomes <b>stimulated</b> <b>by</b> a nerve impulse, calcium goes {{back across the}} ER membrane into the cytosol and generates the contraction of the muscle cell.|$|E
5|$|Pyrosomes are colonial tunicates {{and each}} zooid has {{a pair of}} {{luminescent}} organs {{on either side of}} the inlet siphon. When <b>stimulated</b> <b>by</b> light, these turn on and off, causing rhythmic flashing. No neural pathway runs between the zooids, but each responds to the light produced by other individuals, and even to light from other nearby colonies. Communication by light emission between the zooids enables coordination of colony effort, for example in swimming where each zooid provides part of the propulsive force.|$|E

5|$|The {{core of a}} {{follicle}} {{is surrounded}} by a single layer of follicular cells. When <b>stimulated</b> <b>by</b> thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), these secrete the thyroid hormones T3 and T4.

5|$|The lungs are {{supplied}} by nerves of the autonomic nervous system. Input from the {{parasympathetic nervous system}} occurs via the vagus nerve. When <b>stimulated</b> <b>by</b> acetylcholine, this causes constriction of the smooth muscle lining the bronchus and bronchioles, and increases the secretions from glands. The lungs also have a sympathetic tone from norepinephrine acting on the beta 2 receptors in the respiratory tract, which causes bronchodilation.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of thyroxine and triiodothyronine is primarily regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), {{released by the}} anterior pituitary gland. TSH release in turn is <b>stimulated</b> <b>by</b> thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), released in a pulsatile manner from the hypothalamus. The thyroid hormones provide negative feedback to the thyrotropes TSH and TRH: when the thyroid hormones are high, TSH production is suppressed. This negative feedback also occurs when levels of TSH are high, causing TRH production to be suppressed.|$|E

5|$|Chemical {{pesticides}} {{were first}} used around 2500 BC, when the Sumerians used sulphur compounds as insecticides. Modern pest control was <b>stimulated</b> <b>by</b> the {{spread across the}} United States of the Colorado potato beetle. After much discussion, arsenical compounds were used to control the beetle and the predicted poisoning of the human population did not occur. This {{led the way to}} a widespread acceptance of insecticides across the continent. With the industrialisation and mechanization of agriculture in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the introduction of the insecticides pyrethrum and derris, chemical pest control became widespread. In the 20th century, the discovery of several synthetic insecticides, such as DDT, and herbicides boosted this development.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 19th century, the Surrey villages of Wimbledon and Sutton {{experienced}} rapid residential growth, <b>stimulated</b> <b>by</b> the railways running through their areas, with landowners in both areas profiting from the development of new suburban housing on their previously rural estates. Less accessible to the railways, the parishes of Merton and Morden, which lay between Wimbledon and Sutton, remained largely rural and, starting in the 1880s, a series of railway schemes were proposed to bring a new line through the area and increase the value of the land.|$|E
5|$|Of note, the atrophic {{effects of}} {{glucocorticoids}} {{are not always}} a disadvantage. The treatment of hyperproliferative diseases like psoriasis makes use of this property. SEGRAMs would likely be less effective in such conditions. Recent advances {{have shown that the}} former striving towards a total separation of GR transrepression and transactivation by using SEGRAMs deserves to be nuanced as the anti-inflammatory genes <b>stimulated</b> <b>by</b> GR transactivation, such as GILZ and DUSP1, do seem to play an important role. Nevertheless, the more selective nature of these SEGRAMs would still reduce the number of GR-mediated side effects, and deserves further clinical testing.|$|E

40|$|Using {{electron}} microscopy and morphometric methods to assess secretion, we previously found that two times tidal volume ventilation of isolated perfused rat lung <b>stimulates</b> secretion <b>by</b> bronchiolar Clara cells; {{this effect is}} not prevented by β-adrenergic blockade (J. Clin. Invest. 1981. 67 : 345 - 351.). In this study we used the isolated perfused rat lung and the anesthetized mechanically ventilated rat, to further study the mechanism by which large tidal volumes <b>stimulate</b> secretion <b>by</b> Clara cells. With the perfused lung we found (a) α-adrenergic inhibition did not block the secretory effect of ventilation at two times normal tidal volume; (b) indomethacin completely blocked the secretory action of two times tidal volume ventilation; (c) medium previously used to perfuse lungs ventilated at two times tidal volume, but not medium previously used to ventilate lungs at normal tidal volume, <b>stimulated</b> secretion <b>by</b> Clara cells when used to perfuse fresh lungs ventilated at tidal volume; (d) addition of prostacyclin to the fresh perfusate increased secretion by Clara cells of lungs ventilated at normal tidal volume. In anesthetized mechanically ventilated rats, sighs <b>stimulated</b> secretion <b>by</b> Clara cells; this increased secretion was inhibited by indomethacin but not by cholinergic blockade (bilateral vagotomy). These studies indicate that increased volume ventilation <b>stimulates</b> secretion <b>by</b> Clara cells in vivo and in vitro; they provide evidence that chemical nonadrenergic, noncholinergic mechanisms {{are involved in this}} secretion, and that prostaglandins may be the chemical messenger coupling the mechanico-secretory events...|$|R
