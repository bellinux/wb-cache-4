A comparison of the fan noise and the aerodynamic characteristics of the tubular casing with those of <b>scroll</b> <b>casing</b> was made. As a result it was concluded that the aerodynamic characteristics of the fan with <b>scroll</b> <b>casing</b> were superior to those with tubular casing. The measured values of overall sound pressure level for both fans roughly same. When the ratio of inlet area to the outlet area of the impeller becomes nearly unity, the fan characteristics improve.

40|$|The {{effects of}} three parameters; the {{location}} of the partition of impeller, the bare ratio and the outlet angle of <b>scroll</b> <b>casing</b> on the turbulent noise and aerodynamic characteristics, were experimentally investigated in the dual-cascades centrifugal fans. In this report, we proposed a new method to estimate the wake width which is an important parameter to calculate the turbulent noise. It was shown that the fan noise became lower when the bare ratio was from 9 % to 25 % and the outlet angle of <b>scroll</b> <b>casing</b> was about 20 °. When the inlet/outlet area ratio of upper cascade was equal to that of the lower cascade and both of these are equal to about unity, the fan noise became lower.

Numerous Jewish synagogues were vandalised and desecrated. According to one account, Torah <b>scrolls</b> in <b>casings</b> of silver and gold were looted from the synagogues and manuscripts of great antiquity were pilfered from the library of Rabbi Judah Bibas. The library, founded in 1852, was partly burned and destroyed. In one instance, a rabbi who had saved a Torah scroll from a blazing synagogue later died from his burns.|$|R

The <b>casing</b> was also slightly slimmer. Pricing was reduced and the lineup was simplified, as the 20GB model was sold for US$299 and the 40GB model for US$399. Notably, Apple began reducing pack-in accessories {{starting with the}} fourth generation. While a dock, carrying case, and wired remote were previously included with higher-end iPods, the higher-level 40GB iPod only came with a dock, earphones and an interchangeable proprietary cable capable of USB and FireWire interface. In addition to using the iPod Mini's Click Wheel, the fourth-generation iPod used the more energy-efficient components of the Mini, allowing the fourth-generation iPod to over 12 hours of battery life while using the same battery as its predecessor.|$|R

40|$|The {{fan noise}} {{consists}} of the turbulent noise and the discrete frequency noise. On the multi-blades centrifugal fan, the spectral form is relatively smooth {{over a wide range}} of frequency without distinct discrete peak. Therefore the noise observed away from the fan is the turbulent noise. In this report, we proposed a new method to calculate the width of wake which is an important parameter to controll the turbulent noise. The effects of four parameters : the location of partition, the bare ratio, the outlet angle of <b>scroll</b> <b>casing</b> and the chord length of impeller on the turbulent noise were investigated. On the fan noise, it was shown that the fan noise become lower when the bare ratio was around between 9 % to 25 % and the outlet angle of <b>scroll</b> <b>casing</b> was around 0 ° to 20 °, then the noise of the dual-cascade centrifugal fan were superior to that of the single-cascade centrifugal fan.

40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{influence}} of the cutoff of the <b>scroll</b> <b>casing</b> on the discrete frequency noise,the dependence of the diameter of a cylinder on the discrete frequency noise generated from interaction with the wake of a centrifugal impeller is discussed. The discrete frequency noise level decreases when the diameter of the cylinder becomes large. The noise is generated by the pressure gradient at the stagnation point on the cylinder surface formed by the jet-wake flow of the impeller. The domain where the stagnation point vibrates extends when the diameter of the cylinder becomes large; the pressure fluctuation has become small according to the diameter. It is shown that the interaction noise generated from the centrifugal fan can be reduced depending on the design of the cutoff shape...|$|E
40|$|The {{impeller}} of this fan is {{consisted of}} many thin plate radial blades. This fan {{could make the}} separation of blade surface flow controlled at low flow and the wake behind the blade diffused in short distance. Therefore {{it is expected that}} the fan noise become lower at whole flow rate than ordinary centrifugal fans. Experimental investigations of the fluid dynamic characteristics of malti-blade radial fans were conducted to the effects of three parameters : (1) the inner diameter (D_i) of impeller, (2) the number of blades (B), (3) the volute angle (α) of <b>scroll</b> <b>casing.</b> It was experimentally shown that the condition of D_i= 58 mm, B= 120, α= 4. 5 gave the highest fan efficiency and pressure coefficient over the most flow rate region in those experiments...|$|E

The following results are obtained. The inlet angle of the impeller, which is estimated by the radial inflow condition, gives the extremely low angle for the inflow condition. The cause is that the leakage flow from the clearance between the front shroud and the bell mouth is very large and has the tangential component of velocity. And we proposed the new charts of the performance on the fan noise. They clearly indicate {{the effect of the}} inlet and outlet angles of the impeller to the performance of the fan noise.

It was shown that in the aerodynamic characteristics, the optimal volute angle existed between 4. 8 and 7. 2 degrees, and in the characteristics of noise, {{that existed in the}} near 7. 2 degrees. The wake width of grooved blade fan became narrower than that of the ordinary blade fan. Therefore, the grooved blade fan was superior in noise characteristics to the ordinary blade fan.

It is shown that there is little diference among three area ratios and between the porus material blade and resinous blade. The rotational speed of the fan in the apparatus with rectangular heat exchanger must be increased of about 7 % than that with circular heat exchanger to obtain the regulation flow rate (Q= 18 m^ 3 /min). Therefore the noise radiated from the former is higher than the latter.

In the second report, in order to predict the interaction noise generated from a centrifugal fan, the prediction theory of the noise level based on the wake characteristics of the centrifugal impeller is proposed. In the prediction theory, the drag {{in the wake of the}} centrifugal impeller is applied for the periodic fluctuation phenomenon of the momentum on the solid surface of the cylinder.

40|$|The nonuniformity {{flow in the}} meridional {{section of}} a multi-blade sirocco fan has been {{represented}} as two domains.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of aerodynamics and noise for a centrifugal fan with inducer were investigated {{by comparison with}} the fan without inducer. The noise generated by these two kinds of fan consists of the discrete frequency noise and the turbulent noise. The discrete frequency noise can be controlled by some method. Therefore, the noise radiated from the centrifugal fan without <b>scroll</b> <b>casing</b> is mostly the turbulent noise. The noise level radiated from the fan with inducer {{is similar to that}} of without inducer. In relation to the aerodynamic characteristics, such as the pressure and the fan efficiency, the former is higher than the latter.
