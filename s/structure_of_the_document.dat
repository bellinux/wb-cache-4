2500|$|Markup is used {{to label}} parts of the {{document}} rather than to provide specific instructions {{as to how they}} should be processed. Well-known examples include LaTeX, HTML, and XML. The objective is to decouple the inherent <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>document</b> from any particular treatment or rendition of it. Such markup is often described as [...] "semantic". An example of descriptive markup would be HTML's <cite> tag, which {{is used to}} label a citation. Descriptive markup—sometimes called logical markup or conceptual markup—encourages authors to write in a way that describes the material conceptually, rather than visually.|$|E

Although XML documents can be accompanied by a DTD that defines <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>documents,</b> <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> a DTD is not mandatory. The difficulty in deriving the DTD for XML <b>documents</b> lies in <b>the</b> fact that DTDs are of different syntax as XML and that prior knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>documents</b> is required. In this paper, we introduce DTD-Miner, an automatic structure mining tool for XML documents. Using a Web-based interface, the user will be able to submit a set <b>of</b> similarly <b>structured</b> XML <b>documents</b> and <b>the</b> system will automatically suggest a DTD. The user is also able to further refine the DTD generated to reduce the complexity by relaxing some the rules used in the system...|$|R
