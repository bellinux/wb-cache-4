5|$|French naturalist Charles Alexandre Lesueur {{originally}} {{described the}} bluntnose stingray from specimens collected in Little Egg Harbor off the U.S. State of New Jersey. He published his account in an 1817 {{volume of the}} Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, and named the new species Raja say in honor of Thomas <b>Say,</b> <b>one</b> of the founding members of the Academy. The species {{was moved to the}} genus Dasyatis by subsequent authors. In 1841, German biologists Johannes Peter Müller and Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle erroneously gave the specific epithet as sayi in their Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen, which thereafter became the typical spelling used in literature. Recently, there has been a push to use the correct original spelling again, though it has also been proposed that the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) officially emend the spelling to sayi, for consistency with previous usage.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Bart {{plans to}} reveal what he witnessed, but Seymour and Edna {{fear that they}} would be fired if anyone found out and they swear him to secrecy. They hire him as their gofer so they can {{secretly}} exchange messages. Bart agrees for a while because the reward for his cooperation is that Milhouse will inherit Bart's poor school record. Eventually, Bart grows frustrated about his home, school and social life continually being interrupted to help them advance their relationship, putting him in embarrassing situations. One afternoon at school, after he is embarrassed in front of his classmates by having to <b>say</b> <b>one</b> of Seymour's messages to Edna out loud, Bart bitterly gathers the entire school in front of a janitor's closet and he opens the door to reveal that Seymour and Edna are making out.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a dispute}} {{regarding}} how one measures direction for this purpose. Some <b>say</b> <b>one</b> should face the direction {{which would be}} the shortest distance to Jerusalem, i.e. the arc of a great circle, as defined in elliptic geometry. Thus in New York one would face north-northeast. Others <b>say</b> <b>one</b> should face the direction along a rhumb line path to Jerusalem, which would not require an alteration of compass direction. This would be represented by a straight line on a Mercator projection, which would be east-southeast from New York. In practice, many individuals in the Western Hemisphere simply face due east, regardless of location. In the presence of an ark that does not face Jerusalem, one should pray toward the ark instead.|$|E

AAA-Bank, and its investors, will incur a $9.5million loss minus recovery unless the bank has somehow offset the position before the default.|$|E
25|$|In fact, {{as their}} {{synthesis}} {{is controlled by}} a template-directed process in most in vivo systems, all biopolymers of a type (<b>say</b> <b>one</b> specific protein) are all alike: they all contain the similar sequences and numbers of monomers and thus {{all have the same}} mass. This phenomenon is called monodispersity in contrast to the polydispersity encountered in synthetic polymers. As a result, biopolymers have a polydispersity index of 1.|$|E

25|$|In {{recent years}} many {{improvements}} {{have been made}} in printing machines and many additions made to their already wonderful capacities. Chief amongst these are those embodied in the Intermittent and the Duplex machines. In the former any or all of the rollers may be moved out of contact with the cylinder at will, and at certain intervals. Such machines are used in the printing of shawls and sarries for the Indian market. Such goods require a wide border right across their width at varying distances sometimes every three yards, sometimes every nine yards and it is to effect this, with rollers of ordinary dimensions, that intermittent machines are used. The body of the sarrie will be printed, say for six yards with eight rollers; these then drop away from the cloth and others, which have up to then been out of action, immediately fall into contact and print a border or crossbar, <b>say</b> <b>one</b> yard wide, across the piece; they then recede from the cloth and the first eight again return and print another six yards, and so on continually.|$|E

500|$|The Nyaya school {{criticized the}} Jain {{doctrine}} of anekantavada, states Karl Potter, as [...] "wanting to <b>say</b> <b>one</b> thing at one time, {{the other at}} another", thereby ignoring the principle of non-contradiction. The Naiyayikas states that {{it makes no sense}} to simultaneously say, [...] "jiva and ajiva are not related" [...] and [...] "jiva and ajiva are related". Jains state that jiva attaches itself to karmic particles (ajiva) which means there is a relation between ajiva and jiva. The Jain theory of ascetic salvation teaches cleansing of karmic particles and destroying the bound ajiva to the jiva, yet, Jain scholars also deny that ajiva and jiva are related or at least interdependent, according to the Nyaya scholars. The Jain theory of anekantavada makes its theory of karma, asceticism and salvation incoherent, according to Nyaya Hindu texts.|$|E

Robyn does not appear in the video. Larry Fitzmaurice of Pitchfork said that the video is [...] "complete with awkward/sexy dancing and footage of bustling city life". Erika Brooks Adickman of Idolator wrote a mixed review of the clip, stating, [...] "We’re guessing Robyn didn’t want the “hassle” of appearing, so instead we’re treated to—seemingly—random grainy footage of the streets of Japan and gyrating women as the words of the chorus appear karaoke-style on the screen. We can <b>say</b> <b>one</b> good thing about the flick, if you were confused about the song’s lyrics, they’re fairly easy to read." ...|$|E
500|$|Edward Teller {{was opposed}} to the hearing, feeling it was {{improper}} to subject Oppenheimer to a security trial, but was torn by longstanding grievances against him. He was called by Robb to testify against Oppenheimer, and shortly before he appeared Robb showed Teller a dossier of items unfavorable to Oppenheimer. Teller testified that he considered Oppenheimer loyal, but that [...] "in {{a great number of}} cases, I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer act – I understand that Dr. Oppenheimer acted – in a way which for me was exceedingly hard to understand. I thoroughly disagreed with him in numerous issues and his actions frankly appeared to me confused and complicated. To this extent I feel that I {{would like to see the}} vital interests of this country in hands which I understand better, and therefore trust more." [...] Asked whether Oppenheimer should be granted a security clearance, Teller said that [...] "if it is a question of wisdom or judgement, as demonstrated by actions since 1945, then I would <b>say</b> <b>one</b> would be wiser not to grant clearance." [...] This led to outrage by many in the scientific community and Teller's ostracism and virtual expulsion from academic science.|$|E
500|$|Bart {{goes on a}} class {{field trip}} to a box factory. He gets bored with the tour and escapes from the class {{to go to the}} Channel 6 TV studio nearby, where he {{encounters}} Krusty the Clown. Krusty is angry that his assistant has failed to get him a Danish, as Bart had eaten it, and fires his assistant on the spot. Bart steals a Danish from Kent Brockman and gives it to Krusty, who is grateful and asks him to become his new assistant. Bart soon gets disillusioned with being Krusty's assistant because the cast members do not treat him well and he does not receive any credit for his work. However, before Bart decides to quit, Krusty offers to let him <b>say</b> <b>one</b> line in a sketch when Sideshow Mel is unavailable thanks to Bart giving him a sandwich with cheese which triggers his lactose intolerance. Bart messes up his line and stumbles, accidentally destroying all of the props on the stage. With the crowd and cameras focused on him, he says [...] "I didn't do it", which causes the audience to erupt with laughter. Seeing Bart's popularity, Krusty uses him and his [...] "I didn't do it" [...] catchphrase in later sketches, and eventually creates a franchise out of it.|$|E

500|$|At Peking Airport, contingents of the Chinese {{military}} {{await the}} arrival of the American presidential aircraft [...] "Spirit of '76", carrying Nixon and his party. The military chorus sings the Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention. After the aircraft touches down, Nixon emerges with Pat Nixon and Henry Kissinger. The president exchanges stilted greetings with the Chinese premier, Chou En-lai, who heads the welcoming party. Nixon speaks of the historical significance of the visit, and of his hopes and fears for the encounter ("News has a kind of mystery"). The scene changes to Chairman Mao's study, where the Chairman awaits {{the arrival of}} the presidential party. Nixon and Kissinger enter with Chou, and Mao and the president converse in banalities as photographers record the scene. In the discussion that follows, the westerners are confused by Mao's gnomic and frequently impenetrable comments, which are amplified by his secretaries and often by Chou. The scene changes again, to the evening's banquet in the Great Hall of the People. Chou toasts the American visitors ("We have begun to celebrate the different ways") and Nixon responds ("I have attended many feasts"), after which the toasts continue as the atmosphere becomes increasingly convivial. Nixon, a politician who rose to prominence on anti-communism, announces: [...] "Everyone, listen; just let me <b>say</b> <b>one</b> thing. I opposed China, I was wrong".|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "Marge's mother Jackie is particularly nightmarish in her first real appearance. The final sequence on the rooftop with Lisa and Bart is lovely, and Homer's comment to Marge is a magical wrap-up to a good episode." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said the episode [...] "maintained a nicely irreverent tone most of the time— irreverent {{enough to make it}} amusing, at least," [...] and added: [...] "The interaction of the Simpson and Bouvier families at dinner was terrific, and Bart’s experiences on skid row made their point while they still managed to be pointed and clever. 'Bart vs. Thanksgiving' was another winner." [...] Bryce Wilson of Cinema Blend said [...] "Bart vs. Thanksgiving" [...] and [...] "Lisa's Substitute", another season two episode, were the first episodes that [...] "asked [...] to truly care about the characters, and they work beautifully." [...] Both Dawn Taylor of The DVD Journal and Jacobson thought the most memorable line of the episode was Jackie's line to Marge: [...] "I have laryngitis and it hurts to talk, so I'll just <b>say</b> <b>one</b> thing— you never do anything right." [...] A reviewer for DVD.net, on the other hand, thought the best line was Homer's [...] "Oh Lord, be honest– are we the most pathetic family in the universe, or what?".|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the February plenum of 1957, which was seen as {{directly}} rebuffing many post-Stalin Soviet views, the Soviet leadership invited Hoxha to visit Moscow in April that year allegedly for consultations. Instead, Khrushchev called on Hoxha to rehabilitate and reinstate party members who had been sacked for their support of Yugoslavia and the theses of the 20th Party Congress; Hoxha refused. In response to this Khrushchev accused Hoxha of sectarianism and of being [...] "hell-bent on pursuing Stalinist policies." [...] Hoxha later recalled the meeting as follows: Khrushchev advised the Albanians to improve their relations with Yugoslavia, to which Hoxha replied, [...] "We have always wanted to have good relations with Yugoslavia, but to put it bluntly, we do not trust the Yugoslav leaders, because they speak against the social system in our countries and are opposed to the foundations of Marxism-Leninism. In all their propaganda, they do not <b>say</b> <b>one</b> word against imperialism, on the contrary, [...] have joined the chorus of the Western powers against us." [...] He once more said that the Yugoslav leadership failed to understand [...] "any of its grave mistakes and deviations," [...] to which Khrushchev replied that Yugoslavia did not betray Marxism–Leninism though it had [...] "slipped" [...] from its positions. [...] "According to you," [...] Khrushchev continued, [...] "we ought to return to what Stalin did, which caused all these things we know about." [...] The meeting became increasingly acrimonious and when the subject of rehabilitating disgraced Albanian politicians came up Khrushchev eventually concluded, [...] "You are like Stalin who killed people," [...] to which Hoxha replied, [...] "Stalin killed traitors, and we kill them, too." ...|$|E

[...] Daniel of TMZ gave the episode a [...] "D", partially because the twist ending had been spoiled for him.
