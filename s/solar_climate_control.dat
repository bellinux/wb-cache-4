40|$|One of the {{greatest}} problems encountered in greenhouses and buildings with large glazing is control of the internal atmosphere. The inherent characteristic of these buildings to act as solar collectors {{is to be used}} effectively for collecting and storing the excess solar energy. A new type of glazed roof, a <b>Solar</b> <b>Climate</b> <b>Control</b> roof system, was designed as a means to cool the interior environment of the greenhouses during the daytime and to heat during the nighttime or on overcast days. A heat exchanger-storage system, using water as a thermal mass is included {{in the design of the}} <b>Solar</b> <b>Climate</b> <b>Control</b> system. A film of water flows on the inner surface of the roof and absorbs the direct solar heat radiation, acting then as a cooling agent. The energy absorbed may be reused for nighttime heating. An efficient water dispersion pipe for the <b>Solar</b> <b>Climate</b> <b>Control</b> system was developed. The use of a soap solution rather than water alone for the <b>Solar</b> <b>Climate</b> <b>Control</b> water film system permitted a significant reduction in pumping rate and improved uniformity of the film. A computer simulation model was run to determine the energy loads for both a conventional (double glazed roof) greenhouse and one equipped with the <b>Solar</b> <b>Climate</b> <b>Control</b> system. The <b>Solar</b> <b>Climate</b> <b>Control</b> system shows low operating cost and very good efficiency in heat removal...|$|E

50|$|In hot <b>climates,</b> <b>solar</b> <b>control</b> glass {{can be used}} to {{minimize}} solar heat gain and help control glare. The design and placement of glass, known as fenestration, in specific areas of the building crafts the best environment for energy efficiency. In temperate regions, it {{can be used to}} equalize solar control with high levels of natural light. In more serene climates, architects employ operable windows as a cost-saving substitute to air-conditioning.|$|R
40|$|Recently, Diabaté et al. [Diabaté, L., Blanc, Ph., Wald, L., 2004. <b>Solar</b> <b>climate</b> in Africa. <b>Solar</b> Energy 76, 733 – 744] {{created a}} map of <b>solar</b> {{radiation}} <b>climate</b> in Africa using clearness index for 62 sites. They established a <b>solar</b> <b>climate</b> class II located in Malawi and Madagascar. However, their analysis did not include any irradiation data from a site in Malawi. In this study, the <b>solar</b> radiation <b>climate</b> of Malawi has been studied using long-term global radiation data from a local site. The mean monthly (Ktm) and seasonal (Kts) daily clearness indices for the site were computed. It is observed that Ktm has two maxima in a year (Ktm = 0. 58 in May and Ktm = 0. 64 in September), in close conformity with findings of Diabaté et al. (2004).

40|$|Reducing energy {{consumption}} of <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> systems {{is important in}} order to reduce human environmental footprint. The need to save energy becomes even greater when considering an electric car, since heavy use of the <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> system may exhaust the battery. In this paper we consider a method for an automated agent to provide advice to drivers which will motivate them to reduce the {{energy consumption}} of their <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> unit. Our approach takes into account both the energy consumption of the <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> system and the expected comfort level of the driver. We therefore build two models, one for assessing the energy consumption of the <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> system {{as a function of the}} system’s settings, and the other, models human comfort level as a function of the <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> system’s settings. Using these models, the agent provides advice to the driver considering how to set the <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> system. The agent advises settings which try to preserve a high level of comfort while consuming as little energy as possible. We empirically show that drivers equipped with our agent which provides them with advice significantly save energy as compared to drivers not equipped with our agent...|$|R
40|$|Following a {{hot or cold}} thermal soak, vehicle <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> systems (air {{conditioning}} or heat) {{are required}} to quickly attain a cabin temperature comfortable to the vehicle occupants. In a plug-in hybrid electric or electric vehicle (PEV) equipped with electric <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> systems, the traction battery is the sole on-board power source. Depleting the battery for immediate <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> results in reduced charge-depleting (CD) range and additional battery wear. PEV cabin and battery thermal preconditioning using off-board power supplied by the grid or a building can mitigate the impacts of <b>climate</b> <b>control.</b> This analysis shows that <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> loads can reduce CD range up to 35 %. However, cabin thermal preconditioning can increase CD range up to 19 % when compared to no thermal preconditioning. In addition, this analysis shows that while battery capacity loss over time is driven by ambient temperature rather than <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> loads, concurrent battery thermal preconditioning can reduce capacity loss up to 7 % by reducing pack temperature in a high ambient temperature scenario...|$|R

40|$|Using a world multi-sectoral, multi-regional trade model, {{this paper}} has {{investigated}} the economic and environmental implications of <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> coalitions cooperating on R&D investment that triggers low cost environmentally friendly technologies. We start with the Kyoto scenario where all Annex B industrialized countries (including the US) are assumed to individually meet their mandatory Kyoto greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. Next, we consider industrialized country’s cooperating on <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> and R&D-induced technological innovations. We then expand <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> coalition to include developing countries. Finally, we investigate the implications of additional R&D investment from industrialized countries to developing countries. Our results clearly demonstrate that cooperation on <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> and R&D among industrialized countries induces technological innovations, lowers their compliance costs and thus places less strong economic burden on these countries. But without developing countries getting involved in <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> and R&D investment, such a cooperation alone is unable to completely offset negative economic effects of the emissions reduction commitments on both industrialized countries themselves and developing countries. Recognizing the importance of developing countries’ participation and their legitimate demand for adequate technology transfer and financing, the paper concludes that linking developing country’s cooperation on <b>climate</b> <b>control</b> with industrialized country’s R&D and technology transfer would produce win-win-win outcomes for both developing countries and industrialized countries and for the global environment...|$|R
