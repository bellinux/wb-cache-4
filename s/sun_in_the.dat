5|$|When the Italian {{physicist}} Galileo Galilei first {{observed the}} planet in the early 17thcentury, he found it showed phases like the Moon, varying from crescent to gibbous to full and vice versa. When Venus is furthest from the <b>Sun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sky, it shows a half-lit phase, {{and when it is}} closest to the <b>Sun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sky, it shows as a crescent or full phase. This could be possible only if Venus orbited the Sun, and this was among the first observations to clearly contradict the Ptolemaic geocentric model that the Solar System was concentric and centred on Earth.|$|E

5|$|Asteroseismic {{analysis}} of the star reveals it is approximately 10% more massive than the Sun and significantly older, at around 6.34 billion years. The radius of the star is 36% {{greater than that of}} the Sun and it is 90% more luminous. The star contains twice the abundance of iron relative to hydrogen of the Sun and is therefore described as metal-rich. Mu Arae is also more enriched than the <b>Sun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> element helium.|$|E
5|$|At 08:40, the {{opposing}} aircraft strike formations passed {{within sight of}} each other.

5|$|Because the Earth's {{orbit around}} the Sun is also elliptical, the Earth's {{distance}} from the Sun similarly varies throughout the year. This affects the apparent size of the <b>Sun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same way, {{but not as much}} as does the Moon's varying distance from Earth. When Earth approaches its farthest distance from the Sun in early July, a total eclipse is somewhat more likely, whereas conditions favour an annular eclipse when Earth approaches its closest distance to the Sun in early January.|$|E

5|$|From {{at least}} the 4th Dynasty of Ancient Egypt, the Sun was worshipped as the god Ra, portrayed as a falcon-headed divinity surmounted by the solar disk, and {{surrounded}} by a serpent. In the New Empire period, the Sun became identified with the dung beetle, whose spherical ball of dung was identified with the <b>Sun.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> form of the Sun disc Aten, the Sun had a brief resurgence during the Amarna Period when it again became the preeminent, if not only, divinity for the Pharaoh Akhenaton.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the 1963 statute {{came under}} {{criticism}} because it states the <b>sun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state seal is setting rather than rising. A thorough {{investigation by the}} Indiana Historical Bureau {{into the history of}} the seal led to the discovery that original seal was created with the intention that the sun should, in fact, be depicted as rising. In both 2004 and 2005 legislation was introduced to change the wording of the statute, but as of 2008 no action had been taken to correct the error.|$|E
5|$|Most large {{objects in}} orbit around the Sun lie near the plane of Earth's orbit, known as the ecliptic.

5|$|Mu Arae (μ Arae, {{abbreviated}} Mu Ara, μ Ara), often designated HD 160691, {{also named}} Cervantes, is a main sequence G-type star approximately 50 light-years {{away from the}} <b>Sun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> constellation of Ara. The star has a planetary system with four known extrasolar planets (designated Mu Arae b, c, d and e; later named Quijote, Dulcinea, Rocinante and Sancho, respectively), three of them with masses {{comparable to that of}} Jupiter. The system's innermost planet was the first 'hot Neptune' or 'super-Earth' to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|The Sun is {{composed}} primarily {{of the chemical}} elements hydrogen and helium; they account for 74.9% and 23.8% {{of the mass of}} the <b>Sun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> photosphere, respectively.

5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{beliefs are}} one {{possible}} source {{for understanding the}} symbolism in the mysteries of Isis. J. Gwyn Griffiths, an Egyptologist and classical scholar, extensively studied Book 11 of Metamorphoses and its possible Egyptian background. He pointed out similarities between the first initiation in Metamorphoses and Egyptian afterlife beliefs, saying that the initiate took {{on the role of}} Osiris by undergoing symbolic death. In his view, the imagery of the initiation refers to the Egyptian underworld, the Duat. Griffiths argued that the <b>sun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of the night, in Lucius' account of the initiation, might have been influenced by the contrasts of light and dark in other mystery rites, but it derived mainly from the depictions of the underworld in ancient Egyptian funerary texts. According to these texts, the sun god Ra passes through the underworld each night and unites with Osiris to emerge renewed, just as deceased souls do.|$|E
5|$|From 1964–2010, {{and again}} since 2012, the Flag of Malawi {{is made up}} of three equal {{horizontal}} stripes of black, red and green with a red rising sun superimposed {{in the center of the}} black stripe. The black stripe represented the African people, the red represented the blood of martyrs for African freedom, green represented Malawi's ever-green nature and the rising sun represented the dawn of freedom and hope for Africa. In 2010, the flag was changed, removing the red rising sun and adding a full white <b>sun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> center as a symbol of Malawi's economic progress. The change was reverted in 2012.|$|E
5|$|If Sedna {{formed in}} its current location, the Sun's {{original}} protoplanetary disc must have extended as far as 75AU into space. Also, Sedna's initial orbit must have been approximately circular, otherwise its formation by the accretion of smaller bodies into a whole {{would not have been}} possible, because the large relative velocities between planetesimals would have been too disruptive. Therefore, it must have been tugged into its current eccentric orbit by a gravitational interaction with another body. In their initial paper, Brown, Rabinowitz and colleagues suggested three possible candidates for the perturbing body: an unseen planet beyond the Kuiper belt, a single passing star, or one of the young stars embedded with the <b>Sun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stellar cluster in which it formed.|$|E

5|$|On January 28, 1905, {{an article}} {{ran in the}} Indianapolis News {{containing}} information {{on the origin of}} the seal, some of it dubious. The article received much attention and started an informal inquiry into the history of the seal, and namely to discover if the <b>sun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> seal was rising or setting. Jacob Piatt Dunn, the preeminent Indiana historian of the time, consulted several history and arrived at the conclusion that the sun was rising. Dunn cited the fact the state was young, and the mountains were to the east of the state, not the west—clearly indicating the sun was rising.|$|E
5|$|Ritual {{scarification}} in Nri {{was known}} as Ichi {{of which there are}} two styles; the Nri style, and the Agbaja style. In the Nri style, the carved line ran {{from the center of the}} forehead down to the chin. A second line ran across the face, from the right cheek to the left. This was repeated to obtain a pattern meant to imitate the rays of the <b>sun.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Agbaja style, circles and semicircular patterns are added to the initial incisions to represent the moon. These scarifications were given to the representatives of the eze Nri; the mbùríchi. The scarification's were Nri's way of honoring the sun that they worshiped and was a form of ritual purification.|$|E
5|$|Safety {{improvements}} {{continued in}} the 1990s. A five-mile (8km) stretch just west of Aspen was resurfaced in 1991. A special skid-resistant treatment {{was added to the}} areas that receive no <b>sun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> winter due to shade from Shale Bluffs. The next year, in 1992, three two-year projects began expanding Highway 82 to four lanes between Carbondale and Basalt, including the new bypass. An old truss bridge near Wingo Junction was replaced in 1995; it was followed over the remainder of the decade by widening most of the remaining sections between Basalt and Aspen. At the Maroon Creek Bridge outside Aspen, a pedestrian bridge was built to the north to take foot traffic off the older bridge in an effort to relieve congestion.|$|E
