5|$|International Limousin {{genetics}} are {{now widely}} available in many countries for use in artificial insemination programmes, which has been facilitated by {{a large number of}} companies that specialise in the export and import of <b>semen.</b> Details of <b>semen</b> are published in extensively distributed catalogues.|$|E
5|$|The child's sex can be {{influenced}} by factors that affect temperature, including the weather, the wind direction, diet, and the father's age. Features other than sex also depend on whether the <b>semen</b> overpowers the menses, so if a man has strong <b>semen,</b> he will have sons who resemble him, while if the <b>semen</b> is weak, he will have daughters who resemble their mother.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's {{theory has}} some symmetry, as <b>semen</b> {{movements}} carry maleness while the menses carry femaleness. If the <b>semen</b> is {{hot enough to}} overpower the cold menses, the child will be a boy; {{but if it is}} too cold to do this, the child will be a girl. Inheritance is thus particulate (definitely one trait or another), as in Mendelian genetics, unlike the Hippocratic model which was continuous and blending.|$|E
5|$|Book III The {{internal}} organs, including generative system, veins, sinews, bone etc. He {{moves on}} to the blood, bone marrow, milk including rennet and cheese, and <b>semen.</b>|$|E
5|$|In males, the <b>semen</b> {{is forming}} in the testis. The sperm {{structure}} of Theodoxus fluviatilis was examined by Gustaf Retzius. Then <b>semen</b> travels through the prostate, where it mixes with prostatic fluid. Finally {{it goes through}} the vas deferens to the penis. The penis {{is located on the}} inner side of the right tentacle.|$|E
5|$|Lalabhaksa (saliva as food): As per the Bhagavata Purana and the Devi Bhagavata Purana, a Brahmin, a Ksahtriya or a Vaishya husband, who forces {{his wife}} to drink his <b>semen</b> out of lust and to enforce his control, is thrown in a river of <b>semen,</b> which he is forced to drink. The Vishnu Purana disagrees stating that one who eats before {{offering}} food to the gods, the ancestors or guests is brought to this hell.|$|E
5|$|The Bhagavata Purana (6.18.3-6) lists Varuna and Mitra {{as having}} {{children}} through ayoni or non-vaginal sex. For example, Varuna fathered the sage Valmiki when his <b>semen</b> fell upon a termite mound, and Agastya and Vasistha were born from water pots after Mitra and Varuna discharged their <b>semen</b> {{in the presence}} of Urvasi. This account is similar to Gay couples having children through surrogate mothers in modern days.|$|E
5|$|The {{approach}} in these sheep experiments involves irradiating a ram’s testes while placing {{stem cells from}} a second ram into the testes of the first, ram A. In the following weeks ram A produces <b>semen</b> the usual way, but is using the stem cells of ram B and therefore producing <b>semen</b> carrying the genetics of ram B rather than those of his own. Ram A therefore has effectively become a surrogate ram.|$|E
5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. First, the father's <b>semen</b> curdles the mother's menses, which Aristotle compares with how rennet (an enzyme from a cow's stomach) curdles milk in cheesemaking. This forms the embryo; {{it is then}} {{developed}} {{by the action of}} the pneuma (literally, breath or spirit) in the <b>semen.</b> The pneuma first makes the heart appear; this is vital, as the heart nourishes all other organs. Aristotle observed that the heart is the first organ seen to be active (beating) in a hen's egg. The pneuma then makes the other organs develop.|$|E
5|$|Before courtship, a male Portia spins a small web between boughs or twigs, and {{he hangs}} under that and ejaculates on to it. He then {{takes up the}} <b>semen</b> into {{reservoirs}} in the palpal bulbs on his pedipalps.|$|E
5|$|In the Agni Purana, as the enchanted Shiva follows Mohini, {{drops of}} his <b>semen</b> {{falls on the}} ground and become lingas, Shiva's symbols. His <b>semen</b> also generates the monkey-god Hanuman, who helps Vishnu's avatar Rama in his fight against Ravana in the Ramayana. Shiva Purana says that by the mere glimpse of Mohini, Shiva spurts out his seed. The seed was {{collected}} and poured into the ear of Anjani, who gave birth to Hanuman, the incarnation of Shiva. The latter is retold in the Thai and Malaysian version of the Ramayana. Though Hanuman strings from Shiva's seed, he is also considered as a combined son of Vishnu and Shiva.|$|E
5|$|Most {{men have}} a normal sperm count, but a high {{proportion}} of sperm are abnormal; they are less motile and do not survive as well. The reason for these abnormalities is not known, but research points to dysfunction of the seminal vesicles and prostate, which concentrate substances that are toxic to sperm. Cytokines, immune proteins which promote an inflammatory response, are present at higher concentrations in <b>semen</b> of men with SCI, as is platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase; both are harmful to sperm. Another immune-related response to SCI is the presence of a higher number of white blood cells in the <b>semen.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other {{potential}} {{uses for}} extracts of Aloe vera include the dilution of <b>semen</b> for the artificial fertilization of sheep, as a fresh food preservative, or for water conservation in small farms. It {{has also been}} suggested that biofuels could be obtained from Aloe vera seeds.|$|E
5|$|The name {{sperm whale}} is a {{truncation}} of spermaceti whale. Spermaceti, originally mistakenly {{identified as the}} whales' <b>semen,</b> is the semi-liquid, waxy substance found within the whale's head (see below).|$|E
5|$|The viable <b>semen</b> is then {{implanted}} in the ewe and the many lambs born through this process are proving to be normal and healthy. DNA tests have proved that up to 10% of the lambs are sired by the surrogate ram and carry the genetics of the donor ram.|$|E
5|$|According to the legend, Vasu (also {{known as}} Uparicara Vasu), a Chedi King, {{was on a}} hunting {{expedition}} {{when he had a}} nocturnal emission while dreaming of his wife. Using an eagle, He sent his <b>semen</b> to his queen but due to a fight mid-air with another eagle, the <b>semen</b> fell into the river and was swallowed by the cursed Adrika-fish. Consequently, the fish became pregnant. Soon, A fisherman caught the pregnant fish and cut it open to find two babies in the womb of the fish, one male and one female. The fisherman presented the children to the king, who kept the male child. The boy grew up to become King Matsya, the founder of the Matsya Kingdom. The king gave the female child back to the fisherman, naming her Matsya-gandha ("She who smells like fish"). The fisherman raised the girl as his daughter and named her Kali ("the dark one") because of her complexion. Over the course of time, Kali earned the name Satyavati ("truthful"). The fisherman was also a ferryman, ferrying people across the river in his boat. Satyavati helped her father, the fisherman, in his job and grew up into a beautiful maiden.|$|E
5|$|After {{almost three}} years of touring to promote the album Metallica, {{including}} a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus {{in the summer of}} 1995 and played three outdoor shows that included headlining at Donington Park, where it was supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash's Snakepit, Therapy?, and Corrosion of Conformity. The short tour was titled Escape from the Studio '95. The band spent about a year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of Load in 1996. Load debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and ARIA Charts; it was the band's second number one album. The cover art of Load, called Blood and <b>Semen</b> III, was created by Andres Serrano, who pressed a mixture of his own <b>semen</b> and blood between sheets of plexiglass. The release marked a change in the band's musical direction and a new image; band members' hair was cut. Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza in mid-1996.|$|E
5|$|An {{essential}} step in {{the global}} spread of the Limousin breed was made in 1968 with the importation of the first bull, Prince Pompadour, to Canada. The <b>semen</b> of this bull was {{made available to the}} United States in 1969. During the early 1970s, imports of animals to North America started to grow strongly. Today, the North American Limousin Foundation is the largest global Limousin breeders' association.|$|E
5|$|Between 2 and 4 {{grams of}} zinc are {{distributed}} throughout the human body. Most zinc is in the brain, muscle, bones, kidney, and liver, with the highest concentrations in the prostate {{and parts of the}} eye. <b>Semen</b> is particularly rich in zinc, a key factor in prostate gland function and reproductive organ growth.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{barriers}} also {{protect against}} infection. The skin and respiratory tract secrete antimicrobial peptides {{such as the}} β-defensins. Enzymes such as lysozyme and phospholipase A2 in saliva, tears, and breast milk are also antibacterials. Vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier following menarche, when they become slightly acidic, while <b>semen</b> contains defensins and zinc to kill pathogens. In the stomach, gastric acid and proteases serve as powerful chemical defenses against ingested pathogens.|$|E
5|$|Each morph {{accounts}} for 50% {{of the adult}} males, and they make {{the same number of}} attempts to court females, but using a different courting display. Before looking for a mate, a male spider spins a small, flat web on a surface and ejaculates into it. He then loads the <b>semen</b> into syringe-like receptacles in both palps, and then searches for a female.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, an Oregon {{sheep farmer}} began {{importing}} <b>semen</b> from Herdwick rams into the United States {{to begin a}} breeding program using artificial insemination and designed to bring the breed to {{the country for the}} first time. In 2013, Lakeland Herdwick meat received a Protected Designation of Origin from the European Union.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{identification}} of HIV {{as the cause of}} AIDS in 1984, Sonnabend's investigations led him to propose that AIDS among gay men might be caused by multiple factors including Epstein–Barr virus and repeated exposure to cytomegalovirus and <b>semen.</b> This suggestion conflicted with the prevailing view that a single agent was likely responsible.|$|E
5|$|The innate {{sexuality}} of bloodsucking {{can be seen}} in its intrinsic {{connection with}} cannibalism and folkloric one with incubus-like behaviour. Many legends report various beings draining other fluids from victims, an unconscious association with <b>semen</b> being obvious. Finally Jones notes that when more normal aspects of sexuality are repressed, regressed forms may be expressed, in particular sadism; he felt that oral sadism is integral in vampiric behaviour.|$|E
5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. The father's <b>semen</b> and the mother's menses have {{movements}} that encode their parental characteristics. The model is partly asymmetric, as only the father's movements define the form or eidos of the species, while {{the movements of}} both the father's and the mother's uniform parts define features other than the form, such as the father's eye colour or the mother's nose shape.|$|E
5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. The {{incoming}} material, food, enters {{the body and}} is concocted into blood; waste is excreted as urine, bile, and faeces, and the element fire is released as heat. Blood is made into flesh, the rest forming other earthy tissues such as bones, teeth, cartilages and sinews. Leftover blood is made into fat, whether soft suet or hard lard. Some fat {{from all around the}} body is made into <b>semen.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} episode concerns mutilations {{that the}} combatants inflict upon each other: Horus injures or steals Set's testicles and Set damages or tears out one, or occasionally both, of Horus's eyes. Sometimes {{the eye is}} torn into pieces. Set's mutilation signifies a loss of virility and strength. The removal of Horus's eye is even more important, for this stolen Eye of Horus represents {{a wide variety of}} concepts in Egyptian religion. One of Horus's major roles is as a sky deity, and for this reason his right eye was said to be the sun and his left eye the moon. The theft or destruction of the Eye of Horus is therefore equated with the darkening of the moon in the course of its cycle of phases, or during eclipses. Horus may take back his lost Eye, or other deities, including Isis, Thoth, and Hathor, may retrieve or heal it for him. The Egyptologist Herman te Velde argues that the tradition about the lost testicles is a late variation on Set's loss of <b>semen</b> to Horus, and that the moon-like disk that emerges from Set's head after his impregnation is the Eye of Horus. If so, the episodes of mutilation and sexual abuse would form a single story, in which Set assaults Horus and loses <b>semen</b> to him, Horus retaliates and impregnates Set, and Set comes into possession of Horus's Eye when it appears on Set's head. Because Thoth is a moon deity in addition to his other functions, it would make sense, according to te Velde, for Thoth to emerge {{in the form of the}} Eye and step in to mediate between the feuding deities.|$|E
5|$|Before courtship, male spiders spin a small web and {{ejaculate}} on to it, {{and then}} store the <b>semen</b> in reservoirs on his pedipalps, which {{are larger than}} those of females. Phaeacius spins a flimsy silken, horizontal or vertical platform, about twice the spider's length in diameter, to moult and lay eggs, but not at other times. After the moult, Phaeacius leaves the discarded exuvia hanging from the platform. A female's egg sac is placed in a shallow cavity {{on the surface of}} a log.|$|E
5|$|Charles I of Naples {{signed an}} {{alliance}} with Split and Šibenik against Omiš pirates in June and September 1274. The citizens of Omiš responded by {{an alliance with}} Venice in August, in accordance with a 20-year peace treaty signed by knezes Radoš, Bogdan, Juraj and <b>Semen.</b> This triggered conflict on the land and sea in 1275. The activities in the intermediate years are unknown, besides that in April 1278 the islands of Hvar and Brač recognized Venetian authority, and the Omiš in 1281.|$|E
5|$|Currently, only cattle {{recorded}} in the French Limousin Certified Purebred sub-class 2 and Registered Purebred class satisfy the requirements of EU law on herd books and can be transferred as Limousins, including indirectly through their genetics (for example <b>semen</b> and embryos), to other EU countries and {{recorded in}} the respective herd books. Outside of the EU, {{the rules and regulations}} of Limousin breed associations do not yet differentiate between the French Pureblood and Purebred classes, with the Pureblood class remaining the origin of, and standard for, the purest form of Limousin.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{weeks after}} the {{incident}} with the ambulance, Mac is in a coma and Guy has been suspended from his job. Caroline is {{spending too much time}} with Mac, in Sue's opinion, and tries to stop her from seeing him. During his coma, Sue steals some of Mac's <b>semen</b> to make herself pregnant. Mac then comes out of his coma, but is suffering from memory loss and cannot remember his new-found love for Caroline. Angela soon leaves the hospital in order to take a career in television. With Angela gone, Guy becomes Caroline's new lodger.|$|E
5|$|In {{the male}} frog, the two testes are {{attached}} to the kidneys and <b>semen</b> passes into the kidneys through fine tubes called efferent ducts. It then travels on through the ureters, which are consequently known as urinogenital ducts. There is no penis, and sperm is ejected from the cloaca directly onto the eggs as the female lays them. The ovaries of the female frog are beside the kidneys and the eggs pass down a pair of oviducts and through the cloaca to the exterior.|$|E
5|$|Jaguar females reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{about two years}} of age, and males at three or four. The cat is believed to mate throughout {{the year in the}} wild, although births may increase when prey is plentiful. Research on captive male jaguars supports the year-round mating hypothesis, with no seasonal variation in <b>semen</b> traits and ejaculatory quality; low reproductive success has also been observed in captivity. Female estrus is 6–17 days out of a full 37-day cycle, and females will advertise fertility with urinary scent marks and increased vocalization. Both sexes will range more widely than usual during courtship.|$|E
5|$|Limousins {{ability to}} adapt to {{different}} environments contributed greatly to the breed's current success outside France. In most cases, Limousin bulls or their <b>semen</b> are now imported to improve locally bred Limousins. Today, the breed is present in about 70 countries around the world, and in all latitudes ranging from Finland in the north to South Africa in the south. Limousin breeders' associations exist {{in many of these}} countries, of which 29 are members of the International Limousin Council (ILC). The ILC was founded at Limoges in 1973 by Louis de Neuville, the Limousin breed ambassador. In 1989, EUROLIM was formed to bring together all of the herd books of European Limousins.|$|E
5|$|Sexuality {{played an}} {{important}} role in Crowley's ideas about magick and his practice of it, and has been described as being central to Thelema. He outlined three forms of sex magick—the autoerotic, homosexual, and heterosexual—and argued that such acts could be used to focus the magician's will onto a specific goal such as financial gain or personal creative success. For Crowley, sex was treated as a sacrament, with the consumption of sexual fluids interpreted as a Eucharist. This was often manifested as the Cakes of Light, a biscuit containing either menstrual blood or a mixture of <b>semen</b> and vaginal fluids. The Gnostic Mass is the central religious ceremony within Thelema.|$|E
5|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes HIV infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is a condition in humans in which progressive failure {{of the immune system}} allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive. Without treatment, average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11years, depending on the HIV subtype. Infection with HIV occurs by the transfer of blood, pre-ejaculate, <b>semen,</b> vaginal fluids, or breast milk. Within these bodily fluids, HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells.|$|E
