40|$|This {{paper on}} the outer-blade slicing {{analyzes}} {{the effects of the}} <b>side</b> <b>relief</b> <b>angle</b> a of the blade on the slicing mechanism theoretically. The main results obtained are as follows. (1) The larger α, the smaller the maximum value of the lateral grinding force component F_z. (2) The difference between the maximum values of F_z under the different conditions of γ_s (γ_s denotes the average half-tip angle of the abrasive grains on the blade side face) decreases with an increase in α. (3) A moderate value of a decreases the maximum blade deflection D_B largely, while too large a value of a increases D_B due to lessening of the flexural rigidity of the blade. (4) The difference between the values of D_B under the different conditions of γ_s decreases with an increase in α. (5) The flatness of the cutoff surface generated on the blade deflection side is improved largely with a moderate value of α, while that on the opposite side is deteriorated. (6) A moderate value of α decreases the kerfloss V_L largely. (7) V_L increases with an increase in γ_s in the case of α close to zero, while the tendency is reversed {{in the case of a}} exceeding a certain value...|$|E

In some milling scenarios, process damping is a useful phenomenon that can be exploited to mitigate chatter and hence improve productivity. In the present study, experiments {{are performed to evaluate}} the performance of process damped milling considering different tool geometries (edge radius, rake and <b>relief</b> <b>angles</b> and variable helix/pitch). The results clearly indicate that variable helix/pitch angles most significantly increase process damping performance. Additionally, increased cutting edge radius moderately improves process damping performance, while rake and <b>relief</b> <b>angles</b> have a smaller and closely coupled effect...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of shear textures and band-like {{features in the}} microstructure of commercially pure (CP) aluminum have been studied {{as a function of}} backpressure and die <b>relief</b> <b>angle</b> during equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) through a die with a 90 ◦ die channel angle. Microtexture data were acquired by orientation imaging microscopy (OIM) following one pass and four repetitive passes by route A. In a 90 ◦ die with zero <b>relief</b> <b>angle,</b> the microtexture data indicate that ECAP involves simple shear on a shear plane and in a shear direction that are rotated away from the plane of the die channel intersection toward the die exit channel. This rotation reflects the spreading of shear deformation through a fan-shaped region around the plane of the die channel intersection. The superposition of backpressure suppresses this spreading and the texture data indicate that deformation is confined to the plane of the die channel intersection, while the introduction of a <b>relief</b> <b>angle</b> at the outer corner of the die channel intersection promotes spreading and leads to further rotation of the shear plane and shear direction toward the axis of the die exit channel. Splitting of shear texture components is observed after the initial ECAP pass. Such splitting appears in the microstructure as band-like features separated by sub-grains. Band-like features became apparent in the microstructure after the initial pass and persisted through four ECAP passes by route A; these features become more prominent with increasing die <b>relief</b> <b>angle...</b>|$|R

A bottleneck {{is the absence of}} a strict and systematic measurement method. The present paper introduced a new measurement method based on the EBSD and AFM technology. Various crystallographic features were quantitatively determined by this method, including the orientation relationship (OR), the orientation of the habit plane (10), the displacement vector inducing the surface relief and the maximum <b>relief</b> <b>angle.</b> The OR and 10 were consistently in agreement with the calculated results from the O-line method.

40|$|Abstract. The copying {{characteristic}} of the tool motion on the workpiece profiles is investigated. Assuming that the workpiece profile consists of sinusoidal-wave components, the amplitude ratio between the workpiece profile and the tool motion is defined as copying rate rC. An experiment was conducted to identify rC in shaping of electroless plated nickel. With polycrystalline diamond tools, the copying rate was obtained as rC = 1. 16. The result indicates that the amplitude of the workpiece profile can be larger {{than that of the}} tool motion. Shaping of slot profiles was carried out to investigate the influences of depth of cut, rake <b>angle</b> and <b>relief</b> <b>angle</b> on the copying characteristic. The depth of slot was larger than the tool displacement in the Z-direction by 0. 1 - 0. 4 µm when the rake angle was- 5 degrees and the <b>relief</b> <b>angle</b> was 12 degrees. 1...|$|R
5000|$|The cutters {{most often}} used to cut spotfaces are {{counterbore}} cutters and endmills. In manual machining especially, the former is useful because its pilot guides the cutter into the correct location (established by the bolt hole), and its cutting lips are perpendicular to the hole axis with no <b>relief</b> <b>angle,</b> meaning that a plunging cut, moving in only the Z-axis, will leave a flat surface. In contrast, most general-purpose endmills have a <b>relief</b> <b>angle</b> such that a plunging cut (Z-axis-only toolpath) will leave a very slightly convex surface. But in CNC machining this is irrelevant, because the flat spotface is left by circular interpolation of the endmill as it traces a circular toolpath in the XY plane. Zero-angle cutters obviate this, functioning similarly to the traditional counterbore cutters of manual machining but needing no pilot. Spot facing of larger planar surfaces sometimes employs face mills.|$|R
40|$|Orthogonal cutting {{tests were}} carried out on {{unidirectional}} glass-fibre-reinforced plastics, using high-speed steel tools. During the tests, the tool rake and <b>relief</b> <b>angle,</b> {{and the depth of}} cut t were varied, whereas the cutting direction was held parallel to the fibre orientation. The trend of the principal forces recorded during cutting clearly showed the so-called `size effect': the unit cutting force (also known as `specific energy') was a decreasing function of the depth of cut, tending to infinity for vanishingly small values of t. A previous force scheme, assuming a significant influence of the friction generated by the work material sliding along the tool flank on the overall cutting forces, was utilized to interpret the cutting data, and to differently define the unit cutting force. According to the model, the unit cutting force and the coefficient of friction were independent of both the <b>relief</b> <b>angle</b> and the depth of cut, although the former, as expected, sensibly decreased with increasing the rake angle...|$|R

A novel {{algorithm}} for the {{ball-end mill}} relief using a five-axis {{computer numerical control}} (CNC) grinding machine and the simulation of the ball-end mill based on a CAM system is presented in this paper. In this study, In order to obtain an accurate normal <b>relief</b> <b>angle,</b> {{which is one of}} the key factors affecting tool cutting performance, a tool coordinate system based on the required <b>relief</b> <b>angle</b> and the cutting edge was established. Then, by the proposed tool coordinate system, an algorithm to determine the position between the grinding wheel and the tool is proposed, and then the relevant formulations are deduced. The coordinates of grinding point when the step of relief surface is grinded are calculated. Using the input data of a ball-end mill geometry, wheels geometry, wheel setting and machine setting, the NC code for machining will be generated. Then the code will be used as input to simulate the ball-end mill machining in 3 Dimension before real machining. The algorithm of ball-end mill relief can be authenticated by the 3 D simulation system...|$|R

And the stress <b>relief</b> <b>angles</b> along incline and strike according to the rules of stress and deformation were obtained. Then the protective area resulted from exploiting the lower protective coal seam were acquired. The results show that the stress <b>relief</b> <b>angles</b> along incline are 75. 5 and 77. 7 degrees, the ones along strike are 78. 4 and 83. 5 degrees in the sense of protection when the advancing distance is 300 m. But the real effective protective area is much smaller. The largest degree of stress relief locates in the protected coal seam corresponding to the upper and middle of the working face. According the simulation results and the water inrush coefficient method of effective water-resisting seam, the water inrush risk area of lower protective coal seam was divided, and the feasibility of exploiting protective coal seam was analysed and judged.

The development and application of green cutting depend on the machine and cutting tool technology progress, in so far as the development of cutting tool technology has quite a big influence. The study was focused on the simulation analysis model for micro milling SKD 61 tool steel developed by the finite element method. First, because the impact of the effective rake angle on the oblique cutting model is equivalent to that of the rake angle on the orthogonal cut model, the complex tool geometry of an end-mill will be simplified to the orthogonal cutting model. Using the Taguchi method, the FEM simulation of orthogonal cutting operation was performed under different cutting speeds, cutting depths, effective rake <b>angles</b> and <b>relief</b> <b>angles</b> were modified. The cutting force, tool maximum temperature, tool maximum temperature and tip distance, and the contact length of tool and chip are the major performance indexes of micro milling process. Finally, the multiple cutting performance characteristic resulting from the grey relational analysis reveals that the influencing priority ranks for micro end-mills made of SKD 61 tool steel are cutting speed, effective rake <b>angle,</b> <b>relief</b> <b>angle,</b> and cutting depth. The FEM model is suitable for simulating the cutting performance of micro cutting process, and can also be used as a design base for micro endmills...|$|R
