500|$|Swanigan {{had several}} teams recruit him and offer scholarships; Arizona, Kentucky, Cal, and Duke {{were among the}} schools that gave Swanigan an offer. Caleb Swanigan {{verbally}} committed to Michigan State on April 10, 2015, but decommitted on May 7. He said, [...] "I just {{felt like it was}} better basketball-wise for me." [...] Similar to his high school decision, Barnes said, [...] "He wants to win a national championship and <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> do it in the state of Indiana and wanted to do it at a place he's never done it before." [...] Some people believe Barnes had ulterior motives in adopting Swanigan, to which Barnes said, [...] "Maybe if I wanted to develop the next hot-dog-eating champion, the next Joey Chestnut, people would have a legitimate gripe." [...] Swanigan had not consulted Barnes before he committed to Michigan State, and some believe that since Barnes played sports at Purdue he was a major influence in Swanigan decommitting from Michigan State. Barnes said that was not the reason Swanigan switched, and the primary reason for Swanigan choosing Purdue was the presence of two centers that were taller than 7', Isaac Haas and A.J. Hammons, which allowed Swanigan to play the 4 spot.|$|E

2500|$|West {{described}} Stan as [...] "tough and lonely" [...] and [...] "concerned" [...] {{that there}} is nobody around him as he ages.

2500|$|In September 2008, Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez sued Casey Anthony for defamation. During the investigation, Anthony told {{investigators}} that she left 2½-year-old Caylee with a babysitter named Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez—also known as [...] "Zanny"—on June 16 at the stairs of a specific apartment in the Sawgrass apartment complex located in Orlando. Fernandez-Gonzalez, who was listed on apartment records as having visited apartments on that date, was questioned by police, but stated {{she did not know}} Casey or Caylee Anthony. Her defamation suit seeks compensatory and punitive damages, alleging that Casey willfully damaged her reputation. Fernandez-Gonzalez has told reporters that she lost her job, was evicted from her house, and received death threats against herself and her children as a result of Anthony's lies. Fernandez-Gonzalez' lawyer, John Morgan, <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> interrogate Anthony about Caylee's death because it is [...] "the essence" [...] of the defamation suit. On October 8, 2011, Morgan deposed Anthony via a video conference. As expected, Anthony exercised her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and answered only a couple of factual questions. Morgan felt that was improper, but legal experts think that Anthony is well within her rights to plead the Fifth until her appeals of the convictions for lying to officers are exhausted. Fernandez-Gonzalez' attorneys sought and received permission to obtain Anthony's address (though it was kept sealed from the public) so they could subpoena her to testify, even if she only took the stand long enough to plead the Fifth. However, Fernandez-Gonzalez is willing to drop the suit if Anthony apologizes to her and compensates her for pain and suffering. In September 2015, a judge ruled in favor of Anthony, stating: [...] "There is nothing in the statement…to support (Fernandez-Gonzalez's) allegations that (Anthony) intended to portray (the nanny) as a child kidnapper and potentially a child killer." ...|$|E
