40|$|Internet-enabled {{markets are}} {{becoming}} viable venues for procurement of professional services. We investigate bidding behavior within {{the most active}} area of these early knowledge markets [...] -the market for <b>software</b> <b>development.</b> These markets are important both because they provide an early view {{of the effectiveness of}} online service markets and because they have a potentially large impact on how <b>software</b> <b>development</b> <b>services</b> are procured and provided. Using auction theory, we develop a theoretical model that relates market characteristics to bidding and transaction behavior, taking into account costly bidding. We then test our model using data from an active online market for <b>software</b> <b>development</b> <b>services,</b> which yields contracts for 30 % [...] 40 % of posted projects. In its current format, however, the studied market may induce excessive bidding by vendors. Consistent with our theoretical predictions and those of Carr (2003), higher-value projects attract significantly more bids, with lower average quality. Greater numbers of bids raise the cost to all participants, due to costly bidding and bid evaluation. Perhaps as a consequence, higher-value projects are also much less likely to be awarded.
