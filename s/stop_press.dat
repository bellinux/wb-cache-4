"In the January 2008 {{issue of}} Drug Safety Update, a <b>Stop</b> <b>press</b> article {{announced}} the recent European review of carisoprodol {{for which the}} Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the risks of treatment outweigh the benefits. This review was triggered by concerns from the Norwegian Medical Agency that carisoprodol (converted to meprobamate after administration) was associated with increased risk of abuse, addiction, intoxication, and psychomotor impairment."

2500|$|In 1928, she {{designed}} the costumes for This Year of Grace by Noël Coward (also {{referred to as}} [...] "Cochran's Revue" [...] or [...] "Cochran's 1928 Revue") at the London Pavilion. In 1933, Zinkeison {{designed the}} decor and costumes for Cochran's production of Cole Porter's musical Nymph Errant at the Adelphi Theatre in London. The décolletage formed by the low cut design {{of one of the}} costumes resulted in a strike by the chorus against the perceived indecency of the costume. Theatre manager C. B. Cochran was compelled to have the waistcoat altered to fill up the gap with gauze. In 1934, she designed the costumes for the Broadway musical The Great Waltz at the Center Theatre, together with Marion Claire, Marie Burke and Guy Robertson. In 1935, she designed the costumes and sets for <b>Stop</b> <b>Press,</b> the retitled London based version of the As Thousands Cheer revue by Moss Hart and Irving Berlin at the Adelphi Theatre. After the Blitz, during the Second World War, she designed costumes and sets for the Old Vic Company productions of Arms and the Man and Richard III with Ralph Richardson, Sybil Thorndike and Laurence Olivier at the New Theatre.|$|E

6000|$|Coming {{out of the}} Law Courts on the {{afternoon}} of January 28th, at the triumphant end of a desperately fought will case, Keith saw on a poster the words: [...] "Glove Lane Murder: Trial and Verdict"; and with a rush of dismay he thought: 'Good God! I never looked at the paper this morning!' The elation which had filled him a second before, the absorption he had felt for two days now in the case so hardly won, seemed suddenly quite sickeningly trivial. What on earth had he been doing to forget that horrible business even for an instant? He stood quite still on the crowded pavement, unable, really unable, to buy a paper. But his face was like a piece of iron when he did step forward and hold his penny out. There it was in the <b>Stop</b> <b>Press!</b> [...] "Glove Lane Murder. The jury returned a verdict of Guilty. Sentence of death was passed." ...|$|E

There {{it was in}} the <b>stop</b> <b>press...!</b> His first thought was: 'The Boers are {{committing}} suicide.' His second: 'Is there anything still I ought to sell?' If so he had missed the chance--there would certainly be a slump in the city to-morrow. He swallowed this thought with a nod of defiance. That ultimatum was insolent--sooner than let it pass he was prepared to lose money. They wanted a lesson, and they would get it; but it would take three months at least to bring them to heel. There weren't the troops out there; always behind time, the Government! Confound those newspaper rats! What was the use of waking everybody up? Breakfast to-morrow was quite soon enough. And he thought with alarm of his father. They would cry it down Park Lane. Hailing a hansom, he got in and told the man to drive there.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cauldron}} {{was installed}} in {{the centre of the}} arena of the Olympic stadium using a 500-ton crane. This was done overnight on 10 June 2012, in order to maintain secrecy. [...] It was only tested at night during the time that the Olympic airspace restrictions were in place, which <b>stopped</b> <b>press</b> helicopters from getting a view. Part of the cauldron failed during final testing the night before the opening ceremony; this news was deliberately withheld from Heatherwick. Despite all this secrecy, the cauldron was [...] "cheekily hidden in plain sight" [...] in the design on the ceremony ticket wallets.|$|R

[...] She caught the child up in her arms as it <b>stopped,</b> <b>pressed</b> the nail-lined face to hers, and turned about to run towards her lair, the lair of the old lion. The old woman stood waist-high in the reeds, and screamed foul things and inarticulate rage, but did not dare to intercept her; and at the bend of the path Eudena looked back and saw all {{the men of the}} tribe crying to one another and Siss coming at a trot along the lion's trail.|$|R
60|$|A last lonely candle wandered {{up the sky}} from Mirus bazaar {{in search}} of funds for Mercer's {{hospital}} and broke, drooping, and shed a cluster of violet but one white stars. They floated, fell: they faded. The shepherd's hour: the hour of folding: hour of tryst. From house to house, giving his everwelcome double knock, went the nine o'clock postman, the glowworm's lamp at his belt gleaming here and there through the laurel hedges. And among the five young trees a hoisted lintstock lit the lamp at Leahy's terrace. By screens of lighted windows, by equal gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing: Evening Telegraph, <b>stop</b> <b>press</b> edition! Result of the Gold Cup race! and from the door of Dignam's house a boy ran out and called. Twittering the bat flew here, flew there. Far out over the sands the coming surf crept, grey. Howth settled for slumber, tired of long days, of yumyum rhododendrons (he was old) and felt gladly the night breeze lift, ruffle his fell of ferns. He lay but opened a red eye unsleeping, deep and slowly breathing, slumberous but awake. And far on Kish bank the anchored lightship twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom.|$|E

40|$|This study’s aim was {{to examine}} how {{attention}} is affected by action words. Twenty participants performed a cross‐modal oddball task with a standard sound (a sine wave tone) and two recorded speech sounds as novel sounds (<b>stop</b> and <b>press).</b> The result showed that novel sounds captured attention and increased response time compared to standard. There {{was a significant difference}} between “press” and standard and “stop” and standard but not between <b>stop</b> and <b>press.</b> This showed that the participants could not block out the sound and focus on the focal attention task. Even though not significant, the response time for “stop” was the slowest since it may inhibit the involuntary response. The results might be {{explained by the fact that}} not enough subjects participated, and because of that same reason the result might not be generalized either...|$|R
