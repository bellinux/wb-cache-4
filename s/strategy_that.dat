5|$|Since 1994, the Wonderbra has {{expanded}} from the single push-up design into a full-range lingerie fashion label {{in most of}} the world. In most countries, the brand emphasizes sex-appeal. In its native Canada, however, the brand promotes the functional qualities of its products—a departure from the <b>strategy</b> <b>that</b> made Wonderbra the top-seller in the 1970s.|$|E

40|$|Constructivism is a {{philosophy}} that supports student construction of knowledge. Since students uniquely construct their knowledge, instructional <b>strategies</b> <b>that</b> support constructivist philosophies naturally advocate student understanding. Instructional trends in the mathematics and statistics education communities support the active-learning orientation of constructivist philosophy. I posit that, while not the only philosophy of teaching and learning, constructivism {{is one of the}} best such philosophies. One question remains: "How do instructional <b>strategies</b> <b>that</b> support student knowledge construction address the needs of all students? " I first examine learning styles in general, then enumerate a collection of instructional <b>strategies</b> <b>that</b> support constructivism, and conclude with an analysis of how instructional <b>strategies</b> <b>that</b> support constructivism address the needs of the learning styles previously examined...|$|R
5|$|The ARF {{is often}} {{accused of having}} a present <b>strategy</b> <b>that</b> does not differ from the one used {{during the time of}} the Ottoman Empire. Its tactics are viewed as still being aimed at convincing Western governments and {{diplomatic}} circles to sponsor the party's demands.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} the Royal Irish patrol {{reinforced}} to the British government that its efforts so far—and those of the international community—would {{not be sufficient to}} bring the civil war to an end. In Westminster, meanwhile, opposition politicians renewed their objection to the continued presence of British forces in Sierra Leone. The government was seeking an exit <b>strategy</b> <b>that</b> would end a politically unpopular deployment without abandoning Sierra Leone.|$|E
5|$|A small neutral bloc arose {{with the}} Non-Aligned Movement; it sought good {{relations}} with both sides. The two superpowers never engaged directly in full-scale armed combat, but they were heavily armed {{in preparation for a}} possible all-out nuclear world war. Each side had a nuclear <b>strategy</b> <b>that</b> discouraged an attack by the other side, on the basis that such an attack would lead to the total destruction of the attacker—the doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD). Aside from the development of the two sides' nuclear arsenals, and their deployment of conventional military forces, the struggle for dominance was expressed via proxy wars around the globe, psychological warfare, massive propaganda campaigns and espionage, rivalry at sports events, and technological competitions such as the Space Race.|$|E
50|$|Work-force {{development}} has historically occurred in two forms: place-based <b>strategies</b> <b>that</b> attempt {{to address the}} needs of people living in a particular neighborhood, and sector-based <b>strategies</b> <b>that</b> focus on matching workers' skills to needs in an industry already present in the region.|$|R
40|$|College {{students}} {{learning about}} language and using this knowledge {{to learn how}} to teach reading and writing should participate in <b>strategies</b> <b>that</b> simulate systems in the language and <b>strategies</b> <b>that</b> they in turn will use in their own classrooms. Cognitive and constructivist strategies are interactive and thus more powerful than the traditional lecture method of teaching college students, yet too often the traditional method prevails. Four interactive <b>strategies</b> <b>that</b> we have used successfully are cooperative learning, semantic feature analysis, nonsense story analysis, and fictitious writing systems. Surveys, exams, and informal discussions with students following the use of these <b>strategies</b> indicate <b>that</b> students found these strategies to be very effective...|$|R

5|$|As {{technical}} director of Digital's Corporate Strategy Group, Kotok {{was instrumental in}} creating the Internet Business Group which advocated early adoption and integration of Internet and Web-based technologies. Digital created the AltaVista search engine, the Internet firewall, the Web portal, the webcast and live election returns. Digital continued its lead in Internet and Web development through difficult times, but Kotok questioned a corporate <b>strategy</b> <b>that</b> he believed consumed Web and Internet resources to sell Digital products like the AlphaServer. For example, he saw a missed opportunity in Millicent, the micropayment system for buying and selling Web content for fractions of a U.S. cent.|$|E
5|$|From 1993 to 1996, Apple {{developed}} a marketing <b>strategy</b> <b>that</b> promised free and unlimited live-telephone support on certain products {{for as long}} as the original purchaser owned those products; by 1997, however, changes in Apple's AppleCare support policy led Apple to rescind the offer, resulting in a consumer class action lawsuit for breach of contract. Apple denied wrongdoing but, in settlement of the claims, Apple ultimately reinstated the telephone support for the duration of original ownership of the otherwise obsolete products and customers affected by the change were given a limited reimbursement if they had been refused telephone support, had been charged per incident, or had incurred third party support charges.|$|E
5|$|In early 1977, TSR {{created the}} first element of a two-pronged <b>strategy</b> <b>that</b> would divide D for nearly two decades. A Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set boxed edition was {{introduced}} that cleaned up {{the presentation of the}} essential rules, made the system understandable to the general public, and was sold in a package that could be stocked in toy stores. Later in 1977, the first part of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD) was published, which brought together the various published rules, options and corrections, then expanded them into a definitive, unified game for hobbyist gamers. TSR marketed them as an introductory game for new players and a more complex game for experienced ones; the Basic Set directed players who exhausted the possibilities of that game to switch to the advanced rules.|$|E

A series of studies reported by Niven and colleagues generated almost 400 unique <b>strategies</b> <b>that</b> could be differentiated primarily according to whether {{they are used to}} improve or to worsen others' feelings. Another key distinction is between <b>strategies</b> <b>that</b> engage a person in the specific situation that has caused the emotion (e.g., trying to get the person to see a situation in a different light) and those that divert attention away (e.g., joking with the person).|$|R

5|$|Kenny Bräck won {{the pole}} {{position}} and maintained his advantage {{heading into the}} first lap. He led {{for a total of}} 134 laps, more than any other competitor. Franchitti employed a <b>strategy</b> <b>that</b> enabled him to drive in clean air while other drivers made pit stops. Bräck reclaimed the lead for the lap-163 restart, but lost it six laps later when a crew member dropped a wheel nut which cost him time. Franchitti took over the lead and held it {{for the remainder of the}} event to clinch the victory. It was Franchitti's third win of the season, his first on an oval track, and the tenth (and final) of his CART career. There were five cautions and nine lead changes during the course of the race.|$|E
5|$|One <b>strategy</b> <b>that</b> {{received}} increasing {{consideration in}} NSC meetingsas {{well as at}} the US Embassy, Saigon and in Congresswas a suspension of non-military aid to Diệm. After the erroneous Voice of America broadcast on August 26, which announced an aid suspension, Lodge was given the discretion on August 29 to suspend aid if it would facilitate a coup. In the meantime, the US Senate began to pressure the administration to take action against Diệm. Hilsman was lobbied by the Senate Subcommittee on the Far East. Senator Frank Church informed the administration of his intention to introduce a resolution condemning Diệm's anti-Buddhist repression and calling for the termination of aid unless religious equality was instituted. This resulted in Church agreeing to temporarily delay the introduction of the bill to avoid embarrassing the administration.|$|E
5|$|Poisonous species {{often use}} bright {{colouring}} to warn potential predators of their toxicity. These warning colours {{tend to be}} red or yellow combined with black, with the fire salamander (Salamandra salamandra) being an example. Once a predator has sampled one of these, {{it is likely to}} remember the colouration next time it encounters a similar animal. In some species, such as the fire-bellied toad (Bombina spp.), the warning colouration is on the belly and these animals adopt a defensive pose when attacked, exhibiting their bright colours to the predator. The frog Allobates zaparo is not poisonous, but mimics the appearance of other toxic species in its locality, a <b>strategy</b> <b>that</b> may deceive predators.|$|E

5|$|President Richard Nixon {{reestablished}} the AMSA {{program after}} taking office, keeping with his administration's flexible response <b>strategy</b> <b>that</b> required {{a broad range}} of options short of general nuclear war. Nixon's Secretary of Defense, Melvin Laird, reviewed the programs and decided to lower the numbers of FB-111s, since they lacked the desired range, and recommended that the AMSA design studies be accelerated. In April 1969, the program officially became the B-1A. This was the first entry in the new bomber designation series, first created in 1962. The Air Force issued a request for proposals in November 1969.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{interference}} is {{an important}} innate defence against viruses. Many viruses have a replication <b>strategy</b> <b>that</b> involves double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). When such a virus infects a cell, it releases its RNA molecule or molecules, which immediately bind to a protein complex called a dicer that cuts the RNA into smaller pieces. A biochemical pathway – the RISC complex, is activated, which ensures cell survival by degrading the viral mRNA. Rotaviruses have evolved to avoid this defence mechanism by not uncoating fully inside the cell, and releasing newly produced mRNA through pores in the particle's inner capsid. Their genomic dsRNA remains protected inside {{the core of the}} virion.|$|E
5|$|Shoup's {{opposition}} to the war only increased over time; he initially pushed for a negotiated settlement but later supported a unilateral pullout from the country. As the Vietnamization strategy took effect and the U.S. increased its air operations, he remained opposed to any <b>strategy</b> <b>that</b> risked a nuclear war with China or the Soviet Union. His criticism attracted more press as the war became a stalemate. It also became highly publicized through discourse among the anti-war movement.|$|E

5|$|Steve Prefontaine {{arrived on}} campus in 1969 and immediately, head coach Bowerman and {{assistant}} coach Bill Dellinger had their hands full {{to rein in}} the rebellious new athlete. The bold running style of Prefontaine, front-running, was a <b>strategy</b> <b>that</b> altered the pace of the sport. At one point, Prefontaine held every American distance record above the 2,000 meters and was thought of by many {{to be one of the}} greatest American runners in history. Prefontaine had never lost a race longer than a mile during his collegiate career and won a total of seven NCAA championships in track and field and cross country. He raced in the 5000m at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, placing fourth in the race. He died in an automobile accident in Eugene in 1975, at the peak of his career.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{mention of}} Seibal in hieroglyphic inscriptions is on Stela15 at Dos Pilas, dated to 13 October 721, and refers to Seibal {{becoming involved in}} the long-running war between the great cities of Tikal and Calakmul and their respective allies and vassals. Dos Pilas was a newly founded city in the Petexbatún region, established by Tikal to exert its control over the Pasión River, a <b>strategy</b> <b>that</b> backfired when Calakmul seized control of the fledgling kingdom.|$|E
