40|$|Abstract:- Modern power {{electronic}} equipment (inverters, converters, switching mode amplifiers, etc.) mostly {{are based on}} switching technique realized by MOSFETs or IGBTs. The requirement of higher output signal quality, reduced size and weight as well as improved power density forces the design engineer to increase the switching frequency into the range of up to several hundred kilohertz, which only can be realized using optimized MOSFET topologies. Nevertheless, all these solutions deal with the disadvantage of the ‘weak ’ body diode of these components. To overcome this drawback, several solutions have been presented in the past. In this paper a novel method is presented which helps to avoid the known disadvantages of the body diode (reverse recovery current, recovery time).
