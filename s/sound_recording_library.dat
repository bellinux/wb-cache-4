40|$|Radio {{broadcasting}} is {{a never-ending}} flow of contents. Information managers {{face up to}} the challenge of choosing which sounds will go to the <b>sound</b> <b>recording</b> <b>library</b> and how to process them. Day-to-day routine shows that there are short-term sounds. Electronic program grids and electronic scripts, created by journalists themselves and with a minimum of documentary standards, are good examples of a quick and effective sound retrieval. These electronic program grids and electronic scripts never replace the Information service, but complete it. Furthermore, related to a new relationship between information managers and journalists, Cadena SER has included a thesaurus in the new edition tool which journalists work with. This novelty allows journalists familiarize with the indexing language of their Information service and a minimum classification in their daily production...|$|E

50|$|The Digital Foley System was {{conceived}} by Bender in 2002 {{as a result}} of his long-standing interest in expanding the art of Foley recording. The DFS system accepts input from the Foley Artist in the form of MIDI triggers, generated using pressure-sensitive foot controllers, integrating industry standard audio post-production tools with a custom software interface. This interface is one of two elements pivotal to the successful implementation of the device. The other element is an extensive <b>sound</b> <b>library,</b> <b>recorded</b> on a Foley stage with multiple shoe types and surfaces.|$|R

5000|$|Musically, Dream, Interrupted {{picks up}} where Charm left off, with the album {{balancing}} a sophisticated yet very distinctly upbeat sound with a somber undertone. Over {{the course of}} the past few years Danny's production style has evolved from sped-up, [...] "chopped" [...] soul samples typical of most of his contemporaries to more ambient, jazz-infused offerings that seem to be a hybrid of drum & bass, bossa nova and electronica. This could be attributed to his recent experimentation with sampling songs from out-of-print foreign film soundtracks, specifically from France, Italy and Japan, as well as <b>sound</b> <b>library</b> <b>records</b> from England. Thus, Danny's musical [...] "evolution" [...] is first documented here on such songs as [...] "Listen", [...] "Twilight Mist" [...] and [...] "Sea of Tomorrow". Occasionally, however, Danny will revert to the sound he first introduced on his earlier work; examples on Dream, Interrupted include [...] "I'm Not Ready", [...] "This Time Around" [...] and [...] "Salon Des Refuses".|$|R
