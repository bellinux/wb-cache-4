40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} the synchronization between heart rate variability and sleep electroencephalogram power spectra and the effect of sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome. METHODS: Heart rate and sleep electroencephalogram signals were recorded in controls and patients with sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome that were matched for age, gender, sleep parameters, and blood pressure. Spectral analysis was applied to electrocardiogram and electroencephalogram sleep recordings to obtain power values every 20 s. Synchronization likelihood was computed between time series of the normalized high frequency spectral component of RR-intervals and all electroencephalographic frequency bands. Detrended fluctuation analysis was applied to the synchronizations in order to qualify their dynamic behaviors. RESULTS: For all sleep bands, the fluctuations of the synchronization between sleep EEG and heart activity appear scale free and the scaling exponent is close to one as for 1 /f noise. We could not detect any effect due to sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: The synchronizations between the high frequency component of heart rate variability and all <b>sleep</b> <b>power</b> bands exhibited robust fluctuations characterized by self-similar temporal behavior of 1 /f noise type. No effects of sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome were observed in these synchronizations. SIGNIFICANCE: Sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome does not affect the interdependence between the high frequency component of heart rate variability and all <b>sleep</b> <b>power</b> bands as measured by synchronization likelihood.

40|$|In {{order to}} test {{predictions}} of the 2 -process model of sleep regulation, the effects of slow wave sleep (SWS) deprivation by acoustic stimulation during {{the first part of}} the sleep period on EEG power density and sleep duration were investigated in 2 experiments. In the first experiment, 8 subjects were deprived of SWS during the first 5 h of a baseline nocturnal sleep period without awakening. Compared to the same interval of undisturbed <b>sleep,</b> <b>power</b> densities in the delta frequencies were attenuated. In the hour following SWS deprivation, power densities in the delta and theta frequencies were considerably enhanced in comparison with the same interval of undisturbed sleep. No change in sleep duration was observed. In the second experiment, 8 subjects were sleep deprived for 1 night and recovery sleep was initiated at 11 a. m. on 2 occasions. In 1 condition subjects were deprived of SWS during the first 3 h of recovery sleep. In the other condition recovery sleep was not experimentally disturbed. During undisturbed recovery <b>sleep,</b> <b>power</b> densities in the delta and theta frequencies were higher than during baseline sleep. During SWS deprivation, power densities in this frequency range were lower than during undisturbed recovery sleep. In the hour following SWS deprivation, power densities were enhanced relative to the same interval of undisturbed recovery sleep. Again, SWS deprivation did not cause an increase of sleep duration. The observed changes in EEG power density support the hypothesis that this EEG parameter reflects the homeostatic process S. The absence of an increase in sleep duration after SWS deprivation, however, contradicts the hypothesized causal role of this process in the regulation of sleep length. ...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD), {{which is}} associated with altered neuroplasticity and increased relative cardiac sympathic activity, enhances the risk of cardiovascular pathologies. Interaction between cardiac sympatho-vagal indexes and delta <b>sleep</b> <b>power</b> is probably altered in MDD. METHOD: Sleep characteristics and cardiac sympatho-vagal indexes of 10 depressive patients were compared to 10 control men across the first three non-rapid eye movement (NREM) -REM cycles. Interaction between normalized high frequency (HF) and delta power bands was studied using coherence analysis. RESULTS: Patients showed increased sleep latency, stage 1 and wake durations. No differences in heart rate variabilities were observed: Total power, HF and RR-interval decreased from NREM to REM sleep and wakefulness in both groups. Gain value was lower in patients while coherence and phase shift were similar between groups. Modifications in HF appear 8 min before modifications in delta. CONCLUSION: Major depressive disorder is related to an altered link between cardiac vagal influence and delta sleep, suggesting disorders in cardiovascular controls and an altered neuroplasticity.

40|$|Interest in {{underwater}} sensor networks {{has increased}} recently {{due to the}} possibility of using autonomous underwater vehicles and sensors to explore the oceans and monitor underwater equipment. Such networks, due to the need for long term deployments, must be energy efficient, like their terrestrial counterparts. However, there are fundamental differences between radio interfaces and acoustic modems, both in terms of achievable performance (e. g. bit rate and latency) and in terms of energy consumption (i. e. transmit power, receive power, <b>sleep</b> <b>power,</b> etc.). These differences may cause techniques that are highly effective for radios to perform poorly in acoustic scenarios. This paper considers asynchronous idle-time power management techniques and the effects of acoustic modem properties on the optimal solutions.

40|$|In this {{longitudinal}} study, {{the sleep}} electroencephalogram (EEG) of healthy infants was quantitatively analysed using power spectral analysis. As EEG is a non-invasive indicator of regional brain activity, the data generated {{from this study}} would provide the opportunity to chart sleep EEG changes of healthy infants in association with brain maturation. Understanding the sleep EEG of healthy infants would also provide a valuable normative dataset {{as a basis for}} association with other developmental measures and discrimination of disease states. A prospective cohort of 34 healthy infants underwent overnight polysomnography (PSG) at 2 weeks, and at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months of age along with Bayley III assessment at 24 months of age. The polysomnograms were scored using the current American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) criteria. Representative epochs of Active Sleep (AS) / Rapid Eye Movement (REM) and Quiet Sleep (QS) / Non-REM (NREM) were selected across the night and analysed using power spectral analysis. The results of the power spectral analysis was binned into the delta (0. 5 – 3. 9 Hz), theta (4 – 7. 9 Hz), alpha (8 – 10. 9 Hz) and beta (11 – 15 Hz) bands and were visually and quantitatively analysed for maturational changes. Then, the correlation between the <b>sleep</b> EEG <b>power</b> spectra of all sleep stages across the age and the Bayley III scores was computed. The Prader Willi Syndrome (PWS) is an interesting disorder to study as infants with PWS are associated with both developmental delays as well as sleep related problems. Similar to healthy infants, the sleep EEG of a retrospective group of 25 infants with PWS was analysed using power spectral analysis at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months of age. The <b>sleep</b> EEG <b>power</b> spectra of infants with PWS were then graphically and statistically compared with healthy infants. The <b>sleep</b> EEG <b>power</b> spectra of healthy infants changed significantly in the different frequency bands as the infants matured. The emergence of a peak in the beta band in NREM N 2 sleep corresponded with the development of sleep spindles. Maturational changes were also seen in the NREM N 3 stage and in the theta and alpha bands in both AS/REM and QS/NREM. These changes are in keeping with maturation and developmental milestones of healthy infants. Three distinctive correlations were observed between the <b>sleep</b> EEG <b>power</b> spectra and development assessment of healthy infants. At 2 weeks old, the QS beta band power has a significant correlation with adaptive behaviour at 24 months of age. The NREM N 3 beta band power at 6 months of age correlated with Bayley III language score at 24 months of age. At 12 months of age, the NREM N 3 delta power correlated with Bayley III motor score at 24 months of age. The correlation analysis from this study indicate that some developmental outcomes in infants may already be programmed as early 2 weeks old, particularly to infants’ adaptive behaviour skill. The <b>sleep</b> EEG <b>power</b> spectra of infants with PWS lacked significant changes across all sleep stages indicating delayed brain maturation. The lack of change in theta band across the sleep stages {{may be related to the}} attention problems associated with infants with PWS. The high power in NREM N 3 delta band in PWS infants may be related to GABAA receptors that are mapped to the affected PWS chromosome 15 region. The differences between the <b>sleep</b> EEG <b>power</b> spectra of infants with PWS and healthy infants may be related to the delayed brain maturation and neurocognitive symptoms of infants with PWS. This study provides an atlas of healthy infant <b>sleep</b> EEG <b>power</b> spectra in the early years of life, providing a basis for association with other developmental measures and a normative dataset on which disease may be discriminated...|$|R

The most energy-efficient models in each office equipment category are eligible for the ENERGY STAR label, which consumers can use to identify and select efficient products. As the efficiency of each category improves over time, the ENERGY STAR criteria need to be revised accordingly. The purpose of this study was to provide reliable data on the energy consumption of the newest personal computers and monitors that the EPA can use to evaluate revisions to current ENERGY STAR criteria as well as to improve the accuracy of ENERGY STAR program savings estimates. We report the results of measuring the power consumption and power management capabilities of a sample of new monitors and computers. These results will be used to improve estimates of program energy savings and carbon emission reductions, and to inform rev isions of the ENERGY STAR criteria for these products. Our sample consists of 35 monitors and 26 computers manufactured between July 2000 and October 2001; it includes cathode ray tube (CRT) and liquid crystal display (LCD) monitors, Macintosh and Intel-architecture computers, desktop and laptop computers, and integrated computer systems, in which power consumption of the computer and monitor cannot be measured separately. For each machine we measured power consumption when off, on, and in each low-power level. We identify trends in and opportunities to reduce power consumption in new personal computers and monitors. Our results include a trend among monitor manufacturers to provide a single very low low-power level, well below the current ENERGY STAR criteria for <b>sleep</b> <b>power</b> consumption. These very low <b>sleep</b> <b>power</b> results mean that energy consumed when monitors are off or in active use has become more important in terms of contribution to the overall unit energy consumption (UEC).
