5000|$|A {{conventional}} buckle that {{is formed}} {{by a male}} buckle member (the hook end) and a female buckle member (the catch end). The male buckle member consists of a center guide rod forwardly extending from the front side with two <b>spring</b> <b>arms</b> equally spaced from the center rod. The two <b>spring</b> <b>arms</b> each have a retaining block that terminates at the front end. The female buckle member has a front open side and two side holes which hold and secure the two <b>spring</b> <b>arms</b> of the male buckle member. This sort of buckle may be found on backpacks, belts, rifle slings, boots, {{and a host of}} other common but overlooked items. It is also known as the [...] "parachute buckle".|$|E

50|$|Thomas Spring Esquire (died 1440) of Lavenham {{was granted}} a {{coat-of-arms}} in the first reign of Henry VI, thus elevating his family {{into the ranks of}} armigerous society. As the family moved from the merchant class to the minor nobility, the coat-of-arms was employed to convey the newly bestowed rank of the family. As such it is prominently displayed, alongside the arms of the Earl of Oxford, over thirty times on Lavenham church. Examples of the <b>Spring</b> <b>arms,</b> often quartered with other local noble families, can be found across Suffolk. The coat-of-arms is now borne by Thomas Spring's descendants.|$|E
5000|$|Occupying 10.5 inches (6U) {{of space}} in a {{standard}} 19-inch rack, the drive was competitive at the time. The cartridge contained a single, 14" [...] aluminum platter coated with iron oxide in an epoxy binder. The two ferrite and ceramic read/write heads were pressed towards the disk by <b>spring</b> <b>arms,</b> floating on an air bearing maintained by {{the rotation of the}} disk. They were positioned by a voice coil actuator using a linear optical encoder for feedback. The track density was 100 tracks-per-inch. The bit density along the track was about 2200 bits-per-inch. Discrete electronics computed the velocity profile for seeks commanded by the controller. An absolute filter (HEPA filter) provided pressurized air to the cartridge, excluding most contaminants that would otherwise cause head crashes.|$|E
50|$|The two {{principal}} donors for church were the 13th Earl of Oxford and the cloth merchant, Thomas Spring of Lavenham. As such, {{the building is}} decorated with the coat-of-arms of the Spring and de Vere families. The <b>Spring</b> <b>arms,</b> {{as well as the}} merchant's mark of Thomas Spring, appears over thirty times on the exterior of the building, while the star of the de Vere family surrounds the top of the tower. A screen in the south aisle was possibly intended as a chantry chapel for the clothier Thomas Spourne, although his remains do not lie here, whilst the parclose screen in the north aisle was to the chantry of the Spring family, later ennobled by Charles I. The remains of Thomas Spring lie in the church and there are several monuments erected to his descendents, such as Francis Spring. North of the chancel is the Branch Chapel dating from around 1500 and south of the chancel is the Spring Chapel dating from around 1525.|$|E

50|$|See drawing, right. The stackfreed {{consists}} of a stiff <b>spring</b> <b>arm</b> (A) with a roller at the end (B) which presses against an eccentric cam (D), usually the roller rides in a groove in the cam's edge. The cam is shaped like a snail. It has a gear on it (E) that is turned by a gear on the mainspring arbor (C), so it makes one turn during the clock's running period. The force of the <b>spring</b> <b>arm</b> against the cam exerts a retarding force on the mainspring, reducing its torque, which varies with {{the thickness of the}} cam. When the mainspring is fully wound up, the arm presses against the wide part of the cam. Since it is far from the axis, the retarding force it exerts is maximum. As the clock runs and the mainspring unwinds, the cam rotates and the spring bears against the narrower parts of the cam, reducing the retarding force gradually, to compensate for the declining force of the mainspring. At the end of the running period there was often a steep depression in the cam that the roller pressed against, so the force of the stackfreed spring aided the weakened mainspring.|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a leaf spring for an electromagnetic actuator and {{to such an}} electromagnetic actuator. The leaf spring {{is formed as a}} whole from a disc of plate-shaped, resilient material. The leaf spring comprises a central fastening part, an outer fastening part extending therearound and at least two leaf <b>spring</b> <b>arms</b> extending between the central and outer fastening part. Viewed from the central fastening part, the leaf <b>spring</b> <b>arms</b> (23) have a first zone (24) originating from the central fastening part (21), in which they extend as far as the outer part (22) but for a first clearance (R). The first zone (24) is followed by a second zone (25) in which, without contacting the outer fastening part (22) and proceeding in tangential direction, they bend back as far as the central fastening part (21) but for a second clearance (T).; A third zone (26) follows the second zone (25), in which the spring leaf arms (23) extend towards the outer fastening part (22) to merge therein...|$|E

40|$|A new {{spring type}} microelectrothermal {{actuator}} with greatly enhanced displacement is proposed. Instead {{of using a}} single long chevron actuator, several chevrons are folded {{into a number of}} sections to become a spring-like actuator. Insulating beams with a very low thermal expansion coefficient are used to form cross-linkages thereby avoiding displacement in the x-direction. As the actuator is heated up under bias, thermal expansion of the material leads to displacement in the y-direction only. FEMLAB simulation shows that for each device, the displacement linearly increases with increasing arm length. By introducing folded arms, the device size is substantially decreased whilst still delivering a large displacement, which is proportional to the number of arms. Hence the displacement that can be achieved by thermal actuation is significantly increased. For instead, the displacement for chevron with l= 400 µm is ~ 17 µm and the size of ~ 800 _ 50 µm. A spring actuator consists of four chevrons with l= 100 um, it delivers a 12. 5 µm displacement with a size of only ~ 220 _ 100 µm. As comparing with a single chevron actuator with l= 100 µm, the folded spring delivers almost 4 times the displacement. A 2 -mask stages process is used to fabricate the device. A freestanding electroplated Ni <b>spring</b> <b>arms</b> without the cross-linkages has already been fabricated...|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} new {{approach}} for designing high-performance microelectromechanical system (MEMS) electromagnetic energy harvesting devices, which can operate at low frequency (<; 1 kHz) over the ultrawide bandwidth of 60 - 80 Hz. The output power from the devices is increased significantly at a low optimized load and this overall enhancement in performances is benchmarked using a "power integral (Pf) " figure-of-merit. The experimental {{results show that the}} efficient nonlinear designs produce large Pf values, giving rise to one of the highest normalized Pf densities among the reported MEMS scale nonlinear energy harvesting devices. This improvement is achieved by suitably designing the nonlinear spring architectures, where the nonlinearity arises from the stretching strain of the specifically designed fixed-fixed configured <b>spring</b> <b>arms</b> under large deflections and gives rise to wideband output response. Different fundamental modes of the mechanical structures are brought relatively close, which further widens the power-frequency response by topologically varying the spring architectures and by realizing the same using the thin silicon-on-insulator substrate using MEMS processing technology. In addition, we have used the magnet as proof mass to increase the output power in contrary to conventional approach of using the coil as the proof mass in micro-electromagnetic energy harvesters. The high performance obtained from the MEMS energy harvesters with integrated double layer micro-coil is compared with the same using wire wound copper coil. The experimentally obtained results are qualitatively explained by using a finite-element analysis of the designed structures...|$|E
