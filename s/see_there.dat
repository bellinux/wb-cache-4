5|$|On 17 November 1184 Coutances was {{translated}} to {{the diocese of}} Rouen, becoming Archbishop of Rouen. The original election to Rouen {{had taken place in}} the summer. King Henry had initially rejected the Rouen cathedral chapter's nominees and put forward three English bishops as the royal candidates. The king also indicated his preference that Coutances be elected, a choice that was confirmed by the pope in November. Coutances hesitated about the translation to Rouen, as the <b>see</b> <b>there</b> was poorer than Lincoln, but as an archbishopric rather than a bishopric it was of a higher status. The medieval chronicler William of Newburgh wrote that eventually Coutances' ambition overcame his greed, and he agreed to the translation. He was received at Rouen on 3 March 1185. Coutances remained in Henry's service however, and continued attend the royal court frequently. During the final 10years of Henry's reign, only Ranulf de Glanville witnessed more royal charters, and only William de Humez, the constable, equalled the 16charters that Coutances witnessed.|$|E

25|$|For ψ to be a wavelet for the {{continuous}} wavelet transform (<b>see</b> <b>there</b> for exact statement), the mother wavelet must satisfy an admissibility criterion (loosely speaking, {{a kind of}} half-differentiability) {{in order to get}} a stably invertible transform.|$|E
25|$|Let X and Y be sets. Then {{apply the}} axiom of {{regularity}} {{to the set}} {X,Y}. We <b>see</b> <b>there</b> must be an element of {X,Y} which is also disjoint from it. It must be either X or Y. By the definition of disjoint then, we must have either Y is not an element of X or vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Dr. John Vertue (1826–1900) was {{appointed}} the first {{bishop of the}} new diocese. He was consecrated by Cardinal Manning on 25 July 1882 and on 10 August of that year opened the Cathedral of St John the Evangelist at Portsmouth. When the new Bishop took possession of his <b>see,</b> <b>there</b> were fifty-five public chapels and forty-nine priests in the diocese.|$|E

25|$|Ekins, the gunner of Sergeant Gordon's Sherman Firefly (called Velikiye Luki, as A Squadron's {{tanks were}} named after {{towns in the}} Soviet Union), had yet to fire his gun in action. With the Tiger tanks in range, the order was given to fire. What {{followed}} was an almost 12-minute battle that saw Ekins destroying all three Tigers that '3 Troop' could <b>see</b> (<b>there</b> were actually seven Tiger tanks in the area heading north, along with some other tanks and self-propelled guns).|$|E
25|$|You will <b>see</b> <b>there</b> the Paysage lacustre, by Le Fauconnier, the Jeune homme et Jeune fille dans le printemps, {{mosaic of}} yellow, green, brown and pink, {{represented}} by small trapezoids of color, juxtaposed, the Paysage and Goûter by Jean Metzinger, classic cubist... A Marine by Lhote {{who invented the}} cubistic water. A figure nue by de la Fresnaye, which seems made with wooden bricks, and a mind-boggling Essai pour trois portraits by Fernand Léger. There too, Gleizes, a Chasse and a Portrait, which I find deeply regrettable, because the author, once, proved he had talent.|$|E
25|$|As a {{consequence}} of the war, the government recalled the silver pengő coins (deadline: 31 January 1942) to prevent personal hoarding. These were replaced by newly designed aluminium coins. Later the cupronickel 10, 20 and 50 fillér coins were recalled as well, moreover, even the bronze 1 and 2 fillér coins disappeared after a time. First, they were replaced by steel, later - {{in the case of the}} 2 fillér - with zinc coins. The war coins were redesigned by Lajos Berán. As the war escalated, none of the above metals was cheap enough to mint coins. The solution was the issuing of low denomination paper money (<b>see</b> <b>there).</b>|$|E

25|$|Over 4000 {{men from}} Burnley {{were killed in}} the First World War, about 15 per cent of the male working-age population. 250 volunteers, known as the Burnley Pals, made up Z Company of 11th Battalion, the East Lancashire Regiment, a {{battalion}} that as a whole became known by the far more famous name of the Accrington Pals. Victoria Crosses were awarded to two soldiers from the town, Hugh Colvin and Thomas Whitham, along with a third to resident (and only son of the chief constable) Alfred Victor Smith. In 1926 a memorial to the fallen was erected in Towneley Park, funded by Caleb Thornber, former mayor and alderman of the borough to ensure the sacrifice of the men lost was commemorated. The local school of art created pages of vellum with the names of the fallen inscribed. These were framed in a rotating carousel in Towneley Hall for visitors to <b>see.</b> <b>There</b> were 2000 names inscribed – less than half the number of actual casualties.|$|E
500|$|Family {{members of}} KAL 007 {{passengers}} later stated that these shoes were worn by {{their loved ones}} for the flight. Sonia Munder had no difficulty recognizing the sneakers of her children, one of Christian age 14 and one of Lisi age 17, by the intricate way her children laced them. Another mother says, [...] "I recognized them just like that. You <b>see,</b> <b>there</b> {{are all kinds of}} inconspicuous marks which strangers do not notice. This is how I recognized them. My daughter loved to wear them." ...|$|E
500|$|Initially {{there was}} {{confusion}} {{as to what}} would happen next. Keith Brown, the race starter, was interviewed briefly by the BBC and alluded {{to the possibility that}} the nine jockeys who noticed and obeyed his recall could be eligible {{to take part in a}} re-run. Several jockeys said that they thought the officials attempting to stop them were actually protestors. Esha Ness's jockey John White said of the latter stages of the race: [...] "I could <b>see</b> <b>there</b> were only a few horses around, but I thought the others had fallen or something." ...|$|E

500|$|Daniel Kalabakov, in {{his review}} for RPGFan, said that while popular opinion of the album was split between those who liked and {{extremely}} disliked the album, he personally [...] "loved" [...] it. [...] He praised it for being an [...] "unorthodox arrangement" [...] and trying something new rather than being merely a piano or orchestral arranged album, the most common types. Chris Greening of Square Enix Music Online had similar feelings about the album, praising {{the wide range of}} styles and sounds and calling it an [...] "unparalleled achievement". Simon of Square Enix Music Online added that it was [...] "refreshing to <b>see</b> <b>there</b> is no compromise" [...] between Kikuta's artistic vision and more traditional commercial styles.|$|E
500|$|In April 2011, Favreau and Roberto Orci {{appeared}} at WonderCon in San Francisco, where they presented nine minutes of film footage and answered {{questions about the}} film. Favreau explained that marketing would show [...] "only a brief glimpse of the aliens of the title" [...] before the film is released. He explained the withholding of certain elements, [...] "I think there are enough visionary people involved with this film {{that there is an}} understanding that there is a personality that the marketing campaign can take on as well as the film itself [...] [...] [...] I {{want to make sure that}} if the audience goes to <b>see</b> , <b>there</b> is going to be a lot of surprises in it that they haven't seen in the marketing materials." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{one last}} {{interview}} with Feletti—who again said almost nothing, citing a sacred oath—Carboni {{informed him that}} so {{far as he could}} <b>see,</b> <b>there</b> was no evidence to support his version of events. Feletti replied: [...] "I commiserate with the Mortara parents for their painful separation from their son, but I hope that the prayers of the innocent soul succeed in having God reunite them all in the Christian religion... As for my punishment, not only do I place myself in the Lord's hands, but I would argue that any government would recognise the legitimacy of my action." [...] The next day Feletti and De Dominicis, the latter of whom had fled to the rump Papal States, were formally charged with the [...] "violent separation of the boy Edgardo Mortara from his own Jewish family".|$|E
