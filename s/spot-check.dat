25|$|All cars, taxis, {{buses and}} trucks {{go through a}} {{preliminary}} security checkpoint before entering the airport compound. Armed guards <b>spot-check</b> the vehicles by looking into cars, taxis and boarding buses, exchanging a few words with the driver and passengers. Armed security personnel stationed at the terminal entrances keep a close watch on those who enter the buildings. If someone arouses their suspicion or looks nervous, they may {{strike up a conversation}} to further assess the person's intent. Plainclothes armed personnel patrol the area outside the building, and hidden surveillance cameras operate at all times. Inside the building, both uniformed and plainclothes security officers are on constant patrol. Departing passengers are personally questioned by security agents even before arriving at the check-in desk. This interview can last as little as a minute, or as long as an hour if a passenger is selected for additional screening. Luggage and body searches may be conducted.|$|E

Hygiene practices also vary from day to day. <b>Spot-checks,</b> an alternative approach for observation, have recently gained increased popularity. In this approach, a list of predetermined conditions is observed at one point in time during a home visit. This paper reviewed experience with <b>spot-checks</b> for measuring hygiene practices and discussed strengths and weaknesses of he approach and its potential usefulness to hose undertaking programmes.

These included the provision of secretarial services and rooms for railway meetings, and meetings between road and rail companies; classification of goods for the setting of rates; the examination and certification of new packaging materials; the registration of rolling stock; the issue of maps and other publications including scales of charges; and the <b>spot-check</b> of wagons and consignments in transit.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the new problem of {{protecting}} volunteer computing systems from malicious volunteers who submit erroneous results by presenting sabotagetolerance mechanisms that work without depending on checksums or cryptographic techniques. We first analyze the traditional technique of voting, and show how it reduces error rates exponentially with redundancy, but requires all {{work to be}} done at least twice, and does not work well when there are many saboteurs. We then present a new technique called <b>spot-checking</b> which reduces the error rate linearly (i. e., inversely) with the amount of {{work to be done}}, while only costing an extra fraction of the original time. We then integrate these mechanisms by presenting the new idea of credibility-based fault-tolerance, which uses probability estimates to efficiently limit and direct the use of redundancy. By using voting and <b>spot-checking</b> together, credibility-based fault-tolerance effectively allows us to exponentially shrink an already linearly-reduced error rate, and thus achieve error rates that are orders-of-magnitude smaller than those offered by voting or <b>spot-checking</b> alone. We validate this new idea with Monte Carlo simulations, and discuss how credibility-based fault tolerance can be used with other mechanisms and in other applications. ...|$|R

However, in subsequence to the ruling it was decided legal for a subject of such a <b>spot-check</b> to compare such policy to that of the SS in public.

40|$|The use of {{programmed}} static <b>spot-checking</b> {{is remarkably}} accurate in detecting {{the presence of}} visual field defects, even the earliest abnormality, provided the correct stimulus (or stimuli) is chosen to check an appropriate number of spots, {{and the location of}} each missed response is retested. Automatic quantitation of visual field defects (so it can later be determined if the defects are worsening) can be accomplished automatically with some of the more expensive new instruments. The less elaborate instruments require repetitive testing or manual interaction, achieving accurate results, but typically with a cumbersome record of the results that is difficult to interpret. An efficient plan for the usual office at present is to use an automated <b>spot-checking</b> instrument for screening and diagnosis, but to depend upon the tangent screen or Goldmann perimeter for quantitation unless the most expensive automated instruments can be afforded...|$|R
50|$|A curfew {{requirement}} {{can require}} that an offender {{will be at}} a fixed address for between 2-12 hours during a 24-hour period {{for up to six}} months. The order can be enforced with electronic tagging. These orders can only be issued if there is monitoring system for curfew in their area. Monitoring can be done via <b>spot-check,</b> with private security firm sending employees to check on an offender at home or but more commonly by electronic tagging. The cost of tagging is estimated to be £675 per month per offender. This compares favourably with keeping an offender in prison which is estimated at £1,555 per offender per month. A 2007 report showed that 58 per cent of offenders broke the terms of their tagging order and more than a quarter committed further offences.|$|E
50|$|To {{compensate}} for variations in urine concentration in <b>spot-check</b> samples, {{it is helpful}} to compare the amount of albumin in the sample against its concentration of creatinine. This is termed the albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) and microalbuminuria is defined as ACR ≥3.5 mg/mmol (female) or ≥2.5 mg/mmol (male), or, with both substances measured by mass, as an ACR between 30 and 300 µg albumin/mg creatinine.For the diagnosis of microalbuminuria, care must be taken when collecting sample for the urine ACR. An early morning sample is preferred. The patient should refrain from heavy exercises 24 hours before the test. A repeat test should be done 3 to 6 months after the first positive test for microalbuminuria. Lastly, the test is inaccurate in a person with {{too much or too little}} muscle mass. This is due to the variation in creatinine level which is produced by the muscle.|$|E
