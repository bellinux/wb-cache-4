50|$|A {{rotating}} {{biological contactor}} or RBC is a biological treatment process used {{in the treatment of}} wastewater following primary treatment. The primary treatment process means protection by removal of grit and sand and course material through a screening process, followed by a removal process of sediment by settling. The RBC process involves allowing the wastewater to come in contact with a biological medium in order to remove pollutants in the wastewater before discharge of the treated wastewater to the environment, usually a body of water (river, lake or ocean). A {{rotating biological contactor}} is a type of <b>secondary</b> (<b>Biological)</b> <b>treatment</b> process. It consists of a series of closely spaced, parallel discs mounted on a rotating shaft which is supported just above the surface of the waste water. Microorganisms grow {{on the surface of the}} discs where biological degradation of the wastewater pollutants takes place.|$|E

The basis of the project was wastewater treatment with an objective of overcoming the shortcomings of the current effluent treatment plant at the industry. The key features of the treatment undertaken were: (i) Breaking of emulsion, neutralization, flocculation and filtration as part of the primary treatment. (ii) A multi-dimensional secondary treatment which encompassed a detailed characterisation before and after the treatment; a comparative analysis of phytoremediation and microalgae technologies.

Tertiary treatment was also significant in the removal process through solids removal. Overall mechanisms of removal were biodegradation and sorption unto sludge biomass. Phytoremediation was also significant in the removal processes. The endocrine disrupting chemicals persisted in the anaerobic sludge digestion process with percentage removals ranging fro 10 - 48 %. Sorption of the endocrine disrupting chemicals onto the sludge increased with increasing values for the partitioning coefficients and the organic carbon contents of the sludge...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{on the impact of}} chemical pollution is now increasingly attracted by the topic of organic micropollutants: as <b>secondary</b> <b>biological</b> <b>treatment</b> of wastewater does not provide the complete elimination of these substances, an advanced treatment downstream the biological process can be implemented. Notwithstanding, the benefits of improved effluent quality can be weakened by the negative effects on air quality, when energy consumption and related pollutants emissions deriving from the advanced treatment technologies are taken into account. It is the aim of this work to present an innovative methodology to judge the environmental compatibility of wastewater treatment processes {{on the basis of the}} damage on human health produced/avoided, expressed as an economic value. In particular, while for air pollution the established external costs were applied, for water pollution the rates of the impacts on human health have been evaluated in terms of Global Burden of Disease and measured in units of DALY (Disability-Adjusted Life Years), then converted into costs based on Gross Domestic Product. As a first application, this procedure was used for assessing environmental compatibility of a final ozonation: the results of this study showed that the reduction of water pollution achieved by means of ozonation might be beneficial for human health at an extent which is in the same order of magnitude of damage caused by air pollution, emphasizing that the question if the use of advanced (energy-intensive) treatments is a proper solution to remove organic micropollutants from wastewater remains still open...|$|E
30|$|It is {{difficult}} to completely degrade wastewater containing refractory pollutants without <b>secondary</b> pollution by <b>biological</b> <b>treatment,</b> as well as physicalâchemical process. Therefore, electrochemical technology has attracted much attention for its environmental compatibility, high removal efficiency, and potential cost effectiveness, especially on the industrial wastewater treatment. An effective bibliometric analysis based on the Science Citation Index Core Collection database was conducted to evaluate electrochemical technology for water and wastewater treatment related research from 1994 to 2013. The amount of publications significantly increased {{in the last two}} decades. Journal of the Electrochemical Society published the most articles in this field with a top h-index of 90, taking 5.8 Â % of all, followed by Electrochimica Acta and Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry. The researchers focused on categories of chemistry, electrochemistry, and materials science. China and Chinese Academy of Sciences were the most productive country and institution, respectively, while the USA, with the most international collaborative articles and highest h-index of 130, was the major collaborator with 15 other countries in top 20 most productive countries. Moreover, based on the analysis of author keywords, title, abstract, and âKeyWords Plusâ, a new method named âword cluster analysisâ was successfully applied to trace the research hotspot. Nowadays, researchers mainly focused on novel anodic electrode, especially on its physiochemical and electrochemical properties.|$|R
