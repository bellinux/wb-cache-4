30|$|The copper {{electroplating}} {{method is}} used to measure cyclic stress that causes metal fatigue [1 – 3]. If copper foil adhered to a machine element is subjected to repeated loads, grain growth occurs in the copper foil. Since the grain growth density {{is controlled by the}} maximum shearing stress and the number of cycles, the maximum shearing stress can be measured based on the grain growth density in the prescribed number of cycles [4]. This method has the advantage of detecting stress in microscopic regions like the stress concentration region.

40|$|AbstractA {{hypothetical}} CO 2 {{storage site}} {{that has some}} abandoned wells located near the injection well is considered. Generally, cement plugs are set to cover or isolate porous or productive formations and to isolate usable groundwater from hydrocarbons. When CO 2 is injected into a reservoir, supercritical CO 2 or dissolved CO 2 spreads out in the reservoir. This dissolved CO 2 can react chemically with cement <b>seals</b> (plugs and <b>casing</b> cement) in abandoned wells. As a result, minerals in the cement <b>seals</b> (plugs and <b>casing</b> cement) may alter to form other minerals or mineral phases. The first simulations concerning migration of supercritical CO 2 and dissolved CO 2 in a saline aquifer and a depleted gas field reservoir, were carried out using TOUGH 2. The following temperatures and depths of reservoir were selected: 50 °C at E. L. - 1, 000 m, 60 °C at E. L. - 1, 500 m and 70 °C at E. L. - 2, 000 m. Secondly, geochemical reactions of cement <b>seals</b> (plugs and <b>casing</b> cement) were simulated. The results of reservoir simulations were used as boundary conditions for the geochemical calculation of cement seals. Geochemical simulation of the reactions yielded the extent (length) of alteration of cement <b>seals</b> (plugs and <b>casing</b> cement) after long time periods; for example, the alteration length of cement seals after 1, 000 years was about one meter.

In this paper, based on the borehole condition and field operation data of this well, the borehole pressure field variation initiated by lost circulation in the low-pressure formation was analyzed {{from the perspective of}} dynamics, then, the variation pattern of differential pressure inside and outside the well bore at different time intervals was depicted, and the primary cause of such complication was theoretically revealed, i. e., the pressure wave generated by instant lost circulation in low-pressure formation would result in redistribution of pressure inside the downhole confined space, and then the crush of casing in the vicinity of local low-pressure areas. Pertinent proposals for avoiding these kinds of engineering complexities were put forward: ① when downhole <b>sealing</b> <b>casing</b> operation is conducted in open hole completion, liner completion or perforated hole, the potential damage of lost circulation to casing should be considered; ② the downhole sealing point and sealing mode should be selected cautiously: the sealing point had better be selected in the section with good cementing quality or as close to the casing shoe as possible, and the sealing mode can be either cement plug or mechanical bridge plug.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{measurements of}} power loss and leakage in a hybrid brush seal (HBS) for increasing pressure differentials {{and over a}} range of rotor speeds. The test HBS, Haynes- 25 bristle pack [~ 850 bristles/cm] and 45 o lay angle, is 166. 4 mm in diameter and integrates 20 -arcuate pads connected with thin EDM-webs to the <b>seal</b> <b>casing.</b> The measured drag power at low rotor speeds (< 11 m/s at 1, 300 rpm) decreases as the pressure differential across the seal increases. At a fixed rotor speed, a significant drop in drag torque (and drag power) ensues as the supply pressure increases, thus demonstrating a gas film separates the rotor from the seal pads. A constant operating temperature (~ 24 oC) at the rotor/seal interface during tests with shaft rotation also indicates the absence of intermittent contact between the seal pads and rotor. Flow rate measurements at room temperature (25 oC) show an improved sealing ability with a leakage reduction of about 36 %, when compared to a 1 st generation shoedbrush seal. The HBS predicted effective clearance (~ 50 ?m) is {{a small fraction of}} that in an equivalent one-tooth labyrinth seal. Identified HBS direct stiffness coefficients decrease (~ 15 %) as function of rotor speed for an increasing supply pressure condition (Pr = 1. 7 and 2. 4). The identified cross-coupled stiffness is at least one or two orders of magnitude smaller than the direct stiffness coefficient. The cross-coupled mass is negligible for all tested rotor speeds and supply pressures. The HBS energy dissipation mechanism is characterized in terms of a loss factor (?) and dry friction coefficient (?). The direct HBS viscous damping coefficient is strongly dependent on the excitation frequency, while showing minimal dependence on rotor speed or supply pressure. The HBS novel configuration incorporates pads contacting on assembly the shaft; and which under rotor spinning; lift off due to the generation of a hydrodynamic pressure. Experimental results obtained show that hybrid brush seals (HBS) are a viable alternative to overcoming the major drawbacks of labyrinth seals; namely excessive leakage and potential for rotordynamic instability. Additionally, during operation a gas film in HBS eliminates rotor and bristle wear, as well as thermal distortions; which are commonly known limitations of conventional brush seals...|$|R
