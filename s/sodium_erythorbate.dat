5000|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>erythorbate</b> is {{produced}} from sugars derived from different sources, such as beets, sugar cane, and corn. An urban myth claims that <b>sodium</b> <b>erythorbate</b> {{is made from}} ground earthworms; however, there is no truth to the myth. [...] It is thought that {{the genesis of the}} legend comes from the similarity of the chemical name to the words earthworm and bait.|$|E
5000|$|In cured meat: Meat {{processed}} by curing contains nitrite {{and has a}} pH of 5 approximately, where almost all nitrite is present as [...] (99%). Cured meat is also added with <b>sodium</b> ascorbate (or <b>erythorbate</b> or vitamin C). As demonstrated by S. Mirvish, ascorbate inhibits nitrosation of amines to nitrosamine, because ascorbate reacts with [...] to form NO. Ascorbate and pH 5 thus favor nitrosylation of heme iron, forming nitrosylheme, a red pigment when included inside myoglobin, and a pink pigment when it has been released by cooking. It participates to the [...] "bacon flavor" [...] of cured meat: nitrosylheme is thus considered {{a benefit for the}} meat industry and for consumers.|$|R
2500|$|Bacon is {{distinguished}} from salt pork and ham by {{differences in the}} brine or dry packing. Bacon brine has added curing ingredients, most notably sodium nitrite, and occasionally potassium nitrate (saltpeter), but <b>sodium</b> ascorbate or <b>erythorbate</b> may also be added to accelerate curing and stabilise colour. Flavourings such as brown sugar or maple syrup are used for some bacon products. Sodium polyphosphates, such as sodium triphosphate, may also be added to make the product easier to slice and to reduce spattering when the bacon is pan-fried. Today, a brine specifically for ham includes {{a large amount of}} sugar. Historically, the terms [...] "ham" [...] and [...] "bacon" [...] referred to different cuts of meat that were brined or packed identically, often together in the same barrel.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>erythorbate</b> is soluble in water. The pH of the aqueous {{solution}} of the sodium salt is between 5 and 6. A 10% solution, made from commercial grade <b>sodium</b> <b>erythorbate,</b> may have a pH of 7.2 to 7.9. In its dry, crystalline state it is nonreactive. But, when in solution with water it readily reacts with atmospheric oxygen and other oxidizing agents {{that makes it a}} valuable antioxidant.|$|E

50|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>erythorbate</b> (C6H7NaO6) is a food {{additive}} used predominantly in meats, poultry, {{and soft}} drinks. Chemically, {{it is the}} sodium salt of erythorbic acid. When used in processed meat such as hot dogs and beef sticks, it increases {{the rate at which}} nitrite reduces to nitric oxide, thus facilitating a faster cure and retaining the pink coloring. As an antioxidant structurally related to vitamin C, it helps improve flavor stability and prevents the formation of carcinogenic nitrosamines. When used as a food additive, its E number is E316. The use of erythorbic acid and <b>sodium</b> <b>erythorbate</b> as a food preservative has increased greatly since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned the use of sulfites as preservatives in foods intended to be eaten fresh (such as ingredients for fresh salads) and as food processors have responded to the fact that some people are allergic to sulfites. It can also be found in bologna, and is occasionally used in beverages, baked goods, and potato salad.|$|E

The research was divided in two parts. The first experiment consisted of potential C. perfringens spore germination and outgrowth in ham containing combinations of NaNO 2 (0, 50, 100, 150 or 200 ppm) and <b>sodium</b> <b>erythorbate</b> (0 or 557 ppm) during cooling. This experiment included {{the evaluation of}} residual nitrite levels as affected by temperature (heat shock at 75 °C for 20 min and subsequent cooling from 54. 4 °C to 4. 4 °C within 15 h), storage time (3 and 24 h at 5 °C) and <b>sodium</b> <b>erythorbate</b> concentration. Inhibition of C. perfringens spore germination and outgrowth was observed after 3 h of ham preparation in all the treatments evaluated. Greater inhibition of C. perfringens was observed with higher concentrations of NaNO 2. Addition of <b>sodium</b> <b>erythorbate</b> resulted in greater C. perfringens populations subsequent to 15 h of abusive cooling. Residual nitrite concentrations were similar under the experimental conditions used in this study. Residual oxygen in the ham could explain the inhibition observed during cooling of the ham within 3 h of preparation. During the second experiment, the effect of NaNO 2 (0 or 100 ppm), NaCl (1 or 2 %) and organic acid salts (Opti. Form PD 4 ®; 0, 1. 5 or 2. 5 %) on C. perfringens spore germination and outgrowth during abusive cooling was evaluated. Incorporation of Opti. Form PD 4 ® (1. 5 %) inhibited C. perfringens spore germination and outgrowth regardless of the cooling rate (9, 15 or 21 h). Addition of NaNO 2 enhanced the antimicrobial activity of organic acid salts. Shorter time period between ham preparation and heat treatment/cooling resulted in greater inhibition of C. perfringens spore germination and outgrowth. Antimicrobial agents should be incorporated into ham formulations in case reductions in NaCl and NaNO 2 concentrations are considered {{in view of the}} recommendation to reduce sodium content in the diet.

40|$|The {{objective}} was to use natural pigments to replace <b>sodium</b> <b>erythorbate</b> (NaEry), a synthetic compound used as an antioxidant in sausage formulations, and to evaluate the oxidative stability of the samples. Six assays were prepared in which <b>sodium</b> <b>erythorbate</b> (ERY) at 0. 05 g/ 100 g was substituted by norbixin (NOR), lycopene (LYC), zeaxanthin (ZEA), beta-carotene (CAR) or dextrose (used as a control (CON)). Physical, chemical, color, texture and sensory parameters were measured {{on the first day}} and after 45 days of storage at 4 degrees C. All pigments used in the sausage formulations were able to maintain the oxidative stability of the sausages (MDA equivalents < 038 mg/kg). Zeaxanthin and norbixin were the most efficient antioxidants of those tested. This antioxidant effect might be associated with the intermediate polarities of these two compounds, which would allow them to concentrate in the membrane lipids or emulsion interface, where lipid oxidation is most prevalent. Other volatile secondary products of oxidation besides MDA should be evaluated in further studies involving natural pigments and sensory oxidative stability. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The techniques used were: Thermal Gravimetric (TG) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analyses, as well as an allusion to a possible protective action of the vegetable oils, based on the thermal oxidation of canola vegetable oil in the laboratory under constant heating at 180 ºC/ 8 hours for 10 days. The studied antioxidants were: ascorbic acid, sorbic acid, citric acid, <b>sodium</b> <b>erythorbate,</b> BHT (3, 5 -di-tert-butyl- 4 -hydroxytoluene), BHA (2, 3 -tert-butyl- 4 -methoxyphenol), TBHQ (tertiary butyl hydroquinone), PG (propyl gallate) - described as antioxidants by ANVISA and the FDA; and also the phytic acid antioxidant and the SAIB (sucrose acetate isobutyrate) additive, which is used in the food industry, in order to test its behavior as an antioxidant in vegetable oil. The following antioxidants: citric acid, <b>sodium</b> <b>erythorbate,</b> BHA, BHT, TBHQ and sorbic acid decompose at temperatures below 180 ºC, and therefore, have little protective action in vegetable oils undergoing frying processes. The antioxidants below: phytic acid, ascorbic acid and PG, are the most resistant and begin their decomposition processes at temperatures between 180 and 200 ºC.

O segundo artigo trata-se da elaboraÃÃo de empanado a partir da CMS de pacu, avaliando os parÃmetros fÃsicos, quÃmicos, sensoriais e microbiolÃgicos nos intervalos de 0, 30, 60, 90 e 120 dias de armazenamento a - 18 ÂC. As amostras da carne mecanicamente separada foram divididas em quatro tratamentos verificando sua estabilidade ao longo dos meses. As anÃlises {{realizadas}} foram a determinaÃÃo de pH, cor valor (L*, a* e b*), capacidade de retenÃÃo de Ãgua (CRA), Ãndice de fragmentaÃÃo miofibrilar (IFM), atividade de Ãgua (Aw) e composiÃÃo centesimal em quatro tratamentos diferentes utilizando 0, 1 % de eritorbato de sÃdio + 0, 5 % de tripolifosfato de sÃdio, 0, 1 % de eritorbato de sÃdio, 0, 5 % de tripolifosfato de sÃdio e sem aditivos. Os empanados foram elaborados segundo formulaÃÃo especÃfica e submetidos Ãs anÃlises microbiolÃgicas, fÃsicas e quÃmicas e sensoriais. Conclui-se que a adiÃÃo de eritorbato de sÃdio elevou de forma significativa a Aw, a CRA e o IFM atÃ o trigÃsimo dia de armazenamento da CMS. A adiÃÃo de tripolifosfato teve influÃncia no valor do pH e na CRA, onde manteve por mais tempo estÃvel o primeiro parÃmetro e reduziu a tendÃncia de queda do valor do segundo. O tempo de armazenamento influenciou de forma diferente os parÃmetros analisados. A Aw e o valor L* sofreram as maiores diminuiÃÃes no inÃcio do armazenamento da CMS, enquanto a CRA e o IFM tiveram a tendÃncia de reduÃÃo contÃnua ao longo do tempo. O emprego combinado de eritorbato e tripolifosfato de sÃdio foi o mais eficiente, pois promoveu o desejÃvel aumento da CRA da CMS enquanto os outros tratamentos apresentaram tendÃncia Ã queda do valor deste parÃmetro. A oxidaÃÃo lipÃdica no empanado de pacu armazenado a - 18 ÂC foi baixa, nÃo indicando nenhuma taxa de rancificaÃÃo no produto. Os resultados da anÃlise microbiolÃgica do empanado de CMS de pacu estÃo nos padrÃes estabelecidos pela legislaÃÃo, isso reflete que a manipulaÃÃo da matÃria prima atÃ o produto final foi realizada de forma adequada para o consumo humano.

The first article was to evaluate the mechanically deboned meat of pacu (CMS) with addition of <b>sodium</b> <b>erythorbate</b> and sodium tripolyphosphate and verifying some of its properties physical and chemical in intervals of 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 days of storage at - 18 ÂC. The second article it is the preparation of breaded from the CMS of pacu, evaluating the parameters physical, chemical, microbiological and sensory in the intervals of 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 days of storage at - 18 ÂC. The samples of mechanically separated meat were divided into four treatments verifying its stability over the months. The data were analyzed to determine pH, color, water-holding capacity (CRA), myofibrillar fragmentation index (IFM), water activity (Aw) and chemical composition in four different treatments using sodium 0. 1 % of erythorbate + 0. 5 % of sodium tripolyphosphate, 0. 1 % of <b>sodium</b> <b>erythorbate,</b> 0. 5 % of sodium tripolyphosphate, and no additives. The breaded were prepared according to specific wording and subject to the microbiological, physical and chemical properties and sensory. It is concluded that addition of <b>sodium</b> <b>erythorbate</b> increased significantly Aw, CRA and the IFM by the thirtieth day of storage. The addition of tripolyphosphate had an influence on pH and CRA which remained stable for longer the first parameter and reduced tendency to decrease the value of the second. The storage time influenced differently the parameters analyzed. The Aw and the L* value decreases suffered the greatest at the beginning of storage, while the IFM and CRA tended to decrease continuously over time. The combined use of <b>sodium</b> <b>erythorbate</b> and sodium tripolyphosphate was the most efficient, since promoted the desirable increase in CRA while other treatments tended to decrease the value of this parameter.

30|$|This study {{proposes a}} {{two-stage}} mixotrophic process for cultivating Chlorella vulgaris. Heterotrophic growth {{is the dominant}} step in Phase I (to increase microalgal biomass) and photoautotrophic growth occurs in Phase II (to improve biomass concentration and lipid production). The {{results show that the}} addition of the low-cost antioxidant <b>sodium</b> <b>erythorbate</b> (8  g L− 1) significantly accelerates the growth of microalgae in the first stage with air aeration. Furthermore, a higher CO 2 fixation rate was obtained in the second stage (at least 344.32  mg CO 2  L− 1 day− 1) with 10 % CO 2 aeration. This approximately corresponds to an increase of 177 % over simple photoautotrophic cultivation with 10 % CO 2 aeration during the whole period. The two-stage cultivation strategy achieved a maximum C. vulgaris biomass concentration of 3.45  g L− 1 and lipid productivity of 43.70  mg L− 1 day− 1, which are 1.85 and 1.64 times those arising due to simple photoautotrophy, respectively. Moreover, an analysis of the product’s fatty acid profile indicates that C. vulgaris might be an ideal candidate for two-stage mixotrophic cultivation of a renewable biomass for use in biodiesel applications. Another interesting point to note from the study is that it is an insufficiency of N and CO 2 that probably limits the further growth of C. vulgaris.|$|E

Isoflavone identification and quantification were performed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Products containing soy and/or soy-based ingredients represent important sources of protein in addition to the low fat amounts. However, a large variation in isoflavone content and in vitro antioxidant capacity was observed. The isoflavone content varied from 2. 4 to 18. 1 mg/ 100 g (FW), and soy kibe and soy sausage presented the highest amounts. Chocolate had the highest antioxidant capacity, but this fact was probably associated with the addition of cocoa liquor, a well-known source of polyphenolics.

30|$|Currently, photoautotrophic {{cultivation}} is {{the most}} commonly-used strategy for cultivating microalgae (as most microalgae are autotrophs). However, some microalgae can grow with organic carbon substances simultaneously. It {{is well known that}} cultivating microalgae in heterotrophic or mixotrophic conditions is an effective way of increasing cell density, as well as lipid content, when organic carbons, e.g. sugars and organic acids, are used as carbon sources (Najafabadi et al. 2015). Studies have shown that some microalgae have higher growth rates and biomass yields (and even lipid content) under mixotrophic compared to photoautotrophic conditions. Bhatnagar et al. (2010) have investigated the mixotrophic cultivation of C. minutissima. They concluded that mixotrophic growth results in the production of 4.43 times more biomass than photoautotrophy if 10  g L− 1 glucose is added. Similarly, the lipid content under mixotrophic conditions was 1.18 times that under photoautotrophic conditions. Liang et al. (2009) studied the growth rate and lipid content of C. vulgaris (UTEX 259) cultivated under mixotrophic conditions and showed that the biomass concentration due to mixotrophic growth reached 1.70  g L− 1. This should be compared to 0.25  g L− 1 produced by photoautotrophic growth with the same concentration of glucose added. Conversely, the lipid content of C. vulgaris in the phototrophy treatment reached up to 38 % compared to 21 % in the mixotrophy treatment. Furthermore, research has revealed that the antioxidant <b>sodium</b> <b>erythorbate</b> (NaE) has a better promotional effect on the growth of Chlorella vulgaris than glucose (Cui et al. 2017).|$|E
40|$|Shelf {{life for}} fresh beef {{trimmings}} is often determined qualitatively based on color, lipid oxidation, microbial growth, and off odors and flavors. The first {{study was conducted}} to determine the number of storage days needed to reach the end of shelf life and to understand the interrelationships of spoilage mechanisms. Beef bottom round flats (Biceps femoris; BF) and chuck clod hearts (Triceps brachii; TB) were sliced to simulate trimmings. Trimmings were stored aerobically, at 5 ?C under fluorescent lighting for 12 days. Objective color, pH, microbial plate counts, and volatile compounds were measured on days 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12. The data showed that 6 storage days is the end of shelf life for color and 9 storage days is the end of shelf life for microbial and organoleptic spoilage. The second {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the efficacy of selected ingredients to extend the shelf life of aerobically stored beef trimmings. USDA select BF and TB were sliced to simulate trimmings and stored aerobically for 6 or 9 days. Samples were treated with ingredients selected to extend shelf life by addressing color, microbial spoilage, or off odor and flavor development. Samples treated with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and <b>sodium</b> <b>erythorbate</b> (NaE) had greater (P 0. 05) were observed in volatile compound groups between treatments. However, beef trimmings treated with sodium bicarbonate (NaB) on storage day 9, had roughly 15 times less aldehydes present than day 9 control samples. Treatment solutions NaE, CPC, and NaB all performed better than other treatments for improving color, and reducing microbial counts and off odor volatiles. These treatment solutions can be used in combination to extend the shelf life of beef trimmings if applied near the end of shelf life...|$|E
40|$|Lipid {{fraction}} {{components of}} meat-based products {{were evaluated by}} analysis of cholesterol, cholesterol oxidation products and fatty acid composition, with emphasis in the trans isomer. 126 samples were analyzed: being 45 of processed beef products, 36 of pork products and 45 of mixed meat products. Cholesterol and cholesterol oxides were determined by HPLC. The fatty acids were determined by gas chromatography using a CP-SIL 88 capillary column. 7 -ketocholesterol (µg g- 1) was found in one sample of hamburger (3. 2), in two samples of frankfurter (1. 6 and 2. 0) and in one sample of mortadella (2. 6). Significant amounts of trans fatty acids were found in two processed beef products. The cholesterol content varied from 220 in the spam to 590 mg kg- 1 in the salami and the total lipid contents from 28 in the ham to 250 g kg- 1 in the salami. The low oxidative degradation of the lipid fraction {{could be attributed to}} the presence of the antioxidant <b>sodium</b> <b>erythorbate</b> in the samples. A fração lipídica de produtos cárneos foi avaliada através das análises de colesterol, óxidos de colesterol e a composição em ácidos graxos, com ênfase nos isômeros trans. Foram analisados 126 amostras, sendo 45 de produtos cárneos bovinos, 36 de produtos cárneos suínos e 45 de produtos cárneos mistos. O colesterol e os óxidos de colesterol foram determinados por HPLC. A composição em ácidos graxos foi determinada por cromatografia gasosa usando coluna capilar CP-SIL 88. O 7 -cetocolesterol (µg g- 1) foi encontrado em uma amostra de hambúrguer (3. 2), em duas amostras de salsichas (1. 6 e 2. 0) e em uma amostra de mortadela (2. 6).

40|$|Polyphenol oxidases are {{important}} enzymes {{because of their}} role in food spoilage, oxidizing monophenols into o-diphenols and/or diphenols into the corresponding o-quinones. The resulting compounds are unstable and can rapidly form brown colored compounds, called melanins. Polyphenol oxidases, (PPOs) have been purified from several sources, particularly from fruits and vegetables. However, successful purification of PPO to homogeneity from plant sources has always been difficult. The purification procedure of PPOs from cassava tuber consisted of (1) the preparation of cassava acetone powder; (2) the buffer extraction of the acetone powder to obtain a crude extract, followed by one of two possible purification procedures. The first consisted of ammonium sulfate fractionation, ion exchange chromatography on Mono-Q and gel filtration on Superdex G 75 to yield two isoenzymes, PPO 1 and PP 02 having molecular weights of 71. 8 +/- 6. 0 and 69. 6 +/- 1. 5 kDa, respectively. The second purification procedure involved hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) on phenyl-sepharose CL- 4 B followed by gel filtration on Superdex G 75 to yield a single active PPO fraction of 68. 3 +/- 2. 8 kDa molecular weight. The two isoenzymes obtained by ion exchange chromatography exhibited pH optima of 6. 5 (PPO 1) and 6. 8 (PPO 2) and were stable in the pH range of 7. 5 to 10. 0. These two isoenzymes had a temperature optimum of 30 [...] 40 °C. PPO 2 retained 65 % of its original activity after heating at 50 °C for 10 min whereas PPO 1 was completely inactivated by the same treatment. The PPO fraction obtained by HIC purification exhibited a pH optimum of 7. 5 with catechol and D,L-dopa as substrates and was stable in the pH range 4 to 8. Its temperature optima, were 20 and 30 °C respectively with D,L-dopa and catechol as substrates and this PPO fraction was able to retain 80 % of its original activity after heating at 50 °C for 10 min. Unstable enzymes were obtained by the ion exchange chromatography purification procedure suggesting that artifacts were created. Kinetic studies performed with the PPO fraction obtained by the HIC purification showed that catechol had the highest catalytic efficiency ratio. The Km values were 28. 1, 5. 27 and 3. 72 mM for catechol, catechin and D,L-dopa, respectively. The PPO from the HIC purification procedure was inhibited by benzoic acid and p-coumaric acid and inactivated by diethyldithiocarbamate but not by EDTA. L-Cysteine, ascorbic acid and its derivatives (erythorbic acid and <b>sodium</b> <b>erythorbate)</b> were also inhibitors of the oxidation of catechol, catechin and D,L-dopa...|$|E
40|$|Antioxidantes sintéticos são atualmente adicionados em salames, porém, devido à maior preocupação dos consumidores com a saúde e a toxicidade destes compostos, os antioxidantes naturais vêm sendo muito estudados. A própolis é um composto que apresenta várias propriedades biológicas, dentre elas a antioxidante. No entanto, devido ao seu sabor forte e dificuldade de solubilização, é pouco empregada em alimentos, sendo que técnicas de microencapsulação têm solucionado este tipo de problema. Assim sendo, o objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a funcionalidade da própolis livre e microencapsulada como antioxidante natural em salame tipo Italiano, verificando também os efeitos desta incorporação sobre as características de qualidade deste produto. Para isso, um ensaio (ensaio 1) com própolis microencapsulada por {{spray drying}} com dois agentes encapsulantes distintos, amido OSA (amido com anidrido octenil succínico) e goma arábica, foram aplicadas em diferentes concentrações em salames e comparadas com uma amostra padrão, isenta de própolis e antioxidante sintético. As amostras de salame adicionadas de 0, 15 % de própolis microencapsulada, tanto com amido OSA como goma arábica, mostraram-se eficientes no controle da oxidação lipídica durante o processo de secagem e maturação dos salames, diferindo consideravelmente do controle. Neste caso, o teor de acidez, cor {{instrumental}} e pH não foram afetados negativamente. Após os ensaios da estabilidade e propriedades das microcápsulas, em conjunto com os resultados do ensaio 1, um segundo ensaio foi realizado (ensaio 2), onde os salames foram divididos nos grupos spray drying e coacervação. A funcionalidade da própolis livre, microencapsulada por spray drying com dois agentes encapsulantes diferentes e por coacervação complexa, foi avaliada comparando-os com salames adicionados de eritorbato de sódio. Nestes ensaios foram verificadas a oxidação lipídica, a cor instrumental, o pH, a atividade de água, a acidez, além da realização de análises microbiológicas e sensoriais nos salames com até 90 dias de armazenamento. Durante o processamento, procedeu-se a análise de perda de peso dos salames para garantir a padronização do processo. Pelos resultados obtidos no ensaio 2, não foi possível diferenciar os tratamentos quanto ao efeito antioxidante da própolis nos salames na medida em que o aumento da oxidação lipídica no decorrer do armazenamento foi baixo, resultado confirmado pela não percepção da rancidez sensorialmente. No entanto, pela análise sensorial verificou-se que os salames com microcápsulas de própolis com amido OSA preparada pela técnica de spray drying foram tão aceitos quanto aqueles com eritorbato de sódio, além de não apresentar resultados negativos na avaliação da qualidade pelas análises propostas. Considerando que estas microcápsulas de própolis já mostraram ação antioxidante em salames no ensaio 1, em próximos estudos seria importante a avaliação da atividade antioxidante da própolis microencapsulada nos salames sob condições críticas de conservação para acelerar a taxa de oxidação lipídica e melhorar a visualização dos efeitos antioxidantes da própolis. Synthetic antioxidants are currently added to salami, {{but due to}} greater concern for consumer health and toxicity of these compounds, natural antioxidants have been more studied. Propolis {{is a compound that}} has several biological properties, among them antioxidant. However, due to its strong flavor and difficulty of solubilization, it is little used in food, and microencapsulation techniques have solved such problems. Therefore, the objective was to evaluate the functionality of free and microencapsulated propolis as natural antioxidant in Italian salami, also verifying the effects of this incorporation on the quality characteristics of this product. For this, a test (test 1) with propolis microencapsulated by spray drying with two different encapsulating agents, OSA starch (starch with octenyl succinic anhydride) and arabic gum were applied at different concentrations in salami and compared with a control sample, free of propolis and synthetic antioxidant. The samples of salami with added 0. 15 % microencapsulated propolis, both with OSA starch and arabic gum, were effective in controlling lipid oxidation during the drying process and the ripening of salami, differing greatly from the control. In this case, the acidity, pH and instrumental color were not affected negatively. After testing the stability and properties of the microcapsules, together with the results of test 1, a second test was performed (test 2), where the sausages were divided into groups spray drying and coacervation. The functionality of free propolis, microencapsulated by spray drying with two different encapsulating agents and by complex coacervation, was evaluated by comparing them with salami added by <b>sodium</b> <b>erythorbate.</b> In these trials were checked lipid oxidation, instrumental color, pH, water activity, acidity, besides conducting the microbiological and sensory analysis in salamis up to 90 days of storage. During processing, weight loss analysis of sausages was carried to ensure standardization of the process. From the results obtained in test 2, was not possible to differentiate the treatments for antioxidant effect of propolis on salami in that the increase in lipid oxidation during storage was low, a result confirmed by no sensory perception of rancidity. However, the sensory analysis {{it was found that the}} salami with microcapsules of propolis with OSA starch prepared by spray drying technique was so widely accepted as those with <b>sodium</b> <b>erythorbate,</b> and no reported negative results in the quality assessment by the proposed analysis. Whereas these microcapsules of propolis have shown antioxidant activity in salami in test 1, in future studies would be important to evaluate the antioxidant activity of propolis microencapsulated in salami under critical conditions of storage for accelerate the rate of lipid oxidation and improve the visualization of the antioxidant effects of propolis...|$|E

A CMS obtida por meio de máquina separadora de carne e ossos foi dividida em quatro tratamentos (CMS lavada com e sem aditivos, e CMS não lavada com e sem aditivos) e mantida sob congelamento a - 18 ºC, por 180 dias. A estabilidade foi avaliada por meio de análises microbiológicas e determinações de nitrogênio não proteico (NNP), bases nitrogenadas voláteis (BNV), substâncias reativas ao ácido tiobarbitúrico (TBARS), pH e drip (perda de água no descongelamento). O processo de lavagem causou redução de aproximadamente 41, 44 e 66 % nos teores de proteína bruta, lipídios e cinzas, respectivamente, reduzindo também os valores iniciais de NNP, BNV e TBARS. Durante o armazenamento, foram observados aumentos (p 0, 05) os teores de TBARS. Os parâmetros microbiológicos avaliados não ultrapassaram os limites permitidos pela legislação. As CMS permaneceram estáveis e em boas condições de utilização, independentemente da inclusão de aditivo, sendo viável sua estocagem a - 18 ºC por 180 dias. This study {{evaluates the}} {{influence}} of washing and adding <b>sodium</b> <b>erythorbate</b> and sodium tripolyphosphate on the stability of minced Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) during 6 months of storage under - 18 ºC. The minced fish was obtained using a meat bone separator and was divided into four treatments (washed minced fish with or without additives and non-washed minced fish with or without additives) and kept at - 18 ºC for 180 days. The stability of the minced fish was evaluated by microbiological analyses and the following parameters non-proteic nitrogen (NNP), total nitrogen volatile bases (BNV), Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances (TBARS), pH, and Drip (loss of water in thaw process) were evaluated. The washing process caused a reduction of approximately 41, 44, and 66 % in total protein, lipid, and ash values, respectively reducing also the initial values of NNP, BNV, and TBARS. During the storage, an increase (p > 0, 05) was observed in the NNP, BNV, and pH values for all treatments, except for the non-washed minced with additives which did not show statistic increase in the NNP and pH values. The use of additives in the minced fish caused a decrease of the drip during the storage, {{but it did not}} affect (p > 0, 05) the TBARS values. Microbiological parameters do not exceed the values allowed by the legislation. the minced fish was maintained at stable and good conditions for use regardless of the addition of additives, so it can be stored for up 180 days at - 18 ºC.

HouserThe {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine the impact of 0 and 20 % dried distillers grains with soluble (DDGS) and increasing levels of glycerol (0, 2. 5 and 5 %) in grow-finishing rations on bacon quality and to determine the relationship between belly firmness and slicing yield for commercially produced bacon. A total of 84 barrows (PIC, initially 31. 03 kg) were fed corn-soybean meal-based diets organized in a 2 x 3 factorial with primary effects of DDGS (0 or 20 %) and glycerol (0, 2. 5, or 5 %) as fed. Belly length was measured from flank end to blade end. Belly thickness was measured at eight locations evenly spaced {{around the perimeter of the}} belly. Belly firmness was measured by centering bellies perpendicularly (skin side up and skin side down) over a stainless steel smokestick and measuring the flex between the edges on the ventral and dorsal edges of the belly. Bellies were injected at 12 % of the skinned belly weight resulting in a final concentration of 1. 74 % salt, 0. 5 % sugar, 0. 3 % sodium phosphate, 120 ppm sodium nitrite, and 500 ppm <b>sodium</b> <b>erythorbate</b> in the bellies. Bellies were cooked to an internal temperature of 53 oC, chilled, pressed and sliced for evaluation. Belly slice yield was calculated by determining the yield of # 1 type bacon slices. Proximate analysis and fatty acid analysis were evaluated by taking every 10 th bacon slice beginning from the caudal end to make a composite sample for each belly. Iodine value was calculated using the resulting fatty acid content results. Twenty bacon slices were removed from the belly one-third the length of the belly from the cranial end for sensory analysis and cooking yields. Sensory characteristics were evaluated on an 8 -point scale for brittleness, bacon flavor intensity, saltiness and off-flavor. There were no significant DDGS x glycerol interactions on any parameters measured (P > 0. 08). Inclusion of 20 % DDGS in pig diets decreased belly firmness (P < 0. 04) as measured by the belly flop fat side down method. Twenty percent DDGS decreased the percentage of myristic acid, palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, vaccenic acid, total saturated fatty acids, and total monounsaturated fatty acids (P < 0. 01). In contrast, 20 % DDGS increased the percentage of linoleic acid, α-linolenic acid, eicosadienoic acid, total polyunsaturated fatty acids and decreased unsaturated: saturated fatty acid ratios, polyunsaturated: saturated fatty acid ratios, and iodine values (P < 0. 01). Statistical correlation analysis of belly processing characteristics showed that by increasing belly weight there will be an increase in smokehouse yields (R = 0. 81), increasing smokehouse yields will increase slice yield (R = 0. 71), increasing belly thickness results in firmer bellies (R = 0. 94) and increasing belly firmness will increase slice yields (R = 0. 60). Fatty acid content did not correlate with any belly processing characteristic (R < 0. 50). Iodine values were highly correlated with Total MUFA (R = 0. 83) Total PUFA (R = 0. 79), Total TFA (R = 0. 75), and UFA: SFA ratio, and PUFA: SFA ratios (R = 0. 83). The inclusion of 0, 2. 5 and 5 % glycerol in swine diets did not affect any measured parameters in this study. In conclusion, feeding DDGS at a level of 20 % decreased belly firmness and changed the fatty acid profile; however, it did not affect belly processing or sensory characteristics. Glycerol fed at 2. 5 or 5. 0 % did not affect belly quality, fatty acid profile, or sensory characteristics of bacon...|$|E
