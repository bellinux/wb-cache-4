5|$|As {{their journey}} continues, the Kushan fleet gives {{sanctuary}} to the Taiidan rebel Captain Elson. With his help, they rally a rebellion {{to distract the}} Taiidan fleets. He aids them in penetrating the Hiigaran system blockade, and in engaging the central Taiidan fleet led by the Taiidan emperor. During the final battle, the emperor manages to knock S'jet into a coma, but the combined Kushan and rebel fleets defeat the Taiidan regardless. The Galactic Council arrives shortly thereafter and confirms the Kushan's claim to Hiigara, a lush world {{in contrast to the}} desert planet of Kharak. When the Kushan make landfall, the awakened Karan insists to be the last one to <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> the planet.|$|E

5|$|On August 29, {{the fleet}} {{transporting}} the two first brigades arrived in Navarino bay, where the joint Franco-Russo-British squadron was berthed. The Egyptian army was concentrated between Navarino and Methoni. Thus, the landing was risky. The fleet sailed toward the Gulf of Koroni {{protected by a}} fortress held by the Ottomans. The expeditionary corps began to disembark without meeting any opposition {{on the evening of}} August 29, finishing on the morning of August 30. A proclamation by governor Capodistria had informed the Greek population of the imminent arrival of a French expedition. The locals rushed up before the troops as soon as they <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> Greek soil and offered them food.|$|E
5|$|Southwest Africa has a {{rich history}} {{encompassing}} colonisation, war and genocide. The first European to <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> Namibian soil was the Portuguese explorer Diogo Cão in 1485. Over the next 500 years, {{the country was}} colonised by the Dutch, English and Germans. Namibia was a German colony (German South-West Africa) from 1884 until its annexation by South Africa during World War I. After the war, it was mandated to South Africa by the League of Nations. After World War II the United Nations (UN) asked South Africa to place Namibia under UN trusteeship, but South Africa refused. Legal arguments continued until 1966 when the UN General Assembly resolved to end the mandate, declaring that henceforth South-West Africa was the direct responsibility of the UN.|$|E
5|$|The {{island was}} first sighted by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen on 21 January 1821 {{and was named}} for Peter I of Russia. Not until 2 February 1929 did anyone <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> the island, when Nils Larsen and Ola Olstad's Second Norvegia Expedition, financed by Lars Christensen, was successful. They claimed it for Norway, who annexed it in 1931 {{and made it a}} {{dependency}} in 1933. The next landing occurred in 1948 and the island has been subject to some scientific research and a limited amount of tourism. The island became subject to the Antarctic Treaty in 1961. Since 1987, there has been an automated meteorological station on the island. Three amateur radio DX-peditions have visited the island and there are sporadic landings by tourists.|$|E

5|$|About 20minutes {{after the}} first step, Aldrin joined Armstrong {{on the surface and}} became the second human to <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> the Moon, and the duo began their tasks of {{investigating}} how easily a person could operate on the lunar surface. Early on, they unveiled a plaque commemorating their flight, and also planted the flag of the United States. The flag used on this mission had a metal rod to hold it horizontal from its pole. Since the rod did not fully extend, and the flag was tightly folded and packed during the journey, the flag ended up with a slightly wavy appearance, as if there were a breeze. Shortly after their flag planting, President Richard Nixon spoke to them by a telephone call from his office. The President spoke for about a minute, after which Armstrong responded for about thirty seconds.|$|E
5|$|Adding to Sparrow's woes, Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) of the East India Trading Company has a {{personal}} score to settle with Sparrow. Beckett wants the chest and forces Will Turner to search for Sparrow and his magic compass. Turner locates Sparrow and his crew on Pelegosto, held captive by cannibals who intend to eat Sparrow. They escape, and voyage to Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris) (a magical woman later revealed to be the Goddess, Calypso, bound in human form as Dalma, and former lover of Jones). Dalma immediately sees destiny in Will, and provides Sparrow with a jar of dirt - Jones can only <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> land once every 10 years, and since land is where Sparrow is safe, Dalma suggests with the dirt that he takes land with him.|$|E
5|$|Born in Oslo in 1864 to a Norwegian {{father and}} an English mother, Carsten Borchgrevink emigrated to Australia in 1888, {{where he worked}} on survey teams in the {{interior}} before accepting a provincial schoolteaching appointment in New South Wales. In 1894 he joined a commercial expedition, led by Henryk Bull in the whaler Antarctic, which penetrated Antarctic waters and reached Cape Adare, the western portal to the Ross Sea. A party including Bull and Borchgrevink briefly landed there and {{claimed to be the}} first men to <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> the Antarctic continent—although the American sealer John Davis believed he had landed on the Antarctic Peninsula in 1821. They also visited Possession Island in the Ross Sea, leaving a message in a tin box as proof of their journey. Borchgrevink was convinced that the Cape Adare location, with its huge penguin rookery providing a ready supply of fresh food and blubber, could serve as a base at which a future expedition could overwinter and subsequently explore the Antarctic interior.|$|E

5|$|Cahill had won {{popular support}} as a {{vigorous}} and impressive minister who had resolved problems with New South Wales' electricity supply {{and in his}} first 10 months as premier had reinvigorated the party. He appeared decisive and brought order to the government's chaotic public works program. In addition, he attacked the increasingly unpopular federal Coalition government of Robert Menzies. All this contributed to Treatt's Coalition being defeated at the 14 February 1953 election, with a total loss of ten seats and a swing against them of 7.2%. Treatt retained his seat with 67.61%. On 3 February 1954, Treatt received, along with Premier Cahill, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia, at Farm Cove, Sydney, {{at the beginning of}} her first visit to Australia and the first occasion on which a reigning monarch had <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> Australian soil.

5|$|During the Nimrod Expedition led by Ernest Shackleton in 1907, parties led by Edgeworth David {{became the}} first to climb Mount Erebus and to reach the South Magnetic Pole. Douglas Mawson, who assumed the {{leadership}} of the Magnetic Pole party on their perilous return, went on to lead several expeditions until retiring in 1931. In addition, Shackleton himself and three other members of his expedition made several firsts in December 1908– February 1909: they were the first humans to traverse the Ross Ice Shelf, the first to traverse the Transantarctic Mountains (via the Beardmore Glacier), and the first to <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> the South Polar Plateau. An expedition led by Norwegian polar explorer Roald Amundsen from the ship Fram {{became the first}} to reach the geographic South Pole on 14 December 1911, using a route from the Bay of Whales and up the Axel Heiberg Glacier. One month later, the doomed Scott Expedition reached the pole.|$|E
5|$|In 1681, King Charles II gave Penn a {{large piece}} of his newly {{acquired}} American land holdings to repay a debt the king owed to Admiral Sir William Penn, Penn's father. This land included present-day Pennsylvania and Delaware, though the claim as written would create a bloody conflict with Maryland (dubbed Cresap's War) over the land grant already owned by Lord Baltimore. Penn put together a colonial expedition and fleet, which set out for America {{in the middle of the}} following summer. Penn, sailing in the vanguard, first <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> American soil at the colony at New Castle, Delaware. An orderly change of government ensued, as was normal in an age used to the privileges and prerogatives of aristocracy and which antedated nationalism: the colonists pledged allegiance to Penn as their new Proprietor. The first Pennsylvania General Assembly was soon held in the colony.|$|E

5|$|The {{plan was}} to stage uprisings {{within a short time}} in {{southern}} and western England, overwhelming Richard's forces. Buckingham would support the rebels by invading from Wales, while Henry came in by sea. Bad timing and weather wrecked the plot. An uprising in Kent started 10days prematurely, alerting Richard to muster the royal army and take steps to put down the insurrections. Richard's spies informed him of Buckingham's activities, and the king's men captured and destroyed the bridges across the River Severn. When Buckingham and his army reached the river, they found it swollen and impossible to cross because of a violent storm that broke on 15 October. Buckingham was trapped and had no safe place to retreat; his Welsh enemies seized his home castle after he had set forth with his army. The duke abandoned his plans and fled to Wem, where he was betrayed by his servant and arrested by Richard's men. On 2 November 1483 he was executed. Henry had attempted a landing on 10 October (or 19 October), but his fleet was scattered by a storm. He reached the coast of England (at either Plymouth or Poole) and a group of soldiers hailed him to come ashore. They were, in fact, Richard's men, prepared to capture Henry once he <b>set</b> <b>foot</b> <b>on</b> English soil. Henry was not deceived and returned to Brittany, abandoning the invasion. Without Buckingham or Henry, the rebellion was easily crushed by Richard.|$|E
