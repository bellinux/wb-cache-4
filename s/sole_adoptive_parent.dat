40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine how <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> related to {{parenting}} and how they related to their children’s biological origin. Issues that were used were how <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> described their own parenting, how they described their own thoughts about their children eventually wanting to search their biological origin and how <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> described the child´s country of birth attitudes towards adoptees wishes to search their biological origin. The method used was qualitative research interviews. The theory that was used for analyzing the collected data was attachment theory. Results from the study showed that the interviewees had different opinions on how <b>adoptive</b> <b>parenting</b> was understood. The varying interview answers from the interviewees show that there is no general picture of what is specific to be an <b>adoptive</b> <b>parent</b> compared to a biological parent. At the same time, the data shows that all interviewees had experienced specific situations about their parenting that distinguishes them as <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents.</b> The results also showed that the <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> are very positive about their children biological origin. Furthermore, results also showed that attitudes towards adoptees wishes to search their biological origin vary depending on the country of birth...|$|R

40|$|Background: Varicose veins (VVs) {{cluster in}} families, but the {{familial}} risk of VVs {{has not been}} determined among adoptees. The aim was to estimate whether the familial transmission of VVs is related to disease in biological and/or <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents.</b> Study Design: The Swedish Multi-Generation Register and the Swedish Patient Register were used to follow all Swedish-born adoptees (born 1932 through 2004) that could be linked to both their biological and their <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> (n = 80, 214; 50 % females). The risk of VVs was estimated in adoptees with at least 1 biological parent with VVs, but no <b>adoptive</b> <b>parent</b> with VVs (n = 187) compared with adoptees without a biological or <b>adoptive</b> <b>parent</b> with VVs (n = 1, 758). The risk of VVs was also determined in adoptees with at least 1 <b>adoptive</b> <b>parent,</b> but no biological parent with VVs (n = 87), and in adoptees with both biological and <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> affected (n = 21). Results: Adoptees from an affected biological <b>parent,</b> but no <b>adoptive</b> <b>parent,</b> {{were more likely to}} have VVs than adoptees from an unaffected biological or <b>adoptive</b> <b>parent</b> (standard incidence ratio [SIR] = 2. 21; 95 % CI, 1. 91 - 2. 55). The familial SIR for adoptees with both an affected biological <b>parent</b> and an <b>adoptive</b> <b>parent</b> was 4. 58 (95 % CI, 2. 83 - 7. 01). Adoptees with an affected <b>adoptive</b> <b>parent</b> but no biological parent were not at increased risk of VVs (SIR = 1. 15; 95 % CI, 0. 92 - 1. 42). Conclusions: These novel findings suggest that genetic factors make a strong contribution to the familial transmission of VVs from parents to offspring, although familial environmental factors might contribute...|$|R

40|$|Adoption {{challenges}} the traditional Western notions of kinship and family formation. Because of this, adoption {{has become a}} stigmatized status in American culture. Utilizing a grounded theoretical approach, this study examines the experiences of stigma by <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> in the United States and the ways <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> react to and manage this stigmatization. Qualitative {{interviews were conducted with}} a diverse sample of 17 <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> living across the country. It was found that <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> experienced stigma through comments made during their interactions with others, which fell into four categories: hesitation toward the birth parents, suspicion of the costs, assumptions concerning adoptive parents’ motives, and reservations questioning the validity of adoption. In reaction, <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> engaged in stigma management strategies to resist and redefine cultural beliefs about adoptive families.

I employ three long-term panel data sets which contain information on {{adopted children}}, their <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents,</b> and their biological parents. In {{at least two of the}} three data sets, the mechanism for assigning children to <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> is fairly random and does not match children to <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> based on health, race, or ability. I find that adoptive parents' education and income have a modest impact on child test scores but a large impact on college attendance, marital status, and earnings. In contrast with existing work on IQ scores, I do not find that the influence of <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> declines with child age. ...|$|R
50|$|Independent {{adoption}} is slightly different {{and a bit}} less bureaucratic. It is not required that the <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> have a pre-placement home study (unless the {{adoption is}} interstate). The {{theory is that the}} birth mother is directly selecting the <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents,</b> rather than relinquishing that decision to an agency. The birth mother (and sometimes the birth father) personally select the <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents,</b> usually by being shown photo-resumes of waiting <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents,</b> then meeting some families in person to select the chosen family. As with agency adoption, a six-month home study follows. In most counties, the home study is done by the California Department of Social Services. In some counties, however, a county office performs the service. Regardless, the home study fee is the same (see below).|$|R

50|$|Many birth {{mothers do}} more than just meet the <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> once before the birth. If they live close enough to each other it is not {{uncommon}} for the birth mother to invite the adoptive mother (or adoptive father too if the birth mother wishes) to come to her doctor appointments. This lets the birth mother see the <b>adoptive</b> <b>parent's</b> joy and anticipation of soon becoming a parent, and allows all parties to the adoption a chance to bond. The same is true at the hospital, where it is not unusual for the <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> to be present for the delivery if that is the birth mother's wish. Many birth mothers ask the hospital staff to hand the baby to the <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> first so they can be the first people to hold their child, before she has even done so.|$|R

40|$|Research {{indicates}} that the transition to adoptive parenthood can be challenging for many <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents,</b> but that the provision of post-placement services may mitigate these challenges. However, {{little is known about}} the specific post-placement service needs of <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> during this transition. This paper describes a pilot project from Ontario, Canada which sought to explore the support needs of <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> in the post-placement period. Eight semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine newly placed <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents.</b> Eight of the nine participants were married; two had adopted internationally, five had adopted through the public system in Ontario and the remaining participant utilized private adoption. Through our analysis of the data, we identified two meta-themes: a) challenges and b) facilitators accompanying the transition to adoptive parenthood. Grounded theory methodology was used to develop these themes into a conceptual framework describing the transition to adoptive parenthood. This framework posits that each parent negotiates a particular set of challenges and facilitators associated with their specific adoption experience. In future, this framework can become a tool to assist <b>adoptive</b> <b>parents</b> and practitioners to proactively identify and address potential challenges during the transition to parenthood.
