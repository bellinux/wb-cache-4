To the ear as to the eye it was a delight, and it was an assured success in the popular affections from the performance of the first piece. For my own part, if one pleasurable sensation, besides that received from Parepa's singing, distinguished itself from the rest, it was that given by the performance of the exquisite Coronation March from Meyerbeer's [...] "Prophet;" [...] but I say this under protest of the pleasure taken in the choral rendering of the [...] "Star-Spangled Banner." [...] Closely allying themselves to these great raptures were the minor joys of wandering freely about from point to point, of receiving fresh sensations from the varying lights and aspects in which the novel scene presented itself with its strange fascinations, and of noting, half consciously, the incessant movement of the crowd as it revealed itself in changing effects of color. Then the gay tumult of the fifteen minutes of intermission between the parts, when all rose with a susurrus of innumerable silks, and the thousands of pretty singers fluttered about, and gossiped tremulously and delightedly over the glory of the performance, revealing themselves as charming feminine personalities, each with her share in the difficulty and the achievement, each with her pique or pride, and each her something to tell her friend of the conduct, agreeable or displeasing, of some particular him! Even the quick dispersion of the mass at the close was a marvel of orderliness and grace, as the melting and <b>separating</b> <b>parts,</b> falling asunder, radiated from the centre, and flowed and rippled rapidly away, and left the great hall empty and bare at last.|$|E

In the algorithms, each data {{point in a}} dataset is considered as a particle which can move at random in space according to the preset rules in the modified model. Further, this data point may be also viewed as a local control subsystem, in which the controller adjusts its transition probability vector {{in terms of the}} feedbacks of all data points, and then its transition direction is identified by an event-generating function. Finally, the positions of all data points are updated. As they move in space, data points collect gradually and some <b>separating</b> <b>parts</b> emerge among them automatically. As a consequence, data points that belong to the same class are located at a same position, whereas those that belong to different classes are away from one another. Moreover, the experimental results have demonstrated that data points in the test datasets are clustered reasonably and efficiently, and the comparison with other algorithms also provides an indication of the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

40|$|Technological {{advances}} {{are increasing}} {{the complexity of}} products, {{especially those in the}} area of information and communication technologies. Complexity has increased in several aspects: An increased number of materials are used in products, small amounts of materials with key functions are included (i. e., rare earths in light-emitting diodes), and there are more combinations of diverse types of components and connections. The difficulty of <b>separating</b> <b>parts</b> of the products limits the development of circular economy strategies where repair, upgrade, and remanufacture prevent wasting valuable resources contained in those products. This article presents a method for analyzing the removal of battery packs in newer portable computer models, namely PC-tablets and subnotebooks, as an example on how the design of batteries can affect the life span and potential reuse of such computers. The study analyzes the difficulty of removing battery packs using the results from previous analyses of the design for disassembly of newer computer models together with audio-visual material available on the Internet. The disassembly tasks for removal of batteries are summarized by disassembly codes {{that could be used to}} help identify the design features that facilitate easier disassembly.

40|$|Three {{models are}} {{evaluated}} for restoring basement rocks coring tectonic windows (Window-Basement) in the Scandinavian Caledonides; parautochthonous (Model I) and allochthonous (models II/III), with initial imbrication of the Window-Basement post-dating or pre-dating, respectively, {{that in the}} external imbricate zone (Lower Allochthon). In Model I, the Window-Basement comes from the eastern margin of the basin now imbricated into the Lower Allochthon, while in models II/III {{it comes from the}} western margin. In Model II, the Window-Basement formed a basement-high between Tonian and Cryogenian sediments imbricated into the Middle and Lower allochthons; in Model III deposition of the Lower Allochthon sediments commenced in Ediacaran times. Balanced cross-sections and branch-line restorations of four transects (Finnmark–Troms, Västerbotten–Nordland, Jämtland–Trøndelag, Telemark–Møre og Romsdal) show similar restored lengths for the models in two transects and longer restorations for models II/III in the other transects. Model I can result in c. 280 km wide gaps in the restored Lower Allochthon, evidence for which is not seen in the sedimentology.

40|$|A {{portfolio}} {{submitted to}} the University of Wolverhampton for the Practitioner Doctorate: Counselling Psychology Award: D. Couns. Psych. This study seeks to qualitatively explore and understand counselling psychologists experience of subjective and objective countertransference within individual therapy and how this affects the counselling process. Historically the available literature suggests {{that the development of}} countertransference has been dominated through theoretical papers rather than empirical research. The complex nature of countertransference amongst practitioners can often cause controversy and debate when it is further broken down into subjective and objective factors. Not only does this impact the therapist, the client and the working alliance, but also the larger systems operating around these variables. This study provides a rich and detailed examination of subjective and objective countertransference through the methodology of Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Six counselling psychologists participated in a face-to-face semi-structured interview revealing countertransference in three parts; subjective, objective and contributory factors giving rise to seven superordinate themes. ‘Subjective’ Super-ordinate revealed ‘Professional, Personal and Reactors’. ‘Objective’ Super-ordinate found ‘Clients life outside the analysis’ and ‘Contributing Factors to Countertransference’ Super-ordinate encapsulated ‘Service restrictions, Therapeutic Relationship and Training’. These findings support several conceptual and theoretical published papers, however this empirical investigation adds to the literature through further informing clinical practice. It does so by <b>separating</b> <b>parts</b> of countertransference, digging deeper into those parts in an isolated way showing the affective processes, techniques, the interplay of evoked feelings to better manage countertransference in the moment of experiencing it and overall how this impacts the therapeutic relationship. Future research could consider exploring how counselling psychologists in the UK focus their attention on distinctive parts of subjective and objective countertransference (subjective countertransference thoughts, subjective countertransference feelings and subjective countertransference behaviours, as well as objective countertransference thoughts, feelings and behaviours separately), further research would also benefit from qualitative investigations of subjective and objective reactions when working with certain populations, for example, diagnosis/symptom-specific individuals, certain demographics and/or investigating couples or family systemic groups and whether this has any impact on the working alliance, therapeutic technique, intervention and outcome. Potential clinical implementation include counselling psychologists becoming better positioned to recognise when subjective and objective countertransference is occurring, {{what to do with it}} through the application of techniques and how to maintain a ‘good enough’ working alliance...|$|E
40|$|Constantly rising {{expectations}} in economy of entire large structures fabrication in shipbuilding industry require a specific {{consideration of the}} individual production areas. In the area of sheet metal cutting, the main goal to increase the economic efficiency {{is to reduce the}} very high post processing time. The key role is played by the clearing and separating of parts and residues after the automatic NC controlled flame cutting. According to {{the current state of the}} art, the process of sorting is manually controlled by an worker. Despite the technical support by crane systems and magnet-traverses, manual sheet metal sorting is highly time consuming. Due to the variety of plates for a ship construction, there is a significant need for a solution with automatic sheet metal sorting. The objective of this research project was to develop one method for the automatic clearing and for the separation of components after the sheet metal cutting process. The NC data of the flame cutting plan on the one hand and the specific requirements of each company on the other, will serve as a basis for this method. For the development of such a method, the State of the art of the process, as well as the available tools was first analyzed. Based on these three concepts for the automatic sorting sheet were developed and examined. A concept, at which small components, less than 17 kg, shall be handled manually, middle size parts with a new flexible magnet-traverse and finally large parts with available big traverses, has prevailed against the other concepts. The traverse, developed in this project, is characterized by the fact that their magnets are individually switchable and additional individually adjustable using linear axes. The identification and localization of the parts are performed through evaluation of cutting and marking data with a software tool developed in the research project. This software controls the complete process of clearing and <b>separating</b> <b>parts</b> and wastes. For the practical proof of the functionality of such a traverse a prototype with two magnets was built up to test the proper functioning of the hardware and software. Based on this test station it could be proven that automatic clearing and separating of components after sheet metal cutting is economically beneficial, to a certain level of automation...|$|E
40|$|Railway {{structures}} represent complex mechanical problems involving wave propagation, plastic deformations {{and material}} degradation. The wheel-rail contact loads subject {{the material to}} repeated cycles of complex stress states resulting in rolling contact fatigue (RCF). A significant problem {{is the development of}} "short" surface cracks called head-checks. These RCF cracks appear on the rail-head and are, typically, close-spaced and (almost) parallel. A parametric study of geometric and material properties that affect the interaction between surface cracks in a model that mimics the wheel-rail situation has been carried out, (Paper A). (Over) simplifying assumptions such as small trains, linear elasticity, plain strain, and Hertzian ressure distribution have been used in this study. In reality, the propagation of RCF cracks takes place under very large local stresses and severe inelastic deformations. An important issue, which is focused in this thesis, is the role of material dissipation for the crack-driving force. Elastic-plastic fracture mechanics accounting for global plastic deformation is still a relatively virgin field. In this thesis the crack-driving force is defined in the context of material (or configurational) forces and computed numerically using finite element analysis. It is proposed that the driving force is defined as the variation of the total dissipation with respect to configurational changes. Material dissipation occurs as result of the configurational changes in addition to the local energy release from the propagating crack tip. As it turns out, the key task is then to compute the sensitivity of the rate of internal variables due to configurational changes, which results in a global tangent problem based on the balance equations. In order to avoid solving this tangent problem, simplifying assumptions in the relation between the rate of spatial deformation and rate of internal variables can be introduced. A few different approaches have been introduced and assessed numerically for a plate with an edge crack, (Paper B). In this investigation, an elastic-plastic material model with isotropic hardening has been used. The development of the crack-driving force for a single crack in a wheel-rail situation has been compared as part of a parameter study, (Paper C). In particular, elastic-plastic material response is compared to purely elastic response. Even in this investigation, simplifying assumptions such as small strains, plain strain and Hertzian pressure distribution are adopted. It is desirable to solve the sensitivity problem without introducing the simplifying assumptions mentioned above. As a first attempt, such an analysis is implemented for quite a simple discrete structure, (Paper D). The approach is extended to the problem of an interface <b>separating</b> <b>parts</b> with dissimilar material properties in a non-homogeneous plate, (Paper E) ...|$|E
