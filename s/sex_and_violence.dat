5|$|A feature-length {{historical}} film Caligula {{was completed}} in 1979, in which Malcolm McDowell played the lead role. The film alienated audiences with explicit <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> <b>violence.</b> Although reviews were overwhelmingly negative (though McDowell's performance as the title character was praised), the film {{is considered to be}} a cult classic.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} version was only moderately successful, {{although it is}} remembered for the first publication of Sturgeon's Law. The publisher, Joseph Ferman (father of Edward Ferman), declared that he wanted well-told stories of action and adventure; the resulting fiction contained more <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> <b>violence</b> than was usual for the science fiction (sf) genre in the late 1950s, and sf historian Mike Ashley {{has suggested that the}} magazine was ahead of its time. It succumbed to poor sales within less than two years. The second US version was no more successful, with less attractive cover art and {{little in the way of}} notable fiction, though it did publish Vonda McIntyre's first story. By the end of 1970, Venture had ceased publication permanently.|$|E

25|$|Maerth {{asserted}} that the eating of brain produces an aphrodisiac effect (presumably due to the vast amount of hormones in it), and that this initially caused apes to become addicted to them, organizing brain hunts wherein the males of another tribe were eaten and the females raped {{in a frenzy of}} brain-induced <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> <b>violence.</b> However, this diet also inadvertently increased brain size and intelligence while triggering the loss both of body hair and of our innate psychic abilities. Thus man gradually came into being, remaining cannibalistic until 50,000 years ago. Modern humans, alienated from their surroundings now that they've no telepathic contact with nature and each other as animals do, suffering from a distorted sexuality resulting from hormonal imbalances, and driven insane from the constant pressure of their unnaturally large brains pressing on the inside of their skulls, are inevitably destroying themselves with pollution, overpopulation, racial integration and ultimately, nuclear war. He foresees a return to cannibalism in the near future, and suggests that the reader should drop out of society, embrace a vegetarian diet, steep himself in the wisdom of the East and perhaps employ various wooden frames and wire devices to alter the shape of his skull as some ancient cultures did, thus relieving the pressure on the brain and partially restoring psychic powers.|$|E

500|$|Bound was {{the first}} film {{directed}} by the Wachowskis, and they took inspiration from Billy Wilder to tell a noir story filled with <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> <b>violence.</b> Financed by Dino De Laurentiis, the film was made on a tight budget {{with the help of}} frugal crew members including cinematographer Bill Pope.

[...] Reports of the trio's deeds and the court proceedings were closely followed and remained prominent in the Singaporean consciousness for several years. [...] Twice, movie companies tried to capitalise on the sensation generated by the murders by producing motion pictures based on the killings; however, critics panned both films for indulging in gratuitous <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> <b>violence,</b> and the movies performed poorly at the box office. [...] The actions and behaviour of the three killers were studied by academics in the criminal psychology field, and the rulings set by the courts became local case studies for diminished responsibility.|$|E
