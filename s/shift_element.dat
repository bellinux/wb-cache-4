40|$|The AC {{electrical}} impedance of frog skin {{was measured in}} the range 1 cycle/second to 50 kc/second by injecting current sinusoidally at low current density. The behavior of the skin {{was found to be}} linear so the usual concepts of impedance could be validly employed. In the range 1 cycle/second to 5 kc/second, the impedance traces out a circular arc locus with its center off the real axis; thus the skin could be represented by a series resistance and a parallel combination of a conductance and a phase <b>shift</b> <b>element.</b> The phase <b>shift</b> <b>element</b> has an impedance angle of about 80 °, current leading voltage, with an equivalent capacitance of about 2 μf/cm 2. The phase shift and the equivalent capacitance were independent of the experimental conditions. The parallel conductance, which was responsible for most of the low frequency impedance, could be subdivided into two approximately equal conductances, one associated with sodium ion current and the other associated with chloride ion current. Both currents were determined mainly by the concentrations of the respective ions bathing the outside of the skin. The response to changes in concentration and the response to CO 2 indicated that the chloride current was passive, but the sodium current appeared {{to be associated with the}} active transport mechanism; little sodium could pass through the skin unless associated with active transport...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{design for a}} quantum key distribution(QKD) system in a Sagnac loop configuration, {{employing}} a novel phase modulation scheme based on frequency shift, and demonstrate stable BB 84 QKD operation with high interference visibility and low quantum bit error rate (QBER). The phase modulation is achieved by sending two light pulses with a fixed time delay (or a fixed optical path delay) through a frequency <b>shift</b> <b>element</b> and by modulating the amount of frequency shift. The relative phase between two light pulses upon leaving the frequency-shift element is determined by both the time delay (or the optical path delay) and the frequency shift, and can therefore be controlled by varying the amount of frequency shift. To demonstrate its operation, we used an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) as the frequency-shift element, and vary the driving frequency of the AOM to encode phase information. The interference visibility for a 40 km and a 10 km fiber loop is 96 % and 99 %, respectively, at single photon level. We ran BB 84 protocol in a 40 -km Sagnac loop setup continuously for one hour and the measured QBER remained within the 2 %~ 5 % range. A further advantage of our scheme is that both phase and amplitude modulation can be achieved simultaneously by frequency and amplitude modulation of the AOM's driving signal, allowing our QKD system the capability of implementing other protocols, such as the decoy-state QKD and the continuous- variable QKD. We also briefly discuss {{a new type of}} Eavesdropping strategy ("phaseremapping" attack) in bidirectional QKD system. Comment: 4 page...|$|E
50|$|A phase {{correcting}} reflective array {{consists of an}} array of phase <b>shifting</b> <b>elements</b> illuminated by a feed placed at the focal point. The word “reflective” refers {{to the fact that}} each phase <b>shifting</b> <b>element</b> reflects back the energy in the incident wave with an appropriate phase shift. The phase <b>shifting</b> <b>elements</b> can be passive or active. Each phase <b>shifting</b> <b>element</b> can be designed to either produce a phase shift which is equal to that required at the element centre, or provide some quantised phase shifting values. Although the former {{does not seem to be}} commercially attractive, the latter proved to be practical antenna configuration. One potential advantage is that such an array can be reconfigured by changing the positions of the elements to produce different radiation patterns. A systematic theory of the phase efficiency of passive {{phase correcting}} array antennas and experimental results on an X-band prototype were reported in 3. In recent years, it became common to call this type of antennas “reflectarrays”.|$|R

Near the solar limb high temporal, spatial (0. 3 ") and spectral resolution observations from the ultraviolet IRIS spectra reveal high-energy limb event brightenings (LEBs) at low chromospheric heights, around 1 Mm above the limb. They {{can be characterized as}} explosive events producing jets. We selected two events showing spectra of a confined eruption just off or near the quiet Sun limb, the jet part showing obvious moving material with short duration large Doppler shifts in three directions identified as macrospicules on slit-jaw (SJ) images in Si IV and He II 304 A. The events are analyzed from a sequence of very close rasters taken near the central meridian and the South pole limb. The processed SJ images and the simultaneously observed fast spectral sequences having large Doppler shifts, with a pair of red <b>shifted</b> <b>elements</b> together with a faster blue <b>shifted</b> <b>element</b> from almost the same position, are analyzed. Shifts correspond to velocities of up to 100 km/s in projection on the plane of the sky. The occurrence of erupting spicules and macrospicules from these regions is noticed from images taken before and after the spectra. The cool low first ionization potential (FIP) element simultaneous line emissions of the MgII h and k resonance lines do not clearly show a similar signature due to optical thickness effects but the Si IV broad-band SJ images do.
