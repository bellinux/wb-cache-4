In this work, we have proposed a framework that can gather the data identified with greenhouse environment and yield status and control the system automatically {{in view of the}} gathered data. By throatily observing periodic conditions, this study has the reason for securing connection between <b>sensors</b> <b>flags</b> and reference estimations. Control programming will give information finding of ongoing show. Through long time running and functional utilizing, the framework has been demonstrated that it has numerous points of interest. To monitor the environment inside greenhouse different parameters have been considered such as light, temperature, humidity, soil moisture etc. using different sensors like DHT 22 temperature and humidity Sensor, LDR, grove-moisture sensor etc. which will be interfaced with microcontroller. It is a closed loop system that will execute control action to adjust temperature, humidity, light intensity and soil moisture if any unwanted errors (high/low) occur...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{method for}} {{detecting}} flaws in automatic, constant-voltage {{gas metal arc}} welding using the process cur-rent and voltage signals was developed. Seven algorithms process the current and voltage signals to give quality para-meters. A defect-detection algorithm processes the quality parameters and flags welds that are different from a base-line. The baseline is constructed from the recorded quality parameters of pre-viously made, defect-free welds. Two se-ries of tests were conducted to test the sensitivity of the algorithms for defects and to test the entire sensor system in production. In the first series, on a 3 -mm lap joint, the algorithms detected a lack of shielding gas, oily parts and melt-through from inadequate part cross sec-tion, but could not detect off-joint weld-ing. The algorithms showed a mixed sensitivity to melt-through from large root openings. In production tests, 520 welds were monitored. The defect de-tection algorithm was tuned on data from the first 82 welds. The <b>sensor</b> <b>flagged</b> five of the six defects monitored and did not flag any defect-free welds. The defect not detected was a small pore, < 3 mm diameter...|$|R
30|$|The smartwatch is a Moto 360 Sport, {{which runs}} on the Android Wear platform. We install an app in this smartwatch to collect its sensor data. When the app {{receives}} a “start” message from the phone, the app starts recording accelerometer and gyroscope readings. During data collection, the sensor data are stored locally. When the app receives a “finish” message, the sensor data are transferred to the phone via Bluetooth. The highest sampling frequency that Moto 360 sport supports is 50  Hz and we specify the <b>SENSOR</b> DELAY FASTEST <b>flag</b> at the <b>sensor</b> listener registration time to achieve this.|$|R
30|$|As {{discussed}} before, the SLP {{is proven}} to be NP-hard. In order to streamline such difficulty (especially in facing with real-sized networks), we adopt an intuitive and heuristic approach based on a popular practice among practitioners known as “select link analysis” or “flow-bundle” [54] in which, traffic volume seen on a road is traced {{back and forth to}} its origins and destinations. In other words, a subset of the OD demand corresponding to the traffic volume of the respective road is first skimmed off and it is then highlighted in the traffic volume plot. By doing so, the trace of the target traffic volume will be shown on the network. The method is carried out in an iterative course. Given a network with the result of the traffic assignment, in each iteration, a road with highest traffic volume is <b>flagged</b> for the <b>sensor.</b> The <b>flagged</b> road is then subjected to the flow-bundle procedure to retrieve the corresponding OD trips, and we call it flagged trips. For the next iteration, the OD demand is first shaken off the flagged trips, and it is then used for a new traffic assignment (better to be called “partial traffic assignment”).|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Various {{sensor network}} {{measurement}} {{studies have reported}} instances of transient faults in sensor readings. In this work, we seek to answer a simple question: How often are such faults observed in real deployments? To do this, we first explore and characterize three qualitatively different classes of fault detection methods. Rule-based methods leverage domain knowledge to develop heuristic rules for detecting and identifying faults. Estimation methods predict “normal ” sensor behavior by leveraging <b>sensor</b> correlation, <b>flagging</b> anomalous <b>sensor</b> readings as faults. Finally, learning-based methods are trained to statistically identify classes of faults. We find that these three classes of methods sit at different points on the accuracy/robustness spectrum. Rule-based methods can be highly accurate, but their accuracy depends critically on the choice of parameters. Learning methods can be cumbersome, but can accurately detect and classify faults. Estimation methods are accurate, but cannot classify faults. We apply these techniques to four real-world sensor data sets and find that the prevalence of faults {{as well as their}} type varies with data sets. All three methods are qualitatively consistent in identifying sensor faults, lending credence to our observations. Our work is a first-step towards automated on-line fault detection and classification. I...|$|R
40|$|Various {{sensor network}} {{measurement}} {{studies have reported}} instances of transient faults in sensor readings. In this work, we seek to answer a simple question: How often are such faults observed in real deployments? We focus on three types of transient faults, caused by faulty sensor readings that appear abnormal. To understand the prevalence of such faults, we first explore and characterize four qualitatively different classes of fault detection methods. Rule-based methods leverage domain knowledge to develop heuristic rules for detecting and identifying faults. Estimation methods predict “normal ” sensor behavior by leveraging <b>sensor</b> correlations, <b>flagging</b> anomalous <b>sensor</b> readings as faults. Time series analysis based methods start with an a priori model for sensor readings. A sensor measurement is compared against its predicted value computed using time series forecasting to determine if it is faulty. Learning-based methods infer {{a model for the}} “normal ” sensor readings using training data, and then statistically detect and identify classes of faults. We find that these four classes of methods sit at different points on the accuracy/robustness spectrum.

40|$|The alkyltransferase-like (ATL) {{proteins}} contain primary sequence motifs resembling {{those found}} in DNA repair O 6 -alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase proteins. However, in the putative active site of ATL proteins, a tryptophan (W 83) residue replaces the cysteine at the known active site of alkyltransferases. The Escherichia coli atl gene was expressed as a fusion protein and purified. Neither ATL nor C 83 or A 83 mutants transferred [3 H] from [3 H]-methylated DNA to themselves, and the levels of O 6 -methyl guanine (O 6 -meG) in substrate DNA were not affected by ATL. However, ATL inhibited the transfer of methyl groups to human alkyltransferase (MGMT). Inhibition was reduced by prolonged incubation {{in the presence of}} MGMT, again suggesting that O 6 -meG in the substrate is not changed by ATL. Gel-shift assays show that ATL binds to short single- or double-stranded oligonucleotides containing O 6 -meG, but not to oligonucleotides containing 8 -oxoguanine, ethenoadenine, 5 -hydroxycytosine or O 4 -methylthymine. There was no evidence of demethylation of O 6 -meG or of glycosylase or endonuclease activity. Overexpression of ATL in E. coli increased, or did not affect, the toxicity of N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine in an alklyltransferase-proficient and -deficient strain, respectively. These results suggest that ATL may act as a damage <b>sensor</b> that <b>flags</b> O 6 -meG and possibly other O 6 -alkylation lesions for processing by other repair pathways...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Electrical Engineering, Washington State UniversityThe {{two main}} {{ideas that are}} {{discussed}} in this dissertation are sparse sensing and actuation in stochastic networks. In the area of sparse sensing, the flag HMM is developed. The flag HMM is comprised of a structured observation process overlying an arbitrary finite-state Markov chain. The observations are such that a subset of states probabilistically emits distinct flags, while the other states are unmeasured. An explicit expression of the probability of error for a maximum likelihood state estimator is developed and {{used as the basis}} for a sensor placement algorithm. This sensor placement algorithm is then tested on randomly generated Markov chains, showing that accurate sensing can be achieved using only a few <b>sensors.</b> The <b>flag</b> HMM is then also used as the basis for sensor selection in a smart home. Many tests are run on a few smart homes, and the results are very {{similar to those of the}} randomly generated Markov chains. In the area of sparse actuation, a dynamic resource allocation (DRA) algorithm is developed for satellite communications based upon a PI controller. The DRA algorithm is designed to also allow for cognitive users. The cognitive users can proactively sense and fill any openings where data is not being sent. Multiple simulations are run with different PI gains as well as with and without the presence of cognitive users. Overall, the DRA algorithm performs well and the cognitive users have little adverse impact on the primary users. Simulations also show that the DRA algorithm performs well in the presence of selfish users and correlated traffic. Washington State University, Electrical Engineerin...|$|R
