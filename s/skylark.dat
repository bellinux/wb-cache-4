5|$|Dave <b>Skylark</b> is {{the host}} of the talk show <b>Skylark</b> Tonight, where he {{interviews}} celebrities about personal topics and gossip. After <b>Skylark</b> and his crew celebrate their 1,000th episode, the show's producer Aaron Rapaport is upset by a producer peer who criticized the show as not being a real news program. A while later Rapaport reveals his concern and urge for change, to which <b>Skylark</b> agrees. <b>Skylark</b> discovers that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is a fan of <b>Skylark</b> Tonight, prompting Rapaport to arrange an interview. Rapaport travels to a place outside Dandong, China to receive instructions from Sook-yin Park, the North Korean chief propagandist, and Rapaport accepts the task of interviewing Kim, on behalf of <b>Skylark.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Skylark</b> {{spends the}} day with Kim by playing basketball, hanging out and partying. Kim persuades <b>Skylark</b> that he is {{misunderstood}} as a cruel dictator and as a failed administrator, and they become friends. At dinner, Koh has a seizure due to the ricin poisoning and accidentally kills Yu before dying. The next morning, <b>Skylark</b> feels guilty and discards one of the ricin strips, then thwarts Rapaport's attempt to poison Kim with the second strip. After another dinner mourning the death of Kim's bodyguards, <b>Skylark</b> witnesses Kim's malicious side as he threatens war with South Korea. <b>Skylark</b> leaves, and after taking a walk, he discovers that a nearby grocery store is merely a façade and realizes that Kim has been lying to him.|$|E

50|$|These <b>skylarks</b> {{frequently}} rocket up {{into the}} sky, fluttering and singing before descending down to earth. Male Oriental <b>skylarks</b> may also hover {{in the air and}} sing, in order to attract a mate.|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time, during {{attempted}} sexual intercourse with Rapaport, who {{still has the}} ricin strip in his hand, Sook-yin reveals that she despises Kim and apologizes for defending the regime. <b>Skylark,</b> Rapaport, and Sook-yin form a plan to break Kim's cult of personality by causing him to cry on air. As they arm themselves for the event, Rapaport and Sook-yin have sex. Before the broadcast starts, Kim presents <b>Skylark</b> with a puppy to keep.|$|E
5|$|The next day, CIA agent Lacey {{shows up}} at <b>Skylark</b> and Rapaport's place, proposing that the duo assassinate Kim using a transdermal strip that will expose Kim to ricin via handshake; they reluctantly agree. <b>Skylark</b> carries the ricin strip hidden inside a pack of gum. Upon their arrival in the presidential palace in Pyongyang, they are {{introduced}} to security officers Koh and Yu; Koh discovers the strip and chews it, believing it to be gum. That night, Lacey airdrops them two more strips from an UAV, {{but in order to}} smuggle it back to their room, Rapaport has to evade a Siberian tiger and then hide the container in his rectum. Later, Kim shows up and introduces himself to <b>Skylark.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Skylarking</b> {{refers to}} the aerial {{displays}} including song made by various species of birds, such as Cassin's sparrow (Peterson 1990). Many <b>skylarking</b> displays are in courtship. Some {{are referred to as}} territorial displays by the male. There are some instances in which birdwatchers claim that <b>skylarking</b> has been used by male birds to avoid predators; the objective being that the predator will mistake the prey for another type of bird and end the pursuit. This survival tactic rarely works.|$|R
5000|$|Makeba {{began her}} {{professional}} musical {{career with the}} South African band the Cuban Brothers, with whom she sang covers of popular American songs. Soon afterward, {{at the age of}} 21, she joined a South African jazz group, the Manhattan Brothers, who sang a mixture of South African songs and pieces from popular African-American groups. She also joined an all-woman group, The <b>Skylarks</b> (previously known as The Sunbeams), singing a blend of jazz and traditional melodies of South Africa. Makeba sang with the <b>Skylarks</b> when the Manhattan Brothers were travelling abroad, though she would eventually travel with them as well. While with the <b>Skylarks</b> Makeba sang alongside Rhodesian-born musician Dorothy Masuka, whose music Makeba had followed, along with that of Dolly Rathebe. Several of the <b>Skylark's</b> pieces from this period became popular, and musical historian Rob Allingham would describe the groups as [...] "real trendsetters, with harmonisation that had never been heard before." [...] Makeba received no royalties from her work with the <b>Skylarks.</b>|$|R

5|$|Ale were {{believed}} {{to be able to make}} men insane; in eastern Serbia there is a special term for such a man: alosan. When people encountered an ala on a road or field, they could get dangerous diseases from her. Ale are also responsible for dogs’ rabies, although indirectly: a <b>skylark</b> that reaches the clouds and encounters an ala there goes mad (alosan), plunges to the ground, and so kills itself; a dog that finds and eats the bird goes mad too.|$|E

5|$|For two years, the Association rented <b>Skylark</b> Ranch Resident Camp in the Santa Cruz Mountains {{from the}} Girl Scouts of Santa Clara County. Over {{the next few}} years, the Association moved the summer program to San Mateo County Council's Camp Cutter in the Santa Cruz Mountains, and later, at {{different}} times, to Marin Council's Camp Marin-Sierra and Yosemite Council's Camp Mensinger in the California Sierra Nevada. They began to attract most youth attendees from the San Francisco Bay Area. In 2014, the Association secured use of Camp Robert L. Cole in the Tahoe National Forest near Cisco Grove, California.|$|E
5|$|Many long-distance {{migrants}} {{appear to}} be genetically programmed to respond to changing day length. Species that move short distances, however, may not need such a timing mechanism, instead moving in response to local weather conditions. Thus mountain and moorland breeders, such as wallcreeper Tichodroma muraria and white-throated dipper Cinclus cinclus, may move only altitudinally to escape the cold higher ground. Other species such as merlin Falco columbarius and Eurasian <b>skylark</b> Alauda arvensis move further, to the coast or towards the south. Species like the chaffinch are much less migratory in Britain than those of continental Europe, mostly not moving more than 5km in their lives.|$|E
5|$|Opportunistic {{and highly}} adaptable, the western jackdaw varies its diet {{markedly}} depending on available food sources. They {{have been recorded}} taking eggs and nestlings from the nests of the <b>skylark</b> (Alauda arvensis), Manx shearwater (Puffinus puffinus), razorbill (Alca torda), common murre (Uria aalge), grey heron (Ardea cinerea), rock pigeon (Columba livia), and Eurasian collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto). A field study of a large city dump {{on the outskirts of}} León in northwestern Spain showed that western jackdaws forage there in the early morning and at dusk, and engage in some degree of kleptoparasitism. The saker falcon (Falco cherrug) has been reported stealing food from western jackdaws on powerlines in Vojvodina in Serbia.|$|E

5|$|The elder Roddenberry {{became a}} patrolman, and held that rank {{for the next}} twenty years. The family {{expanded}} {{with the birth of}} Robert Leon Roddenberry in 1924, and Doris Willodean Roddenberry in 1925. During this time, the Roddenberrys bought their first home at 3243 Drew Street. During Gene's early years, he was saved by a quick thinking milkman who noticed that the house was on fire. He pounded on the door until Glen awoke and rushed out of the house with the children in tow. Roddenberry's father kept rabbits, and the children sold them outside the house. It was these animals that became the subject of Roddenberry's first published work in his school's twice-yearly newspaper, The Ace. During his childhood, Roddenberry was interested in reading, especially pulp magazines, and was a fan of stories such as John Carter of Mars, Tarzan, and the <b>Skylark</b> series by E. E. Smith.|$|E
5|$|The {{plants and}} animals which live on Solsbury Hill reflect the habitat {{provided}} by grassland overlying the limestone rock beneath. Specialist {{plants and animals}}, {{some of which are}} rare species, have adapted to the calcareous grassland. Most of the landscape is largely unaffected by agriculture as shown by the yellow meadow ant. Examples of plant species found include bird's foot trefoil, vetches, greater knapweed, harebells, yarrow (Achillea millefolium), and scabious. It is {{one of a series of}} flower-rich habitats, which Avon Wildlife Trust are trying to link together. The plants attract a range of insects including: the six-spotted burnet moth, hummingbird hawk-moth and a number of butterflies including chalkhill blues. A small population of common buzzard (Buteo buteo) nest in the area. Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), badger and red fox are also seen. The <b>skylark</b> also nests on the hill.|$|E

5|$|They {{set out on}} {{the road}} with little money in a yellow 1973 Buick <b>Skylark</b> {{convertible}} with a guy named Ben (Anson Mount). Lucy, however, leaves without the permission of her overbearing father Pete (Dan Aykroyd), who wakes up the next day to find his daughter is gone. Shortly into their journey, the car breaks down. They realise that they don't have enough money between them for the travel or the repair costs. Mimi then suggests that she sing karaoke at a local bar, where good singers are tipped well by the customers. While at the bar, the girls dress up and go the stage to perform. However, when the song starts Mimi develops stage fright, being unable to sing. Seeing that they needed the money, Lucy takes her place, and quickly becomes a hit with the crowd. They make enough money to fix the car and continue on their way.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the tree}} sparrow has been {{expanding}} its range in Fennoscandia and eastern Europe, populations have been declining {{in much of}} western Europe, a trend reflected in other farmland birds such as the <b>skylark,</b> corn bunting and northern lapwing. From 1980 to 2003, common farmland bird numbers fell by 28%. The collapse in populations {{seems to have been}} particularly severe in Great Britain, where there was a 95% decline between 1970 and 1998, and Ireland, which had only 1,000–1,500 pairs in the late 1990s. In the British Isles, such declines may be due to natural fluctuations, to which tree sparrows are known to be prone. Breeding performance has improved substantially as population sizes have decreased, suggesting that decreases in productivity were not responsible for the decline and that survival was the critical factor. The large decline in tree sparrow numbers is probably the result of agricultural intensification and specialisation, particularly the increased use of herbicides and a trend towards autumn-sown crops (at the expense of spring-sown crops that produce stubble fields in winter). The change from mixed to specialised farming and the increased use of insecticides has reduced the amount of insect food available for nestlings.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Army is {{primarily}} a light infantry force with equipment which may be carried by individual soldiers. It is also equipped with armoured vehicles and artillery; the Army is introducing more armoured vehicles into service {{as part of the}} 'hardened and networked army' initiative.
