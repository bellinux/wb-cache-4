25|$|The final {{orders for}} the strike were issued at 17:30 hrs on Friday 3 December 1971. The first {{formations}} were in flight and heading for their targets by 17:40 hrs. Officially, it was announced via government channels that the airstrikes were launched in response to attacks along the western border on Pakistan Rangers' outposts by regular troops of the Indian army, which the Indian Air Force was providing support to. The Indians would later deny any engagement on the Western Front. However, the Indian air defence radars failed to detect the approaching formations. The first indications for the Indians of the impending assault was {{the roar of the}} strike aircraft over their airfields, while in Delhi, the air-raid sirens were the first indications for newsmen, gathered for the daily brief of the East-Pakistan situation, that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on.|$|E
500|$|The quarterfinal {{match between}} the U.S. and Brazil was sent into a penalty {{shoot-out}} after U.S. forward Abby Wambach tied {{the game at}} 2–2 in stoppage time {{at the end of}} extra-time. Solo saved the third Brazil penalty kick by Daiane, helping the U.S. secure a semifinal spot against France. After the quarterfinal victory, Solo commented on the performance and spirit of the U.S. players during the match, [...] "Even when we were a player down and a goal behind in extra time, you sensed that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to happen", and added that [...] " [...] team kept fighting. You can't teach that. It's a feeling – and we play with that feeling." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the weeks}} after the forfeit, Rainmen guard Joey Haywood recounted that the team had been {{approached}} by an unknown man at their hotel following the brawl. Haywood said, [...] "He was pacing around the lobby on his phone eyeing us. He {{then went to the}} ATM but didn't actually do anything. He went and sat in a parked car out front. We thought <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to go down, like he was scouting us out." [...] The Rainmen promptly left on the team bus, and it was considered a motive for forfeiting the game. On the morning of May 2, two days after the brawl, Rainmen guard Forrest Fisher wrote on Twitter that he had been kicked out of his apartment without warning. He said, [...] "We were in Toronto Friday morning, and I get a message from the landlord at the apartment I stay at, telling me that my bags have been packed and all of my stuff has been moved to storage." [...] The team management, who were responsible for players' living arrangements, were largely blamed for the affair. The players also claimed that they had not been paid in more than two weeks.|$|E

500|$|In 1864 Wagner's {{financial}} position was transformed by his new patron, the 18-year-old King Ludwig II of Bavaria, who paid off the composer's debts and awarded him a generous annual stipend. Ludwig also provided Wagner with a lakeside retreat at Lake Starnberg, and a grand house in Munich. [...] At Wagner's instigation, von Bülow accepted a post as Ludwig's [...] "royal pianist"; he and Cosima moved to Munich, {{and took a}} house conveniently close to Wagner's, ostensibly so that Cosima could work as the composer's secretary. From 29 June 1864 Cosima {{spent more than a}} week alone with Wagner at Lake Starnberg, before von Bülow joined them on 7 July. According to Wagner's housekeeper, Anna Mrazek, [...] "it was easy to tell that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on between Frau Cosima and Richard Wagner". [...] Mrazek said that later in the visit von Bülow found his wife in Wagner's bedroom, but nevertheless made no demands for an explanation, either from Wagner or from his wife. Nine months after this visit, on 10 April 1865, Cosima gave birth to a daughter, Isolde. Such was von Bülow's devotion to Wagner that he accepted the child as his own, and registered her as [...] "the legitimate daughter" [...] of Hans and Cosima von Bülow. [...] Wagner attended the Catholic baptism on 24 April. On 10 June 1865, at the Munich Hofoper, von Bülow conducted the premiere of Wagner's Tristan und Isolde.|$|E
2500|$|When Harry Manfredini {{began working}} on the musical score, the {{decision}} was made to only play music when the killer was actually present so as to not [...] "manipulate the audience". Manfredini pointed out the lack of music for certain scenes: [...] "There's a scene where one of the girls... is setting up the archery area... One of the guys shoots an arrow into the target and just misses her. It's a huge scare, but if you notice, there's no music. That was a choice." [...] Manfredini also noted that when <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to happen, the music would cut off so that the audience would relax a bit, and the scare would be that much more effective.|$|E
2500|$|In 1910, {{they settled}} in Burns in an {{engineering}} camp known as the [...] "Boston tents". Mary and Mott had one child, Glen, who learned from his mother {{how to play the}} fiddle starting at a young age. A classically trained violinist with a [...] "love of children and... a deeply democratic view about making music", Dodge began teaching local children how to play string instruments, first in resident tents then in a photography studio. With assistance from parents and a professional flautist from Italy, who taught the children how to play wind instruments and conducted, Dodge assembled a small orchestra. According to former violin student Ruth Saunders, [...] "All of the sighing, tooting and drumming soon made the citizens aware that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on, and due to her powers of persuasion, they found themselves devoting their time, talents, money and children {{to the creation of the}} Sagebrush Orchestra." ...|$|E

2500|$|In early June 1918, O'Keeffe {{moved to}} New York from Texas after Stieglitz promised he would provide {{her with a}} quiet studio where she could paint. Within a month he took {{the first of many}} nude {{photographs}} of her at his family's apartment while his wife Emmy was away, but she returned while their session was still in progress. She had suspected <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on between the two for a while, and told him to stop seeing her or get out. Stieglitz left and immediately found a place in the city where he and O'Keeffe could live together. They slept separately for more than two weeks. By the end of July they were in the same bed together, and by mid-August when they visited Oaklawn [...] "they were like two teenagers in love. Several times a day they would run up the stairs to their bedroom, so eager to make love that they would start taking their clothes off as they ran." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2010, it was {{announced}} that Paul Reubens was working with Judd Apatow on a new Pee-wee Herman feature film set up at Universal Pictures, with Reubens and Paul Rust set to write the script. In an October 2014, interview with Rolling Stone, Reubens gave an update on the status of the film, saying: [...] "It's been months and months of being right {{on the verge of being}} announced…I thought <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to go public yesterday, actually, and that you’d be the first person I’d be talking about this with. But I’m thinking there will be something made public very soon. It's going to get made shortly after the new year. I wish I could tell you about it right now, because…I mean, it's amazing. It's going to be amazing. It think it first got leaked four years ago or so that the movie was going to be made, and ever since then it's just been stalling and stalling. So I'm really ready for this to happen. But I’m not kidding: It's very imminent." ...|$|E
2500|$|The usual {{method of}} {{disposing}} of sand {{from all the}} digging was to scatter it discreetly on the surface. Small pouches made of towels or long underpants were attached inside the prisoners' trousers; as they walked around, the sand could be scattered. Sometimes, they would dump sand into the small gardens {{they were allowed to}} tend. As one prisoner turned the soil, another would release sand while they both appeared to be in conversation. The prisoners wore greatcoats to conceal the bulges from the sand, and were referred to as [...] "penguins" [...] because of their supposed resemblance. In sunny months, sand could be carried outside and scattered in blankets used for sun bathing; more than 200 were used to make an estimated 25,000 trips. The Germans were aware that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on, but failed to discover any of the tunnels until much later. In an attempt to break up any escape attempt, nineteen of the top suspects were transferred without warning to Stalag VIIIC. Of those, only six had actually been involved with tunnel construction.|$|E

2500|$|The {{employees}} of the hotel {{were in the middle}} of a labor dispute with hotel management; negotiations between the hotel and the employees' union, Local 901 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, had begun in October 1986. The union represented 250 out of the hotel's 450 total employees. One of the main issues causing the dispute was an alleged management plan to terminate 60 union members from employment and replace them with non-union employees. In the week the fire took place, there had been three smaller fires at the hotel: one in a linen closet, one in a pile of cardboard boxes, and another in a roll of carpeting. Management had then added thirty more security guards. Tension between management and employees had become so great that desk clerks, taxi drivers, and local food stand employees were advising tourists to stay away from the hotel and its casino. One week after the fire, the Governor of Puerto Rico, Rafael Hernández Colón, stated that, according to preliminary reports, in the days before the fire [...] "information was going around that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to happen".|$|E
2500|$|Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev had {{achieved}} closer relations during Reagan's second term, but Bush was initially skeptical of Soviet intentions. In 1989, {{just after the}} fall of the Berlin Wall, Bush met with Gorbachev in a conference on the Mediterranean island of Malta. The administration had been under intense pressure to meet with the Soviets, but not all initially found the Malta Summit to be a step in the right direction; Scowcroft, among others, was apprehensive about the meeting, saying that it might be [...] "premature" [...] due to concerns where, according to Condoleezza Rice, [...] "expectations [...] set that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to happen, where the Soviets might grandstand and force [...] into agreements that would ultimately not be good for the United States." [...] But European leaders, including François Mitterrand and Margaret Thatcher, encouraged Bush to meet with Gorbachev, something that he did December 2 and 3, 1989. Though no agreements were signed, the meeting was viewed largely as being an important one; when asked about nuclear war, Gorbachev responded, [...] "I assured the President of the United States that the Soviet Union would never start a hot war against the United States of America. And we would like our relations to develop in such a way that they would open greater possibilities for cooperation.... This is just the beginning. We are just at the very beginning of our road, long road to a long-lasting, peaceful period." ...|$|E
