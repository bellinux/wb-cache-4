40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} an atmospheric pressure plasma (APP) pre-treatment on the <b>shrink</b> <b>resistance</b> of wool fabric treated subsequently, by the pad/dry method, with an aqueous emulsion of the amino-functional polydimethylsiloxane, SM 8709. Optimal <b>shrink</b> <b>resistance</b> (with no impairment of fabric handle) was obtained after a low-level plasma treatment (1 - 3 s exposure time), using 5 % of the polymer emulsion. Higher levels of silicone polymer {{could be used to}} achieve <b>shrink</b> <b>resistance</b> {{in the absence of a}} plasma pre-treatment, but the fabric handle would be adversely affected. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies showed that the bulk of the covalently bound surface lipid layer was removed after a plasma exposure time of 30 s. For treatment times of 3 s or less, however, the removal was incomplete, suggesting that optimum <b>shrink</b> <b>resistance</b> (after treatment with the silicone polymer) was associated with the modification of the surface layer rather than its complete destruction. Scanning electron micrographs (SEMs) revealed that the plasma pre-treatment did not lead to any physical modifications (such as smoothening of the scale edges), even for long exposure times, and had no significant impact on the extent or nature of the inter-fibre bonding of the polymer. Confocal microscopy showed uniform spread of polymer on single fibres. It is concluded that the main impact of the plasma pre-treatment was to enhance the distribution of polymer both on and between fibres and to improve adhesion of polymer to the fibre. <br /...|$|R

30|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to develop <b>shrink</b> <b>resistance</b> cotton textile by making it {{hydrophobic}}. The cotton fabric was made hydrophobic by treating with fluorocarbon resin emulsion at varying concentrations along with catalyst. The hydrophobicity was measured by carrying out water repellency test and also determining the water contact angle. The air permeability of cotton fabric was also determined and was not adversely affected. The untreated and treated cotton fabric was subjected to repeated domestic laundry condition and shrinkage was measured. In order to determine the impact of fluorocarbon treatment on fabric, the physical properties of treated and untreated cotton fabrics were compared. No adverse impact was observed in colour fastness properties. The tensile and tear strength showed good retention even at higher concentration of water repellent chemicals. This work finds wide use in home textiles and hotel industry. This work is of industrial interest as value added <b>shrink</b> <b>resistance</b> cotton textiles can fetch more export earnings.|$|R

The capacity of laccase to oxidise NDGA in this aqueous-organic medium has been studied electrochemicaly. The increase of CH 2, CH 3 and aromatic groups signal in the DRIFT spectra, together with SEM images of the enzymatically-modified fabrics confirmed the covalent grafting of NDGA on wool.

40|$|Wool fiber is {{commonly}} used in textile industry, however, it has some technical problems which affect the quality and performance of the finished products such as felting shrinkage, handle, lustre, pilling, and dyeability. These problems may be attributed mainly {{in the presence of}} wool scales on the fiber surface. Recently, chemical treatments such as oxidation and reduction are the commonly used descaling methods in the industry. However, {{as a result of the}} pollution caused by various chemical treatments, physical treatment such as low temperature plasma (LTP) treatment has been introduced recently because it is similarly capable of achieving a comparable descaling effect. Most of the discussions on the applications of LTP treatment on wool fiber were focused on applying this technique for improving the surface wettability and <b>shrink</b> <b>resistance.</b> Meanwhile, little discussion has been made on the mechanical properties, thermal properties, and the air permeability. In this paper, wool fabric was treated with LTP treatment with the use of a non-polymerizing gas, namely oxygen.

40|$|Plasma {{treatment}} {{is based on}} the physico-chemical changes of the material surface and as an ecologically and economically acceptable process it can be an attractive alternative to conventional modifications. The possibilities of plasma technology application to the modification of polymer and textile materials are discussed. Different specific properties of the material can be achieved by plasma cleaning, etching, functionalization or polymerization. The final effects are strongly influenced by the treatment parameters (treatment time, pressure, power, gas flow), the applied gas and nature of the material. The plasma treatment of polymers is predominantly focused on cleaning and activation of the surfaces to increase adhesion, binding, wettability, dye ability and printability. Current studies deal more with plasma polymerization where an ultra thin film of plasma polymer is deposited on the material surface and, depending on the applied monomer, different specific properties can be obtained (i. e. chemical and thermal resistance, abrasion resistance, antireflexion, water repellence, etc.). Plasma application to textiles is mostly oriented toward wool and synthetic fibres, though some studies also consider cotton, hemp, flax and silk. The main goal of plasma {{treatment is}} to impart a more hydrophilic fibre surface and accordingly increase wettability, dye ability, printability and particularly, <b>shrink</b> <b>resistance</b> in the case of wool.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of {{different}} enzymes on wool top. Wool top was incubated with proteases SP 655, SP 656, SP 490 {{as well as with}} lipase SP 398. The changes in wool morphology that occurred {{as a result of the}} enzyme treatment were shown by means of scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. On the basis of the morphological results protease SP 655 was chosen for further experiments to improve the wool properties like handle, dyeing, <b>shrink</b> <b>resistance</b> and whiteness. Wool cortex and cuticle are not significantly changed after treatment with protease SP 655 over a period of 1 h. This was confirmed by gel electrophoresis. By contrast, the densitogram of merino wool treated with protease SP 655 over a period of 6 h, showed no more peaks in the area of the low sulfur proteins with a molecular weight of 45 - 50 kD, but an increase of peak number in the area of the low molecular weight proteins. The handle of merino wool was improved by enzyme treatment with a protease concentration of 0, 2 % over a period of 1 h at 57 °C. Moreover 72 % of the testing persons found that the softness of crossbred wool increased after this enzyme treatment compared to the reference sample. The felting of merino wool top is not reduced by the enzyme treatment described above. The felting of crossbred wool, however, was significantly reduced after enzyme treatment in comparison to the reference fibres and untreated crossbred wool. The <b>shrink</b> <b>resistance</b> of merino wool is significantly improved only after treatment with a protease concentration of 0, 6 %. A further decrease of felting was achieved by enzyme treatment in sodium borate/HCl-buffer. The felt density of the wool fibres treated in borate/HCl-buffer is significantly lower in comparison to the felt density of the wool fibres treated in borate/acetate-buffer. The felting results of merino wool after different treatment times showed that the felt density decreases with treatment time. Non-extracted wool felts significantly more compared to extracted wool top after enzyme treatment. The modification of merino wool fibres is very high after increasing the enzyme concentration and the treatment time. The modification of non-extracted wool top after enzyme treatment is distinctly smaller compared to wool top, which was extracted before. The degree of whiteness of enzyme treated wool top, such as merino and crossbred wool, is generally higher than that of the respective reference samples and of untreated wool top. After enzyme treatment, the whiteness of non-extracted wool top is significantly higher than the whiteness of extracted wool top. A higher protease SP 655 concentration on wool top does not cause a further improvement of the degree of whiteness. The tensile strength of merino and crossbred wool is not influenced by treatment with a protease concentration of 0, 2 owf in borate/acetate buffer. The tensile strength of merino wool decreases significantly after treatment with a protease concentration of 0, 6 owf compared to untreated wool top. The results of a new test method developed for measuring the buckling force of fibre bundles showed that significant differences in the buckling force of wool bundles with varying fibre diameter can be measured. By contrast, the values obtained when using this test method on enzyme-treated wool samples varied widely. Dyeing tests with Lanasol Blue 8 G at 98 °C and 50 °C showed that the enzyme treated wool samples are darker stained in comparison to the reference samples. The dye uptake of the enzyme treated samples is higher and faster than that of the reference samples. Using the dyestuffs Acid Red 88 -II and Food Red 5 with a smaller molecular weight in comparison to Lanasol Blue 8 G no significant difference is found between the dye uptake of the enzyme treated wool fibres and the reference fibres...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the nature}} of {{exothermic}} reaction and high thermal <b>resistance,</b> <b>processing</b> thick-sectioned composites can be very difficult. Instead of expensive and time consuming trial and error methods, pre-catalyzing fabric technique applied to the hand lay-up process is very effective to decrease exothermal peak dramatically. By applying the peroxide catalyst to the fabric, this technique can slow down the polymerization reaction rate and subsequently reduce the internal temperature during curing. In this study, two kinds of pre-catalyzing methods were developed: one used polystyrene as the catalyst binder; another used epoxy resin as the binder. The experimental results indicate that the pre-catalyzing method using polystyrene as the binder can control the peak exothermic temperature to be under 30 { 493 }C, and the method using epoxy binder can limit that temperature to be below 39 { 493 }C.

40|$|Within {{the scope}} of this thesis a {{temperature}} mapping system was developed, capable of measuring the temperature distribution on the outer surface of a single cell 1. 3 Ghz superconducting cavity, immersed in superfluid helium. The system consists of 768 thermometers covering the surface almost equally. A total readout of all thermometers can be achieved in a time t < 40 ms. The resolution of the system is in the order of 2 mK. The temperature mapping system has proven to be an excellent diagnostic tool. Any significant change in the excitation function Q(E) of the cavity (quality factor as function of accelerating gradient) could be associated with a modification in the temperature map. Locally enhanced surface resistance, field emission and thermionic emission are the main loss mechanisms which are limiting the maximum gradient in present-day cavities. The surface heating caused by these loss mechanisms was studied {{as a function of the}} electric field and compared with model calculations. As a result, it was possible to obtain the characteristic parameters of field and thermionic emitters and also the magnitude of the enhanced surface <b>resistance.</b> <b>Processing</b> events, that is erratic change of the Q(E) excitation curve, were found to be associated with the destruction or modification of emitters.

It is found that with increasing device size, the SOA in terms of current density <b>shrinks</b> and thermal <b>resistance</b> per unit area increases, which is demonstrated by both simulation and measurement...|$|R
