When Warren learns Blake is friends with Chris, he decides {{to put a stop}} to the situation. Warren threatens to kill Chris unless he stops {{spending}} time with Blake. Mason told TV Week that he thinks it is a shame Chris and Blake cannot continue their friendship because of Warren and his views. It soon becomes clear someone is spying on Chris, but whether it is Warren or <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> not clear. Mason added something big would happen and it may not end well for Chris.|$|E
5|$|In Sandoz's apartment, Mulder and Scully find {{a picture}} of him with Albert Hosteen; they also find Merkmallen's dismembered body in a trash bag. The agents report to Skinner, with Mulder believing that Sandoz is being framed and that the {{artifact}} emits galactic radiation. He also seems to know that <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> involved on the case, but Skinner remains silent. However, after the agents leave, Skinner hands a video tape of their conversation to Alex Krycek, who later provides it to Barnes. Scully travels to New Mexico and discovers that Hosteen is dying of cancer; Scully runs into Sandoz and corners him. Sandoz claims that Albert was helping him translate the artifacts, which had included passages from the Bible. Meanwhile, Mulder goes to the university to tail Barnes, but is overcome by his headache and passes out in the stairwell.|$|E

Generally, securely attached children {{have been found to be}} more empathetic compared with insecurely attached children. The reasoning suggested for this result is that because securely attached children receive more empathy from caregivers during times that they themselves are distressed, they are more likely to show empathy in a situation where <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> distressed.|$|E

25|$|Formerly, {{scholars}} {{believed that}} the myth of Ishtar's descent took place {{after the death of}} Ishtar's lover Tammuz and that Ishtar had gone to the underworld to rescue him. However, the discovery of a corresponding myth about Inanna, the Sumerian counterpart of Ishtar, has shed some light on the myth of Ishtar's descent, including its somewhat enigmatic ending lines. In the Sumerian version of the story, Inanna can only return from the Underworld if <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> taken there as her replacement. A horde of galla demons follow her out of the Underworld to ensure this. However, each time Inanna runs into someone, she finds him to be a friend and lets him go free. When she finally reaches her home, she finds her husband Dumuzid, the Sumerian equivalent of Tammuz, seated on his throne, not at all grieved by her death. In anger, Inanna allows the demons to take Dumuzid back to the underworld as her replacement. Dumuzid's sister Geshtinanna is grief-stricken and volunteers to spend half the year in the underworld, during which time Dumuzid can go free. The Ishtar myth presumably had a comparable ending, Belili being the Babylonian equivalent of Geshtinanna.|$|E
500|$|According to Levine and Jim Farber of the New York Daily News, [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] was Rihanna's most pop-sounding song since [...] "Don't Stop the Music". Analyzing the song, the BBC's Fraser McAlpine {{questioned}} why [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] {{leaves a}} [...] "positive impression" [...] on the listener despite its arrogant, domineering tone. Critical at first ("Listen to the pneumatic hiss {{at the heart}} of this song. Try and endure the pumping thrust without getting winded. There is simply too much pressure being stuffed into our ears, with too much brutal force"), he concluded that Rihanna sings the song with great passion and gave it four stars out of five. James Dolan gave the song two-and-a-half stars out of five in Rolling Stone, writing that [...] "the trance beat won't keep you in the club unless <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> paying for the drinks." ...|$|E
500|$|Amy Benfer of Salon.com {{wrote in}} 2010 that, {{according}} to figures released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pregnancy rates for all teenagers dropped 2 percent between 2007 and 2008, meaning that [...] "the slight uptick in teen pregnancy rates between 2005 and 2006 were probably just an anomaly and not some heinous trend brought about by pop culture", and that {{if there had been}} {{such a thing as a}} [...] "Juno effect", it would have caused pregnancies to go down, not up. She criticized proponents of the theory, stating that they believed that teenagers [...] "somehow lose all ability to evaluate any nuance or context in that woman's particular situation, and instead make some sort of primitive cause-and-effect connection" [...] and that [...] "by talking about pregnant girls, and most of all, by daring to portray some of them as ordinary, even likable, we'd get way more babies having babies." [...] She concluded that [...] "depicting teen parents may not glamorize them, so much as humanize them. You know, that thing that happens when one person recognizes that <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> a person too? So, now that we can firmly state that realistically depicting the lives of the tiny percentage of girls who do become pregnant won't necessarily contaminate the rest of them, it's time to stop worrying and ask what we can do to help." ...|$|E

500|$|Erik Ernst of The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel {{said the}} song was [...] "ridiculously catchy". Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly decided that [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] was Cyrus' bouncy attempt at urban music, since she had {{previously}} transitioned into other markets. Jessica Holland of The Observer deemed [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] {{one of the highlights}} on The Time of Our Lives. Michael Menachem of Billboard stated {{the song was}} one of Cyrus' most entertaining songs. Menachem continued, [...] " [...] injects the song with an energy recalling Robyn and early Gwen Stefani. After successfully tackling dance and country formats and delivering one of the year's strongest ballads ('The Climb'), Cyrus continues to show off her impressive range." [...] Ryan Brockington of The New York Post said that although the track was more mainstream than Cyrus' prior singles, he did not hate it. Vicki Lutas of BCC described [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] as [...] "a breath of fresh air" [...] while being [...] "seriously stomping" [...] and slightly relatable. She said the song's best attribute was Cyrus' voice and concluded that Cyrus contains an ability of making her voice sound interesting all the time. Upon listening to the track, Lutas feels that [...] "suddenly you think <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> in the room with you and you've got all the ingredients for, well, a huge party contained in one little song." ...|$|E
500|$|Preparing for {{the episode}} was {{physically}} difficult {{for some of}} the cast members, most of whom had little experience singing and dancing. They spent three months in voice training. Two choreographers worked with Whedon and the cast on dance sequences. Michelle Trachtenberg (Dawn), who is trained in ballet, requested a dance sequence in lieu of a significant singing part, and Alyson Hannigan (Willow), according to Whedon, begged him not to give her many lines. Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy) told the BBC that [...] "It took something like 19hours of singing and 17hours of dancing in between shooting four other episodes" [...] and she was so anxious about singing that she [...] "hated every moment of it". When Whedon suggested using a voice double for her, however, she said, [...] "I basically started to cry and said, 'You mean <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> going to do my big emotional turning point for the season?' In the end, it was an incredible experience and I'm glad I did it. And I never want to do it again." [...] Davies was so impressed with Hinton Battle's performance on Broadway in The Wiz that he asked Battle to play the demon Sweet. Battle, a three-time Tony-winner, wore prosthetic make-up {{for the first time to}} give him a demonic red face. Sweet was portrayed as [...] "slick", smooth and stylish; in contrast, most demons on the series were designed to be crude and ugly. The set for The Bronze was used frequently throughout the series, but stairs were built from the stage to maximize floor space for Battle's dance.|$|E

2500|$|By 1982, {{the latent}} strains in his {{relationship}} with Mrs Thatcher became fully apparent. She complained that he was dismissive of the obstacles she was encountering in dismantling the legacy of decades of socialism, while he berated her for betraying the promise of her early years. After his exclusion from her inner circle she nevertheless continued to regard him with [...] "exasperated affection", and rewarded him with a knighthood in 1983. Yet in the 1990s he said of her, [...] "Lady Thatcher is great theatre as long as <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> writing her lines; she hasn't got a clue".

2500|$|The British Government, in authorising {{the letters}} {{despatched}} to King Hussein [...] before {{the outbreak of}} the revolt by Sir Henry McMahon, would seem to raise a doubt as to whether our pledges to King Hussein as head of the Arab nation are consistent with French intentions to make not only Syria but Upper Mesopotamia another Tunis. If our support of King Hussein and the other Arabian leaders of less distinguished origin and prestige means anything it means that we are prepared to recognize the full sovereign independence of the Arabs of Arabia and Syria. It would seem time to acquaint the French Government with our detailed pledges to King Hussein, and to make it clear to the latter whether he or <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> to be the ruler of Damascus, which is the one possible capital for an Arab State, which could command the obedience of the other Arabian Emirs.|$|E

2500|$|Show creator Jason Rothenberg said he {{and others}} {{involved}} with the series were aware of Debnam-Carey while casting Clarke in 2014; although the chance for her to portray Clarke never materialized, her name was brought up while casting Lexa. He called the casting a [...] "no-brainer"; she did not audition for the role, but was rather offered it. At the time, Debnam-Carey was also being considered {{for the role of}} Alicia Clark on Fear the Walking Dead. [...] "That's always a concern when you have an actor in your show that is popping—that <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> going to grab them and make them a series regular if you don't. That's kind of what happened in this case," [...] stated Rothenberg, who considered Debnam-Carey's performance on The 100 [...] "amazing". He added, [...] "You know we can't compete on some level with the cache of a franchise like that, with the numbers." [...] Debnam-Carey was allowed to continue work on both shows. [...] Rothenberg said he {{would have done the same}} had it been the other way around, with creators asking to borrow one of his actors, and he would have done his best to make the situation work.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a nod to}} {{eighteenth century}} British amatory fiction, Welcome to Temptation explores the {{boundaries}} {{between public and private}} life, using gossip and the protagonists' seemingly private sexual interactions. [...] The original amatory novels, such as those by Delarivier Manley, contained erotic scenes of seduction, often framed in a voyeuristic way (looking through a window), but also a retelling of gossip, primarily [...] "salacious scandal about real political figures of the day". [...] Critic Kimberly Baldus refers to this shifting between the public and private as liminality. [...] Crusie's heroine embraces this; entire scenes of the screenplay she is writing are based on, or entirely taken from, conversations or sexual interactions she has had with the hero. [...] The protagonists' first sexual encounter occurs outdoors, with the possibility of discovery. [...] Sophie [...] "willingly exposes herself on screen" [...] by including the event in her film. When the scene is filmed for the movie, the characters realize that <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> watching the scene through binoculars, illustrating [...] "the difficulty of completely controlling visual display". [...] Inclusion in the script turns a private interlude between two individuals public, yet the binocular-holding character turns a relatively private moment of filming into a more public event. [...] When the more erotic version of the movie is stolen and shown on local television, the characters must confront the knowledge that their most private moments are now essentially public property.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Tom Perrotta of The Wall Street Journal called Radwańska [...] "the most tactically sound, subtle {{tennis player}} in the world." [...] Over the years she has been given the nicknames [...] "The Magician", [...] "Ninja" [...] and [...] "The Professor", {{due to the fact}} that she can pull off the most {{difficult}} shots in the game with ease. Radwańska's game is founded on variety, mobility, and a tendency to anticipate her opponent's actions. She often uses this style to construct rallies—either opening the court up for a winner, or prompting a surprised opponent to hit a misplaced return. Her primary weapons include a mixture of slices and lobs, along with her ability to hit the ball at a variety of angles. She also makes use of a disguised drop shot, often swung with the same motion as a normal stroke during a rally. She is also noted for her crouching shots, during which she quickly drops in place to return or redirect a low ball, along with her use of an overhead backhand while on defense. In fact, she is known for having invented her distinctive squat position shot, where she sits so low on her haunches that she can play half-volleys with a horizontal racket. “I’m not sure if I invented it,” says Radwanska, “but I was definitely one of the first ones. When I watch TV, I can hear commentators say that was my shot, even if <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> playing, so it’s nice to hear I can put something new into tennis”.|$|E
