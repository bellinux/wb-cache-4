25|$|In {{all these}} <b>painters,</b> <b>colours</b> are often very muted, with browns dominating, {{especially}} {{in the middle of}} the century. This is less true of the works of Jan Davidsz de Heem (1606–1684), an important figure who spent much of his career based over the border in Antwerp. Here his displays began to sprawl sideways to form wide oblong pictures, unusual in the north, although Heda sometimes painted taller vertical compositions. Still life painters were especially prone to form dynasties, it seems: there were many de Heems and Bosschaerts, Heda's son continued in his father's style, and Claesz was the father of Nicholaes Berchem.|$|R

60|$|And secondly, as to {{the other}} of these {{operations}} on colours, that is, the deepning of them, Limners and <b>Painters</b> <b>colours</b> {{are for the most}} part also uncapable. For they being for the most part opacous; and that opacousness, as I said before, proceeding from the particles, being very much flaw'd, unless we were able to joyn and re-unite those flaw'd particles again into one piece, we shall not be able to deepen the colour, which since we are unable to do with most of the colours which are by Painters accounted opacous, we are therefore unable to deepen them by adding more of the same kind.|$|R

60|$|There are multitudes {{of other}} kinds of Sands, which in many particulars, plainly enough discoverable by the Microscope, differ both from these last mention'd kinds of Sands, and from one another: there seeming to be as great variety of Sands, as there is of Stones. And as amongst Stones some are call'd {{precious}} from their excellency, so also are there Sands which deserve the same Epithite for their beauty; for viewing a small parcel of East-India Sand (which was given me by my highly honoured friend, Mr. Daniel Colwall) and, since that, another parcel, {{much of the same}} kind, I found several of them, both very transparent like precious Stones, and regularly figur'd like Crystal, Cornish Diamants, some Rubies, &c. and also ting'd with very lively and deep colours, like Rubys, Saphyrs, Emeralds, &c. These kinds of granuls I have often found also in English Sand. And 'tis easie to make such a counterfeit Sand with deeply ting'd Glass, Enamels and <b>Painters</b> <b>colours.</b>|$|R
