50|$|Computer programmers {{often are}} grouped into two broad types: {{application}} <b>programmers</b> and <b>systems</b> <b>programmers.</b> Application programmers write programs {{to handle a}} specific job, such as a program to track inventory within an organization. They also may revise existing packaged software or customize generic applications which are frequently purchased from independent software vendors. <b>Systems</b> <b>programmers,</b> in contrast, write programs to maintain and control computer systems software, such as operating systems and database management systems. These workers make changes in the instructions that determine how the network, workstations, and CPU of the system handle the various jobs they have been given and how they communicate with peripheral equipment such as printers and disk drives.|$|R
