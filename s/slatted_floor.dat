40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to find whether {{laminitis}} like changes in beef cattle were affected by flooring systems and different breeds. Studied breeds were Bayerisch Fleckvieh and Holstein Frisian and the different <b>flooring</b> systems were <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> of iron, concrete and rubber. At slaughter the hind-claws were collected and investigated for the angle between distal phalanx and sole, between distal phalanx and dorsal wall of the claw, haemorrhages of toe and heel area, and the concavity of the dorsal wall. Animals kept on rubber <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> showed a greater angle between distal phalanx and dorsal wall of the claw (P< 0, 01). This change is caused by a greater activity and due to a change of the position of the claw. No relationship was found for concavity and different <b>slatted</b> <b>floors.</b> However claws from bulls kept on concrete <b>slatted</b> <b>floors,</b> showed a convex shape. Most likely the roughness of the concrete is the cause of it.

The overall prevalence of foot lesions was 39. 6 % in 2283 pigs from 90 representative pig farms in England. The most prevalent lesions were heel/sole bruising (7. 1 %), heel/sole erosion (10. 8 %), heel flaps (8. 4 %) and toe erosion (11. 6 %). Pigs were kept on either solid (41 %), partly slatted (28 %) or fully <b>slatted</b> (31 %) <b>floors.</b> Of the 104 pens with a solid floor, 26 % of pens were outside with straw bedding on a soil base, 33 % were indoors with deep bedding on solid concrete, 25 % were partly deeply bedded on solid concrete and 16 % were sparsely bedded on solid concrete. Only six of the pens with partly <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> were bedded. Multilevel logistic-regression models were built using data from 100 farms to examine the risks for individual foot lesions with prevalences > 5 %. The prevalence of toe erosions was positively associated with deep bedding, whereas deep bedding and soil floors were negatively associated with the prevalence of heel/sole erosions. Heel flaps and heel/sole bruising were both associated with <b>slatted</b> <b>floors,</b> possibly indicating a common aetiology. The greatest reduction in prevalence of all these lesions, from AFp calculations, would be achieved by moving pigs from <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> onto solid floors...|$|R

40|$|Few {{issues in}} swine {{production}} are {{as complex as}} floor space allowances. One method for pork producers to calculate floor space allowance (A) is to convert BW into a 2 -dimensional concept yielding an expression of A = k * BW 0. 667. Data on ADG, ADFI, and G:F were obtained from published peer-reviewed studies. Five data sets were created: A = grower-finisher pigs, fully <b>slatted</b> <b>floors,</b> and consistent group size; B = grower-finisher pigs and fully <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> (group size {{did not need to}} be consistent); C = grower-finisher pigs, partially <b>slatted</b> <b>floors,</b> and consistent group size; D = grower-finisher pigs, partially <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> (group size {{did not need to be}} consistent); and E = nursery pigs, fully slatted or woven wire floors (group size did not need to be consistent). Each data set was analyzed using a broken-line analysis and a linear regression. For the broken-line analyses, the critical k value, below which a decrease in ADG occurred, varied from 0. 0317 to 0. 0348. In all cases the effect of space allowance on ADG was significant (P < 0. 05). Using the linear analyses based on data with k values of 0. 10); however, none of the linear regressions explained a significant proportion of the variation in ADG. The slopes for the nonplateau portion of the broken-line analyses based on percent values varied among data sets. For every 0. 001 decrease in k (approximately 3 % of the critical k value), ADG decreased by 0. 56 to 1. 41 %, with an average value of 0. 98 % for the 5 %-based analyses. The use of an allometric approach to express space allowance and broken-line analysis to establish space requirements seem to be useful tools for pig production. The critical k value at which crowding becomes detrimental to the growth of the pig is similar in full- and partial-slat systems and in nursery and grower-finisher stages.

5000|$|Extensive cuniculture {{refers to}} the {{practice}} of keeping rabbits at a lower density and a lower production level than intensive culture. Specifically as relates to rabbits, this type of production was nearly universal prior to germ theory understanding of infectious parasites (especially coccidia) and the role of nutrition in prevention of abortion and reproductive loss. The most extensive rabbit [...] "keeping" [...] methods would be the harvest of wild or feral rabbits for meat or fur market, such as occurred in Australia prior to the 1990s. Warren-based cuniculture is somewhat more controlled, as the animals are generally kept to a specific area and a limited amount of supplemental feeding provided. Finally, various methods of raising rabbits with pasture as the primary food source have been developed. Pasturing rabbits within a fence (but not a cage) also known as colony husbandry, has not been commonly pursued due to the high death rate from weather and predators. More commonly (but still rare in terms of absolute numbers of rabbits and practitioners) is the practice of confining the rabbits to a moveable cage with an open or <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> so that the rabbits can access grass but still be kept at hand and protected from weather and predators. This method of growing rabbits does not typically result in an over-all reduction for the need for supplemented feed. The growing period to market weight is much longer for grass fed rather than pellet fed animals, and many producers continue to offer small amounts of complete rations {{over the course of the}} growing period. Hutches or cages for this type of husbandry are generally made of a combination of wood and metal wire, made portable enough for a person to move the rabbits daily to fresh ground, and of a size to hold a litter of 6 to 12 rabbits at the market weight of 4 to 5 pounds. Protection from sun and driving rain are important health concerns, as is durability against predator attacks and the ability to be cleaned to prevent loss from coccidious. Medical care and the use of medicated feed are less common.|$|E

40|$|A cross {{sectional}} study of 103 {{indoor and outdoor}} British pig farms {{was carried out in}} 2003 - 2004. Over 12, 000 pigs aged from 3 days up to multiparious breeding sows were examined. Prevalence of foot, limb and body lesions and lameness was recorded using clear case definitions. Detailed data were also collected on the pen or paddock that the pigs were housed in with particular reference to the floor design, material and condition. Associations between prevalence of disease and the environment the pig was housed in were analysed using multilevel regression models. Post-mortem examination of a small sample of foot and limb lesions was carried out to better understand the pathology. There was a lower prevalence of body and limb lesions in pigs of all ages, and foot lesions in preweaning piglets, housed outdoors compared with indoors. However, there was little difference in the prevalence of foot lesions and lameness in gilts and pregnant sows kept indoors compared with outdoors. In most pigs housed indoors, there was a trend for an increased risk of limb and body lesions and lameness in pigs housed on hard and <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> compared with solid concrete floors with bedding. Although, in contrast to this the prevalence of wounds on the limbs in piglets was lower on <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> compared with solid concrete floors. The associations between foot lesions and indoor floor type varied with the age of the pig and the type of lesion. In piglets, sole bruising was associated with housing on <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> while sole erosion was associated with housing on solid concrete floors without bedding. In gilts and sows, heel flaps were associated with housing on <b>slatted</b> <b>floors</b> while toe erosion was associated with solid floors with deep bedding.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Laboratory {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} study the influence of airflow on ammonia emissions from pig house slurry in a model growing/finishing pig house with slurry in the pit and a clean <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> with various opening areas, 100 %, 33. 3 %, and 16. 7 %. The 100 % opening area meant that the headspace {{was an integral part}} of the room air space, and this configuration was used as the reference treatment. The pig house model had two sidewall inlets and exhaust in the middle of the ceiling. The liquid slurry used was from a growing/finishing pig building and consisted of 1 % to 2 % dry matter, had pH of 8. 05, and TAN (total ammonia nitrogen) of 2. 38 g/L. Experiments in a model growing/finishing swine barn were conducted to determine the effects of room ventilation rate, slurry pit air exchange rates, <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> openings, and pit headspace on ammonia emissions. The results showed that ammonia emission rate increased as ventilation rate increased with a constant inlet opening. Increase in the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> opening ratio increased the air exchange rate in the slurry pit, resulting in a higher ammonia emission rate. Different correlations between the ammonia emission rate and the air headspace height in the slurry pit caused by the type of flow in the boundary layer influenced the ammonia transport from the slurry surface to the ventilation air. A statistical model was developed to calculate the ammonia emission rate as a function of ventilation rate, <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> opening ratio, and slurry pit headspace (R 2 = 0. 93). It was found that the NH 3 emission rate was more sensitive to the ventilation rate than to the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> opening ratio and air headspace height in the pit. In addition, the NH 3 emission rate was much more sensitive to variations in the ventilation rate at low ventilation rates than at high ventilation rates. Similar sensitivity responses were obtained for both <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> opening ratio and air headspace height...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the concentration level of ammonia (NH 3), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), and carbon dioxide (CO 2) in two different fattening pig houses operated with <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> and straw flow system. The field study was performed for three day. One large-scale pig house with capacity of 230 pigs operate with deep litter manure system under the fully <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> and one small-scale pig feeding operation with capacity of 200 pigs operated by scraper and straw flow system, located at the Iksan city, South Korea, were investigated in this study. Average emissions of gases on the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> pig house measured were 59. 8 - 70. 5 ppm NH 3, 0. 048 - 0. 78 ppm H 2 S, 453. 1 - 650. 8 ppm CO 2 and 0. 21 - 0. 68 ppm N 2 O while the concentrations of these gases at straw flow pig house were determined as 28. 17 - 42. 53 ppm NH 3, 0. 11 - 0. 43 ppm N 2 O, 0. 018 - 0. 043 ppm H 2 S, 400. 2 - 498. 3 ppm CO 2. In general, result of H 2 S, CO 2, N 2 O and NH 3 emissions from the straw flow system were lower than values for fully <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> systems...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the emission, proper {{understanding}} of the transportation behaviour of gaseous ammonia inside the slurry pit is required. Numerical simulation by the aid of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique can be used for this purpose. However, direct modelling of slatted floors is complicated and may be replaced by the porous media model (PMM) as shown in earlier studies. The objective of our study is {{to improve the quality of}} simulation results by PMM, and to assess the effects of air velocity above the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> (as affected by wind), pit headspace height (as affected by amount of slurry in the pit) and sidewall height (as affected by the dairy house sidewall) on the airflow features inside the pit and ammonia emission from the pit. Three different CFD models of a <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> were developed to evaluate whether porous media is capable to represent a <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> for modelling the airflow inside and ammonia emission from the slurry pit, and to study the effect of turbulence treatment in the porous media on the modelling results: a <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> model (SFM) which models the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> as it is, a turbulent porous media model (PMM-T) and a laminar porous media model (PMM-L). Both PMM-T and PMM-L represent the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> by porous media, the PMM-T assumes turbulent airflow and the PMM-L assumes laminar airflow in the porous media. The SFM was verified for a dataset acquired from a 1 : 8 scale wind tunnel model of the slurry pit. Results showed that the PMM (PMM-T and PMM-L) were able to predict both the airflow features inside the slurry pit and the ammonia emission from the slurry pit if the resistance parameters and flow regime of the porous media were properly set. In comparison to the SFM, the PMM-T predicted the flow pattern better, but overestimated the turbulence intensity and the consequent emission rate. PMM-L performed better in predicting the ammonia emission rate because of the relatively accurate prediction of turbulence intensity. Simulation results also showed that the ammonia emission rate increased with a higher mean airflow velocity, a smaller headspace height and the presence of sidewalls. </p...|$|E

40|$|Concrete <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> {{has been}} the most common housing system for {{intensive}} beef cattle production in Sweden. The <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> is self-cleaning and does not require any bedding. The labour input therefore is minimal. Concerns have however, been expressed about the negative influence of systems with fully slatted floors on animal health and welfare. Consequently the interest in deep litter systems has grown in the recent years. These systems are considered to create better animal environment and they also allow cattle to be housed in uninsulated buildings. The aim of this report is to discuss suitable housing systems for beef cattle in Sweden in the 21 :st century. Both the economic and animal welfare aspects are considered. A housing system must primarily be evaluated based on the physiological and ethological demands of the animals. If the system does not fulfil these demands it should not be considered at all. A recommended housing system must furthermore be economic, both in terms of investment and operation cost. Animal health, aerial environment and the ethological suitability, are important not only to the animal welfare but also have a significant influence on the economic result of the production. The deep litter system is the most common alternative to the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> system in Sweden. The main disadvantages of the deep litter system are the large requirement of straw and the relatively high labour demand. The labour input depends very much on the straw handling system, both in the field and at the farmstead. The straw handling system is typically effective and well mechanised in the field, while transfer from the store and distribution in the bedded court too often is a cumbersome and heavy work. Inventive farmers have come up with their own technical solutions to solve these problems. An alternative to decrease the straw requirement is the sloped floor. The sloped floor is another very interesting housing system. Various types of sloped floor have been developed and used around Europe for several years and in recent years a few have been built in Sweden. The sloped floor system takes advantage of cattle preference for an elevated laying area. Animal movements transport the manure down the slop to a scraped passage and the higher parts of the bedded area remains relatively clean and dry. The building investment costs are much lower than that of a building with <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> and less straw is needed compared to a deep litter system. Labour input and costs directly connected to the housing system were compared in the fully <b>slatted</b> <b>floor,</b> deep straw bedding and sloped floor housing systems. The daily straw requirement was set to be 4 kg in the deep straw bedding system and 3 kg in the sloped floor system. The main difference between the systems was the time required for the straw and manure handling. Thus the labour input was shown to be lowest in the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> system and highest in the deep straw bedding system. The system related costs, i. e. the building, the manure handling system, straw material, straw handling and labour, were considered in the economic comparison. Eventually differences in daily gain, feed vonversion and energy input were not considered. Two alternatives were looked at. In the first cattle were kept indoor year round and in the second they were allowed a grazing period of 120 days/year. The differences between the systems were small, though the sloped floor had the lowest costs, irrespective of grazing period (see table below). The <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> system is expensive to construct while operation costs are low. Hence, to be competitive the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> system must be put to efficient use at all times to bring down the cost per animal. Big investment costs, such as systems with <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> pens, in combination with grazing, can be less profitable compared to straw bedded systems. The conclusion is that the same economic result can be achieved by raising beef cattle in considerably better animal welfare systems than <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> pens. Good alternatives are deep straw bedding or sloped floor in uninsulated buildings...|$|E
40|$|Two {{trials were}} {{conducted}} at experimental stations of IFIP, located in Romillé (France, Trial 1), and INRA, located in Saint Gilles (France, Trial 2), on pregnant sows equipped with individual ear tag accelerometers {{to record their}} activity level: duration of lying, standing and moving sequences. The first trial involved 72 sows penned on a <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> in a dynamic group with connected drinkers and automatic feeders, whereas the second trial was carried out on 4 small groups of 6 sows penned on a concrete floor with straw and fed in individual stalls. Firstly, an algorithm was built from video recordings of 24 sows on the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> (2 x 2 h sequences per sow, 96 h). Secondly, {{the accuracy of the}} algorithm was assessed by recording and sequencing 96 h and 109 h, respectively, on the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> and concrete floor with straw. The respective sensitivities of the lying, standing and moving behaviours on the <b>slatted</b> <b>floor</b> were 94. 4 %, 66. 9 % and 68. 4 %. With straw, lower sensitivity values were found: 93. 65 % for lying, 68. 35 % for standing and 38. 83 % for moving, linked to more investigative behaviours using the head. The final step was to use these data to improve the feeding practices of pregnant sows, taking their activity level into account. The strong inter- and intra-individual variability shown in the physical activity is a limiting factor for detection of health problems, such as lameness, through the accelerometers. Thus we need additional information, especially the behaviour data generated by identified drinkers and automatic feeders...|$|E
40|$|To address odour and gas {{problems}} {{generated by}} livestock facilities, air dispersion {{models have been}} used to determine reasonable science-based setback distances between the livestock operations and the neighbouring residences. However, none of the existing models consider diurnal, seasonal and climate variations of odour and gas (ammonia, hydrogen sulphide, carbon dioxide) concentrations and emission rates (OGCER), which may result in great uncertainties in setback distance calculations. Thus, the purpose of this project was to monitor and model diurnal and seasonal OGCER from swine grower/finisher rooms. Specifically, this research was conducted to: 1) characterize diurnal OGCER between two different flooring systems (fully and partially slatted floorings) under three different weather conditions (August, October and February); 2) identify seasonal OGCER over a 12 -month measuring period; and 3) develop mathematical models to predict the OGCER. A two-factorial strip-block experiment was designed for measuring diurnal OGCER in two grower/finisher rooms. It was found that: 1) the diurnal OGCER in the fully <b>slatted</b> <b>flooring</b> system was 27. 6 to 39. 5 % higher than that in the partially <b>slatted</b> <b>flooring</b> system; however, no significant differences in the diurnal OGCER were found between the two rooms, except for the NH 3 concentrations in August, the NH 3 and H 2 S concentrations and emissions in October, and odour concentrations and emissions in February (P > 0. 05), and 2) significant diurnal variations in the OGCER (except for the odour concentrations and H 2 S emissions) have been observed in August (P 0. 05). A repeated measurement method was used to monitor seasonal OGCER in four grower/finisher rooms over a period of 12 months. It was found that: 1) the seasonal OGCER from the fully <b>slatted</b> <b>flooring</b> system was 2. 9 to 40. 6 % higher than that from the partially <b>slatted</b> <b>flooring</b> system; however, the seasonal OGCER (except for the NH 3 concentrations in October, November and January; the CO 2 concentrations in August and the CO 2 emissions in December) between the two different floors for each measuring month did not differ significantly (P > 0. 05); and 2) the seasonal OGCER was significantly affected by the sampling month (P < 0. 05), and no specific seasonal pattern was observed. The statistical models developed for each type of the flooring system determined the OGCER based on the room and ambient temperatures, the ventilation rates and the animal units. The predicted results showed good agreement with measured values for most of OGCER (r 2 : 0. 67 - 0. 95). In order to improve odour and gas prediction models, animal activity and dirtiness of pens should be further investigated...|$|R
