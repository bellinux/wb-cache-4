5|$|According to plan, the Syrians {{attacked}} {{from the}} southern Golan Heights, {{just south of the}} <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Galilee</b> through al-Hama and the Yarmouk River, hitting a densely populated Jewish area of settlement. This came as a surprise to the Haganah, which expected an attack from south Lebanon and Mishmar HaYarden. The Jewish villages on the original confrontation line were Ein Gev, Masada, Sha'ar HaGolan and both Deganias.|$|E

5000|$|In 2013 he was {{commissioned}} by the Australian War Memorial to paint a ten by three metre background {{as part of the}} World War I centenary commemorations. The diorama depicts the 1918 Battle of Semakh that unfolded on the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Galilee's</b> southern shore in the last months of the Sinai and Palestine campaign. This new background (originally painted by Louis McCubbin in 1926 -1927) is a continuation of a vision first outlined by the memorial’s founder Charles Bean back in 1918, where in a letter to memorial director [...] John Treloar, he insisted that the dioramas not be just a purely didactic display - “not a sort of Noah’s ark model… but a real picture, with the atmosphere, the gradations of shade and colour, the feeling of the scene, created by an artist.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Galilee (הגליל, {{transliteration}} HaGalil); الجليل, translit. al-Jalīl) is {{a region}} in northern Israel. The term Galilee traditionally {{refers to the}} mountainous part, divided into Upper Galilee (גליל עליון Galil Elyon) and Lower Galilee (גליל תחתון Galil Tahton). In the modern common usage, Galilee refers {{to all of the}} area that is beyond Mount Carmel to the northeast, extending from Dan to the north, at the base of Mount Hermon, along Mount Lebanon to the ridges of Mount Carmel and Mount Gilboa north of Jenin to the south, and from the Jordan Rift Valley to the east across the plains of the Jezreel Valley and Acre to the shores <b>of</b> the Mediterranean <b>Sea</b> and the coastal plain in the west, including Beth Shean's valley, <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Galilee's</b> valley, and Hula Valley, although it usually does not include Haifa's immediate northern suburbs. By this definition it overlaps with much of the administrative Northern District of the country (which also includes the Golan Heights and part of Menashe Heights but not Qiryat Tiv'on). Western Galilee (גליל מערבי Galil Ma'aravi) is a common term referring to the western part <b>of</b> the Upper <b>Galilee</b> and its shore, and usually also the northwestern part <b>of</b> the Lower <b>Galilee,</b> mostly overlapping with Acre sub district. Galilee Panhandle is a common term referring to the [...] "panhandle" [...] in the east that extends to the north, where Lebanon is to the west, and includes Hula Valley and Ramot Naftali mountains <b>of</b> the Upper <b>Galilee.</b> Historically, the part of Southern Lebanon south of the east-west section of the Litani River also belonged to the region <b>of</b> <b>Galilee,</b> but the present article mainly deals with the Israeli part of the region.|$|R
5|$|The loss of Tiberias ended Liman von Sanders' {{plans for}} a rearguard line {{extending}} from the Yarmuk via the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Galilee</b> and on to Lake Huleh. The remnants of the Tiberias and Samakh garrisons established a strong rearguard south of Lake Huleh, at Jisr Benat Yakub which was attacked and captured during the pursuit to Damascus.|$|E
5|$|Units of the 4th Light Horse Brigade {{subsequently}} advanced {{along the}} western shore of the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Galilee,</b> to jointly occupy the town of Tiberias with units from the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, which advanced from Nazareth over the hills. These victories concluded the Battle of Sharon and the Battle of Megiddo.|$|E
5|$|On Friday, May 14, the Syrian 1st Infantry Brigade, {{commanded}} by Colonel Abdullah Wahab el-Hakim, was in Southern Lebanon, positioned to attack Malkia. That day Hakim {{was ordered to}} return to Syria, move south across the Golan and enter Palestine south of the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Galilee</b> through Samakh (Tzemah). He began to advance at 9:00 AM on Saturday and had only two of his battalions, where the soldiers were already exhausted.|$|E
40|$|Wetland {{management}} {{usually involves}} multiple stakeholders. This paper {{describes how the}} use of the ecosystem services (ES) concept can help to identify the main stakeholders associated with wetland conservation, using the Hula Wetland in the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Galilee’s</b> watershed as a case study. We conducted a stakeholder analysis based on semi-structured interviews. We focused on the management of two semi-natural areas within the larger Hula Wetland area (Hula Nature Reserve and Agamon), in which different management regimes are used and which provide different bundles of ES to different stakeholders. Using the ES concept in the stakeholder analysis, we were able to present the Hula Wetland management in a comprehensive manner. The approach also revealed a lack of coordination between the managing organisations which might lead to competition favouring cultural services (in particular tourism) at the expense of habitat services (i. e. biodiversity conservation) in the future. To test our method we also conducted a stakeholder analysis in the Camargue Wetland in France. The two wetlands have similar characteristics but are embedded in different institutional contexts. The Camargue Regional Park has a multi-stakeholder platform which could serve as an example for the Hula Wetland to improve its management and lead to better coordination and complementarity of ES provided by the two sub-sites. Our study showed that applying the ES concept helps to quickly identify relevant stakeholders and analyse wetland management in a more holistic way and to point towards sustainable solutions for conflicting stakeholder interests...|$|R
5000|$|An earlier water {{development}} scheme was proposed by Walter C. Lowdermilk {{in his book}} Palestine, Land of Promise, published in 1944; it was developed with human and financial assistance from the American Zionist Emergency Council. The book became a bestseller, and important in swaying the debate within the Truman administration concerning immigrant absorptive capacity and the Negev as part of Israel. His book served {{as the basis for}} a detailed water resource plan which was prepared by James Hayes, an engineer from the USA, who proposed utilizing all water sources in Israel (2 km³ per annum) for irrigation and the production of electricity. This would involve diverting part of the Litani River water to the Hasbani River. This water which would be further transported by a dam and canal to the area south of Tel Hai, from where it would be [...] "dropped" [...] to produce electricity. Water would also be carried from Tel Hai to the Beit Netofa Valley which would become a national water reservoir, of about one billion cu.m. volume (one quarter <b>of</b> the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Galilee's</b> volume). An electricity generating station would be located at the reservoir's outlet, from where the water would flow into an open canal to Rafiah, which, whilst travelling south would collect water from wadis and streams, including the waters of the Yarkon River. Hayes also asserted that the Yarmouk River would be channeled into Lake Kinneret, in order to prevent a rise in its salinity which could come about {{as a result of the}} diversion of the River Jordan, and that a joint Israeli-Jordanian dam about 5 km east of kibbutz Sha'ar HaGolan would be constructed. The Hayes plan was designed to be implemented in two stages over a 10-year period, but never materialised due to its economic infeasibility and lack of cooperation by Jordan.|$|R

5|$|On Saturday night, May 15, the {{observation}} posts reported many vehicles with full lights moving along the Golan ridge {{east of the}} <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Galilee.</b> The opening shots were fired by Syrian artillery on kibbutz Ein Gev at approximately 01:00 on May 16. At dawn, Syrian aircraft attacked the Kinarot valley villages. The following day, a Syrian company which split from the main force attacked the water station with heavy weaponry, where every worker was killed except one.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} climatic areas in Israel and areas it has settled that allow {{a variety of}} {{products}} to be grown. Citrus trees such as orange, lemon and grapefruit thrive on the coastal plain. Figs, pomegranates and olives also grow in the cooler hill areas. The subtropical climate near the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Galilee</b> and in the Jordan River Valley is suitable for mangoes, kiwis and bananas, while the temperate climate of the mountains of the Galilee and the Golan is suitable for grapes, apples and cherries.|$|E
5|$|As {{the rest}} of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade {{advanced}} to Tiberias, their left flank moved over the site of the 1187AD Battle of Hattin. On 26 September, the 3rd Light Horse Brigade camped to the north of Tiberias, at Medjel on the shore of the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Galilee.</b> A squadron of the 9th Light Horse Regiment rode out at 12:30 to investigate reports of a considerable enemy force at Safed. By the time they arrived at 18:00, the force had withdrawn. Meanwhile, the 8th Light Horse Regiment restored order in the town and established guards on stores of grain while the remainder of the brigade rested after their night-time advance.|$|E

60|$|Indeed, the Jews {{did make}} one {{objection}} against Jesus Christ {{that seemed to}} them to have weight in it, and that was, because he first began to appear and manifest his glory in Cana <b>of</b> <b>Galilee.</b> At this, I say, they stumbled. It was their sore temptation; for still, as some affirmed {{him to be the}} Christ, others as fast objected, 'Shall Christ come out of Galilee?'

5|$|Fresh fish {{is readily}} available, caught off Israel's coastal {{areas of the}} Mediterranean and the Red Sea, or in the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Galilee,</b> or raised in ponds {{in the wake of}} {{advances}} in fish farming in Israel. Fresh fish is served whole, in the Mediterranean style, grilled, or fried, dressed only with freshly squeezed lemon juice. Trout (called forel), gilthead seabream (called denisse), St. Peter's fish (known as 'musht') and other fresh fish are prepared this way. Fish are also eaten baked, with or without vegetables, or fried whole or in slices, or grilled over coals, and served with different sauces.|$|E
5|$|In John, Mary {{is alone}} at first, but Peter and the beloved disciple {{come and see}} the tomb as well. Jesus then appears to Mary at the tomb. He later appears to the disciples, {{breathes}} on them, and gives them the power to forgive and retain sins. In a second visit to disciples, he proves to a doubting disciple ("Doubting Thomas") that he is flesh and blood. The disciples return to Galilee, where Jesus makes another appearance. He performs a miracle known as the catch of 153 fish at the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Galilee,</b> after which Jesus encourages Peter to serve his followers.|$|E
5|$|In Tibnin, in modern-day Lebanon, and in Safad, Zahir or his son Ali had Crusader-era fortresses rebuilt.

If this line, across the two main roads and railway lines to Damascus could be held, time could be gained for the consolidation of the retreating columns into a strong defence of Damascus.|$|E
5|$|Philip {{was born}} in a village in Auranitis, part of the {{district}} of Trachonitis, east of the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Galilee</b> in Palestine. Philip renamed the village Philippopolis (the modern al-Shahbā', Syria) during his reign as emperor. He was one of only three Easterners to be made emperor before the decisive separation of East and West in 395. (The other two were Elagabalus and Alexander Severus). Even among Easterners Philip was atypical, as he was an Arab, not a Greek. His father was Julius Marinus; nothing besides his name is known, but the name indicates that he held Roman citizenship and that he must have been prominent in his community.|$|E
5|$|The Israelis {{called the}} {{reinforcements}} assuming {{this was the}} main Syrian thrust. The Syrians were not intending to carry out any further operation south of the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Galilee</b> and planned to make their main effort further north, near the Bnot Ya'akov bridge. On May 19, the Iraqis were about to drive west through Nablus toward Tulkarm, and asked the Syrians to make a diversion in the Degania area to protect their right flank. The Syrians complied, their main objective being to seize the bridge across the river north of Degania Alef, thus blocking any Israeli attack from Tiberias against the Iraqi line of communications.|$|E

5|$|The sea {{appears in}} human culture in {{contradictory}} ways, as both powerful but serene and as beautiful but dangerous. It has {{its place in}} mythology and religion, literature, art, poetry, film, theater, and music. The Ancients personified it, believing it {{to be under the}} control of a being who needed to be appeased. It has been populated by fantastic creatures: the Leviathan of the Bible, Scylla in Greek mythology, Isonade in Japanese mythology, and the kraken of late Norse mythology. The sea is especially common in Christian imagery, where several of Jesus's disciples were said to have been fishermen on the <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Galilee.</b>|$|E
5|$|This {{development}} {{gave the}} Israeli forces time to organize their defenses at Samakh (Tzemah). During {{the course of}} May 16, Israeli gunboats harassed the Syrian positions on the southeastern <b>Sea</b> <b>of</b> <b>Galilee</b> shore, trenches were dug, and roadblocks were set up. Meanwhile, Syrian aircraft made bombing runs on Masada, Sha'ar HaGolan, Degania Bet and Afikim. The attack on Samakh (Tzemah) resumed before dawn on May 17—the Syrians attacked the village's northern positions, but their armor stayed behind. The infantry thus could not advance into the concentrated Israeli fire from the village itself, despite severe ammunition shortages on the Israeli side.|$|E
