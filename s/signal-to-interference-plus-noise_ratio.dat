50|$|In {{information}} theory and telecommunication engineering, the <b>signal-to-interference-plus-noise</b> <b>ratio</b> (SINR) (also {{known as the}} signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SNIR)) is a quantity used to give theoretical upper bounds on channel capacity (or the rate of information transfer) in wireless communication systems such as networks. Analogous to the SNR used often in wired communications systems, the SINR {{is defined as the}} power of a certain signal of interest divided by the sum of the interference power (from all the other interfering signals) and the power of some background noise. If the power of noise term is zero, then the SINR reduces to the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR). Conversely, zero interference reduces the SINR to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which is used less often when developing mathematical models of wireless networks such as cellular networks.|$|E

30|$|Exploding {{demand for}} ever-higher data {{throughputs}} in cellular networks {{is one of}} the main drivers behind their current evolution toward the 5 th generation [1]. As a promising solution for increased throughput, multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) techniques have been introduced [2], in which several single- and/or multiple-antenna users receive their corresponding signals simultaneously from multiple-antenna base stations (BSs). High spectral efficiency gains potentially achievable with MIMO spatial multiplexing are available at high <b>signal-to-interference-plus-noise</b> <b>ratios</b> (SINRs). However, to maximize capacity, cellular networks are normally designed to allow high levels of inter-cell interference, which prevents high spatial multiplexing gains.

The impact of imperfect channel estimation of desired user signals is considered, and the effect of phase and time misalignments between desired and undesired signals is incorporated in the analysis. Precise formulation for Nakagami-m faded interfering signals is presented.
