5000|$|Tachyonic fields indeed {{arise in}} many {{versions}} of string theory. In general, string theory states {{that what we}} see as [...] "particles" [...] (electrons, photons, gravitons and so forth) are actually different vibrational states of the same underlying string. The mass of the particle can be deduced from the vibrations which the string exhibits; roughly speaking, the mass depends upon the [...] "note" [...] which the string sounds. Tachyons frequently appear in the spectrum of permissible string states, {{in the sense that}} some states have negative mass-squared, and therefore, imaginary mass. If the tachyon appears as a vibrational mode of an open string, this signals an instability of the underlying D-brane system to which the string is attached. The system will then decay to a state of closed strings and/or stable D-branes. If the tachyon is a closed string vibrational mode, this indicates an instability in spacetime itself. Generally, it is not known (or theorized) what this system will decay to. However, if the closed string tachyon is localized around a <b>spacetime</b> <b>singularity,</b> the endpoint of the decay process will often have the singularity resolved.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{to what extent}} the fundamental question of <b>spacetime</b> <b>singularities</b> is relevant for the philosophical debate about the nature of spacetime. After reviewing some basic aspects of the <b>spacetime</b> <b>singularities</b> within general relativity, we argue that the well known difficulty to localize them in a meaningful way may challenge the received metaphysical view of spacetime as a set of points possessing some intrinsic properties together with some spatiotemporal relations. Considering the algebraic for-mulation of general relativity, we argue that the <b>spacetime</b> <b>singularities</b> highlight the philosophically misleading dependence on the standard geometric representation of spacetime. 1. Introduction. Despite Earman’s (1995) invitation to consider more carefully the question of <b>spacetime</b> <b>singularities,</b> only a little literature in spacetime philosophy has been devoted to this foundational issue.

Below the same is drawn using spherical coordinates, radius r with center O and two angles phi and theta. The figure at right is a parametrization of B with six polar caps for the six color charges CC of quarks in a nucleon. The vectors CC point outwards in case energy is deleted from P, if energy is absorbed they point inwards. The polar caps represent geometrical whirls which have other mathematical descriptions than waves. If in the WIGRIS model three quarks with neutral (but exchangeable) r,g,b CC are in a nucleon P, the high school students can show to the observing class their construction in a video WIGRIS rotor S, using spherical coordinates, as a discrete, conical motion. In an explanation by a teacher, mathematical energy integrations (also differentiations) from complex numbers can be added. The gluon exchange in a nucleon between pairs of quarks uses the symmetry of a triangle in WIGRIS S. It acts mostly like a spring, but in WIGRIS S as an inner dynamic for integrating (use the complex residuation theory) energy vectors. The notion of pole (of order 1 for speed and potential, of order 2 for forces as differentiated derivations) or <b>spacetime</b> <b>singularity</b> is appropriate, boundary value problems also. [...] Integrated are two electrical or gravity potentials, two linear or angular momentum, a harmonic oscillation and in addition, using the lever law, the setting of barycenters and a (Schwarzschild) radius of P.

40|$|An {{important}} question in mathematical relativity {{theory is that}} of the nature of <b>spacetime</b> <b>singularities.</b> The equations of general relativity, the Einstein equations, are essentially hyperbolic in nature and the study of <b>spacetime</b> <b>singularities</b> is naturally related to blow-up phenomena for nonlinear hyperbolic systems. These connections are explained and recent progress in applying the theory of hyperbolic equations in this field is presented. A direction which {{has turned out to be}} fruitful is that of constructing large families of solutions of the Einstein equations with singularities of a simple type by solving singular hyperbolic systems. Heuristic considerations indicate, however, that the generic case will be much more complicated and require different techniques. ...|$|R
40|$|Emergent {{gravity is}} based on the Darboux theorem or the Moser lemma in {{symplectic}} geometry stating that the electromagnetic force can always be eliminated by a local coordinate transformation as far as U(1) gauge theory is defined on a spacetime with symplectic structure. In this approach, the spacetime geometry is defined by U(1) gauge fields on noncommutative (NC) spacetime. Accordingly the topology of spacetime is determined by the topology of NC U(1) gauge fields. We show that the topology change of spacetime is ample in emergent gravity and the subsequent resolution of <b>spacetime</b> <b>singularity</b> is possible in NC spacetime. Therefore the emergent gravity approach provides a well-defined mechanism for the topology change of spacetime which does not suffer any <b>spacetime</b> <b>singularity</b> in sharp contrast to general relativity.

Thus, it has surprisingly been found that three-dimensional General Relativity with a constant negative curvature admits black hole solutions with mass and angular momentum [1]. On the other hand, Perry and Teo [2] have shown that the two-dimensional (2 D) string black hole, which appears as an exact solution of the Wess-Zumino-Witten theory, is free of <b>spacetime</b> <b>singularities.</b> This also surprising result is in contrast with the corresponding approximated black hole solution found by imposing the vanishing of the β functions in perturbation theory [3].

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of a <b>spacetime</b> <b>singularity</b> indicates {{the breakdown of}} Einstein gravitation theory in these extreme regimes. We consider here the singularity issue and various black hole paradoxes at classical and quantum levels.

A class of perfect fluid collapse models is constructed which realizes such a possibility. While the pressure could be negative {{in the interior of}} the cloud, the weak energy condition is satisfied. The collapsing star radiates away most of its matter as the process of gravitational collapse evolves, so as to avoid the formation of trapped surfaces and the <b>spacetime</b> <b>singularity.</b> The collapsing interior is matched to an exterior which is a generalized Vaidya spacetime to complete the model.

40|$|Einstein’s field {{equations}} {{in general}} relativity admit {{a variety of}} solutions with <b>spacetime</b> <b>singularities.</b> Numerical relativity has recently revealed the properties of somewhat generic <b>spacetime</b> <b>singularities.</b> It {{has been found that}} in a variety of systems self-similar solutions can describe asymptotic or intermediate behaviour of more general solutions. The typical example is the convergence to an attractor self-similar solution in gravitational collapse. This is closely related to the cosmic censorship violation in the spherically symmetric collapse of a perfect fluid. The self-similar solution also {{plays an important role in}} critical phenomena in gravitational collapse. The critical phenomena are understood as the intermediate behaviour around a critical self-similar solution. We see that the convergence and critical phenomena are understood in a unified manner in terms of attractors of codimension zero and one, respectively, in renormalisation group flow. § 1.

40|$|We {{consider}} AdS/CFT correspondence for time-dependent B backgrounds in this paper. The supergravity solutions we construct are supersymmetric pp-waves on AdS and {{may have}} null singularity in the bulk. The dual gauge theory is also constructed explicitly and is given by a time-dependent supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory living on the boundary. Apart from the usual terms that are dictated by the geometry, our gauge theory action features also a time-dependent axion coupling and a time-dependent gauge coupling. Both of which are necessary due {{to the presence of}} a nontrivial dilaton and axion profile in the supergravity solution. The proposal is supported by a precise matching in the symmetries and functional dependence on the null coordinate of the two theories. As applications, we show how the bulk Einstein equation may be reproduced from the gauge theory. We also study and compare the behaviour of the field theory two-point functions. We find that the two-point function computed by using duality is different from that by doing a direct field theory computation. In particular the <b>spacetime</b> <b>singularity</b> is not seen in our gauge theory result, suggesting that the <b>spacetime</b> <b>singularity</b> may be resolved in the gauge theory.
