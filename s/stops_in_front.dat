An old woman comes tottering by on high pattens, very comfortably and nicely clad. She sees our knapsacks, and instantly <b>stops</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of us, and begins to moan lamentably. Not understanding at first what this means, we ask respectfully if she feels at all ill? [...] "Ah, poor fellows! poor fellows!" [...] she sighs in answer, [...] "obliged to carry all your baggage on your own backs!--very hard! poor lads! very hard, indeed!" [...] And the good old soul goes away groaning over our evil plight, and mumbling something which sounds very like an assurance that she has got no money to give us.|$|E
