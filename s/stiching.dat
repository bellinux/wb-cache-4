The books are not tidy-looking, but they open flat and never fall to pieces. Take a cup of paste; a piece of calico or other cloth, large enough to cover the back and sides of the book; a strip of strong linen--if you can get it, if not, of calico--to cover the back; and abundance of stout cotton or thread. 1st. Paste the strip of linen down the back, and leave the book in the sun or near a fire--but not too near it--to dry, which it will do in half a day. 2ndly. Open the book and look for the place where the <b>stiching</b> is to be seen {{down the middle of the}} pages, or, in other words, for the middle of the sheets; if it be an 8vo. book it will be at every 16th page, if a 12mo. at every 24th page, and so on: it is a mere matter of semi-mechanical reckoning to know where each succeeding stitching is to be found; in this volume the stitching is at pages 216, etc., the interval being 16 pages. Next take the cotton and wind it in between the pages where the stitching is, and over the back round and round, beginning with the first sheet, and going on sheet after sheet until you have reached the last one. 3rdly. Lay the book on the table back upwards, daub it thoroughly with paste, put on the calico cover as neatly as you can, and set it to dry as before; when dry it is complete.|$|E

40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{argues that}} Chinese scholars of the 1920 s and â 30 s (re) interpreted {{the traditions of}} Chinese art {{in order to build}} a modern field of Chinese art history. These scholars faced with challenges such as Chinaâs internal needs to develop, her indirect and direct encounters with Western art and Western ideas, and the influence of modern Japanese scholarship to write art history for a modern nation. This dissertation deals with published art historical texts and a few practices relating to art exhibitions in early twentieth century China. It focuses on a list of writers who have not been well-studied in English or any other European language before. It fills the gap to understand Chinese art and Chinese art circles of the early twentieth century. And it helps {{to draw attention to the}} turning point of Chinese art in the history. Promotor: B.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new, unified technique to perform general edge-sensitive editing operations on n-dimensional images and videos efficiently. The first {{contribution of the}} paper is the introduction of a generalized geodesic distance transform (GGDT), based on soft masks. This provides a unified framework to address several, edgeaware editing operations. Diverse editing tasks such as de-noising and non-photorealistic rendering, are all dealt with fundamentally the same, fast algorithm. Second, a new, geodesic, symmetric filter (GSF) is presented which imposes contrast-sensitive spatial smoothness into segmentation and segmentation-based editing tasks (cutout, object highlightening, colorization, panorama <b>stiching).</b> The effect of the filter is controlled by two intuitive, geometric parameters. In contrast to existing techniques, the GSF filter is applied to real-valued pixel likelihoods (soft masks), thanks to GGDTs and it can be used for both interactive and automatic editing tasks. Complex object topologies are dealt with effortlessly. Finally, the parallelism of GGDTs enables us to exploit modern multi-core CPU architectures as well as powerful new GPUs, thus providing great flexibility of implementation and deployment. Our technique operates on both images and videos, and generalizes naturally to n-dimensional data. The proposed algorithm is validated via quantitative and qualitative comparisons with existing, state of the art approaches. Numerous results on a variety of image and video editing tasks further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method...|$|E

40|$|We {{know that}} {{the basis of a}} survey is always choice, {{selection}} and discretization of the elements. In the case of a geometric transformation, in order to produce a flat representation of the detected surface detected, this smust be approximated to a combination of developable geometric shapes. Having no specific references in the field of architectural survey we can intervene on the basis of similar experiments made by the mapping used to to develope solutions to similar problems. It Is therefore essential to analyze patterns of map projections {{in order to have a}} useful starting point to develop a new projection model to be proposed. We can then synthesize a first list of the various geometric problems and how they might be faced: - When a series of paintings is done on a flat surface, or comparable to it, the simple projection in accordance with the mere seconds the attitude average projection produces a correct image. - If we have a ruled surface this can be developed and then the two-dimensional representation can be obtained by graphical and numerical processing, separately from the three-dimensional model that show a not 'measurable' vision. This possibility is very important, for example, in cases of restoration but also simply for a more complete overview. This is a secure plug-in required different program in the graphics used for the architectural survey. Limited to cylindrical surfaces the development can be made with the software for <b>stiching</b> panoramas. In fact, you run to shoot pictures with the camera positioned with the front nodal point on the axis will and then you obtain geometric, landscape, or a cylindrical projection developed. - The third case is that of non-developable surfaces, such as spherical surfaces or other even more complex. Often we can seek help from stereographic projection used in cartography. All map projections are carried out mainly in two phases: the first project the ellipsoidal surface of the earth of a ruled surface and develop as a cylinder or cone, and the second provides for its development in the plan, other procedures limited project areas directly on a plane. The different analytical techniques-projective possible to respect some parameters useful to the end use of the card. So we have: equivalence, when the area ratio is maintained; Isogon, when retained in the corners, equidistance, when you keep the ratio of distances. Just the equivalence would seem the most appropriate feature to an application for heritage conservation...|$|E
40|$|A {{remarkable}} {{place in}} Estonian folk belief has been occupied by slime fungi Fulgio septica. It has been {{thought to be}} connected with treasure collector or even with witch. This slime fungi is {{the biggest of the}} kind in the world: the receptacle can grow up to 30 cm in diameter. In the folk tradition it is known as puugipask, puugisitt (the shit of treasure bearer) or nõiapask (shit of witch). Its most common color is yellow, but there are other tones as white, or it can be either gray or red. But there are not as many variations as pilvepala (the piece of a cloud). The puugipask is left were the treasure bearer has carried something away. To protect the household against the treasure bearer the mushroom has been burnt, or nailed to the wall or cut with a sharp thing or shot with a gun. The pilvetükid or pilvepalad (the pieces of cloud) is an internationally spread concept known in Estonian, Latvian, Livonian, Votian, Finnish, Swedish and German folk belief. The pilvetükid (the pieces of cloud) is called mushrooms by M. J. Eisen: the mushrooms are almost invisible, but after rain become full of moisture and an appearance resembling jelly. The text leads to algae rather than mushrooms. In most occasions they are slime fungi - usually the specie is called Tremella nostoc, still the determination of the concrete specie is complicated because the pilvepala (the pieces of cloud) has characteristics of different biological species. The notations from Estonia say that the pilvetükid (the pieces of cloud) can be white (Räpina, Põlva), blue (Simuna, Järva-Madise), yellow (Simuna, Kolga-Jaani), gray or green (Võnnu). A single notation says that the the pilvetükid (the pieces of cloud) can be whitish blue, later when growing old it can turn into yellowish tones (Kolga-Jaani). It is obvious that different biological species are known as the pilvetükid (the pieces of cloud). The pilvetükid (the pieces of cloud) are described as follows: it is like jelly (Sangaste), sour milk (Helme), hardened bullion (Puhja), beef jelly (Varbla). The pilvetükid (the pieces of cloud) are considered to be sacred for the origin from the sky - they are taken in as a cure to recover from several diseases such as: malaria, <b>stiching</b> pain, typhoid fever, warts, eczema, constipation; eye diseases can be prevented by washing eyes; they are believed to make giving birth easier. According to the archive data the pilvetükid (the pieces of cloud) can also be good for quarking (Simuna), epilepsy (Simuna), swelling (Vändra), tooth ace (Kõpu). It is believed in Estonia that the pilvetükid (the pieces of cloud) cause rabies. In addition it is connected to the international motif of a patron who feeds wolves...|$|E
40|$|Background: Alzheimer's {{disease is}} a common {{debilitating}} dementia with known heritability, for which 20 late onset susceptibility loci have been identified, but more remain to be discovered. This study sought to identify new susceptibility genes, using an alternative gene-wide analytical approach which tests for patterns of association within genes, in the powerful genome-wide association dataset of the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project Consortium, comprising over 7 m genotypes from 25, 580 Alzheimer's cases and 48, 466 controls. Principal Findings: In addition to earlier reported genes, we detected genome-wide significant loci on chromosomes 8 (TP 53 INP 1, p = 1. 4 × 10 - 6) and 14 (IGHV 1 - 67 p = 7. 9 × 10 - 8) which indexed novel susceptibility loci. Significance: The additional genes identified in this study, have an array of functions previously implicated in Alzheimer's disease, including aspects of energy metabolism, protein degradation and {{the immune system and}} add further weight to these pathways as potential therapeutic targets in Alzheimer's diseaseThe i-Select chips was funded by the French National Foundation on Alzheimer's disease and related disorders.

40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to confirm the {{generalizability}} of the conclusions of the <b>STICH</b> (Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure) trial. BackgroundSurgical ventricular reconstruction (SVR) added to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) did not decrease death or cardiac hospitalization in <b>STICH</b> patients randomized to CABG with (n = 501) or without (n = 499) SVR. MethodsBaseline clinical characteristics of 1, 000 <b>STICH</b> SVR hypothesis patients and 1, 036 STICH-eligible Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) National Cardiac Database patients undergoing CABG plus SVR were entered into a multivariate model equation to predict a mortality that placed these 2, 036 patients in 1 of 32 risk at randomization (RAR) groups. The number of patients in each RAR group profiled the risk of <b>STICH</b> treatment arms and of <b>STICH</b> and STS STICH-eligible patients. ResultsThat 85 % of the 1, 000 <b>STICH</b> patients known to have no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the 2 treatment arms shared the same RAR group suggests that the RAR methodology has sufficient accuracy to compare RAR profiles of <b>STICH</b> and STS patients. RAR group was shared by 1, 522 of 2, 036 <b>STICH</b> and STS STICH-eligible patients (75 %) who underwent CABG plus SVR. Differences in baseline characteristics responsible for more low-risk <b>STICH</b> patients and more high-risk STS patients were modest. Cox proportional hazard ratios of 1, 000 <b>STICH</b> patients in 3 RAR groups suggested by <b>STICH</b> and STS RAR differences showed no differential treatment effect on survival across the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups. ConclusionsThe <b>STICH</b> conclusion of no benefit from adding SVR to CABG applies to a broad spectrum of CABG-eligible patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy.

50|$|<b>Stich</b> {{was born}} in Žehušice in Bohemia. His father was a serf bonded to the estate of Count Joseph Johann von Thun, but <b>Stich</b> was taught singing, violin and finally the horn. The Count sent him to study horn under Joseph Matiegka in Prague, Jan Schindelarz in Munich, and finally with A. J. Hampel in Dresden (from 1763 to 1764). Hampel first taught <b>Stich</b> the hand-stopping {{technique}} which he later improved and extended.|$|R

25|$|Major disjunctives {{within a}} <b>stich</b> are revia qaton (immediately before oleh ve-yored), revia gadol (elsewhere) and tzinnor ({{which looks like}} zarqa). The first (or only) <b>stich</b> in a verse may be divided by dechi, which looks like tifcha but goes under the first letter of the word {{to the right of}} the vowel sign. The last <b>stich</b> in a two- or three-stich verse may be divided by revia megurash, which looks like geresh {{combined}} with revia.|$|R
50|$|An {{objection}} in {{a similar}} line was formulated by Stephen <b>Stich</b> in The Fragmentation of Reason. Reliabilism usually considers that for generating justified beliefs a process needs to be reliable {{in a set of}} relevant possible scenarios. However, according to <b>Stich,</b> these scenarios are chosen in a culturally biased manner. <b>Stich</b> does not defend any alternative theory of knowledge or justification, but instead argues that all accounts of normative epistemic terms are culturally biased and instead only a pragmatic account can be given.|$|R
