5|$|An HDMI {{cable is}} {{composed}} of four shielded twisted pairs, with impedance {{of the order of}} 100Ω (±15%), plus seven separate conductors. HDMI cables with Ethernet differ in that three of the separate conductors instead form an additional <b>shielded</b> <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> (with the CEC/DDC ground as a shield).|$|E
5|$|The D± signals used by low, full, {{and high}} speed are carried over a twisted pair (typically, unshielded) to reduce noise and crosstalk. SuperSpeed uses {{separate}} transmit and receive differential pairs, which additionally require shielding (typically, <b>shielded</b> <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> but twinax is also mentioned by the specification). Thus, to support SuperSpeed data transmission, cables contain {{twice as many}} wires and are thus larger in diameter.|$|E
25|$|Individual {{and overall}} shield (F/FTP, S/FTP, and SF/FTP): Individual {{shielding}} using foil between the twisted pair sets, and also an outer foil and/or braided shielding. Common names: fully <b>shielded</b> <b>twisted</b> <b>pair,</b> screened foiled twisted pair, shielded foiled twisted pair, screened <b>shielded</b> <b>twisted</b> <b>pair,</b> shielded screened twisted pair. This type of shielding helps prevent EMI from entering or exiting the cable and also protects neighboring pairs from crosstalk.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to <b>shielded</b> or foiled <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> (typically F/UTP or S/FTP cable <b>shielding),</b> UTP (unshielded <b>twisted</b> <b>pair)</b> cable is not surrounded by any shielding. UTP {{is the primary}} wire type for telephone usage and is very common for computer networking, especially as patch cables or temporary network connections due to the high flexibility of the cables.|$|R
50|$|Most {{copper wires}} used in data {{communications}} today have eight strands of copper, organized in unshielded <b>twisted</b> <b>pairs,</b> or UTP. The wires are twisted around one another because it reduces electrical interference from outside sources. In addition to UTP, some wires use <b>shielded</b> <b>twisted</b> <b>pairs</b> (STP), which reduce electrical interference even further. The way copper wires are twisted around one another {{also has an}} effect on data rates. Category 3 cable (Cat3), has three to four twists per foot and can support speeds of 10 Mbit/s. Category 5 cable (Cat5) is newer and has three to four twists per inch, which results in a maximum data rate of 100 Mbit/s. In addition, there are category 5e (Cat5e) cables which can support speeds of up to 1,000 Mbit/s, and more recently, category 6 cables (Cat6), which support data rates of up to 10,000 Mbit/s (or 10 Gbit/s).|$|R

25|$|Individual shield (U/FTP): Individual {{shielding}} {{with aluminum}} foil for each twisted pair or quad.

25|$|Because the {{shielding}} {{is made of}} metal, it {{may also}} serve as a ground. Usually a <b>shielded</b> <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> cable has a special grounding wire added called a drain wire which is electrically connected to the shield or screen. The drain wire simplifies connection to ground at the connectors.|$|E
25|$|Overall shield (F/UTP, S/UTP, and SF/UTP): Overall foil, {{braided shield}} or {{braiding}} with foil across {{all of the}} pairs within the 100ohm twisted pair cable. Common names: foiled twisted pair, <b>shielded</b> <b>twisted</b> <b>pair,</b> screened twisted pair. This type of shielding helps prevent EMI from entering or exiting the cable.|$|E
40|$|Crosstalk and {{especially}} far-end crosstalk (FEXT) represents {{the most serious}} source of disturbance in today’s digital transmission systems. It mostly limits the information capacity of current xDSL digital subscriber lines and also of local data networks with unshielded and or <b>shielded</b> <b>twisted</b> <b>pairs</b> (UTP/STP). The elimination of FEXT will require the implementation of advanced methods for its modeling to obtain required predictions of crosstalk behavior in a cable. The standard simple FEXT model and ITU-T FEXT model are not very accurate and do not provide realistic results. That is why a new method for modeling of FEXT was developed and is presented in this paper. The results of the model are also compared with measured characteristics for a typical UTP cable and several other cables. The proposed advanced FEXT model with minor modifications is applicable for any metallic cable to provide accurate and realistic FEXT characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Cryogenic {{engineering}} involves {{design and}} modification of equipment {{that is used}} under boiling point of nitrogen which is 77 K. The focus of this paper {{will be on the}} design of hardware for cryogenic use and a retrofit that was done to the main laboratory cryostat used to test flight components for the Primordial Inflation Polarization Explorer balloon-borne mission. Data from prior tests showed that there was a superfluid helium leak and a total disassemble of the cryostat was conducted in order to localize and fix the leak. To improve efficiency new fill tubes and clamps with modifications were added to the helium tank. Upon removal of the tank, corrosion was found on the flange face that connects to the helium cold plate and therefore had to be fully replaced and copper plated to prevent future corrosion. Indium seals were also replaced for the four fill tubes, a helium level sensor, and the nitrogen and helium tanks. Four additional <b>shielded</b> <b>twisted</b> <b>pairs</b> of cryogenic wire and a wire harness for the Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) were added. Finally, there was also design work done for multiple pieces that went inside the cryostat and a separate probe used to test the SQUIDs. Upon successful completion of the cryostat upgrade, tests were run to check the effectiveness and stability of the upgrades. The post-retrofit tests showed minor leaks were still present and due to this, superfluidity has still not been attained. As such there could still be a possibility of a superfluid leak appearing in the future. Regardless, the copper plating on the helium tank has elongated the need to service it by three to five years...|$|R

40|$|The {{prototype}} of time digitizing {{system for the}} upgrade of BESIII endcap TOF (ETOF) is introduced in this paper. The ETOF readout electronics has a formation of distributed architecture that hit signal from multi-gap resistive plate chamber (MRPC) is signaled as LVDS by front-end electronics (FEE) {{and sent to the}} back-end time digitizing system via long <b>shield</b> differential <b>twisted</b> <b>pair</b> cables. The ETOF digitizing system consists of 2 VME crates each of which contains modules of time digitizing, clock, trigger and fast control etc. The time digitizing module (TDIG) of this prototype can support up to 72 electrical channels of hit information measurement. The fast control (FCTL) module can operate at barrel or endcap mode. The barrel FCTL fans fast control signals from the trigger system out to endcap FCTLs, merges data from endcaps and transfers to the trigger system. Without modifying the barrel TOF structure, this time digitizing architecture benefits for improving ETOF performance without degrading barrel TOF measuring. Lab experiments show that the time resolution of this digitizing system can be less than 20 ps, and the data throughput to DAQ can be about 92 Mbps. Beam experiments show that the complete time resolution can be less than 45 ps...|$|R
