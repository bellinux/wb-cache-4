Beat him again, and put him back in until he was burnt alive. I did nothing to stop it. I <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have brandished my weapon or shot in the air, but I was not {{inclined}} to do so. Does that make me an accomplice to murder?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, future First Lady Hillary Clinton {{said during}} a 60 Minutes {{interview}} either [...] "I'm not sitting here as some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette". or [...] "I'm not sitting here like some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette". (The end of this quotation has also appeared as [...] "some little woman, standing by my man and baking cookies, like Tammy Wynette." [...] However, the reference to cookie baking more likely comes from an unrelated remark by Hillary Clinton: [...] "I <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided {{to do was to}} fulfill my profession which I entered before my husband was in public life.") The remark set off a firestorm of controversy. Wynette wrote to Clinton, saying, [...] "With all that is in me, I resent your caustic remark. I believe you have offended every true country-music fan and every person who has made it on their own with no one to take them to the White House." [...] Clinton then called to apologize after she saw the large negative reaction she received, and asked Wynette to perform at a fundraiser. Wynette agreed to do so.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{replied the}} girl; [...] "in a way it's worse than that. I <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> go--somewhere--but there's Mrs. Marvin and Elsie." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> My {{words had}} evidently {{completely}} upset Mr. Stillwell.|$|R
6000|$|... "No!" [...] she said, [...] "I am not {{reminding}} you of {{that because}} I want anything from you, but listen. <b>Supposing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> help you out again? <b>Supposing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> give you something for your paper which would produce the greatest sensation which New York has ever known? Would you promise to realize at any loss, and give it up? Leave America altogether and go to Europe?" ...|$|R
60|$|I said (glancing at Joe, {{who stood}} looking on, motionless), that <b>I</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> come directly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> learn much. She {{was always}} a pig-headed, stiff-necked creature. I am sure it wouldn't be any {{pleasure}} to me to see her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> if I tried, but I don't {{want to do}} it," [...] said Gwendolen, rather pettishly; and {{her mother}} was afraid to say more.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do you <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{speak to}} her?' It {{had come into}} my mind to ask her why she had inquired of me whether I should {{recognise}} Mr. Porterfield.|$|E
6000|$|... "Alas! Peregrine, <b>supposing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{do it in}} good faith, {{would you}} become a mere tricksy sprite, {{a thing of the}} elements, and yield up your hopes as a Christian soul, a child of God and heir of Heaven?" ...|$|R
60|$|HIGGINS. You {{never asked}} yourself, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> whether <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do without YOU.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am quite}} sure your {{feelings}} {{are what they}} ought to be. And for myself, if I ever were,--that is to say, <b>supposing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be in any way interested--. But perhaps it is premature to make any suggestion on that head at present." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Mr. Brown; I {{wanted to}} hear the news. You didn't <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> go to bed without it," [...] she replied calmly, though she was {{trembling}} with eagerness.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's true, but it doesn't excuse me. I {{ought to}} be a power in the firm, and I don't <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> even keep one of its books properly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I {{could study}} if someone read {{and did the}} eye part. Do you <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> by and by?" [...] he asked, with a sudden ray of hope.|$|E
6000|$|He saw, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{not help}} {{smiling at the}} {{simplicity}} of this reply; and added, with a smile upon his own ingenuous face: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was uphill work, but {{the peasants}} I had helped began to trust me, {{thoughtful}} men gave me their support, and some joined because they hated all in authority. I was becoming an influence, {{and it was}} <b>supposed</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be bought. Petty honors were offered and an official post. When {{it was found that}} these things did not tempt me, I became a danger to the State." ...|$|R

6000|$|Her face flamed with color--all her sullen {{restraint}} vanished, all her girlish charm came back. [...] "Oh, do {{you think}} so? Do you <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get him to teach me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Irene {{threw her}} arms round her. [...] "Oh, it was a SPLENDID call! I didn't <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make it go off so well. We talked nearly the whole time about you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{speak to}} her?" [...] It {{had come into}} my mind to ask her why {{she had wanted to}} know of me if I should {{recognise}} Mr. Porterfield.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{question}} you wished to ask me," [...] Captain Bayley said, [...] "was, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> whether <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{give you any}} clue as to who was the woman you took in, and whose child you adopted? She was my daughter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, indeed, indeed, I'm thankful I'm not going, Mr. Bushell!" [...] Mrs. Baker said. [...] "And <b>I</b> wouldn't have <b>supposed</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be, I'm so homesick. I'm {{going up}} the river {{on a visit to}} mother; but if I was going {{straight}} back, I wouldn't take your two thousand dollars for the half of it. I would be afraid of losing it, or getting robbed and murdered. I don't know what wouldn't happen. I would be happy to oblige you, but indeed, indeed I couldn't!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing of the kind," [...] {{retorted}} Sammy. [...] "I simply {{mean that}} nobody can do everything, and that very often two heads are better than one. It struck me that you had something on your mind, and I thought I {{might be able to}} help you get rid of it. But of course, if you don't want my help, <b>supposing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> and would give it to you, that is an end of the matter, and I guess I'll be on my way. The Old Briar-patch is rather a dull place anyway." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I were a Sherlock Holmes," [...] said Jessie, [...] "I <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{have told}} you were a colonial from little things like that. But anyhow, I guessed it, didn't I?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't it! I've been {{thinking}} about that lode for twenty years, and do you <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> let another man locate it? Besides, we must stake three claims on the best frontage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want to send}} {{a message}} south," [...] said Mr. Oliver, writing {{something}} on a form. [...] "It's a code address. I <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get an answer in an hour or so?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{must pay}} it somehow, <b>I</b> <b>supposed,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{not bear to}} hand over two {{shilling}} pieces into Lucretia's outstretched palm. It was desecration, it was sheer sacrilege. But Lucretia took the half-dollar with the utmost calmness, {{and went out to}} order the sleigh.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} a happier man if you were {{provided}} for as is Miss Oriel. <b>Suppose,</b> now, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> give you up to a rich man who {{would be able to}} insure you against all wants?" ...|$|R
6000|$|MISS GALBRAITH, indignantly: [...] "How can you insult me by <b>supposing</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{be jealous}} {{of such a}} perfect little goose as that? No, Allen! Whatever I think of you, I still respect you too much for that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What a question, Maud! Do you <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{stand up}} before a {{minister}} of God, and plight my faith {{to a man}} I did not love?--Why have you seemed to doubt it?" ...|$|E
60|$|If I {{live to be}} {{nine hundred}} and ninety-nine years old I don't <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ever forget that walk. I, remember, it about as keenly as the chagrin I {{suffered}} on another occasion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you <b>suppose</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{get them}} to get any?" [...] {{questioned}} Tomlinson. [...] "Would it be all right to telephone down to the office, {{or do you think}} it would be better to ring?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't interrupt," [...] she begged. [...] "I am seeking for an inspiration. In {{my younger}} days I used to trim hats. <b>I</b> don't <b>suppose</b> {{anything}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{do would be}} of any use here, but one must try everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Young enough; {{but it was}} thought, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> light a pipe. We {{were seven}} when we left Naples, all picked men; but I {{was the only one}} who was in Paraguay with M. de Sidonia, and that was nearly the end of our travels, which lasted five years.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not so," [...] {{answered}} Benoni. [...] "I will swear the oath, though {{indeed it}} is needless. Why should you <b>suppose</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> wish to force this maid into any marriage, or to work her evil on account of matters of her faith?" ...|$|R
