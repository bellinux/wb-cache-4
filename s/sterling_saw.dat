60|$|Mrs. <b>Sterling</b> <b>saw</b> {{the shadow}} that crept into Christie's face, {{and led the}} chat to cheerful things, not saying much herself, but beguiling the other to talk, and {{listening}} with an interest that {{made it easy to}} go on.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. <b>Sterling</b> <b>saw</b> {{these changes}} with her wise, motherly eyes, but said nothing; for she {{influenced}} others by the silent power of character. Speaking little, and unusually gifted with the meditative habits of age, {{she seemed to}} live in a more peaceful world than this. As George MacDonald somewhere says, [...] "Her soul seemed to sit apart in a sunny little room, safe from dust and noise, serenely regarding passers-by through the clear muslin curtains of her window." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sterling</b> Software <b>saw</b> Informatics General as a {{possible}} acquisition, but Informatics management decided it {{did not want to}} be acquired, and especially not by Sterling Software. [...] On April 15, 1985, Sterling offered $25 per share for Informatics, then when that was rejected by the Informatics board, on April 22 increased the offer to $26 per share.|$|R
5000|$|... "The second <b>Sterling</b> session <b>saw</b> {{the birth}} of one of Hank's trademarks, the [...] "crack" [...] rhythm: an {{electric}} guitar keeping time on the deadened bass strings. Without drums in his lineup, Hank used the electric guitar to emphasize the pulse. It was the sound that Johnny Cash later made into a trademark, adding a little rhythmic flourish to make 'boom-chicka-boom.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|Nicknamed [...] "The Zipzip Man" [...] Ella was {{a member}} of Parramatta's star studded backlines of the early 1980s, playing {{alongside}} Brett Kenny, Mick Cronin, Peter Sterling and Eric Grothe. It was only the presence of Five-eight Kenny and the partnership he had with [...] <b>Sterling</b> that <b>saw</b> Ella play most of his first grade games in the centres where he formed the NSWRL premiership's most lethal centre pairing alongside Cronin.|$|R
25|$|After three barren {{years of}} total United States domination, Team Europe finally overcame the odds in November 2003 {{to lift the}} hallowed Weber Cup for the first time. It was a total triumph for captain Tomas Leandersson, who led from the front for all three days, putting in a <b>sterling</b> {{performance}} that <b>saw</b> his side over the line.|$|R
50|$|Norwegian {{designation}} for the Colt M1917 (mentioned in {{the following}} section) in 7.92 mm, used as the standard HMG and anti-aircraft weapon for the Norwegian Army from 1929 to 1940. The M/29 replaced the Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun in Norwegian service. In all, 1,800 M/29s were in Norwegian service {{by the time of}} the 9 April 1940 German invasion. The M/29 <b>saw</b> <b>sterling</b> service in the 1940 Norwegian Campaign, often deployed as the only heavy weapon of Norwegian front line units.|$|R
5000|$|During {{his time}} at Capitol, Marino {{mastered}} such classics as The Beatles 7" [...] single of Hey Jude and John Lennon & Plastic Ono Band's Live Peace in Toronto 1969. When Capitol Records closed its New York studio in 1971, Marino joined the fledgling Record Plant, eventually becoming {{a partner in the}} mastering business of the Record Plant called the Master Cutting Room, which was on West 44th Street in Manhattan. [...] There he became established with projects such as Don McLean’s American Pie, Alice Cooper's Billion Dollar Babies, Gregg Allman's Laid Back, and Stevie Wonder's Talking Book and Innervisions. Lee Hulko, one of the owners of <b>Sterling</b> Sound, <b>saw</b> Marino's success and asked him to come work at Sterling, however Marino did not say yes immediately. After Chris Stone, the owner of the Record Plant went to LA, Marino had more management duties and he felt it distracted him from his mastering work. Eventually, Marino took Hulko up on his offer and he headed to Sterling Sound in 1973 to work in a room that Hulko had built for him.|$|R
2500|$|... 1986 <b>saw</b> <b>Sterling</b> almost carry a clean {{sweep of}} the major awards – except the Rothmans Medal – and win the inaugural Clive Churchill Medal in Parramatta's fourth Grand Final victory, {{reversing}} the 1984 result with a 4-2 win over Canterbury-Bankstown to send the retiring Mick Cronin and team captain Ray Price out as premiership winners. 1986 also saw the Parramatta with their own home ground {{for the first time}} since over-excited fans had burned down the old Cumberland Oval grandstand during the 1981 Grand Final celebrations. Between 1982 and 1985 the club was forced to play home games at Canterbury-Bankstown's home ground, the Belmore Sports Ground, but in 1986 the new Parramatta Stadium was opened by Queen Elizabeth II and Sterling set about making the venue his own personal playground.|$|R
60|$|It was in {{this summer}} of 1834,--month of May, shortly after {{arriving}} in London,--that I first <b>saw</b> <b>Sterling's</b> Father. A stout broad gentleman of sixty, perpendicular in attitude, rather showily dressed, and of gracious, ingenious and slightly elaborate manners. It was at Mrs. Austin's in Bayswater; he was just taking leave as I entered, so our interview lasted only a moment: but {{the figure of the}} man, as Sterling's father, had already an interest for me, and I remember the time well. Captain Edward Sterling, as we formerly called him, had now quite dropt the military title, nobody even of his friends now remembering it; and was known, according to his wish, in political and other circles, as Mr. Sterling, a private gentleman of some figure. Over whom hung, moreover, a kind of mysterious nimbus as the principal or one of the principal writers in the Times, which gave an interesting chiaroscuro to his character in society. A potent, profitable, but somewhat questionable position; of which, though he affected, and sometimes with anger, altogether to disown it, and rigorously insisted on the rights of anonymity, he was not unwilling to take the honors too: the private pecuniary advantages were very undeniable; and his reception in the Clubs, and occasionally in higher quarters, was a good deal modelled on the universal belief in it.|$|R
50|$|Outside polesitter Dale Earnhardt led {{the opening}} lap {{for the first}} time in his Daytona 500 career. Lap 3 <b>saw</b> <b>Sterling</b> Marlin in the Morgan-McClure Motorsports No. 4 car take the lead. The first yellow flag came out on lap 10 when Joe Nemechek (in his first race for his own team) crashed and {{collected}} Brett Bodine. Two laps after the restart, IMSA and IndyCar veteran Davy Jones touched with fellow rookie Randy LaJoie exiting turn 4, clipping the wall and spinning the Jasper Motorsports No. 77 car into the pits. Before 30 laps were put on the board, sprint car king Steve Kinser crashed with Phil Parsons. Jeff Gordon took the lead from Marlin during the yellow flag pit stops. After the restart, Mark Martin and 1985 and 1987 winner Bill Elliott stopped for flat tires. On lap 43, John Andretti and 1990 winner Derrike Cope collided exiting turn 2. Both drivers continued with minimal damage, but as Cope came through the tri-oval to catch up to the field, both rear tires suddenly blew out, sending him into a harmless spin but rendering his car disabled as he could get no traction with both rear tires flat. On lap 58, Mike Wallace got loose in turn 2 and tagged Jeff Purvis, sending both cars into the wall and the 1994 and 1993 ARCA 200 winners respectively were finished for the day. Caution flag pit stops resulted in Dave Marcis staying out to lead one lap (a regular practice for Dave), and Mark Martin's Roush Racing crew placed his car in front. On lap 68, Gordon retook the lead.|$|R
50|$|Opposing props Rod Morris and Newtown's Steve Bowden clashed in {{an early}} tackle, {{following}} an errant elbow from Bowden, and punches were thrown. In the ensuing melee, Lewis sought out Terry Lamb {{and gave him a}} rugged welcome to interstate football with a number of uppercuts. After 7 minutes of play, the next scrum erupted into a brawl with Bowden and Morris singled out by referee Kevin Steele as the chief instigators, with both then sent to the sin-bin for 10 minutes (though replays indicated that Morris had done most of the punching with Bowden unusually restrained) with NSW receiving a penalty. In that period the Blues raced to a 15-0 lead thanks to their Parramatta connection of Peter Sterling, Ray Price, Eric Grothe and Mick Cronin, with Price and Sterling setting up one try for Grothe and another for Cronin (all four players would later that year feature in the Eels' inaugural premiership victory). This was the second of Grothe's tries for the game, the first came after 13 minutes when he swooped upon a wayward pass by Maroons' hooker Greg Conescu and raced 95-metres down the touchline, easily out pacing his opposite number Mitch Brennan and Qld halfback Ross Henrick before busting through the cover defending tackles of Brad Backer (coming from the opposite wing) and Colin Scott to score in the corner to give the Blues a 5-0 lead after Cronin's sideline conversion. Backer's tackle had actually caused Grothe to fall and he looked to have stopped less than half a metre short, but Scott's subsequent effort hitting the Blues winger as he hit the ground actually dragged him over the line for the try. Soon after Price sent Sterling through a big gap in the defence and he found Cronin backing up on his outside to score. After Cronin converted his own try NSW led 10-0 after just 16 minutes. Grothe scored his second try moments later after Henrick was penalised for not retiring behind a scrum. A simple run-around move <b>saw</b> <b>Sterling</b> pass to price Price who sent his winger bursting through a weak Chris Phelan tackle to score under the posts.|$|R
