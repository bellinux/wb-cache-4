The control instability during the transition regions between different control modes {{as well as the}} problems in tuning the control loop(s) involving processes of different dynamic parameters are among the major difficulties when utilizing AHU <b>sequencing</b> <b>control</b> strategies in applications. A three PIs split-range <b>sequencing</b> <b>control</b> strategy with 'freezing' and gain scheduling schemes (SRFG) is developed addressing these problems.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a strategy for}} improving the reliability and the energy efficiency of chiller <b>sequencing</b> <b>control</b> based on the total cooling load measurement of centralized multiple centrifugal chiller plants. The improvement is achieved as follows. Firstly, a fused measurement of building cooling load is used to replace the direct/indirect measurement.

Thirdly, the online computed maximum cooling capacity is calibrated according {{to the quality of}} the fused measurement in order to deal with the possible misbehaviours in measurement instruments. A simplified model for computing the maximum cooling capacity is developed and validated using field data.

40|$|IEEE Xplore link: [URL] fully rated {{converter}} of type 4 {{wind turbines}} {{is capable of}} providing dynamic voltage control during grid faults by injecting controlled reactive currents. This paper describes three different dynamic voltage control options during unbalanced grid faults: 1) the positive <b>sequence</b> voltage <b>control</b> with only a positive sequence reactive current injection and suppression of the negative sequence current; 2) the positive <b>sequence</b> voltage <b>control</b> with limitation of the positive sequence reactive current injection and suppression of the negative sequence current; and 3) {{the positive and negative}} <b>sequence</b> voltage <b>control</b> with both a positive and a negative sequence reactive current injection. These different control options are compared in simulations of a wind power plant connected to a meshed power system, including synchronous generators. It is shown that both the positive <b>sequence</b> voltage <b>control</b> with limitation and the positive and negative <b>sequence</b> voltage <b>control</b> can overcome the voltage rise and voltage distortion that can occur with pure positive <b>sequence</b> voltage <b>control</b> without limitation.

40|$|Chiller <b>sequencing</b> <b>control</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in achieving air-conditioning system energy efficiency since chillers usually account for major part of system overall energy consumption in commercial buildings. This paper compares and evaluates the in situ performances of three commonly used chiller <b>sequencing</b> <b>control</b> strategies. These three control strategies are operating online in parallel on a management and communication platform in a super high-rise building in Hong Kong. The comparison and evaluation focus on the perspectives of chiller switch number, electrical peak demand and overall energy consumption in one week. Meanwhile, the different impacts of two systematic errors (i. e. positive errors which cause direct measurement larger than true value and negative errors which cause measurement smaller than true value) on each control strategy are also analyzed. The performance comparison demonstrates that the strategy, using fused cooling load measurement, achieved the best performance. The applications of the online computed chiller maximum cooling capacity and the advanced data fusion technique, which removes the negative impacts of sensor measurement uncertainties, can significantly improve the performance of chiller <b>sequencing</b> <b>control.</b> Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

50|$|To {{modulate}} the reactivity between monomer {{and growing}} polymeric chain is another approach to enhance <b>sequence</b> <b>control.</b> The rationale for {{this method is}} that monomer has to be activated with first catalyst at beginning as a dormant species, which could then participate into polymerization as the second catalyst is introduced.

Examples with up to six customer classes, using Poisson arrival and service processes, are presented. The fluid heuristic does well at <b>sequencing</b> <b>control</b> but the diffusion gives additional, and better, information on input control.

Location 5 is expected to contain a standard subroutine entry instruction pair (73 LINK : 40 N - see above), allowing the pre-interrupt execution address (still in the SCR) to be saved for later return.
