50|$|The {{remoteness}} and inaccessibility of a {{large part}} of the park has allowed some of the more sensitive animals to remain largely undisturbed. A large number of fauna have been catalogued in the park including some that were previously thought to be extinct. Some of the more common animals include: barking and sooty owls, eastern grey kangaroos, frogs, pademelons, cockatoos, rosellas, kookaburras, bats and echidnas. It supports a globally important population of rufous <b>scrub-birds,</b> as well as flame robins, pale-yellow robins, paradise riflebirds, green catbirds, regent bowerbirds and Australian logrunners.|$|E
50|$|Werrikimbe is {{the habitat}} {{of at least}} 22 {{threatened}} animal species.

40|$|The diet of {{nestling}} noisy <b>scrub-birds,</b> Atrichornis clamosus, {{was determined}} from observations at 12 nests and from examination of 718 faecal sacs. Nestlings were fed invertebrates of 18 orders {{plus a few}} small vertebrates. There {{was no significant difference}} in the proportions of the various taxa as determined from observational and faecal sac data. The most common prey from the combined data were Araneida (35 %), Orthoptera (29 %), larvae (13 %), Blattodea (7 %), Hymenoptera (4 %), Chilopoda (3 %), and Lumbricidae (2 %). There were significant differences between the proportions of the main prey items between years, within years and within territories. There were no significant differences in the type of prey fed at different ages. The data suggest that the female noisy scrub-bird is a generalist predator when feeding her young...|$|E
40|$|The Endangered Noisy Scrub-bird {{is a small}} {{passerine}} that {{is seldom}} seen but often heard in its range on the south coast of Western Australia. The difficulties in observing this cryptic bird mean that {{little is known about}} its social system. The loud, conspicuous territorial song of the male provides a convenient, non-intrusive means by which to study this species. The aim of this project was to investigate the patterns of song sharing and repertoire change in the Noisy Scrub-bird to provide indications of the social structure. It was found that groups of up to ten territorial males shared the same set of about five song types. Song groups were discrete, with members of a song group sharing most, if not all, of their song types. Males from different song groups had no song types in common. Repertoire change was rapid and, {{with the exception of one}} individual, was found in every territorial male studied in the Mt Gardner population. It occurred simultaneously in all members of a song group, with males making the same changes to their shared songs. The source of repertoire change was mainly modification of existing song types with occasional divergence of a single song type into two distinct song types, as well as some innovation providing new song types. The average life of a song type was approximately 6 months. Although some song types persisted for the entire 16 month sampling period, they were continually modified and a year later could no longer be recognised as the same type. Translocation of eight male <b>scrub-birds</b> to the Porongurup National Park provided an opportunity to combine individuals that initially did not share any songs. This allowed the process of song group formation to be studied. Within a one to two month period these males altered their songs so that they shared with their new neighbours. There was some evidence that the songs of dominant males were copied. Observation of the population established on Bald Island by translocation confirmed that there were no appreciable long-term effects on the songs of translocated Noisy <b>Scrub-birds.</b> Song group size, repertoire size and levels of song sharing were very similar to those found in the Mt Gardner population. The striking feature of Noisy Scrub-bird song groupings was their discreteness and cohesiveness even in the presence of continual repertoire change. It is suggested that each song group consists of a dominant male whose songs are more attractive to females and/or effective in territory defence. This dominant male is surrounded by subordinate males that copy his effective songs. Repertoire change can be explained by the dominant male continually making changes to his songs, with the other males copying these changes to retain their mimicked effectiveness. Each song group may in fact represent a dispersed lek. The scenario suggested to explain Noisy Scrub-bird song groupings bears striking similarities to the hotshot hypothesis to explain lek formation whereby males cluster around a successful male. This study demonstrates the potential of using song to investigate aspects of the social system of a species which is otherwise very difficult to observe. Management of an Endangered species such as the Noisy Scrub-bird will always benefit from increased knowledge about their social system. For example, this study showed that taking males from different song groups for translocation probably has little impact on their success at the new site because of their ability to rapidly alter their songs to form new song groups. An additional benefit of regularly monitoring the songs of translocated males was that it allowed ongoing identification of individuals, even though their songs were continually changing...|$|E

40|$|The Noisv <b>Scrub-bird</b> Atrichornis clamosus {{is a small}} semi-flightless {{inhabitant}} {{of dense}} scrubs and low forests on the south coast of Western Australia. Between 1961, when the species was rediscovered (Webster 1962) and 1976, A. clamosus was largely confined to the Mt. Gardner area of the Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve 40 km east of Albany (Smith 1985 a). As a result of habitat management (fire exclusion) and translocation of birds to new sites the population index of the species (determined {{as the number of}} singing males) had increased from 45 in 1970 to 290 in 1990, and the range spread over about 30 km of coastal and near coastal land (Danks 1991). The population remains vulnerable to wildfire however, and the species is still classified as endangered (Garnett 1992). Knowledge of the dietary requirements of A. clamosus is important in developing a-better understanding of its ecological needs, for managing its habitat and in selecting release areas for the translocation program. John Gilbert, who discovered A. clamosus in 1842 recorded that the stomach contents of specimens he collected consisted of 'Coleoptera and seeds' (quoted in Whittell 1951). The naturalist William Webb. who also took specimens of A. clamosus in the Albany area between 1875 and 1889, considered the bird's food to consist of 'small beetles and other small insects' (Whittell 1943, quoting Webb 1895). Field observations in the Mt. Gardner area in the 1970 s showed that A. clamosus is a predominantly terrestrial insectivore foraging in leaf litter, decayed wood and among shrubs and sedges (Smith 1985 b). Observations of prey fed to nestlings and analysis of faecal sacs removed from the nest by the female provided information on the diet of nestlings (Smith & Robinson 1976; Smith & Calver 1984). In the latter study, it was found that nestlings were fed a variety of invertebrates from 19 orders plus a few small vertebrates. The most common prey were Araneida (35...|$|R
5000|$|Exemplifying both Jackson's prose {{style and}} his {{approach}} to his work, the following extract (omitting references to other works and illustrations) is from his coverage of the rufous <b>scrub-bird</b> Atrichornis rufescens - then Atrichia rufescens:This set of eggs {{is the only one}} known to science, and its discovery was the means of putting in the [...] "keystone" [...] to the oological arch in Australia. It is the first discovered, and still remains so. So the missing link has at last been found. During my visit to the scrubs of the rich Don Dorrigo country, in the Upper Bellenger River district of New South Wales, in October of 1898, I had some most interesting experiences, and paid special attention to the Atrichia during my stay, and was particularly bent on finding its nest and eggs, and lost no opportunities of following it whenever I heard its very shrill and penetrating note. They are exceedingly shy birds, and hide very suddenly, and like a mouse they crawl under some big log, or into a mass of dead leaves, sticks, and bushes, and thus dodge a person beautifully. They frequent parts of the scrub where it is damp and dense, and almost impossible for a man to get through, and appear to be quite terrestrial in their habits. On October 20, of 1898, a party consisting of four, including myself, left camp at 8 a.m., after enjoying a good breakfast of damper and curried Wonga Pigeon. We then entered the scrub at about 600 yards from the camp, when almost immediately we heard the noisy Spine-tailed Orthonyxes crying out in all parts. Suddenly one flew from a nest which was built {{at the foot of a}} tree. About three feet from this nest was a tuft of long green stiff grass (Cyperaceae sp.), out of which immediately after the Orthonyx flew the Atrichia. We all rushed over, and found it contained two fresh eggs, and there was no doubt about them being those of the Atrichia, considering we all saw the bird fly from the nest. We then lay down concealed in the ferns and undergrowth, in the scrub, for nearly four hours, with gun ready, waiting for the return of Mrs. Atrichia, but it was all for nothing, not the slightest sight of the bird being obtained. It seems very remarkable that the female Atrichia has not yet been captured; all specimens so far obtained have been males, with the exception of one, which was caught at the nest at Booyong, near Lismore, N.S.W., and a description of which I will give in this data. I shot eleven at various times, and when I have dropped across them in pairs, yet on dissection they all proved to be male birds.|$|R
