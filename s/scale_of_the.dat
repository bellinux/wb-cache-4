5|$|A {{large number}} of {{soldiers}} {{who died in the}} war were never found, and similarly bodies were recovered that could not be identified; once again, this required new forms of memorial. The <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> issue was once again huge: 73,000 Allied dead were never found at the Somme, for example, either because their bodies had been lost, destroyed or were unrecognisable, more than one in ten of the losses in the battle.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> damage became clear, the {{government}} of Yemen requested for assistance from the international community. The hardest hit areas had poor infrastructure, which caused difficulties in communications as relief goods were distributed. Nations in the region, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, sent money and supplies to help rebuild the damaged infrastructure and houses. Agencies under the United Nations provided food and logistical support. Relief efforts continued to make progress until 2011 due to a political uprising in Yemen.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> escape {{rate from}} piecewise-linear dynamical systems displaying intermittency due to <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> an indifferent fixed-point.

5|$|Eight {{months were}} spent {{scouting}} locations, including Ireland, China and Argentina, before New Zealand, Prague, Slovenia and Poland were chosen.

The main problem of the building was its size.
