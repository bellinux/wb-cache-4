5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of dengue is typically made clinically, {{on the basis}} of reported symptoms and physical examination; this applies especially in endemic areas. However, early disease can be difficult to differentiate from other viral infections. A probable diagnosis is based on the findings of fever plus two of the following: nausea and vomiting, rash, generalized pains, low white blood cell count, positive tourniquet test, or any warning sign (see table) in someone who lives in an endemic area. Warning signs typically occur before the onset of severe dengue. The tourniquet test, which is particularly useful in settings where no laboratory investigations are readily available, involves the application of a blood pressure cuff at between the diastolic and <b>systolic</b> <b>pressure</b> for five minutes, followed by the counting of any petechial hemorrhages; a higher number makes a {{diagnosis of}} dengue more likely with the cut off being more than 10 to 20 per 1inch2 (6.25cm2).|$|E

Design A prospective 15 years follow-up study. Patients A series of 446 consecutive coronary bypass surgery patients, operated on between April 1976 and April 1977. According to their <b>systolic</b> blood <b>pressure,</b> patients were divided into five groups. Main outcome measures <b>Systolic</b> blood <b>pressure</b> 5 years after surgery, but not pre-operative <b>systolic</b> blood <b>pressure,</b> was an independent predictor of cardiac mortality. Results Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that pre-operative <b>systolic</b> blood <b>pressure</b> was not associated with cardiac mortality, while higher <b>systolic</b> blood <b>pressure</b> 1 year after surgery showed a trend towards increased cardiac mortality. <b>Systolic</b> blood <b>pressure</b> 5 years after surgery appeared to be a strong independent predictor of cardiac mortality during the subsequent follow-up period. Patients with a <b>systolic</b> blood <b>pressure</b> of 130 — 139 mmHg had the lowest risk. Compared to this group, the cardiac mortality risk in patients with a <b>systolic</b> blood <b>pressure</b> 5 years after surgery of 140 - 149 mmHg, 150 — 159 mmHgand> 160 mmHg, was 2 - 3 (1 - 2 to 4 - 6), 3 - 4 (1 - 6 to 71) and 31 (1 - 4 to 6 - 5) times higher. <b>Systolic</b> blood <b>pressure</b> < 130 mmHg 5 years after surgery was also associ-ated with a 2 - 3 times (11 to 4 - 7) times increased risk for cardiac mortality, compared to patients with a <b>systolic</b> blood <b>pressure</b> of 130 - 139 mmHg.

40|$|Objectives To {{investigate}} whether exercise-induced hypertension in successfully repaired adult post-coarctectomy patients {{is associated with}} hypertension on 24 -h blood pressure measurement and increased left ventricular mass. Methods One hundred and forty-four consecutive postcoarctectomy patients (mean age 31. 5 years, range 17 - 74 years; mean age at repair 7. 9 years, range 0 - 45 years) from three tertiary referral centres were studied using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, treadmill exercise testing and echocardiography. Results Of the 144 patients, 27 (19 %) were known to have sustained hypertension, based on their history, and all were on antihypertensive medication. However, 32 (27 %) of the remaining 117 patients showed elevated mean daytime <b>systolic</b> blood <b>pressure</b> readings at 24 -h ambulatory blood <b>pressure</b> monitoring (<b>systolic</b> blood <b>pressure</b> {{greater than or equal}} to 140 mmHg). Of the remaining 85 patients with normal mean daytime <b>systolic</b> blood <b>pressure,</b> 18 patients (21 %) had exercise-induced hypertension (maximal exercise <b>systolic</b> blood <b>pressure</b> > 200 mmHg). Mean daytime <b>systolic</b> blood <b>pressure</b> was higher in the exercise-induced hypertensive patients compared to the normotensive patients with normal exercise blood pressure (1134 +/- 5 versus 129 +/- 7 mmHg, P = 0. 008). By multivariate analysis, both maximal exercise <b>systolic</b> blood <b>pressure</b> (P = 0. 007) and resting <b>systolic</b> blood <b>pressure</b> (P < 0. 0001) were independently associated with mean daytime <b>systolic</b> blood <b>pressure.</b> Maximal exercise <b>systolic</b> blood <b>pressure</b> had no independent predictive value for left ventricular mass (P = 0. 132).

Methods An increased interarm <b>systolic</b> blood <b>pressure</b> difference was defined as ≥ 10 mm Hg using the average of initial and repeat blood pressure measurements obtained in both arms. Participants were followed through 2010 for incident cardiovascular disease events. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to investigate the effect of interarm <b>systolic</b> blood <b>pressure</b> difference on incident cardiovascular disease. Results We examined 3390 (56. 3 % female) participants aged 40 years and older, free of cardiovascular disease at baseline, mean age of 61. 1 years, who attended a FHS examination between 1991 and 1994 (original cohort) and from 1995 to 1998 (offspring cohort). The mean absolute interarm <b>systolic</b> blood <b>pressure</b> difference was 4. 6 mm Hg (range 0 - 78). Increased interarm <b>systolic</b> blood <b>pressure</b> difference was present in 317 (9. 4 %) participants. The median follow-up time was 13. 3 years, during which time 598 participants (17. 6 %) experienced a first cardiovascular event, including 83 (26. 2 %) participants with interarm <b>systolic</b> blood <b>pressure</b> difference ≥ 10 mm Hg. Compared with those with normal interarm <b>systolic</b> blood <b>pressure</b> difference, participants with an elevated interarm <b>systolic</b> blood <b>pressure</b> difference were older (63. 0 years vs 60. 9 years), had a greater prevalence of diabetes mellitus (13. 3 % vs 7. 5 %,), higher <b>systolic</b> blood <b>pressure</b> (136. 3 mm Hg vs 129. 3 mm Hg), and a higher total cholesterol level (212. 1 mg/dL vs 206. 5 mg/dL). Interarm <b>systolic</b> blood <b>pressure</b> difference {{was associated with a}} significantly increased hazard of incident cardiovascular events in the multivariable adjusted model (hazard ratio 1. 38; 95 % CI, 1. 09 - 1. 75). For each 1 -SD-unit increase in absolute interarm <b>systolic</b> blood <b>pressure</b> difference, the hazard ratio for incident cardiovascular events was 1. 07 (95 % CI, 1. 00 - 1. 14) in the fully adjusted model.

METHODS AND RESULTS: This study was embedded in the Leiden 85 -plus Study, an observational population-based prospective study. All 90 -year-old participants (n = 267) were included between 2002 and 2004 and followed up for mortality for at least 5 years. Differences in mortality risks were compared between participants with low <b>systolic</b> blood <b>pressure</b> ( 150 mmHg) within strata of low NT-proBNP (< 284 pg/mL for women and < 306 pg/mL for men = lowest tertile) vs. high NT-proBNP (middle and highest tertile) at age 90 years. During maximal follow-up of 7. 2 years, 212 participants (79 %) died. Among participants with low NT-proBNP, low <b>systolic</b> blood <b>pressure</b> gave a two-fold increased risk (hazard ratio 2. 0, 95 % confidence interval 1. 1 - 3. 4) compared with participants with high <b>systolic</b> blood <b>pressure.</b> For participants with high NT-proBNP, low <b>systolic</b> blood <b>pressure</b> provided a 1. 7 increased mortality risk (95 % confidence interval 1. 2 - 2. 3) compared with high <b>systolic</b> blood <b>pressure.</b> CONCLUSION: Low <b>systolic</b> blood <b>pressure</b> is predictive for increased mortality risk in 90 -year-old subjects, irrespective of the NT-proBNP level.
