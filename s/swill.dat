5|$|Among the downsides {{to rapid}} {{industrialization}} was pollution. Brick firing produced {{particulate air pollution}} and paint-making created lead dust, while beer and liquor brewing produced grain <b>swill.</b> The worst pollution was coal dust and smoke, for which St. Louis was infamous by the 1890s. The greatest number of complaints to the St. Louis Board of Health were due to industries engaged in rendering, which produced noxious fumes. In spite of this, pollution control was hindered {{by a desire to}} promote growth. One of the few controls began in 1880, in which regulations would be enforced strictly in some areas while little in others, thereby encouraging factories to concentrate in industrial districts.|$|E

25|$|The {{six o'clock}} <b>swill</b> was an Australian and New Zealand slang {{term for the}} last-minute rush to buy drinks at a hotel bar before it closed.

A culture of heavy drinking developed during the time between finishing work at 5 pm and the mandatory closing time only an hour later.|$|E

5000|$|John William [...] "Jack" [...] <b>Swilling</b> {{was born}} on April 1, 1830, at Red House Plantation, Anderson, South Carolina, to George <b>Swilling</b> and Margaret Farrar <b>Swilling,</b> the eighth of their 10 children. George <b>Swilling</b> {{was the son of}} the {{plantation}} manager, while Margaret Farrar's father,Thomas Farrar, was the owner. (Incidentally, Thomas Farrar's mother was Judith Jefferson, the sister of Peter Jefferson and aunt to the third president, Thomas Jefferson.) Farrar's parents did not approve of the marriage, so the young couple eloped. It took three years for her parents to accept the match. In time, George <b>Swilling</b> became owner of the plantation. When Jack <b>Swilling</b> was 14, the family moved from South Carolina to Georgia. Three years later he and an older brother enlisted in a mounted battalion of Georgia volunteers for service during the Mexican-American War. After the war, the two young men returned to Georgia. Jack Swilling's whereabouts are unknown for a brief time afterwards, although he was reported in Georgia for the Christmas of 1849.|$|R
25|$|When she was 17 {{years old}} she met John William <b>Swilling</b> {{better known as}} Jack <b>Swilling,</b> who {{happened}} to be in Tucson. Prior to meeting Escalante, Mr. <b>Swilling,</b> a native of Anderson, South Carolina, was in Los Pinos where he belonged to a militia named the Arizona Guards. The militia's primary objective was to defend the early Anglo settlers against the attacks by the members of the Apache tribes. In 1861, the secession of Confederate Arizona from the Union was officially declared. At that time Mr. <b>Swilling</b> held the rank of First Lieutenant of the militia. The Arizona Guards were absorbed into the Confederate Army.|$|R

The Portland Mercury said the bar served [...] "cheap <b>swill</b> to blue-collar folks and Reed kids that didn't mind walking those extra few blocks." [...] Barisich recalled that [...] "at one time, it was a favorite of concrete workers, city crews and the like. You couldn't keep the floor clean on a Friday afternoon. Every muddy workboot in the city was here." [...] It served beer only, accepted cash only, and offered the [...] "bare minimum of food that the OLCC required".|$|E

50|$|Jack <b>Swilling</b> had the {{inspiration}} {{to form a}} canal company which would open the Salt River Valley to farming. On November 16, 1867, he formed the <b>Swilling</b> Irrigating and Canal Company at Wickenburg. Soon after, {{a small group of}} men headed by Jack <b>Swilling</b> started construction of the first modern-era irrigation canals in the Salt River Valley; other pioneers and travelers had seen and commented on ancient Hohokam canals in the area, but it was <b>Swilling</b> who organized the first successful modern irrigation project. The following summer, the first crops of wheat, barley and corn were harvested. He promoted the irrigation system, which was in part inspired by the ruins of the Hohokam canals. <b>Swilling</b> Irrigating and Canal Company started the small farming community of Phoenix that has since grown into one of the United States' largest metropolitan areas. <b>Swilling</b> claimed a quarter section south of what became Van Buren Street between 32nd and 36th Streets for his own farm. He built a nine-room, 4700 sq ft home there. His farm was a local showplace, featuring an artificial pond with tame ducks, a vineyard and an orchard with a variety of fruit trees.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Swilling</b> {{was traded}} to the Detroit Lions in 1993 for draft picks. In order to sign <b>Swilling,</b> Detroit had to [...] "unretire" [...] the legendary Joe Schmidt’s number 56. In his first year with Detroit he made it to his fifth and final Pro Bowl. The Detroit Lions {{qualified}} for the playoffs in both of Swillings' seasons with the team, being eliminated each time, in the first round, by the Green Bay Packers. <b>Swilling</b> finished his career with 107.5 sacks.|$|R
2500|$|It is {{commonly}} believed that Lord Duppa proposed {{the name of}} Phoenix relating back {{to the story of}} the mythical Phoenix's rebirth from the ashes. The basis being the rebirth of a city of canals, rebuilt {{on the site of the}} ancient Hohokam prehistoric canal systems that dated back to about 700-1400 AD. Mr. <b>Swilling</b> was elected Justice of the Peace for the Phoenix Precinct and was Phoenix’s first postmaster. This earned Mr. <b>Swilling</b> the title [...] "the father of Phoenix" [...] and Mrs. <b>Swilling</b> the title [...] "the mother of Phoenix." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the first}} episode, Captain Cook, {{he claims to}} be the first Baldrick in the entire family tree to have a {{brilliant}} plan (becoming cooks for HQ to escape the trenches), giving a speech saying, [...] "Permission to write home immediately sir! This is the first brilliant plan a Baldrick's ever had. For centuries we've tried, and they've always turned out total pig <b>swill!</b> My mum will be pleased as punch." [...] This mood was however, slightly dampened when Blackadder pointed out the minor flaw: Baldrick is [...] "the worst cook in the entire world". He also hates hospitals because his grandfather went into one and when he came out, he was dead. Blackadder then points out that he was also dead when he went in, because he'd been run over by a traction engine.|$|E

2500|$|Among the downsides {{to rapid}} {{industrialization}} was pollution, of which St. Louis generated a great deal. Brick firing produced {{particulate air pollution}} and paint making created lead dust, while beer and liquor brewing produced grain <b>swill.</b> However, the worst pollution was coal dust and smoke, for which St. Louis was infamous by the 1890s. Nearly every factory relied on coal to fire steam boilers, the region's homes used a relatively more polluting form of bituminous coal, and railroad traffic created large, dense clouds of coal smoke around depots and railyards. [...] Noise pollution also was a problem, as many residential areas were intermixed with industrial areas. In spite of efforts to fill sinkholes before the Civil War, quarries dug holes in lots to produce brick, stone and soil for the building trades. These holes often filled with industrial waste, sewage, garbage, and dirty runoff.|$|E

2500|$|Brack's early {{conventional}} style {{evolved into}} one of simplified, almost stark, shapes and areas of deliberately drab colour, often featuring large areas of brown. He made an initial mark in the 1950s with works on the contemporary Australian culture, such as the iconic Collins St., 5 pm (1955), a view of rush hour in post-war Melbourne. [...] Set in a bleak palette of browns and greys, it was a comment on the conformity of everyday life, with all figures looking almost identical. [...] A related painting The Bar (1954) was modelled on Manet's A Bar at the Folies-Bergère, and satirised the six o'clock <b>swill,</b> a social ritual arising from the early closing of Australian pubs. [...] Most of these early paintings and drawings were unmistakably satirical comments against the Australian Dream, either being set in the newly expanding post-war suburbia or taking the life of those who lived there as their subject matter.|$|E
