"I am {{not sure}} if she ever became a Catholic herself {{but it was not}} long before <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{instruct}} two of her children, one of them being the future erratic genius, Oscar Wilde.

500|$|In a 2008 {{speech in}} Washington, Gillard {{endorsed}} the ANZUS Alliance {{and described the}} United States as a civilising global influence. Her former colleague and leader Mark Latham wrote in a 2009 article for the Australian Financial Review that these comments were [...] "hypocritical", given past private communications Gillard had exchanged with him which apparently mocked elements of American foreign policy: [...] "One of them concerned her study tour of the US, sponsored by the American Government in 2006—or to use her moniker—'a CIA re-education course'. <b>She</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> 'stand by for emails explaining George Bush is a great statesman, torture is justified in many circumstances and those Iraqi insurgents should just get over it'." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2004, she was {{featured}} partially nude in leading Indian photographer Dabboo Ratnani's annual calendar, {{which is a}} major happening in the Indian glamour industry. According to Daboo, [...] "Her mother saw it much later, after the calendar released. She thought it was too sexy, and Riya shouldn't have done it. But {{the response to the}} photograph was superb. Riya was so thrilled that for her next ad campaign, <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> light her up like I did in this." [...] A career highlight for the model, it led to a three-year contract with Ratnani to feature her on his annual calendar. She is the only female face to be featured on the calendar for five consecutive years (2003–07).|$|E

500|$|Sapochnik {{was asked}} in an {{interview}} what the most difficult shot was to direct, responding [...] "The final sequence of seeing the armada {{on its way to}} Westeros was complicated because it involved so many different ships, and we only had one that we had to redress and shoot again and again. It was also raining and freezing when we shot it, and {{it was meant to be}} a Mediterranean climate. Emilia Clarke got so cold, her jaw started shaking uncontrollably and she totally lost her thread as far as what she was meant to be thinking in that moment, the cold will do that. <b>She</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> help, so I suggested that she just hum the theme to Game of Thrones in her head while we were rolling the cameras, and apparently that worked because it's the take we used in the final cut!" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Beautiful" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Linda Perry. Aguilera recorded the song at two studios: The Enterprise Studios in Burbank, California, and Conway Recording Studios in Hollywood. Prior to the collaboration with Aguilera, Perry {{had written the}} song and originally wished to keep the [...] "personal" [...] record for her own singing career. Perry initially previewed the song for Pink during the recording sessions of Pink's second studio album Missundaztood (2001), on which Perry is a producer. However, after hearing Aguilera sing the song at Perry's house to [...] "break the ice", Perry was very impressed and allowed Aguilera to include the track on her then upcoming record Stripped, effectively deciding not to pursue a solo career. The choice resulted in a feud between Pink against Aguilera and Perry, with the former commenting that it was [...] "annoying" [...] for the latter to collaborate with artists [...] " [...] didn't like". Perry later revealed to ASCAP, [...] "When Christina came {{over to my house}} to start working, <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> play some songs to break the ice. [...] I had a long conversation with my manager about it. We both decided to hear Christina sing it. We demoed the song with her singing it, and I was like, 'Wow'. That rough vocal is what is out there on radio. It was that vocal that got her the song". Perry's wife Sara Gilbert confirmed on her show The Talk that the final version was [...] "just a demo." [...] Gilbert also revealed that Aguilera wanted to rerecord the song because she didn't like the initial vocals. Perry denied the request because the song is supposed to be about imperfection and being vulnerable.|$|E

Of playing with Emilyn, Viglione has been {{quoted as saying}} [...] "Emilyn and I have been friends {{for a long time and}} when <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> produce and play on her album of ukulele songs I was thrilled and, surprisingly, wound up playing marimba on it as well."
