40|$|The FFT {{processor}} {{serves as}} one of core components in numerous DSP-based systems, such as OFDM in modern wireless communication. While creating an FFT processor, key parameters, such as architecture, wordlength, and number format, must be all considered very carefully. In this paper, we propose an optimization flow that properly scales fixed-point numeric values at each butterfly stage to maximize the output SQNR under a fixed wordlength constraint. The proposed flow utilizes probability distribution to model the probabilistic behavior of the output signal at each stage. The computation errors due to quantization and <b>saturation</b> <b>operations</b> are statically analyzed before making scaling decisions. Therefore, without a need of time-consuming simulation, our method can efficiently determine the most appropriate number format for each stage and thus optimize the overall output SQNR. Besides, the proposed flow is capable of handling various FFT sizes, FFT algorithms, wordlengths, and input signal distributions. Experimental {{results indicate that the}} wordlength can be reduced about three bits for an 8 K-point radix- 2 memory-based FFT processor without compromise in the output SQNR.

40|$|Barrier paper, {{which is}} made of {{bleached}} absorbent kraft pulp, is a significant layer of decorative laminates, since it controls the see-through of brown color of saturating kraft paper and its opacifying effect usually is achieved by a heavy loading of TiO 2. The TiO 2, due to its very small particle size, passes between the cellulosic fibers and drains into the white water. To overcome this problem, papermakers try to use various retention aids for improving overall retention of TiO 2, but agglomeration of TiO 2 causes a decrease in light scattering efficiency of TiO 2. During the subsequent <b>saturation</b> <b>operation,</b> {{the air in the}} voids is replaced by melamine formaldehyde, which has a refractive index close to that of cellulose.

The dispersed aqueous slurry of anhydrous magnesium silicate forms fine gel that entraps TiO 2 in the wet web and prevents removal of fines and fillers.

40|$|The {{concentrations}} of mercury at the FAVC inlet and exit were measured during the BL 1 and PX 6 runs of the Integrated DWPF Melter System (IDMS) with the HEME bypassed {{and without the}} ammonia scrubber.

The concentration of mercury at the FAVC inlet {{was found to be}} 0. 66 - 6. 2 times the saturation value (based on the SRAT condenser exit). In the PX 7 run, the ammonia scrubber was used and the FAVC HEME was not bypassed.

40|$|Global warming {{arguments}} {{have gained}} {{more and more}} attention due to the new regulations of carbon dioxide (CO 2) emission in the world. Monoethanolamine (MEA) has been employed as an important industrial absorbent for CO 2 capture since the 1930 s because of its high reaction rate, relatively low cost, and thermal stability. The concentration of MEA in aqueous solution is generally increased to 30 mass % in the CO 2 capture process. The energy consumption is high in the present MEA process {{because of the high}} reaction heat of MEA with CO 2, and a large number of liquid transportation. To reduce the energy consumption and improve the efficiency of CO 2 capture in the present MEA process, further increase in solution concentration of MEA is a potential solution. Basic research on the properties and reaction kinetics with CO 2 of concentrated aqueous MEA solution is necessary to perform engineering calculations and important for the dimensioning of pipes, pumps and heat exchangers etc. In this work, a novel solubility apparatus and technique was designed and built for the measurement of physical solubility of a gas in liquid. The technique employs a scaled spiral glass tube with a small drop of mercury inside as a eudiometer as an alternative to a three–branch U–tube setup to keep the system pressure constant, and measure the volume drop of absorbed gas at constant temperature. A “vacuum gas saturation” method is proposed for gas <b>saturation</b> <b>operation</b> in the measurement. The physical solubilities of N 2 O in pure water over the temperature range from 298. 15 to 323. 15 K and in aqueous salt MEA solutions at 313. 15 K were measured under a constant ambient pressure to validate the new technique. The new solubility apparatus and technique possesses some advantages including easy operation, lower mercury inventory, higher sensitivity and greater accurate. The physical mass transfer coefficients of N 2 O in aqueous MEA solutions were performed using the new apparatus as well. The physical solubilities of N 2 O in aqueous MEA solutions over the full concentrations range were measured by the novel solubility apparatus over a temperature range from 298. 15 to 323. 15 K under a constant ambient pressure. The physical solubilities of CO 2 in aqueous MEA solutions were estimated using “N 2 O analogy” method. The results of the solubility measurements of N 2 O and CO 2 in water and N 2 O in aqueous MEA solutions agree with literature. A semiempirical model to solubility proposed by Wang et al. was used to correlate the solubilities of N 2 O and CO 2 in aqueous MEA solutions, and the correlation results are in agreement with experiment data. The results show that the solubilities of both N 2 O and CO 2 in aqueous MEA solutions showed negative deviation behaviors from the linear additive principle. The viscosities of aqueous MEA solutions over the full concentration range were measured using a rheometer with a double–gap measuring system at a temperature range from 298. 15 to 353. 15 K. The measured viscosity data are in good agreement with the literature values. An exponent model proposed by DiGuilio et al. was used to correlate the data and the results are very satisfied for the regression of the viscosities of pure MEA from 298. 15 to 353. 15 K. The polynomial model proposed by Teng et al. with five parameters is satisfied the aqueous MEA solution. The relationship between the viscosity and mole fraction of MEA shows both positive and negative deviation behavior and the critical mole fraction of MEA was found is 0. 2. The molecular diffusivities of N 2 O in aqueous MEA solutions up to 12 M were studied from 298. 15 to 333. 15 K using a laminar liquid jet absorber, and the diffusivities of CO 2 in aqueous MEA solutions were calculated by the N 2 O analogy method. A modified construction of the temperature control for the laminar liquid jet was proposed. The relationship between the diffusivity and the viscosity of the solution is roughly in agreement with the modified Stokes–Einstein equations. On the other hand, an exponent mathematical model was used to correlate N 2 O diffusivities in aqueous MEA solutions satisfactorily for calculation of the diffusivities of CO 2 in aqueous MEA solutions. Based on the measured physical properties in this work, the chemical reaction kinetics of CO 2 with aqueous MEA solutions over a wide concentration range from 0. 5 to 12 M were investigated using a stirred cell absorber with a plane gas–liquid interface over a temperature range from 298. 15 to 323. 15 K. To satisfy the criterion of pseudo-first-order reaction, low CO 2 partial pressure (3 – 4 kPa) was employed. The rates of CO 2 absorption in the solutions were determined from the fall in pressure, and the reaction rate constants were determinate by two treatment methods on the same experimental data, viz. a “differential” and an “integral” method, which are derived from the mass balance principle and Henry’s law. The reaction between MEA and CO 2 is based on “zwitterion” mechanism in this work. The gas-phase resistance was investigated systematically in the stirred cell. To reduce the gas phase resistances in the measurements of CO 2 absorption in the solutions, speeding up the gas phase fans and employing very low inert gas pressures of N 2 and solution vapor were suggested. The chemical reaction kinetics of CO 2 in aqueous MEA solutions were measured over the concentration range from 0. 5 to 12 M by a stirred cell absorber with batchwise operation for both gas and liquid. As same as the dilute solution, the reaction of concentrated aqueous IV MEA solution with CO 2 is also first order with respect to MEA and the reaction is in the fast reaction regime. The reaction activation energy (Ea) of aqueous MEA + CO 2 is calculated based on the experimental data. The enhanced mass transfer coefficient in liquid phase, kLE, increases with the concentration of MEA solutions but decreases when the molarity of MEA is higher than 8 M. Last, some recommendations are given to the future work. CO 2 –loaded MEA solution is suggested to focus on in the next–step work, the properties and gas absorption of the system can be measured and discussion by the same experimental method mentioned in this thesis. The gas absorption and desorption from the CO 2 –loaded aqueous MEA solutions should be performed as well. The issue of heat transfer should be taken into account and investigated when the concentrated aqueous MEA solution is employed in the CO 2 capture process. The stirred cell or laminar liquid jet can be employed in these studies under a suitable pressure. However, to obtain more accurate experimental data, some modifications on the construction of both the laminar liquid jet and stirred cell should be made. For example, the absorption cell of the liquid laminar jet can be smaller, and the nozzle or receiver should be adjustable etc. Regarding the modification on the temperature control of these equipments, the main idea is to immerse all the gas and liquid pipes in to the same water bath or its hose. Some suggestions of these modifications are proposed in the appendix of this thesis...|$|E
