Rick Anderson of AllMusic noted that on [...] "Scissors", Taylor [...] "actually sounds like he's about to burst into tears. Taylor's aggressive, expletive-filled lyrics were noted by AllMusic; [...] " [...] lyrics that are discernible are not generally quotable on a family website; <b>suffice</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the members of Slipknot are not impressed with their fathers, their hometown or most anything else." [...] "Eeyore", a hidden track placed {{at the end of}} [...] "Scissors", begins after dialogue shared among the band members that was recorded while they were viewing a scene in a pornographic film that involved coprophilia, is heard. It has been played live many times and appears on both the DVD Disasterpieces and the live album [...]|$|E

500|$|Garofalo, pg. 94 <b>Suffice</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> lest we {{get lost}} in history, that the music {{that came to be}} called rock 'n' roll began in the 1950s as diverse and seldom heard {{segments}} of the population achieved a dominant voice in mainstream culture and transformed the very concept of what popular music was.|$|R
50|$|Note: Any {{reference}} {{in the pages}} of the All-Star Squadron to Earth-Two heroes such as Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman cannot be canon in the post-Crisis universe, and the engagement of the time-traveling Earth-Two Infinity Inc. in these events is now highly confused as well. <b>Suffice</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> the Ultra-Humanite had minions and the minions lost.|$|R

[...] "What I was told by his family", said Stevenson, [...] "was that he died from a diabetic coma and he never came to, he just died in his sleep. But <b>suffice</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Frank was in very poor health. Maybe the last ten years of his life, I saw a real decline there [...] Of course, we rekindled our friendship years later in a way that was very ultimate and very real, and it didn’t involve the band because he wasn’t in the band. He would come out here every year and stay for about a month with me, every year. He did it for years, until he died." ...|$|E

Once laws have been passed, it is critical that disability-inclusive policies are supported by the executives who would need to implement such policies. It is equally important that such policies have adequate budgetary support to be fully implemented. In the case of the Philippines, there is adequate legislative support for disability-inclusive electoral policies but limited executive backing as manifested by its budgetary support.|$|R
5000|$|Petitioner {{attempts}} to argue an absurd proposition, essentially that the State of Illinois {{is not part}} of the United States. His hope is that he will find some semantic technicality which will render him exempt from Federal income tax, which applies generally to all U.S. citizens and residents. <b>Suffice</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> we find no support in any of the authorities petitioner cites for his position that he is not subject to Federal income tax on income he earned in Illinois.|$|R

5000|$|These wartime initiatives, {{inclusive}} of the Declaration, are frequently considered together by historians {{because of the}} potential, real or imagined, for incompatibility between them, particularly {{in regard to the}} disposition of Palestine.

50|$|A present subjunctive verb form is {{sometimes}} {{found in a}} main clause, {{with the force of}} a wish or a third person imperative (and such forms can alternatively be analyzed as imperatives).

500|$|Several {{media outlets}} {{described}} [...] "An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig" [...] {{as one of}} the most popular early South Park episodes. Tom Carson of Newsday said it was the most outrageous South Park episode until [...] "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" [...] aired three months later. Many reviewers said the mere title demonstrated the crudeness and originality of South Park, then still a relatively new show. Chris Vognar of The Dallas Morning News said, [...] "With episode titles such as, 'An Elephant Makes Love <b>to</b> a Pig,' <b>suffice</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> there ain't much on the air like it." ...|$|R

5000|$|In 2001, Calimetrics {{demonstrated}} hardware prototypes for a 2GB ML-CD reader/writer, using blank-media {{that was}} very similar to CD. By the time the ML-CD system was ready to enter consumer production (late 2001), CD-R/RW drives had dropped significantly in price due to the entry of Taiwanese producers and industry backing behind the various DVD recordable formats had become significant. In addition, the illfated Sony double-density CD format (DDCD) had already come and gone without any lasting impact on the market. This left ML-CD, another offshoot of the CD, with an uncertain outlook. <b>Suffice</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> without a launch commitment from drive and blank-media industry, ML-CD drives never reached the consumer-market.|$|R
