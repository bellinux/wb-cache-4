The improved dispersion of MWCNTs in non-polar solvents provides a way to fabricate PDMS nanocomposite films by solvent evaporation from a mixed solution of polymer and nanofiller.|$|R

40|$|The {{supercritical}} antisolvent process (SAS) {{has been}} frequently {{used to obtain}} microparticles and nanoparticles. The fluid dynamics of the process related {{to the study of}} the liquid jet in contact with supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2) is characterized by a one-phase mixing at supercritical conditions and a two-phase mixing at subcritical conditions. The transition between the two kinds of mixing can be measured in terms of amplitude of the corresponding pressure range; some organic <b>solvents,</b> <b>like</b> dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) are characterized by a wide pressure range, other <b>solvents,</b> <b>like</b> acetone (AC), by a narrow pressure range. Generally, microparticles are precipitated by atomization, droplets formation and drying in the transition range, whereas nanoparticles are precipitated in correspondence of completely developed supercritical conditions. Mixing a wide-transition <b>solvent,</b> <b>like</b> DMSO, to a narrow-transition <b>solvent,</b> <b>like</b> acetone, the pressure range of the transition from one-phase mixing to two-phase mixing and, accordingly, the morphology of the precipitates will change. In this work, two model compounds were SAS processed from DMSO/AC mixtures: cellulose acetate, which is slightly soluble in DMSO and freely soluble in acetone with the aim of obtaining microparticles and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) that is slightly soluble in acetone and freely soluble in DMSO in order to obtain nanoparticles. In the case of cellulose acetate, well-defined microparticles with a mean diameter of 0. 42 μm were obtained, whereas, for PVP, nanoparticles with a mean diameter of 114 nm were precipitated, demonstrating that this SAS strategy is successful...|$|R

The drug release was extended maximum up to 12 hours with cellulose acetate using 1 - 4 dioxan as solvent and up to 12 hours with cellulose acetate phthalate using 1, 4 -dioxan and dimethyldigol. FTIR and DSC results showed ondansetron hydrochloride was compatible with excipients. The curve fitting data revealed that the release followed first order kinetics and higuchi’s and peppas plots stated non-fickian and diffusion controlled.
