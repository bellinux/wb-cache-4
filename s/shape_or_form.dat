40|$|We {{briefly and}} informally review the {{concepts}} of size, shape, and form {{and how they are}} estimated in geometric morphometrics using Procrustes analysis. We demonstrate how deformation grids and reconstructed <b>shapes</b> <b>or</b> <b>forms</b> can be used as powerful tools to visualize shape and form differences. Complex patterns of individual or group differences can be studied effectively by ordinations of <b>shape</b> space <b>or</b> <b>form</b> space. Allometry, the statistical relationship between size and shape, is estimated in geometric morphometrics by regression of the Procrustes shape coordinates on centroid size. We illustrate these methods by an application to human face shape. We reveal shape cues to body size in the adult male face, partly resembling ontogenetic allometry. Facial allometry might thus be an important confounding factor in studies of face perception and human mate choice.

50|$|One {{application}} is for metal <b>shaping</b> <b>or</b> <b>forming.</b> By selectively laser shocking {{areas on the}} surface of metal sheets or plates, or smaller items such as airfoils, the associated compressive residual stresses cause the material to flex in a controllable manner. In this way a particular shape can be imparted to a component, or a distorted component might be brought back into the desired shape. Thus, this process is capable of bringing manufactured parts back into design tolerance limits and form shaping thin section parts.|$|R

50|$|Increased {{strength}} {{often comes}} {{at a cost of}} increased density, which in turn demands higher flow rates, viscosities or pressures during fracturing, which translates to increased fracturing costs, both environmentally and economically. Lightweight proppants conversely are designed to be lighter than sand (~2.5 g/cm3) and thus allow pumping at lower pressures or fluid velocities. Light proppants are less likely to settle. Porous materials can break the strength-density trend, or even afford greater gas permeability. Proppant geometry is also important; certain <b>shapes</b> <b>or</b> <b>forms</b> amplify stress on proppant particles making them especially vulnerable to crushing (a sharp discontinuity can classically allow infinite stresses in linear elastic materials).|$|R

The lognormal probability distribution of grain size in polycrystalline nanomaterials is used, a fact observed both theoretically and experimentally [23 – 26].|$|R
