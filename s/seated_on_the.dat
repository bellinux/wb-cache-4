5|$|Krøyer {{had visited}} the atelier where Marie was {{studying}} on several occasions, but {{the first of his}} works in which she appears is A Duet, painted in Heinrich Hirschsprung's Copenhagen home in 1887 where she had been invited to model for him. She can be seen <b>seated</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left of the painting in a red dress.|$|E
5|$|The benediction being concluded, the {{sovereign}} {{rises from the}} Coronation Chair and is borne into a throne. Once the monarch is <b>seated</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> throne, the formula Stand firm, and hold fast from henceforth…– a translation of the Latin formula Sta et retine…, historically used for the enthronement of other Christian sovereigns – is recited.|$|E
5|$|Ragnall mac Somairle (also {{known in}} Gaelic as Raghnall, Raonall, Raonull; in English as Ranald, Reginald; in Latin as Reginaldus; and in Old Norse as Rögnvaldr, Røgnvaldr, Rǫgnvaldr; died 1191/1192/1227) was a {{significant}} late twelfth century magnate, <b>seated</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> western seaboard of Scotland. He was probably a younger son of Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, Lord of Argyll and his wife, Ragnhildr, daughter of Óláfr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles. The twelfth-century Kingdom of the Isles, ruled by Ragnall's father and maternal-grandfather, existed within a hybrid Norse-Gaelic milieu, which bordered an ever strengthening and consolidating Kingdom of Scots.|$|E

5|$|Symphony in White, No. 3 shows Heffernan {{reclining}} on a {{sofa with}} her head rested on her hand, while Jones is <b>seated</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, leaning against the sofa. There is a fan on the floor, and a plant bearing white flowers on the right. The fan is an oriental element, and {{an expression of the}} artistic trend known as Japonisme which was then prevalent in European art. At the time, Whistler was greatly influenced by his friend and colleague Albert Joseph Moore. The painting bears close resemblances to Moore's roughly contemporary painting , though at the time the two were working so closely together {{that it is hard to}} ascertain exactly who influenced whom.|$|E
5|$|The four-headed god Brahma {{should be}} shown <b>seated</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{ground in the}} {{foreground}} officiating as the wedding priest and making offerings to the homa (sacred fire) in the kunda (fire-altar). The four-armed god holds a sruka and sruva (sacrificial ladle and spoon) in his front arms and a kamandalu (water-pot) and akshamala (rosary) in his back arms. The presence of the fire also indicates another important ritual of the Hindu wedding, saptapadi ("seven steps") where {{the bride and groom}} go around the fire seven times.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the reign}} of Henry VIII, the {{sovereign}} always granted his or her assent in person. The sovereign, wearing the Imperial State Crown, would be <b>seated</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> throne in the Lords chamber, surrounded by heralds {{and members of the}} royal court—a scene that nowadays is repeated only at the annual State Opening of Parliament. The Commons, led by their speaker, would listen from the Bar of the Lords, just outside the chamber. The Clerk of the Parliaments presented the bills awaiting assent to the monarch, save that supply bills were traditionally brought up by the speaker. The Clerk of the Crown, standing on the sovereign's right, then read aloud the titles of the bills (in earlier times, the entire text of the bills). The Clerk of the Parliaments, standing on the sovereign's left, responded by stating the appropriate Norman French formula.|$|E

5|$|Like most flight {{instructors}} giving dual instruction, Reid was <b>seated</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right side, {{while the}} aircraft's primary flight instruments were {{mounted on the}} left, in front of Dubroff in this case. Investigators speculated {{that because of the}} heavy rain in his immediate climb path, Reid's forward visibility became greatly restricted. To maintain control through the climbing right turn, {{he would have had to}} turn his head to the left to see the flight instruments (most critically the attitude and airspeed indicators) and to the right to see the ground through the side window. Such side-to-side head motion, combined with the worsening flight visibility during the climb and the reduced stall margin, could have led to spatial disorientation and loss of control.|$|E
5|$|Ragnall is {{the only}} member of the meic Somairle known to have styled himself in {{documents}} rex insularum. His use of both the title and seal are probably derived from those of the leading members of the Crovan dynasty, such as his namesake Rǫgnvaldr, who not only bore the same title but was said to have borne a similar two-sided seal. The descriptions of the cousins' seals shows that these devices combined the imagery of a Norse-Gaelic galley and an Anglo-French knight. The maritime imagery probably symbolised the power of a ruler of an island-kingdom, and the equestrian imagery appears to have symbolised feudal society, in which the cult of knighthood had reached its peak in the twelfth- and early thirteenth centuries. The use of such seals by leading Norse-Gaelic lords, <b>seated</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> periphery of the kingdoms of Scotland and England, probably illustrates their desire to present themselves as up-to-date and modern to their contemporaries in Anglo-French society.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also an}} {{indeterminate}} {{relationship between}} the figures in the spandrels and the lunettes beneath them. Because of {{the constraints of the}} triangular shape, in each spandrel the figures are <b>seated</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground. In six of the eight spandrels the compositions resemble traditional depictions of the Flight into Egypt. Of the two remaining, one shows a woman with shears trimming the neck of a garment she is making while her toddler looks on. The Biblical woman who is recorded as making a new garment for her child is Hannah, the mother of Samuel, whose child went to live in the temple, and indeed, the male figure in the background is wearing a distinctive hat that might suggest that of a priest. The other figure who differs from the rest is a young woman who sits staring out of the picture with prophetic intensity. Her open eyes have been closed in the restoration.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concert hall}} {{features}} seating {{from throughout the}} orchestra, loge, mezzanine and balcony sections. There are side box seats at the mezzanine and balcony levels, seat towers can be positioned on stage, and additional seats can be placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lift (see [...] "The Stage"). At maximum, there are 1,171 <b>seats</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main floor (Orchestra & Loge), 290 <b>seats</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mezzanine level, and 528 <b>seats</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> balcony level.|$|R

5|$|Rice is {{the staple}} diet, while fish is an {{integral}} component of coastal South Indian meals. Coconut and spices are used extensively in South Indian cuisine. The region has a rich cuisine involving both traditional non-vegetarian and vegetarian dishes comprising rice, legumes and lentils. Its distinct aroma and flavour is achieved by the blending of flavourings and spices including curry leaves, mustard seeds, coriander, ginger, garlic, chili, pepper, cinnamon, cloves, green cardamom, cumin, nutmeg, coconut and rosewater. The traditional way of eating a meal involves being <b>seated</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor, having the food served on a banana leaf and using clean fingers of the right hand to take the food into the mouth. After the meal, the fingers are washed; the easily degradable banana leaf is discarded or becomes fodder for cattle. Eating on banana leaves is a custom thousands of years old, imparts a unique flavor to the food and is considered healthy. Idli, dosa, uthappam, appam, pongal and paniyaram are popular dishes for breakfast. Rice is served with sambar, rasam and poriyal for lunch. Andhra cuisine is characterised by pickles and spicy curries. Chettinad cuisine is famous for non-vegetarian items and Hyderabadi cuisine is popular for its biryani.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the He 111 A-L {{initially}} had a conventional stepped cockpit, {{with a pair of}} windscreen-like panels for the pilot and co-pilot. The He 111P and subsequent production variants were fitted with fully glazed cockpits and a laterally asymmetric nose, with the port side having the greater curvature for the pilot, offsetting the bombardier to starboard. The resulting stepless cockpit, which was a feature on a number of German bomber designs during the war years in varying shapes and formats, no longer had the separate windscreen panels for the pilot. Pilots had to look outside through the same bullet-like glazing that was used by the bombardier and navigator. The pilot was <b>seated</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left and the navigator/bomb aimer on the right. The navigator went forward to the prone bomb-aiming position or could tilt his chair to one side, to move into the rear of the aircraft. There was no cockpit floor below the pilot's feet—the rudder pedals being on arms—giving very good visibility below. Sliding and removable panels were manufactured into the nose glazing to allow the pilot, navigator and or bomb aimer to exit the aircraft quickly, without a time-consuming retreat into the fuselage.|$|E
5|$|The earth may be personified as {{the goddess}} Bhudevi in Indian sculpture. Bhudevi is often shown {{as a small}} figure in the icon. She may be seated on or {{dangling}} from one of Varaha's tusks, or is <b>seated</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> corner of his folded elbow or his shoulder and supports herself against the tusk or the snout, as being lifted from the waters. In later Indian paintings, the whole earth or {{a part of it}} is depicted lifted up by Varaha's tusks. In Mahabalipuram, a rare portrayal shows an affectionate Varaha looking down to Bhudevi, who he carries in his arms. The earth may be portrayed as a globe, a flat stretch of mountainous land or an elaborate forest landscape with buildings, temples, humans, birds and animals. The defeated demon may be depicted trampled under Varaha's feet or being killed in combat by Varaha's gada. Nagas (snake gods) and their consorts Naginis (snake goddesses), residents of the underworld, may be depicted as swimming in the ocean with hands folded as a mark of devotion. Varaha may be also depicted standing on a snake or other minor creatures, denoting the cosmic waters.|$|E

50|$|Labour {{increased}} its majority <b>on</b> <b>the</b> council after gaining 7 seats, including 6 from the Liberal Democrats. This took Labour to 35 councillors, while reducing the Liberal Democrats to 9 <b>seats</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> council, {{with the only}} Liberal Democrat to be elected being Michael Haw in Eccleston. Meanwhile, {{the wife of the}} Conservative group leader, Nancy Ashcroft, lost her <b>seat</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> council in Windle to Labour, reducing the Conservatives to 4 <b>seats</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> council.|$|R
5|$|Scottish coronations were {{traditionally}} held at Scone Abbey, {{with the}} king <b>seated</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Stone of Destiny. The original rituals were a fusion of ceremonies used by the kings of Dál Riata, based on the inauguration of Aidan by Columba in 574, and by the Picts from whom the Stone of Destiny came. A crown {{does not seem to}} have been used until the inauguration of AlexanderII in 1214. The ceremony included the laying on of hands by a senior cleric and the recitation of the king's genealogy. AlexanderIII was the last Scottish king to be crowned in this way in 1249, since the Stone was captured by the English forces of Edward I in 1296. It was later incorporated into the English Coronation Chair and its first certain use at an English coronation was that of HenryIV in 1399. Pope JohnXXII in a bull of 1329 granted the kings of Scotland the right to be anointed and crowned. No record exists of the exact form of the medieval rituals, but a later account exists of the coronation of the 17-month-old infant JamesV at Stirling Castle in 1513. The ceremony was held in a church, since demolished, within the castle walls and was conducted by the Bishop of Glasgow, because the Archbishop of StAndrews had been killed at the Battle of Flodden. It is likely that the child would have been knighted before the start of the ceremony. The coronation itself started with a sermon, followed by the anointing and crowning, then the coronation oath, in this case taken for the child by an unknown noble or priest, and finally an oath of fealty and acclamation by the congregation.|$|E
