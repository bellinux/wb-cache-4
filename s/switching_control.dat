40|$|This work proposes three <b>switched</b> <b>control</b> {{strategies}} for aggregated heating, ventilation, {{and air conditioning}} (HVAC) systems in commercial buildings to track the automatic generation control (AGC) signal in smart grid. The existing control strategies include the direct load control strategy and the setpoint regulation strategy. The direct load control strategy cannot track the AGC signal when the state of charge (SOC) of the aggregated thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) exceeds their regulation capacity, while the setpoint regulation strategy provides flexible regulation capacity, but causes larger tracking errors. To improve the tracking performance, we took {{the advantages of the}} two control modes and developed three <b>switched</b> <b>control</b> strategies. The <b>control</b> strategies <b>switch</b> between the direct load control mode and the setpoint regulation mode according to different switching indices. Specifically, we design a discrete-time controller and optimize the controller parameter for the setpoint regulation strategy using the Fibonacci optimization algorithm, enabling us to propose two <b>switched</b> <b>control</b> strategies across multiple time steps. Furthermore, we extend the <b>switched</b> <b>control</b> strategies by introducing a two-stage regulation in a single time step. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed <b>switched</b> <b>control</b> strategies can reduce the tracking errors for frequency regulation...|$|R

They generated a so-called histogram (actually a scatterplot) of parts of the fabric where failures were particularly numerous, usually pointing to a particular bad crosspoint, even if it failed sporadically rather than consistently. Local workers could then busy out the appropriate switch or grid and replace it.|$|E

Specifically, he developed an optimality-based nonlinear control framework to synthesize robust globally stabilizing disturbance rejection controllers for nonlinear systems with structured nonlinear parametric uncertainty and uncertain exogenous disturbances. His results have been applied to combustion systems to suppress the effects of thermoacoustic instabilities in gas turbine engines as well as propulsion systems to control the aerodynamic instabilities of rotating stall and surge in jet engines. This research has demonstrated concrete improvements in compression system performance, robustness, reliability, and maintainability in highly visible United States Department of Defense projects under the support of National Science Foundation, AFOSR, ARO, and NASA. His book Hierarchical Nonlinear <b>Switching</b> <b>Control</b> Design with Application to Propulsion Systems, London, UK: Springer-Verlag, 2000, in this area provides a novel and unique hierarchical nonlinear <b>switching</b> <b>control</b> framework for general nonlinear uncertain systems giving a rigorous alternative to gain scheduling control for systems with multiple modes of operation.|$|E
