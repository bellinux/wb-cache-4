2500|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, {{there is}} no classification for the châteaux of Pomerol.

Some producers, such as Nicolas de Bailliencourt of Château Gazin, believe most of the opposition is from small growers who fear being left off any ranking making their wines perceived to be inferior. Another proprietor told wine writer Stephen Brooks that the current, unranked system [...] "allows the mediocre wines to profit from the reputation of Pomerol's best wines." [...] and pointed to the results of the 2002 AOC label tasting panel, determining whether wines are allowed to bear the name AOC Pomerol on their wine label.

[...] Wadell recommented the book for readers, and observed, [...] "You can skip a lot of articles in a magazine and <b>still</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> you 'got through' the whole thing; a book isn't over till it's over.
