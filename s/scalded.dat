40|$|In two turkey {{processing}} {{plants in the}} northwest of Germany, skin samples were taken at 4 different positions (prior to <b>scalding,</b> after plucking, before and during chilling), which {{was repeated three times}} per sampling day (two days). The <b>scalding</b> technique was different (steam respectively water <b>scalding).</b> Samples were examined for total aerobic plate count as a hygiene parameter and the zoonotic agents Salmonella and Campylobacter. The examinations followed § 35 LMBG, DIN 10113 - 1 and DIN-ISO DIS 10272. After identification, Salmonella and a selection of Campylobacter isolates were characterized using molecularbiological pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). It was the aim of this study to reflect the influence of steam <b>scalding</b> on the microbiological status of the turkey skin compared to water <b>scalding</b> and the distribution of zoonotic agents under different <b>scalding</b> techniques. <b>Scalding</b> is generally recognised a a weak point in poultry processing. <b>Scalding</b> by steam {{is considered to be a}} potential alternative to water <b>scalding.</b> In abattoir one (water <b>scalding),</b> an average total aerobic plate count was obtained lg 4 and 5. No significant reduction of the total aerobic plate count during <b>scalding</b> and plucking was observed. In the end, the microbial count at the chilling position was lower than in the beginning. In abattoir two (steam <b>scalding),</b> the total aerobic plate count was between lg 3, 63 and lg 7, 13. The microbial count was lower after plucking than prior to <b>scalding.</b> A reduction of the total aerobic plate count was sometimes significant. However, during the following procedures the microbial count increased. So in the end, steam <b>scalding</b> had no impact on the microbial count underlining the importance of the complete processing line. In abattoir one (water <b>scalding),</b> 58 % of the samples were Salmonella positive. 6 Salmonella serovars (S. Typhimurium, S. Indiana, S. Agona, S. Heidelberg, S. of Group B and S. Saintpaul) were recovered. No Salmonella was identified at the first position of sampling. 42 % of the samples were Campylobacter positive (C. jejuni und C. coli). In abattoir two (steam <b>scalding),</b> 22 % of the samples were Salmonella positive which were recovered at each of the 4 sampling sites. Salmonella serovars were S. Typhimurium, S. Heidelberg und S. Saintpaul. Altogether 89 % of the samples were Campylobacter positive at each sampling site: C. jejuni, C. coli and C. lari were identified. The results of PFGE demonstrate, that both, Salmonella and Campylobacter strains are being transferred through the whole processing line demonstrating the lack of critical points with respect to both zoonotic agents. With respect to restrictive legislation on zoonotic agents in the near future, the poultry processing lines must become more safe with respect to bacterial transfer...|$|R

40|$|Background Most {{intentional}} burns are <b>scalds,</b> and distinguishing these from unintentional causes is challenging. Aim To {{conduct a}} systematic review to identify distinguishing features of intentional and unintentional <b>scalds.</b> Methods We performed an all language literature search of 12 databases 1950 – 2006. Studies were reviewed by two paediatric/burns specialists, using standardised methodology. Included: Primary studies of validated intentional or accidental <b>scalds</b> in children 0 – 18 years and ranked by confirmation of intentional or unintentional origin. Excluded: neglectful scalds; management or complications; studies of mixed burn type or mixed adult and child data. Results 258 studies were reviewed, and 26 included. Five comparative studies ranked highly for confirmation of intentional/unintentional cause of injury. The distinguishing characteristics were defined based on best evidence. Intentional <b>scalds</b> were commonly immersion injuries, caused by hot tap water, affecting the extremities, buttocks or perineum or both. The <b>scalds</b> were symmetrical with clear upper margins, and associated with old fractures and unrelated injuries. Unintentional <b>scalds</b> were more commonly due to spill injuries of other hot liquids, affecting {{the upper body}} with irregular margins and depth.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Scalds</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} common forms of thermal injury in young {{children}} worldwide. Childhood <b>scald</b> injuries, which mostly occur in the home, result in substantial health service use and considerable morbidity and mortality. There is little research on effective interventions to prevent <b>scald</b> injuries in young children. OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationship between a range of modifiable risk factors for medically attended <b>scalds</b> in children under the age of 5  years. DESIGN: A multicentre case-control study in UK hospitals and minor injury units with parallel home observation to validate parental reported exposures. Cases will be 0 - 4  years old with a medically attended <b>scald</b> injury which occurred in their home or garden, matched on gender and age with community controls. An additional control group will comprise unmatched hospital controls drawn from children aged 0 - 4 years attending the same hospitals and minor injury units for other types of injury. Conditional logistic regression will be used for the analysis of cases and matched controls, and unconditional logistic regression for the analysis of cases and unmatched controls to estimate ORs and 95 % CI, adjusted and unadjusted for confounding variables. MAIN EXPOSURE MEASURES: Use of safety equipment and safety practices for <b>scald</b> prevention and <b>scald</b> hazards. DISCUSSION: This large case-control study will investigate modifiable risk factors for <b>scalds</b> injuries, adjust for potential confounders and validate measures of exposure.

40|$|Background: ‘Honeycrisp’ is {{an apple}} {{cultivar}} that {{is susceptible to}} soft <b>scald,</b> a chilling injury expressed as necrotic patches on the peel. Improved understanding of metabolism associated with the disorder would improve our understanding of soft <b>scald</b> and contribute to developing more effective management strategies for apple storage. It was expected that specific gene expression and specific metabolite levels in the peel would be linked with soft <b>scald</b> risk at harvest and/or specific time points during cold storage. Results: Fruit from nine ‘Honeycrisp’ apple orchards that would eventually develop different incidences of soft <b>scald</b> between 4 and 8 weeks of cold air storage were used to contrast and determine differential transcriptomic and metabolomic changes during storage. Untargeted metabolic profiling revealed changes {{in a number of}} distinct pathways preceding and concurrent with soft <b>scald</b> symptom development, including elevated γ-aminobutryic acid (GABA), 1 -hexanol, acylated steryl glycosides, and free p-coumaryl acyl esters. At harvest, levels of sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid acyl esters were relatively higher in peel of fruit that did not later develop the disorder. RNA-seq driven gene expression profiling highlighted possible involvement of genes and associated metabolic processes with soft <b>scald</b> development. These included elevated expression of genes involved in lipid peroxidation and phenolic metabolism in fruit with soft <b>scald,</b> and isoprenoid/brassinosteroid metabolism in fruit that did not develop soft <b>scald.</b> Expression of other stress-related genes in fruit that developed soft <b>scald</b> included chlorophyll catabolism, cell wall loosening, and lipid transport while superoxide dismutases were up-regulated in fruit that did not develop the disorder. Conclusions: This study delineates the sequential transcriptomic and metabolomic changes preceding soft <b>scald</b> symptom development. Changes were differential depending on susceptibility of fruit to the disorder and could be attributed to key stress related and mediating pathways. Keywords:status: publishe...|$|R
