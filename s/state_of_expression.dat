Epigenetic patterns are sculpted during development to shape the diversity of gene expression programs in the different cell types of the organism.

It is postulated here that not only chemicals but also exposure of the young pup to social behavior, such as maternal care, could affect the epigenome. Since epigenetic programming defines the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>expression</b> of genes, epigenetic differences could have the same consequences as genetic polymorphisms.

Materials and Methods: In this descriptive analytic study, hematoxylin- and eosin-stained slides of OKCs and UAs available from the archives of the oral pathology laboratory of the Esfahan School of Dentistry were examined. Twenty-five noninflamed solitary odontogenic keratocysts and 25 unicystic ameloblastomas (of either type) were selected and stained immunohistochemically. Distribution and staining intensity score (SID score) for P 16 - and cyclin D 1 -positive cells was calculated in both groups.

40|$|Duplicated genes can {{contribute}} to the evolution of new functions and they are common in eukaryotic genomes. After duplication, genes can show divergence in their sequence and/or expression patterns. Qualitative complementary expression, or reciprocal expression, is when only one copy is expressed in some organ or tissue types and only the other copy is expressed in others, indicative of regulatory subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization. From analyses of two microarray data sets with 83 different organ types, developmental stages, and cell types in Arabidopsis thaliana, we determined that 30 % of whole-genome duplicate pairs and 38 % of tandem duplicate pairs show reciprocal expression patterns. We reconstructed the ancestral <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>expression</b> patterns to infer that considerably more cases of reciprocal expression resulted from gain of a new expression pattern (regulatory neofunctionalization) than from partitioning of ancestral expression patterns (regulatory subfunctionalization). Pollen was an especially common organ type for expression gain, resulting in contrasting expression of some duplicates in pollen. Many of the gene pairs with reciprocal expression showed asymmetric sequence rate evolution, consistent with neofunctionalization, and the more rapidly evolving copy often showed a more restricted expression pattern. A gene with reciprocal expression in pollen, involved in brassinosteroid signal transduction, has evolved more rapidly than its paralog, and it shows evidence for a new function in pollen. This study indicates the evolutionary importance of reciprocal expression patterns between gene duplicates, showing that they are common, often associated with regulatory neofunctionalization, and may be a factor allowing for retention and divergence of duplicated genes...|$|E
40|$|Strong {{antigenic}} encounter by T cells rapidly induces immunological synapse {{formation and}} surface T cell receptor (TCR) downregulation. Although surface TCR expression can remain low for several days, T cells can still sustain antigenic signaling. It has been unclear whether prolonged antigenic signaling {{occurs in the}} absence of surface TCR replenishment, being maintained by a few “nondownregulatable ” surface TCRs that might reside in a synaptosomal structure. Alternatively, the low surface TCR level induced by antigen might represent a dynamic <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>expression</b> involving continual surface TCR replenishment, reengagement by antigen, and ongoing downregulation. To resolve this issue, we studied in vivo–generated, dual-specificity primary naive CD 4 � T cells. On these cells, antigenic stimulus exclusively downregulated antigen-specific, but not antigen-nonspecific, TCRs. In addition to providing a means to track TCR engagement, this also allowed us to use the antigen nonspecific TCR to track TCR expression in isolation from TCR engagement by antigen. Surface TCR replenishment began within the first day of stimulation, and occurred synchronously with continuous antigen-specific TCR engagement and downregulation. Furthermore, by enhancing CD 25 expression, extended signaling through surface-replenishing TCRs significantly amplified the number of daughter cells generated by naive CD 4 � T cells that had already committed to proliferate. This effect required TCR engagement and could not be substituted for by interleukin 2. These data demonstrate that TCR triggering and consumption can occur {{over an extended period of}} time, with a significant impact on the effector responses evoked from naive CD 4 � T cells.

40|$|Definition and {{characterization}} {{of the role of}} Epigenetic mechanisms have gained immense momentum since the completion of the Human Genome Project. The human epigenetic layer, made up of DNA methylation and multiple histone protein modifications, (the key elements of epigenetic mechanisms), is known to act as a switchboard that regulates the occurrence of most cellular events. In multicellular organisms such as humans, all cells have identical genomic contents but vary in DNA Methylation (DM) profile with the result that different types of cells perform a spectrum of functions. DM within the genome is associated with tight control of gene expression, parental imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, long-term silencing of repetitive elements and chromatin condensation. Recently, considerable evidence has been put forward to demonstrate that environmental stress implicitly alters normal interactions among key epigenetic elements inside the genome. Aberrations in the spread of DM especially hypo/hyper methylation supported by an abnormal landscape of histone modifications have been strongly associated with Cancer initiation and development. While new findings on the impact of these key elements are reported regularly, precise information on how DM is controlled and its relation to networks of histone modifications is lacking. This has motivated modelling of DNA methylation and histone modifications and their interdependence. We describe initial computational methods used to investigate these key elements of epigenetic change, and to assess related information contained in DNA sequence patterns. We then describe attempts to develop a phenomenological epigenetic "micromodel", based on Markov-Chain Monte Carlo principles. This theoretical micromodel ("EpiGMP") aims to explore the effect of histome modifications and gene expression for defined levels of DNA methylation. We apply this micromodel to (i) test networks of genes in colon cancer (extracted from an in-house database, StatEpigen), and (ii) to help define an agent-based modelling framework to explore chromatin remodelling (or the dynamics of physical rearrangements), inside the human genome. Parallelization techniques to address issues of scale during the application of this micromodel have been adopted as well. A generic tool of this kind can potentially be applied to predict molecular events that affect the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>expression</b> of any gene during the onset or progress of cancer. Ultimately, the goal is to provide additional information on ways in which these low level molecular changes determine physical traits for mormal and disease conditions in an organism...|$|E
40|$|A {{vast amount}} of gene {{expression}} data is available to biological researchers. As of October 2010, the GEO database has 45, 777 chips of publicly available gene expression pro ling data from the Affymetrix (HGU 133 v 2) GeneChip platform, representing 2. 5 billion numerical measurements. Given this wealth of data, `meta-analysis' methods allowing inferences to be made from combinations of samples from different experiments are critically important. This thesis explores the application of localized pattern-mining approaches, as exemplified by biclustering, for large-scale gene expression analysis. Biclustering methods are particularly attractive {{for the analysis of}} large compendia of gene expression data as they allow the extraction of relationships that occur only across subsets of genes and samples. Standard correlation methods, however, assume a single correlation relationship between two genes occurs across all samples in the data. There are a number of existing biclustering methods, but as these did not prove suitable for large scale analysis, a novel method named `IslandCluster' was developed. This method provided a framework for investigating the results of different approaches to biclustering meta-analysis. The biclustering methods used in this work involve preprocessing of gene expression data into a unified scale in order to assess the significance of expression patterns. A novel discretisation approach is shown to identify distinct classes of genes' expression values more appropriately than approaches reported in the literature. A Gene Expression State Transformation (`GESTr') introduced as the first reported modelling of the biological <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>expression</b> on a unified scale and is shown to facilitate effective meta-analysis. Localised co-dependency analysis is introduced, a paradigm for identifying transcriptional relationships from gene expression data. Tools implementing this analysis were developed and used to analyse specificity of transcriptional relationships, to distinguish related subsets within a set of transcription factor (TF) targets and to tease apart combinatorial regulation of a set of targets by multiple TFs. The state of pluripotency, from which a mammalian cell has the potential to differentiate into any cell from any of the three adult germ layers, is maintained by forced expression of Nanog and may be induced from a non-pluripotent state by the expression of Oct 4, Sox 2, Klf 4 and cMyc. Analysis of cMyc regulatory targets shed light on a recent proposition that cMyc induces an `embryonic stem cell like' transcriptional signature outside embryonic stem (ES) cells, revealing a cMyc-responsive subset of the signature and identifying ES cell expressed targets with evidence of broad cMyc-induction. Regulatory targets through which cMyc, Oct 4, Sox 2 and Nanog may maintain or induce pluripotency were identified, offering insight into transcriptional mechanisms involved in the control of pluripotency and demonstrating the utility of the novel analysis approaches presented in this work...|$|E

These results suggest that GATA-GT 1 and GATA-GT 2 together with H+K+-ATPase are transcribed specifically in gastric parietal cells and that the two DNA-binding proteins may have important roles in cell specific gene regulation. Furthermore, we could detect parietal cells in different <b>states</b> <b>of</b> gene <b>expression...</b>|$|R
