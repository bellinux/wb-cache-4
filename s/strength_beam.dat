In this paper, based on the analysis of the vibration theory of the equal <b>strength</b> <b>beam,</b> the principle of FBG vibration tuning based on the equal intensity beam is derived. According to the practical application of the project, the structural dimensions of the equal <b>strength</b> <b>beam</b> are determined, and the optimization design of the vibrator is carried out. The finite element analysis of the sensor is carried out by ANSYS, and the first order resonant frequency is 94.739 Hz. The vibration test of the sensor is carried out by using the vibration frequency of 35 Hz and the vibration source of 50 Hz. The time domain and frequency domain analysis results of test data show that the sensor has good dynamic response characteristics, which can realize the accurate monitoring of the vibration frequency and meet the special requirements of vibration monitoring of hydraulic pump under specific environment.|$|E

The experiment makes a stress measurement of a loading aluminum alloy 3003 equal <b>strength</b> <b>beam</b> with the traditional electrical measuring method and the X-ray stress measurement. With the electrical measuring method as reference, the research study the measured values that acquired from the X-ray diffraction method when the diffraction angle are 142 ° and 156 °, and then compare them with that acquired from electrical measuring method. The measurement results demonstrate that the diffraction angle at 156 ° is better than at 142 ° based on the assessment standards of the liner slope {{and the distribution of}} data. Thus the optimum diffrac-tion angle for X-ray to measure the macroscopic stress of aluminum alloy 3003 is 156 °. In this pa-per，the stress caused by the load on the equal <b>strength</b> <b>beam</b> is assumed to be "residual stress " and thus the conclusion has reference values for the standardization of residual stress measurement of aluminum alloy by XRD and has theoretical guiding significance in the production practices...|$|E

40|$|The {{object of}} this {{investigation}} was to obtain information on the strength and behavior of reinforced concrete beams subjected to rapid loading. To this end, 33 beams of various strengths, 6 by 12 inches in cross section and 9 feet or 12 feet- 8 inches in span were tested under static and dynamic loads. Three percentages of tension reinforcement were employed using intermediate grade steel. Some beams also had compression and/ or shear reinforcement. Concrete <b>strength,</b> <b>beam</b> width and depth, and yield strength of reinforcement were essentially constant. Eight of the two-point loaded beams were tested statically, requiring from about two to six minutes each to reach collapse deflection. In the dynamic tests of the other 25 beams, loads were applied in from 0. 1 to 0. 8 times the natural period of vibration of the beam. Some of the dynamic loads were of "infinite" duration, while others were terminated at from one-half to three times the beam period. The load levels varied from less than static yield capacity to more than dynamic ultimate capacity. The analysis of the test results consists of determining the dynamic resistance characteristics of the test beams. This was accomplished by considering the beam. to be a single-degree-of-freedom system and analyzing its behavior on an analog computer. The measured load pulse was fed into the computer along with an arbitrary resistance function for the beam. This resistance function was then changed until its response matched the response measured in the test. Dynamic resistance functions were also determined using the strain rates measured in some of the tests together with the available results of dynamic tests of coupons of reinforcing bars. The resistance functions determined with the analog computer are compared with the computed functions and with the static load- deflection characteristics. An analytical procedure for the determination of the dynamic resistance of reinforced concrete beams is proposed which involves the use of the deflection rate at yield. The most important conclusions concern the direct relation between the dynamic yield level of a reinforced concrete beam and the yield strength of the tension reinforcement under dynamic loading; the apparently small effect that dynamic loading has on the collapse deflection of reinforced concrete beams; and the feasibility of using established formulas, developed in connection with static tests, for the prediction of dynamic resistance provided proper account is taken of the increase in yield strength of the reinforcing steel.
