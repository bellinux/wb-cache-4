40|$|A {{hardware}} R&D for the C-band (5712 MHz) rf {{system for}} a linear collider started in 1996 as a KEK research program. The first high-power test is scheduled for 1997. An accelerating gradient of 31 MV/m (including beam loading) will be generated by 50 MW C-band klystrons in combination with an rf-compression system. The klystron and its power supply can be fabricated by conventional technology. The <b>straightness</b> <b>tolerance</b> for the accelerating structures is 30 m m, which is also achievable with conventional fabrication processes. No critical new technology is required in a C-band system. Therefore, a reliable system can be constructed at low cost {{with a minimum of}} R&D studies. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Because of {{the high}} {{precision}} in roundness, straightness and roughness, {{it is very difficult}} to machining the inner surface of injection nozzle. Honing machine is the main equipment for machining the injection nozzle. The key honing control techniques and honing test for injection nozzle on the developed high precision vertical honing machine are analyzed. The quantitative expansion，which is one of the most important feeding styles in honing process, is discussed in detail. Some machining tests on the developed honing machine are made and the work pieces of injection nozzles with inner surface Φ 11 mm are honed successfully with roundness tolerance less than 0. 4 µm, <b>straightness</b> <b>tolerance</b> less than 1 µm and roughness tolerance less than 0. 04 µm...|$|E
40|$|HOM-free linear {{acceleration}} structure using the choke mode cavity (damped cavity) {{is now under}} design for e+e- linear collider project at C-band frequency (5712 MHz). Since this structure shows powerful damping effect on most of all HOMs, there is no multibunch problem due to long range wakefields. The structure will be equipped with the microwave absorbers in each cells and also the in-line dummy load {{in the last few}} cells. The <b>straightness</b> <b>tolerance</b> for 1. 8 m long structure is looser than 30 m m for 25 % emittance dilution limit, which can be achieved by standard machining and braising techniques. Since it has good vacuum pumping conductance through annular gaps in each cell, instabilities due to the interaction of beam with the residual-gas and ions can be minimized. I...|$|E
50|$|Deep hole {{drilling}} is generally achievable {{with a few}} tooling methods, usually gun drilling or BTA drilling. These are differentiated due to the coolant entry method (internal or external) and chip removal method (internal or external). Using methods such as a rotating tool and counter-rotating workpiece are common techniques to achieve required <b>straightness</b> <b>tolerances.</b> Secondary tooling methods include trepanning, skiving and burnishing, pull boring, or bottle boring. Finally {{a new kind of}} drilling technology is available to face this issue: vibration drilling. This technology breaks up the chips by a small controlled axial vibration of the drill. The small chips are easily removed by the flutes of the drill.|$|R
50|$|Deep hole {{drilling}} {{is defined as}} a hole depth greater than ten times the diameter of the hole. These types of holes require special equipment to maintain the <b>straightness</b> and <b>tolerances.</b> Other considerations are roundness and surface finish.|$|R
40|$|In 1977 {{tests were}} {{established}} of 141 open-pollinated families of selected plus-trees, {{and also of}} some unselected trees, of Eucalyptus regnans F. Muell. Several Australian provenances and New Zealand exotic populations were represented. The tests were assessed in June 1980 (3 years from seed sowing) for height growth, resistance to Mycosphaerella leaf blotch disease, branching quality, and stem <b>straightness.</b> Frost <b>tolerance</b> was assessed in 1978. Family differences (including provenance effects) were most pronounced in height growth, disease resistance, and frost tolerance. Phenotypic correlations between traits were mostly favourable, facilitating simultaneous selection of families for fast growth, good frost-tolerance, and disease resistance, as well as improved branching quality and stem straightness. Based on these early results, a clonal seed orchard has been established from grafts of 8 of the 55 original New Zealand plus-trees and of 34 new second-generation plus-trees selected from within the family tests. In addition, a seedling seed orchard has been established using bulked seedling progeny of 30 selected families (23 New Zealand, 7 Australian) ...|$|R
40|$|We are {{interested}} in obtaining the long-range, dipole wakefield of a linac structure with internal misalignments. The NLC linac structure is composed {{of a collection of}} cups that are brazed together, and such a calculation, for example, is important in setting the <b>straightness</b> <b>tolerance</b> for the composite structure. Our derivation, presented here, is technically applicable only to structures for which all modes are trapped. The modes will be trapped at least at the ends of the structure, if the connecting beam tubes have sufficiently small radii and the dipole modes do not couple to the fundamental mode couplers in the end cells. For detuned structures (DS), like those in the injector linacs of the JLC/NLC[1], most modes are trapped internally within a structure, and those that do extend to the ends couple only weakly to the beam; for such structures the results here can also be applied, even if the conditions on the beam tube radii and the fundamental mode coupler do not hold. We believe that even for the damped, detuned structures (DDS) of the main linac of the JLC/NLC[2], which are similar, though they hav...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{important}} variables {{in the design of}} the end cap calorimeter is the number of angular divisions that should be made in the face of the calorimeter array. While it would be ideal to have no such divisions, they are unavoidable because the maximum size for uranium sheets is less than the diameter of the array. These divisions create regions which are either partially or totally devoid of absorber and readout. It is the purpose of this note to analyze the effects of different parameters on the size of these cracks. This analysis assumes wedge shaped structures of significant depth (i. e. > 20 % of the total depth). For such modules there are five variables which affect the size of a crack. They are: (1) The clearance between modules. The extent to which the module wall and the array extend into this region depends on the tolerances on the manufacture of the module. All of the module construction techniques currently under consideration have very tight tolerances (e. g. 2 mils). Therefore, this region is assumed to be void of solid material. In the C. C this region is thought to be. 090 inches wide. (2) The thickness of the module walls. The wall thickness depends on which module is discussed. Design thicknesses range from. 078 inches in the C. C. modules to. 150 inches in the E. C leakage modules. Because tight tolerances are assumed on the construction of the modules the skin is assumed to be perfectly flat. (3) The dimension tolerance on the uranium width. The effect of the dimension tolerance varies depending on the location of the module. Modules near the a o'clock and 9 o'clock position will see a gray zone equal to the dimension tolerance at the top of each module. There will be a solid black zone at the bottom of each module. This results from gravity pulling the uranium plates down to touch the lower wall of the module. Modules near the 6 o'clock and 12 o'clock region will see a gray zone equal to the dimension tolerance at both edges of a module since there are no plans for a mechanism to insure their alignment along one wall. (4) The <b>straightness</b> <b>tolerance</b> on the plate edges. The <b>straightness</b> <b>tolerance</b> creates a gray zone equal to its width along each side of a module. (5) The region of reduced signal pickup. The extent of this region is not yet well understood. The current design requires an area along the edge of the module which does not have resistive coat. The width of this region has not been determined. Some portion of this region should still collect all of the signal. The size of this region is not known, either. As an example we can use the tolerances currently achieved for the Harvard plates at Rocky Flats. The width tolerance requested was + 0. 000, - 0. 020 inches. Rocky Flats is delivering plates with a width tolerance of + 0. 000, - 0. 040 inch. There is no tolerance on the straightness of the datum edge. If we assume that. 010 inch of the. 040 inch tolerance is do to straightness variation then we can determine the crack sizes for a C. C. E. M. module...|$|E
40|$|The {{prototype}} steam generating {{heavy water}} moderated reactor incorporates Zircaloy- 2 pressure tubes 0. 2 in thick, 5. 14 in internal diameter and 15 ft long to a <b>straightness</b> <b>tolerance</b> of 1 / 3000, and zirconium- 2 +~ 4 niobium alloy tubes 0. 12 in thick. Prior {{to the construction}} of this reactor, zirconium alloy tubes of these dimensions had not been made, and this paper describes the programme of work leading to the successful manufacture of such tubes. Mechanical properties, both at room and the design temperature of 30 O 0 C, were evaluated to confirm the pre-liminary choice of design stress, and appropriate corrosion testing led to the definition of corrosion allowances. Additionally, attention was paid to the details of the manufacturing process which can affect those properties that influence economic tube operating life. During service, hydrogen is absorbed by the pressure tube from the corrosion reaction, and this can affect mechanical properties. The magnitude of this d e f t is dependent on hydrogen content, distribution, and morphology. Irradiation also affects mechanical properties, and in particular it raises the tensile strength and reduces the energy absorbed in a notch impact test. Investigation of these effects has {{led to the development of}} new testing techniques to assess the consequences of hydrogen and irradiation on tube life. This development, and the implications of the test results, are discussed in the paper. In the case of the Zr- 24 ' 34 Nb alloy, an ultimate tensile strength at 300 °C in excess of 90 OOO Ib/in 2 can be obtained by water quenching from 850 °C and subsequently tempering at 500 "C, but this heat treatment has had to be optimized to give a balance between the strength and corrosion requirements. The experimental work leading to the optimization of the heat treatment is described and the properties of full-sized pressure tubes detailed. The paper concludes with a brief mention of future developments aimed at giving improved performance...|$|E
40|$|Blade design aspects most {{affecting}} producibility {{and means}} of measurement and control of length, scallop, fullness and <b>straightness</b> requirements and <b>tolerances</b> were extensively considered. Alternate designs of the panel seams and edge reinforcing members are believed to offer advantages of seam integrity, producibility, reliability, cost and weight. Approaches to and requirements for highly specialized metalizing methods, processes and equipment were studied and identified. Alternate methods of sail blade fabrication and related special machinery, tooling, fixtures and trade offs were examined. A preferred and recommended approach is also described. Quality control plans, inspection procedures, flow charts and special test equipment associated with the preferred manufacturing method were analyzed and are discussed...|$|R
