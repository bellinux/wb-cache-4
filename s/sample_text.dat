40|$|Creationism is a religiously {{motivated}} worldview {{in denial}} of biological evolution {{that has been}} very resistant to change. We performed a textual analysis by examining creationist and pro-evolutionary texts for aspects of "experiential thinking", a cognitive process different from scientific thought. We observed characteristics of experiential thinking as follows: testimonials (present in 100 % of <b>sampled</b> creationist <b>texts),</b> such as quotations, were a major form of proof. Confirmation bias (100 % of <b>sampled</b> <b>texts)</b> was represented by ignoring or dismissing information that would contradict the creationist hypothesis. Scientifically irrelevant or flawed information was re-interpreted as relevant for the falsification of evolution (75 - 90 % of <b>sampled</b> <b>texts).</b> Evolutionary theory was associated to moral issues by demonizing scientists and linking evolutionary theory to atrocities (63 - 93 % of <b>sampled</b> <b>texts).</b> Pro-evolutionary rebuttals of creationist claims also contained testimonials (93 % of <b>sampled</b> <b>texts)</b> and referred to moral implications (80 % of <b>sampled</b> <b>texts)</b> but displayed lower prevalences of stereotypical thinking (47 % of <b>sampled</b> <b>texts),</b> confirmation bias (27 % of <b>sampled</b> <b>texts)</b> and pseudodiagnostics (7 % of <b>sampled</b> <b>texts).</b> The aspects of experiential thinking could also be interpreted as argumentative fallacies. Testimonials lead, for instance, to ad hominem and appeals to authorities. Confirmation bias and simplification of data give rise to hasty generalizations and false dilemmas. Moral issues lead to guilt by association and appeals to consequences. Experiential thinking and fallacies can contribute to false beliefs and {{the persistence of the}} claims. We propose that science educators would benefit from the systematic analysis of experiential thinking patterns and fallacies in creationist texts and pro-evolutionary rebuttals in order to concentrate on scientific misconceptions instead of the scientifically irrelevant aspects of the creationist-evolutionist debate...|$|R
40|$|The {{main concern}} {{of the present study}} was to compare the {{readability}} level of English textbooks for translation courses and their Persian translations using two readability formulas: the Gunning Fog Index (GFI) and the Flesch New Reading Ease (FNRE) Formula. To this end a corpus comprising five textbooks for translation studies and their Persian translations were chosen. The reason behind choosing these textbooks is that they are the only translation textbooks translated into Persian and they are sources frequently referred to, by lower proficient students. Two hundred and eighty four <b>sample</b> <b>texts</b> were chosen randomly and examined in terms of readability levels by GFI; one hundred and forty two <b>sample</b> <b>texts</b> from English textbooks of translation and one hundred and forty two <b>sample</b> <b>texts</b> which were the translations of the respective English <b>sample</b> <b>texts.</b> A total number of thirty <b>sample</b> <b>texts</b> which were chosen from two hundred and eighty four samples were also examined by FNR...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the system {{developed by the}} Language Technologies Laboratory of INAOE for the Geographical Information Retrieval task of CLEF 2008. The pre-sented system focuses {{on the problem of}} ranking documents in accordance to their geographical relevance. It is mainly based on the following hypotheses: (i) current IR machines are able to retrieve relevant documents for geographic queries, but they can not generate a pertinent ranking; and (ii) complete documents provide more and better elements for the ranking process than isolated query terms. Based on these hy-potheses, our participation at GeoCLEF 2008 aimed to demonstrate that using some query-related <b>sample</b> <b>texts</b> it is possible to improve the final ranking of the retrieved documents. Experimental results indicated that our approach could improve the MAP of some sets of retrieved documents using only an average of two <b>sample</b> <b>texts.</b> These results also showed that the proposed approach is very sensitive to the presence of irrelevant <b>sample</b> <b>texts</b> {{as well as to the}} ambiguity of geographical terms...|$|R

The Ethnologue also mentions that mutual intelligibility may even be problematic between different subdialects within Arvanitika. Mutual intelligibility between Standard Tosk and Arvanitika is higher than that between the two main dialect groups within Albanian, Tosk and Gheg.

Collocation map is a sigmoid belief network that can be constructed from bigrams. We compared the conditional probabilities and mutual information computed from bigrams and Collocation map.
