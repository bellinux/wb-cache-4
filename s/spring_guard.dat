Plants and birds and humble creatures Well accept her rule austere; Titan-born, to hardy natures Cold is genial and dear.

Hogtown settlement is also mentioned in documents of the early nineteenth century which discuss land grants issued by the Spanish crown during the Second Spanish Period in Florida´s history (1783 - 1821). In the late 1820 ´s Hogtown became a white settlement as American pioneers occupied Indian land from which the Seminoles had been removed by the terms of the Treaty of Moultrie Creek. In 1854, the town of Gainesville was founded on a site located a few miles east of Hogtown. Fort Hogtown During the Second Seminole War (1835 - 42), a settler´s fort was built at the Hogtown settlement near this site.

As they got more into the open, they rushed round and clambered over the stockade; and the enemy, unable to stand the fury of their charge, fled in panic.|$|R

5000|$|The 1832 Treaty of Payne's Landing {{required}} the Seminoles in Florida {{to move to}} west of the Mississippi River after three years. Most of the Seminoles {{did not want to}} leave Florida. As the deadline {{for the start of the}} removal approached, tensions increased in Florida. In June 1835 there occurred an incident called the [...] "Murder of Hogtown" [...] (not to be confused with a work of fiction so titled): A party of seven or eight Seminoles hunting off of the reservation had killed a cow and then made camp near Hogtown. A group of whites found five or six of the Seminoles at their camp, seized their weapons, and began whipping the Seminoles. The other two Seminoles returned to the camp, and seeing their fellows being whipped, opened fire on the whites. In the ensuing fight, three of the whites were wounded, one Seminole was killed, and another Seminole was reported to have been mortally wounded. Indian Agent Wiley Thompson demanded the surrender of the surviving Seminoles, and they were turned over to government custody for trial. There is no record of a trial occurring, however, reportedly because the whites involved did not want their actions examined in court. In August, Private Kinsley Dalton was killed while carrying the mail from Fort Brooke (Tampa) to Fort King (Ocala), allegedly in retaliation for the Seminoles killed at Hogtown. The Second Seminole War started late in December 1835, when 107 United States Army troops were killed by Seminoles in the Dade Massacre. White settlers throughout Florida left their homes or took steps to protect themselves. The residents of Hogtown built a fortification called Fort Hogtown, and were part of the <b>Spring</b> Grove <b>Guards</b> (<b>Spring</b> Grove was about 4 mi west of Hogtown).|$|R

A few days after a May 2 engagement at Old Dad Mountain, the heads cut off of the three natives killed there, were placed on display with those hung on the gibbet at Bitter Springs. On May 28, following reports of the display in the San Francisco press and after General Clarke had read Carlton's dispatch telling of the display of severed heads at Bitter Spring, Clarke ordered Carleton to cease mutilating the dead and remove all evidence of the mutilation from public gaze.
