5|$|Benefitting {{from the}} advent of postcards, Mary Willumsen (1884–1961) photographed women in <b>scanty</b> {{clothing}} or nude at the Helgoland beach facility in Copenhagen. Between 1916 and 1920, she took many such photographs which she sold at a nearby kiosk. The operation was discontinued when the police began to take an interest. Many of the compositions are now considered to have considerable artistic merit.|$|E
5|$|Chocolina was {{originally}} {{meant to be}} a waitress in Serendipity, but her design impressed Toriyama enough that he expanded her role into something akin to a shop clerk, and the director wrote a new backstory and new dialogue for her. Isamu Kamikokuryo said that though Chocolina's jovial manner and <b>scanty</b> outfit at times clashed with the game's overall atmosphere, he felt she was a good inclusion. Chocolina is voiced by Julie Nathanson in English and Seiko Ueda in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Gibraltar was {{fortified}} for {{the first}} time in 1160 by the Almohad Sultan Abd al-Mu'min in response to the coastal threat posed by the Christian kings of Aragon and Castile. Gibraltar was renamed Jebel al-Fath (the Mount of Victory), though this name did not persist, and a fortified town named Medinat al-Fath (the City of Victory) was laid out on the upper slopes of the Rock. It is unclear how much of Medinat al-Fath was actually built, as the surviving archaeological remains are <b>scanty.</b>|$|E
60|$|The three {{got under}} way again, {{proceeding}} carefully, {{so as not to}} raise the dust, and headed due southwest. <b>Scantier</b> and <b>scantier</b> grew the grass; the hollows were washes of sand; steely gray dunes, like long, flat, ocean swells, ribbed the prairie. The gray day declined. Late into the purple night they traveled, then camped without fire.|$|R

5|$|In Europe, 17-year-old Brigitte Bardot wore <b>scanty</b> bikinis (by {{contemporary}} standards) in the French film Manina, la fille sans voiles ("Manina, {{the girl}} unveiled"). The promotion for the film, released in France in March 1953, drew {{more attention to}} Bardot's bikinis than to the film itself. By the time the film was released in the United States in 1958 it was re-titled Manina, the Girl in the Bikini. Bardot was also photographed wearing a bikini on the beach during the 1953 Cannes Film Festival. Working {{with her husband and}} agent Roger Vadim she garnered significant attention with photographs of her wearing a bikini on every beach in the south of France.|$|E
5|$|Pagan priests, too, were {{interested}} in suppressing any threat to traditional religion. The Christian Arnobius, writing during Diocletian's reign, attributes financial concerns to provisioners of pagan services:The augurs, the dream interpreters, the soothsayers, the prophets, and the priestlings, ever vain...fearing that their own arts be brought to nought, and that they may extort but <b>scanty</b> contributions from the devotees, now few and infrequent, cry aloud, 'The gods are neglected, and in the temples {{there is now a}} very thin attendance. Former ceremonies are exposed to derision, and the time-honoured rites of institutions once sacred have sunk before the superstitions of new religions.'They believed their ceremonies were hindered by the presence of Christians, who were thought to cloud the sight of oracles and stall the gods' recognition of their sacrifices.|$|E
5|$|A {{study from}} Currie, Horner, Erickson and Longrich in 2010 {{has been put}} forward as {{evidence}} of cannibalism in the genus Tyrannosaurus. They studied some Tyrannosaurus specimens with tooth marks in the bones, attributable to the same genus. The tooth marks were identified in the humerus, foot bones and metatarsals, and this was seen as evidence for opportunistic scavenging, rather than wounds caused by intraspecific combat. In a fight, they proposed {{it would be difficult}} to reach down to bite in the feet of a rival, making it more likely that the bite marks were made in a carcass. As the bite marks were made in body parts with relatively <b>scanty</b> amounts of flesh, it is suggested that the Tyrannosaurus was feeding on a carcass in which the more fleshy parts had already been consumed. They were also open to the possibility that other tyrannosaurids practiced cannibalism. Other evidence for cannibalism has been unearthed.|$|E

5|$|The {{skeletal}} reconstruction {{accompanying the}} 1908 description restored the missing parts {{in a fashion}} similar to Stegosaurus, and Brown likened the result to the extinct armored mammal Glyptodon. Contrary to modern depictions, Brown's stegosaur-like reconstruction showed robust forelimbs, a strongly arched back, a pelvis with prongs projecting forwards from the ilium and pubis, {{as well as a}} short, drooping tail without a tail club, which was unknown at the time. Brown also reconstructed the armor plates in parallel rows running down the back; this arrangement was purely hypothetical. Brown's reconstruction became highly influential, and restorations of the animal based on his diagram were published as late as the 1980s. In a 1908 review of Brown's Ankylosaurus description, American paleontologist Samuel Wendell Williston criticised the skeletal reconstruction as being based on too <b>scanty</b> remains, and claimed that Ankylosaurus was merely a synonym of the genus Stegopelta, which Williston had named in 1905. Williston also stated that a skeletal reconstruction of the related Polacanthus by Hungarian paleontologist Franz Nopcsa was a better example of how ankylosaurs would have appeared in life. The claim of synonymy was not accepted by other researchers, and the two genera are now considered distinct.|$|E
5|$|The text {{virtually}} ignores {{his wife}} and family, but Cibber wrote in detail about {{his time in the}} theatre, especially his early years as a young actor at Drury Lane in the 1690s, giving a vivid account of the cut-throat theatre company rivalries and chicanery of the time, as well as providing pen portraits of the actors he knew. The Apology is vain and self-serving, as both his contemporaries and later commentators have pointed out, but it also serves as Cibber's rebuttal to his harshest critics, especially Pope. For the early part of Cibber's career, it is unreliable in respect of chronology and other hard facts, understandably, since it was written 50 years after the events, apparently without the help of a journal or notes. Nevertheless, it is an invaluable source for all aspects of the early 18th-century theatre in London, for which documentation is otherwise <b>scanty.</b> Because he worked with many actors from the early days of Restoration theatre, such as Thomas Betterton and Elizabeth Barry {{at the end of their}} careers, and lived to see David Garrick perform, he is a bridge between the earlier mannered and later more naturalistic styles of performance.|$|E
5|$|Bows of {{any kind}} seldom survive in the archaeological record. Composite bows may have been invented first by the nomads of the Asiatic steppe, who may have based it on earlier Northern Asian {{laminated}} bows. However, archaeological investigation of the Asiatic steppe is still limited and patchy; literary records {{of any kind}} are late and <b>scanty</b> and seldom mention details of bows. There are arrowheads from the earliest chariot burials at Krivoye Lake, part of the Sintashta culture about 2100–1700 BCE, but the bow that shot them has not survived. Other sites of the Sintashta culture have produced finds of horn and bone, interpreted as furniture (grips, arrow rests, bow ends, string loops) of bows; {{there is no indication}} that the bending parts of these bows included anything other than wood. These finds are associated with short arrows, 50–70cm long, and the bows themselves may have been correspondingly short. The Andronovo Culture, descendant of the Sintashta culture, was the first to extend from the Ural Mountains to Tian Shan, and its successor cultures gave rise to the Indo-Aryan migration. It has been suggested that the Srubna culture (contemporaneous with, and a neighbour to, the Andronovo culture) used composite bows, but no archaeological evidence is known.|$|E
