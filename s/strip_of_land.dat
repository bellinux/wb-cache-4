5|$|The {{lighthouse}} is on {{a narrow}} <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> that separates the sea from Tuggerah Lake.|$|E
5|$|The first {{records of}} Herm's {{inhabitants}} in historic times {{are from the}} 6th century, when the island became a centre of monastic activity; the followers of Saint Tugual (also called Tudwal) arrived, establishing Saint Tugual's Chapel. In 709, a storm washed away the <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> which connected the island with Jethou.|$|E
5|$|South India is a {{peninsula}} in {{the shape}} of an inverted triangle bound by the Arabian Sea on the west, by the Bay of Bengal on the east and Vindhya and Satpura ranges on the north. The Narmada river flows westwards in the depression between the Vindhya and Satpura ranges which define the northern spur of the Deccan plateau. The Western Ghats run parallel along the western coast and the narrow <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> between the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea forms the Konkan region. The Western Ghats continue south until Kanyakumari. The Eastern Ghats run parallel along the eastern coast and the <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> between the Eastern Ghats and the Bay of Bengal forms the Coromandel region. Both the ranges meet at the Nilgiri mountains. The Nilgiris run in a crescent approximately along the borders of Tamil Nadu with northern Kerala and Karnataka, encompassing the Palakkad and Wayanad hills and the Sathyamangalam ranges, extending on to the relatively low-lying hills of the Eastern Ghats on the western portion of the Tamil Nadu–Andhra Pradesh border forming the Tirupati and Annamalai hills.|$|E
50|$|No residence, business, or office, {{except the}} two {{buildings}} of the station proper, stands on the two <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> separating the railroad right-of-way from Hobart Avenue on the westbound side and Chatham Road on the eastbound. This is an intentional policy that carries forward from Stewart Hartshorn's original directive that no development ever take place on those <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>land.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Through the Desert (Into the Desert {{in older}} edition) {{is similar to}} The Four Islands, but {{consists}} of a large continent and smaller outlying islands. On the large island, there exists a [...] "wall of deserts" [...] that separates the island into a large main area and separate smaller <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>land.</b> As {{the name of the}} scenario implies, expanding through the desert into these smaller <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>land,</b> or by sea to the outlying islands, award bonus victory points.|$|R
50|$|Elephant {{corridors}} are narrow <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> {{that allow}} elephants {{to move from}} one habitat patch to another. There are 88 identified elephant corridors in India.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Saxon immigration, the Székelys –Hungarian-speaking free warriors {{cultivating}} communal lands– were transferred to the southeast of the province. From the 13thcentury they were governed independently from the voivode by a royal official, the count of the Székelys. Besides the Saxons, the Cistercians became the agents of expansion in Transylvania. When their abbey at Cârţa was established in the early 13thcentury, Andrew II ordered that the <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> running up to the mountains between the rivers Olt, Cârţişoara and Arpaş be transferred from the Romanians to the new monastery.|$|E
5|$|However, most of {{the rocks}} {{have one thing in}} common; the rocks are {{generally}} hard and erosion-resistant. The Rocky Mountain Trench is thought to be a partial graben, or a long narrow <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> that has dropped in elevation over time because of parallel faults on both sides. Faults in the Kootenay River watershed trend north-northwest to south-southeast as is common in much of British Columbia. The underlying rock is generally stable and contains more outcroppings of metamorphic and igneous rock as one progresses westwards. Formations of Cambrian and Devonian rock also appear in small amounts in the U.S. portion of the Kootenay.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the land}} {{near the mouth of}} Mahoning Creek is developed. A <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> {{crossing}} the watershed in its central section is also developed. The southernmost part of the watershed is largely agricultural land. North of this is an area of mostly forested land and {{the central part of the}} watershed is mostly agricultural land. The northern part includes both forested and agricultural land. The fastest development in Montour County is occurring in the watershed of the creek.|$|E
50|$|The Operational Area of the Senoi Praaq {{dubbed the}} “Bamboo Operations Area” spans two <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> along the Main Range (Malaysia) from Thailand to Johor.|$|R
50|$|As large <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> {{might have}} to be {{converted}} to canals, a considerable population living in this areas must need to be rehabilitated to new areas.|$|R
50|$|Belvedere Lagoon is an {{artificial}} lagoon on San Francisco Bay in Belvedere in Marin County, California. Narrow <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> separate it from Richardson Bay (to the northwest) and Raccoon Strait.|$|R
5|$|On a {{strategic}} scale, a natural choke point was present between the northern shore of Lake Peipus and the Gulf of Finland. The 45 kilometre wide <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> was entirely bisected by the Narva River and had {{large areas of}} wilderness. The primary transportation routes, the Narva–Tallinn highway and railway, ran on an east-west axis near and parallel to the coastline. There were no other east-west transportation routes capable of sustaining troop movement {{on a large scale}} in the region.|$|E
5|$|Route22 {{continues}} heading northeast along {{a narrow}} <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> between the East Branch and Bog Brook reservoirs. It then resumes its northward heading, following a much straighter course {{than it had}} up to this point, on two lanes through wooded areas {{of the town of}} Patterson, where two local state highways, NY312 and 164, come in from the west. The highway gradually expands to three and sometimes four lanes as it passes through built-up areas of strip development. Shortly after intersecting a third state highway, NY311, and passing another strip plaza, NY22 crosses into Dutchess County.|$|E
5|$|SR11, named Chuckanut Drive for its whole route, {{begins at}} a partial {{cloverleaf}} interchange with I-5 north of Burlington. From the interchange, the highway travels northwest through farmland, closely paralleling a BNSF Railway route from Mount Vernon to Bellingham, also {{used by the}} Amtrak Cascades service. The road turns north to intersect Bow Hill Road, formerly SR237 until 1991, east of Edison. SR11 continues north to Blanchard, where it begins to traverse a narrow <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> between the Chuckanut Mountains and Samish Bay. Midway between Blanchard and the Skagit–Whatcom county line, the highway travels through a hairpin turn at Oyster Creek.|$|E
5000|$|TERCOM {{navigation}} [...] "maps" [...] {{consist of}} a series <b>of</b> <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> that the missile is expected to fly over, encoded {{as a series of}} altitudes. Since a radar altimeter measures distances, height over the ground, and not an absolute altitude, the maps generally encode a series of changes in altitude, not the absolute altitude itself. Additionally, the <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> {{on either side of the}} expected path are also stored. A series of such maps are produced, typically from data from radar mapping satellites. When flying over water, contour maps are replaced by magnetic field maps.|$|R
50|$|The {{ecoregion}} {{is in the}} neotropical realm, in {{the tropical}} and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome.The forests have many endemic species {{of plants and animals}} found only locally on mountain ridges or narrow <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>land.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On 3 September 2000 {{the army}} mounted a massive counteroffensive, named [...] "Agni Keila", to retake {{some of the}} LTTE-held {{territory}} {{to the south of}} its defensive lines, but after advancing a few kilometers the troops met heavy resistance. The army was hampered by the presence <b>of</b> two narrow <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> over which their forces had to advance. The LTTE had registered all its artillery and mortars onto this area. In addition, it had extensively booby-trapped the <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>land,</b> rendering them extremely dangerous for armored units. Although the army claimed that it managed to advance well into the LTTE lines, heavy casualties forced a withdrawal to its original positions.|$|R
5|$|Within 90 {{years of}} Osman I's {{establishment}} of the Ottoman beylik, Byzantine Asia Minor had ceased to exist and by ca. 1380, Byzantine Thrace was lost to the Ottomans. By ca. 1400, the once mighty Byzantine Empire {{was nothing more than}} a collection of the Despotate of the Morea, a few Aegean islands and a <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> in Thrace in the immediate vicinity of the Capital. The Crusade of Nicopolis in 1396, Timur's invasion in 1402 and the final Crusade of Varna in 1444 allowed a ruined Constantinople to stave off defeat until 1453. With the conclusion of the war Ottoman supremacy became established in the eastern Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|Bevelle, {{the spiritual}} {{center of the}} Yevon religion, lies on a thin <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> {{slightly}} north of Macalania. The city is built {{as a series of}} layers, with the headquarters of Yevon located at the top. The Via Purifico, located beneath Bevelle, serves as an oubliette for outcasts. Further north are the Calm Lands, a series of plains that have been the site of numerous battles in Spira's history; the Cavern of the Stolen Fayth, an equally historical area; and Mt. Gagazet, home of the Ronsos. Lastly, the sacred city of Zanarkand is on the northern tip of the Spiran mainland, reduced to ruins by Sin one thousand years before the events of Final Fantasy X.|$|E
5|$|From 25–30 July, the Croatian Army and Croatian Defence Council (HVO) troops {{attacked}} Serb-held territory {{north of}} Mount Dinara, capturing Bosansko Grahovo and Glamoč during Operation Summer '95. That offensive {{paved the way}} for the military recapture of occupied territory around Knin, as it severed the last efficient resupply route between Banja Luka and Knin. On 4 August, Croatia started Operation Storm, with the aim of recapturing almost all of the occupied territory in Croatia, except for a comparatively small <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>land,</b> located along the Danube, at a considerable distance from the bulk of the contested land. The offensive, involving 100,000 Croatian soldiers, was the largest single land battle fought in Europe since World War II. Operation Storm achieved its goals and was declared completed on 8 August.|$|E
50|$|The plateau and ridge {{comprises}} all {{the land}} that is suitable for urban development including extensive relatively flat land, the mountain piedmonts and plains, and long narrow watersheds and <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> which separate the rivers and streams.|$|R
50|$|Between 1825 and 1850, as {{settlers}} moved west, 25 American Indian tribes were {{relocated to}} Kansas. Two narrow <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> in present-day Kansas along the Missouri River were {{set aside for}} the Iowa tribe and the Sac & Foxes.|$|R
50|$|In {{irrigated}} lands with scarce {{water resources}} suffering from drainage (high water table) and soil salinity problems, strip cropping is sometimes practiced with <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> where every other strip is irrigated while the strips in between are left permanently fallow.|$|R
5|$|From Lexington Avenue, where NY390 passes {{into the}} town of Greece, north to NY104, NY390 runs {{parallel}} to {{the western edge of}} Eastman Business Park, the large production and distribution complex owned and maintained by Eastman Kodak. Midway between the Lexington Avenue and West Ridge Road exits, NY390 encounters Ridgeway Avenue via a partial diamond interchange. Just north of Ridgeway Avenue, the expressway crosses a small, narrow <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> that lies within the Rochester city limits, a carryover from when the Erie Canal occupied this tract and entered the city decades before. North of the strip, NY390 curves to the northeast, passing along {{the west side of the}} industrial park and the eastern edge of a residential yet wooded area to reach NY104. Heading northbound, it splits into two halves, with exit24A connecting to NY104 east and exit24B linking to NY104 west.|$|E
5|$|In 1894, King Leopold II and Great Britain {{signed the}} 1894 Anglo-Congolese treaty, which {{resulted}} in the exchange of a long <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> on {{the eastern side of the}} Congo for the Lado Enclave, leased to King Leopold II for the duration of his reign. This aided the British in pursuing the Cape to Cairo railway, as well as preventing the French from achieving an east-west line by putting the Belgians in their path. With the Lado Enclave, King Leopold gained direct access to Rejaf, the last outpost on the navigable Nile. Although the outbreak of the Mahdist War (1881–1899) had disrupted trade up and down the Nile river, Leopold hoped to gain Rejaf in preparation for its reopening once the Mahdist threat had been addressed.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, after {{receiving}} {{approval from the}} government, the Parks Commission began to expropriate land {{along the length of}} the river. The broadened <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> was used to construct a new paved parkway, which was opened in segments. The new parkway was ornamental and designed to be aesthetically pleasing, a prime consideration of road construction at that time. The section south of the falls was completed first, opening in 1912. It was extended north to the Whirlpool Rapids, incorporating the existing River Road, by 1915. The section between the rapids and Queenston was opened between 1921 and 1923. Finally, the remaining section between Queenston and Niagara-on-the-Lake opened in 1931, completing the present parkway.|$|E
5000|$|In 1852, Shattuck and Blake, and two {{partners}} {{they met in}} the gold fields, William Hillegass and James Leonard, claimed four adjoining 160 acre <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> {{in the area that}} became the central part of Berkeley. (See Kellersberger's Map) ...|$|R
50|$|This {{division}} <b>of</b> the <b>land</b> in Rundale {{was similar}} to medieval European practices that lasted in Ireland until the 19th century. Small <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> were cooperatively managed by extended groups of about 20 households, and were periodically re-distributed. As a result, a community-orientated society was created.|$|R
50|$|Kwigillingok Airport is {{the most}} {{dangerous}} airport that Alaskan commuter airline Ravn Alaska serves, with its sole runway boasting an incredibly narrow width of just over 40 feet. The runway is, essentially, on an island among the numerous creeks, rivers, and other water bodies that are common to the geographical region, as it spans a stretch <b>of</b> <b>land</b> roughly two thousand feet long and one hundred feet wide that connects to the mainland with sparsely placed, thin <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>land.</b> The apron, and the short taxiway to the apron, are both located on one <b>of</b> these thin <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>land,</b> making the taxiing of an aircraft extremely dangerous, as all parts of the airport have bodies of water that present a considerable hazard to aircraft on at least two sides.|$|R
5|$|In January 1934, Germany {{signed a}} non-aggression pact with Poland, which {{disrupted}} the French network of anti-German alliances in Eastern Europe. In March 1939, Hitler demanded {{the return of}} the Free City of Danzig and the Polish Corridor, a <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> that separated East Prussia from the rest of Germany. The British announced they would {{come to the aid of}} Poland if it was attacked. Hitler, believing the British would not actually take action, ordered an invasion plan should be readied for a target date of September 1939. On 23 May, Hitler described to his generals his overall plan of not only seizing the Polish Corridor but greatly expanding German territory eastward at the expense of Poland and he expected this time they would be met by force.|$|E
5|$|King Leopold II, the Belgian {{king and}} {{ruler of the}} Congo Free State, {{acquired}} the Lado Enclave in South Sudan from Britain in 1894 {{as part of a}} territory exchange which gave the British a <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> along the eastern Congo for Belgian access to the navigable Nile. However, the territory was overrun with Mahdist rebels who had established their stronghold at the town of Rejaf, which occupied a valuable position for trade along the Nile river. After a wave of new funding from the Belgian government in 1895, King Leopold ordered an expedition to be led into the Lado Enclave to expel the Mahdists and fortify Rejaf as a strategic military and trading outpost.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after {{entering}} Cayuga County, NY31 crosses {{and begins to}} parallel the New York State Thruway (I-90), which NY31 does {{for most of its}} routing west of the outer Syracuse suburbs. In Port Byron, NY31 intersects NY38 {{in the center of the}} village. The routes embark on an overlap through the village before separating near the eastern edge of Port Byron. NY31 continues alone to Weedsport, where the route meets NY34 and County Route31B (CR31B, formerly NY31B) north of the village. East of Weedsport, NY31 and the Thruway are joined by the CSX Rochester Subdivision mainline, which runs down the center of the <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> created by the Thruway to the north and NY31 to the south.|$|E
25|$|Little {{by little}} {{as they were}} handed down, the <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> {{became more and more}} narrow. Some were only a few metres wide by several {{kilometres}} long following the downward slope. Because of this, farming and access to parcels became more and more difficult.|$|R
50|$|Qalqilya and the Hableh area (including Ras Atiya and Izbat Jalud) are {{strictly}} speaking not enclaves, as narrow <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> connect them to areas {{east of the}} barrier. Periodically the Israeli military employ checkpoints to restrict access to these areas for security reasons.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} of the island is mountainous, sparsely inhabited and covered with forests of pine (Pinus brutia) and cypress (Cupressus sempervirens). While the shores are rocky, the island has arable <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> where citrus fruit, wine grapes, vegetables, olives and other crops are grown.|$|R
