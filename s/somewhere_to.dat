5|$|After the war, Bacher {{returned}} to Ithaca to head Cornell's Laboratory for Nuclear Studies. He agreed with Bethe that what Cornell needed {{to become a}} major player in high energy nuclear physics was a new synchrotron, but first he needed to find <b>somewhere</b> <b>to</b> put it. However, in 1946 Bacher was appointed to the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of the new United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, along with fellow United States representatives Tolman and Oppenheimer. Bacher therefore had to divide his time between Ithaca and New York City.|$|E
5|$|Somewhere premiered at the 67th Venice International Film Festival {{where it}} {{received}} the Golden Lion {{award for best}} picture. Critical opinion was mildly positive. Reviewers praised the patience of the film's visual style and its empathy {{for a handful of}} characters, but some found <b>Somewhere</b> <b>to</b> be too repetitive of themes in Coppola's previous work, or did not sympathize with the protagonist because of his relative success. It was released to theaters in the United Kingdom and Ireland on December 10, 2010, and in the United States on December 22, 2010.|$|E
5|$|After {{getting off}} the bed, the Hero is then given a task to get a crown in {{preparation}} for the annual Mountain Spirit festival from the elder which takes him to Haggleton. However he finds out the man that is supposed to make the crown has gone out <b>somewhere</b> <b>to</b> the northwest of town and never came back. The hero then heads in that direction and finds a large hole with the crown maker just barely hanging on. The hero attempts to rescue him and succeeds but in the process, slips and falls to the world below. In this mysterious world, the hero finds a nearby town in which the townspeople cannot see him. The hero grabs a tip from one of the townspeople that there's a special well to the north which people went in never came back; thus the hero heads in that direction and returns to his world.|$|E

5|$|Five {{years into}} Superman's regime, the {{insurgency}} discovers a parallel universe where Joker's plan failed, and they teleport that world's Wonder Woman (Susan Eisenberg), Aquaman (Phil LaMarr), Green Arrow (Alan Tudyk), and Green Lantern (Adam Baldwin) into their universe. Batman and Joker are accidentally transported as well, but are separated after {{an encounter with}} the regime's military forces. While searching for <b>somewhere</b> <b>to</b> recharge his power ring, Green Lantern encounters Sinestro (Troy Baker) and his Yellow Lantern counterpart. Aquaman visits the archives of Atlantis, where he discovers how Superman descended into tyranny and that Atlantis has agreed to complete subjugation under Superman. He is then forced to fight his counterpart as well.|$|E
5|$|The story reveals that, long ago, the Bridge {{had been}} closed to vehicle traffic (for three years) and that the {{pressure}} to find <b>somewhere</b> <b>to</b> live had forced homeless people to seize the bridge {{and set up a}} squatters' town there. The community that arose was vibrant and was watched by the world's media. The town grew in a piecemeal fashion, built from salvaged parts as well as from material apparently donated by more wealthy nations. At {{the end of the story}} Skinner has a dream in which he remembers being at the front of the crowd who seized the bridge (Skinner is the first onto the bridge) and scaled the towers.|$|E
5|$|He {{is always}} there, he knows everything. He is infallible but always failing. When the boys rescue him, he is {{typically}} emaciated, dehydrated, semi-conscious, delirious; they must succor him with candy bars and water. He {{can take on}} any shape, but reveals his identity within moments of doing so. He never discusses a case except the one he's working on in a given novel, so that his legendary close-mouthedness turns to garrulousness when a Hardy Boys novel begins, which is of course {{the only time we}} ever get to see him. All the same, he only discusses the case in enough detail to mislead his sons and put them in mortal danger. He has systems of information and data-gathering that put the FBI to shame, yet he is always losing his case notes, his ciphers, his microfilm, or some other valuable clue, usually by leaving it in his extra pair of pants, meaning that the Boys have to drive to Canada or Florida or <b>somewhere</b> <b>to</b> retrieve it. I suppose he isn't mysterious at all; he simply embodies what many think of their own fathers: utterly powerful, contemptibly inept.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after passing}} the {{accident}} site at Parkside, the train passed {{a group of}} uniformed men walking along the railway carrying a variety of objects. It later transpired {{that this was the}} band, who had left their wagon when it had been commandeered to carry the injured Huskisson. The train which had carried the Duke of Wellington to Roby had not had space for them, and had left them to wait for the other trains which they believed were following. The band had eventually given up waiting and walked home, along a grass verge that was turning to mud under the heavy rain. As the train passed Sutton the three engines were unable to haul the combined weight of the train up an incline, and 400 of the men aboard were obliged {{to get out of the}} train and walk for a mile, illuminated only by the sparks flying from the locomotives, as the engines slowly hauled the empty carriages up the gradient. The train finally arrived in Liverpool at 10.30pm. Many of the guests had planned to return home in daylight following the completion of the journey, and set out into the pitch-black city in search of <b>somewhere</b> <b>to</b> sleep.|$|E
5|$|The Kejache {{occupied}} a territory {{to the north}} of the Itza, between the lakes and what is now Campeche. To the west of them was Acalan, inhabited by a Chontal Maya-speaking group with their capital in the south of what is now Campeche state. The Ch'olan Maya-speaking Lakandon (not to be confused with the modern inhabitants of Chiapas by that name) controlled territory along the tributaries of the Usumacinta River spanning southwestern Petén in Guatemala and eastern Chiapas. The Lakandon had a fierce reputation among the Spanish. The Xocmo were another Ch'olan-speaking group; they occupied the remote forest <b>somewhere</b> <b>to</b> the east of the Lakandon. Never conquered, the Xocmo escaped repeated Spanish attempts to locate them and their eventual fate is unknown; they may be ancestors of the modern Lacandon people. The Manche Ch'ol held territory in the extreme south of what is now the Petén department. The Mopan and the Chinamita had their polities in the southeastern Petén. The Manche territory was to the southwest of the Mopan.|$|E
5|$|The {{flashback}} jumps {{forward to}} April's time at Fairdale Residential School. She befriends Poppy, who has Asperger syndrome. In the present, Marion buys a mobile phone for April. Back at Fairdale, April is being taught by Miss Bean (Marion). A {{piece of work}} on family trees leads to the pair fighting. At night, April tries to escape the school to find Gina, but is caught by Marion, who sends her back. Marion reads April's records, and, having learnt of her history, apologises for the family tree incident. Banned from {{going out on a}} Saturday with her peers, April is instead taken to the stately home by Marion. A present-day Marion goes alone to her house, to find that there are no messages on the phone. The younger Marion introduces April to Elliot as they continue to visit the home. The present-day Marion goes to April's room, and looks in April's box, which contains mementos from different times in her life. The younger April and Marion walk through the home's garden, and Marion tells April she is leaving Fairdale. April becomes angry, thinking that Marion, like others before her, is now going to leave her life. Marion invites April to move in with her, and she accepts. When shown around her new bedroom, April's first concern is to have <b>somewhere</b> <b>to</b> put her box. The present April considers returning to Marion, but realises there is another place she wants to visit. It occurs to Marion where April will be going, and she drives away from her house. April goes to the street where she was found as a baby, and stands among the bins. Marion opens April's mobile and rings Reno's, the pizza parlour. April then notices a phone number {{on the side of a}} dustbin. Marion asks for directions to the pizza parlour, while April dials the number she found. It is not her mother who answers, as she hoped, but Frankie, the pizza boy who found her. She meets Frankie in the pizza parlour, and Marion arrives. April explains who Frankie is, and Marion gives April her new phone. The three sit down together. A voice-over from April says that, though she will probably never know her birth mother, she has a mother in Marion, and this is just the beginning.|$|E

In 2000, the original and current members of Kansas reunited at Livgren's studio to record a new album written entirely by Livgren, titled <b>Somewhere</b> <b>to</b> Elsewhere. Though the album received very favorable reviews, sales were not comparable to Kansas' past successes decades earlier.|$|E
25|$|The date of {{the battle}} is uncertain, with most {{scholars}} accepting a date around 500. The location is also unknown, though locations have been proposed over the years, including southwest England, perhaps {{near the city of}} Bath or the nearby Solsbury Hill, where an ancient hill fort existed, and <b>somewhere</b> <b>to</b> the north, in or near modern Scotland. Some believe Badon Hill was fought between the British and the invading South Saxons under their Bretanwealda Aelle. It is theorised that Aelle may have died in the battle and that Sussex did not again attack the Celts until 571.|$|E
25|$|A Luftwaffe {{aircraft}} {{was shot down}} over Iraq during the advance on Baghdad. The nearest Axis bases were on Rhodes, and so the aircraft had to stage through <b>somewhere</b> <b>to</b> {{be able to get}} to Iraq. The only possible place was Vichy-controlled Syria. This overtly hostile action could not be tolerated. Consequently, after victory in Iraq, British forces invaded Syria and Lebanon to remove the Vichy officials from power there. Vigorous resistance was put up by the French against British and Australian forces moving into Lebanon from Palestine. However, pressure there eventually overwhelmed, and when this combined with an advance on Damascus from Iraq, the French surrendered.|$|E
