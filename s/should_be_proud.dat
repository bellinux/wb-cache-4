25|$|I am {{honestly}} {{against the}} social intermingling of Negroes and Whites but I hold nothing personal against the Negroes as a race. They <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>proud</b> of their God-given heritage just as I {{am proud of}} mine. I believe Negroes {{should have the right}} , and in Mississippi too—when their main purpose is not to put me out of office and when they won't try to besmirch the reputation of my state.|$|E
25|$|Take {{for example}} {{one who is}} invited to dine with his colleagues or clients, would we allow him to avoid embarrassment by eating fruit and {{vegetables}} from which terumot and ma'asrot (which nowadays is Rabbinic) have not been removed, or by consuming hamets she-avar alav haPesah, or by drinking Stam yeynam (wine touched or poured by a non-Jew). Or alternatively, suppose someone is at a meeting and is ashamed to walk out in order to daven Minha. And what about prayers {{at the airport in}} between flights. Would we allow him to forgo his rabbinic prayer obligation because of this embarrassment? The answer is that in those cases where acting according to halakha - be it to not eat terumot and ma’asrot, or to not drink stam yeynam, or to fulfill ones prayer obligation – creates the embarrassment, then kevod ha-beriyyot cannot set aside the Rabbinic prohibition. One <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>proud</b> to be fulfilling the halakha.|$|E

25|$|At the loft, Regina has a {{chat with}} Henry about Emma, and tells him that he <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>proud</b> of his mother for having magic, then heals his ear. Henry mourns {{the fact that he}} is normal and has no special powers, but Regina insists that he {{possesses}} the heart of the truest believer and tells him that he is just as powerful as either one of his mothers, even without magic. Regina then goes downstairs to talk to Mary Margaret and David after overhearing that they believe Emma is doing the right thing in getting rid of her powers. Regina talks them out of it by saying that her powers are part of her and that they are her gift. She insists that she only needs to channel it the right way and use it to protect the town. The two eventually agree with Regina and as they decide to search again for their daughter, they notice that the locator spell and Emma's scarf missing. Then, they also notice that Elsa is gone.|$|E

500|$|Dawkins {{suggests}} that atheists <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>proud,</b> not apologetic, stressing that atheism {{is evidence of}} a healthy, independent mind. He hopes that the more atheists identify themselves, the more the public will become aware of just {{how many people are}} nonbelievers, thereby reducing the negative opinion of atheism among the religious majority. [...] Inspired by the gay rights movement, he endorsed the Out Campaign to encourage atheists worldwide to declare their stance publicly. He supported the UK's first atheist advertising initiative, the Atheist Bus Campaign in 2008, which aimed to raise funds to place atheist advertisements on buses in the London area.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to The North Stands for Nothing {{was generally}} positive. Several reviewers noted {{on the balance}} that While She Sleeps have between melody and the heavier elements of their sound. Metal Hammer reviewer Terry Bezer, specifically complimented the track [...] "Hearts Aside Our Horses"– enthusing that it is [...] "a lesson in how to be both progressive and hook laden at once." [...] Adam Kennedy of Kerrang! complimented the band for putting [...] "their own spin" [...] on metalcore. Saying that they test and respect the genre's conventions in equal measure– specifically noting their use of a piano interlude on [...] "Trophies" [...] while suggesting that [...] "tearing heads off is their forte". In his review for Big Cheese, Lais Martin Wairing enthused that the band are [...] "very promising," [...] comparing them to Bring Me the Horizon but offering that While She Sleeps [...] "deserve success in their own right." [...] The album also received some minor criticism, with several reviewers picking up on the short overall length of the CD and While She Sleeps' similarities to other bands.

500|$|IGN's Craig Harris {{awarded the}} game an Editor's Choice award, stating, [...] "This is an {{incredibly}} challenging, old-school throwback that might not set the genre afire with innovation, but in my book, it's better than the awesome game that inspired it. [...] Rare <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>proud</b> that its design is in the right hands. Or just insanely jealous. Either works." [...] Video game talk show Good Games two presenters gave the game a 9 and 8.5 out of 10, praising how true the music kept to {{the style of the}} original tracks, and that it managed to keep from becoming too complex while still avoiding being over-simplified, saying [...] "If you're a fan of the old Donkeys, or you just want a great platforming experience, this is worth {{at least as much as}} Kong's golden banana hoard." [...] X-Play praised the similarity of Returns to previous games in the series, the game's replay value, and its graphics, but the review criticized the motion controls [...] "that force you to react quickly at bad times, a button press would suffice" [...] and the co-op game play, saying, [...] "If your partner has a penchant for dying, look forward to some short games as he or she will most likely drain the number of lives you both share." [...] GamesRadar complimented the title for its standout levels and fan service, while criticizing it for levels that are [...] "frustrating, unclear and often misleading way that is unlike any prior Donkey Kong adventure", and motion controls that make them [...] "question the controls in a platformer". GameTrailers praised the game's gameplay and the diversity of the levels, while Giant Bomb claimed, [...] "Retro recaptures most of Donkey Kong's venerated platforming roots in this fine Wii sequel." ...|$|E
500|$|In Utero {{received}} acclaim from critics, {{although some}} reviews were mixed. Times Christopher John Farley stated {{in his review}} of the album, [...] "Despite the fears of some alternative-music fans, Nirvana hasn't gone mainstream, though this potent new album may once again force the mainstream to go Nirvana." [...] Rolling Stone reviewer David Fricke said that the album is [...] "a lot of things – brilliant, corrosive, enraged and thoughtful, most of them all at once. But more than anything, it's a triumph of the will." [...] Entertainment Weekly reviewer David Browne commented [...] "Kurt Cobain hates it all", and noted that the sentiment pervades the record. Browne argued, [...] "The music is often mesmerizing, cathartic rock & roll, but it is rock & roll without release, because the band is suspicious of the old-school rock cliches such a release would evoke." [...] NME magazine's John Mulvey had doubts about the record; he concluded, [...] "As a document of a mind in flux – dithering, dissatisfied, unable {{to come to terms}} with sanity – Kurt [...] <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>proud</b> of [...] As a follow-up to one of the best records of the past ten years it just isn't quite there." [...] Ben Thompson of The Independent commented that in spite of the album's more abrasive songs, [...] "In Utero is beautiful far more often than it is ugly", and added, [...] "Nirvana have wisely neglected to make the unlistenable punk-rock nightmare they threatened us with." [...] Q magazine felt that the album showcases Cobain's songwriting abilities and wrote, [...] "If this is how Cobain is going to develop, the future is lighthouse-bright". Several critics ranked In Utero as one of the best releases of the year. It placed first and second in the album categories of the Rolling Stone and Village Voice Pazz & Jop year-end critics' polls, respectively. Additionally, The New York Times included it on its list of the top ten albums of the year. The album was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album at the 1994 Grammy Awards.|$|E
