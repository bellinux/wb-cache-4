5|$|Huge {{flocks of}} more than a million common {{starlings}} may be observed just before sunset in spring in southwestern Jutland, Denmark over the seaward marshlands of Tønder and Esbjerg municipalities between Tønder and Ribe. They gather in March until northern Scandinavian birds leave for their breeding ranges by mid-April. Their swarm behaviour creates complex shapes <b>silhouetted</b> <b>against</b> the sky, a phenomenon known locally as sort sol ("black sun").|$|E
5|$|The radar {{contacts}} were, in fact, {{the approaching}} 31 Japanese torpedo bombers, who circled {{around to the}} south of TF18 so that they could attack from the east, with the black backdrop of the eastern sky behind them. From this direction, the Japanese bombers were hidden by the night sky, but Giffen's ships were <b>silhouetted</b> <b>against</b> the twilight of the western horizon. The 705AG aircraft attacked first, beginning at 19:19. Nakamura's aircraft missed with all of their torpedoes and one was shot down by anti-aircraft fire from Giffen's ships.|$|E
5|$|At {{about the}} same time, Winnie Johnson sent Hindley another letter, again {{pleading}} with her to assist the police in finding the body of her son Keith. In the letter, Johnson was sympathetic to Hindley over the criticism surrounding her first visit. Hindley, who had not replied to the first letter, responded by thanking Johnson for both letters, explaining that her decision not to reply to the first resulted from the negative publicity that surrounded it. She claimed that, had Johnson written to her 14years earlier, she would have confessed and helped the police. She also paid tribute to Topping, and thanked Johnson for her sincerity. Hindley made her second visit to the moor in March 1987. This time, the level of security surrounding her visit was considerably higher. She stayed overnight in Manchester, at the flat of the police chief in charge of GMP training at Sedgley Park, Prestwich, and visited the moor twice. She confirmed to police that the two areas {{in which they were}} concentrating their search—Hollin Brown Knoll and Hoe Grain—were correct, although she was unable to locate either of the graves. She later remembered that as Pauline Reade was being buried she had been sitting next to her on a patch of grass and could see the rocks of Hollin Brown Knoll <b>silhouetted</b> <b>against</b> the night sky.|$|E

5|$|The Sounds changed {{affiliates}} in 2005, {{welcoming the}} Milwaukee Brewers as their sixth different major league franchise. Coincidentally, the major/minor league sports connection between Nashville and Milwaukee was duplicated from 2005 to 2014, but with reverse roles, in ice hockey, as the Milwaukee Admirals were the top-level minor league affiliate of the National Hockey League's Nashville Predators. The Sounds also debuted a new oval-shaped logo {{with a baseball}} player <b>silhouetted</b> <b>against</b> a yellow background hitting a ball toward the Nashville skyline with the city's name written above within a red border and the team name written in red and black script below. The new Brewers affiliate was managed by Frank Kremblas and featured top prospects such as Rickie Weeks, Prince Fielder, Nelson Cruz, and Corey Hart. The affiliation started well as the club won the American Conference Northern Division title on the second-to-last {{day of the season}} with a 75–69 record. The team {{went on to win the}} American Conference title against the Oklahoma RedHawks, three games to two, before sweeping the Tacoma Rainiers in three straight games in the finals to win the 2005 Pacific Coast League championship. Outfielder Nelson Cruz clinched the title with a three-run home run with two outs in the 13th inning. This was Nashville's first title since their previous league crown in 1982 and their first championship as a Triple-A team.|$|E
5|$|A film studio set {{was created}} by photographing several reel spools with strips of film {{dangling}} {{against a background of}} blinking lights. The casting office {{was created by}} silhouetting strips of cardboard against a white background. To portray the mental anguish of the protagonist, strips of paper were cut into the shape of twisted trees, which were <b>silhouetted</b> <b>against</b> a background of moving shadows and set in motion with an electric fan. To create a scene {{near the end of the}} film, when the protagonist starts becoming delirious, the camera moves through a maze of different sized cubes, with geometric designs inside them, all placed on a flat, shiny service. The heaven setting was also a miniature set created from paper cubes, tin cans, cigar boxes, toy trains, and a motorized Erector Set. No still photos were taken for the film, but illustrations showing prism and kaleidoscope effects have been made by enlarging frames of negative. The paper prints were considerably softer than the movie print in order to avoid graininess. The final film was edited to a one-reel length of 1,200 feet of film strip, featuring about 150 scenes. Florey said it featured the same number of angles as full-length feature films of the time. Although the film was carefully edited to be synchronized with Rhapsody in Blue, much of the original lyrical quality has been lost in shortened and modified versions of the film.|$|E

25|$|The Swift's initial {{position}} was below, behind, {{and to the}} right of the DC-6, so the Swift's pilot should have easily been able to see the large DC-6 overhead and to his left. From the viewpoint of the DC-6 flight crew, the Swift may have been in a blind spot created by the DC-6 nose structure; if not, the small silver-grey plane would be hard to see <b>silhouetted</b> <b>against</b> the ground.|$|E
25|$|Mesopelagic {{fish are}} adapted for an active life under low light conditions. Most {{of them are}} visual predators with large eyes. Some of the deeper water fish have tubular eyes with big lenses and only rod cells that look upwards. These give {{binocular}} vision and great sensitivity to small light signals. This adaptation gives improved terminal vision {{at the expense of}} lateral vision, and allows the predator to pick out squid, cuttlefish, and smaller fish that are <b>silhouetted</b> <b>against</b> the gloom above them.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not unusual}} in Somers to see some (introduced) koalas and the suburb {{is well known for}} its Koala Walk. The {{distinctive}} growl of Koalas can often be heard in the town. Travellers are advised to take care, as koalas frequently cross local roads, and show little road sense. Occasionally echidnas have been seen in the area around The Promenade. Bushy-tail and ring- tail Possums are commonplace, and can often be seen soon after nightfall, scurrying along powerlines and thus <b>silhouetted</b> <b>against</b> the night sky.|$|E

25|$|The {{painting}} {{depicts a}} jack pine as a decorative and abstracted pattern, its shapes boldly simplified against the sunset. This stylization demonstrates Thomson's command of decorative effects, developed {{during his years}} as a graphic designer, and with the strong colour and value contrasts, creates the picture's symbolic resonance. The pine, its branches bowed and placed to the right of centre, extends nearly the full length of the canvas, and is cropped at the top. It rises from a rocky foreground; the hardy jack pine often takes root on shores hostile to other trees, its sparsely leaved branches forming eccentric shapes. It is <b>silhouetted</b> <b>against</b> water and sky, with the canvas bisected by the far shore.|$|E
25|$|O'Keeffe {{traveled}} to New Mexico by 1929 {{with her friend}} Rebecca Strand and stayed in Taos {{at the home of}} Mabel Dodge Luhan, who provided the women with studios. O'Keeffe went on many pack trips, exploring the rugged mountains and deserts of the region that summer and later visited the nearby D. H. Lawrence Ranch, where she completed her now famous oil painting, The Lawrence Tree, currently owned by the Wadsworth Athenaeum in Hartford, Connecticut. O'Keeffe visited and painted the nearby historical San Francisco de Asis Mission Church at Ranchos de Taos. She made several paintings of the church, as had many artists, and her painting of a fragment of it <b>silhouetted</b> <b>against</b> the sky captured it from a unique perspective.|$|E
25|$|The new tactic {{outlined}} in Herrmann's report envisaged {{the use of}} free-ranging day fighters (and {{to a lesser extent}} night fighters) to counter Bomber Command. The single-engined fighters were to supplement the ground controlled Himmelbett (four-poster bed) technique, by co-operation with searchlight crews, mostly over the target. Pyrotechnic and other visual means were to guide the fighters in operations known as Wilde Sau (Wild Boar). After the fighters had reached the combat zone, pilots tried to identify and intercept enemy bombers visually; searchlights were to be used to illuminate the sky. Initial tests using former flying instructors experienced in blind-flying techniques, suggested the ideal weather conditions were when a certain (not too thick) lower level cloud cover prevailed, since then the bomber would be <b>silhouetted</b> <b>against</b> the back-lit clouds and the high-flying German fighters could easily spot their targets.|$|E

500|$|Caspar David Friedrich (5 September 1774 – 7 May 1840) was a 19th-century German Romantic {{landscape}} painter, {{generally considered}} the most important German artist of his generation. He {{is best known for}} his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures <b>silhouetted</b> <b>against</b> night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs [...] "the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension".|$|E
500|$|Cinematographer James Wong Howe shot Hud in {{black-and-white}} to [...] "elevate its dramatic propensities". Filmed in Panavision, Howe used {{high contrast}} with unbalanced {{light and dark}} tones. He highlighted the white ground and clear skies, making the shadows black. Dark tones were [...] "overpowered" [...] by light ones, creating a sense of [...] "infinite space". For faces and structures, Howe used light reflected from the ground. The contrast between the environment and objects <b>silhouetted</b> <b>against</b> the background provides a sense of depth. Ritt's biographer, Carlton Jackson, wrote that in Hud [...] "the scenery becomes {{a part of the}} thematic development itself". According to Texas Monthly, [...] "Howe's austere rendition of Texas landscapes remains one of the film's most distinctive pleasures".|$|E

500|$|... "Zoo Station" [...] {{made its}} live debut {{on the opening}} night of the Zoo TV Tour on 29 February 1992 in Lakeland, Florida, and was {{performed}} as the opening song {{at each of the}} 156 Zoo TV concerts. During performances of [...] "Zoo Station", Bono appeared on-stage <b>silhouetted</b> <b>against</b> a giant screen of blue and white video noise, making his entrance as his leather-clad stage persona [...] "The Fly", often goose-stepping his way onto the stage. The Edge described the visual imagery displayed for the song in the context of Zoo TV's [...] "sensory overload" [...] that was intended as a commentary on mass media: [...] "'Zoo Station' is four minutes of a television that's not tuned in to any station, but giving you interference and 'shash' and almost a TV picture." ...|$|E
500|$|Traditionally the Upper Ward {{was judged}} to be [...] "to all intents and {{purposes}} a nineteenth-century creation... the image of what the early nineteenth-century thought a castle should be", {{as a result of the}} extensive redesign of the castle by Wyatville under George IV. The walls of the Upper Ward are built of Bagshot Heath stone faced on the inside with regular bricks, the gothic details in yellow Bath stone. The buildings in the Upper Ward are characterised by the use of small bits of flint in the mortar for galletting, originally started at the castle in the 17th century to give stonework from disparate periods a similar appearance. The skyline of the Upper Ward is designed to be dramatic when seen from a distance or <b>silhouetted</b> <b>against</b> the horizon, an image of tall towers and battlements influenced by the picturesque movement of the late 18th century. Archaeological and restoration work following the 1992 fire has shown the extent to which the current structure represents a survival of elements from the original 12th-century stone walls onwards, presented within the context of Wyatville's final remodelling.|$|E
500|$|The concert {{began with}} a fixed {{sequence}} of six to eight consecutive Achtung Baby songs, a further sign that {{they were no longer}} the U2 of the 1980s. For the opening song, [...] "Zoo Station", Bono entered as his primary stage persona, [...] "The Fly", appearing <b>silhouetted</b> <b>against</b> a giant screen of blue and white video noise interwoven with glimpses of xerox animations of the band members. [...] "The Fly" [...] was usually performed next, with the video monitors flashing a rapidly changing array of textual words and aphorisms. Some of these included [...] "Taste is the enemy of art", [...] "Religion is a club", [...] "Ignorance is bliss", [...] "Watch more TV", [...] "Believe" [...] with letters fading out to leave [...] "lie", and [...] "Everything you know is wrong". (During {{the first week of the}} tour, media outlets incorrectly reported that the words shown included [...] "Bomb Japan Now", forcing the band to issue a statement denying the claim.) Before [...] "Even Better Than the Real Thing", Bono channel surfed through live television programming, and during the song, as random images from television and pop culture flashed on screen, he filmed himself and the band with a camcorder.|$|E
