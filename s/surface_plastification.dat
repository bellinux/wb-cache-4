40|$|For the {{production}} of small quantities of micro devices, machining is a low cost alternative to lithographic processing techniques. However, machining shows process specific size-effects upon miniaturization to the micrometer regime. Hence, the orthogonal turning process is chosen to study the influence of process parameters like uncut chip thickness h, cutting velocity v and cutting edge radius on the cutting force and the <b>surface</b> <b>plastification</b> by two-dimensional, thermo-mechanically coupled finite element simulations. A rate-dependent plasticity law is used for investigation of a normalized medium carbon steel (AISI 1045). Furthermore, {{the characteristics of the}} influences of the different parameters are analyzed mathematically by similarity mechanics. In particular, the frictional effects on the cutting process are studied in detail using a friction coefficient based on experimental results, and the influences of the process parameters on the cutting force and the plastic deformation of the surface layer are determined numerically. These results are compared with experimental measurements. The specific cutting forces are analyzed and discussed in detail. Size-effects observed experimentally are also found by numerical simulations...|$|E
