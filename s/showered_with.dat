5|$|SpongeBob {{receives}} a paddle ball {{sent to him}} in the mail and decides to play it. He is totally consumed by the challenge and forgets Gary for ten days. Gary feels neglected and runs away from home. SpongeBob is shaken from his infatuation with the arrival of Patrick, and cannot find Gary. SpongeBob finds a note saying that Gary has left in search of a new owner. Meanwhile, Gary has wandered into a new city, encountering a gang of snails. A kind old lady discovers Gary and mistakes him for one of her pets, Miss Tuftsy. Gary is <b>showered</b> <b>with</b> love and food while SpongeBob goes to work, sad that Gary is still missing. Mr. Krabs encourages SpongeBob to work, but SpongeBob misinterprets him, and he takes the day off to look for Gary. He and Patrick put up posters and signs everywhere in the hope of finding Gary.|$|E

5|$|A host treated his {{retainers}} {{very well}} and showered them with luxury gifts {{if he wanted to}} boast his wealth and status. One retainer even received a sword scabbard decorated with jade and pearls, while others were given items like shoes decorated with pearls. However, not all retainers shared the same status, as those <b>showered</b> <b>with</b> gifts often provided highly skilled work or greater services; retainers who were not as skilled were given lesser gifts and seated in less honorable positions when meeting the host. Regardless of status, any retainer was allowed to come and go from his host's residence as he or she pleased, unlike a slave who was the property of his master and permanently attached to the estate. There was no official government policy {{on how to deal with}} retainers, but when they broke laws they were arrested, and when their master broke the law, sometimes the retainers were detained alongside him.|$|E

40|$|Title: Cosmic Ray <b>Showers</b> <b>with</b> Anomalous Longitudinal Profile Author: Jiří Blažek Department: Institute of Particle and Nuclear Physics, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University Supervisor: RNDr. Petr Trávníček, Ph. D., Institute of Physics ASCR Abstract: The aim of {{this work}} was to study high-energy cosmic ray <b>showers</b> <b>with</b> {{anomalous}} longitudinal profiles generated by Monte-Carlo simulation and subse- quently use the acquired analysis techniques on results from the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) in Argentina. Firstly, a short introduction of various de- scriptions of the extensive air showers was given. Then a systematic analysis was performed on approx. 7 × 105 simulated <b>showers</b> <b>with</b> three different tech- niques. A brief explanation of the functionality of the PAO was given, then the importance of monitoring the immediate state of the atmosphere using the Shoot- the-Shower program was elucidated and the FRAM telescope was described in detail. FRAM enabled an identification of <b>showers</b> <b>with</b> a clear atmospheric back- ground, this sample of showers was then analyzed and several interesting events warranting a further study were chosen.
