25|$|Similar to Improv, {{formulas}} can {{be represented}} as icons in Numbers, allowing them to be dragged about the sheets. One noteworthy {{example of this is}} a <b>sidebar</b> which contains the sum, average and other basic calculations for the current selection in the active table. These serve a function similar to the sum that appears {{at the bottom of the}} window in Excel. However, the user can drag one of the function icons from the <b>sidebar</b> into the sheet to make the calculation appear in that location. In another nod to Improv, the Formula List shows all of the formulas in the spreadsheet in a separate area, and allows edits in place or easy navigation to their use in the sheets.|$|E

The background properties of this division provides {{the background of the}} center column, and the left and right borders, which are given widths equal to the side column widths, provide the background colors of the <b>sidebars.</b> The content of each column is positioned over its background. This method still uses one non-semantic division, and makes it difficult to apply background images and borders to the <b>sidebars.</b>|$|R

25|$|Truncation {{errors are}} {{committed}} when an iterative method is terminated or a mathematical procedure is approximated, and the approximate solution {{differs from the}} exact solution. Similarly, discretization induces a discretization error because {{the solution of the}} discrete problem does not coincide with the solution of the continuous problem. For instance, in the iteration in the <b>sidebar</b> to compute the solution of , after 10 or so iterations, we conclude that the root is roughly 1.99 (for example). We therefore have a truncation error of 0.01.|$|E
