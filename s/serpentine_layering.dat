40|$|We {{describe}} {{the shape and}} internal structure of polyhedral spheroids found in serpentinized peridotites which correspond to a new serpentine microstructure. Serpentine spheroids resemble geodesic domes made of c. 160 to 180 triangular facets. At facet edges, the nested layers bend by c. 14 ° along their three crystallographic directions, resulting in an onion-like structure with lateral continuity of the layers. The stacking of the <b>serpentine</b> <b>layers</b> within sectors is controlled by interlayer bonding. These polyhedral onions are made of a novel type of spherical nanostructure for layered materials...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{backward}} crosstalk {{among the}} sections of a serpentine delay line accumulates to appear as a laddering wave in the receiving waveform. This occurrence results in severe signal distortion and timing skew of the clock signal. The layout of double <b>layer</b> <b>serpentine</b> delay line can reduced crosstalk between lines. The waveform of double <b>layer</b> <b>serpentine</b> delay line has been investigated with simulation approach. The results obtained by the SPICE simulation shown that the laddering waves in double <b>layer</b> <b>serpentine</b> were retarded. Although a laddering wave still exist but the penalty of the delay time incurred by the crosstalk is depressed...|$|R
40|$|A monolithic, CMOS, constant-fraction {{discriminator}} (CFD) was fabricated in the Orbit Semiconductor, 1. 2 {mu} N-well process. This circuit uses an on-chip, distributed, R-C delay-line {{to realize}} the constant-fraction shaping. The delay-line is constructed from a narrow, 500 -{mu} <b>serpentine</b> <b>layer</b> of polysilicon above a wide, grounded, second layer of polysilicon. This R-C delay-line generates about 1. 1 ns of delay for 5 ns risetime signals with a slope degradation of only {approx_equal} 15 % and an amplitude reduction of about 6. 1 %. The CFD also features an automatic walk adjustment. The entire circuit, including the delay line, has a 200 {mu} pitch and is 950 {mu} long. The walk for a 5 ns risetime signal was measured as {plus_minus} 100 ps over the 100 : 1 dynamic range from {minus} 15 mV to {minus} 1. 5 mV. to {minus} 1. 5 V. The CFD consumes 15 mW...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] X-ray {{diffraction}} {{studies of}} the pore-lining chloritic mineral from the Tuscaloosa Formation disclose a marked pattern of odd-order line broadening for the 001 to the 00, 16 reflections. The odd-order peaks are approximately twice as broad as the even orders after correction for instrumental broad-ening effects. These {{results are consistent with}} a randomly interstratified 7 -A/ 14 -A. structure, which is most likely serpentine/chlorite. Quantitative analysis of line broadening and model calculations indicate that the serpentine/chlorite contains 7 % <b>serpentine</b> <b>layers.</b> A simplified method is proposed for quantifying randomly interstratified serpentine/chlorite. Residual line broadening (fir) is obtained from the half-height widths of uncorrected diffraction profiles for the 004 and 005 "chlorite " reflections by means of the following: 1 ~r = (~o~o ~ 5 - ~ lo~ 5) z~. Percent serpentine in the random interstratification is computed from the empirical expression %S =- 0. 51 + 24. 27 ~r, which is valid from about 1 to 20 percent serpentine...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} the physical bases of earthquake generation along subducting plate boundaries, {{it is important}} to know the physical properties of rocks, asperity distribution, and presence of water at the plate interface. Two seismic experiments in the Japan Trench and the Izu-Bonin Trench revealed a strong correlation for aseismic zone and intense seismic reflections, and the possibility of a low-temperature phase of serpentine at subducting plate boundaries. <b>Serpentine</b> <b>layer</b> or high water contents in the layer may cause intense seismic reflections. Free water and/or low- temperature serpentine mineral may act as a lubricant at the subducting plate boundary, and large earthquakes may be controlled by the presence of these materials. We propose three types of subduction zone around the Japan arc and the Izu-Bonin arc to characterize earthquake generation in each subduction zone. Earthquake occurrence in three typical subduction zones may be controlled by differences in the free water contents of rocks and hydrous minerals along subduction boundaries. Dehydration of hydrous phases brings other conditions related to earthquake generation...|$|R

40|$|AB ST RACT: X-ray {{diffraction}} (XRD) patterns ofa pore-lining diagenetic chlorite (14 /~) from {{a reservoir}} sandstone, offshore Norway, show broad odd-order and sharp even-order basal reflections indicating that it contains 7 A layers. Using NEWMOD, simulated XRD patterns with 15 % 7 A <b>serpentine</b> <b>layers</b> {{and a maximum}} crystallite hickness of 30 layers match the natural mineral well. Microprobe analyses ofthe 7 A- 14 • mineral indicate hat it is Fe-rich and aluminous suggesting that it is interstratified berthierine-chamosite. Apparent octahedral vacancies, however, suggest a significant dioctahedral component, and an alternative interpretation is interstratified kaolinite-chlorite. Indeed, chemical nalyses ofthe mineral suggest a mixture of chlorite with 15 % kaolinite, precisely the proportion of 7 ~ layers indicated by XRD. Two other examples from the literature, previously identified as diagenetic chlorite, are probably also 7 A- 14 A interstratified minerals, {{and the proportion of}} 7 ~ layers indicated by XRD is also correlated with their structural formulae, if the 7 A layers are, in fact, kaolinitic. This type of interstratification c uld explain why Fe-rich diagenetic chlorites appear to be compositionally distinct from metamorphic chlorites. The structure and chemistry ofthe Norwegian chlorite tend to support the idea that pore-lining chlorites form early in the diagenetic history, inhibiting the precipitation f later diagenetic minerals, and hence preservin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Oxygen isotopic {{compositions}} {{were determined}} for coexisting mixed-layer serpentine-chlorite (Sp-Ch) and illite-smectite (I-S) from 5 Tuscaloosa Formation sandstone cores sampled between 1937 and 5470 m burial depth. High gradient magnetic separation (HGMS) {{was used to}} concentrate Sp-Ch and I-S from the < 0. 5 p~m fraction of each core sample into fractions with a range in the Sp-Ch: I-S ratio, and end-member ~ 80 compositions were determined by extrapolation. The Sp-Ch ~ 180 values range from + 10. 4 to 13. 7 %o and increase with burial between 3509 and 5470 m. The only exception is Sp-Ch from 1937 m, which has an anomalously high 8180 value of + 12. 6 %o. The I-S ~tsO values range from + 16. 1 to 17. 3 %o and do not change significantly between 3509 and 5470 m burial depth. Pore water ~ 80 compositions calculated from Sp-Ch and I-S values and measured borehole tempera-tures range from- 2. 6 to + 10. 3 %o. The isotopically light values indicate that Sp-Ch formed at shallow burial depths {{in the presence of}} brackish to marine water and/or meteoric water. The depth-related increase in 8180 of Sp-Ch is attributed to oxygen exchange between mineral and pore water during diagenetic mineral reactions. Increasing 8 ~ 80 values, in conjunction with XRD and SEM data, indicate that trans-formation of <b>serpentine</b> <b>layers</b> to chlorite layers and lbb polytype layers to laa polytype layers occurred on a layer-by-layer basis when individual ayers dissolved and recrystallized within the confines of co...|$|R

Ion-thinned sections of the Murchison meteorite were observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Images obtained of patterns of fringe spacings of 4. 9 and 7. 3 A are interpreted as resulting from ordered and disordered sequences of brucite-like and serpentine-like layers, respectively.

It is suggested that a dominant matrix variety (10 A PCP) has a structure equivalent to iron-rich tochinilite (6 Fe 0. 9 S 5 /Fe, Mg//OHO 2 /), which consists of coherently intrastratified mackinawite and brucite sheets. In addition, it is proposed that 17 A PCP is a commensurate intergrowth of <b>serpentine</b> and tochinilite <b>layers.</b> Various forms of PCP observed in carbonaceous chondrites appear to be intergrowths of tochinilite, serpentine, and tochinilite-serpentine minerals...|$|R

The rate of recrystallization to forsterite is shown to have an inverse relationship to the rate of dehydration. This result is interpreted {{in terms of the}} damage inflicted on the crystal structure of serpentine by the dehydration reaction; the more slowly this reaction occurs, the more readily is forsterite formed {{as a result of the}} topotactic relationship between forsterite and <b>serpentine.</b> The surface <b>layers</b> of particles and massive samples of serpentine which dehydrate readily appear to be highly disordered and consequently recrystallize to forsterite very slowly.

The main objective {{of the present study}} is the determination of critical shock pressures for partial and complete dehydration of serpentine under shock loading. It is pointed out that <b>serpentine</b> and serpentine-like <b>layer</b> silicates are the major water-bearing phases in carbonaceous chondrites. It appears that these minerals, and a poorly defined cometary contribution, were the most likely water-bearing phases in accreting planetesimals which {{led to the formation of}} the terrestrial planets.

Investigation by transmission electron microscopy of exsolved enstatite and augite reveals a multistage hydration process. The first stage (highest T, probably in the amphibole stability field) leads to the formation of biopyribole lamellae within exsolved augite, leaving the enstatite matrix unaffected. The second stage (500 ÿ 300 ëC) corresponds to the topotactic replacement of enstatite by layer silicates (talc + chlorite + <b>serpentine,</b> with (001) <b>layer</b> silicates parallel to (100) enstatite). Enstatite is also replaced by randomly oriented, poorly crystalline serpentine. The last hydration stage (< 300 ëC) corresponds to the disappearence of augite and recrystallization of serpentine, leading to completely hydrated bastites with random lizardite lamellae, polygonal serpentine and minor chrysotile...|$|R
