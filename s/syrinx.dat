5|$|Bird {{calls and}} songs, which are {{produced}} in the <b>syrinx,</b> are the major means by which birds communicate with sound. This communication can be very complex; some species can operate {{the two sides of}} the <b>syrinx</b> independently, allowing the simultaneous production of two different songs.|$|E
5|$|From the Greek {{word for}} pan pipes, σύριγξ, {{it is the}} vocal organ of birds. Located {{at the base of}} a bird's trachea, it {{produces}} sounds without the vocal folds of mammals. The sound is produced by vibrations of some or all of the membrana tympaniformis (the walls of the <b>syrinx)</b> and the pessulus, caused by air flowing through the <b>syrinx.</b> This sets up a self-oscillating system that modulates the airflow creating the sound. The muscles modulate the sound shape by changing the tension of the membranes and the bronchial openings. The <b>syrinx</b> enables some species of birds (such as parrots, crows, and mynas) to mimic human speech. Unlike the larynx of mammals, the <b>syrinx</b> is located where the trachea forks into the lungs. Thus, lateralization of bird song is possible and some songbirds can produce more than one sound at a time.|$|E
5|$|The front toes {{are long}} with small webs at their bases {{and are not}} adapted to grasping. The opening of the nostril is longitudinal, and the {{nostrils}} lack a septum. Like all New World vultures, the lesser yellow-headed vulture lacks a <b>syrinx,</b> and is therefore unable to make any sound other than a low hiss.|$|E
5000|$|Although it is {{sometimes}} reported that storks lack <b>syrinxes</b> and are mute, they do have <b>syrinxes,</b> and are capable of making some sounds, although they do not do so often. [...] The <b>syrinxes</b> of the storks are [...] "variably degenerate" [...] however, and the syringeal membranes of some species are found between tracheal rings or cartilage, an unusual arrangement shared with the ovenbirds.|$|R

5|$|The river martins are in {{some ways}} {{intermediate}} between typical swallows and other passerines: they have stout bills, large feet and relatively strong legs, which is unusual in aerial feeders. They also have a large <b>syrinx</b> (vocal organ) and a different bronchial structure. The extent of their differences from other swallows and the wide geographical separation of these two martins suggest that they are relict populations {{of a group of}} species that diverged from the main swallow lineage early in its evolutionary history, and they may be the most primitive of the swallows. Like other early hirundine lineages, they nest in burrows, rather than adopted nest holes or mud nests.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{have one}} of the most complex {{respiratory}} systems of all animal groups. Upon inhalation, 75% of the fresh air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air. The other 25% of the air goes directly into the lungs. When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the lungs and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs. Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and exhalation. Sound production is achieved using the <b>syrinx,</b> a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from {{the lower end of the}} trachea; the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalisations and the perception of the bird's size.|$|E

40|$|Post-traumatic syringomyelia was {{previously}} {{thought to be}} an infrequent but serious sequel to spinal cord injury.

The acute and chronic pathological changes after trauma are described. Post-traumatic syringomyelia seems to develop from cores of necrotic tissue (myelomalacic cores) rather than lysis of haematoma.

5|$|In Greece, Rome, and Etruria, {{the use and}} {{development}} of musical instruments stood {{in stark contrast to}} those cultures' achievements in architecture and sculpture. The instruments of the time were simple and virtually all of them were imported from other cultures. Lyres were the principal instrument, as musicians used them to honor the gods. Greeks played a variety of wind instruments they classified as aulos (reeds) or <b>syrinx</b> (flutes); Greek writing from that time reflects a serious study of reed production and playing technique. Romans played reed instruments named tibia, featuring side-holes that could be opened or closed, allowing for greater flexibility in playing modes. Other instruments in common use in the region included vertical harps derived from those of the Orient, lutes of Egyptian design, various pipes and organs, and clappers, which were played primarily by women.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{birds are}} known to {{communicate}} using visual and auditory signals, and the wide diversity of visual display structures among fossil dinosaur groups, such as horns, frills, crests, sails and feathers, suggests that visual communication has always been important in dinosaur biology. Reconstruction of the plumage color of Anchiornis huxleyi, suggest the importance of color in visual communication in non-avian dinosaurs. The evolution of dinosaur vocalization is less certain. Paleontologist Phil Senter suggests that non-avian dinosaurs relied mostly on visual displays and possibly non-vocal acoustic sounds like hissing, jaw grinding or clapping, splashing and wing beating (possible in winged maniraptoran dinosaurs). He states they were unlikely to have been capable of vocalizing since their closest relatives, crocodilians and birds, use different means to vocalize, the former via the larynx and the latter through the unique <b>syrinx,</b> suggesting they evolved independently and their common ancestor was mute.|$|E
5|$|Thamnophilidae {{was removed}} from Formicariidae, leaving behind the antthrushes and antpittas, due to {{recognition}} of differences {{in the structure of}} the breastbone (sternum) and <b>syrinx,</b> and Sibley and Ahlquist's examination of DNA–DNA hybridization. The Thamnophilidae antbirds are members of the infraorder Tyrannides (or tracheophone suboscines), one of two infraorders in the suborder Tyranni. The Thamnophilidae are now thought to occupy a fairly basal position within the infraorder, i. e. with regard to their relatives the antthrushes and antpittas, tapaculos, gnateaters, and also the ovenbirds. The sister group of the Thamnophilidae is thought to be the gnateaters. The ovenbirds, tapaculos, antthrushes and antpittas are thought to represent a different radiation of that early split.|$|E
5000|$|Generally, {{there are}} two forms of syringomyelia: {{congenital}} and acquired. (In addition, one form of the disorder involves the brainstem.

5|$|The California condor has a {{long life}} span, {{reaching}} up to 60 years. If it survives to adulthood, the condor has few natural threats other than humans. Because they lack a <b>syrinx,</b> their vocal display is limited to grunts and hisses. Condors bathe frequently and can spend hours a day preening their feathers. Condors also perform urohidrosis, or defecate on their legs, to reduce their body temperature. There is a well-developed social structure within large groups of condors, with competition to determine a pecking order decided by body language, competitive play behavior, {{and a variety of}} hisses and grunts. This social hierarchy is displayed especially when the birds feed, with the dominant birds eating before the younger ones.|$|E
5|$|The {{strain of}} dual careers and {{constant}} separation {{from his wife}} led to an extended breach in his marriage. The couple began separation proceedings in 1916, and separation by mutual consent was granted in 1919. In the period 1916–22, Nielsen often lived on Funen retreating to the Damgaard and Fuglsang estates, or worked as a conductor in Gothenburg. The period was one of creative crisis for Nielsen which, coinciding with World War I, would strongly influence his Fourth (1914–16) and Fifth symphonies (1921–22), arguably his greatest works according to Fanning. The composer was particularly upset in the 1920s when his long-standing Danish publisher Wilhelm Hansen was unable to undertake publication {{of many of his}} major works, including Aladdin and Pan and <b>Syrinx.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{remains of}} a <b>syrinx,</b> which has enough mineral content for fossilization, {{was found in a}} specimen of the duck-like Vegavis iaai dated 69-66 million year ago, and this organ is unlikely to have existed in non-avian dinosaurs. However, in contrast to Senter, the researchers have suggested that dinosaurs could vocalize and that the syrinx-based vocal system of birds evolved from a larynx-based one, rather than the two systems evolving independently. A 2016 study suggests that dinosaurs produced closed mouth vocalizations like cooing, which occur in both crocodilians and birds as well as other reptiles. Such vocalizations evolved independently in extant archosaurs numerous times, following increases in body size. The crests of the Lambeosaurini and nasal chambers of ankylosaurids have been suggested to function in vocal resonance, though Senter states that the presence of resonance chambers in some dinosaurs is not necessarily evidence of vocalization as modern snakes have such chambers which intensify their hisses.|$|E
500|$|Syringomyelia (SM) is a {{condition}} affecting the brain and spine, causing symptoms ranging from mild discomfort to severe pain and partial paralysis. It {{is caused by a}} malformation, commonly known as Chiari Malformation, in the lower back of the skull which reduces the space available to the brain, compressing it and often forcing it out (herniating it) through the opening into the spinal cord. This blocks the flow of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) around the brain and spine and increases the fluid's pressure, creating turbulence which in turn is believed to create fluid pockets, or <b>syrinxes</b> (hence the term syringomyelia), in the spinal cord. Syringomyelia is rare in most breeds but has become widespread in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, with international research samples {{in the past few years}} consistently showing over 90% of Cavaliers have the malformation, and that between 30–70% have <b>syrinxes.</b> However, most dogs with <b>syrinxes</b> are not symptomatic. [...] Although symptoms of syringomyelia can present at any age, they typically appear between six months and four years of age in 85% of symptomatic dogs, according to Clare Rusbridge, a research scientist. Symptoms include sensitivity around the head, neck, or shoulders, often indicated by a dog whimpering or frequently scratching at the area of his neck or shoulder. [...] Scratching is often unilateral– restricted to one side of the body. [...] Scratching motions are frequently performed without actually making physical contact with the body ("air scratching"). [...] The scratching behavior appears involuntary and the dog frequently scratches while walking– without stopping– in a way that is very atypical of normal scratching ("bunny hopping"). [...] Scratching typical of SM is usually worse when the dog is wearing a collar, is being walked on leash, or is excited, and first thing in the morning or at night.|$|R
40|$|Syringomyelia is a {{condition}} characterised by fluid filled cavities (<b>syrinxes</b> or syringes) within the central spinal cord and the resulting damage produces clinical signs of pain and neurological deficits. Since the increase in availability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), syringomyelia is an increasingly common diagnosis in veterinary medicine [1, 2] The {{most common cause of}} syringomyelia in the dog is Chiari-like malformation (Fig 1), {{a condition}} analogous to Chiari Type I and 0 malformation in humans [3, 4]...|$|R
50|$|The {{only other}} member of the {{subfamily}} is the white-eyed river martin Pseudochelidon sirintarae, known only from one site in Thailand and possibly extinct. These two species possess a number of features which distinguish them from other swallows and martins, including their robust legs and feet, stout bills, large <b>syrinxes</b> (vocal organs) and different bronchial structure. Genetic studies confirmed that the two river martins form a distinct clade from the typical swallows in the Hirundininae subfamily.|$|R
5|$|It soars high while {{searching for}} food, holding its wings {{horizontally}} when gliding. It flaps in short bursts which {{are followed by}} short periods of gliding. Its flight is less efficient than that of other vultures, as the wings are not as long, forming a smaller wing area. In comparison with the turkey vulture, the black vulture flaps its wings more frequently during flight. It is known to regurgitate when approached or disturbed, which assists in predator deterrence and taking flight by decreasing its takeoff weight. Like all New World vultures, the black vulture often defecates on its own legs, using the evaporation {{of the water in}} the feces and/or urine to cool itself, a process known as urohidrosis. It cools the blood vessels in the unfeathered tarsi and feet, and causes white uric acid to streak the legs. Because it lacks a <b>syrinx,</b> the black vulture, like other New World vultures, has very few vocalization capabilities. It is generally silent, but can make hisses and grunts when agitated or while feeding. The black vulture is , and roosts in large groups. In areas where their ranges overlap, the black vulture will roost on the bare branches of dead trees alongside groups of turkey vultures. The black vulture generally forages in groups; a flock of black vultures can easily drive a rival turkey vulture, which is generally solitary while foraging, from a carcass.|$|E
25|$|The <b>syrinx</b> is the sound-producing {{vocal organ}} of birds, {{located at the}} base of a bird's trachea. As with the {{mammalian}} larynx, sound is produced by the vibration of air flowing across the organ. The <b>syrinx</b> enables some species of birds to produce extremely complex vocalizations, even mimicking human speech. In some songbirds, the <b>syrinx</b> can produce more than one sound at a time.|$|E
25|$|The {{movement}} of gas through the larynx, pharynx and mouth allows humans to speak, or phonate. Vocalization, or singing, in birds occurs via the <b>syrinx,</b> an organ {{located at the}} base of the trachea.

50|$|The precise {{causes of}} syringomyelia are still unknown {{although}} blockage to {{the flow of}} cerebrospinal fluid {{has been known to}} be an important factor since the 1970s. Scientists in the UK and America continue to explore the mechanisms that lead to the formation of <b>syrinxes</b> in the spinal cord. It has been demonstrated a block to the free flow of cerebrospinal fluid is a contributory factor in the pathogenesis of the disease. Duke University in America and Warwick University are conducting research to explore genetic features of syringomyelia.|$|R
5000|$|Tui are {{considered}} to be very intelligent, much like parrots. They also resemble parrots in their ability to clearly imitate human speech, and were trained by Māori to replicate complex speech. Tui are also known for their noisy, unusual call, different for each individual, that combine bellbird-like notes with clicks, cackles, timber-like creaks and groans, and wheezing sounds. Songbirds have two voice boxes (<b>syrinxes)</b> [...] and this is what enables them to perform such a myriad of vocalisations. Tui song also exhibits geographical, microgeographic, seasonal, sex and individual variation.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Patients {{with pain}} or {{numbness}} without motor deficits {{are the most}} common group referred to electrophysiology laboratories as suspected radiculopathy. We wanted to investigate whether electromyography (EMG) was useful for this group in the diagnosis or therapy of radiculopathy. Our aim was to investigate the correlation and classification of EMG and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in the diagnosis of suspected radiculopathy. METHODS: We included 74 patients with a ≥ 2 -month history of numbness and pain in the neck and back that radiated into the arm or leg. Patients with diabetes mellitus, previous disc or spine operation, polyneuropathy, spinal cord diseases (tumor, infection or <b>syrinxs),</b> motor deficits, and abnormal nerve conduction studies were excluded.

25|$|Not all {{dogs with}} SM have {{clinical}} signs. The presence of signs is correlated to {{the width of}} the <b>syrinx</b> and extent of spinal cord dorsal horn damage. Syrinxes can progressively expand and a dog which is asymptomatic in early life may eventually experience pain.|$|E

40|$|The medical {{condition}} syringomyelia {{is characterized by}} the formation of large fluid-filled cavities in the spinal cord (called <b>syrinxes</b> in the medical literature). The exact mechanism by which these cavities form is not fully understood, although it has been theorized that changes in the pressure of the fluid surrounding the spinal cord could be responsible. There have been some studies carried out for the pressure levels in the cerebrospinal fluid [BW 81], but none of these is over the time scales that are necessary to verify that the pressure changes are the cause of syringomyelia. Generally, detailed experimental data is needed over a period of months or even years in order to verify this hypothesis. The alternative is to develop a mathematical model of the spinal cord and the surrounding liquid. A number of mathematical models of the spinal cord have been developed by applying various analytical and numerical methods to simulate the motion of the spinal cord and the surrounding liquid [CDB 05, LEB 06]...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of syringomyelia {{was investigated in}} a sample population of 555 Cavalier King Charles spaniels. All dogs, which were declared by their owners to be showing no clinical signs of syringomyelia, underwent MRI to determine {{the presence or absence}} of the condition. Data were analysed by logistic regression to determine the effects of sex and age on the {{prevalence of}} syringomyelia. Only increased age was found to have a significant effect. The prevalence of syringomyelia was 25 per cent in dogs aged 12 months, increasing to a peak of 70 per cent in dogs aged 72 months or more. SYRINGOMYELIA is an increasingly well-recognised condition affecting Cavalier King Charles spaniels (CKCS) due to the recent widespread availability of MRI in veterinary practice. The disease is characterised by the formation of fluid-filled cavities (<b>syrinxes)</b> within the parenchyma of the spinal cord and, in human beings, it has been associated with histological evidence of degeneration and ultrastruc-tural abnormalities within the spinal cord (Milhorat and others 1995).

40|$|A 66 -year-old {{woman with}} primary Sjogren {{syndrome}} developed syringomyelia following two episodes of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) {{due to the}} rupture of basilar artery aneurysms. Gait disturbance and abnormal sensation with pain over the foot and abdomen appeared 3 years after the last SAH. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed a syringomyelia throughout the thoracic cord, from the T 2 to T 11 levels. In addition, the thoracic cord was compressed by multiple arachnoid cysts in the ventral side of spinal cord. Computed tomography myelography revealed complete block of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow at the T 7 level.
