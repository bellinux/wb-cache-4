40|$|MBA - WBSIt is {{generally}} believed that software piracy harms both the software firms (through lower profits) and the buying customers (through higher prices) resulting in increasing efforts to counter software piracy by both software publishers and government. This study attempts {{to develop a}} profile of those who illegally copy software and determine the motivational factors underlying software piracy in South Africa in order to design effective measures to counteract software piracy. The study found that there are factors such as occupation, age, gender and computer expertise {{that can be used}} to profile a <b>software</b> <b>pirate.</b> In particular young male business students with expertise in computer usage were found to pirate software more frequently. There is limited support for levels of education or work experience influencing software piracy. The cost of the software followed by the ease of copying and the purpose of use were found to be strong motivating factors influencing software piracy Furthermore, the study shows that social acceptance and belief concerning the lack of consequences for software piracy have significant effects on software piracy intentions. Based on the above findings, anti-piracy campaigns and government efforts to eradicate software piracy should take into account the demographics of software pirates and ensure that the campaign messaging addresses the ethical wrongness of piracy together with stricter enforcements. In addition, software vendors should look at new and innovative ways of bundling additional services to software to allow consumers to feel the value add of purchasing software as opposed to pirating...|$|E

40|$|Determining why {{the roots}} of the {{disparity}} in national piracy levels lie beyond economics. According to the Software and Information Industry Association (SIIA), the worldwide revenue of business-based PC applications was $ 21. 6 billion in 1999, but global revenue losses due to piracy in the business application software market were calculated at $ 12 billion. These statistics drew attention not only because the losses attributed to piracy go beyond more than 50 % of revenues, but also because the world piracy rates showed an increase {{for the first time since}} 1995. Particularly troublesome is the concern that <b>software</b> <b>pirates</b> can single-handedly destroy the work of software developers, who invest millions dollars in software development proj-ects. Although special coding, fingerprinting, and other methods and techniques can protect software programs, no technological protection system yet devised is completely effective. In addition, despite the clear specifi-cation of property rights, piracy still can exist due to the high cost of policing con-sumer behavior and enforcing the law. As such, is likely that software piracy will remain a prevalent and a serious problem into the foreseeable future. The economics underlying the software markets have recently been identified as key Global software piracy has become an increasing concern to businesses and software developers throughout the world during the past two decades. For the U. S., which is generally considered the world leader in the software industry, the problem of piracy diminishes revenues and lessens investment in R&D, threatening the long-term viability of this important industry.

This is a subject with which I have some personal knowledge, not as an insider, but as someone who has been exposed to it from a very young age. I would like to note that I do not condone or excuse the practice of software piracy. The word “warez ” is modern slang for <b>pirated</b> <b>software,</b> music, movies or any illegal collection of copyrighted content made available in digital form. The word itself has a double meaning. In one connotation, “warez ” is short for software, but it also refers to the wares that a merchant has to offer (“Warez”). The “z ” {{at the end of the}} word comes from leetspeak, or “elite speak. ” This is the practice of obfuscating words by purposely misspelling them and replacing characters with numbers or symbols that resemble the letters they replace.
