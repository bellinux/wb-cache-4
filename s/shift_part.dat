In [...] "Paradigm <b>Shift</b> <b>Part</b> 2", Tinny battles Vett and discovers that he has the power to create force fields and project energy blasts. He has often been shown to be fully capable of becoming an officer, despite being so young. On several occasions he has shown the capability to both run the board at the FCPD independently and to be an officer on the field.|$|E

In [...] "Paradigm <b>Shift</b> <b>Part</b> 2," [...] Manx leaves Vertex's forces to assist the FCPD after hearing Vertex's true plans for the RollBots. Vertex attempts to have her destroyed for knowing his true plans.

As head of the FCPD, Captain Pounder is tough and strong. Despite this, he has a secret soft side. He gives the impression of knowing Vertex intimately, but avoids discussing it. It is hinted that he is after Vertex, although the reason behind this is unknown. He does consider Vertex to be a high priority target, however, {{it is obvious that}} he does not know that Vertex is (or is now) a Spiderbot, and always dismisses the idea. He is secretly monitoring Spin. He consistently communicates with someone who is involved with Spin in some way, but they only communicate through Pounder's computer. The Mayor forces Captain Pounder to fire Spin after he says that Vertex is a Spiderbot. When Spin is arrested, Captain Pounder declares him to be a dangerous criminal and wants Spin behind bars; but this is only a cover so he can {{keep a close eye on}} Spin to protect him from something (presumably Vertex). In [...] "Paradigm <b>Shift</b> <b>Part</b> 2", it is revealed that Pounder did know Vertex, as Vertex greeted him familiarly (such as when he called Pounder 'General'), and that Pounder can speak the Spiderbot language quite fluently. At the end of [...] "Paradigm <b>Shift</b> <b>Part</b> 2", Captain Pounder and Vertex fall through a hole in the safety net; but not before Pounder tells Spin that he is a member of the Zushin tribe. It was also revealed in Spin's flashback that Pounder lost his left eye after being attacked by Vertex.|$|E

However, in May of that year, Pietro Marzotto (son of Vittorio Emanuele, so great-great-grandson of Luigi), abruptly stopped negotiations, which led to Pietro‚Äôs resignation of his function as chief executive and the take-over by Jean de Jaeger, the first non-Marzotto to be promoted to such a function. Pietro nonetheless remained the majority shareholder of Marzotto S.p.A. and he purchased Litekas and Calw, a Lithuanian wool garments manufacturer, in 2000, so that the company could <b>shift</b> <b>part</b> of its production to the lower-cost market.

5000|$|Ms Appy (Nicole Oliver): A {{member of}} the Kazoku tribe, {{it was she who}} {{recommended}} that Spin join the FCPD. She was originally Spin's teacher and is currently Tinny's teacher. She has been a teacher at Wozville Elementary School for ten cycles, and is so dedicated that she hardly ever leaves the school grounds. She takes her students on a field trip to each tribe's headquarters once a cycle.http://rollbots.ytv.com/ When Spin wants to find out the truth about his origins, he asks Ms Appy if she knows anything, but she tells him that she does not remember because she has taught so many bots, and even calls Spin [...] "Spoon". When her Fangbot (a RollBot dog) Pikea goes missing after eating an invisibility bot mod, Ms Appy asks Spin to save him. While talking to Tinny, she accidentally tells him that Pikea is the last Fangbot of his kind. When Vertex catches Pikea, he says that the Fangbot looks familiar to him. After Spin saves Pikea and gives him back to Ms Appy, it appears that she knows more about Spin than she is letting on, and it also seems that she trained Pikea to protect Spin. It is revealed in [...] "Paradigm <b>Shift</b> <b>Part</b> 2" [...] that Captain Pounder brought Spin to her class as a BotTot after saving him from being destroyed by Vertex like {{the other members of the}} Zushin tribe.

The fastest RollBot in Flip City, Spin's bot mods include Skyv boots, hyper-speed, and boomstick. He joined the Kei'zatsu tribe, {{but he does not}} feel a sense of belonging. Described as a daredevil, Spin is known to get away with breaking rules.Spin is fired from his job as an FCPD officer after an incident with Vertex. He is declared a criminal when he attempts to stop a robbery because the FCPD arrive at the wrong moment and believe Spin to be the robber. It is hinted that Spin may be related to Vertex. Spin is the only rollbot who suspects that Vertex is a Spiderbot, and is ridiculed by everyone else because, as far as the rollbots of Spin City are concerned, Spiderbots do not exist. Spin has the ability to absorb radiation and use its power to disperse energy blasts and perform psychokinesis. In [...] "Paradigm <b>Shift</b> <b>Part</b> 2", it is revealed to Spin that he is the last member of the Zushin tribe, the only tribe that can talk to the Hub. He can use this connection to tell the Hub to do things like reset the safety net, or he can get emergency alerts on his comm, seconds before the Zoboshi or Kei'zatsu receive them. Spin is also acquainted with numerous bots around the city, including friends and enemies. He even seems to know the famous botball player, Roboto, on speaking terms.|$|E

50|$|Admiral Thornton‚Äôs {{desire is}} {{to engage the}} French in a fleet action. The second-in-command, Harte, has lesser goals. Harte sends Aubrey and Babbington {{on a mission to}} the north coast of Africa, with the notion that Babbington will be taken by the French ships in the neutral port Medina. Babbington sees the ships before he enters port and rejoins Worcester. Being told not to fire first at the French, Aubrey enters the neutral port in hopes the French ships will fire first, but they never do, so he returns, in the right but with Aubrey feeling his image is tarnished. Worcester brings Maturin to the coast of France, and waits to pick him up. Maturin's mission fails due to other British spies afoot. Waiting for the launch, Maturin finds the other British agent, Professor Graham, who has shot himself in the foot. Maturin hands him over to the Captain of the Fleet to act as a Turkish advisor. Later, the French fleet slips the blockade. Thornton is pleased, but the winds change, barring a {{successful}} engagement. The French do not want battle and return to port. A few shots were exchanged, killing the captain and first lieutenant of HMS Surprise. Further, Worcester, a poorly built ship, is strained beyond usefulness. Thornton tells Aubrey to take her to Malta to refit, then <b>shift</b> <b>part</b> of his crew to the Surprise for a mission to the Seven Islands on the Ionian coast. As they sail, a poetry contest is set up, with Mowett and Rowan splitting the prize. Then Surprise takes the blockade runner Bonhomme Richard, filled with spices, dyes, and heaps of silver. The silver is shared out at once, and Rowan takes the prize to Malta. Aubrey visits the three beys, Ismail, Mustapha and Sciahon, choosing the last as the best ally for Britain to take Corfu, if not more of the Seven Islands, from the French. Sciahon Bey holds Kutali, the preferred base for naval operations.|$|E

The thermal properties of pure phase change materials (PCMs) {{and those of the}} mixtures of PCMs with cellulose insulation were studied via differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) tests and mass change tests. To directly prove the concept that PCM-enhanced insulation can reduce the peak heat flux across walls as well as its potential to <b>shift</b> <b>part</b> of the space cooling loads to a later time of the day, the performance of PCM-enhanced cellulose insulation was studied using two small-scale testing houses exposed to full weather conditions during the summer seasons. The testing houses were air conditioned and independently metered. Both houses had identical thermal responses prior to any retrofits. Before the tests, the PCM enhanced insulation was blown into the wall cavities in one test house while plain cellulose insulation was installed in the other house for comparison purposes. Hourly heat fluxes and daily heat flow data for four walls are presented. Based on the results, important recommendations are provided for the optimal use of PCMs in insulation systems...|$|E
