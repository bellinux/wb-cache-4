Remote sensing images provided perimeters of fires ≥ 30 ha, which were used to characterize the temporal patterns of fire occurrence in Catalonia. Several fire frequency models were used to reproduce the observed pattern of wildfires occurrence in the study period. Natural fire rotation period was estimated to be 133 years. Poisson tests were carried out to check random fire occurrence either along the time period or across the analysed region. Observed fires were not randomly generated either in space or in time, despite being sampled using two different plot sizes. This sampling design was also used for Mean Fire Interval (MFI) analysis, which allowed us to significantly fit a Weibull distribution to the observed proportion of fire intervals (for both sample sizes), enabling us to estimate the hazard of burning, mortality, and <b>survivorship</b> <b>functions.</b> Finally, MFI was also applied to forest regions of Catalonia, which are defined according to forest management plans based on their homogeneous climatic conditions.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of haploid and diploid {{phases of the}} life cycle is investigated theoretically, using a model where the relative length of haploid and diploid phases is under genetic control. The model assumes that selection occurs in both phases and that fitness in each phase {{is a function of the}} time spent in that phase. The equilibrium and stability conditions that allow for all-haploid, all-diploid, or polyphasic life cycles are considered for general <b>survivorship</b> <b>functions.</b> Types of stable life cycles possible depend on the form of the viability selection. If mortality rates are constant, either haploidy or diploidy is the only stable life cycle possible. Departures from constant mortality can give qualitatively different results. For example, when survivorship in each phase is a linear, decreasing function of the time spent in the phase, stable haploid, diploid or polyphasic life cycles are possible. The addition of genetic variation at a coevolving viability locus does not qualitatively affect the outcome with respect to the maintenance of polyphasic cycles but can lead to situations where more than one life cycle is concurrently stable. These results show that trade-offs between the advantages of being diploid and of being haploid may help explain the patterns of life cycles found in nature and that the type of selection may be critical to determining the results...|$|R

Hatching characteristics of eggs stored at 7 °C for 0 – 28 weeks in the lab and following maintenance overwinter in a lake are described. The hatching success of eggs stored for 4 – 28 weeks remained constant (71 – 81 %) but slightly less than that observed in fresh eggs (90 %). The hatching success of eggs kept overwinter under natural conditions did not differ from that of eggs stored an equivalent length of time in the lab at 7 °C (74 · 7 and 75 · 8 %, respectively). With the exception of fresh eggs (17 · 7 days), the mean hatch time of eggs steadily decreased with increased storage time (18 · 9 days following 4 weeks storage to 11 · 4 days at 28 weeks storage) due to a slow embryonation of the eggs at 7 °C. Hatching characteristics of a subsample of eggs incubated at 10, 15 and 20 °C were compared and the embryonation rate was found to increase with incubation temperature. The majority of eggs stored at 10 °C embryonated but failed to hatch. When their incubation temperature was raised to 15 °C, a further 46 % hatched within the following week.

40|$|Background: The gamma-Gompertz {{model is}} a fixed frailty model in which {{baseline}} mortality increases exponentially with age, frailty has a proportional effect on mortality, and frailty at birth follows a gamma distribution. Mortality selects against the more frail, so the marginal mortality rate decelerates, eventually reaching an asymptote. The gamma-Gompertz {{is one of a}} wider class of frailty models, characterized by the choice of baseline mortality, effects of frailty, distributions of frailty, and assumptions about the dynamics of frailty. Objective: To develop a matrix model to compute all the statistical properties of longevity from the gamma-Gompertz and related models. Methods: I use the vec-permutation matrix formulation to develop a model in which individuals are jointly classified by age and frailty. The matrix is used to project the age and frailty dynamics of a cohort and the fundamental matrix is used to obtain the statistics of longevity. Results: The model permits calculation of the mean, variance, coefficient of variation, skewness and all moments of longevity, the marginal mortality and <b>survivorship</b> <b>functions,</b> the dynamics of the frailty distribution, and other quantities. The matrix formulation extends naturally to other frailty models. I apply the analysis to the gamma-Gompertz model (for humans and laboratory animals), the gamma-Makeham model, and the gamma-Siler model, and to a hypothetical dynamic frailty model characterized by diffusion of frailty with reflecting boundaries. The matrix model permits partitioning the variance in longevity into components due to heterogeneity and to individual stochasticity. In several published human data sets, heterogeneity accounts for less than 10 % of the variance in longevity. In laboratory populations of five invertebrate animal species, heterogeneity accounts for 46 % to 83 % of the total variance in longevity...|$|R

But within-group variance is very large even in narrowly defined groups, and it varies strongly and inversely with the group average length of life. We show that variance in length of life is inversely related to the Gompertz slope of log mortality through age, and we reveal its relationship to variance in a multiplicative frailty index. Our findings bear a variety of implications for modeling and forecasting mortality. In particular, we examine how the assumption of proportional hazards fails to account adequately for differences in subgroup variance, and we discuss how several common forecasting models treat the variance along the temporal dimension. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. New {{models for}} {{evolutionary}} processes of mutation accumulation allow hypotheses about the age-specificity of mutational effects to {{be translated into}} predictions of heterogeneous population hazard functions. We apply these models to questions in the biodemography of longevity, including proposed explanations of Gompertz hazards and mortality plateaus, {{and use them to}} explore the possibility of melding evolutionary and functional models of aging. 1. Mutation Accumulation Why are flies, worms, and humans subject to laws of age-specific adult mortality that are uncannily similar in shape? After suitable species-specific changes in scale, organisms with different environments, life histories, body plans, and lifespans turn out to resemble each other in the statistics of their demise. Similarities are typically expressed in terms of hazard functions.

A time-varying distributed delay model, simulating the successive occurrences of egg hatching, nymph presence, and adult emergence, is extended here to represent multi-generation infestation patterns of grapevine plants inhabited by eggs, nymphs, and adults. The model extension includes intrinsic mortality, mortality caused by plant dormancy, and low temperatures, development of diapausing and post-diapausing eggs, fecundity rates, and adult longevity. Field observations and published data were used to estimate parameters.

MethodsOver a period of 15 years, 310 out of 318 consecutive nonacute patients (age 64. 7 ± 8. 6) received 341 endothelialized ePTFE grafts (308 femoropopliteal: 153 above knee [AK] and 155 below knee [BK] and 33 femorodistal). Autologous endothelial cells were harvested from short segments (3. 9 ± 1. 1 cm) of subcutaneous veins (80 % cephalic, 11 % basilic, 2 % external jugular, and 7 % saphenous) and grown to mass cultures within 18. 9 ± 4. 5 days before being confluently lined onto fibrin glue-coated ePTFE grafts. The graft diameter was 6 mm (64 %) or 7 mm (36 %). The overall procedure-related delay for graft implantation was 27. 6 + 7. 8 days. Growth failure prevented 2. 5 % of patients from receiving an endothelialized graft. The mean observation period was 9. 6 years. Primary patencies were obtained from Kaplan-Meier <b>survivorship</b> <b>functions.</b> Explants for morphological analysis were obtained from eight patients. ResultsThe overall primary patency rate of femoropopliteal grafts was 69 % at 5 years (68 % [AK] vs 71 % [BK]) and 61 % at 10 years (59 % [AK] vs 64 % [BK]). Primary patency of 7 mm vs 6 mm grafts was 78 %/ 62 % at 5 years and 71 %/ 55 % at 10 years. The {{difference between the two}} groups was statistically significant (log rank test P =. 023; Breslow test P =. 017). Stage I vs II/III patients showed 5 -year patencies of 67 % vs 73 % (N. S.) and 10 -year patencies of 61 %% vs 53 % (N. S.). The primary patency of femorodistal grafts was 52 % at 5 years and 36 % at 10 years. The limb salvage rate was 94 % (fempop) vs 86 % (femdistal) at 5 years and 89 % vs 71 % at 10 years. All retrieved samples showed the presence of an endothelium after 38. 9 ± 17. 8 months.

The amount of play increased rapidly thereafter, remaining relatively high until about day 40. Playing then decreased, becoming sporadic by day 54.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the temporal pattern of feed and water intake behaviour of gestating sows housed in a dynamic group. The dataset included 90 sows (parity 1 to 7). Feed and water intake were recorded by electronic feeding and drinking stations. To describe the feed and water intake behaviour single visits were combined into meals and drinking bouts. A log <b>survivorship</b> <b>function</b> identified the characteristic interval length to differentiate between two bouts. Interval lengths larger than 12 min separated two meals (29 min two drinking bouts). The meal and drinking bout criteria were used to derive the following traits: feeding and drinking duration per day (FD, DD), interval duration within feeding (pauseF) or drinking (pauseW) meal, feeding and drinking meal duration per day (FMD, DMD) and feeding and drinking visits per day (FV, DV). Additionally, an eating rank was calculated according to the order of the sows at the feeding station. The results showed that nulliparous and primiparous sows had higher FD, pauseF, FMD and FV in contrast to biparous and multiparous sows (P < 0. 05). The DD of primiparous sows was significantly lower than that of older sows. The eating rank increased over time while nulliparous sows increased their rank more slowly than older sows. Low to moderate repeatabilities were found for feed intake traits (0. 23 to 0. 41); higher repeatabilities for drinking traits (0. 45 to 0. 55) and eating rank (0. 71) indicating high variation between sows, which could be used for the identification of diseases...|$|E

Methods: Adult (≥ 18 years) {{survivors of the}} 11 most frequently diagnosed cancers were identified from publically available data sources, including the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results 9 1973 – 2012, National Health Interview Survey 2013, and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey 2011. Chi-square tests and one-way analyses of variance were utilized to assess differences between cancer survivors and non-cancer controls in behavioral characteristics, symptoms and functions, preventative screenings, and health care costs. Results: Hematologic malignancies, melanoma, and breast, prostate, lung, colon/rectal, bladder, kidney/renal, uterine, thyroid, and pancreatic cancers had the highest incidence rates. Breast cancer had the highest incidence among women (156. 4 per 100, 000) and prostate cancer among men (167. 2 per 100, 000). The presence of pain (P= 0. 0003), fatigue (P= 0. 0005), and sadness (P= 0. 0012) was consistently higher in cancer survivors 40 – 64 years old vs. non-cancer controls. Cancer survivors ≥ 65 years old had higher rates of any functional limitations (P= 0. 0039) and reported a lack of exercise (P< 0. 0001) compared with the non-cancer controls. However, obesity rates were similar between cancer survivors and non-cancer controls. Among cancer survivors, an estimated 13. 5 million spent $ 169. 4 {{billion a year on}} treatment, with the highest direct expenditures for breast cancer ($ 39 billion), prostate cancer ($ 37 billion), and hematologic malignancies ($ 25 billion). Prescription medications and office-based visits contributed equally as the cost drivers of direct medical spending for breast cancer, while inpatient hospitalization was the driver for prostate (52. 8 %) and lung (38. 6 %) cancers.

Cumulative survival with arthroplasty as the endpoint ranged from 64 to 82 % at 10 years, and 45 % at 15 years. The mean pre-operative HSS score ranged from 46 to 65 and this improved at latest follow up to means of between 72 and 88. Pooled results show an overall complication rate of 5. 8 % (5 / 86) for unanticipated re-operation due to a complication.

40|$|Under the {{increasing}} threat of climate change, {{it is imperative}} to understand the impact that environmental phenomena have on the demography and behavior of natural populations. In the last few decades an ever increasing body of research has documented dramatic changes in mortality rates and breeding phenology for a large number of species. A number of these have been attributed to the current trends in climate change, which have been particularly conspicuous in bird populations. However, datasets associated to these natural populations {{as well as to the}} environmental variables that affect their biology tend to be partial and incomplete. Thus, ecological research faces the urgent need to tackle these questions while at the same time develop inferential models that can handle the complex structure of these datasets and their associated uncertainty. Therefore, my dissertation research has focused on two main objectives: 1) to understand the relationship that demographic rates and breeding phenology of a colony of seabirds has with the environment in the context of climate change; and 2) to use and develop models that can encompass the complex structure of these natural systems, while also extending the process not only to inference but to building predictions. I divided this work in three research projects; for the first one I developed a hierarchical Bayesian model for age-specific survival for long lived species with capture-recapture data that allows the use of incomplete data (i. e. left-truncated and right-censored), and builds predictions of years of birth and death for all individuals while also drawing inference on the <b>survivorship</b> <b>function.</b> I compared this method to more traditional ones and address their limitations and advantages. My second research chapter makes use of this method to determine the age-specific survivorship of the Dry Tortugas sooty tern population, and explores the effect of changes in sea surface temperature on their cohort mortality rates. Finally, my third research chapter addresses the dramatic shift in breeding season experienced by the Dry Tortugas sooty tern colony, the most unprecedented shift reported for any bird species. I explore the role of climatic and weather variables as triggering mechanisms. Dissertatio...|$|E
40|$|The present {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development of mathematical models for structured population species. The structuring or classification may be due to age, stage of development or a combination of both in a more general perspective. The class of matrix population models are examples of such models and {{have been the subject of}} theoretical and practical study for many years. In this work attention is focussed on vector population species which are carriers of disease agents for animals. This has therefore necessitated the investigation of a class of models which deal with the interaction of vector population species and the host population. In particular the study combines both discrete and continuous population models in order to achieve its goal. Multi-dimensional coupled differential equations have proved handy in this respect. Chapter I gives a general introduction to the work. In section 1. 1 an introductory description of mathematical population models is given. In section 1. 2 an overview of preliminary concepts and notations are introduced. In this section a brief description of matrix population models and continuous time models is also given. A brief review of relevant literature is presented in section 1. 3. In this section, literature review specific to a stage structured population species, the brown ear tick is also given. Sections 1. 4 and 1. 5 deal with the statement of the problem together with the specific objectives' of the study. In section 1. 6 the importance of this study is briefly mentioned. in the last section of the chapter the methodology ofhow data was acquired and analysed is given. This section is important because the study involved a practical application to validate the models. The data was for the three host brown el;&,r. tick the causal vector for East Coast fever. Chapter II reviews basic models for age structured populations. After a brief introduction we present the Lotka's Integral equation in section 2. 2 where age and time are treated as continuous variables. The solution to this equation is reviewed in section 2. 3 first by elementary mathematical methods in sub-section 2. 3. 1 and by Laplace transforms in sub-section 2. 3 -. 2. In particular it is shown that the solution has a real root which determines the direction of increase of a population. The asymptotic behaviour. ofthe solution is given in sub-section 2. 3. 3. In section 2. 4 we review the partial differential equation describing the evolution of the population density n(x, t) which is known as the McKendrick-von Foester equation. This model is a hyperbolic initial boundary value problem. Section 2. 5 deals with the discretized age and time matrix model which requires a thorough understanding of the life table <b>survivorship</b> <b>function,</b> presented in sub- section 2. 5. 1. The actual formulation of the matrix model is given in sub- section 2. 5. 2. It is in this section where we demonstrate the connection of the matrix model and the McKendrick von Foerster model. One of the core problem in application of matrix population models is in the estimation of the matrix inputs. The derivation of the inputs is discussed in section 2. 6 for two types of populations namely the birth flowpopulations and birth pulse populations. These are presented in sub-section 2. 6. 1 and 2. 6. 2 respectively. Chapter III deals with the time homogeneous matrix model and its properties. After an introduction in section 3. 1 the model is presented in section 3. 2 for an age structured population. The chapter brings in the idea of the complete population projection matrix which includes both pre- and post- reproductive individuals. It isshownthat after a long enough time it is the pre-reproductive part of the population which determines the projection matrix of interest. Section 3. 3 outlines a list ofproperties of the population projection matrix. The theory of directed graphs wasused quite extensively to achieve 'this. The Perron-Frobenius theorem for both primitive and irreducible matrices is generally stated since it is important in the study of the limiting properties of the population projections. Sub- section 3. 3. 1 thus talks about the stable population theory showing the asymptotic behaviour ofthe population structure~ It is shown that the limiting population structure is independent of the initial population structure. This property is egordic in nature. Upto section 3. 3 the population is structured according to age but the aim of the study is to generalise the classification. Thus in section 3. 4 we present a generalized matrix model where classification is according to hath stage of development and according to age within the stage. This model is more general and can be used to study the dynamics of many population species such as insects, arthropods, plants and many more. Estimation of to matrix inputs for such a model is discussed in section 3. 5. In sub-section 3. 5. 1 we consider estimation from transition frequency data while in sub-section 3. 5. 2 we consider estimation from stage duration data. Finally in sub-section 3. 5. 3 we consider estimation from experimental cumulative distributions. The connection between the transition probabilities in the classical Leslie model and those from experimental cumulative distributions is given in section 3. 6. In chapter IV we present a mathematical model for the brown ear tick which is a three host tick and is a vector for the East Coast fever(ECF). It is a stage structured population. In section 4. 1 we present several modeling approaches including terminology and definitions. In section 4. 2 we present a continuous time compartmental model, cyclic in nature. The model is related to that by Metz and Diekmann(1986) for physiologically structured populations since individuals have to age within a stage with reference to chronological time before transitting to the next stage. The characteristic polynomial for the system is derived in this section and the dependence of the spectral bound on various population parameters is discussed through the implicit function theorem. We also derive the general persistent stage structure in this section. Section 4. 3 gives a discussion on vector-host interaction where an additional equation describing the dynamics of the host population is added into thesystem of the 11 coupled differential equations mentioned above. Conditions for population increase or decline and co-existence of the pop- ~, ulation species are discussed. The reproduction number for the tick population as a function of host density is also discussed. Section 4. 4 gives a discussion on the stability analysis of the model. Section 4. 5 is on the phenomenon of competition of ticks on host which acts 'as-a regulatory mechanism for the population species not to increase without bound. In sub-section 4. 5. 1 we give a discussion of generalcyclic triangular systems with respect to density dependence on mortality and transition rates. An alternative method of deriving the reproduction number is also presented. In sub-section 4. 5. 2 we present a discussion on positive invariance paying attention to the qualitative behaviour of the s-ystem, distinguishing where the system is dissipative. In order to establish dissipativeness we find a bounded set that attracts all orbits and which is positive invariant. Sub-section 4. 5. 3 is on the connection between spectral radius and spectral bound; while we finish this' chapter with a simulation experiment of the model based on the brown ear tick data. In chapter V we consider the spatial distribution of the tick vector populattion. Section 5. 1 is an introduction to this topic. Section 5. 2 discusses on host distribution ofvector parasites then we derive the model in sub-section 5. 2. 1. The nullhypothesis that the on host distribution of parasites is in general asymmetric and follows the negative binomial distribution is discussed in detail. Sub-section 5. 2. 2 discusses the parameter estimation in the model by the MLE method, assumingthe parameters are functions of several host-specific attributes. In section 5. 3 density dependence and host heterogeneity on susceptibility to parasites is discussed. The effect of this on the stability of the parasite-host model is discussed insub- section 5. 3. 1. Section 5. 4 is about the effect of on host parasite load on the reproduction ratio of the parasite population. The general model is discussed in sub-sections 5. 4. 1 and 5. 4. 2. Section 5. 5 suggests a possible area of future study aimingtowards a general stochastic dynamical model particularly with respect to vectorparasite populations such as ticks. Inchapter VI wedemonstrate an application of the already developed theories tothebrown ear tick(R. appendiculatus) based on Zimbabwe data. The application isbased on a time dependent multiple matrix model incorporating seasonality and heterogeneity in the vegetation. Section 6. 1 gives a general introduction while the, model is given in section 6. 2. In section 6. 3 we deal with the problem of matrix parametrization estimating all the required matrices in the system stating all the assumptions made: Section 6. 4 is on sensitivity analysis of the model parameters and conclusions. In chaptef Vll some comments regarding the significance of the results arrived at in this thesis are made. Some areas which we think need further investigation are also pointed out...|$|E
40|$|A simple {{age-specific}} energetics (calories or biomass) {{model for}} the growth and development, reproduction, respiration, ageing, and intrinsic <b>survivorship</b> as a <b>function</b> of temperature and per capita energy availability for pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris)) is reported. The ratio of energy supply-demand is used to scale all of the rates in the model. The maximum demand for energy based upon current state values is used to drive the Frazer-Gilbert functional response model (i. e. food acquisition), which is {{a component of the}} metabolic pool model used to assimilate energy to growth, reproduction, respiration, and egestion. The extensive data sets on pea aphid energetics published by Randolph et al. (1975) were used to develop the model. As the model estimates reproduction (Mx) and survivorship (Lx) values, extensive published age-specific life-data sets on pea aphids are used to test it. The results suggest: (1) the lower thermal threshold for development is raised and the upper threshold is lowered as food resources are decreased (2) the temperature-dependent rate of development is slowed with decreasing energy resources (3) the size of individuals and reproduction become smaller as temperature approaches the upper and lower thermal thresholds. A simple model for multitrophic level interactions incorporating the acquisition and assimilation functions is presente...|$|R
40|$|The {{chapters}} {{in this thesis}} examine the post-fire and post-salvage natural regeneration dynamics of Picea mariana (black spruce) and Pinus banksiana (jack pine). The first examines the compaction of the post-fire organic layer by snow {{and its effects on}} seedling recruitment. We found that compression occured but at an insufficient rate to seriously increase seedling establishment. There was a positive relationship between the initial thickness of the burned organic layer depth and the subsequent amount of compression. The second chapter examines the post-fire abscission schedule of these two species. We found that seed abscission begins immediately following fire, with jack pine having a faster rate of abscission than black spruce. The third chapter presents a post-fire and post-salvage natural regeneration model that includes (1) the abscission schedule from Chapter two, (2) seed availability as a function of basal area, salvage proportion and timing; (3) seedling <b>survivorship</b> as a <b>function</b> of seed mass, seedbed type frequencies, first summer ash, and granivory; (4) seedling and seed mortality as a function of salvage operations; and (5) re-dispersal of salvaged seeds via a chipper. Simulations indicate that a delay in salvage timing and/or a reduction in salvage proportion can yield adequate natural regeneration densities, thereby foregoing the costly need to plan...|$|R
40|$|Background Gender-specific {{differences}} in knee and hip anatomy {{have been well}} documented. Although it has been accepted these differences exist, there is controversy regarding if and how these differences should be addressed with gender-specific implant designs. Questions/purposes (1) What are the anatomic and mor-phologic differences, if any, in the knee and hip {{between men and women}}? (2) Do gender-specific TKA designs provide better clinical <b>functioning,</b> <b>survivorship,</b> and improved fit in women? (3) How have anatomic differ-ences in the hip been addressed, if at all, by THA? Methods We conducted a systematic review of the MEDLINE database to identify all articles reviewing basic science and clinical outcomes of gender-specific total knee and total hip implants. From these, we reviewed 253 studies. Results The anatomic studies elucidated multiple differ-ences in the anatomy of knees and hips between men and women. All reviewed studies report similar clinical func-tion and satisfaction scores between men and women for gender-specific TKA and no improvement in these scores when comparing gender-specific TKA to unisex TKA. Current modularity in THA appears to accommodate any anatomic {{differences in}} the hip. Conclusions Based on the available literature, there is no difference in the outcome of patients with a gender-specific knee arthroplasty versus a unisex arthroplasty. It does not appear gender-specific THAs would provide any benefit over current systems...|$|R
40|$|Species-specific enemies may promote prey {{coexistence}} through negative distance- and density-dependent {{survival of}} juveniles near conspecific adults. We tested this mechanism by transplanting juvenile-sized {{fragments of the}} brooding corals Pocillopora damicornis and Seriatopora hystrix 3, 12, 24 and 182 cm up- and down-current of conspecific adults and monitoring their survival and condition over time. We also characterized the spatial distribution of P. damicornis and S. hystrix within replicate plots on three Fijian reef flats and measured the distribution of small colonies within 2 m of larger colonies of each species. Juvenile-sized transplants exhibited no differences in <b>survivorship</b> as a <b>function</b> of distance from adult P. damicornis or S. hystrix. Additionally, both P. damicornis and S. hystrix were aggregated rather than overdispersed on natural reefs. However, a pattern of juveniles being aggregated near adults while larger (and probably older) colonies were not suggests that greater mortality near large adults could occur over {{longer periods of time}} or that size-dependent mortality was occurring. While we found minimal evidence of greater mortality of small colonies near adult conspecifics in our transplant experiments, we did document hot-spots of species-specific corallivory. We detected spatially localized and temporally persistent predation on P. damicornis by the territorial triggerfish Balistapus undulatus. This patchy predation did not occur for S. hystrix. This variable selective regime in an otherwise more uniform environment could be one mechanism maintaining diversity of corals on Indo-Pacific reefs...|$|R
40|$|The Janzen-Connell {{hypothesis}} {{proposes that}} species-specific enemies promote species coexistence through distance- and density-dependent survival of offspring near conspecific adults. I tested this hypothesis experimentally by transplanting juvenile-sized fragments of {{two species of}} brooding corals varying distances from conspecific adults, and observationally by assessing the spatial distribution of those two species in the field. Small fragments (as proxies for ? 6 month old juveniles) of Pocillopora damicornis and Seriatopora hystrix were transplanted 3, 12, 24 and 182 cm upstream and downstream (relative to the prevailing current) of conspecific adults and their survivorship and condition (bitten off, overgrown by algae, or bleached) checked every 1 - 2 d. I also characterized the spatial distribution of P. damicornis and S. hystrix within replicated plots on three Fijian reef flats and measured densities of small colonies within 2 m of larger colonies of each species. Contrary to the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, juvenile-sized transplants exhibited no differences in <b>survivorship</b> as a <b>function</b> of distance from adult P. damicornis or S. hystrix and P. damicornis and S. hystrix were aggregated rather than overdispersed on natural reefs. Survival unaffected by distance from focal colonies as well as certain recruitment processes could generate the observed aggregation. I did observe predation of P. damicornis that was spatially patchy and temporally persistent due to feeding by the territorial triggerfish Balistapus undulatus. This patchy predation did not occur for S. hystrix. Thus, I found no support for the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, but did document hot-spots of species-specific corallivory that could create variable selective regimes on an otherwise more uniform environment, and help maintain the high diversity of corals typical of Indo-Pacific reefs.

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} {{the spectrum of}} malignancies in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected children and the clinical outcome of patients with these tumors. Methods: We retrospectively surveyed the Children's Cancer Group (CCG) and the National Cancer institute (NCI) for cases of cancer that occurred between July 1982 and February 1997 in children who were HIV seropositive before or {{at the time of}} cancer diagnosis, We used Kaplan-Meier <b>survivorship</b> curves, hazard <b>function</b> estimates, and Cox proportional hazards models to evaluate survival. Results: Sixty-four children (39 boys, 25 girls) with 65 tumors were reported, Thirty-seven children (58 %) acquired HN infection vertically (median age at cancer diagnosis, 4. 3 years); 22 children (34 %) acquired HIV through transfusion of blood or blood products (median age at cancer diagnosis, 13. 4 years). Forty-two children (65 %) had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), Eleven children (17 %) had leiomyosarcomas (or leiomyomas), which are otherwise exceptionally rare in children. Other malignancies included acute leukemia (five children), Kaposi's sarcoma (KS; three children), Hodgkin's disease (two children), vaginal carcinoma in situ (one child), and tracheal neuroendocrine carcinoma (one child), Median survival after NHL diagnosis was 6 months (range, 1 day to 89 months) and after leiomyosarcoma was 12 months (range, 10 days to 19 months), The average monthly death rate after NHL diagnosis was 12 % in the first 6 months, which decreased to about 2 % thereafter In contrast, the monthly death rate after leiomyosarcoma diagnosis increased from 5 % in the first 6 months to about 20 % thereafter. Conclusion: After NHL, leiomyosarcoma is the sec and reading cancer in children with HIV infection, Bath cancers have high mortality rates; improved outcome for NHL, in particular, may depend on earlier diagnosis and therapy.

40|$|Suspended sediments {{produced}} from dredging activities, or {{added to the}} sediment budget via river runoff, are a concern for marine resource managers. Understanding the impact of suspended sediments on critical life history stages of keystone species like corals is fundamental to effective management of coastlines and reefs. Coral embryos (Acropora tenuis and A. millepora) and larvae (A. tenuis, A. millepora and Pocillopora acuta) were subjected {{to a range of}} suspended sediment concentrations of different sediment types (siliciclastic and carbonate) to assess concentration-response relationships on ecologically relevant endpoints, including survivorship and ability to metamorphose. Embryos were subjected to short (12 h) suspended sediment exposures from ages of 3 - 12 hours old or a long (30 h) exposure at 6 hours old. Neither the <b>survivorship</b> nor metamorphosis <b>function</b> of embryos were significantly affected by realistic sediment exposures to ~ 1000 mg L- 1. However, some embryos exhibited a previously undescribed response to dynamically suspended sediments, which saw 10 % of the embryos form negatively buoyant cocoons at siliciclastic suspended sediment concentrations ≥ 35 mg L- 1. Scanning electron and optical microscopy confirmed the presence of a coating on these embryos, possibly mucus with incorporated sediment particles. Cocoon formation was common in embryos but not in larvae, and occurred more often after exposure to siliciclastic rather than carbonate sediments. Once transferred into sediment-free seawater, functional ~ 36 -h-old embryos began emerging from the cocoons, coinciding with cilia development. Ciliated (> 36 -h-old) larvae exposed to suspended sediments for 60 h were also observed to secrete mucus and were similarly unaffected by suspended sediment concentrations to ~ 800 mg L- 1. This study provides evidence that mucous secretion and cilia beating effectively protect coral embryos and larvae from suspended sediment and that these mechanisms may enhance their chances of successful recruitment...|$|R
