5|$|After {{the work}} of John R. Carson in 1915 {{it became clear that}} {{multiplexed}} telephone transmissions could be greatly improved by the use of single sideband <b>suppressed</b> <b>carrier</b> (SSB) transmission. Compared to basic amplitude modulation (AM) SSB has the advantage of half the bandwidth and a fraction of the power (one sideband can have no more than 1/6 of the total power and would typically be a lot less). AM analysed in the frequency domain consists of a carrier and two sidebands. The carrier wave in AM represents the majority of the transmitted power but contains no information whatsoever. The two sidebands both contain identical information so only one is required, at least from an information transmission point of view. Up to this point filtering had been by simple tuned circuits. However, SSB required a flat response over the sideband of interest and maximum rejection of the other sideband with a very sharp transition between the two. As the idea was to put another (completely different) signal in the slot vacated by the unwanted sideband it was important that all traces of it were removed to prevent crosstalk. At the same time minimum distortion (i.e. flat response) is obviously desirable for the sideband being retained. This requirement led to a big research effort in the design of electric wave filters.|$|E
25|$|Another {{improvement}} over standard AM is obtained through reduction or {{suppression of the}} carrier component of the modulated spectrum. In Figure 2 this is the spike in between the sidebands; even with full (100%) sine wave modulation, the power in the carrier component is twice that in the sidebands, yet it carries no unique information. Thus {{there is a great}} advantage in efficiency in reducing or totally suppressing the carrier, either in conjunction with elimination of one sideband (single-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission) or with both sidebands remaining (double sideband <b>suppressed</b> <b>carrier).</b> While these <b>suppressed</b> <b>carrier</b> transmissions are efficient in terms of transmitter power, they require more sophisticated receivers employing synchronous detection and regeneration of the carrier frequency. For that reason, standard AM continues to be widely used, especially in broadcast transmission, to allow for the use of inexpensive receivers using envelope detection. Even (analog) television, with a (largely) suppressed lower sideband, includes sufficient carrier power for use of envelope detection. But for communications systems where both transmitters and receivers can be optimized, suppression of both one sideband and the carrier represent a net advantage and are frequently employed.|$|E
2500|$|Aircraft {{communications}} {{radio operations}} worldwide use amplitude modulation, predominantly A3E double sideband with full carrier on VHF and UHF, and J3E single sideband with <b>suppressed</b> <b>carrier</b> on HF. Besides being simple, power-efficient and compatible with legacy equipment, AM and SSB permit stronger stations to override weaker or interfering stations. Additionally, this method does not {{suffer from the}} capture effect found in FM. Even if a pilot is transmitting, a control tower can [...] "talk over" [...] that transmission and other aircraft will hear a somewhat garbled mixture of both transmissions, rather than just one or the other. Even if both transmissions are received with identical signal strength, a heterodyne will be heard where no such indication of blockage would be evident in an FM system.|$|E

40|$|We {{developed}} a multi-mode ground state cooling technique based on electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT). By involving an additional ground and excited state, two individually adjustable bright states {{together with a}} dark state are created. While the dark state <b>suppresses</b> <b>carrier</b> scattering, the two bright states are brought into resonance with spectrally separated motional red sidebands. With this double-bright EIT (D-EIT) cooling scheme, we experimentally demonstrate ground state cooling of all three motional modes of a trapped $^{ 40 }$Ca$^+$ with a single cooling pulse. The approach is scalable to more than two bright states by introducing laser couplings to additional states.

2500|$|One {{method of}} {{producing}} an SSB signal {{is to remove}} one of the sidebands via filtering, leaving only either the upper sideband (USB), the sideband with the higher frequency, or less commonly the lower sideband (LSB), the sideband with the lower frequency. Most often, the carrier is reduced or removed entirely (suppressed), being referred to in full as single sideband <b>suppressed</b> <b>carrier</b> (SSBSC). Assuming both sidebands are symmetric, which {{is the case for}} a normal AM signal, no information is lost in the process. [...] Since the final RF amplification is now concentrated in a single sideband, the effective power output is greater than in normal AM (the carrier and redundant sideband account for well over half of the power output of an AM transmitter). Though SSB uses substantially less bandwidth and power, it cannot be demodulated by a simple envelope detector like standard AM.|$|E

With increasing gate dielectric constant, we observe increasing trap DOS close to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the QDs. In addition, this increase is also consistently followed by broadening of the trap DOS. We rationalize that the increase and broadening of the spectral trap distribution originate from dipolar disorder as well as polaronic interactions, which are appearing at strong dielectric polarization.

40|$|We {{study the}} spatial decay of spin {{polarized}} hot carrier current in a spin-valve structure {{consisting of a}} semiconductor quantum wire flanked by half-metallic ferromagnetic contacts. The current decays because of D'yakonov-Perel' spin relaxation in the semiconductor caused by Rashba spin orbit interaction. The associated relaxation length is found to decrease with increasing lattice temperature (in the range 30 - 77 K) and exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on the electric field driving the current. The relaxation lengths are several tens of microns which are at least {{an order of magnitude}} larger than what has been theoretically calculated for two-dimensional structures at comparable temperatures, Rashba interaction strengths and electric fields.

40|$|The {{perovskite}} oxynitride LaTiO 2 N is {{a promising}} material for photocatalytic water splitting under visible light. One {{of the obstacles}} towards higher efficiencies of this and similar materials stems from charge-carrier recombination, which could be suppressed by the built-in electric field in polar materials. In this study, we investigate the spontaneous polarization in epitaxially strained LaTiO 2 N thin films via density functional theory calculations. The effect of epitaxial strain on the anion order, resulting out-of-plane polarization, energy barriers for polarization reversal and the corresponding coercive fields are studied.

40|$|Under ambient conditions, bismuth {{and related}} {{semimetal}} antimony adopt a distorted simple cubic crystal structure {{due to a}} Peierls distortion. Electronic excitation reduces the lattice distortion, and according to theory, the distortion can be removed completely with strong optical excitation, creating a transient high-symmetry cubic crystalline phase. The necessary light intensity exceeds the threshold for unwanted crystalline damage, preventing so far observation of such a transient phase through conventional time-resolved spectroscopy. Using a single-shot real-time measurement method, we demonstrate {{for the first time}} the photoinduced phase transition to the high-symmetry crystalline state of bismuth. We observe the generation of extremely large amplitude coherent phonon motion on the order of the lattice distortion in bulk bismuth, and strong damping in the phonon mode as the material approaches the symmetric phase. At low temperature, this results in the formation of the symmetric phase at high incident laser fluence.
