25|$|Every day {{she begged}} {{to be able}} to enter a temple and become a nun instead of marrying. Her father {{eventually}} allowed her to work in the temple, but asked the monks to give her the toughest chores in order to discourage her. The monks forced Miaoshan to work all day and all night while others slept in order to finish her work. However, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a good person that the animals living around the temple began to help her with her chores. Her father, seeing this, became so frustrated that he attempted to burn down the temple. Miaoshan put out the fire with her bare hands and suffered no burns. Now struck with fear, her father ordered her to be put to death.|$|E
25|$|Madhubala {{was quite}} another matter. I {{knew she was}} very sick even before I married her. But a promise is a promise. So I kept my word and brought her home as my wife, even though I knew she was dying from a {{congenital}} heart problem. For 9 long years I nursed her. I watched her die before my own eyes. You can never understand what this means until you live through this yourself. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a beautiful woman and she died so painfully. She would rave and rant and scream in frustration. How can such an active person spend 9 long years bed-ridden? And I had to humour her all the time. That's what the doctor asked me to. That's what I did till her very last breath. I would laugh with her. I would cry with her.|$|E

500|$|Musical {{performances}} {{also received}} mixed reviews. Anthony Benigno of the Daily News gave [...] "Conjunction Junction" [...] a grade of [...] "A"; {{he noted that}} ordinarily he would have declined to review it due to its short length, but said [...] "what a glorious ten seconds it is". Benigno and Poniewozik criticized the sanitization of [...] "Forget You", but while the latter found it inferior to the original version, the former preferred Paltrow's deeper voice and graded the song [...] "A". Rolling Stone Erica Futterman felt the censorship of the song did not adversely affect its success, and deemed Paltrow's rendition [...] "charming and sassy". Megan Vick of Billboard called it [...] "the most exciting number" [...] of the episode, and Stack went further in his praise: he bestowed a grade of [...] "A+" [...] and lauded it as [...] "one {{of the most memorable}} and energetic Glee performances ever, thanks in no small part to Paltrow". Green told MTV that he was flattered by the cover, particularly as he was not aware Paltrow would perform it when granting Glee clearance. He called her performance [...] "great", and commented that he had not been aware <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> an accomplished vocalist.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{describes}} Lena Horne as {{a profound}} inspiration, for entertainers of several generations {{as well as}} herself. Upon Horne's death, she stated [...] " [...] brought much joy into everyone's lives—even the younger generations, younger than myself. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a great talent. She opened up such doors for artists like myself." [...] Similarly, she considers Dorothy Dandridge {{to be one of}} her idols. Jackson has declared herself [...] "a very big Joni Mitchell fan", explaining [...] "As a kid I was drawn to Joni Mitchell records [...] Joni's songs spoke to me in an intimate, personal way." [...] She holds reverence for Tina Turner, stating [...] "Tina has become a heroic figure for many people, especially women, because of her tremendous strength. Personally, Tina doesn't seem to have a beginning or an end in my life. I felt her music was always there, and I feel like it always will be." [...] She has also named other socially conscious acts, such as Tracy Chapman, Sly and the Family Stone, U2, and Bob Dylan as sources of inspiration. In her early career, Jackson credited her brothers Michael and Jermaine as musical influences.

It's 27 years later. And I have to say, I love Lydia Deetz so much. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a huge part of me. I would be really interested in what she is doing 27 years later." [...] Ryder confirmed that she would only consider making a sequel if Burton and Keaton were involved. In December 2014, Burton stated, [...] "It's a character that I love and I miss actually working with Michael. There's only one Betelgeuse. We're working on a script and I think it's probably closer than ever and I'd love to work with him again." [...] In January 2015, writer Grahame-Smith told Entertainment Weekly that the script was finished and that he and Burton intended to start filming Beetlejuice 2 {{by the end of the}} year, and that both Keaton and Ryder would return in their respective roles. In August 2015, on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Ryder confirmed she would be reprising her role in the sequel. In May 2016, Burton stated, [...] "It's something that I really would like to do in the right circumstances, but it's one of those films where it has to be right. It's not a kind of a movie that cries out , it's not the Beetlejuice trilogy. So it's something that if the elements are right—because I do love the character and Michael's amazing as that character, so yeah we'll see. But there's nothing concrete yet." ...|$|E

2500|$|The first {{eleven years}} of Indira's {{position}} {{as prime minister}} saw her evolving from the perception of party leaders to the one with iron resolve to split the party for her policy positions or {{to go to war}} with Pakistan to liberate Bangladesh.

And Patty Hearst, you {{standing}} {{there in front of}} the Symbionese Liberation Army flag with your legs spread. I was wondering: were you gettin' it every night from a black revolutionary man and his women? Or were you really dead? And now that you're on the run, what goes on in your mind? Your sisters they sit by the window. You know, your mama does sit and cry. And your daddy—well, you know what your daddy said Patty. You know what your daddy said, Patty?

2500|$|Welch {{did with}} Fox her first {{starring}} vehicle, the British Modesty Blaise-style spy movie Fathom (1967), filmed in Spain. Second unit director Peter Medak said Welch [...] "was {{at that time}} quite inexperienced, exactly {{like one of those}} American drum majorettes. But she tried very hard and went to see the rushes each day, gradually improving. 'Who's this dumb broad?' people used to say. But I said: 'You wait. I'll bet she makes it.' I liked her very much because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>such</b> a genuine person. And she had a beautiful body which always helps." [...] Welch said her role was [...] "a blown up Barbie doll." [...] Reviewing her performance, the Los Angeles Times film critic said that [...] "each new Raquel Welch picture brings further proof that when Maria Montez died they didn't break the mold.
