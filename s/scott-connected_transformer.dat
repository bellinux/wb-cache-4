40|$|In this paper, a new {{topology}} {{is developed}} for a three-phase four-wire (3 P 4 W) distribution system utilizing a scott-transformer supported three-legs VSIs based three-phase three-wire (3 P 3 W) Unified Power Quality Conditioner (UPQC). In this proposed topologythe neutral {{point of the}} star connected transformer, used for the connection of series active power filter (APF) of 3 P 3 W UPQC, is utilized as a fourth wire for 3 P 4 W distribution system. The <b>scott-connected</b> <b>transformer</b> is connected near the load to compensatethe neutral current that may flow toward the neutral point of the series transformer of series APF. For the mitigation of different power quality(PQ) problems a control technique based on the combination of unit template technique(UTT) and power balancetheory(PBT) {{is used for the}} control of UPQC. In this control scheme of UPQC, the current/voltage control is applied over the fundamental supply currents/voltages instead of fast changing APFs currents/voltages, there by reducing the computational delay and the required sensors. The performance of the proposed topology ofUPQC is analyzed through simulations results using MATLAB software with its Simulink and Power System Block set toolboxes...|$|E
