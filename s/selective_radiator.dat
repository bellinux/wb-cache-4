40|$|AbstractEnhanced cooling of {{surfaces}} by radiative {{heat loss}} through the 8 - 14 micron atmospheric window was investigated using commonly available materials. Zinc sulphide {{was found to}} be a durable substance suitable as a convection cover. With respect to polyethylene, the most commonly used proof-of-concept convection cover in research to date, ZnS is orders of magnitude stronger, impervious to damage by UV, effectively inert and in practical thicknesses is more transparent in the 8 – 14 micron waveband. Use of this window material with a previously proposed <b>selective</b> <b>radiator</b> material, a form of anodised aluminium that reflects radiation at wavelengths shorter than 8 microns allows for the economical production of an effective <b>selective</b> <b>radiator</b> system. Measurements were made on simple radiator plates and convection covers. The principal aim of this project was to identify a durable cover, rather than investigate or optimise a novel <b>selective</b> <b>radiator</b> surface...|$|E
40|$|Extra-atmospheric {{space is}} {{practically}} a pure sink of radiation, {{and can be}} used as a nonconventional energy source. Surfaces with an emissivity matched with the atmospheric (8 ÷ 13) µm transparency window interact with cold space when exposed to clear sky at night, and undergo a sizeable cooling effect. During the day the sky radiative temperature remains low, but solar radiation is so much larger that no cooling effect can be obtained : it is however possible to shade the radiating surface using selective covers which stop the solar radiation without preventing infrared emission. In this paper we describe the optical properties of some cheap plastic films for radiative cooling, and present a simple analysis of the net radiated power as a function of the optical properties of the <b>selective</b> <b>radiator</b> and cover...|$|E
40|$|Optimal {{radiator}} thermal emission spectra maximizing thermophotovoltaic (TPV) {{conversion efficiency}} and output power density are determined when temperature {{effects in the}} cell are considered. To do this, a framework is designed in which a TPV model that accounts for radiative, electrical and thermal losses is coupled with a genetic algorithm. The TPV device under study involves a spectrally <b>selective</b> <b>radiator</b> at a temperature of 2000 K, a gallium antimonide cell, and a cell thermal management system characterized by a fluid temperature and a heat transfer coefficient of 293 K and 600 Wm- 2 K- 1. It is shown that a maximum conversion efficiency of 38. 8 % is achievable with an emission spectrum that has emissivity of unity between 0. 719 eV and 0. 763 eV and zero elsewhere. This optimal spectrum {{is less than half}} of the width of those when thermal losses are neglected. A maximum output power density of 41708 Wm- 2 is achievable with a spectrum having emissivity values of unity between 0. 684 eV and 1. 082 eV and zero elsewhere when thermal losses are accounted for. These emission spectra are shown to greatly outperform blackbody and tungsten radiators, and could be obtained using artificial structures such as metamaterials or photonic crystals.

50|$|Using <b>selective</b> <b>radiators</b> with Si PVs {{is still}} a possibility. <b>Selective</b> <b>radiators</b> would {{eliminate}} high and low energy photons, reducing heat generated. Ideally, <b>selective</b> <b>radiators</b> would emit no radiation beyond the band edge of the PV converter, increasing conversion efficiency significantly. No efficient TPVs have been realized using Si PVs.|$|R

40|$|Spectral {{control is}} a key {{technology}} for thermophotovoltaic (TPV) direct energy conversion systems because only a fraction (typically less than 25 %) of the incident thermal radiation has energy exceeding the diode bandgap energy, E{sub g}, and can thus be converted to electricity. The goal for TPV spectral control in most applications is twofold: (1) Maximize TPV efficiency by minimizing transfer of low energy, below bandgap photons from the radiator to the TPV diode. (2) Maximize TPV surface power density by maximizing transfer of high energy, above bandgap photons from the radiator to the TPV diode. TPV spectral control options include: front surface filters (e. g. interference filters, plasma filters, interference/plasma tandem filters, and frequency selective surfaces), back surface reflectors, and wavelength <b>selective</b> <b>radiators.</b> System analysis shows that spectral performance dominates diode performance in any practical TPV system, and that low bandgap diodes enable both higher efficiency and power density when spectral control limitations are considered. Lockheed Martin has focused its efforts on front surface tandem filters which have achieved spectral efficiencies of {approx} 83 % for E{sub g} = 0. 52 eV and {approx} 76 % for E{sub g} = 0. 60 eV for a 950 C radiator temperature...|$|R
40|$|The renewed {{interest}} in thermophotovoltaic (TPV) energy conversion, based on recent progress in materials and photovoltaic (PV) cell technology, requires a new evaluation of the TPV efficiency and power density potential. In this paper, we address some important points in TPV system design. We proceed in three steps, analyzing 1) the thermodynamic limit, 2) an idealized, and 3) a realistic model, based on an extrapolation of {{the current state of}} technology. In a TPV system, the radiation converted to electricity is adapted to the spectral response of the PV cell. This can be achieved by different means, which are examined in detail. Broadband and selective radiators, and optical filters are considered. We focus on combustion driven systems using low bandgap GaSb PV cells. For a system containing GaSb cells and a radiator at 1500 K, we find a thermodynamic limit efficiency of 60. 5 % and an output power density of 3 W/cm(2). For an idealized system model, an efficiency of 34 % and a power density of 2. 2 W/cm(2) are determined. For a realistic system with a broadband radiator and a filter, 9 % and 1. 2 W/cm(2) are estimated; using a <b>selective</b> <b>radiator</b> without filter, 16 % and 1 W/cm(2) are expected. Performance values of this order should be achievable with a sufficient development effort...|$|E
