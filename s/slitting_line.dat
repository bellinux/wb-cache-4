40|$|Duroc Special Steel is a {{so called}} {{re-roller}} operation and is located within SSAB:s industrial area in Luleå. The production includes rolling, annealing and slitting of warm and cold rolled metal strips in customized sizes. Along with 17 other companies Duroc Special Steel represents the Duroc group. The company has recently {{found that the}} slitting lines set up time is far too long considering {{the current state of}} production. In some cases the <b>slitting</b> <b>line</b> becomes a bottleneck operation. This occurs when the employees do not have enough time to finish a set up before the new product is ready to be produced. Therefore a study is needed to examine {{what can be done to}} shorten the set up time and also improve the building operation of the slitting tools, which is the main part of the set work. As a result, this thesis has been developed based on these two main problems; set up time and building slitting tools. The goal of this master thesis is therefore to demonstrate the ability to shorten set up times, improve set work and its work practices and also give solutions as to how this can be accomplished. The project’s primary implementation is based on a literature study consisting mainly of the SMED method, but also set up time and workers participation. Additionally during the project SMED has been the prinicipal tool for the task at hand and has therefore had a significant role in the work. Workers participation, in the form of completed workshops, has also been of great importance to the project. The literature study was used to anchor the implementation of the project and its ideas to achieve a result with credibility. A specification of demands was made containing criteria of what the solutions would bring and result in. It was later used in the project’s final stage to evaluate the different solutions and ideas. The problem solving of this master thesis has resulted in several proposals of what can be done to shorten the set up time, reduce the risk of bottleneck operations, improve set work and the building of the slitting tools. These proposed solutions shows both time and financial savings for the company and also the percentage of improval compared to the current set up time. Therefore the proposed solutions shows tangible improvements of 6 % to the set up time and also up to 40 % and 55 %, respectively, in case of slitting and packaging becoming bottleneck operations. Duroc Special Steel is recommended to gradually implement these proposed solutions in order to reduce set up time, improve set work and its work practices. Validerat; 20110323 (anonymous...|$|E

5000|$|There {{has been}} a great deal of {{speculation}} as to what the carcass could have been in life. Some, such as paleontologist Darren Naish, question whether the carcass ever existed in the first place. Naish expresses doubt that the carcass was real, and finds it suspicious that no sample was taken. Cryptozoologist Chris Orrick proposed that it was a severely mangled Shepherd's Beaked Whale that was twisted so that the dorsal fin and genital <b>slit</b> <b>lined</b> up, giving the appearance of a torn off limb. Loren Coleman and Patrick Huyghe speculated that it may be an unknown form of Beaked Whale. Another common suggestion is that the carcass is some sort of surviving prehistoric reptile. Shuker proposed initially that it was either a pliosaur or a thalattosuchian crocodile, but later referred to it as [...] "the last of the mosasaurs." [...] A 2006 expedition by the Centre for Fortean Zoology failed to uncover any remains of the creature at the alleged burial site.

40|$|Shear cutting {{is common}} within several sheet metal {{industry}} processing steps, e. g. in {{cut to length}} <b>lines,</b> <b>slitting</b> <b>lines,</b> end cropping. Shearing is fast and cheap relative to competing cutting methods like laser and plasma cutting, but involves large forces on the equipment that increase with increased sheet material strength. Accurate shear experiments are a prerequisite to increase the knowledge of shearing parameters, improve industrial shearing, and provide data for validation of numerical shear models. Here, the two shear parameters clearance and clamp configuration, identified {{as important to the}} shear results, were studied in an experimental set-up with well defined tool movement and high measurability of tool position and force. In addition to force measurements, the sheared edge geometry was characterized. Steels of low, medium, and high strength were selected for the study. Throughout the experimental study, the shear tool penetration before fracture decreased with increased material strength. The required shear force decreased and the force attempting to separate the two shear tools increased when one side of the sheet was left unclamped and free to move. Further, the maximum shear force increased with decreased clearance. Clearance changes were small and moreover continuously measured during all shear experiments...|$|R

40|$|The Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) {{fitted to}} modern {{passenger}} vehicles {{is intended to}} provide reliable and efficient braking under critical road conditions or in an emergency. However, the braking dynamics of a vehicle vary greatly depending on the road surface. On an unsealed road surface an ABS equipped vehicle will behave quite differently from vehicles without ABS. The braking distance on gravel or snow covered roads is less for systems without ABS. In this situation a snow or gravel wedge is responsible for an additional braking effect with locked wheels. In an ABS system, {{the formation of the}} wedge results in the unlocking of the brakes and the vehicle rolls over the wedge.

The specifically developed algorithm is used to analyse laser digital data that identifies the build-up of snow/gravel in front of the wheel in the form of a triangular wedge.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the current work was to measure two-dimensional maps of sodium velocities on the Mercury surface and examine the maps for evidence of sources or sinks of sodium on the surface. The McMath-Pierce Solar Telescope and the Stellar Spectrograph were used to measure Mercury spectra that were sampled at 7 milliAngstrom intervals. Observations were made each day during the period October 5 - 9, 2010. The dawn terminator was in view during that time. The velocity shift of the centroid of the Mercury emission line was measured relative to the solar sodium Fraunhofer line corrected for radial velocity of the Earth. The difference between the observed and calculated velocity shift was taken to be the velocity vector of the sodium relative to Earth.

40|$|Shearing is {{the process}} where sheet metal is {{mechanically}} cut between two tools. Various shearing technologies are commonly used in the sheet metal industry, for example, in cut to length <b>lines,</b> <b>slitting</b> <b>lines,</b> end cropping etc. Shearing has speed and cost advantages over competing cutting methods like laser and plasma cutting, but involves large forces on the equipment and large strains in the sheet material. The constant development of sheet metals toward higher strength and formability leads to increased forces on the shearing equipment and tools. Shearing of new sheet materials imply new suitable shearing parameters. Investigations of the shearing parameters through live tests in the production are expensive and separate experiments are time consuming and requires specialized equipment. Studies involving {{a large number of}} parameters and coupled effects are therefore preferably performed by finite element based simulations. Accurate experimental data is still a prerequisite to validate such simulations. There is, however, a shortage of accurate experimental data to validate such simulations. In industrial shearing processes, measured forces are always larger than the actual forces acting on the sheet, due to friction losses. Shearing also generates a force that attempts to separate the two tools with changed shearing conditions through increased clearance between the tools as result. Tool clearance is also the most common shearing parameter to adjust, depending on material grade and sheet thickness, to moderate the required force and to control the final sheared edge geometry. In this work, an experimental procedure that provides a stable tool clearance together with accurate measurements of tool forces and tool displacements, was designed, built and evaluated. Important shearing parameters and demands on the experimental set-up were identified in a sensitivity analysis performed with finite element simulations under the assumption of plane strain. With respect to large tool clearance stability and accurate force measurements, a symmetric experiment with two simultaneous shears and internal balancing of forces attempting to separate the tools was constructed. Steel sheets of different strength levels were sheared using the above mentioned experimental set-up, with various tool clearances, sheet clamping and rake angles. Results showed that tool penetration before fracture decreased with increased material strength. When one side of the sheet was left unclamped and free to move, the required shearing force decreased but instead the force attempting to separate the two tools increased. Further, the maximum shearing force decreased and the rollover increased with increased tool clearance. Digital image correlation was applied to measure strains on the sheet surface. The obtained strain fields, together with a material model, were used to compute the stress state in the sheet. A comparison, up to crack initiation, of these experimental results with corresponding results from finite element simulations in three dimensions and at a plane strain approximation showed that effective strains on the surface are representative also for the bulk material. A simple model was successfully applied to calculate the tool forces in shearing with angled tools from forces measured with parallel tools. These results suggest that, with respect to tool forces, a plane strain approximation is valid also at angled tools, at least for small rake angles. In general terms, this study provide a stable symmetric experimental set-up with internal balancing of lateral forces, for accurate measurements of tool forces, tool displacements, and sheet deformations, to study the effects of important shearing parameters. The results give further insight to the strain and stress conditions at crack initiation during shearing, and {{can also be used to}} validate models of the shearing process...|$|R
