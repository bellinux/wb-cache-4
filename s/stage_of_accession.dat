40|$|As {{part of the}} {{international}} presence in the Western Balkans, the European Union has adopted sanctions, brokered political agreements, launched its first-ever police and military missions and directed economic, legal and administrative reforms to eradicate {{the root causes of}} instability. Yet, despite the comprehensive nature of its involvement, the EU’s strategies have been marked by confusion, its actions by concurrent or competing mandates of other international organisations. As a result, the returns on its investments are dwindling, at a time when nation-building in the region has entered its final stages with the separation of Serbia and Montenegro, the search for bringing an end to {{the international}} governance of Bosnia-Herzegovina and a final status for Kosovo. As the Western Balkans still contain a genuine security threat, there is a real imperative now to move the region as a whole from the stage of international protectorates and weak states to the <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> <b>accession</b> to the euro-atlantic organisations to which they aspire. This book presents legal and political ways and means to restructure the international effort to see the defining processes through. Under the leadership of the EU, only a ‘tough love’ strategy based on a firm but fair application of the conditionality principle can lead to the integration of the Western Balkans into the European mainstream.

40|$|The author {{argues that}} the high real {{interest}} rate policy persued in the Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC) carries a risk of currency devaluation and recession when they join the European Monetary Union. Fear of demand-pull inflation has led the monetary authorities in the fast-growing CEEC to reduce the demand for credit by raising real interest rates, exceeding the interest parity relation with major EU markets. This policy has caused speculative capital inflows, distortion of capital allocation, real currency appreciation and trade deficits. Currency overvaluation will require a corrective devaluation via-a-vis the Euro during the final <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>accession</b> to the EMU. Such a "last minute" correction is likely to destabilize CEEC banks and businesses by upsetting the balance between short-term foreign currency liabilities and long-term domestic assets. The author proposes that the CEEC EMU candidates adopt flexible inflation targeting {{instead of focusing on}} interest rates as a main disinflationary tool. This would assure accumulation of the proper amount of foreign currency reserves, reduce the current account deficit and ensure a smooth transition to the EMU. The new policy should be focused on defining and adopting a band of acceptable inflation rate targets and a "step down" path to alignment with the Euro. ...|$|R

40|$|When {{institutions}} that decrease uncertainty are thin {{on the ground}} at home, can countries import them from abroad, through membership in stable and prosperous organizations such as the European Union? I show that EU accession has effects that cut both ways: investor risk decreases for candidate coun-tries, where uncertainty is high, and increases for existing, more secure members. I investigate how three rounds of EU expansion over the past 25 years have impacted yields on German treasury bills as well as on sovereign spreads in candidate countries. I compare those with the expansion of signatories to the Exchange Rate Mechanism and later the Euro. I find that investor risk all <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>accession</b> past application, while the number of entrants to EU institutions — particularly at the negotiations and membership stages — is associated with increases in Germany’s perceived default risk. This study has implications for institutional design: as rich-country clubs become more inclusive and adjust to the demands of newer and less-developed members, their own credibility weakens in important ways. NB: This is a combination of two papers/chapters that I’m working on, with probably too much foot-noting on other work that I’m doing at the same time.

40|$|Since its {{institutional}} {{birth in}} 1947, the GATT/WTO (WTO) has mushroomed from twenty-three original contracting parties {{to one hundred}} and fifty seven members as of September 2012.

According {{to the rules of}} the European structural funds the European financial means can only be used, if the CEE applicants have their own regional policy which must be compatible to the regulations of the EU structural funds. The European Commission still criticises in its progress reports a number of deficits with respect to the formation of the regional policies in the applicant countries. From the Commission’s viewpoint the deficits are seen particularly within the administrative area. The contribution deals itself not only with the administrative aspects, but above all with the conceptional arrangements of the regional policies in the applicant countries. It is investigated, how the CEE countries handle the area designation, whether there exists a regional policy strategy and what kind of strategy (growth vs. equalisation) will be preferred and whether there have been designed policy instruments being suitable to implement the regional policy strategy and what types of instruments are designated to be used. The outlined questions have played an important role {{since the beginning of the}} 90 ''''s also in Germany, when the new German Länder were integrated into the German and European regional policy. Therefore the East German experiences of developing a regional policy which corresponds to the existing regional problems are also included into the contribution. The contribution is based on the analysis of literature and documents about the regional policy in CEE countries and in the new German Länder as well as of documents of the EU, in which the regional policy of CEE applicant countries is analysed and evaluated. ...|$|R

40|$|From the Introduction]. So far, {{questions}} {{of compliance with}} EU rules in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) have mainly been addressed from the somewhat broader perspective of the "Europeanization of Central and Eastern Europe" (Schimmelfennig/Sedelmeier 2005 b; see also Grabbe 2003; Glenn 2003; for the field of social policy and social dialogue cf. Sissenich 2003). 5 Few studies, however, have yet taken into account the more recent developments of the "final spurt" towards 1 May 2004, 6 and a systematic comparison between {{the old and the}} new member states is rarely, or only implicitly provided. This paper contributes to this discussion by directly comparing the implementation of six selected EU social policy Directives in Poland to implementation (problems) of the same Directives in the EU- 15. 7 Two questions will be analyzed: (1) How does Poland perform, (2) and which factors impeded implementation compared to the EU 15 ? Thus, on the one hand the paper aims at enriching the theoretical debate on compliance with supranational rules. On the other hand, by choosing this field, implications of "Social Europe" for Poland shall be discussed as well. Which adaptation requirements have been necessary in Poland compared to the EU- 15 ? Were the existing national standards already close to or even above European standards, or was it necessary to carry out far-reaching changes? When did adaptations take place (e. g. anticipatory or rather at short notice before accession), and what is the role of EU social policy in Poland regarding the prevention of "social dumping" within the EU? In contrast to existing expectations, this paper will show striking similarities between Poland and the EU- 15 with regards to the implementation requirements and resulting outcomes in this field. After giving an overview of the state of the art in compliance research "West" (section 2), the paper will analyze the effects of the six Directives in Poland at the <b>stages</b> <b>of</b> <b>accession</b> negotiation, formal transposition, as well as (to a more limited degree) application and enforcement (section 3). The comparison to the EU- 15 is drawn within each section summary. Finally, section 4 sums up and discusses the results with an outlook on the European Union after 1 May 2004...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the evolution of}} Poland's party-political consensus on accession to the European Union, starting with the elections to the contract parliament in June 1989 and ending with the accession referendum in June 2003. The main finding is that the establishment of consensus in favour <b>of</b> <b>accession</b> among Poland's political elites proved much more challenging than the elites' declarations of support suggest. Although most parties declared support for accession, throughout the entire pre-accession period they also supported policy proposals that contradicted accession conditions. The EU's strict neoliberal economic requirements and the loss <b>of</b> national sovereignty <b>accession</b> entailed proved particularly challenging. Rather than reconcile their policy proposals with EU's conditions, or change their stance on accession, parties rhetorically re-presented the EU into different visions that aligned with their ideological offering. Declarations of support for 'Social Europe', 'Christian Europe' or the 'Europe of Nations' gave the appearance of consensus. But in fact no in-depth consensus was possible since {{the way in which}} political groupings presented the 'Europe' they claimed to support was so different as to remove a common denominator they could agree on. As a result, the single biggest change Polish society experienced since 1989 was never really addressed in political debate. The integration project was propelled forward not by in-depth political consensus but by a series of rhetorical compromises. At each <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> the <b>accession</b> process the parties' inability to negotiate more than a nominal consensus prevented meaningful public debate. During each electoral contest of the pre-accession period voters were presented with ambiguous rhetoric in place of alternative policy options that would have enabled the electorate to hold decision makers to account...|$|R

40|$|In 2011 Croatia {{entered the}} final <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> its <b>accession</b> {{negotiations}} with the EU. The completion of these negotiations will probably coincide with the parliamentary elections which should be held in November or December this year. The elections are likely {{to bring about a}} change of government, as public support for Jadranka Kosor's cabinet and her party, the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) has been declining; the left-wing opposition is likely to take power. Therefore, the government’s main goal is to complete the accession negotiations {{in the first half of}} the year, in order to sign the accession treaty and hold the EU membership referendum before the parliamentary elections. The HDZ believes that only the successful completion <b>of</b> the <b>accession</b> negotiations could increase its chances of a good result in the upcoming elections. At the same time, fearing a further fall in support, the government will avoid any decisions and reforms that would be controversial for the public, especially in the sphere of the economy; such decisions could also increase Euroscepticism among the Croatian public, and result in the rejection <b>of</b> EU <b>accession</b> in the referendum. The government in Zagreb hopes that the currently implemented anti-corruption strategy and reform of the judiciary, as well as the advanced process of adaptation to EU conditions, will be enough to complete the negotiations. This strategy has a serious chance of success, considering that there is considerable support for Croatia's membership among the EU countries and institutions. Another reason is that further prolongation of the negotiations could aggravate hostility towards the EU among the Croatian public, and would be a bad sign for other Balkan states with membership aspirations. However, subordinating Croatian policies to the completion of negotiations in the first half of the year could prove to be adverse for Croatia itself in the longer term, as it would put off the necessary structural reforms...|$|R
40|$|Having in {{mind that}} many professions in modern {{business}} conditions abound in introduction of the code of ethics, International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) has prepared the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants.

The characteristics of jujube fruit polysaccharides from an accession known as P 3 were determined {{for each of}} the 5 ripening stages. Therefore, the content of the Alcohol Insoluble Materials, Water Soluble Polysaccharide and Galacturonic Acid was determined at each ripening <b>stage.</b> The degree <b>of</b> methylation (DM) of jujube pectins was less than 50 % therefore was classified as low methoxylated pectin (LM). Using the 3 rd and the 5 th ripening <b>stage,</b> the impact <b>of</b> the drying and cooking was evaluated on selected nutritional characteristics, including vitamin C, total phenolics content and antioxidant capacity. Remarkably, using the fruits from the 3 rd stage, the drying process decreased the vitamin C content (74. 5 %, p< 0. 05) whereas an increase of 20 % (p< 0. 05) was observed for the cake. Interestingly, the antioxidant activity was unchanged during the drying process. In contrast, after the cooking process the phenolics content and the antioxidant capacity had both increased, by 64 % and 30 % (p< 0. 05) respectively.
