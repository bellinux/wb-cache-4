50|$|Transmuxing (Transmux: Transcode Multiplexing) is a {{telecommunications}} signaling format change between two signaling methods, typically <b>synchronous</b> <b>optical</b> <b>network</b> signals, SONET, and various time-division multiplexing, TDM, signals. Transmuxing changes the “container” without changing the “contents.” Transmuxing provides the carrier {{the capability to}} embed {{a telecommunications}} signal from one logical TDM circuit to another within SONET without physically breaking down the TDM circuit into its components and reconstructing it. There {{are two types of}} Transmuxing - Electrical Transmuxing and Optical Transmuxing (sometimes called portless transmuxing). In Electrical Transmuxing, TDM signals (typically DS1/T1 or DS3) are brought in using copper connections, transmuxed to SONET and transported across the network until the reverse occurs. In Optical Transmuxing, TDM signals (DS1/T1, DS3, OCx) are brought in using fiber optics, transmuxed to SONET and transported across the network until the reverse occurs. In the U.S. and Japan, DS1/T1 signals are transmuxed into a SONET virtual tributary called a VT1.5.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} the edge-partition problem, {{which is a}} graph theoretic problem arising {{in the design of}} <b>Synchronous</b> <b>Optical</b> <b>Networks.</b> The deterministic edge-partition problem considers an undirected graph with weighted edges, and simultaneously assigns nodes and edges to subgraphs such that each edge appears in exactly one subgraph, and such that no edge is assigned to a subgraph unless both of its incident nodes are also assigned to that subgraph. Additionally, there are limitations on the number of nodes and on the sum of edge weights that can be assigned to each subgraph. In this paper, we consider a stochastic version of the edge-partition problem in which we assign nodes to subgraphs in a first stage, realize a set of edge weights from a finite set of alternatives, and then assign edges to subgraphs. We first prescribe a two-stage cutting plane approach with integer variables in both stages, and examine computational difficulties associated with the proposed cutting planes. As an alternative, we prescribe a hybrid integer programming/constraint programming algorithm capable of solving a suite of test instances within practical computational limits...|$|R
40|$|SONET (<b>Synchronous</b> <b>Optical</b> <b>NETworks)</b> {{add-drop}} multiplexers (ADMs) are {{the dominant}} cost {{factor in the}} WDM(Wavelength Division Multiplexing) /SONET rings. The number of SONET ADMs required {{by a set of}} traffic streams is determined by the routing and wavelength assignment of the traffic streams. Previous works took as input the traffic streams with routings given a priori and developed various heuristics for wavelength assignment to minimize the SONET ADM costs. However, little was known about the performance guarantees of these heuristics. This paper contributes mainly in two aspects. First, in addition to the traffic streams with pre-specified routing, this paper also studies minimizing the ADM requirement by traffic streams without given routings, a problem which is shown to be NP-hard. Several heuristics for integrated routing and wavelength assignment are proposed to minimize the SONET ADM costs. Second, the approximation ratios of those heuristics for wavelength assignment only and those heuristics for integrated routing and wavelength assignment are analyzed. The new Preprocessed Iterative Matching heuristic has the best approximation ratio: at most 3 / 2...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} examine aspects related to network {{synchronization}} distribution and the cascading of timing elements. Methods of timing distribution {{have become a}} much debated topic in standards forums and among network service providers (both domestically and internationally).

The particular choices for synchronization distribution network architectures are now being evaluated and are demonstrating that they can indeed have a profound effect on the overall service performance levels that will be delivered to the customer. The salient aspects of these concerns reduce to the following: (1) identifying that the devil is in the details of the timing element specifications and the distribution of timing information (i. e., small design choices can have a large performance impact); (2) developing a standardized method of performance verification that will yield unambiguous results; and (3) presentation of those results.

40|$|Abstract—In {{high-speed}} wavelength-division-multiplexed <b>synchronous</b> <b>optical</b> <b>network</b> (SONET) ring networks, {{the terminal}} equipment {{costs associated with}} electronic multiplexing can be predominantly high. Placing a wavelength add–drop multiplexer (WADM) at each network node allows certain wavelengths to optically bypass the node without being electronically terminated. This approach can effectively reduce the total equipment cost if connections and channels are appropriately assigned in traffic grooming. In this paper, we present a series of wavelength optimization and wavelength assignment algorithms with the objective to optimize the number of required SONET add–drop multiplexers and yet minimizes the number of wavelengths in both unidirectional and bidirectional rings under an arbitrary grooming factor. In our analysis, we have considered both uniform and general nonuniform all-to-all network traffic. As a simple model for realistic traffic patterns, a special case of nonuniform traffic, distance-dependent traffic, is analyzed in detail. Significant ADM savings are observed for different traffic scenarios using our proposed algorithms.

On these networks, we dealt with scheduling algorithm that maximizes the switch throughput. So far, previous literature works have formalized this scheduling problem as the finding of a maximum bipartite matching (MBM) in a convex graph. The MBM formalization has collected several follow-ups, mainly focused on measuring switch-level performance. We revise the MBM formalization by measuring network-level performance. Surprisingly, {{we find out that}} when optical switches are cascaded, MBM formalization has two not negligible lacks: i) a useless degradation of optical signal quality; ii) a tendency in shifting optical packets toward lower wavelengths, thus increasing the occurrence of wavelength contention. To solve these issues, we propose a novel formalization of the scheduling problem as the finding of a maximum bipartite matching with minimum edges weights (MW-MBM). We show that MW-MBM outperforms MBM in terms of both <b>network</b> throughput and <b>optical</b> signal to noise ratio.
