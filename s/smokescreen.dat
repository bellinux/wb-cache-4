5|$|Force B {{commenced}} its attack {{after the}} Tallboy Lancasters had completed theirs {{so that the}} shock waves from bomb explosions did not prematurely set off the JW mines. As none of the Force B aircrew were able to spot Tirpitz due to the <b>smokescreen,</b> they dropped the mines on the battleship's estimated position. These weapons did not cause any damage. The <b>smokescreen</b> over Kaafjord prevented the Allied aircrew {{from being able to}} assess the results of their bombing, though several large spouts of water and explosions were observed. Tait was also pleased to see a column of black smoke rising through the <b>smokescreen.</b> However, some of the bombs and mines landed up to a mile from the battleship. Tirpitzs anti-aircraft guns and a further 98 guns located in nearby shore batteries and warships fired on the bombers throughout the attack. However, only four Lancasters suffered any damage.|$|E
5|$|As the German ships {{approached}} Glorious, Acasta, {{which had}} been trying to maintain the <b>smokescreen,</b> broke through her own smoke and fired two volleys of torpedoes at Scharnhorst. One of these hit the battleship at 17:34 abreast her rear turret and badly damaged her. Acasta also managed one hit from her 4.7-inch guns on Scharnhorst, but was riddled by German gunfire and sank at around 18:20.|$|E
5|$|In Queensland, P. fimbriata is {{reluctant}} {{to jump into the}} webs of prey spiders, while other Portia species do this at any opportunity. The Queensland orb web spider Argiope appensa shakes its web violently to shake off intruders, and P. fimbriata finds a detour that allows it to abseil on to the prey. When the web spider Zosis genicularis is busy wrapping up its own prey and is less aware of other predators, P. fimbriata uses this activity as a type of <b>smokescreen</b> to approach the web spider.|$|E

25|$|On 3 April 1945, Würzburg was {{occupied}} by the U.S. 12th Armored Division and U.S. 42nd Infantry Division {{in a series of}} frontal assaults masked by <b>smokescreens.</b> The battle continued until the final Wehrmacht resistance was defeated on 5 April 1945.|$|R
5|$|Kaafjord's {{defenders}} {{detected the}} Lancasters approximately {{ten minutes before}} they arrived, and the protective <b>smokescreen</b> was beginning to form when the attack commenced at 10:55am GMT. Only {{the first group of}} Lancasters, led by Tait, were able to aim their bombs at Tirpitz before she was obscured by smoke. It is believed that the bomb dropped from Tait's aircraft struck the battleship, and the other bombs dropped by this group landed in the water nearby. All the other Force A aircraft aimed their Tallboys at the anti-aircraft gunfire rising from the ship; 17 of the weapons were dropped. Several Lancasters made more than one pass over the target area as their bomb aimers sought to locate Tirpitz or technical problems prevented their Tallboy from being dropped on the initial pass.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{returns to}} the railcar, seeing its door ajar; an alien-human test subject is locked in a room inside. The Red-Haired Man attacks Mulder, causing the {{conductor}} to lock them both in the car. The Red-Haired Man claims {{to work for the}} NSA, and that a bomb in the car was triggered after he gained entry with Zama's pass code. Mulder doesn't believe him, but he is called by Scully on the Red-Haired Man's cell phone. Scully—who is with the First Elder in a similar railcar—tells Mulder that unwitting subjects, including herself, were operated on by Zama in the secret railway, with the alien abduction theory used as a <b>smokescreen.</b> She also confirms that a bomb is in the car and believes that the quarantined patient is infected with hemorrhagic fever. She fears that thousands will die from the disease if the car explodes. Mulder finds the bomb in the ceiling.|$|E
5|$|The ramparts of Le Quesnoy clearly made {{a frontal}} attack {{undesirable}} and artillery {{could not be}} used on the town, due to the presence of the civilian population. Instead, it was intended that under the cover of a <b>smokescreen,</b> the town be enveloped from the north and south, thereby encircling it. Two New Zealand brigades were to be involved; Hart's Rifle Brigade was tasked with the capture of the town, while the 1st Infantry Brigade, under the command of Brigadier General Charles Melvill, was to push into the Mormal Forest. The division's flanks were held by the 62nd Division and the 37th Division, on the left and right respectively and these formations were to make corresponding movements forward.|$|E
50|$|The {{main feature}} of the game was combat {{involving}} customized vehicles. The vehicle construction portion of the game allowed a variety of power plants, guns, ammunition, mine-layers, <b>smokescreens,</b> oil slicks and rockets to be arranged onto an even larger selection of body and chassis types.|$|R
50|$|Dr. Blodgett {{was issued}} eight U.S. patents during her career. She {{was the sole}} {{inventor}} on {{all but two of}} the patents, working with Vincent J. Schaefer as co-inventor.

5|$|Tirpitz {{anchorage}} at Kaafjord {{was protected}} by anti-aircraft batteries and fighter aircraft. At the time of Operation Tungsten, four batteries of heavy anti-aircraft guns and seven batteries of light guns were located on the shore near the battleship. Several anti-aircraft vessels and destroyers were also usually moored near Tirpitz. The battleship herself was fitted with 68 anti-aircraft guns. Equipment capable of generating an artificial <b>smokescreen</b> to hide Tirpitz from aircraft had also been installed around Kaafjord. The German Air Force (Luftwaffe) had {{only a small number}} of fighters stationed at bases near Kaafjord, and their operations were constrained by a lack of fuel. British intelligence believed that the German fighter force in the area could be rapidly expanded in the event of an emergency. The Luftwaffe typically conducted three reconnaissance flights into the Arctic Sea each day.|$|E
5|$|In {{the eastern}} Mediterranean, the decoy {{operation}} MG 3 had begun when convoy MW12 with three freighters had sailed from Port Said after dusk on 10 August. The merchant ships were escorted by two cruisers, ten destroyers and two smaller escorts and another merchant ship escorted by two cruisers and three destroyers left Haifa at 03:00 the next day. The two forces rendezvoused early on 11 August and sailed {{west to the}} longitude of Alexandria, then turned back. U-83 had reported that four cruisers and ten destroyers were close to Crete and a message from a Sunderland was intercepted. Reconnaissance reports from Malta noted a <b>smokescreen</b> over Valletta, apparently to conceal two cruisers but this was later taken to mean that the British were hiding the departure of ships heading west towards the convoy. The large size of the convoy was interpreted by Supermarina to imply an operation in the eastern Mediterranean and prepared to reinforce the 8th Cruiser Division at Navarino.|$|E
5|$|Langsdorff {{thought the}} two light cruisers {{were making a}} torpedo attack, and turned away under a <b>smokescreen.</b> The respite allowed Exeter to {{withdraw}} from the action; by now, only one of her gun turrets was still in action, and she had suffered 61 dead and 23 wounded crew members. At around 07:00, Exeter returned to the engagement, firing from her stern turret. Admiral Graf Spee fired on her again, scored more hits, and forced Exeter to withdraw again, this time with a list to port. At 07:25, Admiral Graf Spee scored a hit on Ajax that disabled her aft turrets. Both sides broke off the action, Admiral Graf Spee retreating into the River Plate estuary, while Harwood's battered cruisers remained outside to observe any possible breakout attempts. In the course of the engagement, Admiral Graf Spee had been hit approximately 70 times; 36 men were killed and 60 more were wounded, including Langsdorff, who had been wounded twice by splinters while standing on the open bridge.|$|E
50|$|Artillery and mortars {{can also}} fire smoke {{generating}} munitions, {{and are the}} main means of generating tactical <b>smokescreens</b> on land. As with grenades, artillery shells are available as both emission type smoke shell, and bursting smoke shell. Mortars nearly always use bursting smoke rounds because of the smaller size of mortar bombs and the greater efficiency of bursting rounds.|$|R
5000|$|Bainimarama {{also accused}} Tora of using <b>smokescreens</b> to deceive the people. [...] "Senator Tora is using land and {{fisheries}} issues {{to stir up}} emotions in the people ...

5|$|Motivated {{in part by}} {{a desire}} to prove that Australians could compete at the highest level, and believing that claims that his brother died due to {{inexperience}} was a <b>smokescreen</b> intended to cover-up the poor safety standards, Malcolm Milne represented Australia at the next two Winter Olympics, won a World Cup event and came third in a World Championship. In 1968, Milne finished 24th in both the downhill and slalom events, Australia's best result in a skiing event up to that point. Ross Martin came 60th in both cross-country events, and Colin Coates came 41st and 49th in his two speed skating events. Australia had more officials present than athletes, with five competitors and three administrators. This trend continued at the 1972 Olympics in Sapporo, which were attended by five staff and four athletes. Milne rose up the rankings to finish 23rd and 24th in the downhill and slalom respectively, as did Coates, who came in the top 30 in three of his four events, including an 18th-place result in the 10,000m event. Milne was considered a medal contender and the team manager felt that but for a near-fall, he would have placed near the medalists.|$|E
5|$|Following Operation Tungsten, British {{intelligence}} assessed that Tirpitz {{would be}} repaired within six months. Accordingly, Cunningham directed Fraser on 13 April to launch another {{attack on the}} battleship. While Cunningham {{did not believe that}} Barracudas could carry weapons capable of sinking Tirpitz, he hoped that further air strikes would increase the period the battleship was out of service and harm her crew's morale. Fraser initially resisted Cunningham's order, arguing that the prospects for a successful raid were poor as the Germans would have reinforced the defences around Tirpitz and weather conditions were likely to be worse than those encountered during Operation Tungsten. He eventually relented, and Moore sailed from Scapa Flow on 21 April to attack Kaafjord again. This raid, designated Operation Planet, was called off on 24 April due to bad weather over the target area. Two other attacks, Operation Brawn and Operation Tiger Claw, also had to be cancelled on 15 and 28 May respectively because of adverse weather. Further carrier raids were attempted in July and August after Allied intelligence determined that the repairs to Tirpitz were nearing completion. During Operation Mascot a force of 42 Barracudas and 40 fighters attacked Tirpitz on 17 July, but did not score any hits as the battleship was hidden by a <b>smokescreen.</b> A further four carrier raids were conducted against Kaafjord between 22 and 29 August during Operation Goodwood, but these caused only light damage to the battleship.|$|E
5|$|Royal Air Force (RAF) heavy bombers {{conducted}} {{a series of}} unsuccessful raids on Tirpitz shortly after the battleship arrived in Norway from Germany in January 1942. Tirpitz was initially based at Fættenfjord near Trondheim, which lay within range of British bombers flying from Scotland. The first raid took place on 30 January, and involved nine Handley Page Halifax and seven Short Stirling bombers. Due to cloud over the target area, only one of the bombers sighted Tirpitz and none inflicted any damage. One Halifax crashed into the sea on its way back to Scotland, but its crew were rescued. The next raid on Fættenfjord took place on 30 March, with the attacking force comprising 33 Halifaxes. The operation was again frustrated by heavy clouds over the target area. Four of the Halifaxes were shot down, and two others crashed while returning to base. Another attack was mounted by 30 Halifaxes and 11 Avro Lancasters on the night of 27/28 April. Tirpitz was located and attacked by the aircraft of the first wave, but no damage was inflicted and five heavy bombers were lost. The final raid in this series took place the next night, and involved 21 Halifaxes and 12 Lancasters. The attackers found Tirpitz covered in a protective <b>smokescreen,</b> and the battleship again escaped damage; two British aircraft were destroyed.|$|E
50|$|On 11 July 1995 the Bratunac Light Infantry Brigade, {{reinforced}} by a unit from the Vlasenica Light Infantry Brigade, began a final push into Srebrenica from the Southeast. At 1430 the two F-16s conducted {{air strikes against}} VRS tanks, inflicting some damage during the thirty-minute attack, to which Mladić responded by ordering ground troops to take air attack defense measures, such as the burning of haystacks to create <b>smokescreens.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Goodhue rejoined her {{transport}} squadron 10 April. She transferred her Army Medical Detachment to Ie Shima by [...] April {{and landed}} {{the main body}} of her embarked troops 20 April. Nearing the beaches in a predawn operation, she landed her reinforcements and retired, undergoing air attack again that afternoon. Cargo was off loaded under cover of <b>smokescreens</b> by 24 April and 2 days later Goodhue joined a convoy bound for Ulithi.|$|R
5000|$|The first 6 in salvoes {{from the}} Allied cruisers were fired at 18:30 at the {{surprised}} Italian flotilla {{at a range}} of 18000 yd. Baroni realised that—despite the best speed of his ships—they were hopelessly outgunned. He therefore decided to sacrifice Espero in order to enable the other two to escape: Espero laid <b>smokescreens</b> and conducted evasive manoeuvres. Zeffiro [...] and Ostro headed safely to the southwest at full speed.|$|R
25|$|The Satmar Hasidic {{community}} in particular denounces any geographic or political establishment of Israel, deeming this establishment has directly interfering with God's plan for Jewish redemption.

25|$|T-54-3 (Ob'yekt 137Sh) or T-54 Model 1951 – Produced 1952–1954, in Poland 1956–1964. Adopted the familiar, fully egg-shaped turret and new TSh-2-22 {{telescopic}} gunner's sight {{instead of}} the TSh-20. Also, early T-54's lacked a snorkel. The tank is also able to use its engine exhaust smoke system to create <b>smokescreen</b> by injecting vaporized diesel fuel onto the exhaust system. This feature was continued throughout the entire T-54/T-55 series and {{was used in the}} T-62 series.|$|E
25|$|Mulder's {{ultimate}} {{goal was to}} uncover what he {{believed to be a}} government conspiracy to hide the truth about alien life, and to find out what had happened to his sister. His quest and belief in the existence of aliens was, for most of the series, the driving force of the plot, or mytharc. However, during a period of time after Scully's cancer went into remission (season 5), Mulder was convinced by Michael Kritschgau that aliens did not in fact exist, and that the government conspirators had merely concocted that threat as a <b>smokescreen,</b> to justify military activities and toy with him.|$|E
5|$|The most {{noteworthy}} {{reaction of}} TiCl4 is its easy hydrolysis, signaled by {{the release of}} hydrogen chloride {{and the formation of}} titanium oxides and oxychlorides, as described above for the production of TiO2. Titanium tetrachloride has been used to create naval <b>smokescreens.</b> The hydrogen chloride immediately absorbs water to form an aerosol of hydrochloric acid that efficiently scatter light. In addition, the highly refractive titanium dioxide is also an efficient light scatterer. This smoke is however corrosive.|$|R
5000|$|On November 22, 2005, the Iraqi {{government}} stated {{it would}} investigate {{the use of}} white phosphorus {{in the battle of}} Fallujah. On November 30, 2005, General Peter Pace stated that white phosphorus munitions were a [...] "legitimate tool of the military" [...] used to illuminate targets and create <b>smokescreens,</b> saying [...] "It is not a chemical weapon. It is an incendiary. And it is well within the law of war to use those weapons as they're being used, for marking and for screening".|$|R
50|$|Battle of Havrincourt (12 September 1918). After a week's rest, and {{training}} in tank cooperation {{and the use of}} <b>smokescreens,</b> the battalion moved up to support the division's attack on Havrincourt. The following morning the 2/20th led the renewed attack, moving close behind the barrage and getting beyond their objectives, before repelling counter-attacks: divisional HQ described it as a 'clever and successful operation'. The battalion was relieved on 15 September, having suffered casualties of 4 officers and 35 other ranks killed, 10 other ranks wounded.|$|R
25|$|Brunswick seemed {{baffled by}} Hoche's clumsy attack on his army. In his {{subsequent}} actions the Prussian failed to fully cooperate with his colleague Wurmser. Despite its defeat, {{the morale of}} the Army of the Moselle was unaffected. The French soldiers remained sure of themselves, perhaps because of their capture of enemy-held territory before the battle. Hoche fortified Pirmasens and Blieskastel and mounted a false attack against Brunswick. But this was a <b>smokescreen</b> to cover his real intentions which were to shift his strength against Wurmser's western flank. Already on 23 November, Philippe-Joseph Jacob's division was moved to Niederbronn-les-Bains. This was joined by Taponier's division on 5 December and Jean Grangeret's division a week later. On 22 December 1793, Hoche defeated Wurmser in the Battle of Froeschwiller.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s a post-rave, DIY, free party scene had {{established}} {{itself in the}} UK. It was largely based around an alliance between warehouse party goers from various urban squat scenes and politically inspired new age travellers. The new agers offered a readymade network of countryside festivals that were hastily adopted by squatters and ravers alike. Prominent among the sound systems operating at this time were Exodus in Luton, Tonka in Brighton, <b>Smokescreen</b> in Sheffield, DiY in Nottingham, Bedlam, Circus Warp, LSDiesel and London's Spiral Tribe. The high point of this free party period came in May 1992 when with less than 24 hours notice and little publicity more than 35,000 gathered at the Castlemorton Common Festival for 5 days of partying.|$|E
25|$|Battlefield 2 maps have 3 {{variations}}, each {{suited for}} {{a certain number of}} players. Each map has 16, 32, and 64 player-suggested variations in which the area of battlefield or playing field is relatively small, medium, and large, respectively. The only exceptions to this are Wake Island 2007, which is locked at 64-player size and the Euro Force maps, Operation <b>Smokescreen,</b> Great Wall, and Taraba Quarry, which have no 64-player size. 32 and 64 player maps are unavailable to offline players from retailers, but an option is given to download 64 Single player AI bot mods. Other contrasts between these variations other than the size are the number and position of control points and availability of vehicles. As a result, the gameplay of the map is different depending on the variation.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of early {{examples}} of using incendiary weapons at sea, such as Greek fire, stinkpots, fire ships, and incendiaries on the decks of turtle ships, which also had the effect of creating smoke. The naval smoke screen is often said to have been proposed by Sir Thomas Cochrane in 1812, although Sir Cochrane's proposal was as much an asphyxiant as an obscurant. It is not until the early twentieth century that we get clear evidence of deliberate use of large scale naval <b>smokescreens</b> as a major tactic.|$|R
50|$|On {{the morning}} of 9 July most of the naval {{activity}} {{came to an end}} as Soviet boats withdrew, though the larger Soviet ships continued shelling the area. Finnish forces, reinforced by the German SAT Ost, armed with a single 152mm gun—heavier than any guns aboard the Soviet ships—attempted to drive them away, and the Soviet ships withdrew under cover of <b>smokescreens.</b> This proved to be the final surface action of the battle. During the morning the last Soviet pockets of resistance had been cleared from the island. There were several more Soviet aerial attacks, but no further landing attempts.|$|R
50|$|White {{phosphorus}} {{a highly}} efficient smoke producing agent, burning quickly and causing an instant bank of smoke. As a result, smoke-producing white phosphorus munitions are common, particularly as smoke grenades for infantry, loaded in defensive grenade dischargers on tanks and other armored vehicles, or {{as part of}} the ammunition allotment for artillery or mortars. These create <b>smokescreens</b> to mask movement from the enemy, or to mask his fire. As an incendiary weapon, WP burns fiercely and can set cloth, fuel, ammunition and other combustibles on fire. White phosphorus use is legal for purposes such as illumination and obscuring smoke, and the Chemical Weapons Convention does not list WP in its schedules of chemical weapons.|$|R
