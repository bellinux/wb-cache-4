40|$|Hypothesis / aims {{of study}} The use of mesh {{reinforcement}} in repair of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) with various surgical kits has become {{popular in the}} last few years, and its efficacy has been mainly proven to reduce recurrent cytocele (1). The current used kits are based on trocar assisted mesh positioning, inserting the trocars blindly through the obturator membrane or ischial fossa.

In order to overcome those serious complications, and to avoid blind trocar passage, Endofast Reliant system was developed for mesh attachment into soft tissue, using four soft-tissue <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>fasteners</b> (Fig. 1).

40|$|The {{solid rocket}} booster uses {{hydraulic}} pumps fabricated from cast C 355 aluminum alloy, with 17 - 4 PH <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> pump port caps.

In the past, pump port cap fasteners were installed to a torque of 33 Nm (300 in-lb). However, the structural analyses used a significantly higher nut factor than indicated during tests conducted by Boeing Space Systems. When the torque values were reassessed using Boeing's nut factor, the fastener preload had a factor of safety of less than 1, with potential for overloading the joint. This paper describes how behavior was determined for a preloaded joint with a steel bolt threaded into steel inserts in aluminum parts. Finite element models were compared with test results. For all initial bolt preloads, bolt loads increased as external applied loads increased. For higher initial bolt preloads, less load was transferred into the bolt, due to external applied loading. Lower torque limits were established for pump port cap fasteners and additional limits were placed on insert axial deformation under operating conditions after seating the insert with an initial preload...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis is to {{investigate}} the ductility and application of titanium alloys, like titanium 6 Al- 4 V, when used in aerospace fasteners compared to more conventional <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> aerospace <b>fasteners</b> such as A 286. There have been concerns raised about the safe usability of titanium 6 - 4 in the aerospace industry due to its lack of strain hardening. However, {{there is a lack}} of data pertaining to this concern of safe usage which this thesis aims to address. Tensile tests were conducted to find the ductility indexes of these fasteners which quantify the amount of plastic to elastic elongation. From the tests conducted it was found that the two materials yield and tensile strengths were very similar, though the ductility index of A 286 is on average ten times greater than that of titanium 6 - 4. This thesis includes joint diagram examples that analyze typical joints using both materials. It was found from joint diagram examples that the lower ductility index of the titanium alloy will only be detrimental to use at higher preloads. However, the titanium alloy can be used safely in place of A 286 in most loading situations just with narrower safety margins in these controlled examples...|$|R
