40|$|The use of morphospecies as <b>surrogates</b> <b>for</b> {{taxonomic species}} has been {{proposed}} {{as an alternative to}} overcome the identification difficulties associated with many invertebrate studies, such as biodiversity surveys.

The number of Hymenoptera morphospecies and taxonomic species was 37 and 42, respectively, representing an underestimation error of 12 %. Different families presented varying levels of difficulty, and although the species estimation provided by the use of morphospecies initially appeared to have a relatively minor error rate, this was actually an artefact. Splitting and lumping errors balanced each other out, wrongly suggesting that morphospecies were reasonable <b>surrogates</b> <b>for</b> taxonomic species in the Hymenoptera. The use of morphospecies should be adopted only for selected target groups, which have been assessed as reliable <b>surrogates</b> <b>for</b> taxonomic species beforehand, and some prior training to the nonspecialist is likely to be of primary importance...|$|R

40|$|Land {{classes are}} often used in {{conservation}} planning as <b>surrogates</b> <b>for</b> species. The relationship between these surrogates {{and the distribution of}} species is usually assumed but rarely tested. Using broad habitat units (BHUs) to represent biodiversity pattern in the Cape Floristic Region, together with point locality data for species (proteas and selected vertebrates), we calculated the effectiveness of BHUs as <b>surrogates</b> <b>for</b> species. Our planning units were grid cells of about 40 km(2), together with boundaries of existing reserves. After assigning conservation targets to BHUs, we derived minimum sets of planning units to meet all targets and calculated irreplaceability values for all units (irreplaceability measures the likelihood of a unit being required to achieve targets). Results showed that BHUs were good <b>surrogates</b> <b>for</b> the majority of protea species, but were not good <b>surrogates</b> <b>for</b> vertebrate species or for a small subset of protea species. These species shared the following characteristics: rarity, limited ranges, Red Data Book status, specialised habitats not defined by BHUs, and distributions driven by historical rather than contemporary ecological factors. We show that targeting land classes and species simultaneously is a viable option and requires only 0. 1 - 0. 8 % more land (depending on species targets) than targeting land classes alone. We conclude by recommending two different strategies for combining land class and species data in conservation planning, depending on data availability...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of fish diversity surrogates {{is central to}} their utility in conservation planning and management. Here we examine the linkages among a range of biotic and abiotic <b>surrogates</b> <b>for</b> estuarine fish diversity within the Port Stephens estuary in NSW, Australia. We examine the effectiveness of using biotic habitats as <b>surrogates</b> <b>for</b> diversity, and examine whether this surrogacy persists through time. The study was conducted using fish assemblage data gathered across eight a priori identified biotic habitat types. Significant differences in fish assemblages, species richness, and functional richness were detected among 26 out of 28 biotic habitats pairs, and these differences persisted for over 1 year within key Dendronephthya australis (soft coral) and filter feeder habitats, demonstrating the potential for biotic habitats {{to be used as}} <b>surrogates</b> <b>for</b> estuarine fish diversity. Significant correlations between abiotic variables (i. e. depth, location, substrate type, and substrate complexity) and fish assemblages were also established. Overall, the results demonstrate that both abiotic variables and biotic habitats can be used as <b>surrogates</b> <b>for</b> fish diversity in the study estuary, and combining both these types of predictor variables can provide a high level of discrimination among estuarine fish assemblages. The use of both abiotic variables and biotic habitats in conservation planning can, therefore, improve representation of estuarine fishes within marine protected areas...|$|R

Once Ryan reveals himself to be alive a little after this, Kendall comes to the shocking realization that her husband helped Ryan fake his death. She is enraged at Zach, and states that she never would have taken {{on the task of}} being Greenlee's surrogate if she had known that Ryan is alive. Zach and Kendall fight on and off, but no matter their argumentative nature, Zach has developed true romantic feelings for Kendall. At this point, Greenlee has discovered that Kendall is pregnant not with Greenlee and Ryan's baby, but rather with Kendall and Ryan's baby. She spills this knowledge to the whole town, stating that Kendall has betrayed her in order to produce a child between Ryan and herself. Kendall is embarrassed and heartbroken at Greenlee's accusation, and tries to explain that Greenlee's eggs had been destroyed at implantation time, and if she had not used her own eggs, Greenlee would have been without Ryan's child for certain. Greenlee does not care to listen and soon leaves town. Zach sticks by Kendall's side and tells her of his love for her. Kendall is afraid of his declaration, and starts to distance herself from him. She asks for a divorce, not admitting that she feels the same way. Zach agrees to grant her a divorce, but Bianca Montgomery, Kendall's sister, counsels Zach to not give up on Kendall.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} {{relative}} contribution of <b>surrogates</b> <b>for</b> mechanical stress and systemic processes with osteoarthritis (OA) in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing joints. METHODS: The Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity {{study is a}} population-based cohort including 6673 participants (range 45 - 65 years, 56 % women, median body mass index 26 kg/m(2)). Weight (kg) and fat mass (kg) were measured, fat-free mass (kg) was calculated. The metabolic syndrome was defined following the Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. Knee and hand OA were defined according to the American College of Rheumatology clinical criteria. Logistic regression analyses were performed to associate <b>surrogates</b> <b>for</b> mechanical stress (such as weight, fat-free mass) and systemic processes (such as metabolic syndrome) with OA in knees alone, knees and hands or hands alone, adjusted for age, sex, height, smoking, education and ethnicity, and when appropriate for metabolic factors and weight. RESULTS: Knee, knee and hand, and hand OA were present in 10 %, 4 % and 8 % of the participants, respectively. Knee OA was associated with weight and fat-free mass, adjusted for metabolic factors (OR 1. 49 (95 % CI 1. 32 to 1. 68) and 2. 05 (1. 60 to 2. 62), respectively). Similar results were found for OA in knees and hands (OR 1. 51 (95 % CI 1. 29 to 1. 78) and 2. 17 (95 % CI 1. 52 to 3. 10) respectively).

40|$|While a {{large number}} of {{non-linear}} hillslope and catchment rainfall-runoff responses have been attributed to the temporal variability in antecedent moisture conditions (AMCs), two problems emerge: (1) the difficulty of measuring AMCs, and (2) the absence of explicit guidelines for the choice of <b>surrogates</b> or proxies <b>for</b> AMCs. This paper aims at determining whether or not multiple <b>surrogates</b> <b>for</b> AMCs should be used in order not to bias our understanding of a system hydrological behaviour. We worked in a small forested catchment, the Hermine, where soil moisture has been measured at 121 different locations at four depths on 16 occasions. Without making any assumption on active processes, we used various linear and nonlinear regression models (i. e. linear, quadratic, cubic, exponential, logarithmic and logistic) to evaluate the point-scale temporal relations between actual soil moisture contents and selected meteorological-based <b>surrogates</b> <b>for</b> AMCs. We then mapped the nature of the "best fit" model to identify (1) spatial clusters of soil moisture monitoring sites whose hydrological behaviour was similar, and (2) potential topographic influences on these behaviours. Two conclusions stood out. Firstly, it was shown that the sole reference to AMCs indices traditionally used in catchment hydrology, namely antecedent rainfall amounts summed over periods of seven or ten days, would have led to an incomplete understanding of the Hermine catchment dynamics. Secondly, the relationships between point-scale soil moisture content and <b>surrogates</b> <b>for</b> AMCs were not spatially homogeneous, thus revealing a mosaic of linear and nonlinear catchment "active" and "contributing" sources whose locations were seldom controlled by surface terrain attributes or the topography of a soil-confining layer interface. These results represent a step forward for the Hermine catchment as they point towards depth-specific processes and spatially-variable triggering conditions that are not controlled by topography. Further investigations are, however, necessary in order to derive general guidelines for the choice of the best <b>surrogates</b> <b>for</b> AMCs in a catchment...|$|R
