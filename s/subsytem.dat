50|$|The DYNASUIT is a {{conceptual}} design that involves a suit {{that can be}} divided into many subsystems. Each <b>subsytem</b> controls a different aspect of the suit. For example, there is a bio-parameter subsystem that would measure physiological responses like muscle signals (EMG), heart rate, electrocardiogram, ventilation rate, body temperature, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation. There is also a central control unit or the equivalent of the suit's brain, as well as an artificial muscle subsystem that proposes to use either electro-active polymers (EAP) or pneumatics to apply forces on the body. There is also a proposed user interface to help the astronaut interact with the suit. This potential design is still in the development phase and has not been prototyped at this point.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Power {{consumption}} of the display <b>subsytem</b> has been a relatively less explored area compared to other components of a mobile device including computing, storage, and networking units, although the former often constitutes {{one of the most}} power-hungry portions of the system. Typical applications on a mobile device such as web browsing and text editing tend to have rather static image content; each frame hardly changes from the previous one. Efficiently detecting and handling no-motion scenarios is thus critical to extend the battery life. This paper focuses on image change detection. We propose to use checksum to detect image changes. Specifically, CRC hardware is used to optimize the power {{consumption of}} 1) refresh of a local display and 2) data compression for wireless remote display. Compared with a traditional, pixel-bypixel comparison approach, using checksum for image chang...|$|E

To date, all methods of characterization of quantum dynamics (CQD), typically implemented by quantum process tomography, are off-line, i. e., QCC and CQD are not concurrent, as they require distinct state preparations. Here we introduce a method, “quantum error correction based characterization of dynamics,” in which the initial state is any element from the code space of a quantum error correcting code that can protect the state from arbitrary errors acting on the <b>subsytem</b> subjected to unknown dynamics. The statistics of stabilizer measurements, with possible unitary preprocessing operations, are used to characterize the noise, while the observed syndrome {{can be used to}} correct the noisy state.
