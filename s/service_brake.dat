25|$|Prior to each {{leaf fall}} season many train {{companies}} arrange low adhesion training for their newly qualified drivers. This consists of taking over {{a section of}} line during a quiet period. Using lineside markers each driver gets his train up to speed and then makes a Full <b>Service</b> <b>brake</b> under normal adhesion conditions. The railhead is then treated with a contaminant that has a low coefficient of friction. On the second run the driver will experience the sound and sensation of the train sliding, and the stopping distance will be considerably greater.|$|E
25|$|The {{front axle}} was drop forged {{as a single}} piece of {{vanadium}} steel. Ford twisted many axles through eight full rotations (2880 degrees) and sent them to dealers to be put on display to demonstrate its superiority. The Model T did not have a modern <b>service</b> <b>brake.</b> The right foot pedal applied a band around a drum in the transmission, thus stopping the rear wheels from turning. The previously mentioned parking brake lever operated band brakes acting {{on the inside of the}} rear brake drums, which were an integral part of the rear wheel hubs. Optional brakes that acted on the outside of the brake drums were available from aftermarket suppliers.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{its latest}} renovation, the {{funicular}} uses angled lift technology with electrical traction {{and is no}} longer a funicular in the proper sense: it no longer functions with the traditional alternative movement of funiculars (where the descending cabin acts as a counterweight to the ascending one). The machinery resides in the higher station; it is composed of two totally independent AKROS winches powered by [...] motors. The cabins each weigh [...] unladen, [...] when full. They have a <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> and an emergency brake. The carriages and chassis were made by Skirail, and the electrics by Poma.|$|E
2500|$|The {{speed limit}} on the segment of track where the {{derailment}} happened was [...] The data recorder {{in the rear of}} the train (the rear cars were new and equipped with many extra devices) later showed that the train was moving at [...] at that point. Investigators ran a series of simulations and calculated that the train would derail on that curve if going any speed over [...] It is believed that Ryūjirō Takami was so stressed about the inevitability of going back to nikkin kyoiku due to the two infractions from earlier (the red light he had overrun and the platform overshoot) that he did not notice that the train was going too fast. And when the driver did notice it, 4 seconds before the derailment, he used the <b>service</b> <b>brake,</b> instead of the emergency brake, to avoid another infraction, since use of the emergency brake had to be justified.|$|E
2500|$|From 1936 to 1945, PCC {{cars were}} 'Air-Electrics' with {{friction}} brakes, doors, and windshield wipers operated by air pressure. [...] PRCo PCC 1600 of 1945 was the post WW2 All-Electric Demonstrator which eliminated the air compressor and associated piping while incorporating such features as standee windows, a sloped windshield to eliminate night time glare, redesigned back end, forced-air ventilation, and other features. [...] Dynamic brakes were the <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> on all PCCs; when almost stopped, friction brakes completed the stop {{and held the}} car in [...] "park". [...] Dynamic brakes slowed the [...] "Air" [...] cars to 3.0-mph at which point a lock-out relay allowed automatic application of air-applied friction brakes against {{each of the eight}} wheels. [...] On All-Electric cars the dynamics were effective to 0.75-mph where the lockout relay then allowed a spring applied friction brake to engage a drum on each of the four motor drive shafts; this completed the stop and held the car in park. [...] Drum brakes were released by an electric solenoid operating from low-voltage battery power; a power failure would prevent the drums from releasing which would prevent power application, a fail-safe feature. Drum brakes were quite popular and greatly reduced maintenance thus some [...] "Air" [...] cars were retrofitted with drums. [...] Four magnetic brakes, one between the wheels on each side of each truck, applied additional braking for emergency stopping where all brakes were generally employed.|$|E

50|$|Unlike the original, the new {{funicular}} {{used two}} separate haulage systems (one for each car), {{with the two}} systems connected to each other, the drive motor, and the <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> by a gear train; it was the failure of this gear train that was the immediate cause of the accident since it effectively disconnected Sinai both from Olivet’s balancing load and from the <b>service</b> <b>brake.</b> There were emergency brakes that acted {{on the rim of}} each haulage drum, but due to inadequate maintenance, the emergency brakes for both cars were inoperative, which left Sinai without any brakes once its physical connection to the <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> was lost. Contrary to what might be expected, the new funicular was constructed with neither safety cable nor track brakes, either of which would have prevented the accident; the NTSB was unable to identify another funicular worldwide that operated without either of these safety features.|$|E

50|$|In the {{automotive}} industry, brake-by-wire {{technology is the}} ability to control brakes through electrical means. It can be designed to supplement ordinary <b>service</b> <b>brakes</b> or it can be a standalone brake system.|$|R
5000|$|The daily {{brake test}} had {{included}} testing the <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> and emergency brake separately instead of testing them simultaneously (which {{made it impossible}} to confirm that they were both working).|$|E
50|$|With a <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> {{relay valve}} installed, the hose that {{connects to the}} primary delivery-port output of the foot-valve becomes a control-line (i.e., The air from the foot-valve “dead ends” at the relay valve's control-port.). Only low-volume air-signals are {{required}} to travel {{back and forth between}} the foot-valve's delivery port and the relay valve's control port; therefore, the air-volume supplied by the delivery port is now only a tiny-fraction of what otherwise would have been required had the relay valve not been installed. This reduces the delay between the application of the front and rear brakes to only a fraction of a second. When the driver depresses the brake pedal, a small amount of air momentarily opens the relay valve's supply port, which then directs air from the remote air-supply directly to the rear <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> chambers, and quickly applies the rear service brakes. The pressure delivered to the <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> chambers in this manner will equal the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve to the relay valve. When the driver partially or fully releases the brake pedal, the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve decreases; this causes the relay valve's supply port to close, and its exhaust port to momentarily open, thus preventing a pneumatic short-circuit from occurring while the air exhausts from all rear <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> chambers.|$|E
50|$|Without relay valves, {{it would}} take too long for {{sufficient}} air to travel from the brake pedal valve {{to the rear of}} the truck or trailer in order to apply the rear service brakes concurrently with the front service brakes, resulting in a condition known as brake lag. To correct this condition on a long-wheel-base vehicle, a relay valve is installed near the rear <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> chambers. In tractors as well as straight-trucks, a remote air-supply is provided in the form of a large diameter pipe connected between the primary reservoir and the relay valve for remote <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> application.|$|E

25|$|In normal {{operation}} for locomotive/carriage trains, on descending and level running, {{the train is}} normally <b>braked</b> (<b>service</b> <b>braking)</b> using the locomotive. This uses compression braking – the energy is absorbed by using the cylinders as pumps, then dumping the pressure, similar to a Jake brake – on steam locomotives, hydraulic braking on the diesel locomotives. The diesel-electric railcars were <b>service</b> <b>braked</b> using hydraulic brakes and dynamic braking, during which power was dissipated in roof-mounted resistors, creating a distinct heat shimmer when the vehicles were descending and shortly afterwards. The hand brakes are used to bring a train to a complete stand from low speed, and as a parking brake.|$|R
50|$|The <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> {{consists}} of hydraulically operated drum brakes, which are same size {{on the front}} and the rear axle. Initially a dual-circuit system with vacuum servo was optional; later servo became standard. The handbrake works mechanically.|$|E
50|$|The {{control system}} is further {{divided into two}} <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> {{circuits}}, the parking brake circuit, and the trailer brake circuit. The dual <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> circuits are further split into front and rear wheel circuits which receive compressed air from their individual reservoirs for added safety {{in case of an}} air leak. The service brakes are applied by means of a brake pedal air valve which regulates both circuits. The parking brake is the air operated spring brake type where its applied by spring force in the spring brake cylinder and released by compressed air via hand control valve. The trailer brake consists of a direct two line system: the supply line (marked red) and the separate control or service line (marked blue). The supply line receives air from the prime mover park brake air tank via a park brake relay valve and the control line is regulated via the trailer brake relay valve. The operating signals for the relay are provided by the prime mover brake pedal air valve, trailer <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> hand control (subject to local heavy vehicle legislation) and the prime mover park brake hand control.|$|E
5000|$|On {{automatic}} transmission vehicles, a shift interlock, which needs the <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> {{to be applied}} before the transmission can {{be taken out of}} the park position, as well as a low-oil-level light was added. The 3.1L V6 equipped cars also lost the [...] "3.1L Multi-Port V6" [...] fender badge.|$|E
50|$|Brakes were {{air over}} {{hydraulic}} with drum brakes on all wheels. Air brake connections at the rear were used for trailer brakes. The M815, M818, and M819 had separate controls to apply the trailer brakes separately from the <b>service</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} control the trailer <b>service</b> <b>brakes,</b> the merged outputs (i.e., merged via 2 two-way check valves {{connected}} in-series to give three inputs) of the foot-valve and trailer-hand-valve (if applicable) are directed through the tractor-protection valve, and onward towards the trailer relay valve via the blue service line. In tractors that are not equipped with a trailer hand valve, only the merged outputs of the foot-valve (i.e., via a single two-way check valve) are directed towards the trailer relay valve; however, {{the fact that the}} foot-valve's delivery-port outputs are still merged enables the trailer's <b>service</b> <b>brakes</b> to still be controlled even if there is failure within one braking circuit of the tractor.|$|R

50|$|During the test, the {{computer}} measures the brake force {{values and the}} system will calculate the imbalance between {{the left and right}} brake forces of an axle, as well as the brake efficiency of the <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> and the parking brake provided that a vehicle weight is either inputted manually or by using an integrated weighing system.|$|E
50|$|The drive {{terminal}} is {{also the}} location of a lift's primary braking system. The <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> is located on the drive shaft beside the main drive, before the gearbox. The emergency brake acts directly on the bullwheel. While not technically a brake, an anti-rollback device (usually a cam) also acts on the bullwheel. This prevents the potentially disastrous situation of runaway reverse operation.|$|E

50|$|The <b>service</b> <b>brakes</b> are {{hydraulically}} operated drum brakes, which are similar type {{both on the}} rear and the front axle. Each brake includes two slave cylinders.
