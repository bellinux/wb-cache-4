5|$|Tony Iommi {{has been}} {{credited}} as the pioneer of lighter gauge guitar strings. The {{tips of his}} fingers were severed in a <b>steel</b> <b>factory,</b> and while using thimbles (artificial finger tips) he found that standard guitar strings were too difficult to bend and play. He found that there was only one size of strings available, so after years with Sabbath he had strings custom made.|$|E
5|$|When Grill {{returned}} to Sweden in 1768, he first lived in Stockholm where he occupied himself with trade. He owned a malmgård (suburban manor) at Ersta {{in the south}} part of Stockholm, where he established a crucible <b>steel</b> <b>factory</b> {{with the help of}} Bengt Andersson Qvist in 1770.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally {{there had}} been a muffled thud or deadened {{explosion}} within the ship. Now, without warning she seemed to start forward, moving forward and into the water at an angle of about fifteen degrees. This movement with the water rushing up toward us was accompanied by a rumbling roar, mixed with more muffled explosions. It was like standing under a steel railway bridge while an express train passes overhead mingled with the noise of a pressed <b>steel</b> <b>factory</b> and wholesale breakage of china.|$|E
5000|$|Today, {{three major}} Pressed <b>Steel</b> <b>factories</b> {{are still in}} operation; the Cowley plant, BMW's Mini is {{assembled}} and this site is known as [...] "Plant Oxford". At their Swindon plant, the BMW subsidiary Swindon Pressings Limited has been established and produces parts for the new Mini at what is now referred to as [...] "Plant Swindon". Pressed <b>Steel's</b> <b>factory</b> in Castle Bromwich now forms part of Jaguar's main assembly plant.|$|R

5|$|During the mid 1990s, Ramiz Sadiku was docked {{for a major}} {{overhaul}} and reconstruction. However, {{due to the lack}} of funds the work was never completed and the boat was decommissioned and eventually sold for scrap. The boat's superstructure, propulsion, sensors and weapon systems were dismantled, after which the new owner moved the boat to an underground naval dock on the Luštica peninsula. The boat remained there for several years, before its deteriorating condition caused it to sink inside the dock. The wreck was raised in 2014 and towed to Zelenika where it was broken up to smaller segments which were then transported to the Nikšić <b>steel</b> <b>factory.</b>|$|E
5|$|Grill married Lovisa Ulrika Lüning (1744–1824) in Stockholm in 1772. They had ten children. She was the {{daughter}} of wholesaler Johan Christian Lüning and Margaretha Sabbath. In 1775, Grill sold the manor and the <b>steel</b> <b>factory</b> to Qvist and moved to Godegård where he had bought the manor and the ironworks from the estate of Jean de Geer. In doing so he followed the pattern of other supercargos who made their fortunes abroad during {{a short period of time}} in the East India trade and on their return invested their money in Swedish factories and farms.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper station}} of the incline has {{a gift shop}} that sells souvenirs and snack foods; a visitor center is also located {{adjacent}} to the station. The mechanical room housing the incline's electric motor and hoisting mechanism can be viewed from windows in the gift shop and {{the lobby of the}} visitor center. An observation deck providing views of the incline, the city, and the valley is located {{on the opposite side of}} the station from the visitor center. Two hiking trails allow visitors to walk the slope. One is a sculpture trail, with works created in 1989 by local artist James Wolfe, who used remnants of the Bethlehem <b>Steel</b> <b>factory</b> in Johnstown.|$|E

25|$|In June 2004, Akhmetov and Viktor Pinchuk (the {{son-in-law}} of then-President Leonid Kuchma) {{acquired the}} <b>steel</b> <b>factory</b> Kryvorizhstal for roughly $800 {{million from the}} state in a 2004 tender despite much higher bids made by foreign companies. Later, in 2005, the first Tymoshenko Government reversed this sale, and held a nationally televised repeat auction that netted a record-breaking $4.8 billion.|$|E
50|$|For many years, Ricardo Wolf and {{his brother}} Sigfried Wolf worked to develop a process for {{recovering}} iron from smelting process residue. Ultimately successful, his invention was utilized in <b>steel</b> <b>factories</b> all over the world, bringing him considerable wealth.|$|R
5000|$|... == Industry == As of 2011 {{aluminum}} and <b>steel</b> <b>factories</b> were {{under construction in}} the region. Lamerd International Airport opened in 1964, with flights to Tehran, Shiraz, Lar, Lavan and international flights to Kuwait, Qatar and United Arab Emirates.|$|R

25|$|Black-and-white film in {{that era}} was {{sensitive}} to blue light, not the reds and oranges of hot steel, {{so she could see}} the beauty, but the photographs were coming out all black. She solved this problem by bringing along a new style of magnesium flare, which produces white light, and having assistants hold them to light her scenes. Her abilities resulted in some of the best <b>steel</b> <b>factory</b> photographs of that era, which earned her national attention.|$|E
25|$|Manufacturing, while {{large in}} dollar value, is highly diversified with no sub-sector {{contributing}} over 20 {{percent of the}} total. Typical forms of manufacturing include electronics, computer equipment, and chemicals. The once mighty primary metals sub-sector, which at one time included {{what was then the}} largest <b>steel</b> <b>factory</b> in the world at Sparrows Point, still exists, but is pressed with foreign competition, bankruptcies, and mergers. During World War II the Glenn Martin Company (now part of Lockheed Martin) airplane factory employed some 40,000 people.|$|E
25|$|Finn-Baltic {{left the}} port of Raahe with a cargo of 13,398 tons of Malmberget A Fines (MAF) iron ore {{concentrate}} bound for the <b>steel</b> <b>factory</b> of Koverhar in Hanko, southern Finland, on 25 December 1990. Baltic had been loaded in Luleå, Sweden, on 21 December and brought to Raahe by the pusher Rautaruukki {{on the following day}} to wait for transit to the south. During its stay in Raahe, the barge developed a list of 1–2 degrees to port and the harbour workers noted that the cargo seemed to be wet and some of the ore heaps had collapsed.|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} three decades there have been {{tremendous}} efforts on building <b>steel</b> <b>factories</b> on economic scales. The primary question is to find an economic scale for such plants which could also meet domestic demand. In this paper, we perform an empirical survey to find out whether building small <b>steel</b> <b>factories</b> are more suitable or setting up giant steel industries to meet regional demands. The results indicate that in many countries, building small steel plants based on the recent advances of technologies not only reduces the total cost of steel production but also it could significantly reduce the unnecessary transportation cost, providing cheaper labor, etc. This would lead to better competition which would increase the productivity...|$|R
50|$|In {{terms of}} {{production}} levels, after the catastrophic results of 1940 {{due to the}} invasion and ongoing war, steel production soon resumed but at a reduced rate. Luxembourgish <b>steel</b> <b>factories</b> no longer received a sufficient supply of coke, since the Germans believed it was more efficient to process Swedish ore, which had a higher iron content than Luxembourgish ore. However, when Nazi Germany moved to a strategy of total war, involving the mobilisation of all resources, the Armaments Minister Albert Speer ensured that from February 1942, Luxembourgish <b>steel</b> <b>factories</b> could work properly. Production increased steadily from mid-1942, and wartime production reached its peak in early 1944, when it also reached pre-war levels.|$|R
2500|$|Heavy {{industry}} used to {{be concentrated}} in the Naples metropolitan area, in which the largest industrial area was Bagnoli, a suburb located North of the city. Bagnoli enjoyed a favourable logistic position due its proximity to the sea and to an industrial harbour, and included <b>Steel</b> <b>factories</b> that were among the largest in Europe. The <b>steel</b> <b>factories</b> operated since 1905 for about 80 years, {{but by the end}} of the sixties, all industries of Bagnoli area gradually started to lose competitiveness, and the <b>steel</b> <b>factories</b> were definitively closed in 1991. At the beginning of the 70s, plans for the de-industrialization of the area were presented, as it was perceived that the causes of competitiveness loss were impossible to remove. In 1970 the City Council decided that 30% of space of the industrial should be dismantled and turned into public parks. In 1976, a definitive report concluded that the lack of competitiveness was due to [...] "impossibility to expand the facilities because of lack of space". The metropolitan area of Naples is limited by two dangerous areas, the Mount Vesuvius on the South, and supervolcano Campi Flegrei on the North, leaving little space in proximity of the sea.|$|R
25|$|Alexei Ivanov, a shy <b>steel</b> <b>factory</b> worker, greatly surpasses his {{production}} quota and is chosen {{to receive the}} Order of Lenin {{and to have a}} personal interview with Joseph Stalin. Alexei falls in love with the idealist teacher Natasha, but has difficulties approaching her. When he meets Stalin, who tends his garden, the leader helps him to understand his emotions and tells him to recite poetry to her. Then, they both have a luncheon {{with the rest of the}} Soviet leadership in Stalin's home. After returning from Moscow, Alexei confesses his love to Natasha. While they are both having a stroll in a wheat field, their town is attacked by the Germans, who invade the Soviet Union.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{continued}} with a night shoot on 6 December; scenes {{inside and outside}} the pub on Christmas Day were filmed in The Conway pub in Pontcanna before relocating to a nearby park to film scenes contemporary with the events of [...] "The Poison Sky". Thompson Park was originally scheduled for the shoot; the location was changed at short notice to Sophia Gardens because Tate was suffering from a mild case of influenza. The final scenes to be filmed—the scenes in the makeshift UNIT base—were filmed in a decommissioned <b>steel</b> <b>factory</b> in Pontypool, on 7 December and 8 December. Filming for the episode was completed with pick-up shots in January 2008.|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "Aagadu" [...] {{was filmed}} on Mahesh and few dancers at the Jindal <b>Steel</b> <b>Factory,</b> Bellary in October 2013. This {{became the first}} Telugu film to be shot there and also made the factory a notable {{location}} for the song shoots of Kannada films such as Rana Vikrama (2015), Ranna (2015), and Mr. Airavata (2015). Both the song and fight sequences were filmed in 23 days. Mahesh {{and the members of}} the film's unit had fallen sick and continued work using antibiotics. Mahesh called it the [...] "most strenuous schedule I went through in my life", and added, [...] "For every shot, they had to get the dust up to get the right visual. Room kocchi snanam chesthe (...) I would see only mud. It’s very dangerous".|$|E

500|$|Hamilton Disston {{was born}} in Philadelphia, [...] the eldest son of nine {{children}} born to Mary Steelman and Henry Disston, an English immigrant and descendant of French nobility. [...] Disston's father was a successful industrialist who rose from being orphaned just days after arriving in the United States to running the Keystone Saw Works when Hamilton was a child. [...] Henry Disston was responsible for multiple machining and saw patents, and {{in the spirit of}} Victorian-era paternalism, envisioned and engineered a community around his <b>steel</b> <b>factory</b> in Tacony, Pennsylvania. [...] After attending public school, Hamilton left at 15 years old, opting for an apprenticeship at the saw factory which, by that time, was a $500,000-per-year international venture. [...] His father threatened to fire him for repeatedly leaving the factory to work for a volunteer fire department. [...] Hamilton twice joined the Union Army only to have Henry purchase his release, but Hamilton organized a Company of saw factory employees during the Gettysburg Campaign. [...] Henry finally agreed to support the [...] "Disston Volunteers" [...] financially.|$|E
500|$|Lionel Andrés Messi {{was born}} on 24 June 1987 in Rosario, the third of four {{children}} of Jorge Messi, a <b>steel</b> <b>factory</b> manager, and his wife Celia Cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. On his father's side, he is of Italian and Spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from Marche and Catalonia, and on his mother's side, he has primarily Italian ancestry. Growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, [...] "Leo" [...] developed {{a passion for the}} sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, Rodrigo and Matías, and his cousins, Maximiliano and Emanuel Biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers. At the age of four he joined local club Grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, Celia, who accompanied him to training and matches. He was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout Catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute of his grandmother.|$|E

50|$|This song {{is about}} young {{people living in}} the Northeast of America. Their lives are miserable because the <b>steel</b> <b>factories</b> are closing down. They desperately want to leave... but they stay because they were brought up to believe that things were going to get better. Maybe that sounds familiar.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to its <b>steel</b> <b>factories,</b> Seraing {{is home to the}} crystal manufacture Val Saint Lambert, which has been operating on the site of an old Cistercian abbey since 1826.
