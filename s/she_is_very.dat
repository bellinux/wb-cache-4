5|$|A {{third year}} {{student and the}} current leader of the Juken Club. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> skilled in various martial arts, but does not possess the Dragon's Eye like her siblings.

Early in the series, she would use a body manipulation technique to revert herself into her childhood form to conserve her ki. She also has an argument to settle with Mitsuomi Takayanagi.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{circumstances}} of the separation, Holopainen's appreciation of Turunen as an artist remained. He explained that he did not search for a similarly trained singer as a successor for Turunen because he considers her to be extraordinarily good in her genre and therefore irreplaceable. Turunen {{said in an interview that}} <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> proud of her career with Nightwish. She considers the remaining band members extremely talented and wishes all the best for them and their subsequent lead singer Anette Olzon.|$|E

5|$|In the B story, April (Aubrey Plaza) {{is working}} as Chris' (Rob Lowe) {{assistant}} until {{he goes back}} to Indianapolis. April's cynical personality clashes with Chris' relentless optimism and happiness. In an attempt to get fired, April purposely neglects to tell Ann (Rashida Jones) that Chris cannot make a lunch date. When Ann arrives to confront Chris, she quickly realizes April's ploy. Ann reveals <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> happy dating Chris, and would even probably move with him to Indianapolis if asked. Andy (Chris Pratt), who is still trying to win back April's affections, gives Chris an obviously forged letter from the FBI claiming April must immediately return to the parks department. Chris sees through the ruse and tells April she can go back, but that remaining his assistant may provide her career opportunities. He invites her to return with him to Indianapolis and she seems interested, leaving both Ann and Andy stunned and jealous.|$|E

An angry Ron (Nick Offerman) tells Leslie the town is now open to a large potential lawsuit from Andy, and he sends her to visit him along with their city attorney Scott (H. Jon Benjamin). Meanwhile, Andy is excited to be near Ann and insists {{it will lead to}} them getting back together, but Ann tells him <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> happy dating Mark, who unlike Andy has a job, apartment and future. A disheartened Andy decides he has to get money to impress Ann. When Leslie visits, he regretfully tells her he and his attorney Wendell Adams (Chris Tallman) are going to sue Pawnee.|$|E
5|$|The film {{continues}} to be appreciated for its experimental nature, its camera angles and montage elements being treated in an unusual manner, while the fiction elements of the screenplay hint of magic realism. In this sense, {{it is important to}} mention that the days in the film are separated by Andrei's erotic dreams. In his dreams, the differences between him and Marilena are partially removed, either by lowering the rooftop on which the boy stands to ground level or by debarking the girl from a breast-shaped UFO that scares the neighbors away. Another fictional element is Marilena's capacity of provoking short circuits, in moments in which <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> emotionally active (e.g., when Andrei touches her in the bar's restroom, or when the whole neighborhood is cut from electricity when she cries near the high voltage electrical box).|$|E
5|$|Hikari Konohana, a shy {{and quiet}} girl, {{is the main}} focus among the main {{characters}} who attend Spica. The next Spica character is Yaya Nanto, a rebellious girl who is Hikari's best friend and roommate in the dormitory. In the anime, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> much enamored with Hikari, but Hikari sees her as a friend; in the manga, Yaya is not a prominent character. Both she and Hikari {{are members of the}} St. Spica Choir. Hikari meets an older girl named Amane Ohtori early on in the story who is seen much like a prince from a fairy tale by other Spica students due to often riding a white horse named Star Bright. Amane is admired by many of the students from Spica as well as students from the other two schools, although she does not enjoy the attention. In the anime, Hikari admires her deeply, and she and Amane have mutual interest in each other. The final girl from Spica is Tsubomi Okuwaka, a young first year student who acts maturely for her age and gets on Yaya's nerves. She too is in the St. Spica Choir, although Hikari was her main motivation for joining. In the anime, her interest in Hikari seems to purely be one of friendship; in the manga, she, like Yaya, is not a prominent character. Tsubomi once remarked that Yaya was more skilled than Hikari at singing in the choir.|$|E

5000|$|Harmon Tupper died in 1988 and Elsie {{remained}} in Nantucket {{for the remainder}} of her life. Her final visit with daughter Paula was so disastrous that when Elsie died months later, at age 90, Paula [...] "felt hollow, listless," [...] and did not mourn her. Elsie's granddaughter, Linda Carroll, likewise claims that when she visited Elsie shortly before the latter's death, Elsie [...] "answered the door and said, 'Are you a Jehovah's Witness?' I said, 'No, actually I'm your granddaughter.' <b>She</b> <b>was</b> really remarkable, really fun. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> estranged from my mother. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> gracious, but <b>she</b> wasn't warm. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> cold." ...|$|R
5|$|Kotarou invites {{three other}} girls into the occult {{research}} society {{who are also}} heroines in the game. One is Kotori Kanbe, Kotarou's childhood friend in his class who has few friends and starts attending school regularly after joining the club. She has a playful personality and has an extremely strong pet dog named Chibi-Moth, which is actually a familiar created by Kotori {{from the body of}} her dead pet dog Pero. However, she is not affiliated with Gaia or Guardian, and instead follows in the path of an ancient sect of summoners called Druids who revered nature and protected Kagari with familiars. Another heroine is first-year student Sizuru Nakatsu, a shy girl on the public morals committee who has excellent hearing, eyesight and can read lips. She has heterochromia, though wears an eyepatch over her golden-colored right eye as <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> self-conscious about it; her left eye is blue. Sizuru is a member of Guardian who has the ability to produce various chemicals inside her body which can be used to heal herself and others, paralyze and cause amnesia. Sizuru joins the club with her close friend Lucia Konohana, another heroine and the class representative of Kotarou's class. Lucia is easily agitated by the antics of boys and often punches Kotarou when he annoys her. She is obsessed with cleanliness and always wears gloves. Like Sizuru, Lucia is a member of Guardian and has the ability to produces poisonous miasma and pus {{as a result of an}} experiment by Guardian, which she takes medication for to suppress. She can also create vibrations within the objects she touches and break glass at a distance.
