40|$|International audienceSince {{numerical}} {{weather prediction}} (NWP) models are usually used to force ocean circulation models, {{it is important to}} investigate their skill in reproducing surface meteorological parameters in open sea conditions. Near-surface meteorological data (air temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure, wind speed and direction) have been acquired from several sensors deployed on an offshore large spar buoy in the Ligurian Sea (Northern Mediterranean Sea) from February to December 2000. The buoy collected 7857 valid records out of 8040 during 335 days at sea. These observations have been compared with data from NWP models and specifically, the outputs of the ECMWF analysis in the two grid points closest to the buoy position. Hourly data acquired by the buoy have been undersampled to fit the data set of the model composed by values computed at the four <b>synoptic</b> <b>hours.</b> For each mentioned meteorological parameter an analysis has been performed by evaluating instantaneous synoptic differences, distributions, daily and annual variations and related statistics. The comparison shows that the model reproduces correctly the baric field while significant differences result for the other variables, which are more affected by local conditions. This suggests that the observed discrepancies {{may be due to the}} poor resolution of the model that probably is not sufficient to appropriately discriminate between land and ocean surfaces in a small basin such as the Ligurian Sea and to take into account local peculiarities. The use of time- and space-averaged model data reduces the differences with respect to the in situ observations, thus making the model data usable for analysis with minor requirements about time and space resolution. Although this comparison is strongly limited and we cannot exclude measurement errors, its results suggest a great caution in the use of the model data, especially at high frequency resolution. They may lead to incorrect estimates of atmospheric forcing into ocean circulation models, causing important errors in those areas, such as the Mediterranean Sea, where ocean circulation is strongly coupled with atmosphere and its high variability.

40|$|An Objective 500 -hPa cyclone {{detection}} and analysis is performed during the warm-dry period (16 April to 15 October) of year for Central and Eastern Mediterranean Region (30 °N- 50 °N, 5 °E- 35 °E). The 40 -year NCEP/NCAR reanalyzes gridded data of geopotential height and temperature {{employed in the}} study, enable a climatic approach with a spatial (2. 5 °X 2. 5 °) and a 6 -hour temporal (00, 06, 12, 18 UTC) resolution. The occurrence frequency of these cyclones (low centres), for the entire region, shows an interannual variability with a variation coefficient of 17 %, without a significant trend. Investigation of the typical dimensions of these systems {{is based on the}} estimation of a typical radius around the centre. The prevailing value of typical radius indicates the domination of sub-synoptic lows. Only 56 % of the detected cyclones are related to temperature minima at the same level. Vertical structure of these systems is usually maintained at 700 and 300 hPa levels. On the other hand only 50 % of the number of 500 -hPa cyclones is related to 1000 hPa geopotential height minima. At the upper levels (200 hPa), the occurrence of temperature maxima instead of minima above low centres, is quite common. Three primary activity centres (Turkey, Black Sea and Genoa) are objectively determined in the frequency domain as local maxima and their intensity is assessed in terms of average geopotential height at the centre of the lows. The Turkey centre, though the most frequent, consists of shallow lows in contrast to the Black Sea one, which is the second in frequency, but on the average, contains the deepest lows among the three. Genoa centre, which comes third in frequency, shows the highest variability in the geopotential height at the centre of the lows. However, the geopotential height at the centre of the lows depends on both latitude and month of the year. It decreases on the average 10 gpm per degree of latitude and peaks during August. Cyclones at the 500 -hPa level, are usually cut-off south of the main westerlies, during the last stages of their life circle. The situation usually occurs over Tyrrhenian Sea, southeast Aegean, Turkey and the Black Sea. Frequency distributions in the entire area, during the three sub periods (Early, Middle and Late Warm Period) and during the four <b>synoptic</b> <b>hours,</b> provide insight in the origins of these systems and reveals secondary centres, such as the centres in Adriatic (at 18 UTC), Northern Greece (during Middle Warm Period) and South Aegean Sea (during Late Warm Period). The spatial distribution of temperature minima, which are related to 500 hPa cyclones, indicates a different picture between lower and upper levels. At the lower levels, temperature minima are observed over sea surfaces, such as, Tyrrhenian Sea, Gulf of Antalya and the Black Sea. At the upper levels, there is a tendency of unification of these local frequency maxima, over the entire Balkan Peninsula. ...|$|R

A separate comparison of the Rotronic instrument with an HO- 83 hygrometer at NDBC showed generally close agreement over a 1 -month period, which included a number of fog events.

This research investigates snowpack structure and meteorological influences associated with avalanching at Porter Heights Ski Area and overviews the management practices employed in response to this hazard. Data sources are derived from meteorological and snowpack observations dating back to 1977, coupled with comprehensive field studies in 2003. Weak faceted and mixed crystal forms were found to comprise on average over 40 % of the early season snowpack on sunny and shaded slope aspects, although they could persist on shaded slopes throughout the season, contributing to spring avalanche events. The growth of both lower pack depth hoar, and near-surface facets were strongly influenced by <b>synoptic</b> airflows. Forty-eight <b>hours</b> after the onset of a cool southeast airflow, the temperature gradients in a shallow snowpack ranged from - 0. 36 °C cm- 1 near the surface, to - 0. 17 °C cm- 1 deeper in the pack. A warmer northwest flow induced surface melting, and dramatically altered the thermal regime of the snowpack. Thick layers of rounded grains indicated the importance of equilibrium growth and wind redistribution of snow. Wind loading is most extensive on slopes leeward to the prevalent, strong, west to northwest winds, and slab formation in this terrain is regularly controlled using hand placed explosives and ski cutting techniques. Density measurements centred on a median value of 185 kg/nr' suggested the significance of decomposing new snow in forming surface slabs, with the largest snowfalls at Porter Heights occurring during east to southeast storm events. While this study has cemented a comprehensive understanding of meteorology and snowpack structure at Porter Heights, backcountry avalanche forecasting in the neighbouring terrain will further benefit from larger scale, collaborative future research initiatives...|$|R
