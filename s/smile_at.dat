Many will say turn awayaway from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black manand we will smile. They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him <b>smile</b> <b>at</b> you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him... And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves.|$|E

500|$|Brian has {{credited}} {{his brother}} and bandmate Carl for suggesting the cello as an instrument to use.

Alternatively, multi-instrumentalist songwriter Van Dyke Parks says that he suggested having the celloist play triplets for Brian. Parks believes that having Brian exploit the cello [...] "to such a hyperbolic degree" [...] was what encouraged the duo to immediately collaborate on the ultimately unfinished album <b>Smile.</b> <b>At</b> some point, Brian asked Parks to pen lyrics for the song, although Parks declined.|$|E

500|$|Having {{attended}} the concerts six months before, Ed Kelleher of Circus magazine {{was relieved to}} discover that the live album didn't just do justice to the [...] "magic... the sheer joy" [...] of the event, but rather its music [...] "practically jumps right out into your life".

[...] Popjustice commented on Nicola's seemingly lack of confidence in the video, stating Nicola, you light up our world like nobody else. But when you <b>smile</b> <b>at</b> the ground it ain't hard to tell, you don't know you're beautiful.
