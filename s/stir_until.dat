6000|$|... "He {{is asleep}} already," [...] he whispered, [...] "and is {{breathing}} quietly. I think {{it likely that}} he will not <b>stir</b> <b>until</b> tomorrow morning. I shall be here at six. If he wakes, and there is any change, send for me at once." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I must away, boys!" [...] cried Pawnee Brown, {{tearing up}} the note.

60|$|In a {{very few}} minutes the regular {{breathing}} of Giuseppi, who had curled himself up {{in the bottom of}} the boat, showed that he had gone to sleep; and he did not <b>stir</b> <b>until,</b> an hour and a half after the return of Francis, the latter heard the fall of footsteps approaching the gondola.|$|E

6000|$|I {{shook my}} head. [...] "We might be {{detained}} for doing murder. We have no proof yet of their intentions--I think--" [...] An idea flashed suddenly across my mind. [...] "Go {{back to your}} room, Ganymede," [...] I bade him. [...] "Lock yourself in, and do not <b>stir</b> <b>until</b> I call you. I do not wish their suspicions aroused." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{first the}} cunning old Gunga would not consent {{to be bound}} up. But Nod refused to <b>stir</b> <b>until</b> he did. So at last he fetched a thick rope of Samarak (which is {{stronger}} and tougher than Cullum) out of his old chest or coffer, and Nod wound it round and round him--legs, arms, and shoulders--and tied the ends to the great fish-scaly table.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is scarce}} the need," [...] he assured her. [...] "Sir John {{will not be}} like to <b>stir</b> <b>until</b> dead of night, that he may make sure of taking us unawares. I have little doubt that Lionel would reach him. It is none so long a swim. Indeed, once outside the cove he could take to the land until he was abreast of the ship. Never doubt he will have done his errand." ...|$|E
60|$|He cantered away. We {{tried to}} look at each other's faces, and at Bill's {{expression}} in the darkness, but he neither spoke nor <b>stirred</b> <b>until</b> he threw down the reins when we stopped before the station. The passengers quickly descended from the roof; the Expressman was about to follow, but Bill plucked his sleeve.|$|R

60|$|A ladder was brought, and I {{got down}} after the lady, who {{was like a}} haystack: not daring to <b>stir,</b> <b>until</b> her basket was removed. The coach was clear of {{passengers}} by that time, the luggage was very soon cleared out, the horses had been taken out before the luggage, and now the coach itself was wheeled and backed off by some hostlers, out of the way. Still, nobody appeared, to claim the dusty youngster from Blunderstone, Suffolk.|$|E
60|$|Jean himself writhed {{under the}} lash of her scorn. Gaston Isbel turned a dead white. He could not answer her. He seemed {{stricken}} with merciless truth. Slowly dropping his head, he remained motionless, a pathetic and tragic figure; {{and he did}} not <b>stir</b> <b>until</b> the rapid beat of hoofs denoted the approach of horsemen. Blaisdell appeared on his white charger, leading a pack animal. And behind rode a group of men, all heavily armed, and likewise with packs.|$|E
60|$|He slept heavily all night, {{and did not}} <b>stir</b> <b>until</b> {{aroused by}} the postman on his morning round. Martin felt tired and passive, and went through his letters aimlessly. One thin envelope, from a robber magazine, {{contained}} for twenty-two dollars. He had been dunning for it {{for a year and}} a half. He noted its amount apathetically. The old-time thrill at receiving a publisher's check was gone. Unlike his earlier checks, this one was not pregnant with promise of great things to come. To him it was a check for twenty-two dollars, that was all, and it would buy him something to eat.|$|E

60|$|But I have read, at all events, {{though not}} written. And I say, Most masterly and most admirable! It is {{impossible}} to lay the sheets down without finishing them. I showed them to Georgina and Mary, and they read and read and never <b>stirred</b> <b>until</b> they had read all. There cannot be a doubt of the beauty, power, and artistic excellence of the whole.|$|R

Before turning on the UV lamp, the pH of the aqueous solution was adjusted to the desired value by dropwise addition, 0.5  mol HCl solution or NaOH solution (Chengdu Kelong Chemical Co., Ltd).

6000|$|Even some of {{the less}} common and less tame birds care as little for {{a man on a}} bicycle as they do for a cow. Not long ago a peewit trotted leisurely across the road not more than ten yards from my front wheel; and on the same day I came upon a green {{woodpecker}} enjoying a dust-bath in the public road. He declined to <b>stir</b> <b>until</b> I stopped to watch him, then merely flew about a dozen yards away and attached himself to the trunk of a fir tree at the roadside and waited there for me to go. Never in all my wanderings afoot had I seen a yaffingale dusting himself like a barn-door fowl! ...|$|E
60|$|These {{were the}} orders that I {{gave to the}} Amangwane, warning them that he who disobeyed would be punished with death. They were not to <b>stir</b> <b>until</b> I, or, if I should be killed, one of my hunters, fired a shot; for my fear was lest, growing excited, they might leap out before the time and kill some of our own people, who very likely would be mixed up with {{the first of the}} {{pursuing}} Amakoba. Secondly, when the cattle had passed and the signal had been given, they were to rush on the Amakoba, throwing themselves across the gully, so that the enemy would have to fight upwards on a steep slope.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! Miss Feemy, and how's your pretty self this morning?--and is it {{the fact}} what we hear down at Carrick, that we are to have a wedding soon at Ballycloran? Ah! well, of course you wouldn't be after telling me, but I was very glad to hear it; that I was, Miss Feemy. But, Mr. Macdermot--it was your father, Miss Feemy, I was wishing to see this morning, not Mr. Thady--if you could allow me ten minutes or so--just a message from our old friend, Flannelly:"--and by this time Keegan had wedged {{his way into the}} room, out of which any one who knew him would be very sure he would not <b>stir,</b> <b>until</b> he had said what he had come to say.|$|E
60|$|Yet, King {{though he}} might be, there was no ready {{obedience}} from the arrogant Border lord, her lover. It was to Mary that Bothwell looked for commands, nor <b>stirred</b> <b>until</b> she signed to him to go. And even then he went no farther than {{the other side of}} the door, so that he might be close at hand to fortify her should any weakness assail her now in this supreme hour.|$|R

50|$|Kudzu flour, or Kuzuko (葛粉), {{a powder}} ground from the dried {{root of the}} kudzu plant, is mixed into hot water and <b>stirred</b> <b>until</b> thick to produce Kuzuyu. Kudzu flour, {{sometimes}} also used in Asian sauces and soups, is a powerful thickening agent and quickly alters the water's texture. Though lacking fragrance and taste in its powder form, the arrowroot takes on a unique sweet flavor when dissolved in the hot water.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{are going}} to reconnoitre, Osgod, and may be an hour away. As we shall not leave the forest there is no danger, and even were we seen we can climb the hill again as fast as any Welshman can follow us. Do you {{keep an eye on}} the castle, but do not <b>stir</b> <b>until</b> we return even if you hear shouts. I have no doubt that we shall be able to rejoin you, and it is most {{important}} that even if they do make us out they should have no reason for supposing that there is any force behind us." [...] After half an hour's walking Beorn and Wulf found themselves at the edge of the wood in the valley.|$|E
6000|$|Lawford's face smiled--a rather desperate, yet for {{all that}} a patient, {{resolute}} smile. 'Oh yes, of course,' he said, almost to himself, 'I had not foreseen--at least--you must do precisely what you please, Sheila. You were going to lock me in. You will, however, before taking any final step, please think over what it will entail. I did not think you would, after such proof, in this awful trouble--I did not think you would simply disbelieve me, Sheila. Who else is there to help me? You have the letter in your hand. Isn't that sufficient proof? It was overwhelming proof to me. And even I doubted too; doubted myself. But never mind; why I should have dreamed you would believe me; or taken this awful thing differently, I don't know. It's rather awful {{to have to go}} on alone. But there, think it over. I shall not <b>stir</b> <b>until</b> I hear the voices. And then: honestly, Sheila, I couldn't face quite that. I'd sooner give up altogether. Any proof you can think of--I will... O God, I cannot bear it!' He covered his face with his hands; but in a moment looked up, unmoved once more. 'Why, for that matter,' he added slowly, and, as it were, with infinite pains, a faint thin smile again stealing into his face, 'I think,' he turned wearily to the glass, 'I think, it's almost an improvement!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought of}} doing so myself, Beorn, to-night, when he threw a cup of wine over me. But I said to myself my life is not my own, Harold's rescue depends on it. We are bound as his men to suffer in {{patience}} whatever may befall us. In another hour I shall try to make my escape. When it was your turn to wait this evening I stole away for a time, {{and went to the}} shed where they keep the war-engines and took thence a coil of rope, which I have hidden in the courtyard. You know that we noticed last night where the sentries were placed, and decided where I might best drop from the wall unobserved. Fortunately the moat is dry at present, though they can turn water into it from the stream at will, so that once down I shall have no difficulty in getting away. Now I want you to go to sleep directly, I shall not <b>stir</b> <b>until</b> you do so, then when you are questioned in the morning you can say that I was by your side when you went to sleep, and that when you woke in the morning the place was vacant. You can say that I told you during the day that I could not suffer these insults much longer, and that you suppose that after you had gone to sleep I must have got up and either killed myself or in some way made my escape." ...|$|E

The fermented mixture is then distilled. The distilled product is colorless until it is aged in wooden barrels and other natural ingredients like caramel are added.|$|R
