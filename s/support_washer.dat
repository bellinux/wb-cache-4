40|$|The {{adsorption}} of ethane on semimicro Teflon-bonded, plat inum black {{fuel cell}} electrodes {{in the presence}} of I-IC 104 electrolyte is both mechanistically and kinetically similar to that on smooth plat inum after normalization to "real " (hydrogen adsorption) area. Polarization data obtained under the same conditions as the adsorption experiments allow a comparison of oxida-tion current with surface coverage over a range of potentials. Additional results obtained with methane and propane are also presented. The behavior of ethane on smooth plat inum micro-electrodes {{in the presence of}} a perchloric acid elec-trolyte has been investigated with the multipulse po-tentiodynamic (MPP) method in this Laboratory (1). This type of study has now been extended to fuel cell anodes of more complex structure. For this purpose a miniature version of a previously described (2) con-ducting-porous-Teflon fuel cell electrode (containing plat inum black as catalyst) has been employed. Particular attention has been given to the rates of adsorption and the nature of the species that form on the surface of the electrode. Both of these aspects have, in turn, been related to the over-al l polarization curve for the fuel electrode. Ethane has been the sub-ject of the most detailed investigation to date in order to obtain maximum correlation with the earlier work with the smooth microelectrodes. However, some work has also been done with several other fuels. Experimental The three-compartment, Teflon electrochemical cell is shown schematically in Fig. I. The anode, a minia-ture version of a fuel cell electrode, consisted of a 0. 20 cm diameter Teflon-bonded plat inum black elec-trode (2). This electrode, which was formed in the center of the thin (approximately 0. 012 cm) plat inum washer, was mounted horizontally in the cell, with connections for admitting fuel and venting products made from below.

25|$|In Valle de Etla, {{one group}} of {{indigenous}} residents has taken to collecting old tires found on the highway and have begun converting them into handcrafts. The craft idea began with Esteban Perada, originally from Santiago Suchilquitongo. Originally he used them to <b>support</b> <b>washers</b> and retaining walls and car bumpers. Getting creative, he {{found a way to}} convert a tire into a toucan design to hang flowerpots, painting it bright colors. Others liked it and requested the item for their gardens. Since then he and others have created other figures such as parrots, squirrels and more, selling enough to supplement family income.|$|R
40|$|Aluminum test {{cavities}} were manufactured with integral radial stems to <b>support</b> the <b>washers</b> of a B- 1 2500 MHz disk-and-washer Structure. Difficulties {{in making}} stem joints were therefore eliminated. From {{one to four}} integral stems were studied. Measurements showed that four stem support was best and that two stems mounted at 180 ” to each other created rf problems. The frequencies of higher order mode pass-bands can be shifted {{to result in a}} structure with good rf efficiency, coupling and quality factor for the n/ 2 operating mode...|$|R
50|$|The Eameses {{constantly}} {{made use}} of new materials. The pair's first plywood chair—the Eames Lounge Chair Wood (LCW)—{{made use of}} a heavy rubber washer glued to the backrest {{of the chair and}} screwed to the lumbar <b>support.</b> These <b>washers,</b> which have come to be called 'shock mounts', allow the backrest to flex slightly. This technology was brought back in the 670 Lounge chair. The backrest and headrest are screwed together by a pair of aluminum supports. This unit is suspended on the seat via two connection points in the armrests. The armrests are screwed to shock mounts which are connected only via glue to the interior of the backrest shell, allowing the backrest and headrest to flex when the chair is in use. This is part of the chair's unusual design, as well as its weakest link. The shock mounts have been known to tear free causing catastrophic collapse and damage.|$|R
40|$|The {{basic type}} of rock mass {{reinforcement}} method for both preparatory and operational workings in underground metal ore mines, both in Poland {{and in different}} countries across the world, is the expansion shell or adhesive-bonded rock bolt. The article discusses results of static loading test of the expansion shell rock bolts equipped with originally developed deformable component. This component consists of two profiled rock bolt washers, two disk springs, and three guide bars. The disk spring and disk washer material differs in stiffness. The construction materials ensure that at first the springs under loading are partially compressed, and then the rock bolt washer is plastically deformed. The rock bolts tested were installed in blocks simulating a rock mass with rock compressive strength of 80 MPa. The rock bolt was loaded statically until its ultimate loading capacity was exceeded. The study presents the results obtained under laboratory conditions in the test rig allowing testing of the rock bolts at their natural size, as used in underground metal ore mines. The stress-strain/displacement characteristics of the expansion shell rock bolt with the deformable component were determined experimentally. The relationships between the geometric parameters and specific strains or displacements of the bolt rod were described, and the percentage contribution of those values in total displacements, resulting from the deformation of rock bolt <b>support</b> components (<b>washer,</b> thread) and the expansion shell head displacements, were estimated. The stiffness of the yielded and stiff bolts was empirically determined, including stiffness parameters of every individual part (deformable component, steel rod). There were two phases of displacement observed during the static tension of the rock bolt which differed in their intensity...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION An {{electron}} linac[2] {{has been}} {{installed at the}} Accelerator Laboratory, Institute for Chemical Research, Kyoto University. It is mainly intended as the injector for the electron storage ring KSR [3, 4], which is being assembled. The discloaded wave-guides are installed as the accelerator tubes, which are operated at 2857 MHz. Because of the limited space in the building, only three of 3 -m accelerator tubes can be installed. The available RF power from a klystron is up to 20 MW for each tube, and then the output electron energy {{is expected to be}} about 100 MeV at the peak current of 100 mA. In order to have a shorter damping time in the storage ring, however, the higher injection energy is desirable. A new accelerating tube with a higher shunt impedance is thus required to achieve the higher accelerating gradient with the same input RF power. A cold model made of Aluminum is fabricated to study the possibility of a DAW structure with biperiodic <b>washer</b> <b>supports.</b> The r...|$|R
