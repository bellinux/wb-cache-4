40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} {{the need for}} a future EU <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> policy, by providing robust recommendations for future research priorities. A four stage approach was adopted: an initial analysis of the drivers of <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> research, primary (e. g. global challenges and societal needs) and secondary ones (e. g. legislation and European policies); an assessment of current <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> research priorities leading to identification of future research objectives. A technology gap analysis then mapped out an agenda for future EU <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> research needs, making use of the results of <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> research projects, co-funded by the EC DG Research and Innovation...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} unblock major {{transport}} routes {{and to ensure}} sustainable mobility, the changing of freight road to rail or <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> is an European Union objective. The increasing seaborne transport, the growing process of containerization and building an infrastructure for regular maritime lines and increasing Short Sea Shipping draws a scene with maritime sector of companies of major size, as a result, in many occasions, of mergers and acquisitions.

40|$|AbstractIn recent years, <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> {{operators}} (i. e. port operators, shipping {{lines and}} freight forwarders) have been {{faced with a}} rapidly changing business environment. As a result of this, they {{have been forced to}} make complex decisions in ways {{that will allow them to}} effectively respond to these environmental challenges. This paper attempts to examine which environmental challenges <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> operators consider to be most serious, and tries to determine what resource may help the <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> operators to successfully cope with these dynamic environmental challenges. Drawing from key theories and practices in strategic management, this paper suggests that knowledge resource would be a key resource that may help <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> operators to survive in the dynamic marketplace. A case analysis which targets Korean <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> companies is conducted in order to empirically examine the effectiveness of knowledge resource, in both reducing environmental uncertainty and in helping companies to flexibly respond to the environmental challenges with which they are faced. Following this, propositions for maritime operators will be then suggested...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how policy governing the liner shipping sector affects <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> costs and seaborne trade flows. The paper uses a novel data set and finds that restrictions, particularly on foreign investment, increase <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> costs, strongly but unevenly. The cost-inflating effect ranges from 24 to 50 percent and trade on some routes may be inhibited altogether. Distance increases <b>maritime</b> <b>transport</b> costs, but also attenuates the cost impact of policy barriers. Overall, policy restrictions may lower trade flows on specific routes {{by up to}} 46 percent and therefore deserve greater attention in national reform programs and international trade negotiations...|$|R
