5|$|For the 12-month period ending January 1, 2009, {{the airport}} had 163,984 {{aircraft}} operations, {{an average of}} 449 per day: 44% air taxi, 18% general aviation, 37% scheduled commercial, and 1% military. There are 92 aircraft based at this airport: 46% <b>single</b> <b>engine,</b> 16% multi-engine, 37% jet aircraft, and 1% helicopters.|$|E
5|$|Further {{proposals}} {{based on}} the delta wing resulted in {{two versions of the}} design known as C104: the <b>single</b> <b>engine</b> C104/4 and twin-engined C104/2. The designs were otherwise similar, using a low-mounted delta-wing; the primary advantages of the C104/2 were a larger overall size which offered a much larger internal weapons bay, at the time a cutting-edge feature in a fighter, and gave it twin-engine reliability. The proposals were submitted to the RCAF in June 1952.|$|E
5|$|Jessica Whitney Dubroff (May 5, 1988 – April 11, 1996) was {{a seven-year-old}} girl who died while {{attempting}} to become the youngest person to fly a light utility aircraft across the United States. On day-two of her quest, the Cessna 177B Cardinal <b>single</b> <b>engine</b> propeller aircraft, piloted by her flight instructor, crashed during a rainstorm immediately after takeoff from Cheyenne Regional Airport in Cheyenne, Wyoming, killing Dubroff, her 57-year-old father, and her flight instructor.|$|E

5|$|His {{military}} training began on 6 April 1936 at the 2nd Air Warfare School (Luftkriegsschule 2) at Gatow, on the south-western outskirts of Berlin. He swore the National Socialist {{oath of allegiance}} on 21 April 1936. Flight training began on Monday, 7 August 1936 at Gatow. His first flight was in a Heinkel He 72 Kadet D-EYZA <b>single</b> <b>engine</b> biplane. Lent logged his first solo flight on 15 September 1936 in a Focke-Wulf Fw 44 Stieglitz. By this time, Lent had accumulated 63 flights in his logbook. In conjunction with flight training, the students also learned to drive motorcycles and cars and during one of these training exercises, Lent {{was involved in a}} road accident, breaking his upper leg badly enough to prevent him from flying for five months. This did not adversely affect his classroom training and on 1 April 1937, after taking his commission examination, he was promoted to Fähnrich. On 19 October 1937 Lent completed his flight training and was awarded the A/B License. He earned his wings on 15 November 1937. On 1 February 1938, he was promoted to Oberfähnrich (first ensign), and on 1 March 1938 to Leutnant. By this time, he had made 434 flights in eight different types of aircraft and had accumulated 112 hours and 48 minutes flying time, mostly in daylight flights, in <b>single</b> <b>engine</b> training aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In November 1962, Rolls-Royce {{offered a}} PCB-equipped {{vectored}} thrust twin-Spey design {{as an alternative}} to the BS100. This alternative engine arrangement was widely seen as inferior, particularly due to the danger posed by asymmetric thrust output if a <b>single</b> <b>engine</b> failure occurred; however, Rolls-Royce claimed that their solution could be available sooner than the BS100 would be. In December 1962, Bristol performed the first successful run of a PCB-equipped Pegasus 2 engine. In order to perform a vertical takeoff, the use of PCB was necessitated; however, this feature would have come at the cost of significant ground erosion during operations.|$|E
5|$|The Comet had a {{total of}} four {{hydraulic}} systems, two primaries, one secondary, and a final emergency system for basic functions such as lowering the undercarriage. The undercarriage could also be lowered by a combination of gravity and a hand-pump. Power was syphoned from all four engines for the hydraulics, cabin air conditioning, and the de-icing system; these systems had operational redundancy in that they could keep working even if only a <b>single</b> <b>engine</b> was active. The majority of hydraulic components were centred in a single avionics bay. A pressurised refuelling system, developed by Flight Refuelling Ltd, allowed the Comet's fuel tanks to be refuelled at a far greater rate than other methods.|$|E

5|$|The {{first two}} blocks of JF-17 {{is powered by}} a single Russian RD-93 {{turbofan}} engine, which is a variant of the RD-33 engine used on the MiG-29 fighter. The engine gives more thrust and significantly lower specific fuel consumption than turbojet engines fitted to older combat aircraft being replaced by the JF-17. The advantages of using a <b>single</b> <b>engine</b> are a reduction in maintenance time and cost when compared to twin-engined fighters. A thrust-to-weight ratio of 0.99 can be achieved with full internal fuel tanks and no external payload. The engine's air supply is provided by two bifurcated air inlets (see airframe section).|$|E
5|$|The {{pre-production}} Griffon I {{shared the}} R engine's bore and stroke, but was otherwise {{a completely new}} design that first ran in the Experimental Department in November 1939. Although this <b>single</b> <b>engine</b> was never flown, the production version, the Griffon II, first flew in 1941 installed in the Fairey Firefly. A {{significant difference between the}} R and the production Griffon was the re-location of the camshaft and supercharger drives {{to the front of the}} engine to reduce overall length. Another length-reducing measure was the use of a single magneto (the R had two, mounted at the rear), this again was moved to the front of the engine.|$|E
5|$|After her refit was {{completed}} on 18 January 1944, Steinbrinck {{and her sister}} Theodor Riedel spent {{the first half of}} the year laying minefields at the entrance to the Skaggerak and escorting convoys to and from Norway. On 3 May the ship passed through the Kiel Canal en route to Hamburg for a lengthy refit. While in the dockyard, she was struck by a bomb in the diesel generator room on 18 June. Despite the extent of the damage, the dockyard reported that her refit would be completed as scheduled on 20 November. On 4 November another bomb detonated alongside Steinbrinck and caused extensive flooding and shock damage from the explosion. The ship was patched up and towed to Wesermünde for more thorough repairs, but her completion was seriously delayed. By 1 April 1945, only a <b>single</b> <b>engine</b> was operable and the Kriegsmarine made the decision to strip her crew for combat duties ashore after she was moved to Cuxhaven. She was still there in May when the Germans surrendered.|$|E

50|$|Longer trains {{with more}} wheels have better conductivity. Short trains or <b>single</b> <b>engines</b> {{can be a}} problem. Trains with a single Budd railmotor, which are also lightweight, and with discbrakes, had some {{problems}} when they stopped, and {{had to make a}} double stop to ensure good contact with the rails.|$|R

5|$|The Meteorological Flight {{first came}} into being on 1 November 1924. Its main {{priority}} was identifying temperature, pressure, humidity and general weather conditions being logged at sea level to 18,000 feet. These flights were named THUM (Temperature/Humidity). Changes in air conditions usually came in the Atlantic in the west. The Meteorological Office (MET) relied on reports from ships in this regard. The need for aircraft for operations was ignored in 1939 owing to lack of aircraft. However, in June 1940, Bomber Command started to become anxious about base landing conditions and the accuracy of general forecasts. In response from strong support, No. 403 Squadron RAF, No. 404 Squadron RAF and No. 405 Squadron RAF were formed for this purpose. The routes requested by the MET usually involved distances of up to 1,000nm. Hudsons were ideal for this operation, but since none were available Bristol Blenheims filled the role. On 1 March 1941 Coastal Command assumed operational control of all the units. They were redesignated No. 1401 to 1406 flights. All were handed over to No. 18 Group RAF. In October 1940, two more flights, 1407 and 1408 were sent to Iceland to begin operations from there. Several types of <b>single</b> <b>engine</b> aircraft were used; Gloster Gladiators, Hawker Hurricanes and Supermarine Spitfires. Operations were conducted mostly up to 15,000 feet in wartime as the aneroid capsule altimeter {{was not able to}} give accurate readings. A Mk. 14B ICAN altimeter was used. The aircraft had to be flown at the height measured for two minutes to allow the readings to settle or stabilise.|$|E

50|$|Further {{information}} {{was published in}} Today's Railways for March 2016. Three different options are now being considered. These are: two main <b>engines,</b> a <b>single</b> main <b>engine,</b> or a <b>single</b> main <b>engine</b> plus an auxiliary engine. It is expected that a re-engined Class 56 would cost around £1.8 million, compared to £3 million for a new locomotive.|$|R

50|$|Phelon & Moore also {{produced}} {{a range of}} lightweight machines, also generally carrying the name Panther or Red Panther, using their own four-stroke <b>single</b> <b>engines</b> and Villiers two-stroke engines. The Red Panther was famous for being the cheapest complete bike available in the thirties, priced at a fraction under £30. In 1934 a 250 cc Red Panther won the Maudes Trophy.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{enactment}} of the 1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system, the HU2K-1 was redesignated UH-2A and the HU2K-1U was redesignated UH-2B. In service, the UH-2 Seasprite would see several modifications and improvements, such as the addition of fixtures for mounting external stores. Beginning in 1968, the Navy's remaining UH-2s were extensively remanufactured, their <b>single</b> <b>engines</b> being replaced by a twin-engine arrangement.|$|R
