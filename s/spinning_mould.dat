40|$|Abstract—Ductile iron Pipes are casted by Horizontal {{centrifugal}} {{process in which}} liquid iron is filled through an open channel into a fast rotating mould that is slightly tilted. The mould is water cooled from outside. In order to distribute the metal, the <b>spinning</b> <b>mould</b> including its cooling system is shifted axially in a controlled movement. The quality of ductile iron pipe largely depends on microstructure as well as mechanical properties like Ferrite %, Carbide %, Elongation % and Hardness. These can be improved by analyze and optimize the process parameters during the casting process. In this research paper, Design of Experiment (DOE) based Taguchi Method is used to analyze and optimize the parameters like Pouring molten metal Temperature, Inoculation Quantity and inlet cooling water flow rate. By using Taguchi Method L 16 orthogonal array is generated in MINITAB 17 and responses are analyzed by experimental work {{at different levels of}} factors. From S/N ratio the best combination of parameters are analyzed by which the predicted Taguchi result is generated. The confirmation experimental test is done and predicted result is compared with actual results. Also the Significance of factors and interactions of parameters are analyzed by Analysis of variance (ANOVA). By performing all this an attempt has made to analyze and optimize the parameters to improve the pipe quality and its life by supplying optimized resources...|$|E

40|$|A {{research}} and development {{effort was made to}} investigate the feasibility of rapid tooling for zinc spin casting using stereolithography (SL) and arc metal spray technologies. The study is based on a specific practical case where intermediate tooling processes are required to make an intermediate tool from the SL pattern. The intermediate tool is then used in an arc metal spray process to form a metal master tool that is subsequently used to make <b>spin</b> casting <b>moulds.</b> Different materials and processes were studied to fabricate the intermediate tools. It shows that ceramics, used in investment casting and Shaw process, are suitable materials for the intermediate tools required to make the metal master tools. A preliminary analysis of the dimensional errors confirms the viability of the proposed tooling process chain...|$|R
40|$|The {{fabrication}} and {{the property}} {{investigation of the}} hybrid nanocomposite material made of poly[2 -methoxy- 5 -(2 ′-ethyl-hexyloxy) - 1, 4 -phenylene vinylene] (MEH-PPV) polymer and Y 3 Al 5 O 12 :Ce (YAG:Ce) with the relative weight ratio of 1 [*]:[*] 1 in order to apply for optoelectronic devices are reported. Thermal analysis showed the hybrid material’s deterioration or decomposition when the temperature exceeded 200 °C under inert gas atmosphere. Rheological measurement concluded that the material solution {{can be used for}} <b>spinning</b> or soft <b>moulding</b> lithography making large- or flexible substrate surface. Optical properties of the hybrid material are investigated. The effect of thermal treatment on the optical properties showed that, at 180 °C under inert gas environment, the optical properties were enhanced. An MEH-PPV/YAG:Ce hybrid nanocomposite converted LED lamp was fabricated showing that the hybrid material is suitable as conversion material for white LED fabrication...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} rapid {{solidification}} on the microstructure of Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloys with 8 wt. % Zn- 2 wt. % Mg- 2. 3 wt. % Cu and 0. 2 or 0. 5 wt. % of Zr additions were investigated using X-ray diffraction measurements (XRD), scanning (SEM) and {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM) combined with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) microanalysis. Rapidly solidified ribbons with thickness of 70 - 100 µm were performed by melt <b>spinning</b> technique. The <b>mould</b> cast alloys {{as well as the}} melt spun ribbons revealed dendritic microstructure of α(Al) solid solution and η Mg(Zn,Cu) 2 phase in interdendritic areas. The refinement of the microstructure and reduction of the volume fraction of the η phase up to 1. 7 %, as compared to 4 % in the mould cast alloys was observed in the ribbons. Copper dissolution up to about 20 wt % in the η phase causes a decrease of the lattice parameters. The Al 3 Zr primary precipitates were observed in the mould cast alloy containing 0. 5 wt % of Zr while in the ribbons all zirconium dissolved in the aluminium solid solution...|$|R
40|$|Fluorescent solar {{collectors}} are cheap plates made generally of glass or plastic that is doped with fluorescent molecules. Fluorescence {{can be used}} to trap incident solar radiation in order to concentrate light and also to shift the radiation to wavelengths converted at higher efficiencies. This project investigates both these aspects. Solar concentration using fluorescent {{solar collectors}} is examined for different combinations of solar cells and mirrors coupled to different surfaces of fluorescent solar collectors. The effects of the fabrication method i. e. <b>spin</b> coating or <b>moulding</b> is also studied. Modelling of the fluorescence re-absorption is the key to obtain the efficiency of such systems and these models will be shown to be useful in the optimisation of certain configurations of fluorescent collectors that behave like ideal models. On comparison with experimental results these models {{can also be used to}} quantify and identify losses in configurations that suffer additional losses. Devices tested in the lab are estimated to have the potential to achieve power conversion efficiencies close to 4 % while results of optimisation results indicate possible further improvements. Angular resolved measurements of the fluorescence exiting the fluorescent solar collector edge is also used to study the photon transport of light within these devices. The combination of solar concentration and wavelength shifting (to wavelengths with superior solar cell performance) has been exploited for application to cadmium telluride solar cells for the first time. The theory of operation of these devices is used to model the current output measured experimentally. Novel photonic-based structures that incorporate fluorescent molecules within one-dimensional photonic crystals has also been fabricated and characterised. It will be shown that these devices have the potential to reduce fundamental loss mechanisms found in conventional fluorescent solar collectors by suppressing and reducing emission within loss cones and tuning emission reaching the solar cells to certain wavelengths. The theory of operation of these devices will used to describe the propagation of light within the structure and explain the experimentally measured emission characteristics. The maximum theoretical efficiencies of photonic-based fluorescent solar collectors have also been derived and adapted from previous work to show the potential of such devices...|$|R
