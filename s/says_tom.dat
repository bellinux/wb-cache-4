500|$|Tom's {{electricity}} is cut off, and he weeps. A shaven Migg, wearing clean clothes, enters the house. He {{has started a}} job, working with children, and gives Tom Â£40 because Tom has [...] "done so much" [...] for Migg. Migg wants {{to take over the}} tenancy on the flat until Tom's benefits come in. He walks into the bathroom to get into the bath as Gerri walks in and comforts Tom, who asks her not to leave. Gerri tells Tom that he has invented Migg to cope with what has been happening. She <b>says</b> <b>Tom</b> is depressed and has had a nervous breakdown. The pair head into the bathroom, but there is no Migg. Gerri tells Tom to [...] "get this Migg out of [...] head once and for all". She leaves, and Migg emerges from a hiding place; he asks if everything is alright.|$|E

6000|$|... "'What has she got?' <b>says</b> <b>Tom.</b> 'Wal, folks {{might say}} none o' my bisness; but I s'pects it'll turn out some o' my bisness, and yourn too, if he don't look sharp arter it,' <b>says</b> <b>Tom.</b> 'It's no good, that 'are box ain't.' ...|$|E
60|$|Now, was not Mother Carey's a {{wonderful}} story? And, I {{am happy to}} <b>say,</b> <b>Tom</b> believed it every word.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come back, McGovery, and don't be a fool. Father Cullen's gone to Dromod. I think I {{heard him}} <b>say</b> <b>Tom</b> Ginty wanted him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I reckon maybe that's so. Who'd 'a' thought such a thing? But <b>say,</b> <b>Tom,</b> now's {{a mighty}} {{good time to}} get that box, if Injun Joe's drunk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Guess ye'll find out, darn ye,' <b>says</b> <b>Tom</b> Tooth-acre. 'So, ye wanted our ship, did ye? Wal, ye jest can't {{have our}} ship,' <b>says</b> <b>Tom,</b> says he; and I {{tell you he}} jest run that 'are fellow up stairs lickety-split, for Tom was strong as a giant.|$|E
6000|$|... "There, Ned," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Tom,</b> {{coming down}} the stairs, [...] "I've found out just what mother wants, without telling her a word about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You seem {{to partake}} of her infirmity, sir," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Tom,</b> {{with a smile and}} a bow. [...] "However, it is one which does you both honour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, look here!" [...] {{burst out}} Stanley, striding forward. [...] "Do {{you mean to}} <b>say,</b> <b>Tom</b> Rover, that you put that cap on the old well on purpose?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, sir. I should <b>say</b> <b>Tom</b> Tring {{would be}} as good a man as one could get at the job. What is the money to be, Mr. Thorndyke?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bashi-fiddles! I <b>say,</b> <b>Tom,</b> {{the more}} I think over it, {{the more it}} won't do. It's {{throwing}} yourself away. They say that Turkish contingent is getting on terribly ill." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{a member}} of the College of Surgeons," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Tom,</b> {{recovering}} his coolness, [...] "and have just been dining with Mr. Armsworth. I suppose you know him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Wal,' <b>says</b> <b>Tom,</b> 'ef that 'are ain't a British naval officer, I lose my bet. I've {{been used}} to the ways on 'em, and I knows their build and their step.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What ducks of hounds those are!" [...] <b>says</b> <b>Tom,</b> trying, for ulterior purposes, to ingratiate himself. [...] "How {{they are}} working there all by themselves, like so many human beings. Perfect!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{all well}} enough to <b>say,</b> <b>Tom.</b> But just the same I haven't any right to stand in her light. I haven't got any such money to offer her as this millionaire----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] Frank exclaimed, {{with a look}} {{of immense}} surprise, [...] "you don't mean to <b>say,</b> <b>Tom,</b> you're going to turn your back upon a volcano--and in actual eruption, too, into the bargain!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>say,</b> <b>Tom,</b> what's that {{up in the}} sky?" [...] said Captain Harvey suddenly, {{after they}} had been driving {{for a couple of}} hours. [...] "It's the strangest looking thing I ever did see." ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"You don't mean to say," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Tom,</b> {{doing as}} he was told and giving him back the paper, [...] "that I'm to wait here long, do you? It's a {{precious}} dismal place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I'll be eat if you dines off me,' <b>says</b> <b>Tom,</b> [...] 'Yes, that,' says I, 'you'll be,'-- [...] 'I'm boiled if I die, my friend,' quoth I, [...] And 'Exactly so,' quoth he.|$|E
6000|$|... '"I think I have," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Tom</b> - Tom was one {{of those}} who can persuade {{themselves}} to anything they like - [...] "I've often thought I wasn't the small beer I was taken for." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, lads, {{take your}} {{places at the}} sheets, ready to haul or let go as I give the word." [...] So <b>saying,</b> <b>Tom</b> Virtue took {{his place in the}} bow, holding on by the forestay.|$|R
50|$|The Say Papers, edited in the Monthly Repository, 1809-10, by Robert Aspland, {{were from}} manuscripts {{then in the}} {{possession}} of Say's grandson, Samuel <b>Say</b> <b>Toms.</b> Among them was a petition from Sophia, widow of Alexander Selkirk.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>say,</b> <b>Tom,</b> a fool and {{his money}} are soon parted. There's a five-pound note for him, you begging, insinuating dog, and be hanged to you both! I shall {{die in the}} workhouse at this rate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, then, you've got to {{come with}} me," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Tom,</b> heartily. [...] "It isn't too late, and they'll want you. I've a buggy, and I'm going to the Russells' to change my clothes. Come along!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "''Cause I {{think she}} wants lookin' arter,' <b>says</b> <b>Tom.</b> 'What's more,' says he, 'if the cap'n don't look sharp arter her the devil 'll have us all afore mornin.' I tell ye, Sam, there's {{mischief}} under them petticuts.' ...|$|E
60|$|Lord, sir, <b>says</b> <b>Tom,</b> not I, {{they are}} mad, I think; I {{have nothing to}} say to them; I care not where I go, not I; I will go round the globe with you, it's all one to me.|$|E
60|$|So <b>saying,</b> <b>Tom</b> went upstairs, {{where he}} {{repeated}} to Peter, {{who was still}} awake, his conversation with his aunt, and the two went into shouts of laughter over the idea of Sam making love to the prim Hannah.|$|R
6000|$|... "They <b>say</b> <b>Tom</b> Fetjen went up {{the coast}} to Upernivik," [...] said Rooney, after the interview. [...] "If your ship is bound for that port, you'll {{probably}} find him there. He owns a boat called the Northland, a little two-master." ...|$|R
6000|$|Well, I let go all holts then, like I was shot. It was {{the most}} {{astonishing}} speech I ever heard--and I'm bound to <b>say</b> <b>Tom</b> Sawyer fell considerable in my estimation. Only I couldn't believe it. Tom Sawyer a NIGGER-STEALER! ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"Sir," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Tom,</b> [...] "before {{we proceed}} any further, {{will you have}} the {{goodness}} to inform me who this young Salamander" [...] - Tom called him that for aggravation, you perceive, gentlemen - [...] "who this young Salamander may be?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... '"Very good," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Tom,</b> with a mournful air. [...] "It's {{only for}} two months, but I {{may as well}} be the richest man in the world even for that time. I'm not particular, I'll take her, Sir. I'll take her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hate and}} detest him," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Tom,</b> moodily wavering. [...] "Still, he is a brave man." [...] Then he calls out, [...] "Sergeant Drooce, Sergeant Drooce! Tell me you have driven me too hard, and are sorry for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can {{understand}} what you <b>say,</b> <b>Tom,</b> for I feel exactly as you do. The question is, how is the matter to be arranged?" [...] Then he broke into French, which the archer by this time understood well enough, though he could speak it but poorly.|$|R
6000|$|... "What do you <b>say,</b> <b>Tom,</b> {{if we go}} down to {{the river}} and have a swim?" [...] {{proposed}} Sam, the next morning. It was an unusually hot day, and the thought of getting into the cool water of the old swimming hole appealed strongly to the youth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, that's {{all very}} fine to <b>SAY,</b> <b>Tom</b> Sawyer, but {{how in the}} nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don't {{know how to do}} it to them? --that's the thing I want to get at. Now, what do you reckon it is?" ...|$|R
