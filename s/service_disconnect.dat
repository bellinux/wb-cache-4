Notice that the subpanel is fed by two large hot wires and a neutral wire running through a small angled conduit. This configuration appears to display three violations of the current U.S. National Electric Code: the main panel {{does not have a}} grounding conductor(here it is fed through the subpanel instead), the connection between the main and subpanel lacks a grounding conductor (it must have 4 instead of 3 wires), and the subpanel neutral bar is bonded to the ground bar (these should be separate bars after the first <b>service</b> <b>disconnect,</b> which in this case is the main panel).|$|E

The scenario envisions a number of homogeneous peers {{that are able to}} provide the same <b>services,</b> <b>disconnect</b> frequently from the net, and perform part of their work while disconnected. In these contexts the absence of a host is not the exceptional case, but rather the normal behavior. Thus, a traditional architecture based on a central repository exposes the system to failures when the server is unavailable. Instead, we build our system on a peer-to-peer middleware able to provide the abstraction of global virtual data structure, i. e., a data structure composed by all the data actually connected in a given instant. Thanks to this, we can exploit the service provided by the network even if relevant hosts are disconnected...|$|R

A prototype disconnect was designed and tested, based on criteria formulated from a survey of expected usage requirements for orbital servicing concepts. Testing involved the comparison of three seal materials (EPR, Neoprene and Teflon), and two test media (helium and Freon 21), and was conducted over a temperature range of - 150 F to + 225 F. Results indicate low helium leakage (10 to the - 4 power sccs) and extremely low engagement forces (56 lb sub f). Testing was also performed on a new seal design.

40|$|Title {{from first}} page of PDF file (viewed January 13, 2011) Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 76 - 77) IEEE 802. 15. 4 -based Home Automation Networks for demand-side energy management come {{at a time when}} other standards for wireless home automation are becoming ubiquitous. Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN) is capable of providing low-cost, easily available home automation infrastructure, and hence it's natural for IEEE 802. 15. 4 to well integrate into HAN (Home Area Network) energy management applications as well. These Ad-hoc home automation networks let homeowners and utility companies to communicate in real time and manage energy consumption collaboratively, especially during times of peak demand. This research proposes a self-configuring, self-healing and easy-to-deploy home area network architecture that enables demand-side energy management. In such an infrastructure network, appliances can be dynamically added in the network in ad-hoc fashion and continue to communicate with Home Area Controller. This enables the collection and distribution of power consumption information to home users and the utility companies for time-of-day pricing information, demand-response actions, and remote <b>service</b> <b>disconnects.</b> Utilities can save significant amount of resources by not having to build new power generation plants and avoid CO 2 emissions. Additionally, homeowners can benefit by lowering bills and gain ability to monitor and control the energy usage to avoid rolling blackouts...|$|R
