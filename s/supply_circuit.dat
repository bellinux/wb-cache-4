5000|$|While as of July 2016 it is {{not known}} if the {{propulsion}} system is still called KTDU-80, it has been significantly modified. While previously the system had 16 high thrust DPO-B and six low thrust DPO-M in one propellant <b>supply</b> <b>circuit</b> and six other low thrust DPO-M on a different circuit, now all 28 thrusters are high thrust DPO-B, arranged in 14 pairs. Each propellant <b>supply</b> <b>circuit</b> handles 14 DPO-B, with each element of each thruster pair being fed by a different circuit. This provides full fault tolerance for thruster or propellant circuit failure. The new arrangement adds fault tolerance for docking and undocking with one failed thruster or de-orbit with two failed thrusters. Also, the number of DPO-B in the aft section has been doubled to eight, improving the de-orbit fault tolerance.|$|E

25|$|As an {{inrush current}} limiter device in power <b>supply</b> <b>circuits,</b> they present a higher {{resistance}} initially, which prevents large currents from flowing at turn-on, and then heat up and become much lower resistance to allow higher current flow during normal operation.

50|$|A direct on line starter {{can be used}} if {{the high}} inrush current of the motor does not cause {{excessive}} voltage drop in the <b>supply</b> <b>circuit.</b> The maximum size of a motor allowed on a direct on line starter may be limited by the supply utility for this reason. For example, a utility may require rural customers to use reduced-voltage starters for motors larger than 10 kW.|$|E
50|$|One common kind of {{decoupling}} is {{to protect}} a powered circuit from signals in the power supply. Sometimes, for various reasons, a power supply supplies an AC signal superimposed on the DC power line. Such a signal is often undesirable in the powered circuit. A decoupling capacitor can prevent the powered circuit from seeing that signal, thus decoupling it from that aspect of the power <b>supply</b> <b>circuit.</b>|$|E

50|$|In the 1970s, Robert Carver {{designed}} and produced several high quality high-powered audio amplifiers, calling them magnetic amplifiers.

50|$|Dry steam is {{saturated}} steam {{that has been}} very slightly superheated. This {{is not sufficient to}} change its energy appreciably, but is a sufficient rise in temperature to avoid condensation problems, given the average loss in temperature across the steam <b>supply</b> <b>circuit.</b> Towards the end of the 19th century, when superheating was still a less-than-certain technology, such steam-drying gave the condensation-avoiding benefits of superheating without requiring the sophisticated boiler or lubrication techniques of full superheating.|$|E

Most of these used a transformerless power <b>supply</b> <b>circuit.</b> In American radio receivers with transformer power supplies, built from about 1940-1950, the 6V6, 6V6G, 6V6GT and miniature 6AQ5 beam tetrodes were very commonly used.|$|E
50|$|In electronics, a bleeder {{resistor}} is {{a resistor}} {{connected in parallel}} with the output of a high-voltage power <b>supply</b> <b>circuit</b> {{for the purpose of}} discharging the electric charge stored in the power supply's filter capacitors when the equipment is turned off, for safety reasons. It eliminates the possibility of a leftover charge causing electric shock if personnel handle or service the equipment in the off state, believing it is safe. A bleeder resistor is usually a standard resistor rather than a specialized component.|$|E

50|$|Phantom {{powering}} is {{not always}} implemented correctly or adequately, even in professional-quality preamps, mixers, and recorders. In part this is because first-generation (late-1960s through mid-1970s) 48-volt phantom-powered condenser microphones had simple circuitry and required only small amounts of operating current (typically less than 1 mA per microphone), so the phantom <b>supply</b> <b>circuits</b> typically built into recorders, mixers, and preamps of that time were designed {{on the assumption that}} this current would be adequate. The original DIN 45596 phantom-power specification called for a maximum of 2 mA. This practice has carried forward to the present; many 48-volt phantom power <b>supply</b> <b>circuits,</b> especially in low-cost and portable equipment, simply cannot supply more than 1 or 2 mA total without breaking down. Some circuits also have significant additional resistance in series with the standard pair of supply resistors for each microphone input; this may not affect low-current microphones much, but it can disable microphones that need more current.|$|R

50|$|Until the mass-market {{introduction}} of fuel injection, the industry's remedy for dieseling was to install an electric solenoid into the fuel <b>supply</b> <b>circuit</b> of the carburetor, energized by the ignition coil primary wire: when activated, the solenoid would open and allow fuel to flow normally {{out of the}} float bowl, through the fuel-metering jets and into the engine; when deactivated, the solenoid would close and prevent fuel from being drawn through the jets and into the engine. This provided a simple, adequate solution to the dieseling problem.|$|E
50|$|The HT <b>supply</b> <b>circuit</b> most {{commonly}} provides a positive voltage of some hundreds of volts to the anode (or plate) and in later circuits {{also to the}} screen grid, with the cathode running at near ground or chassis potential. The main exception to {{this was in the}} case of tubes with water-cooled anodes, once used for radio transmission, electric furnaces and similar applications. These tubes used a negative HT supply to the cathode, so that the anode could run near ground DC potential (but typically at many hundreds of volts of RF).|$|E
50|$|In {{standard}} regulated monopoly markets, electricity rates typically vary for residential, {{commercial and}} industrial customers. Prices for any single class of electricity customer can vary by time-of-day or by the capacity or nature of the <b>supply</b> <b>circuit</b> (e.g., 5 kW, 12 kW, 18 kW, 24 kW are typical {{in some of the}} large developed countries); for industrial customers, single-phase vs. 3-phase, etc. If a specific market allows real-time dynamic pricing, a more recent option typically following the introduction of electronic metering, prices can even vary between times of low and high electricity demand.|$|E
50|$|Even with noisy sources, like motors, {{the total}} {{harmonic}} distortion (THD) of a grid-connected circuit is generally unmeasurable due to the essentially infinite capacity of the grid that filters these events out. Inverters, on the other hand, generally have much larger distortions, as much as 5% THD. This {{is a function of}} their construction; some THD is a natural side-effect of the switched-mode power <b>supply</b> <b>circuits</b> most inverters are based on.|$|R

50|$|Work {{must be done}} on {{the charges}} by some source of energy in the device, to make them move toward the {{positive}} terminal against the electric field, so conservation of energy requires that negative static resistances have a source of power. The power may come from an internal source which converts some other form of energy to electric power as in a battery or generator, or from a separate connection to an external power <b>supply</b> <b>circuit</b> as in an amplifying device like a transistor, vacuum tube, or op amp.|$|E
50|$|Tubes are {{essentially}} obsolete for most applications, while the transistors and thyristors have significant limitations including that they cannot simultaneously control the maximum voltage, the effective voltage, and the maximum current of a non-linear load in a Direct AC (rectified but unfiltered) <b>supply</b> <b>circuit.</b> The benistor overcomes these shortcomings because, unlike the transistor and thyristor, it has separate control terminals for simultaneously managing {{the amount of}} current, maximum voltage, and effective voltage in an AC generator-load circuit, by means of either linear switching and/or self-switching mode of operations.|$|E
50|$|For a 208 VAC {{emergency}} supply system, a central battery system with automatic controls, {{located in the}} power station building, is used to avoid long electric supply wires.
