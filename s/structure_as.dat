5|$|Although {{the winds}} rapidly {{decreased}} after landfall, the storm maintained a well-defined <b>structure</b> <b>as</b> it crossed from Mozambique into Zimbabwe late on February22. Weakening to tropical depression status, Eline crossed Zimbabwe and maintained its circulation, entering Botswana on February24. Three days later, the center drifted into eastern Namibia {{and turned to}} the south, dissipating on February29. After the circulation dissipated, the residual system merged with a heat low and an approaching cold front.|$|E
5|$|At 3:00a.m., the paramilitaries {{demolished}} the Roman Catholic {{church of}} the Pilgrimage to the Blessed Virgin Mary in Voćin. They used the 550-year-old <b>structure</b> <b>as</b> an ammunition depot. In {{the wake of the}} explosion, a single wall of the structure remained standing. It is estimated that several tons of explosives were used for the purpose. At the same time, approximately 20 other Croat inhabitants of villages of Bokane, Krašković, Miokovićevo and Zvečevo, further to the south, were reportedly killed.|$|E
5|$|Damage to the {{crossing}} {{resulted in the}} closure of the QEW until a temporary bridge was erected. To remedy what was becoming a major delay and hazard, the Department of Highways began planning a high-level bridge to cross the shipping channel. To provide better access to the new <b>structure</b> <b>as</b> well as the proposed Chedoke Expressway, construction began on the Freeman Diversion, bypassing the old trumpet interchange and creating a new three-level stack. Work on both proceeded over the next six years.|$|E

5|$|Immobile Holliday junctions, with {{asymmetrical}} sequences that {{lock the}} strands {{in a specific}} position, were artificially created by scientists to study their <b>structure</b> <b>as</b> a model for natural Holliday junctions.
