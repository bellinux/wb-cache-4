NMP is rapidly biotransformed by hydroxylation to 5-hydroxy-N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, which is further oxidized to N-methylsuccinimide; this intermediate is further hydroxylated to 2-hydroxy-N-methylsuccinimide. These metabolites are all colourless. The excreted amounts of NMP metabolites in the urine after inhalation or oral intake represented about 100% and 65% of the administered doses, respectively. NMP has a low potential for skin irritation and a moderate potential for eye irritation in rabbits. Repeated daily doses of 450 mg/kg body weight administered to the skin caused painful and severe haemorrhage and eschar formation in rabbits. These adverse effects have not been seen in workers occupationally exposed to pure NMP, but they have been observed after dermal exposure to NMP used in cleaning processes.

40|$|Abstract: Allergic Contact Dermatitis (ACD) is {{a common}} work-related skin disease that often {{develops}} {{as a result of}} repetitive skin exposures to a sensitizing chemical agent. A variety of experimental tests have been suggested to assess the skin <b>sensitization</b> <b>potential.</b> We applied a method of Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) to relate measured and calculated physical-chemical properties of chemical compounds to their <b>sensitization</b> <b>potential.</b> Using statistical methods, each of these properties, called molecular descriptors, was tested for its propensity to predict the <b>sensitization</b> <b>potential.</b> A few of the most informative descriptors were subsequently selected to build a model of skin sensitization.

In principle, LLNA provides a standardized continuous scale suitable for quantitative assessment of skin sensitization. However, at present many LLNA results are still reported on a dichotomous scale, which is consistent with the scale of guinea pig tests, which were widely used in past years.

It can also circumvent ethical concern of using animals in toxicological tests, and reduce time and cost. Compounds with aniline or phenol moieties represent two large classes of frequently skin sensitizing chemicals but exhibiting very variable, and difficult to predict, potency. The mechanisms of action are not well-understood. Methods A group of mechanistically hard-to-be-classified aniline and phenol chemicals were collected. An in silico model was established by statistical analysis of quantum descriptors for the determination of the relationship between their chemical structures and skin <b>sensitization</b> <b>potential.</b> The sensitization mechanisms were investigated based on the features of the established model. Then the model was utilized to analyze a subset of FDA approved drugs containing aniline and/or phenol groups for prediction of their skin <b>sensitization</b> <b>potential.</b> Results and discussion A linear discriminant model using the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (ϵ HOMO) as the descriptor yielded high prediction accuracy. The contribution of ϵ HOMO as a major determinant may suggest that autoxidation or free radical binding could be involved.

BALB/c mice (n = 3 per concentration studied, three concentrations studied per metal) received three daily applications of the metal salt (in DMSO) on the dorsum of both ears.

Abstract: Type 1 {{diabetes}} mellitus is an autoimmune disorder of the endocrine pancreas that currently affects {{millions of people}} in the United States. Although the disease can be managed with exogenous insulin administration, the ultimate cure for the condition lies in restoring a patient’s ability to produce their own insulin. Islet cell allotransplantation provides a means of endogenous insulin production. Though far from perfected, islet transplants are now a proven treatment for type 1 diabetics. However, proper patient selection is critical for achieving optimal outcomes. Given the shortage of transplantable organs, selecting appropriate candidates for whom the procedure will be of greatest benefit is essential. Although many of those who receive islets do not retain insulin independence, grafts do {{play a significant role in}} preventing hypoglycemic episodes that can be quite detrimental to quality of life and potentially fatal. Additionally, islet transplant requires lifelong immunosuppression. Antibodies, both preformed and following islet infusion, may play important roles in graft outcomes. Finally, no procedure is without inherent risk and islet transfusions can have serious consequences for recipients’ livers in the form of both vascular and metabolic complications. Therefore, patient-specific factors that should be taken into account before islet transplantation include aims of therapy, <b>sensitization,</b> and <b>potential</b> increased risk for hepatic and portal-venous sequelae.

So we decided to investigate the prevalence of latex <b>sensitization</b> and <b>potential</b> risk factors among healthcare workers in a general hospital. In a cross sectional study by distributing a questionnaire among 876 employees of a general hospital, we investigated the prevalence of latex allergy and the potential risk factors for latex sensitization. We collected information about occupational history, including specific tasks performed, time of first exposure to latex, number of pairs of gloves used, and duration of weekly exposure. We also investigated the interval between first exposure and onset of symptoms. We asked about pre-existing rhinoconjuctivitis, asthma, atopic and contact dermatitis, hay fever, autoimmune diseases, and food allergies.

Stimulus–response functions (SRFs) to graded CRD (10 – 80 mmHg, 30 s) were constructed before and 30 min after ipsilateral injection of low pH (4. 0, 100 μl) saline into the somatic receptive fields. In some experiments, cervical (C 1 –C 2) spinalization was performed to eliminate supraspinal influence. The selective NMDA receptor antagonist CGS 19755 and AMPA receptor antagonist NBQX were injected (25 μmol kg− 1, i. v.) to examine their influence on sensitization. Three types of neurones were characterized as short-latency abrupt (SLA, n = 24), short latency sustained (SLS, n = 12), and long-latency (LL, n = 6) to CRD. Ipsilateral injection of low pH (4. 0) in the somatic receptive field, but not the contralateral gastrocnemius (GN) or front leg muscles, sensitized responses of these neurones to CRD.

Whilst these methods perform relatively well in predicting LLNA results, a concern raised is their ability to predict chemicals that need activation to be sensitizing (pre- or pro-haptens). This current study reviewed an EURL ECVAM dataset of 127 substances for which information was available in the LLNA and three non-animal test methods. Twenty eight of the sensitizers needed to be activated, with the majority being pre-haptens. These were correctly identified by 1 {{or more of the}} test methods. Six substances were categorized exclusively as pro-haptens, but were correctly identified by {{at least one of the}} cell-based assays.

40|$|Papain is {{commonly}} used in food, pharmaceutical, textile, and cosmetic industries and is known to induce occupational allergic asthma. We have previously shown that the papain-like cysteine protease Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus 1 from house dust mite exhibits percutaneous <b>sensitization</b> <b>potential.</b> We aimed here to investigate the potential of papain itself in epicutaneous sensitization. The effects of papain on tight junction (TJ) proteins were tested in vitro in human primary keratinocytes. Using C 57 BL/ 6 wild-type and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) -deficient mice, we analyzed the <b>sensitization</b> <b>potential</b> of papain, its effects on the skin barrier, and immune cell recruitment. Our results show that papain affects the skin barrier by increasing transepidermal water loss, degrading TJ proteins and inducing vasodilation. When topically applied, papain exhibited a high epicutaneous inflammatory potential by recruiting neutrophils, mast cells, and CD 3 -positive cells and by induction of a TH 2 -biased antibody response. However, its high potency for specific sensitization via the skin was TLR 4 independent and, {{in spite of its}} capacity to degrade epidermal TJ proteins, does not rely on its enzymatic function. From our data, we conclude that papain has all features to act as a strong allergen via the skin...|$|E
40|$|Insulin {{resistance}} is the defining {{feature of the}} metabolic syndrome and the primary defect leading to type 2 diabetes. Insulin {{resistance is}} a pathological state in which the normal physiological function of insulin is impaired in target tissues including skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and liver. Thiazolidinediones, synthetic ligands of the PPAR[gamma] nuclear receptor, are clinically potent insulin sensitizing drugs; however, not all individuals respond to treatment. Although PPAR[gamma] -mediated gene regulation is the predominant mode of thiazolidinedione-enhanced insulin sensitivity, the exact mechanisms by which PPARgamma activation leads to insulin sensitization or by which insulin sensitization is prevented are poorly understood. Addressing these expansive but fundamental questions concerning multi- tissue insulin resistance and PPAR[gamma] ligand-mediated insulin sensitization necessitates a comprehensive system- wide approach. The advent and maturation of the gene expression microarray allows for high-throughput transcript measurements. The massively parallel nature of microarrays, though, requires robust statistical analysis {{in order to obtain}} sensitive, accurate, and reliable results. With these tools, we characterize human subjects whom range in insulin sensitivity and relate their clinical phenotypes with functional pathway alterations. Multi-tissue gene expression profiles are further interrogated for distinctions between thiazolidinedione treatment responder and non-responder subjects. We further characterize the insulin sensitivity and multi-tissue gene expression profiles of lean and insulin resistant, obese Zucker rats treated with one of four PPAR[gamma] ligands, in order to identify functional pathways which are necessary for effective insulin sensitization. A robust statistical approach is formulated, through which sensitivity analysis of leading microarray statistical testers on various controlled datasets demonstrates that a global variance modeling methodology is advantageous towards increased sensitivity for the detection of true differential expression. With this devised approach, we identify pathway alterations in multiple tissues which are characteristic of insulin resistance, TZD-induced insulin <b>sensitization,</b> and <b>potential</b> TZD responsiveness. We also identify transcriptional biomarkers of insulin resistance and response signatures of PPAR[gamma] ligand treatment. These new insights suggest new targets for the therapy of type 2 diabetes, and measures to decrease risk for existing treatment...|$|R
40|$|Background: Temporary black henna tattoos {{are very}} popular as body adornment. Although contact allergy to natural henna is unusual, the {{inclusion}} of hair dye, p-phenylenediamine (PPD), {{increases the risk of}} contact sensitization. Objective: This study was performed to identify the presence and concentration of PPD in a black henna tattoo mixture to which our patient developed contact allergy. Methods: The presence of PPD in a black henna tattoo mixture, various samples of commercially available henna powders, and several hair dye products was qualitatively and quantitatively detected using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results: This study demonstrated that PPD was present in the black henna tattoo mixture at a concentration of 15. 7 %, which is significantly higher than commercial hair dye preparations. Conclusion: The presence of PPD in black henna tattoo mixtures in high concentration poses a health hazard and a risk of allergic contact <b>sensitization</b> with <b>potential</b> long-term consequences. Copyright 2002, Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved. THE ART OF BODY ADORNMENT by body piercingand tattooing has become increasingly popular in our modern culture. Temporary henna tattoos are readily available worldwide, last several weeks on the skin, and offer a self-limited, convenient alternative to a permanent tattoo. Since ancient times, henna has been used to paint the skin and dye hair. Although delayed 1 - 3 and immedi-ate 4, 5 hypersensitivity to henna has been reported, it is considered a rare allergen. The addition of p-phenylenediamine (PPD), which is widely recognized as a sensitizer, increases the risk of allergic contact dermatitis from these henna tattoo mix-tures and a number of cases have been reported. 6 - 11 We identified the presence of PPD both qualitatively and quan-titatively in a black henna tattoo mixture by high-perfor-mance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Case Report A 37 -year-old woman painted 2 black henna tattoos on her left upper arm and lower back. Within 24 to 48 hours, a pruritic dermatitis developed within the designs of both tattoos. Oral prednisone and topical clobetasol proprionate cream were given, and resolution occurred in 2 week...|$|R
40|$|Immediate {{early and}} constitutively {{expressed}} {{products of the}} Homer 1 gene regulate the functional assembly of post-synaptic density proteins at glutamatergic synapses to influence excitatory neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. Earlier studies of Homer 1 gene knock-out (KO) mice indicated active, but distinct, roles for IEG and constitutively expressed Homer 1 gene products in regulating cognitive, emotional, motivational and sensorimotor processing, as well as behavioral and neurochemical sensitivity to cocaine. More recent characterization of transgenic mice engineered to prevent generation of the IEG form (a. k. a Homer 1 a KO) pose a critical role for Homer 1 a in cocaine-induced behavioral and neurochemical sensitization of relevance to drug addiction and related neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we extend our characterization of the Homer 1 a KO mouse and report a modest pro-depressant phenotype, but no deleterious effects of the KO upon spatial learning/memory, prepulse inhibition, or cocaine-induced place-conditioning. As we reported previously, Homer 1 a KO mice did not develop cocaine-induced behavioral or neurochemical sensitization within the nucleus accumbens; however, virus-mediated Homer 1 a over-expression within the nucleus accumbens reversed the sensitization phenotype of KO mice. We also report several neurochemical abnormalities within the nucleus accumbens of Homer 1 a KO mice that include: elevated basal dopamine and reduced basal glutamate content, Group 1 mGluR agonist-induced glutamate release and high K+-stimulated release of dopamine and glutamate within this region. Many of the neurochemical anomalies exhibited by Homer 1 a KO mice are recapitulated upon deletion of the entire Homer 1 gene; however, Homer 1 deletion did not affect NAC dopamine or alter K+-stimulated neurotransmitter release within this region. These data show that the selective deletion of Homer 1 a produces a behavioral and neurochemical phenotype that is distinguishable from that produced by deletion of the entire Homer 1 gene. Moreover, the data indicate a specific role for Homer 1 a in regulating cocaine-induced behavioral and neurochemical <b>sensitization</b> of <b>potential</b> relevance to the psychotogenic properties of this drug...|$|R
