25|$|Silesia has {{undergone}} a similar notional extension at its eastern extreme. Historically, it extended {{only as far as}} the Brynica River, which separates it from Zagłębie Dąbrowskie in the Lesser Poland region. However, to many Poles today, Silesia (Śląsk) is understood to cover all of the area around Katowice, including Zagłębie. This interpretation is given official sanction {{in the use of the}} name Silesian Voivodeship (województwo <b>śląskie)</b> for the province covering this area. In fact, the word Śląsk in Polish (when used without qualification) now commonly refers exclusively to this area (also called Górny Śląsk or Upper Silesia).|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} time Silesian Voivodeship was {{appointed}} in Second Polish Republic. It had much wider range of power autonomy, than other contemporary Polish voivodeships and it covered all historical lands of Upper Silesia, which {{ended up in the}} Interwar period Poland (among them: Katowice (Kattowitz), Rybnik (Rybnik), Pszczyna (Pleß), Wodzisław (Loslau), Żory (Sohrau), Mikołów (Nikolai), Tychy (Tichau), Królewska Huta (Königshütte), Tarnowskie Góry (Tarnowitz), Miasteczko <b>Śląskie</b> (Georgenberg), Woźniki (Woischnik), Lubliniec (Lublinitz), Cieszyn (Teschen), Skoczów (Skotschau), Bielsko (Bielitz)). This Voivodeship did not include – as opposed to the present one – lands and cities of old pre-Partition Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Among the last ones the Southern part was included in Kraków Voivodeship Żywiec (Saybusch), Wilamowice (Wilmesau), Biała Krakowska (Biala) and Jaworzno), and the North Western part Będzin (Bendzin), Dąbrowa Górnicza (Dombrowa), Sosnowiec (Sosnowitz), Częstochowa (Tschenstochau), Myszków, Szczekociny (Schtschekotzin), Zawiercie, Sławków) belonged to Kielce Voivodeship.|$|E
25|$|In fall 1550, Isabella's troops defended Alba Iulia, but had {{to agree}} to a truce. She gained support from nobility in the diet of Aiud, but her forces were {{defeated}} near Cenad and she was besieged in Buda. In July 1551, facing superior forces, Isabella surrendered and signed the Treaty of Weissenburg. She agreed to give up Transylvania in exchange for Opole, Racibórz, and other territories so that her annual income would be 25,000 florins. For her domains in Hungary, which were valued at 140,000 florins, Isabella was to receive Ziębice, Ząbkowice <b>Śląskie,</b> and 100,000 florins in cash. John Sigismund was to marry one of Ferdinand's daughters. In August, Isabella gave up the Holy Crown of Hungary. According to Marcin Bielski, the cross atop of the crown was broken off and kept by John Sigismund who hoped one day to reunite the pieces. At the same time, John Sigismund was betrothed to 4-year-old Joanna of Austria.|$|E
500|$|Specht {{was born}} on 13 November 1914 in Frankenstein (modern Ząbkowice <b>Śląskie)</b> of Prussia (modern Poland). Specht was short in stature but full of energy. He had a {{distinguishing}} patch of gray in his hair just above his forehead. He was a perfectionist with a high sense of duty, and expected his men to follow his high standards. Although he lost his left eye in late 1939, according to Squadron Leader (...) Heinz Knoke of 5./JG 11, he could see like a vulture and was an excellent marksman. Specht also had an eye for detail, and he wrote detailed mission log reports for future use.|$|E
500|$|Przemysł II, {{faithful}} to his previous agreements with Henry IV Probus, decided {{to stand at}} the head of the knights of Poznań, Wrocław (which generally are loyal to his ruler) and Głogów (commanded by their Duke Henry III) and marched to Legnica in order to obtain the freedom of Henry IV. The Legnica army was commanded by Bolesław II and his eldest son Henry V the Fat. The battle took place on 24 April 1277 in the village of Stolec near Ząbkowice <b>Śląskie,</b> and, according to modern historiography, was extremely bloody and lasted almost the entire day. Initially it seemed that the coalition Poznań-Głogów-Wrocław would have a complete victory. The situation became even more favorable to them when Bolesław II escape from the battlefield. However, his son Henry V decided to stay until the end, and in this desperate situation encouraged his knights to fight, and finally obtain the victory; to complete the success, even Przemysł II and Henry III were taken prisoners. However, according to Jan Długosz in his chronicle, for the Dukes of Legnica this was a Pyrrhic victory, since [...] "died in this battle so countless number of people that the knights of Legnica, although the winner, they could mock the vanquished, because the bloody paid for victory". The imprisonment of the Duke of Poznań, if it occurred, was brief. The argument against this was noted in the fact that there is no record of Przemysł II having to pay for his release.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fourth stage}} {{was seen as}} the best chance for the sprinters to take a stage victory out of the entire Tour de Pologne.

2500|$|After a mild descent {{amongst the}} vast {{mountain}} pine shrub, it traverses {{the second highest}} peak of the range, Wielki Szyszak, the helmet shaped peak, which it derives its [...] Polish name from. Covered in granite rocks, it elevates distinctly over other [...] peaks {{of this part of}} the range, being the steepest and with the most alpine features.

Sniezne Kotly [...] offer landscapes over the whole Lower Silesia region. The trail traverses Łabski szczyt hosting the sources of the River Labe on the Czech side, then runs along the top of another post-glacial cirque, Wielki Kocioł Jagniątkowski, which precedes [...] two mild [...] peaks with the prominent rock formations, Czeskie Kamienie and <b>Śląskie</b> Kamienie (Silesian [...] Rocks and Czech Rocks).
