There functioned the production form besides factory such as putting-out system based on the peasant's <b>sideline</b> <b>work.</b> After the World War I, however, putting-out system in the weaving industry rapidly gave way to factory system that equipped the power looms. Contrastively, the industrial development in large cities, especially in Tokyo during the Inter-war period, entailed the increase of newly formed petty and small workshops. There functioned the production system based on the complex transaction of merchants, factories, small workshops and domestic works. Toy manufacturing, which developed as an export industry in the Inter-war Tokyo, was one of the typical industries based on that production system. As the urban area lacked the peasants and the intimate communities, urban small businesses stood on the different foundations. The skill was trained in the quasi-apprentice system where juvenile workers experienced a sort of on the job training. Based on this skill formation, not a few employees set up their own businesses and competed even with the wholesalers. Their activities were supported by the positive externality of the cluster. The formal and informal institutions played significant roles to prevent the transactions from disorder. The role of production organizer that combined the function of the merchant was also important. The combination of the merchant and the household economy, together with the social and institutional basis, promoted an industrialization based on the small businesses. ...|$|E

Among these actors, small workshops that had a certain level of skill for processing played a significant role to maintain this production system. The reproduction of these skills was preserved by the quasi-apprentice system within the workshops. Although the comparatively low wage in these workshops, the expectation to start up the own workshop after trained in the workshop attracted the juveniles. There existed the organizers (merchants) transferring market information to the manufacturing spot on one hand, and the reproduction of low cost workshops preparing a certain level of skills on the other hand. Being combined these two actors together and utilized the favorable urban environment such as integration of related industries and technologies, concentration of unskilled labour migrated from rural areas, the non-factory production system, which got into the phase of decline in the countryside, activated in urban areas after the World War I. ...|$|E

40|$|What is {{the nature}} of Barth's {{development}} over the 1920 s? Barth himself understood this period as his “apprenticeship,” and cites his 1931 book on Anselm as a significant juncture in moving beyond this stage in his thinking. Barth's emphasis upon both change and continuity {{lies at the heart of}} the discrepancy between two prominent interpreters of his theology, Hans Urs von Balthasar and Bruce McCormack. On the surface it appears as though their disagreement centers around Barth's employment of dialectic and analogy in his theology. However, our thesis is that this focus conceals the ontological strategies Barth's multifarious uses of analogy and dialectic always implied. Although McCormack is right to suggest that Balthasar's depiction of a shift from dialectic to analogy is inadequate, in the end McCormack's account of Barth's development over the 1920 s conceals as much as it reveals. The following essay attempts to demonstrate the kinds of insights which can be made of the past accounts of Barth's development which focused on the transition from dialectic to analogy. Far from relegating these accounts to the <b>sidelines,</b> McCormack's <b>work</b> helps us see all the more clearly just what was at stake in figures like Balthasar's work. By looking past McCormack and Balthasar's respective periodizations of Barth's development, a clearer focus upon Barth's theological ontology can begin to take place...|$|R
40|$|Integrated circuit {{technology}} continually presses toward higher transistor {{density and}} thus smaller dimensions, yet passive components which remain {{the bulk of}} the circuit area, surprisingly receive <b>sideline</b> attention. This <b>work</b> addresses a niche area of inductor design as it applies to the 3 -dimensional (3 -D) integration of active transistors and passive components. Hybrid, 3 -D circuits residing on inexpensive silicon substrates can be fashioned using a photosensitive epoxy known as SU- 8 serving as the interposer layer between the substrate and in which the passive components are embedded. The active components, which are known-good-chips, are secured with epoxy into deep reactive ion etched pockets in the silicon substrate. The inductors are fabricated in the SU- 8 covering the active chips. This technique saves considerable money and increases the yield of 3 -D circuits compared with the high cost of monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs). The design of solenoid inductors was simulated using a Matlab model incorporating closed-form equations. Herein, that model was developed and verified against both empirical data from fabricated solenoids and against data from a physical simulator in CoventorWare 2 ̆ 7 s 3 -D electromagnetic, software.

40|$|The {{experience}} of being in employment while pregnant or returning to work after having a child is not well researched in Ireland or indeed internationally. This report forms part of a major new research study on women’s experiences in the workplace during and after pregnancy commissioned by the HSE Crisis Pregnancy Programme and the Equality Authority. In addition to this report, the research involved a literature review examining a range of literature on pregnancy at work (Russell & Banks, 2011) and a nationwide survey of 2, 300 women who gave birth between July 2007 and June 2009 (Russell, Watson, Banks, forthcoming). The broad objective of the research {{was to investigate the}} influence of pregnancy and childbirth on women’s employment experiences, including an assessment of pregnancy-related discrimination in Ireland, and how these experiences are shaped by organisational factors and women’s attitudes and characteristics. Studies in Ireland and in other countries show that a significant proportion of women experience negative or unfair treatment in the workplace during pregnancy (Adams, 2005; La Valle et al, 2008; Russell and Banks, 2011; Russell, Watson, Banks, forthcoming). Such treatment can range from the extreme of dismissal on notification of pregnancy, unfair selection for redundancy or missing out on a promotion to more subtle forms of unequal treatment, such as changes in attitude from employers or co-workers.

40|$|The Criminal Justice System (CJS) has {{historically}} been a key site of social work intervention. Wacquant (2008, 2009 a and 2009 b) argues that the growth of social insecurity {{and the expansion of}} the penal state are endogenous features of the neo-liberal political project. The key premises of neo-liberalism have been accepted by parties of both the left and the right. Wacquant identifies that the “doxa” of the penal state such as “prison works” “zero tolerance” and “broken windows” have been widely accepted in an uncritical fashion. This shift alongside an increase in inequality had led to increasing social anxiety and mistrust. One manifestation of these trends is the “decline of the rehabilitative ideal” (Garland, 2001). Offenders, who were once generally viewed as marginalised individuals in need of social and welfare support are now regarded as sites of risk. The USA has led a penal arms race, in which, the use of imprisonment has grown significantly. In Europe, England and Wales has followed this trend most closely. Whilst acknowledging that penal policy {{is the result of a}} complex inter-relationship between social, cultural and historical factors, there are lessons to be learnt from the US experience. These include the impact of race and class inequalities as manifest in the CJS. The act of imprisonment is arguably an act of state violence and alongside the impact on individuals, communities and families, it has huge symbolic significance and value. The expansion of the penal state: the increasing numbers, poor conditions and the over-representation of minority groups mean that it should be a core social work concern. The paper outlines the ways, in which, risk and managerialism have <b>sidelined</b> core social <b>work</b> values in the CJS. It concludes that developments in the USA, particularly the decision in Brown v. Plata highlight a way out of the current impasse. Penal policy and conditions can only be reformed if the inherent dignity of offenders is rediscovered and placed at its centre...|$|R

Gilbert and her band played in clubs and ballrooms all over Hollywood, San Diego, and Southern California. They also {{took over the}} radio, as they were broadcast over KFWB, KFOX, and KFXM. They played on KFOX regularly, according to radio listings, and performed regularly at the Italian Village in Los Angeles during the cocktail hour primetime. These radio performances and club gigs led to Gilbert's continued popularity in the mid-1930s. [...] In March 1936, the band performed at the 41 Club’s 35th anniversary celebration, the Annual Dinner Dance of the California Yacht Club, and the Albert Sheetz Circus Café. The band at this point consisted of Kathleen McArtor on drums, Bunny Hart on guitar, Mable Hicks on trumpet, Caryl Agnew on piano, and Gilbert on saxophone. These performances were “rated tops as exponents of modern harmony and swing rhythm.” [...] In 1937, the band played at the Zenda Dance Café in Los Angeles five nights a week and appeared in the Second Hollywood Swing Concert at The Palomar. They were considered “one of the finest bands of its type in the country.” [...] In January 1938, Gilbert and her band returned to the Zenda Ballroom, where their two-week contract ended up extending to two years. The band continued to play in films during this time. They appeared in Melody for Two (1937), The Great Waltz (1938), Rhythm of the Saddle (1938) and Reckless Living (1938). In 1939, Gilbert and her band continued to be featured in many clubs and events, including the New Hollywood Café and the 15th Annual Policemen’s Ball in Phoenix, Arizona.

40|$|Slimness is {{associated}} with physical attractiveness, and fitness and health. Given that one in three New Zealand adults is overweight and one in four is obese, a desire to lose weight is common, especially for women. But weightloss, and particularly maintaining a reduced weight in the long term, is very difficult. Of people who lose {{a significant amount of}} weight, 95 percent are likely to regain the weight lost within five years with most relapses occurring soon after losing weight. My research explores the stories of nine women who have defied these odds and maintained a loss of over 25 percent of their body mass for over five years. In this thesis I have used a multiple-­‐methods approach to draw out my participants’ stories of successful slimming. My diverse methods involved engaging in a series of four one-­‐on-­‐one, unstructured, conversation-­‐type interviews with each participant. During these interviews, participants were asked to produce material objects such as photographs, pieces of clothing, diaries, and medical records to facilitate storytelling and discussion. Each participant also created a graph of her weight plotted over time, which was informed and elaborated by the objects she brought, and punctuated and further extended with annotations about life events. The timeline helped focus attention on how weight changed over time and the connections between weight change and meaningful life experiences and events. Creating the timeline also extended and enriched storytelling, and encouraged each participant to become a researcher of her own life. As an aid for drawing out stories and visualising lived experience, the process of creating the timeline (timelining) has become a useful new method for arts-­‐based graphic elicitation. Continuing with arts-­‐based methods, I have used an ethnodrama, Wishing at a Wedding, to present my research findings of the everydayness of successful slimming. My decision to explore Performative Social Science was premised on an awareness of the limitations of orthodox forms of research representation, and my respect for my participants’ motivation to take part in this research in order to help other women transform their lives. Performative Social Science forms such as ethnodrama are used to pique emotions, interrogate and disrupt long held prejudices and beliefs, and reach and edify wider audiences. In performative works the burden of interpretation is on the audience and there is potential for a broad and varied range of understandings. Because the voices of authors and theorisation can be thought to be <b>sidelined</b> in performative <b>works</b> I have also presented my research findings in a conventional academic form; a scholarly book chapter called, “Defying the odds—Successful slimming”. To further explore the broad and varied range of understandings elicited by performative works, opinions on the play are presented {{in the form of a}} magazine article, written by a member of the audience who attended the play, and an excerpt from a blog, written by a playwright. These different ways of explicating research findings invoke polyvocality. Polyvocality has been used to provide a variety of alternative positions or standpoints from which to view my research findings and enrich understandings of the world of weightloss and the day-­‐to-­‐day complexity of successful slimming. A metaphor of an expert tightrope walker performing (extra) ordinary feats of balancing is proposed to understand the ease with which successful slimmers maintain a reduced weight, and also the fear they face of slipping and falling from their narrow path of weightloss success. I argue that successful slimming requires obsessive moment-­‐by-­‐moment, day-­‐by-­‐day, year-­‐by-­‐year focused discipline and commitment. It is not a simple matter of eating a little less and moving a little more...|$|R

Since Si forms a covalent bond with itself., the pure crystal is homopolar, and does not absorb light. A charged defect will absorb in the normal way. However, in homopolar crystals such as Si, theoretical attempts to describe neutron scattering and other experiments have led to the rejection of the rigid-atom model in favour of the Shell model, which allows each atom a shell of outer electrons not rigidly attached to the nucleus. The effect of this is that the atoms are polarizable, and have an extra three decrees of freedom, associated with their electric dipole moments. In the case of a charged defect, there are now three absorption mechanisms: one due to the dipole of the oscillating charge itself; one due to the dipoles created throughout the crystal by the effect on the polarizable atoms of the changed polarizability of the defect; and a final mechanism whereby the charge on the defect sets up a static electric field which induces dipoles on the polarizable atoms through an anharmonic effect. The significance of this last mechanism relative to the others depends on whether or not the Lorentz local field correction is to be used. Using a version of the Shell model in which changes in the defect charge and polarizability can be included explicitly in the absorption, we show that this correction factor is always presents although it may be modified by changes in the defect polarizability. We are able to fit the experimental frequencies and intensities for the localized modes due to boron, and also for those due to carbon, using these changes as parameters. Our calculation is based on the simple relationships between the absorption, the susceptibility and the frequency-dependent displacement- displacement Green's functions. The parameters used in the Shell model for the perfect silicon lattice are taken from experimental fits to neutron data for the dispersion relations. In CaF 2, H - and D - ions have been substituted into F - sites. These ions differ from F - mainly in mass, and can be observed experimentally by absorption of infra-red light at 1. 849 x 10 14 ra/sec (H -) and 1. 323 x 10 14 ra/sec (D -). These figures indicate that the effect of the change of mass is reduced by a weakening of the force constants which bind the defect to the other ions in the lattice. We explain the changes in the above fundamental frequencies, and those of the harmonics, which appear when the crystal is subjected to uniaxial stress. The stress causes the lattice to strain, and the effect of this strain on the anharmonic forces present is to produce new terms in the harmonic forces, which modify the frequencies. In particular the weakened force constants at the defect allow additional relaxation of its neighbours, which makes the change in the frequency of the localized node more pronounced. We find the relaxation by a Green's function technique which inverts the force constant matrix, Φ, of the perfect lattice. The six force constants which constitute Φ out to 3 rd neighbours have been evaluated as parameters in a rigid-ion model which fits the elastic constants of CaF 2 and other experimental data. The changes in the central force constants coupling the defect with its 1 st and 2 nd neighbours are found by fitting the vibrational frequencies to the experimental data, and are respectively - 65 % and - 22 %. (It is also necessary to reduce the effective charge on the defect by 46 % to get this fit.) Using the relaxation obtained, assuming that the defect vibrates in a static environment, and taking as parameters the central anharmonic forces coupling the defect with its 1 st and 2 nd neighbours, we derive expressions for the parameters of the phenomenological model which describes the frequency changes of the defect vibrations under stress. We thus evaluate some of the anharmonic force constants, and can show that a Lennard-Jones potential describes the behaviour of the defect to a fair approximation. A useful <b>sideline</b> of this <b>work</b> is a derivation of the changes in the macroscopic elastic constants of a crystal which contains a small concentration of defects. </p...|$|R
