25|$|The city {{opened its}} Public Electronic Network (PEN) in 1989, {{providing}} citizens with {{a bulletin board}} system (BBS) to discuss local issues and access city <b>services.</b> <b>PEN</b> was the first municipally operated BBS in the world. While plagued by the ills common to BBSes, the site empowered residents. Due {{in part to the}} placement of publicly available terminals in libraries, homeless persons and their issues received considerable attention on PEN. The SWASHLOCK (Showers, WASHers, and LOCKers) plan was developed on PEN and implemented in 1993. PEN also served as a center to organize opposition to the 1990 proposal to redevelop 415 PCH.|$|R

40|$|Significant {{problems}} for the transfer of information in the complex medical environment include the requirements for machine reading {{of a variety of}} documents, linking the patient and services with certainty and in the clinical laboratory linking the sample identity with instrumental data output. A system has been developed to solve these problems. Alpha numeric including bar coded patient identity is prepared readily at patient admission in negative form for patient wrist bracelet and nursing station use. All information on the negatives can be transferred by flash illumination to an ultraviolet light sensitive gummed label which may be affixed to documents, drugs, patient sample or <b>service.</b> Light <b>pen</b> scanning of the bar code identity provides a facile entry of bar coded patient, document, service, sample or result information into a computer. In the clinical laboratory automated laser reading of the sample accession number has been coupled with on line analytical instrument output. Overall this system eliminates most manual data transcription from patient arrival to report generation. It is especially applicable to minicomputers and distributed networks...|$|R
50|$|Though {{the company}} enjoyed {{high levels of}} public {{awareness}} and generally positive attention from industry press, it ran into fierce competition, first from Microsoft (whose <b>Pen</b> <b>Services</b> for Windows were later {{the subject of an}} FTC investigation and patent violation suits by GO), and later from Apple's Newton project, and others. The company lined up software development partners but struggled to deliver hardware and software on their intended schedule. In 1991, they spun off their hardware unit under the name EO Inc., and in 1993 EO was acquired by AT&T Corporation, who hoped that its devices would showcase their AT&T Hobbit microprocessors. This sale raised much-needed cash but introduced new problems, as EO then ceased to coordinate well with GO's management, even considering adopting competing operating systems. Facing a cash crisis, GO agreed to sell itself to AT&T as well, bringing the two halves of the company back under one roof as of January 1994.|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of policy {{concerns}} regarding social exclusion, a range of agencies has collected information on, and delivered services for, "vulnerable" young people. Technological developments enhance possibilities of linking information from different sources to "map" and "track" young people as they move between agencies and their activity status changes. This report outlines some of the advantages and limitations of "mapping" and "tracking" methodologies. It identifies examples of good practice and difficulties which agencies have encountered in building reliable, accurate, up-to-date and robust systems.

"Keeping track": traces the changing nature of youth transitions; explores the concepts of "mapping" and "tracking"; outlines the results of a survey of activities of careers <b>service</b> companies; presents <b>pen</b> portraits of a number of local tracking projects and discusses key issues emerging. This report is important reading for policy makers, practitioners and researchers concerned with social exclusion and the delivery of services to young people. It is of particular relevance to those working in careers services, local authorities, the voluntary sector and others engaging in partnership at local level...|$|R
6000|$|It {{is worth}} while {{to learn from}} Burns himself {{what he thought of}} his talent for prose-composition. And in the first place it is to be noted that he practised prose-composition before he took to poetry. At sixteen he was {{carrying}} on an extensive literary correspondence, which was virtually a competition in essay-writing. He kept copies of the letters he liked best, and was flattered to find that he was superior to his correspondents. He studied the essayists of Queen Anne's time, and formed his style upon theirs, and that of their most distinguished followers. Steele, Addison, Swift, Sterne, and Mackenzie were his models. He liked their rounded sentences, and caught their conventional phrases. He found delight in imitating them. He volunteered his <b>services</b> with the <b>pen</b> on behalf of his fellow-swains. He became the [...] "Complete Letter-Writer" [...] of his parish, and was proud of his function and his faculty. He was aware of his [...] "abilities at a billet-doux." [...] To the very last he had a high opinion of himself as a writer of letters. He speaks of one letter being in his [...] "very best manner;" [...] and of waiting for an hour of inspiration to write another that should be as good. He retained copies of about thirty of his longer letters, and had them bound for preservation.|$|R
50|$|On 27 May that year, {{the steamer}} service Croix du Sud was shipwrecked off the Apataki atoll {{and for a}} period of three months the island was left without mail or supplies. When mail <b>service</b> resumed, Gauguin <b>penned</b> an angry attack on Governor Petit in an open letter, {{complaining}} amongst other things about the way they had been abandoned following the shipwreck. The letter was published by L'Indepéndant, the successor newspaper to Les Guêpes, that November in Papeete. Petit had in fact followed an independent and pro-native policy, to the disappointment of the Roman Catholic Party, and the newspaper was preparing an attack on him. Gauguin also sent the letter to Mercure de France, which published a redacted version of it after his death. He followed this with a private letter {{to the head of the}} gendarmerie in Papeete, complaining about his own local gendarme Charpillet's excesses in making prisoners labour for him. Danielsson notes that, while these and similar complaints were well-founded, the motivation for them all was wounded vanity and simple animosity. As it happened, the relatively supportive Charpillet was replaced that December by another gendarme Jean-Paul Claverie from Tahiti, much less well disposed to Gauguin and who in fact had fined him in his earliest Mataiea days for public indecency, having caught him bathing naked in a local stream following complaints from the missionaries there.|$|R
5000|$|This {{activity}} gained him recognition {{abroad and}} gifts {{of money from}} the British and Austrian governments; but it made his position as an official in Berlin impossible, for the Prussian government had no mind to abandon its attitude of cautious neutrality. Private affairs also combined to urge Gentz to leave the Prussian service; for, mainly through his own fault, a separation with his wife was arranged. In May 1802, accordingly, he took leave {{of his wife and}} left with his friend Adam Müller for Vienna. In Berlin he had been intimate with the Austrian ambassador, Count Stadion, whose good offices procured him an introduction to the emperor Francis. The immediate result was the title of imperial councillor, with a yearly salary of 4000 gulden (6 December 1802); {{but it was not until}} 1809 that he was actively employed. Before returning to Berlin to make arrangements for transferring himself finally to Vienna, Gentz paid a visit to London, where he made the acquaintance of Pitt and Grenville, who were so impressed with his talents that, in addition to large money presents, he was guaranteed an annual pension by the British government in recognition of the value of the <b>services</b> of his <b>pen</b> against Bonaparte. From this time forward he was engaged in a ceaseless polemic against every fresh advance of the Napoleonic power and pretensions; with matchless sarcasm he lashed the nerveless policy of courts which suffer indignity with resignation; he denounced the recognition of Napoleon's imperial title, and drew up a manifesto of Louis XVIII against it. The formation of the coalition and the outbreak of war for a while raised his hopes, in spite of his lively distrust of the competence of Austrian ministers; but the hopes were speedily dashed by the Battle of Austerlitz and its results. Gentz used his enforced leisure to write a brilliant essay on The relations between England and Spain before the outbreak of war between the two powers (Leipzig, 1806); and shortly afterwards appeared Fragmente aus der neuesten Geschichte des politischen Gleichgewichts in Europa (translated as Fragments on the Balance of Power in Europe, London, 1806). This latter, the last of Gentz's works as an independent publicist, was a masterly exposé of the actual political situation, and at the same time prophetic in its suggestions as to how this should be retrieved: [...] "Through Germany Europe has perished; through Germany it must rise again". He realized that the dominance of France could only be broken by the union of Austria and Prussia, acting in concert with Great Britain. He watched with interest the Prussian military preparations, and, at the invitation of Count Haugwitz, he went at the outset of the campaign to the Prussian headquarters at Erfurt, where he drafted the king's proclamation and his letter to Napoleon. The writer was known, and it was in this connection that Napoleon referred to him as a [...] "wretched scribe named Gentz, one of those men without honor who sell themselves for money". In this mission Gentz had no official mandate from the Austrian government, and whatever hopes he may have cherished of privately influencing the situation in the direction of an alliance between the two German powers were speedily dashed by the campaign of Jena.|$|R
60|$|I have animadverted, heretofore, {{upon the}} unprofessional eagerness of our Generals {{to appear in}} the {{character}} of negotiators when the sword would have done them more <b>service</b> than the <b>pen.</b> But, if they had confined themselves to mere military regulations, they might indeed with justice have been grievously censured as injudicious commanders, whose notion of the honour of armies was of a low pitch, and who had no conception of the peculiar nature of the service in which they were engaged: but the censure must have stopped here. Whereas, by these provisions, they have shewn that they have never reflected upon the nature of military authority as contra-distinguished from civil. French example had so far dazzled and blinded them, that the French army is suffered to denominate itself 'the French government;' and, from the whole tenour of these instruments, (from the preamble, and these articles especially,) it should seem that our Generals fancied themselves and their army to be the British government. For these regulations, emanating from a mere military authority, are purely civil; but of such a kind, that no power on earth could confer a right to establish them. And this trampling upon the most sacred rights--this sacrifice of the consciousness of a self-preserving principle, without which neither societies nor governments can exist, is not made by our generals in relation to subjects of their own sovereign, but to an independent nation, our ally, into whose territories we could not have entered but from its confidence in our friendship and good faith. Surely the persons, who (under the countenance of too high authority) have talked so loudly of prejudging this question, entirely overlooked or utterly forgot this part of it. What have these monstrous provisions to do with the relative strength of the two armies, or with any point admitting a doubt? What need here of a Court of Judicature to settle who were the persons (their names are subscribed by their own hands), and to determine the quality of the thing? Actions and agents like these, exhibited in this connection with each other, must of necessity be condemned the moment they are known: and to assert the contrary, is to maintain that man is a being without understanding, and that morality is an empty dream. And, if this condemnation must after this manner follow, to utter it is less a duty than a further inevitable consequence from the constitution of human nature. They, who hold that the formal sanction of a Court of Judicature is in this case required before a people has a right to pass sentence know not to what degree they are enemies to that people and to mankind; to what degree selfishness, whether arising from their peculiar situation or from other causes, has in them prevailed over those faculties which are our common inheritance, and cut them off from fellowship with the species. Most deplorable would be the result, if it were possible that the injunctions of these men could be obeyed, or their remonstrances acknowledged to be just. For, (not to mention that, {{if it were not for}} such prompt decisions of the public voice, misdemeanours of men high in office would rarely be accounted for at all,) we must bear in mind, at this crisis, that the adversary of all good is hourly and daily extending his ravages; and, according to such notions of fitness, our indignation, our sorrow, our shame, our sense of right and wrong, and all those moral affections, and powers of the understanding, by which alone he can be effectually opposed, are to enter upon a long vacation; their motion is to be suspended--a thing impossible; if it could, it would be destroyed.|$|R
