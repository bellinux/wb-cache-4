50|$|The <b>{{southern}}</b> <b>marbled</b> newt occurs only {{in southern}} Portugal and southwestern Spain, in Mediterranean climate. The Douro-Tagus watershed forms a narrow, northern border {{to the range}} of Triturus marmoratus.|$|R
50|$|Species seen: shore crab, pipefish, dormice, badgers, little egrets, {{butterflies}} (gatekeeper, red admirals, <b>marbled</b> white, <b>skipper),</b> moths (rosy footman, swallowtailed, scarce silver-lines) and seals.|$|R
50|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>marbled</b> newt or pygmy {{marbled newt}} (Triturus pygmaeus) is {{a species of}} {{salamander}} in the Salamandridae family. It is found in Portugal and Spain. Its natural habitats are temperate forests, Mediterranean-type shrubby vegetation, rivers, intermittent rivers, freshwater marshes, intermittent freshwater marshes, arable land, pastureland, rural gardens, water storage areas, ponds, open excavations, irrigated land, canals and ditches. It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|R
5|$|As of 2016, {{the genus}} {{contains}} nine accepted species. There are seven species of crested newts: Anatolian crested newt (Triturus anatolicus), Balkan crested newt (T. ivanbureschi), Danube crested newt (T. dobrogicus), Italian crested newt (T. carnifex), Macedonian crested newt (T. macedonicus), northern crested newt (T. cristatus), and southern crested newt (T. karelinii). Marbled newts have two species, the marbled newt (T. marmoratus) and the <b>southern</b> <b>marbled</b> newt (T. pygmaeus).|$|R
5000|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>marbled</b> newt {{lives in}} oak {{woodland}} and uses ponds, ditches and other water bodies for breeding. Its habitat is being degraded by urbanization {{and the loss}} of temporary water bodies. Another threat to the species is the introduction of crayfish and non-native fish and the pollution of its breeding sites. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its status as being [...] "near threatened".|$|R
5|$|The {{northern}} {{crested newt}} {{is the most}} widespread species, while the others are confined to smaller regions, e.g. the southwestern Iberian Peninsula in the <b>southern</b> <b>marbled</b> newt, and the Danube basin {{and some of its}} tributaries in the Danube crested newt. The Italian crested newt (T. carnifex) has been introduced outside its native range in some European countries and the Azores. In the northern Balkans, four species of crested newt occur in close vicinity, and may sometimes even co-exist.|$|R
500|$|Most of the crested and marbled newts {{are listed}} as species of [...] "least concern" [...] by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, but {{population}} declines have been registered in all assessed species. The Danube crested newt and the <b>southern</b> <b>marbled</b> newt are considered [...] "near threatened" [...] because populations have declined significantly. Populations have been affected more heavily in some countries and species are listed in some national red lists. The Anatolian, Balkan and the Macedonian crested newt, recognised only recently, {{have not yet been}} evaluated separately for conservation status.|$|R
40|$|Ponds are {{important}} resources of freshwater; they provide ecologic stepping-stones {{and have a}} significant importance as habitats for a multiplicity of plants and animals. But today the European ponds are declining dramatically going along with the disappearing of many species that depend on them. Fundación Monte Mediterráneo, a foundation for nature conservation and ecologic agriculture, launches a project to rescue the ponds. On the Dehesa San Francisco, an area in Huelva/Andalusia (Spain), still existing ponds will be conserved and optimized and new ponds will be created for the rescue of the aquatic species like the <b>southern</b> <b>marbled</b> newt Triturus pygmaeus (Wolterstorff 1905) an the spanish pond turtle Mauremys leprosa (Schweigger 1812) ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>southern</b> <b>marbled</b> newt {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to the marbled newt but is smaller, with adults reaching a total length of 13 cm as against the latter's 17 cm. The dorsal surface is yellowish-green heavily mottled with irregular patches of dark brown or black, {{and there is a}} thin orange line running along the spine from head to tip of tail, although this stripe fades somewhat in adult males. The underparts are creamy-white with dark spots which distinguishes this species from the marbled newt with its dark underparts. Breeding males have a wavy, black-barred crest running from the head tail tip, but this has no indentation between body and tail.|$|R
25|$|The Limestone grasslands {{support a}} wide variety of wild flowers, and many rarer {{butterflies}} can be seen. Pearl-bordered fritillary, Duke of Burgundy fritillary, <b>marbled</b> white, dingy <b>skipper</b> and grayling are just some of species that inhabit the national park.|$|R
50|$|The chalk {{grassland}} habitat is particularly attractive to {{many species of}} butterflies such as the Adonis blue, the chalkhill blue, <b>marbled</b> white, silver-spotted <b>skipper,</b> the dark green fritillary, and the silver-washed fritillary. Over 30 species of butterflies have been recorded on the reserve.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{a variety}} of birds in the lake shores: ducks, like the red-crested pochard, common pochard, mallard and tufted duck, as well as the Eurasian coot, common moorhen, great reed warbler, bearded reedling, purple heron, little bittern and egrets.In the waters of the lakes there are also endemic Iberian fishes like the Rutilus lemmingii, Luciobarbus guiraonis, Iberian barbel, Luciobarbus microcephalus, Squalius pyrenaicus, as well as {{introduced}} species, like the common carp, northern pike, largemouth bass and Gambusia holbrooki. [...] The Procambarus clarkii is an introduced species of crayfish that has caused great damage to the local aquatic fauna.Among the amphibians, the European tree frog, Mediterranean tree frog and the <b>southern</b> <b>marbled</b> newt are present along the shores of the lakes.|$|R
5|$|At {{the onset}} of the Quaternary glacial cycles, around 2.6 mya, the extant Triturus species had already emerged. They were thus {{affected}} by the cycles of expansion and retreat of cold, inhospitable regions, which shaped their distribution. A study using environmental niche modelling and phylogeography showed that during the Last Glacial Maximum, around 21,000 years ago, crested and marbled newts likely survived in warmer refugia mainly in southern Europe. From there, they recolonised the northern parts after glacial retreat. The study also showed that species range boundaries shifted, with some species replacing others during recolonisation, for example the <b>southern</b> <b>marbled</b> newt which expanded northwards and replaced the marbled newt. Today's most widespread species, the northern crested newt, was likely confined to a small refugial region in the Carpathian Basin during the last glaciation, and from there expanded its range north-, east- and westwards when the climate rewarmed.|$|R
50|$|The thin chalk soils to {{the east}} of the site support a typical downland plant {{community}} with pyramidal orchids being a particular feature in the summer. In recent years a programme of scrub clearance has been undertaken. The area is good for butterflies including common blue, chalkhill blue, small, large and dingy <b>skippers,</b> <b>marbled</b> white, gatekeeper, and meadow brown.|$|R
5|$|During their {{terrestrial}} phase, crested and marbled newts {{depend on}} a landscape that offers cover, invertebrate prey and humidity. The precise requirements of most species are still poorly known, as the newts are {{much more difficult to}} detect and observe on land. Deciduous woodlands or groves are in general preferred, but conifer woods are also accepted, especially in the far northern and southern ranges. The <b>southern</b> <b>marbled</b> newt is typically found in Mediterranean oak forests. In the absence of forests, other cover-rich habitats, as for example hedgerows, scrub, swampy meadows, or quarries, can be inhabited. Within such habitats, the newts use hiding places such as logs, bark, planks, stone walls, or small mammal burrows; several individuals may occupy such refuges at the same time. Since the newts in general stay very close to their aquatic breeding sites, the quality of the surrounding terrestrial habitat largely determines whether an otherwise suitable water body will be colonised.|$|R
5|$|Other Triturus species only meet at narrow zones {{on their}} range borders. Hybridisation does occur {{in several of}} these contact zones, as shown by genetic data and {{intermediate}} forms, but is rare, supporting overall reproductive isolation. Backcrossing and introgression do however occur as shown by mitochondrial DNA analysis. In {{a case study in}} the Netherlands, genes of the introduced Italian crested newt were found to introgress into the gene pool of the native northern crested newt. The two marbled newt species can be found in proximity in a narrow area in central Portugal and Spain, but they usually breed in separate ponds, and individuals in that area could be clearly identified as one of the two species. Nevertheless, there is introgression, occurring in both directions at some parts of the contact zone, and only {{in the direction of the}} <b>southern</b> <b>marbled</b> newt where that species had historically replaced the marbled newt (see also above, Glacial refugia and recolonisation).|$|R

500|$|Courtship display {{serves to}} emphasise the male's body and crest size and to waft pheromones towards the female. A {{position}} characteristic {{for the large}} Triturus species is the [...] "cat buckle", where the male's body is kinked and often rests only on the forelegs ("hand stand"). He will also lean towards the female ("lean-in"), rock his body, and flap his tail towards her, sometimes lashing it violently ("whiplash"). If the female shows interest, the ritual enters the third phase, where the male creeps away from her, his tail quivering. When the female touches his tail with her snout, he deposits a packet of sperm (a spermatophore) on the ground. The ritual ends with the male guiding the female over the spermatophore, which she then takes up with her cloaca. In the <b>southern</b> <b>marbled</b> newt, courtship is somewhat different from the larger species in {{that it does not}} seem to involve male [...] "cat buckles" [...] and [...] "whiplashes", but instead slower tail fanning and undulating of the tail tip (presumably to mimic a prey animal and lure the female).|$|R
500|$|Adult newts begin {{moving to}} their {{breeding}} sites in spring when temperatures stay above [...] This usually occurs in March for most species, {{but can be}} much earlier in the southern parts of the distribution range. <b>Southern</b> <b>marbled</b> newts mainly breed from January to early March and may already enter ponds in autumn. The time adults spend in water differs among species and correlates with body shape: while it is only about three months in the marbled newts, it is six months in the Danube crested newt, whose slender body is best adapted to swimming. Triturus newts in their aquatic phase are mostly nocturnal and, compared to the smaller newts of Lissotriton and Ichthyosaura, usually prefer the deeper parts of a water body, where they hide under vegetation. As with other newts, they occasionally {{have to move to}} the surface to breathe air. The aquatic phase serves not only for reproduction, but also offers the animals more abundant prey, and immature crested newts frequently return to the water in spring even if they do not breed.|$|R

5|$|There {{are several}} local nature {{reserves}} {{in and around}} Taunton, which are protected under a statutory designation in Section 21 of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. South Taunton Streams is an urban wetland, and in the northern suburbs is the Children's Wood riverside reserve which provides a movement corridor for animals including otters {{along the banks of}} the River Tone. Birds occurring at the site include: kingfisher, dipper, grey wagtail, mute swan, grey heron and reed warbler. It is also home to butterflies such as the small and large <b>skipper,</b> <b>marbled</b> white, small heath and small copper, and to dragonflies and damselflies.|$|R
50|$|The hill is the Site of Special Scientific Interest and a National Nature Reserve {{managed by}} Natural England. This {{unimproved}} chalk downland {{is home to}} a number of butterfly species, including the Adonis blue, chalkhill blue, common blue, dark green fritillary, Essex <b>skipper,</b> <b>marbled</b> white, meadow brown, silver-spotted skipper, small heath, small skipper, and the speckled wood. There is also a diverse bird population, including the European green woodpecker, commonly seen feeding amongst the many anthills (which are also very important for the lifecycle of the Lycaenidae butterflies) and the turtle dove. Many species of orchid {{can be found on the}} hill or in the immediate vicinity including the fly, bee and frog orchids.|$|R
50|$|Mammals:The {{following}} {{descriptions of}} mammals of the Ammiq wetlands {{have all been}} recorded by A Rocha personnel in the Aammiq region from 1997 onwards. The region covered includes not just the valley floor wetlands but also the adjacent farmlands and the slopes of Mount Barouk. In addition to these, other mammal species are probably present but {{have not yet been}} positively identified. One mammal of interest is the European otter Lutra lutra which was reported in the Aammiq wetlands prior to 1975; its reappearance was confirmed in June 2003. Water buffalos were introduced to the swamp {{in order to maintain the}} health of the vegetation cover and the swamp itself, since buffalo graze wetlands in a more efficient way than other herbivores. The mammals recorded in the region include: southern white-breasted hedgehog (Erinaceus concolor), Cape hare (Lepus capensis), Caucasian squirrel (Sciurus anomalus), Indian porcupine (Hystrix indica), gray wolf (Canis lupus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), European otter (Lutra lutra), European badger (Meles meles), striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena), mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella), wild boar (Sus scrofa). The area was probably also the home of some extinct mammals from Lebanon such as the Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica), and the Asiatic cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus).Birds:Nearly 260 bird species have been recorded in the Aammiq region either by A Rocha personnel or people working with A Rocha from 1996 onwards. The Aammiq region includes not just the valley floor wetlands but also the adjacent farmlands and the sometimes wooded rocky slopes of Mount Barouk.The listing of these birds does not give any idea of their abundance or status. While some of the birds recorded below are residents, others are passage migrants. Some of these, such as the white stork and the lesser spotted eagle, may pass over Aammiq in flocks of hundreds at a time. Other migrants fly over in far smaller numbers. Species include: pygmy cormorant (Phalacrocorax pygmeus), white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus), greater flamingo (Phoenicopterus rubber), ferruginous duck (Aythya nyroca), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), Verreaux's eagle (Aquila verreauxii), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), common crane (Grus grus), rock pigeon (Columba livia).Amphibians and reptiles: The amphibians and reptiles listed below have been recorded in the Aammiq region either by A Rocha personnel or people working with A Rocha from 1996 onwards. As with the other species lists, the Aammiq region is here taken to include not just the valley floor wetlands, which are very rich in reptiles, but also the adjacent farmlands and the rocky slopes of Mount Barouk. Herpetology, the study of reptiles and amphibians, is a specialised field and as yet there has been no systematic A Rocha herpetological survey of this area. Far more species are known to exist in the area than the ones reported. Species include: European green toad (Bufo viridis), Levantine frog (Rana bedriagae), Levant green lizard (Lacerta media), European worm snake (Typhlops vermicularis), Levant viper (Macrovipera lebetina).Moths, butterflies, and dragonflies:As with many other groups, the moths of the Aammiq region are poorly known. The list below represents an incomplete and provisional list of species so far recorded, though the Aammiq region is rich in butterflies. A Rocha personnel recorded several new records of species since 1998 such as: Oriental <b>marbled</b> <b>skipper</b> (Carcharodus boeticus), swallowtail (Papilio machaon), scarce swallowtail (Iphiclides podalirius), false Apollo (Archon apollinus), large white (Pieris brassicae), plain tiger (Danaus chrysippus), long-tailed blue (Lampides boeticus). Also the Aammiq region has a surprising diversity of dragonflies which can be divided into two groups, the Zygoptera (damselflies) and the Anisoptera (the insects commonly referred to as dragonflies), species include: azure damselfly (Coenagrion puella), blue-tailed damselfly (Ischnura elegans), emperor dragonfly (Anax imperator), southern darter (Sympetrum meridionale), scarlet dragonfly (Crocothemis erythraea).|$|R
