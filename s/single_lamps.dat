50|$|To {{produce a}} {{complete}} television, the shutter assembly {{is combined with}} control electronics and backlight. The backlight for small sets can be provided by a <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> using a diffuser or frosted mirror to spread out the light, but for larger displays a <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> is not bright enough and the rear surface is instead covered {{with a number of}} separate lamps. Achieving even lighting over the front of an entire display remains a challenge, and bright and dark spots are not uncommon.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{wireless}} {{monitoring system}} {{was carried out}} to manage the streetlight in Tianjin bonded area. The system adapted a concentric dropping voltage energy-saving mode and the <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> was monitored without control. The <b>single</b> <b>lamp’s</b> electrical information was trapped by a detecting module {{and sent to the}} communication terminal by power carrier technology. Then the collected information of termination was transferred to a remote monitoring center by GPRS communication module. The streetlights in the subsection were on-off by combining timing with illuminance. The practice shows this system is reliable and effective...|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{developed}} for predicting the radiant heat flux distribution produced by tungsten filament, tubular fused-quartz envelope heating systems with reflectors. The method is {{an application of}} Monte Carlo simulation, which {{takes the form of}} a random walk or ray tracing scheme. The method is applied to four systems of increasing complexity, including a <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> without a reflector, a <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> with a Hat reflector, a <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> with a parabolic reflector, and up to six lamps in a six-lamp contoured-reflector heating unit. The application of the Monte Carlo method to the simulation of the thermal radiation generated by these systems is discussed. The procedures for numerical implementation are also presented. Experiments were conducted to study these quartz heating systems and to acquire measurements of the corresponding empirical heat flux distributions for correlation with analysis. The experiments were conducted such that several complicating factors could be isolated and studied sequentially. Comparisons of the experimental results with analysis are presented and discussed. Good agreement between the experimental and simulated results was obtained in all cases. This study shows that this method can be used to analyze very complicated quartz heating systems and can account for factors such as spectral properties, specular reflection from curved surfaces, source enhancement due to reflectors and/or adjacent sources, and interaction with a participating medium in a straightforward manner...|$|R
50|$|The halt {{was opened}} in 1908. It {{was a very}} basic affair, being without a platform, and {{consisting}} just of a fenced enclosure and a signboard, though did {{have the benefit of}} a <b>single</b> <b>lamp.</b> When the line was built through the location, an ancient motte was damaged by the building work.|$|R
50|$|Combination HPS/MH lights {{combine a}} metal halide and a {{high-pressure}} sodium {{in the same}} bulb, providing both red and blue spectrums in a <b>single</b> HID <b>lamp.</b> The combination of blue metal halide light and red high-pressure sodium light {{is an attempt to}} provide a very wide spectrum within a <b>single</b> <b>lamp.</b> This allows for a single bulb solution throughout the entire life cycle of the plant, from vegetative growth through flowering. There are potential tradeoffs for the convenience of a single bulb in terms of yield. There are however some qualitative benefits that come for the wider light spectrum.|$|R
60|$|Silently, {{he strode}} into the apartment, a small {{antechamber}} off a large hall. At one end was an open hearth upon which logs were burning brightly, while a <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> aided in diffusing a soft glow about the austere chamber. In {{the center of the}} room was a table, and at the sides several benches.|$|R
50|$|Each lamp must be {{returned}} to one of several lamp racks in the kingdom. As the player can only carry a <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> at a time, this can mean a lot of traveling back and forth. Once all the lamps have been returned to the rack, the level is complete, and the player advances to the next level.|$|R

25|$|Proponents of twin rear {{fog lamps}} say two lamps provide vehicle {{distance}} information not available from a <b>single</b> <b>lamp.</b> Proponents of the <b>single</b> rear fog <b>lamp</b> say dual {{rear fog lamps}} closely mimic the appearance of illuminated stop lamps (which are mandatorily installed in pairs), reducing the conspicuity of the stop lamps' message when the rear fogs are activated. To provide some safeguard against rear fog lamps being confused with stop lamps, UN Regulation 48 requires a separation of at least 10cm between the closest illuminated edges of any stop lamp and any rear fog lamp.|$|R
50|$|The light {{originally}} used eleven wicks and reflectors, but in 1855 {{a fourth}} order Fresnel lens with a <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> was substituted, with the lantern upgraded in 1867 {{to fit the}} new lens better. The lighting arrangements were upgraded several times over the years, with electrification coming in 1942. Its automation in 1947 brought about the retirement of Fannie Salter, the last woman lighthouse keeper in the United States.|$|R

60|$|We all {{had good}} reason to join in the aspiration; for our vigil was a long and bitter one. Slowly the shadows darkened over the long, sombre face of the old house. A cold, damp reek from the moat chilled us to the bones and set our teeth chattering. There was a <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> over the gateway and a steady globe of light in the fatal study. Everything else was dark and still.|$|R
50|$|The {{causeway}} {{is supported}} by three arches on the eastern side, while thirty-eight arches support it on the western side. It was built {{at a cost of}} £3,333. A local tradition states that the bridge was built by the Jesuits in a single night using the light of a <b>single</b> <b>lamp.</b> On 22 June 1634, the bridge, as well as the surrounding land was handed over to the municipal chamber of the city for its maintenance and upkeep.|$|R
50|$|Pumping with a <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> {{tends to}} focus {{most of the}} energy on one side, {{worsening}} the beam profile. It is common for rods to have a frosted barrel, to diffuse the light, providing a more even distribution of light throughout the rod. This allows more energy absorption throughout the gain medium for a better transverse mode. A frosted flow tube or diffuse reflector, while leading to lowered transfer efficiency, helps increase this effect, improving the gain.|$|R
60|$|The Jew {{was evidently}} too {{familiar}} with the ground he traversed to be at all bewildered, either by {{the darkness of the}} night, or the intricacies of the way. He hurried through several alleys and streets, and at length turned into one, lighted only by a <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> at the farther end. At the door of a house in this street, he knocked; having exchanged a few muttered words with the person who opened it, he walked upstairs.|$|R
30|$|The {{loading and}} {{unloading}} detection system mainly detects the position change of the seedling plate from the seedling storage mechanism to the seedling plate conveyor belt and obtains the position signal as the action control signal of {{loading and unloading}}. The system includes PVDF pressure sensor, travel switch, limit sensor, and a <b>single</b> <b>lamp.</b> The PVDF pressure sensor is arranged {{in the middle of}} the slot wheel-type seedling storage tray and is in the same vertical plane with the push rod mechanism, which is used to detect whether the seedling storage tray is empty or not. It also lights the <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> and instructs the start of the sprocket drive motor. The stroke switch mainly detects the displacement of the sprocket drive of the seedling storage tray and determines whether the seedling storage tray reaches the feeding position. Its signal is used to instruct the push rod mechanism to push the seedling tray to the conveyor belt. The limit sensor is installed at the starting position of the conveyor belt, and its signal is used to control the reset action of the pushing mechanism.|$|R
25|$|Where {{junction}} {{indicators are}} unsuitable, route indicators {{are also used}} in colour-light areas. They may {{take the form of}} a dot-matrix of white lamps, or, in more recent installations, fibre-optic displays driven from a <b>single</b> <b>lamp</b> to display the route code. At certain locations, no route indication is given for the highest-speed route. As with semaphore route indicators, they are usually restricted to areas where all routes are at low speed, often on the approach or departure from large stations.|$|R
