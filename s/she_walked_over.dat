25|$|A {{native of}} Louisville, Kentucky, Yocum {{met his wife}} Mareike in Germany. He {{proposed}} marriage {{to her on the}} 100th mile of the hike, and they were married at mile 256. <b>She</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> 4,000 miles with him {{during the course of the}} walk.|$|E
60|$|She {{caught the}} first train after breakfast, and {{in fifteen minutes}} she was at Beverly Farms. <b>She</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> to her father's cottage, where she found him smoking his cigar on the veranda.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{is looking}} better to-day; she has looked very worn and harassed, but I thought her {{brighter}} to-day. <b>She</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> by Aubrey on his pony, and I {{think it did}} her good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] said Ermine; [...] "every one {{has given}} way to her, and, of course, <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> their bodies, but there is {{something}} so noble about her that I cannot but believe that she will one day shake herself clear of her little absurdities." ...|$|R
50|$|After Violet has a {{miscarriage}} in the bath, she finally decides {{to leave the}} mansion once and for all. It is revealed that Grace is now pregnant, suggesting that she got what she wanted all along. The film ends with a heavily pregnant Grace knitting a babygrow. Her father appears next to the cot she has out prepared, but as <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> <b>she</b> simply opens a window {{and goes back to}} her knitting, suggesting she has finally moved on from her childhood.|$|R
50|$|Other deleted {{scenes were}} shot {{to wrap up}} many characters' stories after the earthquake. Walt Russell and Dr. Stockle - whose fates are {{undetermined}} after the quake in the theatrical release - were shown alive in the seismology laboratory post-quake. They were shown finding the earthquake's magnitude to be 9.9 on the Richter scale. The film's final scene originally had Denise asking Lew Slade if Stewart had survived; upon hearing of his death, <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> to Corry who has regained consciousness.|$|R
60|$|She {{came into}} the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command the respect of any lunatic, for {{easiness}} is one of the qualities mad people most respect. <b>She</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> to him, smiling pleasantly, and held out her hand.|$|E
60|$|Tucked {{under the}} writing-table {{a pair of}} yellow and gold Turkish {{slippers}} of a highly meretricious quality caught her eye. <b>She</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> to them still carrying the trousers in her hands, and stooped to examine them. They were ingenious disguises of gilt paper destructively gummed, it would seem, to Ann Veronicas' best dancing-slippers.|$|E
60|$|Some {{detached}} instinct {{made her}} {{aware that she}} was gazing at a book which belonged by rights to some {{other part of the}} house. <b>She</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> to the shelf, took it down, and returned to her seat, placing the book on the table between them. Ralph opened it and looked at the portrait of a man with a voluminous white shirt-collar, which formed the frontispiece.|$|E
50|$|Max {{pulls into}} a parking garage and {{witnesses}} {{a father and son}} getting into a physical disagreement. <b>She</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> to them, insisting the father back off. The father knocks her out as the son records the scene. The father brings Max to a room where he ties her up by her hands, leaving her dangling from the ceiling. After Ryan gets a copy of the little boy's video on his phone, he brings it to the FBI. Weston returns to assist in finding Max.|$|R
50|$|Riley Bloom is a twelve-year-old {{girl who}} was about to become a {{teenager}} before she died in a car accident. She didnt cross over to heaven after the death of her and her family as she wanted to stay with her big sister - Ever Bloom - who was neither dead or alive after the accident as she had become immortal. Later, due to the force of her sister, <b>she</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> the bridge to heaven. There she meets her Mom, Dad and her pet dog Buttercup. And its from here the journey starts.|$|R
5000|$|Terry is crushed, {{but then}} remembers the pie eating contest. She goes to Duncanty's house and gets {{him to go}} to the contest with her. They go to the contest together. Terry wins and is happy, but then sees Duncanty talking to another girl and gets jealous. <b>She</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> to them and pushes the girl down into the mud and tells Duncanty that she needs him instead of Brett and that Duncanty is the only boy she will ride the Ferris wheel with. They share a kiss.|$|R
60|$|Still, {{in spite}} of these doubts, misgivings, fears, <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> towards the chest of drawers with a firm and rhythmical tread, to the bars of the {{internal}} music that rang loud through her brain, and began opening one drawer after another in an aimless fashion. She was looking for something--she didn't know what; and she never could rest now until she'd found it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Give him another," [...] she said, looking Jonathan in the face; {{and when}} that had been done, <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> to the chimney and flung the guilty piece into the reddest of the fire. Its base {{constituents}} began immediately to run; even as she watched it the disc crumbled, and the lineaments of the King became confused. Jonathan, who had followed close behind, beheld these changes from over her shoulder, and his face darkened sorely.|$|E
60|$|As she {{finished}} her work by placing a chair {{on each side of}} the table, a quiet smile, the result of a train of thought in which she had been indulging for the past half-hour, stole over her face. She passed through the kitchen, with a glance at the stove to see if the tea-kettle had begun to boil; and going out of the back door, <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> to the shed where her brother was splitting kindling-wood.|$|E
50|$|The video {{begins with}} Pitbull leaving {{a car and}} {{entering}} a club. The video shows people dancing in black and white, and people firebreathing, along with Marbles, Baker, and Furlan dancing by Pitbull. Pitbull sees a woman (Alejandra Espinoza) coming down stairs and, when she enters the main room, the video turns to color. The woman {{looks very much like}} Jessica Rabbit. Many men (usually with women) stare at her. <b>She</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> to Pitbull; they go to a dressing room and passionately make out. The video then ends with Pitbull and the girl leaving the club in his car.|$|R
5000|$|They {{free the}} imprisoned cats, {{set fire to}} the lighthouse, and leave with the prisoners for home. The mood {{immediately}} becomes lighthearted again, as the city regains its artistic merit. The poet is sure to point out that he is no more famous or revered as he was before the incident - just an [...] "anonymity". He is just glad to be able to listen to the sounds of music coming from the streets. As he finishes his typing, just before the story ends, the singer he was enamored with is seen in his room. <b>She</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> to him and affectionately strokes his chin, implying a happy ending for the poet.|$|R
5|$|Maggie is the {{youngest}} child of Homer and Marge, and sister to Bart and Lisa. She is often seen sucking on her red pacifier and, when <b>she</b> <b>walks,</b> <b>she</b> trips <b>over</b> her clothing and falls on her face (this running gag is used much more in earlier seasons). Being an infant, she cannot talk. She is a counterpart to Lisa Simpson. However, she did appear to talk in the first Tracey Ullman Show short.|$|R
6000|$|All {{this set}} her {{thinking}} to some purpose. One day <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> {{to the farm}} {{and made her way}} quietly to the back door. By good fortune she found blind Nora hemming napkins and in a mood to converse. Nora was an especially neat seamstress, but required some one to thread her needles. Mary the cook had been doing this, but now Mrs. Clark sat down beside Nora to [...] "hev a little talk" [...] and keep the needles supplied with thread.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; Mark must bid him not come. He {{will not}} wish to pain me when it can do no good. Look here, Mark;" [...] and <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> to her brother, and put both her hands upon his arm. [...] "I do love Lord Lufton. I had no such meaning or thought when I first knew him. But I do love him--I love him dearly;--almost as well as Fanny loves you, I suppose. You may tell him so if you think proper--nay, you must tell him so, or he will not {{understand}} me. But tell him this, as coming from me: that I will never marry him, unless his mother asks me." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{respect to}} Tiger, however, {{the end of}} the voyage was {{unfortunately}} not so propitious. In the confusion of the landing she was forgotten, and left behind; and Jennie was so excited and overjoyed at meeting her mother, that it was nearly noon before she thought of the kitten at all. Her father then sent Alfred on board the ship {{to see if he could}} get her. He came back with the cage, but he said that the kitten was nowhere to be found. He made diligent inquiry, but he could obtain no tidings of her--and no tidings were ever afterward heard. Whether she fell overboard and was drowned; or whether the waiters on the ship took a fancy to her, and hid her away somewhere in the forecastle, in order to keep her for their pet and plaything in future voyages; or whether <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> the plank to the pier, when the ship came alongside of it, and there got enticed away by the Liverpool cats into the various retreats and recesses which they resort to among the docks and sewers,--could never be known. At all events, neither Jennie nor Rollo ever saw or heard of her again.|$|E
6000|$|The youth {{sank back}} again baffled by this all-inclosing acceptance. [...] "What {{do you intend}} to do to-day?" [...] he asked, as <b>she</b> rose and <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> to the little walnut table.|$|R
50|$|Carter visits Earth Regina's grave. Earth Morrow informs {{him that}} she died after an unnaturally violent storm. Carter reckons that was when they came into orbit and his Regina died, too. Morrow does not feel this is a coincidence. During this, the two Helenas meet. They reflect on how they were once one person, but are now two {{separate}} individuals existing at the same time. Earth Helena knows her life here is at an end. 'Death' {{is a means of}} returning to herself and to those she loves—especially her husband, John Koenig. She leaves the living unit to find him. <b>She</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> to Koenig and, without a word, they share one tender kiss before she dies in his arms.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can drive}} her over. It {{is a long}} walk, and I had {{made up my mind}} to get Runciman's little phaeton. I shall order it for to-morrow if Miss Masters will come." [...] But Miss Masters would not agree to this. <b>She</b> would <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> again some day as <b>she</b> liked the <b>walk,</b> but no doubt she would only be in the way if she were to come often.|$|R
6000|$|They {{started off}} side by side. The first emotion of their meeting having passed away, {{he found it}} easier to talk to her, and he did so in an odd monosyllabic way which she yet found interesting. All her life she had been {{somewhat}} peculiarly situated with regard to companionship. Her father, having once taken her abroad and once to London for the season, considered that he had done his duty to her, and having himself long ago settled down to the life of a country squire, had expected her to be content with her position as his daughter and the mistress of his establishment. There was nothing particularly revolting to her in the prospect. She was not by any means emancipated. The [...] "new woman" [...] would have been a horror to her. But, unfortunately, although she was content to accept a comparatively narrow view of life, she was slightly epicurean in her tastes. She would have been quite willing to give up her life to a round of such pleasures as society and wealth can procure, but the society must be good and entertaining, and its pleasures must be refined and free from monotony. In some parts of England she might have found what would have satisfied her, and under the influence of a pleasure-seeking life, she would in due course have become the woman of a type. As she grew older the horizon of her life would have become more limited and her ideas narrower. She would have lived without tasting either the full sweetness or the full bitterness of life. She would have filled her place in society admirably, and there would have been nothing to distinguish her either for better or worse from other women in a similar position. But it happened that round Thurwell Court the people were singularly uninteresting. The girls were dull, and the men bucolic. Before she had spent two years in the country, Helen was intensely bored. A sort of chronic languor seemed to creep over her, and in a fit of desperation she had permitted herself to become engaged to Sir Geoffrey Kynaston, {{for the simple reason that}} he was different from the other men. Then, just as she was beginning to tremble at the idea of marriage with a man for whom she had never felt a single spark of love, there had come this tragedy, and, following close upon it, the vague consciousness of an utter change hovering over her life. What that change meant she was slow to discover. She was still unconscious of it as <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> the cliffs with the grey mists hanging around them, side by side with her father's tenant. She knew that life had somehow become a fairer thing to her, and that for many years she had been living in darkness. And it was her companion, this mysterious stranger with his wan young face and sad thoughtful eyes, who had brought the light. She could see it flashing across the whole landscape of her future, revealing the promise of a larger life than any she had ever dreamed of, full of brilliant possibilities and more perfect happiness than any she had ever imagined. She told herself that he was the Columbus who had shown her the new land of culture, with all its fair places, intellectual and artistic. This was the whole meaning of the change in her. There could be nothing else.|$|E
5000|$|Tontine - a {{chestnut}} mare foaled in 1822 and sired by Election. <b>She</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> for the 1000 Guineas Stakes in 1825 and {{was later}} also a broodmare for the Duke of Grafton.|$|E
50|$|Like in 1804, Parasol {{started the}} 1805 {{season in the}} Second Class of the Oatlands Stakes. She started the race as the favourite, but could only finish third, behind winner Giles and runner-up Duxbury. On 30 April at the Newmarket First Spring meeting she {{finished}} last of the three runners, behind winner Walton, in a £50 Subscription race over one mile. Later in the day <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> for the King's Plate for five-year-old mares. On 1 May she won a £50 Subscription, where Hippocampus finished second and Houghton Lass third. At the Second Spring meeting she faced Walton and Petruchio in the Jockey-Club Plate. Walton started the race as the 4/6 favourite, with Parasol second in the betting at 7/4. Parasol won the race from Walton, with Petruchio finishing last. After a few months off, Parasol returned to the track for the First October meeting. On {{the first day of}} the meeting <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> for a Subscription of 5 guineas each, before collecting a forfeit from Pipylin. Two days later <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> for a race work 50 guineas over the four-mile Beacon course. Another day later <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> to win the King's Plate for the second year running. At the Second October meeting she beat Sir Harry Dimsdale to win a race for One-third Subscription of 25 guineas each over the Beacon course. This turned out to be her last race of the season, as she was withdrawn from the October Oatlands Stakes.|$|E

Being an infant, she cannot talk. She is a counterpart to Lisa Simpson. However, she did appear to talk in the first Tracy Ullman short. Therefore, she is the least seen and heard member of the Simpson family.|$|R
50|$|Anne {{sees the}} gardener, takes off all her clothes, {{approaches}} him and seduces him into {{having sex with}} her in the greenhouse. Meanwhile, Helen goes to Mara's room and tells her that she can join the others if she wants and says that she will check on her later. Dr. Austin is told that Anne is missing, and the attendants go to find her. After having sex with Anne, the gardener tells her that she must leave for he will suffer the consequences of their tryst. Anne does not want to leave, so the gardener smacks her. Anne hits him back, calmly puts her clothes back on and leaves. <b>She</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> and kisses the male attendants that find her until Austin calls her to stop. Meanwhile, Cheryl asks Dr. Clay if she will be like she was before, and the doctor tells her that she has been cured.|$|R
5000|$|Birdlace is then shown {{getting off}} of a Greyhound bus in San Francisco. Discharged from the Marines, he is walking with a limp (presumably from his {{injuries}} from the explosion), and {{it is suggested that}} his three friends were all killed. He is taken by how much things have changed in the three years since he was last there, with hippies and flower children everywhere. He walks to the neighborhood where Rose's coffee shop is, and goes to a bar across the street to have a drink. The bartender tells him that Rose's mother has turned the coffee shop over to Rose. He then makes his way across the street and into the coffee shop. Rose, not having heard from him in three years, is surprised to see him, and can only say [...] "hi". <b>She</b> <b>walks</b> <b>over</b> to him, and they fall into an ambiguous embrace, as the film ends.|$|R
50|$|Queen of Trumps {{returned}} to Holywell for her final {{appearance of the}} season. On 13 October <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> for the Chieftain Stakes over the Mostyn mile course after the two other entries were withdrawn.|$|E
50|$|A {{native of}} Louisville, Kentucky, Yocum {{met his wife}} Mareike in Germany. He {{proposed}} marriage {{to her on the}} 100th mile of the hike, and they were married at mile 256. <b>She</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> 4,000 miles with him {{during the course of the}} walk.|$|E
50|$|After {{traversing}} {{the front}} lawn and having Kasabian search for an open window to the main house, Watson cut the screen of a window. Watson told Kasabian to keep watch down by the gate; <b>she</b> <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> to Steven Parent's AMC Ambassador and waited. He then removed the screen, entered through the window, and let Atkins and Krenwinkel in through the front door.|$|E
60|$|Whatever {{else she}} did, she {{must go back}} and pack. She must pack her two boxes, and leave them ready. For she felt that once she had left, she could never come back to Woodhouse again. If England had cliffs all round--why, when there was {{nowhere else to go}} and no getting beyond, <b>she</b> could <b>walk</b> <b>over</b> one of the cliffs. Meanwhile, she had her short run before her. She banked hard on her independence.|$|R
60|$|She was by {{no means}} easy in her mind. She loved Nostromo. She turned her eyes upon Giselle, sitting at a distance, with {{something}} of maternal tenderness, and the jealous anguish of a rival outraged in her defeat. Then <b>she</b> rose and <b>walked</b> <b>over</b> to her.|$|R
50|$|Baba Yaga {{appears as}} a hideous, old, human-like woman, some five feet tall. <b>She</b> <b>walks</b> {{crouched}} <b>over,</b> and her limbs are almost skeletal. Her skin is grayish brown, and tattooed with magical runes. She has a protruding chin, a long nose covered in warts, and ice-cold black eyes framed by stringy white hair. Her fingers end in sharp iron claws, her stony teeth are filed to sharp points, and two large, tusk-like teeth protrude from her jaw.|$|R
