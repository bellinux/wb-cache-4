500|$|In 1975 Bundy shifted {{much of his}} {{criminal}} activity eastward, from his base in Utah to Colorado. On January 12, a 23-year-old registered nurse named Caryn Eileen Campbell disappeared while walking down a well-lit hallway between the elevator and her room at the Wildwood Inn (now the Wildwood Lodge) in Snowmass Village, [...] southeast of Salt Lake City. Her nude body was found a month later next to a dirt road just outside the resort. She {{had been killed by}} blows to her head from a blunt instrument that left distinctive linear grooved depressions on her skull; her body also bore deep cuts from a <b>sharp</b> <b>weapon.</b> A hundred miles (160km) northeast of Snowmass, on March 15, Vail ski instructor Julie Cunningham, 26, disappeared while walking from her apartment to a dinner date with a friend. Bundy later told Colorado investigators that he approached Cunningham on crutches and asked her to help carry his ski boots to his car, where he clubbed and handcuffed her, then assaulted and strangled her at a secondary site near Rifle, Colorado, [...] west of Vail. Weeks later, he made the six-hour drive from Salt Lake City to revisit her remains.|$|E
500|$|The show {{opened with}} Sabu versus Abyss in the (first-ever) [...] "Barbed Wire Massacre", {{in which the}} ring ropes were {{replaced}} with barbed wire, {{and the only way}} to win was by pinfall or submission. James Mitchell accompanied Abyss to the ring. The duration of the contest was 10 minutes and 59 seconds. Early in the bout Sabu was pushed face-first into the barbed wire ropes as a result of Abyss kicking out of a pin attempt. Later, Abyss lifted up and dropped Sabu face-first into the barbed wire ropes. After this Sabu used a <b>sharp</b> <b>weapon,</b> which he had hidden under his belt, to stab Abyss in the arm repeatedly. Abyss was next to fall into the barbed wire after Sabu tripped him as he ran. A barbed wire wrapped steel was introduced in the match, which Sabu used to bash Abyss over the head. A barbed wire covered board was pushed into the ring after this by Sabu, which Abyss used to lift up and drop Sabu on. Another barbed wire covered board was introduced following this, with Sabu causing Abyss to run into it. He then pushed Abyss onto the other one and covered him for the pin to win the encounter.|$|E

60|$|Meg Merrilies was, however, apprehended and examined. She denied {{strongly}} {{having been}} either at Derncleugh {{or in the}} wood of Warroch upon the day of Kennedy's death; and several of her tribe made oath in her behalf, {{that she had never}} quitted their encampment, which was in a glen about ten miles distant from Ellangowan. Their oaths were indeed little to be trusted to; but what other evidence could be had in the circumstances? There was one remarkable fact, and only one, which arose from her examination. Her arm appeared to be slightly wounded by the cut of a <b>sharp</b> <b>weapon,</b> and was tied up with a handkerchief of Harry Bertram's. But the chief of the horde acknowledged he had 'corrected her' that day with his whinger; she herself, and others, gave the same account of her hurt; and for the handkerchief, the quantity of linen stolen from Ellangowan during the last months of their residence on the estate easily accounted for it, without charging Meg with a more heinous crime.|$|E
6000|$|... "Seeing {{that he took}} {{no notice}} of my words, I dug my spurs into my horse and hurled myself against him; then {{at the very moment}} my horse struck his with a {{tremendous}} shock, I brought down my iron whip-handle with all the force that was in me upon his head. The blow rang as if I had struck upon an anvil, while at the same moment he, without swerving, clutched my cloak with both hands. I could feel that they were bony, hard hands, armed with long, crooked, sharp talons like an eagle's, which pierced through my cloak into my flesh. Dropping my whip, I seized him by the throat, which seemed scaly and hard, between my hands, and thus, locked together in a desperate struggle, we swayed this way and that, each trying to drag the other from his seat till we came down together with a crash upon the earth. In a moment we were disengaged and on our feet. Quick as lightning flashed out his long, <b>sharp</b> <b>weapon,</b> and, finding I was too late to draw mine, I hurled myselfagainst him, seizing his armed hand in both mine before he could strike.|$|E

6000|$|She answered, 'No mortal is able {{entirely to}} {{understand}} {{the power of this}} ring, because no one thoroughly understands the secret signs engraved upon it. But even with my half-knowledge I can work great wonders. If I put the ring upon the little finger of my left hand, then I can fly like a bird through the air wherever I wish to go. If I put it on the third finger of my left hand I am invisible, and I can see everything that passes around me, though no one can see me. If I put the ring upon the middle finger of my left hand, then neither fire nor water nor any <b>sharp</b> <b>weapon</b> can hurt me. If I put it on the forefinger of my left hand, then I can with its help produce whatever I wish. I can in a single moment build houses or anything I desire. Finally, as long as I wear the ring on the thumb of my left hand, that hand is so strong that it can break down rocks and walls. Besides these, the ring has other secret signs which, as I said, no one can understand. No doubt it contains secrets of great importance. The ring formerly belonged to King Solomon, the wisest of kings, during whose reign the wisest men lived. But it is not known whether this ring was ever made by mortal hands: it is supposed that an angel gave it to the wise King.' ...|$|E
60|$|The wounds were, one evidently given with a club, {{which had}} {{shattered}} {{the right side}} of the skull at the back, and probably was the first, and had destroyed life instantly, and almost painlessly; another stroke of some <b>sharp</b> <b>weapon</b> had cloven the top of the head; the body was also pierced in one place; and there were two arrow wounds in the legs, but apparently not shot at the living man, but stuck in after his fall, and after he had been stripped, for the clothing was gone, all but the boots and socks. In the front of the cocoa-nut palm, there were five knots made in the long leaflets. All this is an almost certain indication that his death was the vengeance for five of the natives. 'Blood for blood' is a sacred law, almost of nature, wherever Christianity has not prevailed, and a whole tribe is held responsible for the crime of one. Five men in Fiji are known to have been stolen from Nukapu; and probably their families believed them to have been killed, and believed themselves to be performing a sacred duty when they dipped their weapons in the blood of the Bisope, whom they did not know well enough to understand that he was their protector. Nay, it is likely that there had been some such discussion as had saved him before at Mai from suffering for Petere's death; and, indeed, one party seem to have wished to keep him from landing, and to have thus solemnly and reverently treated his body.|$|E
60|$|The {{words were}} barely uttered, when he {{encountered}} a savage of gigantic stature, {{and of the}} fiercest mien. At the same moment, Duncan found himself engaged with the other, in a similar contest of hand to hand. With ready skill, Hawkeye and his antagonist each grasped that uplifted arm of the other which held the dangerous knife. For near a minute they stood looking {{one another in the}} eye, and gradually exerting the power of their muscles for the mastery. At length, the toughened sinews of the white man prevailed over the less practised limbs of the native. The arm of the latter slowly gave way before the increasing force of the scout, who suddenly wresting his armed hand from the grasp of the foe, drove the <b>sharp</b> <b>weapon</b> through his naked bosom to the heart. In the meantime Heyward had been pressed in a more deadly struggle. His slight sword was snapped in the first encounter. As he was destitute of any other means of defence, his safety now depended entirely on bodily strength and resolution. Though deficient in neither of these qualities, he had met an enemy every way his equal. Happily, he soon succeeded in disarming his adversary, whose knife fell on the rock at their feet; and from this moment it became a fierce struggle, who should cast the other over the dizzy height into a neighboring cavern of the falls. Every successive struggle brought them nearer to the verge, where Duncan perceived the final and conquering effort must be made. Each of the combatants threw all his energies into that effort, and the result was, that both tottered on the brink of the precipice. Heyward felt the grasp of the other at his throat, and saw the grim smile the savage gave, under the revengeful hope that he hurried his enemy to a fate similar to his own, as he felt his body slowly yielding to a resistless power, and the young man experienced the passing agony of such a moment in all its horrors. At that instant of extreme danger, a dark hand and glancing knife appeared before him; the Indian released his hold, as the blood flowed freely from around the several tendons of the wrist; and while Duncan was drawn backward by the saving arm of Uncas, his charmed eyes were still riveted on the fierce and disappointed countenance of his foe, who fell sullenly and disappointed down the irrecoverable precipice.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{ascertain}} if a relationship between weapon choice and psychopathology existed. The perpetrators (103) were evaluated at the Department of Criminology and Forensic Psychiatry of the University of Bari in southern Italy.

The results showed a significant correlation between some types of mental disorder and weapon choice. A strong correlation was found between delusional disorders and the use of <b>sharp</b> <b>weapons,</b> whereas depressive disorders were more strongly associated with asphyxia. Organic disorders were found to be highly correlated with the use of blunt instruments.
