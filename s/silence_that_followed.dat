25|$|On 21 May 1971, Kamanin {{arrived at}} Baikonur {{for his last}} mission launch. Soyuz 11 lifted off 6 June, docked with the station, and {{completed}} the program, but the crew was killed by decompression on their landing run. Kamanin was at the mission control at Eupatoria throughout their fatal descent and left his own transcript of conversation and the <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{moment of}} <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed</b> was {{extraordinary}} in its hostility.|$|E
60|$|He stopped, {{and felt}} falling, {{falling through the}} aching <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed.</b>|$|E
60|$|His cries are {{at times}} awful, but the <b>silences</b> <b>that</b> <b>follow</b> are more deadly still, for he means murder in every turn and movement.|$|R
6000|$|... [In the <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> <b>follows,</b> a clock begins loudly {{striking}} [...] twelve. ANN remains, as if {{carved in}} atone, her eyes fastened [...] on the strangers. There {{is the sound}} of someone falling [...] downstairs, and WELLWYN appears, also holding a candle above his [...] head.] ...|$|R
50|$|Rudra {{is in all}} men, omnipresent, he was born, {{and he will be}} born, he is in all {{the world}} spaces, begins chapter 5. One Rudra there is, states the Upanishad, and he has no second. He dwells in all living beings, and they return in him when they end. Through him, the whole {{universe}} spreads out. Whoever knows him, enters peace. He is unity, he is eternal, he is energy, he is Om, he is <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> <b>follows</b> Om.|$|R
60|$|My father {{broke the}} <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed,</b> {{addressing}} {{himself to the}} bailiff.|$|E
60|$|Then in the <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed</b> the Alcalde {{filled his}} glass again.|$|E
60|$|In the {{momentary}} <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed,</b> {{they heard a}} double knock at the house-door.|$|E
60|$|Absolute <b>silence</b> <b>followed</b> <b>that</b> statement. Presently it {{was broken}} by a {{rattling}} of loose gravel and then low voices.|$|R
60|$|Sudden {{and utter}} <b>silence</b> <b>followed</b> <b>that</b> exhortation. Asad listened in {{relieved}} amazement; Rosamund {{caught her breath}} in sheer dismay.|$|R
60|$|A dead <b>silence</b> <b>followed</b> <b>that</b> strange prayer; then Bianca, {{with tears}} rolling down her face, {{got up and}} rushed out of the room.|$|R
60|$|And as {{he looked}} he {{understood}} the sigh, and also the death-like <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed.</b>|$|E
60|$|In {{the moment}} of <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed,</b> Mr. Moy {{interfered}} {{in the interests of}} his client.|$|E
60|$|In the <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed</b> {{his words}} {{the door opened}} and closed and he was gone.|$|E
6000|$|An obstinate <b>silence</b> <b>followed</b> <b>that</b> threat. Massy {{moved away}} perplexed. On the bank two figures appeared, {{approaching}} the gangway. He {{heard a voice}} tinged with contempt-- ...|$|R
60|$|I think I {{never heard}} a denser <b>silence</b> than <b>that</b> which <b>followed</b> this invitation. Each of the indunas looked at his neighbour, but {{not one of them}} uttered a single word.|$|R
60|$|<b>Silence</b> <b>followed</b> <b>that</b> question. Mr. Vanborough's face betrayed {{signs of}} embarrassment. He poured himself out {{another glass of}} wine, and drank it at a draught before he replied.|$|R
60|$|But {{the dead}} <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed</b> was more painful and marked {{than it had}} been before.|$|E
60|$|In the {{amazed and}} rather scared <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed</b> he {{surveyed}} {{them for a}} moment before resuming.|$|E
60|$|The <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed</b> {{my words}} was as oppressive as the silence which in Nature preludes thunder.|$|E
5000|$|The band drew {{inspiration}} for the album from House of Leaves and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. During an online Q&A session on April 20, 2010, Brendan dismissed the claim that Juturna was a concept album based on Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, but did {{say that there is}} an underlying concept. That concept is speculated by fans to be vaguely about human memories. [...] "Oh, Hello" [...] exemplifies this with its lyrics. The decision to call the album's bonus track that appears after [...] "Meet Me In Montauk" [...] and the <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> <b>follows</b> it at 8:56, [...] "House of Leaves" [...] was more or less a joint one by the band and their fans. Various members of the band have stated that they have read at least some portion of the book over the years since its 2000 release.|$|R
60|$|We take {{advantage}} of the momentary <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> <b>follows</b> to introduce ourselves by name to our host, and to inform him of the circumstances under which we happen to be visiting Shetland. He listens in his subdued, courteous way; but he makes no inquiries about our relatives; he shows no interest in the arrival of the Government yacht and the Commissioner for Northern Lights. All sympathy with the doings of the outer world, all curiosity about persons of social position and notoriety, is evidently at an end in Mr. Dunross. For twenty years the little round of his duties and his occupations has been enough for him. Life has lost its priceless value to this man; and when Death comes to him he will receive the king of terrors as he might receive the last of his guests.|$|R
60|$|While {{this brief}} {{conversation}} passed, Donatello had {{once or twice}} glanced aside with a watchful air, just as a hound may often be seen to take sidelong note of some suspicious object, while he gives his more direct attention to something nearer at, hand. Miriam seemed now first {{to become aware of}} the <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> had <b>followed</b> upon the cheerful talk and laughter of a few moments before.|$|R
60|$|In the {{interval}} of <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed,</b> I was reminded that an unseen friend was keeping watch outside.|$|E
60|$|In the <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed</b> {{there was}} a murmur of voices, and then they came into the passage.|$|E
60|$|The {{half-brother}} waited uncomfortably in the <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed,</b> {{during which}} Percival Ford coolly considered his next utterance.|$|E
60|$|A gasp went {{round the}} room, {{a sigh of}} astonishment, of horror, of anticipation, and in the <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> {{immediately}} <b>followed,</b> the proverbial pin would have been heard to drop: every rustle of a silken gown, every creak of a shoe sounded clear and distinct, as did the quickly-suppressed sneer that escaped Gaston de Stainville's lips and the frou-frou of his satin coat sleeve as he raised the gold-rimmed glass to his eye.|$|R
60|$|In the <b>silence</b> which <b>followed</b> <b>that</b> discovery, a first {{flash of}} {{lightning}} passed across {{the window and the}} low roll of thunder sounded the outbreak of the storm.|$|R
60|$|Dead <b>silence</b> <b>followed</b> <b>that</b> bombshell of opposition, {{coming from}} a quarter whence it was least expected. For Catherine and Anjou had {{confidently}} counted upon the Duke's hatred of Coligny to ensure his support of their designs.|$|R
60|$|During {{the short}} <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed,</b> Whitney looked round the great church {{that was still}} majestic in its decay.|$|E
60|$|The <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed</b> {{was broken}} only by the majorâ€™s low growls. The poor man already knew his fate.|$|E
60|$|The {{white horse}} {{was the only}} one to break the <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> <b>followed,</b> by {{sneezing}} with all his might.|$|E
60|$|The hum of voices, the clink of coin, {{the loud}} {{laughter}} had ceased. There was a <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> manifestly had <b>followed</b> some unusual word or action sufficient to still the room. It {{was broken by}} a harsh curse and the scrape of a bench on the floor. Some man had risen.|$|R
500|$|The album {{contains}} three secret tracks placed {{onto the}} twelfth track after <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> <b>follows</b> the track's primary song [...] "(The Return of) The Electric Horseman". The {{first of these}} is called [...] "Vladimir" [...] which, according to Fanning is about a transvestite. The second song is called [...] "SS" [...] which refers to Australian cricket bat manufacturer Stuart Surridge, which is often known by those initials. The song refers {{in part to the}} bat itself, though mostly to cricket in general, with lyrics [...] "Then we'll race like jets for the fading moon; Then we all fall down", which refers to running for the opposite crease following striking the ball, and then diving to the ground to secure the run. The third and final secret track is called [...] "Come Away" [...] which also appeared as a B-side for the single of [...] "Pick You Up". In a first for the group, it had the guitarist Darren Middleton as lead vocalist, while a spoken sound sample {{at the end of the}} song is the bass guitarist John Collins' voice.|$|R
60|$|A <b>silence</b> <b>followed</b> <b>that</b> impassioned speech. Lodi {{remained}} standing, {{the others}} sat, their eager glances turned upon the Count, their ears anxiously alert for his reply. Thus they remained {{for a brief}} spell, Aquila himself so still that he scarcely seemed to breathe.|$|R
