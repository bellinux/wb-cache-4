5|$|A {{disappointed}} Oliphant {{flew to the}} United States {{to speak}} to the American scientists. These included Ernest Lawrence at the University of California's Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley. The two men had met before the war, and were friends. Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium. Uranium-235 makes up only about 0.72% of natural uranium, so the <b>separation</b> <b>factor</b> of any uranium enrichment process needs to be higher than 1250 to produce 90% uranium-235 from natural uranium. The Maud Committee had recommended that this be done by a process of gaseous diffusion, but Oliphant had pioneered another technique in 1934: electromagnetic separation. This was the process that Nier had used.|$|E
5|$|The {{reaction}} yield {{is about}} 2% of the radium weight. 227Ac can further capture neutrons resulting {{in small amounts}} of 228Ac. After the synthesis, actinium is separated from radium and from the products of decay and nuclear fusion, such as thorium, polonium, lead and bismuth. The extraction can be performed with thenoyltrifluoroacetone-benzene solution from an aqueous solution of the radiation products, and the selectivity to a certain element is achieved by adjusting the pH (to about 6.0 for actinium). An alternative procedure is anion exchange with an appropriate resin in nitric acid, which {{can result in a}} <b>separation</b> <b>factor</b> of 1,000,000 for radium and actinium vs. thorium in a two-stage process. Actinium can then be separated from radium, with a ratio of about 100, using a low cross-linking cation exchange resin and nitric acid as eluant.|$|E

40|$|The {{recovery}} of tritium from tritiated water {{is important for}} the safe handling of a large amount of tritium required in thermonuclear fusion devices and heavy water moderated fission reactors. Among a variety of techniques, photocatalytic decomposition of water is attractive because tritium in tritiated water is enriched here by use of the solar energy. From this viewpoint, the kinetics and <b>separation</b> <b>factors</b> for hydrogen evolution from H 2 O-HTO and H 2 O-D 2 O systems over Pt/TiO 2 catalyst were investigated. The <b>separation</b> <b>factors</b> defined with the initial reaction rate were αRo (H 2 O-D 2 O) = 5. 1 ± 0. 05 and βRo (H 2 O-HTO) = 15. 4 ± 0. 2. They were independent of the mixing ratio of the isotope waters but gradually decreased to steady values when a closed experimental system was used. The <b>separation</b> <b>factors</b> defined with the steady state were αe(H 2 O-HDO) = 3. 6 ± 0. 05, αe(D 2 O-HDO) = 3. 0 ± 0. 05, and βe(H 2 O-HTO) = 6. 2 ± 0. 05. In addition, hydrogen evolution was found to be considerably enhanced by the synergistic effect of β-rays and photons. The <b>separation</b> <b>factors,</b> αRo and βRo, agreed with those predicted by theoretical calculation for catalytic model in electrolysis indicating that the rate determining step is the association reaction of hydrogen atoms absorbed on Pt surface.

25|$|The gas {{centrifuge}} process uses {{a large number}} of rotating cylinders in series and parallel formations. Each cylinder's rotation creates a strong centripetal force so that the heavier gas molecules containing 238U move tangentially toward the outside of the cylinder and the lighter gas molecules rich in 235U collect closer to the center. It requires much less energy to achieve the same separation than the older gaseous diffusion process, which it has largely replaced and so is the current method of choice and is termed second generation. It has a <b>separation</b> <b>factor</b> per stage of 1.3 relative to gaseous diffusion of 1.005, which translates to about one-fiftieth of the energy requirements. Gas centrifuge techniques produce about 54% of the world's enriched uranium.|$|E

In July 1940, Ross Gunn from the United States Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) showed him a 1939 paper on the subject by Harold Urey, and Abelson became intrigued by the possibility of using the liquid thermal diffusion process.

40|$|The metal-organic {{frameworks}} MIL- 47 ((VO) -O-IV{O 2 C-C 6 H 4 -CO 2 }) and MIL- 53 (Al) (Al-III(OH) center dot{O 2 C-C 6 H 4 -CO 2 }) {{are capable}} of separating ethylbenzene and styrene. Both materials adsorb up to 20 - 24 wt % of both compounds. Despite {{the fact that they}} have identical building schemes, the reason for preferential adsorption of styrene compared to ethylbenzene is very different for the two frameworks. For MIL- 47, diffraction experiments reveal that styrene is packed inside the pores in a unique, pairwise fashion, resulting in <b>separation</b> <b>factors</b> as high as 4 in favor of styrene. These <b>separation</b> <b>factors</b> are independent of the total amount of adsorbate offered. This is due to co-adsorption of ethylbenzene in the space left available between the packed styrene pairs. The separation is of a non-enthalpic nature. On MIL- 53, the origin of the preferential adsorption of styrene is related to differences in enthalpy of adsorption, which are based on different degrees of framework relaxation. The proposed adsorption mechanisms are in line with the influence of temperature on the <b>separation</b> <b>factors</b> derived from pulse chromatography: <b>separation</b> <b>factors</b> are independent of temperature for MIL- 47 but vary with temperature for MIL- 53.

Experimental data on distribution coefficients and <b>separation</b> <b>factors</b> (SFs) for 47 such ligands have been obtained and show SF values ranging from 0. 61 to 100. The ligands were divided into a training set of 36 molecules to develop the QSAR and a test set of 11 molecules to validate the QSAR. Over 1500 molecular descriptors were calculated for each heterocycle and the Genetic Algorithm was used to select the most appropriate for use in multiple regression equations. Equations were developed fitting the <b>separation</b> <b>factors</b> to 6 - 8 molecular descriptors which gave r(2) values of > 0. 8 for the training set and values of > 0. 7 for the test set, thus showing good predictive quality.
