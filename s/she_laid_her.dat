25|$|When Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon {{married the}} future King George VI on 26 April 1923, <b>she</b> <b>laid</b> <b>her</b> bouquet at the Tomb {{on her way}} into the Abbey, as a tribute to her brother Fergus who had died at the Battle of Loos in 1915 (and whose name was then listed among those of the missing on the Loos Memorial, {{although}} in 2012 a new headstone was erected in the Quarry Cemetery, Vermelles). Royal brides married at the Abbey now have their bouquets laid on the tomb the day after the wedding and all of the official wedding photographs have been taken. It is also the only tomb not to have been covered by a special red carpet for the wedding of Prince Albert, Duke of York, and Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon.|$|E

[...] While she cried, she kissed the casket and said [...] "I love you". Her children surrounded her, and attempted to console her. Nancy then walked away with her military escort, clutching the folded flag. The military band began to play the Victorian hymn [...] "My Faith Looks Up to Thee" [...] as the Reagan children said their goodbyes. Funeral attendees had an opportunity to file past the coffin.|$|E

500|$|When World War I began, Admiral Makarov was {{assigned}} to the First Cruiser Brigade. On 17 August, the ship, together with the armored cruiser , encountered two German light cruisers and an auxiliary minelayer near the entrance to the Gulf of Finland en route to lay a minefield at the entrance. The Russian commander refused combat because he mistakenly thought that the Germans had two additional armored cruisers with them. Shortly afterward, Admiral Makarov was modified to carry mines. <b>She</b> <b>laid</b> <b>her</b> first mines in early December when she was {{one of a group of}} ships that mined the northern and western entrances to the Gulf of Danzig.
