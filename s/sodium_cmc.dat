Tablets formulated employing <b>sodium</b> <b>CMC</b> and HPMC alone were slowly eroded and were dissolved completely within 4 - 5 hr.

The resistance to the carrier matrix for the diffusion and transport of drugs, however, is routinely ignored. This study reports a promising and attractive approach to reducing the resistance to drug transport in the carrier matrix, to enhance drug permeability and bioavailability via enhanced concentration-gradient of the driving force for transdermal purposes. This approach simply optimizes and reconstructs the porous channel structure of the carrier matrix, namely, poloxamer 407 (P 407) -based hydrogel matrix blended with carboxymethyl cellulose <b>sodium</b> (<b>CMCs).</b> Addition of CMCs was found to distinctly improve the porous structure of the P 407 matrix.

The aim of this study was to formulate a mucoadhesive gel from the seed hull of Quercus brantii and fruits of Coriandrum sativum for the treatment of periodontitis. Materials and Methods: The semisolid concentrated extracts were incorporated in gel base. Mucoadhesive gels were prepared using carbopol 940, sodium carboxymethylcellulose (<b>sodium</b> <b>CMC)</b> and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose K 4 M (HPMC) as bioadhesive polymers. Physicochemical tests, mucoadhesive strength measurement and in vitro drug release study were carried out on two formulations containing carbopol 940 and <b>sodium</b> <b>CMC</b> polymers (Formulations F 4 and F 5). We investigated the antibacterial activity of formulation F 5 against Porphyromonas gingivalis using the disk diffusion method on supplemented Brucella agar. Results: Eight gel formulations were prepared. Physical appearance, homogeneity and consistency of F 4 and F 5 were good. Mucoadhesion and viscosity of F 5 (1 % carbopol 940 and 3 % <b>sodium</b> <b>CMC)</b> was more than F 4 (0. 5 % carbopol 940 and 3 % <b>sodium</b> <b>CMC).</b> Drug release from F 5 was slower.

The absence of strong interactions, the small variation in the glass transition temperature and the roughness detected in the cross-section micrographs of the 1 : 1 CMC:SA mixtures, indicated a partial miscibility among the components. As a consequence of the above-mentioned characteristics, film release of potassium was highest for the 1 : 1 CMC:SA mixture and lowest for SA. The release mechanism of K from the 1 : 1 CMC:SA mixture was controlled by a diffusion process, however, associated effects due to swelling and erosion of the matrix films, were observed for the pure CMC and SA systems.

In facts, velocity of solid grains can be detected via PIV techniques at the transparent walls of an open channel flow laboratory. However, the main interest arises from the possibility of making CMC-water solutions of desired dynamic viscosities. This allows establishing a double model of similitude by which the concentration of CMC, to be used in laboratory for the reproduction of a specific real debris flow event, can be derived. The relation between the dynamic viscosity, temperature and concentration is obtained for the prototype and, hence, for the model by a double regression on viscometric measurements...|$|R
30|$|For {{cellulase}} activity test, 5  µL of overnight grown {{culture was}} spot plated on carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) agar plate (0.2 % NaNO 3, 0.1 % K 2 HPO 4, 0.05 % MgSO 4, 0.05 % KCl, 0.2 % <b>CMC</b> <b>sodium</b> salt, 0.02 % peptone and 1.7 % agar). The plates were incubated at 37  °C for 48  h. They were then flooded with Gram’s iodine for 3 – 5  min and observed for a zone hydrolysis around bacterial colony.|$|R
30|$|For {{modification}} with gelatin, a 5 % solution (5 %, photographic gelatin type Restoration 1, GMW) was prepared. Freeze-dried BNC was pre-swollen and diluted in 97.5 % water {{followed by}} adding 2 % gelatin. During processing, the suspensions were agitated with a magnetic stirrer. In addition, a 2 % SCMC solution (<b>sodium</b> carboxymethylcellulose, Blanose™ <b>CMC</b> 7 H 3 SF PH, Ashland, USA) was tested on for modification as well. The fibre suspensions (0.5 and 1 %) were directly {{mixed with the}} SCMC solution.|$|R
