5|$|He {{then took}} 5/63 {{in the first}} innings of the Third Test at Headingley, {{removing}} Subba Row, May, Barrington and Ted Dexter {{at the top of}} the order, but Australia <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> bat and England lost only two wickets in reaching 62 in the second innings to level the series. Davidson took one of those wickets, removing Subba Row.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Clyde {{tried to}} restart {{his career with}} the Houston Astros, but he spent the season in the minor leagues {{splitting}} time between the Columbus Astros and Tucson Toros. He dominated for Columbus, having a 6–0 record with a 0.76 ERA, but <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Toros, having a 6.85 earned run average. Clyde retired from professional baseball on February 5, 1982, while participating in an instructional league.|$|E
5|$|In December2008, Eros International {{withdrew from}} funding the project after {{financial}} difficulties {{caused by the}} box-office failure of Drona (2008) and Yuvvraaj (2008), with the subsequent departure of Ayngaran International, which <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> global financial crisis of 2007–08. The film's production and release rights were sold to Sun Pictures.|$|E

5|$|Shuey <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Indians, with an 0–3 win–loss record, five saves, and 7.00 ERA in 21 {{appearances}} in 1994 and 1995.

He also pitched for the Senadores de San Juan of the Puerto Rico Baseball League that winter to gain more experience.|$|E
5|$|Another {{part of the}} machine's {{exhibition}} was {{the completion of the}} knight's tour, a famed chess puzzle. The puzzle requires the player to move a knight around a chessboard, touching each square once along the way. While most experienced chess players of the time still <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> puzzle, the Turk was capable of completing the tour without any difficulty from any starting point via a pegboard used by the director with a mapping of the puzzle laid out.|$|E
5|$|At Los Alamos, Bradbury became head of E-5, the Implosion Experimentation Group, {{which put}} him {{in charge of the}} {{implosion}} field test program. In August, the laboratory's director, Robert Oppenheimer, implemented a sweeping reorganisation. E-5 became part of George Kistiakowsky's new Explosives Division (X Division), and was renumbered X-1. At this point, Bradbury was leading some of the most critical work at the laboratory, as it <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> jets that spoiled the perfect spherical shape desired for the implosion process. These were examined with a combination of magnetic, X-ray and RaLa techniques.|$|E

5|$|Chambers' coach Mike McFarlane <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{workload}} {{of full-time}} training. Frustrated by {{the distance between}} himself and the top sprinters, Chambers decided to relocate to California to work with Ukrainian coach Remi Korchemny and nutritionist Victor Conte. After parting ways with American sprinter Tim Montgomery, Conte looked to Chambers to fill the athlete's berth. In the run up to the year's major events, Chambers was in fine form and recorded a 200m personal best of 20.27s in Athens on 10 June 2002. Montgomery, impressed by Chambers' training regime, tipped the Briton to win the gold at the forthcoming 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England.|$|E
5|$|During Q3, contested {{by the top}} ten, Hamilton just {{beat his}} {{teammate}} to pole position, with a time set during his first timed lap. Both Ferrari drivers ran their first lap on used tyres {{in order to save}} one set for the race. In their second outing, Vettel was able to get ahead of the two Williams cars of Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas, while teammate Kimi Räikkönen <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> handling of his car {{in the first part of}} the track to finish sixth on the grid.|$|E
5|$|During the {{planning}} of NG Life, Mizuho Kusanagi discussed with her editor about having a female lead protagonist allowing the readers to relate more to the protagonist. However, a male lead was settled for and the story was written in a romantic-panic comedy style. Kusanagi planned to end the series in its fourth volume, but wanted to add {{more to the story}} as it progressed resulting in more volumes. She also commented that even though she <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> plot, she enjoyed drawing the characters in the end. In the final chapter, the author revealed she had planned to pair Keidai with Mii since the beginning.|$|E

5|$|French {{civilian}} administrators <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> military leaders, {{and the two}} forces {{went through}} a number of leadership changes over the territory, until Louis Archinard was appointed military governor in 1892. Archinard led military campaigns against Samori Ture, Ahmadu Tall, and other resistant leaders in the region, with varying success. Archinard's campaigns were often executed through direct military control, without civilian oversight. As costs increased, the French administration decided to replace Archinard's control over the area with a civilian governor, Louis Albert Grodet.|$|E
5|$|Hammonds did {{not play}} professionally in 1992 as he competed for the United States {{national}} baseball team in the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. He faced a two-month road trip across sixteen states by bus, more travel combined with training than employed by any professional team. Hammonds <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> national team initially, but agreed to sign with the Orioles in July 1992, receiving a $975,000 signing bonus, the largest of any player chosen in that draft. Upon signing, his hitting improved.|$|E
5|$|He was {{recalled}} to the Test {{team as a}} wicket-keeper for the July 2008 tour of Sri Lanka after Dhoni {{chose to}} take a break from cricket, citing the need to rest. Karthik played in the first two Tests, but <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> bat in the middle-order, scoring 36 runs at 9.00, falling all four times to the spinners Muttiah Muralitharan and Ajantha Mendis. He also dropped frequent catches and he was replaced for the Third Test by Patel.|$|E

5|$|Key {{took his}} first wicket in {{first-class}} cricket {{on the final day}} of Kent's draw with Northamptonshire at the start of the 2009 season. He went on to score 1,209 runs that season, with four centuries including a career-best 270*, at 50.37 runs per innings. It was the sixth time he had passed one thousand runs in a season. He came close to beating this score the following season when, on 17 May 2010, he scored 261 against Durham. He had, until that match, <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> bat - averaging only 14.30 in the County Championship.|$|E
5|$|Stivetts <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> new {{distance}} initially; {{his first}} four starts {{of the season}} were largely ineffective. On April29, with the weather cold and rainy, he issued bases on balls to ten New York Giants batters, and surrendered 15runs. The next two starts were against Baltimore and he allowed seven runs to score the first game despite gaining the victory, and another 16runs in a loss in the second game. Another ten runs scored on May 10, in a loss versus the Washington Senators.|$|E

The ball gown worn by Baron was made especially for the serial and was the most expensive costume on display. The newspaper found by the Doctor in Part One was a reprint of The Times from September 1901, while the food and drink served during the party scenes was all real.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{study has}} Bertin standing and leaning {{on a table}} in an almost Napoleonic pose. His hard, level stare is already established, but the focus seems to be on his groin rather than his face. It is obvious that Ingres <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> sketch; the head is on a square of attached paper which must have replaced an earlier cut-out version, and other areas have been rubbed over and heavily reworked. The next extant drawing shows Bertin seated, but the chair is missing. The last extant sketch is the closest to the eventual painting, with a chair, though his bulk has not yet been filled out.|$|E
5|$|The idea to do a film {{adaptation}} of Susan Orlean's The Orchid Thief {{dates back to}} 1994. Fox 2000 purchased the film rights in 1997, eventually selling them to Jonathan Demme, who set the project at Columbia Pictures. Charlie Kaufman was hired to write the script, but <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> adaptation and writer's block. Kaufman eventually created a script of his experience in adaptation, exaggerating events, and creating a fictional brother named Donald Kaufman. Kaufman put Donald Kaufman's name on the script and dedicated the film to the fictional character. By September 1999, Kaufman had written two drafts of the script; he turned in a third draft in November 2000.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the six {{previous}} {{novels in}} the series, the titular character Harry Potter has <b>struggled</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> difficulties of adolescence along with being famous {{as the only}} wizard to survive the Killing Curse. The curse was cast by the evil Tom Riddle, better known as Lord Voldemort, a powerful evil wizard, who had murdered Harry's parents and attempted to kill Harry as a baby, in the belief this would frustrate a prophecy that Harry would become his equal. As an orphan, Harry {{was placed in the}} care of his Muggle (non-magical) relatives Petunia Dursley and Vernon Dursley.|$|E
