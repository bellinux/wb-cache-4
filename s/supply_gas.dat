5|$|Intrigued by {{the work}} of Frederick Winsor, who had been championing the {{introduction}} of gas lighting in London, Accum too, became fascinated by this innovation. At the request of the Gas Light and Coke Company, he carried out many experiments in this novel field of inquiry. After a time of close working association with this company, he became a member of its board of directors in 1812. The company was charged with founding the first gasworks in London to <b>supply</b> <b>gas</b> lighting to both private and public areas. Accum was instrumental in the conception and design of this extremely successful gasworks.|$|E

25|$|In 1872, Pacific Rolling Mills {{was joined}} in the Potrero by the City Gas Company, a coal {{gasification}} plant built to <b>supply</b> <b>gas</b> for lighting the city. Coal (and later fuel oil) steam generation was used to generate heat, power and electricity. The gas plant in the Potrero was for many years {{the largest and most}} important gas manufacturing plant in San Francisco. Construction began in 1870 on lots between Humboldt and Sierra streets (later renamed). Originally a coal-gas works, Springer water-gas generators were added in 1888. By 1905, PG had consolidated much of the power generation in the state, including the Potrero works. After the 1906 removal of the coal-gas retorts, the Potrero plant became an oil-gas facility. For fifty years the Potrero plant used gasification to drive steam turbines and power the city of San Francisco.|$|E

25|$|Work on the John F. Kennedy burial site {{continued}} {{over the}} next two and a half years. The Washington Gas and Light Company offered to build, maintain, and <b>supply</b> <b>gas</b> to the eternal flame at no expense. The final burner was a specially designed torch created by the Institute of Gas Technology with an electrical ignition which kept the flame lit in wind or rain and which fed the gas oxygen to create the correct color. A debate broke out between providers of bottled propane gas and line-fed natural gas as to which source of fuel should be used to supply the eternal flame. The debate was so vigorous that it broke out in public in March 1964. The cost of construction of the approaches, elliptical plaza, walls were estimated at $1.77 million in February 1965. The cost of construction of the actual grave site was estimated at $309,000. Fifteen firms were invited to bid on the construction contract and nine did so. A $1.4 million contract for construction was awarded to Aberthaw Construction in mid-July 1965. The Army Corps of Engineers consulted with the Kennedy family before letting the award. A second contract for structural design consulting in the amount of $71,026 went to Ammann & Whitney. At this time, contracts for the quotation inscriptions, the marble base for the flame, the bronze brazier, and the slate markers had yet to be let. The white marble for the plaza, terrace, and steps came from Proctor, Vermont, and the granite for the approaches came from Deer Isle, Maine.|$|E
500|$|The {{first route}} would have {{originated}} in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn {{at a point}} between 65th and 67th Streets (just south of 59th Street Station), running to Arrietta Street in Tompkinsville, Staten Island near the Tompkinsville Station and one stop away from the Saint George Terminal. This plan, referred to as [...] "Route No. 51" [...] under the Dual Contracts, would have had connections going north towards St. George and along the North Shore Branch towards Arlington, and south towards Tottenville on the Main Line and Wentworth Avenue along the South Beach Branch. This proposal was estimated to cost $12,000,000 in the year 1912, with half of it to be paid by railroads, such as the Pennsylvania Railroad (which operated the Long Island Rail Road) and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (which operated the SIRT). A {{major part of the}} 1912 proposal was the inclusion of two 40 inch water mains, which were to be side by side and were to be installed by the Department of Water <b>Supply,</b> <b>Gas</b> and Electricity alongside the tubes.

2500|$|A {{gas panel}} or gas {{manifold}} is the control equipment for supplying the breathing gas to the divers. Primary and reserve gas is supplied {{to the panel}} through shutoff valves from a low-pressure compressor or high-pressure storage cylinders ("bombs", [...] "quads", or [...] "kellys"). The gas pressure may be controlled at the panel by an industrial pressure regulator, or it may already be regulated closer to the source (at the compressor, or at the storage cylinder outlet). The <b>supply</b> <b>gas</b> pressure is monitored on a gauge at the panel, and an over-pressure valve is fitted in case the supply pressure is too high. The gas panel may be operated by the diving supervisor if the breathing gas is air or a fixed ratio premix, but if the composition must be controlled or monitored during the dive it is usual for a dedicated gas panel operator, or [...] "gas man" [...] to do this work.|$|E
2500|$|The {{lack of a}} State Government {{contingency}} plan was criticised by Robert Amin, Curtin University's chair of Petroleum Engineering {{and chair of the}} Woodside Research Foundation, who said the Government should have stored enough gas in underground reservoirs to power the state for at least one month, to mitigate a potential crisis. Amin said gas could be stored in parts of the Perth Basin depleted of gas, like Dongara, and companies could be offered tax incentives. Federal Opposition spokesperson for trade, Ian Macfarlane, called for a national audit of all gas pipelines, and highlighted the vulnerability of the single pipeline that carries WA's gas from the North West Shelf. Macfarlane said, [...] "At the very least this event comes as a wake-up call {{for the construction of a}} second pipeline from the North West shelf to <b>supply</b> <b>gas</b> to industry especially in the south-western part of Western Australia." [...] Professor Dong-ke Zhang, Director of the Centre for Petroleum, Fuels and Energy at the University of Western Australia, said, [...] "I would have thought it was quite silly for a very advanced state like WA that we are not able to cope with an incident like this by not having the ability to divert gas from an LNG plant to the domestic pipeline. At a policy level, the infrastructure needs to be longer term and the Government should encourage major players like Woodside and Chevron to invest in the infrastructure and give the incentives for the industry to come to the party because they get much bigger margins by selling LNG overseas." ...|$|E
2500|$|Considered {{its worst}} in decades, Egypt's energy crisis that helped inflame the protests against former {{president}} Mohamed Morsi {{continued to grow}} in Sisi's first months in office, challenging the new government. Due to shortage in energy production, growing consumption, terrorist attacks on Egypt's energy infrastructure, debts to foreign oil companies {{and the absence of}} the needed periodic maintenance of the power plants, the energy blackouts rates in Egypt rose to unprecedented levels, with {{some parts of the country}} facing around six power cuts a day for up to two hours each. In August 2014, daily electricity consumption hit a record high of 27.7 gigawatts, 20% more power than stations could provide. The next month Egypt suffered a massive power outage that halted parts of the Cairo Metro, took television stations off the air, and ground much of the country to a halt for several hours because of the sudden loss of 50 percent of the country's power generation. Sisi, on his part, said that the idler would be held accountable and promised to partially solve the economic crisis by August 2015, and that, beginning with December that year, the crisis will be dealt with entirely. Both long-term and short-term plans were introduced. In the short-term, Egypt signed a contract with General Electric (GE) to provide the country with 2.6 gigawatts by the summer of 2015. The first phase entered service in June and the final phase was expected to be completed by the end of August, making it one of the fastest energy transferring operations in the world according to GE. In June, Sisi's administration stated that for the first time in years, Egypt achieved a surplus in power generating capacity estimated at 2.9 gigawatts. In the long-term, Egypt paid more than $6 billion it owed to foreign oil companies between January and March. Energy contracts were placed as a top priority in the Egypt Economic Development Conference in March 2015, resulting in a $9billion contract with Siemens to <b>supply</b> <b>gas</b> and wind power plants to boost the country's electricity generation by 50 percent, in addition to an energy deal worth $12billion (LE91.5billion) with BP to provide the country with an extra quarter of local energy production.
