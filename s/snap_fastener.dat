50|$|Flat lead shanks {{and thin}} {{diameter}} ropes generally lack {{the strength to}} securely tie a large animal such as a horse or cow, but may be more comfortable in a person's hand for leading. Ropes of a thick diameter (3/4 in or more) and high tensile strength generally are adequate to tie a large animal that resists being tied; thinner and/or weaker leads generally will break if significant tension is put on them. A common point of failure is the <b>snap</b> <b>fastener</b> used to attach the lead to the halter.|$|E
50|$|A <b>snap</b> <b>fastener</b> (also called press stud, popper, snap or tich) {{is a pair}} of {{interlocking}} discs, {{made out}} of a metal or plastic, commonly used in place of buttons to fasten clothing and for similar purposes. A circular lip under one disc fits into a groove {{on the top of the}} other, holding them fast until a certain amount of force is applied. Different types of snaps can be attached to fabric or leather by riveting with a punch and die set specific to the type of rivet snaps used (striking the punch with a hammer to splay the tail), sewing, or plying with special snap pliers.|$|E

5000|$|Modern <b>snap</b> <b>fasteners</b> {{were first}} {{patented}} by German inventor Heribert Bauer in 1885 as the [...] "Federknopf-Verschluss", a novelty fastener for men's trousers.

Australian inventor Myra Juliet Farrell is also credited with inventing a 'stitchless press stud' and the 'stitchless hook and eye.' In America, Jack Weil (1901-2008) put snaps on his iconic Western shirts, which spread the fashion for them. The Prym-company produces <b>snap</b> <b>fasteners</b> since 1903.|$|R
50|$|In {{the modern}} world, bags are ubiquitous, with many people {{routinely}} carrying {{a wide variety}} of them in the form of cloth or leather briefcases, handbags, and backpacks, and with bags made from more disposable materials such as paper or plastic being used for shopping, and to carry home groceries. A bag may be closable by a zipper, <b>snap</b> <b>fastener,</b> etc., or simply by folding (e.g. {{in the case of a}} paper bag). Sometimes a money bag or travel bag has a lock. The bag likely predates the inflexible variant, the basket, and bags usually have the additional advantage over baskets of being foldable or otherwise compressible to smaller sizes. On the other hand, baskets, being made of a more rigid material, may better protect their contents.|$|E

40|$|A <b>snap</b> <b>fastener</b> is a {{deformable}} device {{consisting of}} a pair of mating surfaces that "snap" together during assembly. Because of the simple, linear assembly motion, such latching micro fasteners have a wide range of applications in micro assembly tasks, e. g. for devices with multiple or layered components, or micro opto-mechanical plugs. At the micro scale, conventional types of fasteners like screws and hinges are unlikely to work due to present fabrication constraints and large friction forces. Micro snap fasteners also have great potential to be used as sensors with memory...|$|E

40|$|This article {{addresses}} the design, development, {{and evaluation of}} T-shirt prototypes that embed novel textile sensors for the capture of cardio and respiratory signals. The sensors are connected through textile interconnects to either an embedded custom-designed data acquisition and transmission unit or to <b>snap</b> <b>fastener</b> terminals for connection to external monitoring devices. The performance of the T-shirt prototype is evaluated in terms of signal-to-noise ratio amplitude and signal interference caused by baseline wander and motion artefacts, through laboratory tests with subjects in standing and walking conditions. Performance tests were also conducted in a hospital environment using a T-shirt prototype connected to a commercial three-channel Holter monitoring device. The textile sensors and interconnects were realized {{with the assistance of}} an industrial six-needle digital embroidery tool and their resistance to wear addressed with normalized tests of laundering and abrasion. The performance of these wearable systems is discussed, and pathways and methods for their optimization are highlighted...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of different matrix designs on resilient attachment on an implant-assisted removable partial denture (IARPD) using finite element analysis (FEA). Materials and Methods: A laser scanner was used to extract the geometrical data of a human partially edentulous mandible. A 12 -mm-long and 4. 8 -mm-diameter-wide implant was modeled, and two types of intradental attachment of <b>snap</b> <b>fastener</b> principle (elliptical) and resilient attachment (titanium) matrices were modeled along with tooth roots and periodontal ligaments. The modeling was performed with a combination of reverse engineering and solid modeling. The model incorporated a removable partial denture and was loaded with realistic bilateral forces. The FEA was used to analyze the stress and strain distributions in the IARPD and in the metal framework. Results: Stresses and deformations in the metal framework and resin denture base surfaces were analyzed for the elliptical and titanium matrix designs. The maximum von Mises stresses were 605. 85 and 614. 96 MPa in the metal framework surface and 10. 35 and 10. 63 MPa in the resin denture base surface, respectively, for the elliptical and titanium matrix designs. The maximum deformations (displacements) were 418. 5 and 428. 3 Î¼m in the metal framework surface for the elliptical and titanium matrix designs, respectively. The corresponding values of displacements for the resin denture base surface were 325. 52 and 249. 22 Î¼m for the elliptical and titanium matrix designs, respectively. The maximum displacements in the matrixes were, however, nearly the same (229. 51 and 229. 47 Î¼m) for both the elliptical and titanium matrixes. Conclusion: The titanium matrix design was a more favorable design compared with the elliptical design, because it had lower lateral deformation as indicated by the maximum displacement...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} of Mn(III) superoxide dismutase (Mn(III) SOD) from Thermus thermophilus, a tetramer of chains 203 residues in length, has been refined by restrained least-squares methods. The R-factor (= [summation operator]||Fo|-|Fc||/[summation operator]|Fo|) for the 54, 056 unique reflections measured between 10 [middle dot] 0 and 1 [middle dot] 8 A (96 % {{of all possible}} reflections) is 0 [middle dot] 176 for a model comprising the protein dimer and 180 bound solvents, the asymmetric unit of the P 41212 cell. The monomer chain forms two domains as determined by distance plots: the N-terminal domain is dominated by two long antiparallel helices (residues 21 to 45 and 69 to 89) and the C-terminal domain (residues 100 to 203) is an [alpha] + [beta] structure including a three-stranded sheet. Features that may be important for the folding and function of this MnSOD include: (1) a cis-proline in a turn preceding the first long helix; (2) a residue inserted at position 30 that distorts the helix near the first Mn ligand; and (3) the locations of glycine and proline residues in the domain connector (residues 92 to 99) and {{in the vicinity of}} the short cross connection (residues 150 to 159) that links two strands of the [beta]-sheet. Domain-domain contacts include salt bridges between arginine residues and acidic side chains, an extensive hydrophobic interface, and at least ten hydrogen-bonded interactions. The tetramer possesses 222 symmetry but is held together by only two types of interfaces. The dimer interface at the non-crystallographic dyad is extensive (1000 A 2 buried surface/ monomer) and incorporates 17 trapped or structural solvents. The dimer interface at the crystallographic dyad buries fewer residues (750 A 2 /monomer) and resembles a <b>snap</b> <b>fastener</b> in which a type I turn thrusts into a hydrophobic basket formed by a ring of helices in the opposing chain. Each of the metal sites is fully occupied, with the Mn(III) five-co-ordinate in trigonal bipyramidal geometry. One of the axial ligands is solvent; the four protein ligands are His 28, His 83, Asp 166 and His 170. Surrounding the metal-ligand cluster is a shell of predominantly hydrophobic residues from both chains of the asymmetric unit (Phe 86 A, Trp 87 A, Trp 132 A, Trp 168 A, Tyr 183 A, Tyr 172 B, Tyr 173 B), and both chains collaborate in the formation of a solvent-lined channel that terminates at Tyr 36 and His 32 near the metal ion and is presumed to be the path by which substrate or other inner-sphere ligands reach the metal. A pocket adjoining the metal, formed by His 33, Trp 87, His 83 and Tyr 36, is postulated to be the substrate-binding site. Refinement of 2. 3 A data from crystals reduced with dithionite indicates that the co-ordination geometry at the metal is not changed by reduction...|$|E
