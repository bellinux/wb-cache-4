30|$|One of {{the most}} crucial {{parameters}} for determining the velocity of a landslide is the friction coefficient calculated according to the contact area that lies between the <b>sliding</b> <b>material</b> and the underlying layer. Less friction between the <b>sliding</b> <b>material</b> and the underlying layer engenders higher speeds. The friction coefficient typically depends on the materials, the textures of the surfaces, and given lubricants. Like the friction coefficient in the fault planes, the friction coefficient of rocks beneath landslides is a vital subject {{in the study of}} geodynamic processes (Sibson 1982; Scholz 1990; 1988). Determining whether an earthquake occurring along a fault plane exhibits high or low friction, it is interesting to know the seismogenic mechanism (Zoback et al. 1987). To determine friction coefficients along fault planes, the friction coefficients of various rock types have been measured in laboratories under simplified physical conditions (Dieterich 1978; Dieterich and Kilgore 1994; Blanpied et al. 1991). However, direct measurement of friction coefficients in the field remains difficult.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Seismic {{performance}} of a symmetrical space frame structure resting on sliding bearing with restoring force device is studied considering all the six degrees of freedom. The sliding support is modeled as a fictitious spring with two horizontal degrees of freedom. In non-sliding phase the horizontal stiffness of sliding bearing is considered as very large whereas it is equal to zero during sliding phase. The El Centro, Turkey and Mexico earthquakes are adopted as the input motion. The response quantities obtained from the analysis are the acceleration, base shear, bending moment and displacement. In this study, {{the response of the}} isolated structure is compared with the response of the structure fixed at the base. Response of the isolation system with restoring force device is also compared with the response of the isolation system without restoring force device. In addition, the effects of coefficient of friction of <b>sliding</b> <b>material,</b> time period of the superstructure and the number of storeys on response of structure are also investigated. It is concluded from the study that the sliding bearing with restoring force device reduces the earthquake response of the structure. The restoring force device reduces the sliding and residual displacements without transmitting additional forces into the structure. Response of the isolated structure varies with the coefficient of friction of <b>sliding</b> <b>material,</b> time period of superstructure and number of storeys. Also, there exists an optimum coefficient of friction of <b>sliding</b> <b>material</b> for acceleration, base shear and bending moment at which accelera-tion, base shear and bending moment attains a minimum value...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Ionic {{liquid is}} {{expected}} {{to function as a}} novel lubricant under vacuum conditions because of its unique properties, such as low volatility, thermal stability, and electrical polarity. The tribological behaviour of an ionic liquid that would be used for four kinds of metals, Al, Cu, Fe, andTi, was evaluated using a high-vacuumpin-on-disc sliding tester equippedwith aQ-mass spectrometer. The ionic liquid exhibited the expected lubricity for Fe and Cu. Increases of several partial gas pressures, which are thought to be caused by the tribo-chemical decomposition of the ionic liquid, were observed in all cases. Deterioration of the vacuum level was seen for Ti and Al. Surface analytical results using X-ray photoelectron spectrometer showed the formation of metal fluoride on the sliding metal surfaces except for Cu. The tribo-chemical reaction and decomposition behaviour of the ionic liquid strongly depended on the kind of sliding metal.

30|$|A {{velocity}} {{as high as}} that of the Hsiaolin landslide (approximately 298 km/h) had {{not been}} reported anywhere in the world prior to 2009. A high-velocity landslide of that scale is difficult to observe unless it can be predicted. The factors contributing to such a landslide includes a low friction coefficient, long run-out distance, and gentle dip-slope ground surface. The friction coefficient of the Hsiaolin landslide (approximately 0.12) is lower than that of most comparable landslides and debris flows (Scheidegger 1973; Brodsky et al. 2003). This low friction coefficient was can be attributed mainly to extremely heavy rainfall, which infiltrated the space between the <b>sliding</b> <b>material</b> and the overlying ground. In addition, the long run-out distance of approximately 2, 500 m resulted from a gentle dip-slope surface extending from Hsindoshan to Chishan Creek. The dip slope has an average incline of approximately 15 °, and the inclination varies from 10 ° to 20 °. Consequently, the major portion of the collapsed landslide moved downhill smoothly until it reached the Chishan creek.|$|E
