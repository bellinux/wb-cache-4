2500|$|There is a {{critical}} lack of scientific research {{that has been done}} on Naultinus species and this fact, combined with the behaviourally and visually cryptic nature of the genus pose major challenges to their conservation management. For many Naultinus species, (examples include grayii,stellatus and rudis) there is a complete lack of accurate data in key areas such as distribution, abundance and recruitment rate (primarily because they are visually and behaviourally cryptic)- these types of information are critical to developing conservation management plans and make the conservation status of these species very difficult to determine; Some species have not had a single scientific <b>study</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> them, simply because they are so hard to find. The behaviourally cryptic aspect relates to the previously described behaviour whereby Naultinus will descend to ground level to hide in vegetation and shelter from cold and poor weather conditions; whole populations will appear to vanish and no amount of searching will turn them up, only for them to [...] "reappear" [...] when the weather improves. These [...] "disappearing acts" [...] have meant that the local extinction of many Naultinus populations has been overlooked because they were temporarily dismissed as simply being hard to find while sheltering from bad weather.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2011 census roughly 54 {{per cent}} of the {{population}} identified with a form of Christianity and 36.7 per cent stated they had no religion; 5.5 per cent did not state a religion. In 2001, there [...] were a significantly lower 27.5 per cent who stated {{that they had no}} religion (which compares with 15.5 per cent in the UK overall). A <b>study</b> <b>carried</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> behalf of the British Humanist Association {{at the same time as}} the 2011 census suggested that those not identifying with a denomination, or who see themselves as non-religious, may be much higher at between 42 and 56 per cent, depending on the form of the question asked. In 2016 the Scottish Social Attitudes survey found that 52 per cent of people said they are not religious, compared with 40 per cent in 1999 when the survey began. While Roman Catholic (15 per cent) and other Christian (11 per cent) affiliations have remained steady, the decline is most rapid in the Church of Scotland, from 35 per cent in 1999 to 20 per cent. In 2017, the Humanist Society Scotland commissioned a survey of Scottish residents 16 years and older, asking the question “Are you religious,” of the 1,016 respondents 72.4 percent responded no, 23.6 said yes, and 4 percent did not answer.Church attendance has also declined, with two-thirds of people living in Scotland saying they [...] "never or practically never" [...] attend services, compared with 49 per cent when the survey began. Scotland has therefore been described as the fastest secularising nation in history.|$|E
