5|$|Joust 2: <b>Survival</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fittest</b> is an arcade game {{developed}} by Williams Electronics and released in 1986. It is {{a sequel to}} Williams' 1982 game Joust. Like its predecessor, Joust 2 is a 2D aerial combat game with platforms to land on. The player uses a button and joystick to control a knight riding a flying ostrich. The object is to progress through levels by defeating groups of enemy knights riding buzzards. Joust 2 features improved audio-visuals and new features such as mutant buzzards created by eggs falling into lava, the ability to transform from an ostrich to a flying horse, and differently themed levels. Waves no longer seamlessly flow into each other; the gameplay is divided into separate screens with transitions between them.|$|E
5|$|The one Germanic-language {{speaking}} {{country that}} {{was not included in}} the Pan-Germanic unification aim was the United Kingdom, in spite of its near-universal acceptance by the Nazi government as being part of the Germanic world. Leading Nordic ideologist Hans F. K. Günther theorized that the Anglo-Saxons had been more successful than the Germans in maintaining racial purity and that the coastal and island areas of Scotland, Ireland, Cornwall and Wales had received additional Nordic blood through Norse raids and colonization during the Viking Age, and the Anglo-Saxons of East Anglia and Northern England had been under Danish rule in the 9th and 10th centuries. Günther referred to this historical process as Aufnordung ("additional nordification"), which finally culminated in the Norman conquest of England in 1066. Britain was thus a nation created by struggle and the <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fittest</b> among the various Aryan peoples of the isles, and was able to pursue global conquest and empire-building because of its superior racial heredity born through this development.|$|E

In particular, we explore {{whether and how}} effectively markets reward newlyborn firms according to their ‘fitness’ {{in terms of both}} labour productivity and profitability.

Third, we explore how new firms’ relative fitness affects their growth performance in different sectors.

30|$|Inspired {{in natural}} {{evolution}} ideas, Pareto optimization evolves {{a population of}} candidate solutions (i.e., weights), adapting them to multiobjective evaluator functions (i.e., FIDM). This process takes advantage of evolution mechanisms such as <b>the</b> <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fit</b> test and genetic material recombination. <b>The</b> <b>fit</b> test is an evaluation process, which finds the weights that maximize the multiobjective evaluator functions. The Pareto algorithm starts with an initial population. Each individual is a weight vector containing weights to be adjusted. Then, the population is evaluated by the multiobjective evaluator functions (i.e., FIDM). A number of best weight sets are selected {{to build a new}} population with {{the same size as the}} previous one. <b>The</b> individuals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new population are recombined in two steps, that is, crossover and mutation. The first step recombines <b>the</b> weight values <b>of</b> two individuals to produce two new children. The children replace their parent in the population. The second step introduces random perturbations to the weights with a given probability. Finally, a new population is obtained to replace the original one, starting the evolutionary cycle again. This process stops when a certain finalization criteria is satisfied.|$|R

After {{the publication of}} On the Origin of Species, educated people generally accepted that evolution had occurred in some form.

However, some thinkers enthusiastically embraced natural selection; after reading Darwin, Herbert Spencer introduced the phrase <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fittest,</b> which became a popular summary of the theory. The fifth edition of On the Origin of Species published in 1869 included Spencer's phrase {{as an alternative to}} natural selection, with credit given: [...] "But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer of the <b>Survival</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fittest</b> is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient."

40|$|Abstract Background The {{justification}} for Nazi programs involving involuntary euthanasia, forced sterilisation, eugenics and human experimentation were {{strongly influenced by}} views about human dignity. <b>The</b> historical development <b>of</b> these views should be examined today because discussions of human worth and value are integral to medical ethics and bioethics. We should learn lessons from how human dignity came to be so distorted to avoid repetition of similar distortions. Discussion Social Darwinism was foremost amongst the philosophies impacting views of human dignity in the decades leading up to Nazi power in Germany. Charles Darwin's evolutionary theory was quickly applied to human beings and social structure. <b>The</b> term 'survival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fittest' was coined and seen to be applicable to humans. Belief in <b>the</b> inherent dignity <b>of</b> all humans was rejected by social Darwinists. Influential authors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day proclaimed that an individual's worth and value were to be determined functionally and materialistically. <b>The</b> popularity <b>of</b> such views ideologically prepared German doctors and nurses to accept Nazi social policies promoting <b>survival</b> <b>of</b> only <b>the</b> <b>fittest</b> humans. A historical survey reveals five general presuppositions that strongly impacted medical ethics in the Nazi era. These same five beliefs are being promoted in different ways in contemporary bioethical discourse. Ethical controversies surrounding human embryos revolve around determinations of their moral status. Economic pressures force individuals and societies to examine whether some people's lives are no longer worth living. Human dignity is again being seen as a relative trait found in certain humans, not something inherent. These views strongly impact what is taken to be acceptable within medical ethics. Summary Five beliefs central to social Darwinism will be examined {{in light of their}} influence on current discussions in medical ethics and bioethics. Acceptance <b>of</b> these during <b>the</b> Nazi era proved destructive to many humans. Their widespread acceptance today would similarly lead to much human death and suffering.

The multi-objective problems ascend in the complex real world industries like machining, design, transportation industries etc. It is seen that, all the important real world practical problems involving multiple criteria with several constraints are drawing much attention towards the multi-objective optimization. These problems could be effectively solved with less computational effort and high accuracy. In multi-objective optimization problems, genetic algorithms approach is a better technique compared to other methods and has received considerable attention by the researchers. GA is based on <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> <b>survival</b> for <b>the</b> <b>fittest.</b> In this method, initially a population of strings is selected randomly. These are encoded in binary digits and it is traditionally used to signify the chromosomes using with zeros and ones. Further, the fitness value (maximization or minimization problems) is computed. Further to create a new population, operations like reproduction, crossover and mutation were applied consecutively. Once the new population is generated it is further evaluated and tested for the conformability.|$|R
