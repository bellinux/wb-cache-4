With this reversal, the female {{is able to}} discriminate between males' gentalic sclerite. This {{is an example of}} a copulatory mechanism where the female actively hinders a successful mating.|$|E
50|$|This {{defense is}} usually induced through contact of the {{proteins}} {{of the liquid}} white secretions of the white secretory tubule 1 of a male's accessory glands with the female's <b>spermathecal</b> <b>duct</b> (the process of which forms a spermatophore). More specifically, this {{is caused by a}} pheromone which is spurred by one of these proteins, of size less than 90 kDa. It can also be triggered by eggs exerting pressure against the walls of the oviduct on the pathway to oviposition. It is hypothesized that the secretion stimulates a bristle field of contact chemoreceptors where the <b>spermathecal</b> <b>duct</b> enters the endbulb. In other words, this defensive behavior is caused by both chemical and mechanical means. In terms of the four different stages of female behavior toward males, after copulation the female returns to a defensive state in which she rejects all male advances.|$|E
50|$|There are {{additional}} {{reasons for the}} inability to remate. The spermatophore actually blocks the <b>spermathecal</b> <b>duct</b> so that another spermatophore cannot physiologically be planted. Additionally, after mating is completed, the genitalia of the pair hook firmly together for 40 to 90 minutes due to the clasping reflex, which prevents other males from mating with the female before she reaches the defensive state.|$|E

50|$|The adult Oxycorynini have {{a number}} of fairly {{characteristic}} traits, but they are not present in all members of this tribe. Many have a pronotum whose hind margin is at least as wide as the elytra bases, often wider.

50|$|Traits such as body size, testis size, and sperm length are variable, {{as well as}} {{heritable}} in S. stercoraria males. Larger sperm may be advantageous if {{they have}} greater propulsion along the female's <b>spermathecal</b> <b>duct,</b> resulting in higher fertilization success rates. When competition among males is high and females are mating with multiple males, those with the largest testes also have the most success in terms of proportion of sperm that fertilize a female’s eggs. The resulting male offspring would then have a similar advantage.A positive correlation was found between sperm length of males and <b>spermathecal</b> <b>duct</b> length of females. The size of male testis was also positively correlated with female spermathecae size. Additionally, females with larger spermathecae {{are better able to}} produce spermicidal secretion. This cryptic female choice betters their ability to influence paternity over their offspring. These covariances are an example of an “evolutionary arms race”. This suggests that each sex evolves certain traits to undermine the beneficial traits of the other, resulting in the coevolution of male and female reproductive systems of S. stercoraria.|$|E

50|$|A saccular {{dilation}} in the spermatheca stores spermatozoa {{received from}} males during copulation. It can maximize efficiency {{and use of}} sperm. Derived from the ectoderm, the spermatheca is covered in fat and tissue and has three main regions: the distal region, the medial region and the proximal region. The coiled distal region {{is responsible for the}} control of sperm flow. It can modulate how much sperm is excreted which ensures that the female does not lose an excess of sperm. The proximal region contains valves which prevent the backflow of sperm when muscles dilate. This region is connected to the <b>spermathecal</b> <b>duct</b> where sperm exits. Stacconi and Romani (2011) found that, overall, the saccular structure within the spermatheca {{plays a key role in}} identifying mated and unmated females. Males are able to identify a mated versus unmated female by the volume of the saccular gland. The study also shows that parasitoid insects are able to identify mated and unmated females.|$|E
50|$|Females have a penis-like structure, {{called the}} gynosome {{that has a}} tube leading into their body to where their {{genitalia}} are located. Neotrogla males have a structure resembling that of a vagina. However, {{on the inside of}} their body, they have male genitalia. When the female inserts her organ into the male, the tip of the pseudo penis inflates. When this tip inflates, species specific ridges and spines flare up that match up with the walls of the male’s seminal duct. This serves two functions, to stimulate the male’s reproductive organs, and to keep the male and female locked together. After they have been locked together, {{the only way to get}} the two to part would be to rip off the abdomen of the male. During the lengthy, 40- to 70-hour copulation process, these male genitalia structures ejaculate inside of the male’s body. The sperm is then deposited into the female’s structure and then travels through a <b>spermathecal</b> <b>duct</b> to where it can fertilize the eggs.|$|E
50|$|Muscle {{contraction}} as a {{means of}} moving spermatozoa through the reproductive system {{into and out of the}} storage structures has been examined in Diptera, Orthoptera, and Lepidoptera as well as in the species Rhodnius prolixus and the boll weevil. In R. prolixus, rhythmic peristaltic contractions of the oviduct cause contractions of the bursa copulatrix and spermatheca movement. This movement of the spermatheca results in spermatozoa migration into the <b>spermathecal</b> <b>duct</b> and into the spermatheca reservoir. In the boll weevil, contractions are also used to move sperm from the spermathecae so they can fertilize the egg. It has been observed in locusts, that the nervous system initiates female reproductive muscular contractions. In some species, such as R. prolixus, the contractions that move spermatozoa into sperm storage are initiated by a male secretion in the ejaculate. Male secretions, such as the glycoprotein ACP36D in Drosophila, can also play a role in preparing the female reproductive system for sperm storage. It causes changes in uterine shape allowing spermatozoa access to the sperm storage organs.|$|E
40|$|Female sperm {{storage is}} a key factor for {{reproductive}} success {{in a variety of}} organisms, including Drosophila melanogaster. The spermathecae, one of the Drosophila sperm storage organs, has been suggested as a long-term storage organ because its secreted substances may enhance the quality of sperm storage. Glucose dehydrogenase (GLD) is widely expressed and secreted in the <b>spermathecal</b> <b>ducts</b> among species of the genus Drosophila. This highly conserved expression pattern suggests that this enzyme might have an important role in female fertility. Here, we examine the function of GLD in sperm storage and utilization using Gld-null mutant females. The absence of GLD reduced the amount of sperm stored in the spermathecae and led to a highly asymmetrical sperm distribution in the two spermathecal capsules of the mutant females. The storage defect was especially severe when the mutant females were crossed to a Gld-mutant male that had previously mated a few hours before the experimental cross. Under this mating condition, the mutant females stored in the spermathecae only one-third of the sperm amount of the wild-type control females. In addition, the mutant females used stored sperm at a slower rate over a longer period compared with wild-type females. Thus, our results indicate that GLD facilitates both sperm uptake and release through the <b>spermathecal</b> <b>ducts...</b>|$|R
40|$|The lumbriculid Rhynchelmis {{subgenus}} Sutroa Eisen, 1888 new rank {{is defined}} {{for a group}} of Nearctic species having multiple diverticula originating at the <b>spermathecal</b> <b>ducts</b> and eversible penial bulbs. Characters are confirmed in speci-mens of the type species, Rhynchelmis (Sutroa) rostrata (Eisen, 1888), collected from the type locality. Rhynchelmis (Sutroa) klamathensis Fend n. sp. is described from open water benthic habitats in Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon, USA. It resembles other R.

50|$|The {{following}} {{describes the}} reproductive system of Arion ater—a hermaphrodite capable of self-fertilization. The ovotestis (gonad or hermaphrodite gland) produces gametes at the proximal {{end of the}} reproductive system. The hermaphrodite duct runs forward, connecting to the albumen gland and the common duct (spermoviduct). The male and female gametes separate before entering the common duct. The male portion of the reproductive tract contains the vas deferens and the epiphallus. Arion slugs lack a penis. The vas deferens connects the spermoviduct to the epiphallus. The epiphallus then opens to the genital atrium. The <b>spermathecal</b> <b>duct</b> (bursa copulatrix duct) is a sac for storing spermatozoa and also enters the atrium. The female portion contains the oviduct, transferring eggs from the common duct to the atrium. The atrium is further subdivided into an upper and lower atrium. A stimulating organ (ligula) {{can also be found}} in the atrium. Finally, the atrium opens through the genital pore. The genital pore is located on the animal slightly behind and below the right upper tentacle on the head.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to acoustic signals, crickets use chemical signals encoded in cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC). CHCs are waxy chemical compounds {{that are found}} on the exoskeleton of most terrestrial arthropods that protect against desiccation, and these compounds {{have been found to}} be sexually dimorphic in Teleogryllus oceanicus. [...] It is thought that crickets use the information found in the CHC chemical signal to determine genetic similarity. In other words, crickets can sense how closely related an adjacent individual is by processing the odor exhibited by the CHCs. Females have been shown to exhibit a preference for CHC profiles that show a higher degree of dissimilarity, suggesting that it could serve as a defense against inbreeding. [...] Using CHC profiles in inbreeding defense can occur pre-copulation, in that individuals are less likely to mate when their CHC profile is more similar. [...] This defense can also be exhibited post-copulation, in the form of fertilization bias. After a spermatophore has been transferred to the female's reproductive tract, it takes roughly 40 minutes for the sperm to enter the <b>spermathecal</b> <b>duct,</b> during which time the male remains in contact with the female in a guarding behavior. During this period, females are able to use CHC cues to determine degree of relatedness. Females have control of sperm storage to a degree, and have been show to store more sperm from non-related males compared to related males.|$|E
