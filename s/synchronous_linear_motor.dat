Then, an integral backstepping approach is proposed to control the motion of PMSLM drive system. With proposed integral backstepping control system, the mover position of the PMSLM drive possesses the advantages of good transient control performance and robustness to uncertainties for the tracking of periodic reference trajectories. Moreover, to further increase the robustness of the PMSLM drive, an adaptive RNN uncertainty observer is proposed to estimate the required lumped uncertainty.

30|$|Accurate {{positioning}} {{and speed}} {{measurement of the}} high-speed train is critical for the proposed REM-based cognitive Doppler spread compensation algorithms, as accurate location information is the prerequisite to look up the dedicated REM for HSR and obtain the situation awareness. Odometer is {{the most widely used}} in train positioning system because of its low cost and simple-to-implement properties. However, the performance of train odometer-based positioning would easily be influenced by the accumulated counting error due to idling or skidding and the wheel diameter attrition. Integrated train positioning algorithms are developed to leverage both GPS and odometer [30]. Furthermore, the position and speed of the high-speed train can also be periodically calibrated with the balise, which is an electronic beacon or transponder placed between the rails of a railway as part of an automatic train protection system. State-of-the-art train speed and position measurement method such as multi-sensor information fusion in CBTC systems enables very high location accuracy (on the order of 10 – 2 m) [31]; for the high-speed maglev train driven by the long-stator <b>synchronous</b> <b>linear</b> <b>motor,</b> even higher location accuracy (with the positioning resolution of 4.3 mm) has been achieved in the lab measurement by using another method based on measuring cog-slots of the long-stator [32].
