40|$|U. S. Army {{helicopter}} maintenance {{condition is}} affected by operation environment and high flight hours. Due to the environmental conditions and high operation tempo of Afghanistan and Iraq, U. S. Army Aviation created the RESET aviation maintenance program to provide restorative maintenance following deployments in theater. The RESET maintenance program was created {{in addition to the}} existing two-level maintenance programs. Following deployment, RESET is a thorough cleaning to remove contaminants, inspection of airframe and components, and repair cycle to restore the condition of the helicopter to acceptable condition. Based on the original intent of RESET, it was projected that at the conclusion of military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, the RESET maintenance program could be discontinued. Because of the presumed safety, reliability, and mission readiness created by RESET, this thesis appraised the RESET maintenance program as a permanent addition to U. S. Army Aviation maintenance programs. The hypothesis was that RESET does improve safety, reliability, and mission readiness of the Army UH- 60 Black Hawk fleet. The design was a quantitative survey of three variables: safety, reliability, and mission readiness. The survey featured Likert scale and open-ended questions of three groups: UH- 60 maintenance test pilots, UH- 60 AVUM/AVIM maintenance supervisory personnel, and ACE (Airframe Condition Evaluation) technical evaluators. Data from each of the three survey groups verified the hypothesis that RESET improved safety, reliability, and mission readiness. Data from open-ended questions indicated that the additional disassembly and <b>special</b> <b>inspections</b> of RESET are more extensive than the aviation unit and intermediate Phased Maintenance Inspection (PMI). Therefore, given the disassembly and <b>special</b> <b>inspections</b> of RESET, and the verification that RESET improves safety, reliability, and mission readiness, it was concluded that RESET is a successful program that should be continued. Based on the effectiveness of RESET in discovering these deficiencies, RESET should be a permanent addition to the Army aviation maintenance programs...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{situations}} in nonproliferation and international safeguards when {{one needs to}} verify spent research-reactor fuel. <b>Special</b> <b>inspections,</b> a reactor coming under safeguards for the first time, and failed surveillance are prime examples. Several years ago, Los Alamos developed the FORK detector for the IAEA and EURATOM. This detector, together with the GRAND electronics package, is used routinely by inspectors to verify light-water-reactor spent fuels. Both the FORK detector and the GRAND electronics technologies have been transferred and are now commercially available. Recent incidents in the world indicate that research-reactor fuel is potentially a greater concern for proliferation than light-water-reactor fuels. A device similar to the FORK/GRAND should be developed to verify research-reactor spent fuels because the signals from light-water-reactor spent fuel are quite different than those from research-reactor fuels...|$|E
40|$|Non-destructive tests (NDT) are an {{essential}} tool used in <b>special</b> <b>inspections</b> to gather {{detailed information about}} the condition of a bridge. The inspection of bridge decks is a critical task, and, currently, can be successfully carried out using a wide range of NDT techniques. Nevertheless, some of these techniques are excessively expensive and time consuming. One of these techniques, the ground penetrating radar (GPR), has been used for some decades in the non-destructive inspection and diagnosis of concrete bridges. GPR is useful to find general information about the true position of reinforcement and tendon ducts, and check the quality of the construction and materials. A significant number of reinforced and prestressed concrete bridges are deteriorating at a rapid rate and need to be repaired and strengthened. During these rehabilitation processes, designers are often faced with a lack of original design plans and unawareness of the real position of reinforcement and tendon ducts. In this paper, three case studies of the use of GPR techniques for the inspection of concrete bridges are presented and analysed. The main aim of this research is to show the strong need and usefulness of these techniques, which can provide non-visible information about structural geometry and integrity required for strengthening and rehabilitation purposes...|$|E

50|$|CoMET {{services}} {{applied to}} evaluate constructor’s attainment of specified conditions {{take the form}} of quality-assurance (QA) or quality-control (QC) services. QA services are performed directly or indirectly for the owner. The owner specifies {{the nature and extent of}} QA services that the owner believes is appropriate. Some owners specify none at all or only those that may be required by law. Those required by law are imposed via a jurisdiction’s building code. Almost all U.S. jurisdictions base their building codes on “model codes” developed by associations of building officials. The International Code Council (ICC) is the most prominent of these groups and its International Building Code (IBC) is the most commonly used model. As a result, many jurisdictions now require IBC “Special Inspection,” a term defined by the IBC as “the required examination of the materials, installation, fabrication, erection, or placement of components and connections requiring special expertise to ensure compliance with approved construction documents and referenced standards.” <b>Special</b> <b>Inspection</b> requirements vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction based on the provisions adopted by the local building official. While some of the services involved may be similar to or the same as conventional CoMET services, <b>Special</b> <b>Inspection</b> is handled differently. Most commonly, the owner or the owner’s agent is required to retain a building-official-approved Special Inspection-services provider. <b>Special</b> <b>Inspection</b> is often required to obtain a certificate of occupancy.|$|R
40|$|An {{advanced}} method for maintenance cost reduction and structural safety improvement of helicopters frame is presented. In this approach, residual life evaluation {{is based on}} the real time acquisition of the crack damage, by means of dedicated sensor network, and a focused FE model of the fuselage. Recently, the European Defence Agency has proposed a Joint Investment Programme on Innovative Concepts and Emerging Technologies (JIP-ICET). Following this call, the HECTOR proposal was submitted for evaluation; the purpose of this proposal concerns the application of methods for identification, monitoring and prognosis of potential damages (like cracks) in the fuselage of a helicopter. The key issues of this activity will be related with structural assessment, real time acquisition and advanced data fusion process. In particular advanced models for the stress assessment, will be used for the identification of the most critical area for crack nucleation and growth; these area will be monitored with a on board network of last generation sensors (Comparative Vacuum Monitoring, Optical Fibre Sensors, Crack Propagation Gauges, etc). Moreover the final research aim is to obtain a reliable method to assess the damage accumulated in the fuselage by means of on-line advanced prognostic models that allow the real time definition of schedule for periodic and <b>special</b> <b>inspections.</b> In this paper, a review of the state-of-the-art concerning the Structural Health Monitoring applied on helicopter fuselages is described.

This paper analyzes a <b>special</b> <b>inspection</b> process that allows up to two times of consecutive testing for each product to decrease type I inspection errors. This study uses a Markov chain to model {{the steps of the}} inspection process and a product unit’s quality states during inspection. Historical inspection results from a company are used as the data for the Markov chain model. Using the Markov chain model and data, this study analyzes the effect of this <b>special</b> <b>inspection</b> rule on the proportion of the final quality levels and scrap rate. The results demonstrate that this inspection process of possible double testing could help reduce unnecessary rejects and consequently decrease material and production costs...|$|R
