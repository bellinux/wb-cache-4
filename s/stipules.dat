5|$|The unusual {{characteristics}} that set it {{apart from other}} species in the genus include the woody rhizome, undivided styles, and the operculate pollen. Droseraregia shares other features with the robust Tasmanian form of D.arcturi, including the lack of <b>stipules</b> and petioles and the non-circinate growth of the scape.|$|E
5|$|Leaves : Simple, entire (smooth and even), linear, oval to {{filiform}} (thread-like), {{mostly with}} parallel veins, but occasionally net-veined. They are alternate (single and alternating direction) and spiral, {{but may be}} whorled (three or more attached at one node, e.g. Lilium, Fritillaria), cauline (arranged along the aerial stem) or sheathed in a basal rosette. They are rarely petiolate (stem attached before apex), and lack <b>stipules.</b> The aerial stem is unbranched.|$|E
5|$|Gilbertian mimicry {{occurs in}} the genus Passiflora. The leaves of this plant contain toxins that deter herbivorous animals. However, some Heliconius {{butterfly}} larvae have evolved enzymes that break down these toxins, allowing them to specialize on this genus. This has created further selection pressure on the host plants, which have evolved <b>stipules</b> that mimic mature Heliconius eggs near the point of hatching. These butterflies tend to avoid laying eggs near existing ones, which helps avoid exploitative intraspecific competition between caterpillars — those that lay on vacant leaves provide their offspring with a greater chance of survival. Most Heliconius larvae are cannibalistic, meaning that on leaves older eggs hatch first and eat the new arrivals. Thus, it seems that such plants have evolved egg dummies under selection pressure from these grazing herbivore enemies. In addition, the decoy eggs are also nectaries, attracting predators of the caterpillars such as ants and wasps as a further defence.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>stipule</b> can be {{fused to}} the stem, {{or to the}} other <b>stipule</b> from the same node.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>stipule</b> is [...] "interpetiolar" [...] if it {{is located}} in between the petioles, {{as opposed to being}} {{attached}} to the petioles, and generally one <b>stipule</b> from each leaf is fused together, so it appears that there's just one <b>stipule</b> between each leaf.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>stipule</b> is [...] "ochreate" [...] if {{a single}} <b>stipule</b> {{appears to be}} a solid tube that goes {{all the way around the}} stem.|$|R
25|$|The two similar {{species can}} be {{distinguished}} by their <b>stipules.</b> In G. stipulata, the <b>stipules</b> {{at the base of}} the leaves, which are round and deeply toothed, persist throughout the life of the plant. In G. trifoliata the long slender <b>stipules</b> are quickly deciduous, this species also tends to have longer leaves and petals.|$|E
25|$|P. tarminiana is {{distinguished}} from P. tripartita var. mollissima {{by a number}} of features. P. tarminiana has small deciduous <b>stipules</b> while P. tripartita var. mollissima has larger, persistent <b>stipules.</b> The sepals and petals in P. tarminiana are perpendicular to the floral tube or are reflexed, whereas they are never so open in P. tripartita var. mollissima. They are also both much shorter in relation to the length of the floral tube in P. tripartita var. mollissima than in P. tarminiana.|$|E
25|$|Winter buds: Dark red, {{covered with}} a bloom, obtuse; scales {{becoming}} conspicuous <b>stipules</b> for the unfolding leaf, and persistent until the leaf is fully grown. Flower-bud enclosed in a two-valved, caducous bract.|$|E
50|$|The main {{difference}} between Stuckenia and Potamogeton {{is that the}} <b>stipule</b> joins the leaf base; when it is pulled the sheath and <b>stipule</b> comes away, similar to a grass sheath and ligule. Stuckenia vaginata is 1-4 metres long and has longer <b>stipule</b> sheaths than e.g. Stuckenia pecinata and Stuckenia filiformis. Similar to them, it has long narrow linear leaves.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1978 A {{light and}} {{electron}} microscope study of Corylus avellana L. vegetative buds infested with the eriophyoid mites, Cecidiophyopsis vermiformis Nal. and Phycoptella avellanae Nal., is reported. Descriptions are given {{of changes in}} infested <b>stipule</b> tissue. The nipple-like proliferations (enations) which arise on the infested <b>stipule</b> surface are covered by a protein-, lipid-rich epidermal layer. The amount of vascular tissue in the <b>stipule</b> increases with infestation. The differences between healthy and infested <b>stipule</b> are discussed {{with respect to the}} effect each has on mite success and on plant loss...|$|R
50|$|The main {{difference}} from other narrow-leaved pondweeds {{is that the}} <b>stipule</b> joins the leaf base, when it is pulled the sheath and <b>stipule</b> comes away, similar to a grass sheath and ligule.|$|R
25|$|Haptanthus hazlettii is a shrub or tree. It has {{opposite}} leaves spaced at 5.5–6.0cm apart, usually {{arranged in}} two ranks (distichous). The leaves are simple with untoothed (entire) margins. There are no <b>stipules.</b> The leaf stalk (petiole) is short, 7–8mm long, the leaf blade (lamina) 10–13.5cm long by 4.1–5.6cm wide. The entire plant is hairless (glabrous).|$|E
25|$|Over {{much of its}} range, {{perfoliate}} pondweed {{is unlikely to be}} confused with any other pondweed species except perhaps P. praelongus. In North America it could be confused with P. richardsonii, but the latter has <b>stipules</b> that disintegrate to persistent fibres even on {{the lower part of the}} stem, whereas those of P. perfoliatus disintegrate entirely.|$|E
25|$|Many {{species have}} leaves with {{structures}} that attract ants that protect the plant from herbivore insects (a form of mutualism). Extrafloral nectaries are common among the Mimosoideae and the Caesalpinioideae, {{and are also}} found in some Faboideae (e.g. Vicia sativa). In some Acacia, the modified hollow <b>stipules</b> are inhabited by ants and are known as domatia.|$|E
50|$|II) Leaves- Simple {{with free}} lateral <b>stipule.</b>|$|R
50|$|These herbs present {{rhizomes}} but not turions; the tubers can {{be absent}} or present. The main difference between Stuckenia and Potamogeton {{is that the}} <b>stipule</b> joins the leaf base, when it is pulled the sheath and <b>stipule</b> comes away, similar to a grass sheath and ligule.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>stipule</b> is [...] "foliaceous" [...] {{if it is}} leaf-like. These are {{generally}} used to photosynthesize.|$|R
25|$|The {{leaves are}} usually {{alternate}} and compound. Most {{often they are}} even- or odd-pinnately compound (e.g. Caragana and Robinia respectively), often trifoliate (e.g. Trifolium, Medicago) and rarely palmately compound (e.g. Lupinus), in the Mimosoideae and the Caesalpinioideae commonly bipinnate (e.g. Acacia, Mimosa). They always have <b>stipules,</b> which can be leaf-like (e.g. Pisum), thorn-like (e.g. Robinia) or be rather inconspicuous. Leaf margins are entire or, occasionally, serrate. Both the leaves and the leaflets often have wrinkled pulvini to permit nastic movements. In some species, leaflets have evolved into tendrils (e.g. Vicia).|$|E
25|$|Passiflora tarminiana {{is a high}} {{climbing}} vine with hairy {{stems and}} petioles. Where the petioles join the stem it has <b>stipules</b> which are 4–7 by 2–3mm and are soon deciduous. The leaves are three-lobed and hairy below but usually hairless above. The flowers are solitary and hang downwards. The base of the flower has pale green bracts enclosing a swollen nectary chamber. The floral tube (hypanthium) is 6–8 × 0.7–1cm and pale green, while the sepals and petals are 3–6cm long, pink and perpendicular to the floral tube, or reflexed. Fruits taper at both ends, are 10–14cm long by 3.5–4.5cm wide and ripen to yellow or light orange. The fruit contain many seeds which are embedded in an edible, orange aril.|$|E
25|$|All coffee {{plants are}} {{classified}} in the large family Rubiaceae. They are evergreen shrubs or trees that may grow 5m (15ft) tall when unpruned. The leaves are dark green and glossy, usually 10–15cm (4–6in) long and 6cm (2.4in) wide, simple, entire, and opposite. Petioles of opposite leaves fuse at base to form interpetiolar <b>stipules,</b> characteristic of Rubiaceae. The flowers are axillary, and clusters of fragrant white flowers bloom simultaneously. Gynoecium consists of inferior ovary, also characteristic of Rubiaceae. The flowers are followed by oval berries of about 1.5cm (0.6in). When immature they are green, and they ripen to yellow, then crimson, before turning black on drying. Each berry usually contains two seeds, but 5–10% of the berries have only one; these are called peaberries. Arabica berries ripen in six to eight months, while robusta take nine to eleven months.|$|E
50|$|If {{a single}} <b>stipule</b> {{goes all the}} way around the stem, it is known as an ochrea.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>stipule</b> is {{considered}} [...] "spiny" [...] {{if they are}} long and pointy. These are generally used to deter animals.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>stipule</b> is {{considered}} [...] "tendrillar" [...] {{if they are}} long thin tendrils, and are generally used by climbing plants.|$|R
25|$|Monoecious, {{sometimes}} dioecious herbs, shrubs, or {{trees to}} 6m tall. Thorns or other armature absent. <b>Stipules</b> present, sometimes leaf-like is some Meineckia. Petioles present or absent, not pulvinate. leaves simple, arrangement alternate, subopposite, {{or in some}} Poranthera, opposite. margins entire. Inflorescences axillary, or rarely, apparently terminal. Flowers solitary to fasciculate. Sepals free, greenish, persistent. Petals present or absent, often partly adnate to the nectary disk, equal to the sepals or shorter, white or greenish, usually larger in staminate than in pistillate flowers. Disk present, extrastaminal; annular or divided into alternisepalous segments or glands. Stamens opposite the sepals, free or fused for up to 9/10 of their length. Anthers latrorse, at least in bud, opening by longitudinal slits, or in Poranthera, by pores. Ovary usually divided into three locules. Two ovules in each locule. Styles free to almost completely fused. Fruit explosively dehiscent. Seeds usually two per locule; sometimes one in Actephila and Meineckia.|$|E
500|$|The {{leaves are}} opposite, large, [...] long and broad, palmate with 5 pointed lobes that are {{coarsely}} toothed or serrated. They have a leathery texture with thick veins protruding on the underside. They are dark green in colour with a paler underside. Some cultivars have purple-tinged or yellowish leaves. The leaf stalk or petiole is [...] long, is often tinged red with no <b>stipules</b> or leaf-like structures at the base.|$|E
500|$|Drosera regia {{plants are}} fairly large herbs that produce {{horizontal}} woody rhizomes and {{a crown of}} large, linear leaves up to [...] long and [...] wide. The leaves possess stalked glands (tentacles) on the upper surface of the lamina along nearly {{the entire length of}} the leaf. The leaves lack petioles and <b>stipules,</b> emerging by circinate vernation (uncurling) and tapering to a filiform point. The tentacles and the leaf itself are capable of responding to prey by bending toward insects trapped in the sticky mucilage produced by the glands. Leaves are even capable of folding over themselves several times. Each leaf can possess thousands of tentacles, which can aid in the retention of larger prey when combined with the leaf wrapping tightly around captured insects. In its native habitat, D.regia has been known to capture large beetles, moths and butterflies. Plants go dormant during the colder season and form a dormant bud, consisting of a tight cluster of short, immature leaves. Plants begin to break dormancy in mid-July with a typical growing season lasting from October to April, though this is variable and plants can continue growing year-round without dormancy. Individual leaves die back but remain attached to the short stem, clothing the bottom portion of the plant in the blackened dead leaves of former years.|$|E
40|$|The {{genetics}} of the <b>stipule</b> spot pigmentation (SSP) in {{faba bean}} (Vicia faba L.) was studied using four inbred lines, of which Disco/ 2 was zero-tannin (zt 2) with colourless <b>stipule</b> spots, ILB 938 / 2 was normal-tannin (ZT 2) with colourless <b>stipule</b> spots, and both Aurora/ 2 and Mélodie/ 2 were ZT 2 with coloured <b>stipule</b> spots. Crosses Mélodie/ 2 × ILB 938 / 2, Mélodie/ 2 × Disco/ 2, ILB 938 / 2 × Aurora/ 2 and ILB 938 / 2 × Disco/ 2 (A, B, C and D, respectively) were prepared, along with reciprocals and backcrosses, and advanced through single-seed descent. All F 1 hybrid plants had pigmented <b>stipule</b> spots, {{and in the}} F 2 generation, the segregation ratio fit 3 coloured: 1 colourless in crosses A, B and C and 9 : 7 in cross D. In the F 3 generation, the ratio fit 5 : 3 in crosses A and C and 25 : 39 in cross D, and in the F 4 generation, 9 : 7 in cross A. SSP {{was linked to the}} zero-tannin characteristics (white flower) only in cross B. The results show that coloured <b>stipule</b> spot is dominant to colourless and that colouration is determined by two unlinked complementary recessive genes. We propose the symbols ssp 2 for the gene associated with zt 2 in Disco/ 2 and ssp 1 for the gene not associated with tannin content in ILB 938 / 2. The novel ssp 1 locus was mapped at F 5 in cross ‘A’ using Medicago truncatula-derived single-nucleotide polymorphism and was on chromosome 1 of faba bean, in a well-conserved region of M. truncatula chromosome 5 containing some candidate Myb and basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor genes...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>stipule</b> is [...] "adnate" [...] if it's fused {{together}} {{on part of}} the petiole length, but the anterior is still free.|$|R
5000|$|There are small, fleshy {{green leaves}} with linear or {{lance-shaped}} blades oppositely arranged along the stem. Each {{is accompanied by}} a small, pointed <b>stipule.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{leaves are}} simple and mostly alternate, {{sometimes}} opposite. They never possess <b>stipules.</b> They are flat or terete, and their shape is extremely variable, with entire or toothed margins. In some species, {{the leaves are}} reduced to minute scales.

2500|$|In {{the garden}} pea, {{it is only}} the {{terminal}} leaflets that are modified to become tendrils. [...] In other plants such as the yellow vetch (Lathyrus aphaca), the whole leaf is modified to become tendrils while the <b>stipules</b> become enlarged and carry out photosynthesis. Still others use the rachis of a compound leaf as a tendril, such as members of the genus Clematis.|$|E
50|$|Ficus triradiata, {{commonly}} known as the red <b>stipule</b> fig is a hemiepiphytic fig that is endemic to the wet tropical rainforests of northeastern Queensland, Australia.|$|R
5000|$|All Potamogeton have a {{delicate}} membranous sheathing scale, the <b>stipule,</b> at the leaf axil. This may be wholly attached, partly attached, or {{free of the}} leaf, {{and it may have}} inrolled margins or appear as a tube. The morphology of the <b>stipule</b> is an important character for species identification. The flowers, which are often overlooked, are greenish-brown and are composed of four rounded segments borne in a spike. The fruits are spheroidal and green to brown, usually 1-3 mm in diameter, with a noticeable 'beak'.|$|R
