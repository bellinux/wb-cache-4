50|$|There is {{evidence}} that prenatal stress can influence HPA regulation. In animal experiments, exposure to prenatal stress {{has been shown to}} cause a hyper-reactive HPA stress response. Rats that have been prenatally stressed have elevated basal levels and abnormal circadian rhythm of corticosterone as adults. Additionally, they require a longer time for their stress hormone levels to return to baseline following exposure to both acute and prolonged stressors. Prenatally <b>stressed</b> <b>animals</b> also show abnormally high blood glucose levels and have fewer glucocorticoid receptors in the hippocampus. In humans, prolonged maternal stress during gestation is associated with mild impairment of intellectual activity and language development in their children, and with behaviour disorders such as attention deficits, schizophrenia, anxiety and depression; self-reported maternal stress is associated with a higher irritability, emotional and attentional problems.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{having a}} high level of {{receptor}} expression, the physiological role of glucocorticoid signaling in the developing hippocampus is not well defined. Animal studies have shown fetal exposure to elevated levels of GCs(either by direct corticosterone mimetic injection or stressing of the mother) has adverse outcomes. In addition to having reduced birth weights, stressed rat pups have a decreased ability to regulate the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. The hippocampus provides negative feedback to this loop and stressed pups have less sensitive glucocorticoid signaling resulting in elevated levels of glucocorticoids basally and an exaggerated response during stress. [...] As adults, these rats can have impaired cognitive function. Understanding the role of glucocorticoid exposure is important; mothers at risk of preterm delivery are commonly given dexamethasone, a GR agonist, to accelerate fetal lung development and reduce morbidity associated with prematurity. [...] These animals studies have found that postnatal care to prenatally <b>stressed</b> <b>animals</b> can reverse the adverse effects of glucocorticoid signaling. [...] More research is needed to understand the role of glucocorticoids in the context of human hippocampal development.|$|E

50|$|Prenatal {{stress is}} shown to have several affects in fetal brain development. In the {{hippocampus}} of adult male rats, prenatal stress has shown to decrease the rate of proliferation and cell death in the hypothalamus-pituitary axis. Prenatal <b>stressed</b> <b>animals</b> have prolonged corticosterone response. Removing the adrenal glands of the mother eliminates {{the effect of the}} pup's corticosterone response. Supplementing the adrenalectamized mother with corticosterone, rescued the hypothalamic-pituitary-axis response to maternal stress for prenatally stressed offspring. Prenatal stress caused high glucocorticoids, which in turn affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-axis negative feedback.A study by García-Cáceres et al. showed that prenatal stress decreases cell turnover and proliferation in the hypothalamus of adult rats, which reduces structural plasticity and reduces the response to stress in adulthood. This study also showed that when prenatally stressed rats were stressed in adulthood the females showed an increase in corticotropin-releasing hormone suggesting it to be an up-regulation in the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis. Males showed no elevation of corticosterone levels. Increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone with no effect of adult stress and a decrease in the corticotropin-releasing hormone mRNA in the hypothalamus showed a down-regulation. The author concludes that this makes prenatally stressed females less reactive to later life stressors than males.|$|E

The critical period of the amygdalar contribution to stress effects on hippocampal functions was determined by applying muscimol either before stress or immediately after stress. Our results indicate that intra-amygdalar muscimol infusions before uncontrollable restraint– tailshock stress effectively blocked stress-induced physiological and behavioral effects. Specifically, hippocampal slices prepared from vehicle-infused <b>stressed</b> <b>animals</b> exhibited markedly impaired LTP, whereas slices obtained from muscimol-infused <b>stressed</b> <b>animals</b> demonstrated robust LTP comparable with that of unstressed animals.

In contrast to prestress muscimol effects, however, immediate poststress infusions of muscimol into the amygdala failed to interfere with stress impairments of LTP and spatial memory.

40|$|Diarrhoea is {{a common}} {{cause of death in}} {{children}} and weaned animals. Recent research has found that serotonin (5 -HT) in the gastrointestinal tract {{plays an important role in}} regulating growth and the maintenance of mucosa, which protect against diarrhoea. To determine the influence of 5 -HT on intestinal epithelium cell renewal under weaned stress diarrhoea, a weaned-stress diarrhoea mouse model was established with senna infusion (15 mL/Kg) via intragastric administration and stress restraint (SR). Mice with an increase in 5 -HT were induced by intraperitoneal injection with citalopram hydrobromide (CH, 10 mg/Kg). The results demonstrated that compared with the control animals, diarrhoea appeared in weaned stress mice and the 5 -HT content in the small intestine was significantly increased (P< 0. 05). Further, the caspase- 3 cells and cells undergoing apoptosis in the small intestine were significantly increased, but the VH (villus height), V/C (villus height /crypt depth), and PCNA-positive rate significantly decreased. Compared with the control animals, CH increased the intestinal 5 -HT content, caspase- 3 cells and cells undergoing apoptosis but decreased the VH and V/C. Compared with both control and weaned <b>stress</b> <b>animals,</b> weaned <b>stress</b> <b>animals</b> that were pre-treated with CH showed higher 5 -HT concentrations, positive caspase- 3 cells and cells undergoing apoptosis but lower VH, V/C and PCNA-positive rate.

Therefore, weaned stress diarrhoea mice were accompanied by a 5 -HT increase in the small intestine and vice versa, and the increase in 5 -HT induced by CH caused diarrhoea. In brief, 5 -HT and diarrhoea slowed the intestinal epithelium cell renewal and injured the abortion function and mucosal barrier by decreasing VH, V/C and proliferation and increasing epithelium cell apoptosis. </p...|$|R
