60|$|XX. Thus {{in the use}} of brick; {{since that}} is known to be {{originally}} moulded, {{there is no reason why}} it should not be moulded into diverse forms. It will never be supposed to have been cut, and therefore, will cause no deception; it will have only the credit it deserves. In flat countries, far from any quarry of <b>stone,</b> <b>cast</b> brick may be legitimately, and most successfully, used in decoration, and that elaborate, and even refined. The brick mouldings of the Palazzo Pepoli at Bologna, and those which run round the market-place of Vercelli, are among the richest in Italy. So also, tile and porcelain work, of which the former is grotesquely, but successfully, employed in the domestic architecture of France, colored tiles being inserted in the diamond spaces between the crossing timbers; and the latter admirably in Tuscany, in external bas-reliefs, by the Robbia family, in which works, while we cannot but sometimes regret the useless and ill-arranged colors, we would by no means blame the employment of a material which, whatever its defects, excels every other in permanence, and, perhaps, requires even greater skill in its management than marble. For it is not the material, but the absence of the human labor, which makes the thing worthless; and a piece of terra cotta, or of plaster of Paris, which has been wrought by human hand, is worth all the stone in Carrara, cut by machinery. It is, indeed, possible, and even usual, for men to sink into machines themselves, so that even hand-work has all the characters of mechanism; of the difference between living and dead hand-work I shall speak presently; all that I ask at present is, what it is always in our power to secure--the confession of what we have done, and what we have given; so that when we use stone at all, since all stone is naturally supposed to be carved by hand, we must not carve it by machinery; neither must we use any artificial <b>stone</b> <b>cast</b> into shape, nor any stucco ornaments of the color of stone, or which might in anywise be mistaken for it, as the stucco mouldings in the cortile of the Palazzo Vecchio at Florence, which cast a shame and suspicion over every part of the building. But for ductile and fusible materials, as clay, iron, and bronze, since these will usually be supposed to have been cast or stamped, it is at our pleasure to employ them as we will; remembering that they become precious, or otherwise, just in proportion to the hand-work upon them, or to the clearness of their reception of the hand-work of their mould.|$|E

The {{aim of the}} present study was to evaluate the efficacy of microwave disinfection on wet and dry dental <b>stone</b> <b>casts</b> contaminated by a resistant microorganism. Material and methods: In this in vitro study, 34 stone half-casts were prepared, contaminated with and divided into two groups. After drying the specimens of one group for 15 minutes using 450 W microwave energy, all the wet and dry specimens were exposed to 900 W microwave energy for 5 minutes. Specimens were then individually transferred to nutrient broth culture medium and after, one milliliter from each tube was cultured in nutrient agar media for 24 hours, and the colonies were counted in CFU/mL. Data were analyzed using multifactorial ANOVA and Bonferroni tests.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of disinfectant procedures on the dimensional stability and surface quality of a tissue conditioner used as a functional impression material. Materials and Methods: A tissue conditioner (Visco-gel) used as a functional impression material was disinfected by immersion in 5. 25 % sodium hypochlorite or 2 % glutaraldehyde solutions for 10 or 20 minutes, respectively. The control group consisted of specimens (n= 10) that were not treated by disinfectants. For testing the dimensional stability, impressions of an aluminum edentulous arch with three reference points were made. After 24 hours of storage in distilled water, the specimens were treated by one of the disinfection procedures. Impressions were poured and, subsequently, 50 <b>stone</b> <b>casts</b> were measured with a Nikon profile projector. For surface roughness evaluation, disks that contained Visco-gel were pressed against glass slides. The disks were then stored in distilled water for 24 hours. After disinfection, 50 disk-shaped dental <b>stone</b> <b>casts</b> were prepared. Surface roughness values were determined using a profilometer. For each test, data were subjected to two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey′s test (α = 0. 05). Results: The results of the dimensional stability test showed that immersion of Visco-gel impressions in 5. 25 % sodium hypochlorite solution or 2 % glutaraldehyde solution did not significantly change the anteroposterior (AP) and cross-arch (CA) distances of the resultant <b>stone</b> <b>casts</b> when compared to the control group (P> 0. 05). The surface quality of dental <b>stone</b> <b>casts</b> formed by Visco-gel did not change significantly when impressions were immersed in the disinfectant solutions for either 10 or 20 minutes, or when stored in distilled water (P> 0. 05).

The amount of heat associated with processing of polymethyl methacrylate has been correlated with the adaptation of the processed denture base to its supporting tissues. Aims: This study conducted to determine the effect of different curing temperatures on the accuracy of fit of a complete maxillary denture and to compare with that of fiber-reinforced acrylic resins. Materials and Methods : An ideal maxillary rubber mould used to make an edentulous <b>cast.</b> Forty-eight <b>stone</b> <b>casts</b> made from the ideal rubber mould. Out of 48 identical <b>stone</b> <b>casts,</b> 44 <b>stone</b> <b>casts</b> with wax adapted processed using simple acrylic resin.

The variable to investigate was the temperature. Therefore, four denture bases processed at each temperature from 60 °C to 80 °C with two-degree increments for a total of 44 samples using simple acrylic resin. Remaining four samples processed at 70 °C using fiber-reinforced acrylic resin. A traveling microscope used to measure the discrepancy between each cast and its denture base. Statistical analysis used: Analyzed with Student′s unpaired t test. Results : Minimum distortion was observed at 70 °C. Maximum distortion was observed for the denture bases processed at 80 °C. Amount of distortion increases as the processing temperature increases which was highly significant. Distortion was significantly high from 60 to 68 °C in the decreasing order.

6000|$|That day the Romans made no attack, {{nor did the}} Jews {{attempt a}} sally. Only some of the lighter of the engines were brought into the Court of Women, whence they hurled their great stones and heavy darts into the Court of Israel beyond.

She could see the soldiers working at the levers and pulleys till the strings of the catapult or the boards of the balista were drawn to their places. Then the darts or the stones were set in the groove prepared to receive it, a cord was pulled and the missile sped upon its way, making an angry humming noise as it clove the air. At first it looked small; then approaching it grew large, to become small again to her following sight as its journey was accomplished. Sometimes, the stones, which did more damage than the darts, fell upon the paving and bounded along it, marking their course by fragments of shattered marble and a cloud of dust. At others, directed by an evil fate, they crashed into groups of Jews, destroying all they touched.

60|$|Their {{style is}} clear, masculine, and smooth, but not florid; for they avoid {{nothing more than}} {{multiplying}} unnecessary words, or using various expressions. I have perused many of their books, especially those in history and morality. Among the rest, I was much diverted with a little old treatise, which always lay in Glumdalclitch’s bed chamber, and belonged to her governess, a grave elderly gentlewoman, who dealt in writings of morality and devotion. The book treats of the weakness of human kind, and is in little esteem, except among the women and the vulgar. However, I was curious to see what an author of that country could say upon such a subject. This writer went through all the usual topics of European moralists, showing “how diminutive, contemptible, and helpless an animal was man in his own nature; how unable to defend himself from inclemencies of the air, or the fury of wild beasts: how much he was excelled by one creature in strength, by another in speed, by a third in foresight, by a fourth in industry.” He added, “that nature was degenerated in these latter declining ages of the world, and could now produce only small abortive births, in comparison of those in ancient times.” He said “it was very reasonable to think, {{not only that the}} species of men were originally much larger, but also that there must have been giants in former ages; which, as it is asserted by history and tradition, so it has been confirmed by huge bones and skulls, casually dug up in several parts of the kingdom, far exceeding the common dwindled race of men in our days.” He argued, “that the very laws of nature absolutely required we should have been made, in the beginning of a size more large and robust; not so liable to destruction from every little accident, of a tile falling from a house, or a <b>stone</b> <b>cast</b> from the hand of a boy, or being drowned in a little brook.” From this way of reasoning, the author drew several moral applications, useful in the conduct of life, but needless here to repeat. For my own part, I could not avoid reflecting how universally this talent was spread, of drawing lectures in morality, or indeed rather matter of discontent and repining, from the quarrels we raise with nature. And I believe, upon a strict inquiry, those quarrels might be shown as ill-grounded among us as they are among that people.|$|E
