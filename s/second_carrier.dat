5|$|Akagi {{was reduced}} to second-class reserve status on 1 December 1931 in {{preparation}} for a short refit in which her arresting gear was replaced and her radio and ventilation systems were overhauled and improved. After completion of the refit, Akagi became a first-class reserve ship in December 1932. On 25 April 1933, she resumed active service and joined the <b>Second</b> <b>Carrier</b> Division and participated in that year's Special Fleet Maneuvers.|$|E

5|$|On 25 May 1942, Akagi set {{out with}} the Combined Fleet's carrier {{striking}} force {{in the company of}} carriers Kaga, , and , which constituted the First and <b>Second</b> <b>Carrier</b> Divisions, for the attack on Midway Island. Once again, Nagumo flew his flag on Akagi. Because of damage and losses suffered during the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Fifth Carrier Division with carriers Shōkaku and Zuikaku was absent from the operation. Akagis aircraft complement consisted of 24 Zeros, 18 D3As, and 18 B5Ns.|$|E
5|$|On 25 May 1942, Sōryū set {{out with}} the Combined Fleet's carrier {{striking}} force {{in the company of}} Kaga, Akagi, and Hiryū, which constituted the First and <b>Second</b> <b>Carrier</b> Divisions, for the attack on Midway Island. Her aircraft complement consisted of eighteen Zeros, sixteen D3As, eighteen B5Ns, and two prototypes of the new Yokosuka D4Y dive bomber. Also aboard were three A6M Zeros of the 6th Kōkūtai intended as a portion of the aerial garrison for Midway.|$|E
5|$|The Admiralty {{predicted}} that all Majestic-class carriers would require upgrades to their aircraft lifts and arrester gear {{in the early}} 1950s, to operate the faster and heavier carrier aircraft under development. Originally, the RAN wanted to upgrade Sydney to the same or similar standard as sister ship , after the <b>second</b> <b>carrier</b> was delivered. The installation of an angled flight deck and mirror landing aid, would have allowed Sydney to operate modern jet aircraft. However, financial and manpower restrictions led to the cancellation of this program.|$|E

5|$|At dusk, the Japanese {{turned away}} to the {{northwest}} to regroup and to refuel and the Americans turned west to close the distance. They discovered the retiring Japanese fleet during {{the afternoon of the}} following day and Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher ordered an air strike launched. They found the ships of the <b>Second</b> <b>Carrier</b> Division and hit Jun'yō with two bombs near her island. The ship was not badly damaged, but flight operations had to be suspended. Air Group 652 claimed seven American aircraft shot down and four more probably shot down, but lost eleven Zeros, plus another three that had to ditch. The air group was disbanded on 10 July with many of its remaining personnel being assigned to Air Group 653.|$|E
5|$|In January 1942, {{together}} {{with the rest of}} the First and Fifth Carrier Divisions, Akagi supported the invasion of Rabaul in the Bismarck Archipelago, as the Japanese moved to secure their southern defensive perimeter against attacks from Australia. She provided 20 B5Ns and 9 Zeros for the initial airstrike on Rabaul on 20 January 1942. The First Carrier Division attacked Allied positions at nearby Kavieng the following day, of which Akagi contributed 9 A6M Zeros and 18 D3As. On the 22nd, Akagis D3As and Zeros again attacked Rabaul before returning to Truk on 27 January. The <b>Second</b> <b>Carrier</b> Division, with Sōryū and Hiryū, had been detached to support the invasion of Wake Island on 23 December 1941 and did not reunite {{with the rest of the}} carrier mobile striking force until February 1942.|$|E
5|$|The First Carrier Division arrived off Shanghai on 13 August 1937 {{to support}} {{operations}} of the Japanese Army in China. Her aircraft complement consisted of 12 A4N fighters (plus four spares) and 15 D1A dive bombers. The dive bombers attacked targets in and near Shanghai. The Japanese fighters had their first aerial engagement on 22 August when four A4Ns surprised 18 Nationalist Curtiss Hawk III fighters and claimed to have shot down six without loss. The following day, four A4Ns claimed to have shot down nine Chinese fighters without loss to themselves. The carriers returned to Sasebo {{at the beginning of}} September to resupply before arriving off the South China coast on 21 September to attack Chinese forces near Canton. Nine fighters from Ryūjō escorted a raid on the city and claimed six of the defending fighters. While escorting another raid later that same day, the Japanese pilots claimed five aircraft shot down and one probably shot down. The dive bombers attacked targets near Canton until the ship sailed to the Shanghai area on 3 October. Her air group was flown ashore on 6 October to support Japanese forces near Shanghai and Nanking. Ryūjō returned home in November and briefly became a training ship before she was assigned to Rear Admiral Tomoshige Samejima's <b>Second</b> <b>Carrier</b> Division.|$|E

25|$|The FY2008 French defence budget {{included}} the necessary funding, €3 billion, for the ship.

Further doubts were cast on the project on 21 June 2008 when then French President Nicolas Sarkozy decided to suspend co-operation with Britain on the aircraft carrier.

The sudden transfer was viewed as a punitive exile imposed by outgoing Chief of Naval Operations King and Chief of Naval Personnel Randall Jacobs to deny Secretary Forrestal an ally in the bureaucratic battle King and Jacobs were waging against Forrestal over the direction of the postwar Navy. Forrestal resolved the conflict by replacing Jacobs with Vice Admiral Louis E. Denfeld and recalling Gingrich to Washington as Denfeld's assistant.|$|E

500|$|Following the Japanese ship-naming {{conventions}} {{for aircraft}} carriers, Hiryū was named [...] "Flying Dragon". The ship was laid {{down at the}} Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 8 July 1936, launched on 16 November 1937 and commissioned on 5 July 1939. She {{was assigned to the}} <b>Second</b> <b>Carrier</b> Division on 15 November. In September 1940, the ship's air group was transferred to Hainan Island to support the Japanese invasion of French Indochina. In February 1941, Hiryū supported the blockade of Southern China. Two months later, the 2nd Carrier Division, commanded by Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi, was assigned to the First Air Fleet, or Kido Butai, on 10 April. Hiryū returned to Japan on 7 August and began a short refit that was completed on 15 September. She became flagship of the Second Division from 22 September to 26 October while Sōryū was refitting.|$|E

They found only empty ocean, for the American carriers had immediately departed the area to return to Hawaii. The carriers quickly abandoned the chase and dropped anchor at Hashirajima anchorage on 22 April.

Light emission is strongly correlated with the injection of <b>second</b> <b>carriers</b> into nanocrystals that have been previously programmed with charges of the opposite sign. The properties of this device are well described by the model of a charge injection through Coulomb field modified tunneling processes.
