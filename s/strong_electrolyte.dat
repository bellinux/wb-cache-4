50|$|Strong salts or <b>strong</b> <b>electrolyte</b> salts are {{chemical}} salts {{composed of}} strong electrolytes. These ionic compounds dissociate completely in water. They are generally odourless and nonvolatile.|$|E
50|$|A <b>strong</b> <b>electrolyte</b> is a solute that completely, {{or almost}} completely, ionizes or dissociates in a solution. These ions are good {{conductors}} of electric current in the solution.|$|E
50|$|Aqueous {{solutions}} that conduct electric current efficiently contain <b>strong</b> <b>electrolytes,</b> while ones that conduct poorly {{are considered to}} have weak <b>electrolytes.</b> Those <b>strong</b> <b>electrolytes</b> are substances that are completely ionized in water, whereas the weak electrolytes exhibit only a small degree of ionization in water.|$|R
50|$|Two cases {{should be}} distinguished: <b>strong</b> <b>electrolytes</b> and weak electrolytes.|$|R
50|$|In 1921, Lewis was {{the first}} to propose an {{empirical}} equation describing the failure of <b>strong</b> <b>electrolytes</b> to obey the law of mass action, a problem that had perplexed physical chemists for twenty years. His empirical equations for what he called ionic strength were later confirmed to be in accord with the Debye-Hückel equation for <b>strong</b> <b>electrolytes,</b> published in 1923.|$|R
50|$|A <b>strong</b> <b>electrolyte</b> is a solute {{that exists}} in {{solution}} completely or nearly completely as ions. Again, the strength of an electrolyte {{is defined as the}} percentage of solute that is ions, rather than molecules. The higher the percentage, the stronger the electrolyte. Thus, even if a substance is not very soluble, but does dissociate completely into ions, the substance is defined as a <b>strong</b> <b>electrolyte.</b> Similar logic applies to a weak electrolyte. Strong acids and bases are good examples such as HCl, and H2SO4. These will all exist as ions in an aqueous medium.|$|E
5000|$|Strong {{electrolytes}} {{are believed}} to dissociate completely in solution. The conductivity of a solution of a <b>strong</b> <b>electrolyte</b> at low concentration follows Kohlrausch's Lawwhere [...] {{is known as the}} limiting molar conductivity, K is an empirical constant and c is the electrolyte concentration. (Limiting here means [...] "at the limit of the infinite dilution".) In effect, the observed conductivity of a <b>strong</b> <b>electrolyte</b> becomes directly proportional to concentration, at sufficiently low concentrations i.e. when As the concentration is increased however, the conductivity no longer rises in proportion.Moreover, Kohlrausch also found that the limiting conductivity of an electrolyte; ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{concentrated}} solution of this <b>strong</b> <b>electrolyte</b> {{has a lower}} vapor pressure than that of pure water at the same temperature. Strong acids, strong bases, and soluble ionic salts that are not weak acids or weak bases are strong electrolytes.|$|E

5000|$|The law holds good {{only for}} weak {{electrolytes}} and fails {{completely in the}} case of <b>strong</b> <b>electrolytes.</b> The value of 'α' is determined by conductivity measurements by applying the formula Λ/Λ∞. The value of 'α' determined at various dilutions of an electrolyte when substituted in Eq. (i) gives a constant value of K only {{in the case of}} weak electrolytes like CH3COOH, NH4OH, etc. the cause of failure of Ostwald's dilution law in the case of <b>strong</b> <b>electrolytes</b> is due to the following factors" ...|$|R

50|$|An {{electrolyte}} {{refers to}} a substance that contains free ions {{and can be used}} as an electrically conductive medium. Most of the solute does not dissociate in a weak electrolyte whereas in a <b>strong</b> <b>electrolyte</b> a higher ratio of solute dissociates to form free ions.|$|E
50|$|The copper is then {{stripped}} from organic {{phase in}} the strip stage into a strong sulfuric acid solution suitable for electrowinning. This strong acid solution is called barren electrolyte when it enters the cell, and <b>strong</b> <b>electrolyte</b> when it is copper bearing after reacting in the cell.|$|E
5000|$|If the solute dissociates in solution, {{then the}} number of moles of solute is {{increased}} by the van 't Hoff factor , which represents the true number of solute particles for each formula unit. For example, the <b>strong</b> <b>electrolyte</b> MgCl2 dissociates into one Mg2+ ion and two Cl− ions, so that if ionization is complete, i = 3 and [...]Where [...] is calculated with moles of solute i times initial moles and moles of solvent same as initial moles of solvent before dissociation. The measured colligative properties show that i is somewhat less than 3 due to ion association.|$|E
50|$|For <b>strong</b> <b>electrolytes,</b> {{a single}} {{reaction}} arrow {{shows that the}} reaction occurs completely in one direction, {{in contrast to the}} dissociation of weak electrolytes, which both ionize and re-bond in significant quantities.|$|R
5000|$|For <b>strong</b> <b>electrolytes,</b> such as salts, {{strong acids}} and strong bases, the molar {{conductivity}} depends only weakly on concentration. Based on experimental data Friedrich Kohlrausch (around the year 1900) proposed the non-linear law for strong electrolytes: ...|$|R
50|$|Sir Tarak Nath Palit Scholarship and Premchand Raychand {{student of}} the year award enabled J C Ghosh to travel to England for his {{doctoral}} degree at University College of Science in London. In London, he took up research on various problems of photochemistry and he led to the exposition of theory of anomaly of <b>strong</b> <b>electrolytes</b> and the ionization theory. His scientific research drew appreciation from many famous scientists such as Max Planck, William Bragg and Walther Nernst. In 1918, he was awarded D.Sc. for his research on <b>strong</b> <b>electrolytes.</b> During his stay in London, he worked for some time under Frederick G. Donnan.|$|R
50|$|A buffer {{solution}} contains an acid and its conjugate base or a base and its conjugate acid. Addition of the conjugate ion {{will result in}} a change of pH of the {{buffer solution}}. For example, if both sodium acetate and acetic acid are dissolved in the same solution they both dissociate and ionize to produce acetate ions. Sodium acetate is a <b>strong</b> <b>electrolyte</b> so it dissociates completely in solution. Acetic acid is a weak acid so it only ionizes slightly. According to Le Chatelier's principle, the addition of acetate ions from sodium acetate will suppress the ionization of acetic acid and shift its equilibrium to the left. Thus the percent dissociation of the acetic acid will decrease and the pH of the solution will increase. The ionization of an acid or a base is limited by the presence of its conjugate base or acid.|$|E
5000|$|Cohesion of {{sediment}} occurs {{with the small}} grain sizes associated with silts and clays, or particles smaller than 4ϕ on the phi scale. If these fine particles remain dispersed in the water column, Stokes law applies to the settling velocity of the individual grains, although due to sea water being a <b>strong</b> <b>electrolyte</b> bonding agent, flocculation occurs where individual particles create an electrical bond adhering each other together to form flocs. [...] "The face of a clay platelet has a slight negative charge where the edge has a slight positive charge, when two platelets come into close proximity with each other the face of one particle and {{the edge of the}} other are electrostatically attracted." [...] Flocs then have a higher combined mass which leads to quicker deposition through a higher fall velocity, and deposition in a more shoreward direction than they would have as the individual fine grains of clay or silt.|$|E
