In order to accommodate for the authorized uses of <b>spiromesifen</b> on tea in Japan, India and Indonesia, the EMS proposed to raise the existing MRL in tea to 50 mg/kg. The EMS drafted an evaluation report according to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA, the data on black tea are sufficient to derive a MRL proposal of 50 mg/kg for the existing enforcement residue definition (<b>spiromesifen)</b> and 80 mg/kg for the residue definition proposed by the peer review (the sum of <b>spiromesifen</b> and spiromesifen-enol, expressed as <b>spiromesifen).</b> An adequate analytical enforcement method is available to control residues of <b>spiromesifen</b> and spiromesifen-enol in dry commodities. The applicant has to confirm that the method can be also used for the determination of <b>spiromesifen</b> residues in tea, which is considered as a matrix difficult to analyse. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the authorized use of <b>spiromesifen</b> on tea will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a public health risk...|$|E
40|$|<b>Spiromesifen</b> {{is a novel}} {{insecticide}} and is classed as a tetronic acid derivative. It targets the insects' acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) enzyme, {{causing a}} reduction in lipid biosynthesis. At {{the time of this}} publication, there are no reports of resistance to this class of insecticides in insects although resistance has been observed in several mite species. The greenhouse whitefly Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood) is a serious pest of protected vegetable and ornamental crops in temperate regions of the world and <b>spiromesifen</b> is widely used in its control. Mortality rates of UK and European populations of T. vaporariorum to <b>spiromesifen</b> were calculated and up to 26 -fold resistance was found. We therefore sought to examine the molecular mechanism underlying <b>spiromesifen</b> resistance in this important pest. Pre-treatment with piperonyl butoxide did not synergize <b>spiromesifen,</b> suggesting a target-site resistance mechanism. The full length ACCase gene was sequenced for a range of T. vaporariorum strains and a strong association was found between <b>spiromesifen</b> resistance and a glutamic acid substitution with lysine in position 645 (E 645 K) of this gene. A TaqMan allelic discrimination assay confirmed these findings. Although this resistance is not considered sufficient to compromise the field performance of <b>spiromesifen,</b> this association of E 645 K with resistance is the first report of a potential target site mechanism affecting an ACCase inhibitor in an arthropod species...|$|E

40|$|The {{whitefly}} Trialeurodes vaporariorum Westwood (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) is {{a serious}} pest of protected vegetable and ornamental crops in most temperate regions of the world. Neonicotinoids, pymetrozine (a feeding blocker), <b>spiromesifen</b> (a tetronic acid derivative), bifenthrin (a pyrethroid), and pyriproxyfen (a juvenile hormone mimic) {{are among the most}} important insecticides used to control this species. Bioassays were used to quantify responses of recently-collected strains of T. vaporariorum to three neonicotinoids (imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and acetamiprid), pymetrozine, <b>spiromesifen,</b> bifenthrin, and pyriproxyfen. 454 pyrosequencing was exploited to generate the first transcriptome for this species. PCR-sequencing was used to identify mutations in the target proteins of <b>spiromesifen</b> and bifenthrin potentially associated with resistance to these compounds. Microarray sequencing technology was employed to investigate differences in gene expression associated with pyriproxyfen resistance. Resistance to neonicotinoids was age-specific in expression and consistently associated with resistance to pymetrozine, supporting a hypothesis of metabolic resistance analogous to that in the tobacco whitefly, Bemisia tabaci. Bioassays also showed moderate to high level resistance to <b>spiromesifen,</b> bifenthrin and pyriproxyfen in some strains. Analysis of the transcriptome identified genes encoding enzymes involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics (cytochrome P 450 s, carboxyl/cholinesterases, and glutathione-s transferases) and ones encoding insecticide targets: acetyl-coA carboxylase (ACCase), the target of <b>spiromesifen</b> and the voltage-gated sodium channel protein targeted by pyrethroids. PCR-sequencing revealed a single nucleotide polymorphism in the ACCase gene, which was consistently associated with <b>spiromesifen</b> resistance. Three amino-acid substitutions in the sodium channel of pyrethroid-resistant T. vaporariorum were found in positions previously implicated in pyrethroid resistance in B. tabaci.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Spiromesifen</b> {{is a novel}} insecticidal/acaricidal {{compound}} {{derived from}} spirocyclic tetronic acids that acts effectively against whiteflies and mites via inhibition of acetyl-CoA-carboxylase, a lipid metabolism enzyme. The effects of spiromesifenon thedevelopmental stages of thewhitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) were studied under laboratory conditions to generate baseline action thresholds for field evaluations of the compound. RESULTS: Adult B. tabaci mortality rate after <b>spiromesifen</b> treatment (5 mg L− 1) was 40 %. Treatment with 0. 5 mg L− 1 reduced fecundity per female by more than 80 %, and fertility was almost nil. LC 50 for eggs was 2. 6 mg L− 1, and for first instar 0. 5 mg L− 1. Scanning electronmicroscopy revealed that eggs laid by treated adult females had an abnormally perforated chorion, and females were unable to complete oviposition. Light and fluorescent microscopy showed significantly smaller eggs following treatment, and smaller, abnormally formedand improperly localizedbacteriomes in eggs andnymphs. Thenumber of ovarioles counted in females treated with 5 mg L− 1 was significantly reduced. <b>Spiromesifen</b> showed no cross-resistance with other commonly used insecticides from different chemical groups, and resistance monitoring in Israel showed no development of field resistance to this insecticide after 1 year of use.

40|$|Abstract. BACKGROUND: Insecticide {{resistance}} in Trialeurodes vaporariorum W. is {{unknown in the}} species’ northern distribution range where it inhabits mainly commercial greenhouses. Resistance development in whiteflies feeding on year-round crops in greenhouses is possible due to use of chemical treatments to back up biocontrol. We tested the response levels to <b>spiromesifen,</b> pymetrozine and imidacloprid in whiteflies collected from seven greenhouses within a 35 km radius in Western Finland. RESULTS: All except one (PR) population had LC 50 values below the recommended concentrations for the tested compounds. However, some populations showed reduced susceptibility to pymetrozine in comparison to reference susceptible population. Resistance ratios to pymetrozine were highly variable (RR 0. 5 - 39. 7) even among closely-located greenhouses and higher than those for imidacloprid (RR 1. 05 - 10. 5) and <b>spiromesifen</b> (RR 0. 8 - 11. 5). LC 50 values and application frequencies of pymetrozine correlated positively among the sampled populations.

40|$|Spirodiclofen {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{recently}} developed acaricides and belongs to the new family of spirocyclic tetronic acids (ketoenols). This new acaricidal family is an important chemical tool in resistance management strategies providing sustainable control of spider mites such as Tetranychus urticae. Spirodiclofen targets lipid biosynthesis mediated by direct inhibition of acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase). In this study, we investigated two genetically distant spider mite strains with high resistance to spirodiclofen. Despite the strong resistance levels to spirodiclofen (up to 680 -fold), only limited cross-resistance with other members of this group such as <b>spiromesifen</b> and spirotetramat could be detected. Amplification and sequencing of the ACCase gene from resistant and susceptible strains did not reveal common non-synonymous mutations, and expression levels of ACCase were similar in both resistant and susceptible strains, indicating the absence of target-site resistance. Furthermore, we collected genome-wide expression data of susceptible and resistant T. urticae strains using microarray technology. Analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed a broad response, but within the overlap of two resistant strains, several cytochrome P 450 s were prominent. Quantitative PCR confirmed the constitutive over-expression of CYP 392 E 7 and CYP 392 E 10 in resistant strains, and CYP 392 E 10 expression was highly induced by spirodiclofen. Furthermore, stage specific expression profiling revealed that expression levels were not significantly different between developing stages, but very low in eggs, matching the age-dependent resistance pattern previously observed. Functional expression of CYP 392 E 7 and CYP 392 E 10 confirmed that CYP 392 E 10 (but not CYP 392 E 7) metabolizes spirodiclofen by hydroxylation as identified by LC-MS/MS, and revealed cooperative substrate binding and a Km of 43 μM spirodiclofen. CYP 392 E 10 also metabolizes <b>spiromesifen,</b> but not spirotetramat. Surprisingly, no metabolism of the hydrolyzed spirodiclofen-enol metabolite could be detected.

Neste trabalho avaliou-se a eficácia de quatro inseticidas, ciantranilliprole foliar, ciantraniliprole solo, espiromesifeno e tiametoxam no controle das infecções primária e secundária do ToSRV, em tomateiros, transmitido por Bemisia tabaci biótipo B. Os tratamentos, confinados separadamente em gaiolas a prova de insetos, foram: controle, representado por tomateiros sadios e infectados, pulverizados com água, mais insetos avirulíferos; infecção primária, simulada com tomateiros sadios pulverizados com inseticida, mais insetos virulíferos e infecção secundária, simulada com tomateiros sadios e infectados com o ToSRV, pulverizados com inseticida, mais insetos avirulíferos. Nenhum inseticida foi eficiente no controle da infecção primária. No caso da simulação da infecção secundária, 4 % e 16 % respectivamente, dos tomateiros tratados com os inseticidas ciantraniliprole solo e ciantraniliprole foliar foram infectados, contra 84 % e 74 % de tomateiros infectados nos respectivos controles.

The authors have previously shown that Rickettsia in the B biotype of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae) increases this insect’s susceptibility to several insecticidal compounds. This communication reports {{a comparison of}} the susceptibilities of three isofemale strains of the Q biotype of B. tabaci harbouring different bacterial complements tomajor insecticides fromdifferent chemical groups: one strain harbouredonlyArsenophonus, one harboured Rickettsia and Arsenophonus and one harboured Arsenophonus andWolbachia. RESULTS: Thepresence of different symbiont combinations in the three strains had a significant influenceon their susceptibility to most of the insecticides tested. Thiamethoxam, imidacloprid, pyriproxyfen and <b>spiromesifen</b> had a significant influence on strains that had the double infections Rickettsia–Arsenophonus and Wolbachia–Arsenophonus, which also carried higher amounts of symbionts as assessed by quantitative real-time PCR.

40|$|Modern crop {{protection}} industry puts great efforts into {{the investigation and}} development of pesticides (insecticides, acaricides) with a novel mode of action, primarily because of increasingly important problem of resistance of pest organisms to pesticides. Resistance of many pest arthropod species (insects and mites) to insecticides and/or acaricides became a global phenomenon in the last decades. Therefore, pest management heavily relies on constant introduction of novel active ingredients in use, i. e. onthe alternative use {{of a number of}} compounds with different modes of action in order to save the longevity of newly developed products. Among pest arthropods, according to the potential for resistance development and a number of documented cases, spider mites (Acari: Tetranychidae), especially species Tetranychus urticae and Panonychusulmi, as well as certain species of whiteflies and leaf aphids (Homoptra: Aleyrodidae,Aphididae) stand out. In 2002, the company Bayer CropScience introduced spirodiclofen, a tetronic acid derivative and the first cyclic ketoenol, acaricide with a wide spectrum and a novel mode of action – inhibition of acetyl-CoA-carboxylase. Soon after, <b>spiromesifen</b> was introduced, also a derivative of tetronic acid, acaricide and insecticide intended for control of phytophagous mites and whiteflies. Spirotetramat, a tetramic acid derivative, and the third member of the ketoenol group, was recently commercialised as an insecticide efficient against whiteflies,leaf aphids and other harmful Homoptera. In this paper are presented the most significant properties of cyclic ketoenols, aiming at pointing to the possibilities and prospects of their use, but also to potential problems and limitations...|$|E

40|$|The two-spotted {{spider mite}} Tetranychus urticae is an {{economically}} important pest in many agricultural crops worldwide. Its high reproductive potential and extremely short life cycle, combined with the frequent acaricide applications usually required to maintain the population below economic threshold, facilitates rapid resistance build-up. This {{has led to the}} development of resistance against almost all commercially used compounds. In this study we tried to unravel the mechanisms behind the resistance against a number of acaricides with different mode of action at the toxicological, biochemical, genetic and molecular level. In a first series of experiments, we investigated pyrethroid resistance in Greek T. urticae strains. Combined data from toxicological bioassays and biochemical and synergistic studies indicated that although enhanced P 450 mono-oxygenase activities were associated with resistance, target site insensitivity proved to be the major resistance component. In order to get a better insight in the latter, a 3. 3 kb cDNA fragment of the T. urticae para sodium channel gene encompassing segment 4 of domain II to segment 6 of domain IV was obtained by a degenerate PCR strategy. The T. urticae sequence showed highest identity (56 %) to the scabies mite, Sarcoptes scabiei, and was phylogenetically classified within the divergent group of Arachnida. Comparison of resistant and susceptible strains identified the point mutation F 1538 I in segment 6 of domain III, which is known to confer strong resistance to pyrethroids, along with a second mutation (A 1215 D) in the intracellular linker connecting domains II and III, which still has an unknown role. Also, three alternative splicing variants were identified, of which two correspond to the mutually exclusive k/l exon pair already identified in insects. The mode of inheritance of resistance was confirmed to be almost completely recessive, which is consistent with studies on the target site mechanism for pyrethroids in other organisms. In T. urticae, organophosphate and carbamate resistance is often caused by acetylcholinesterase insensitivity. By combining toxicological, biochemical and molecular data from three reference laboratory and three organophosphate resistant (OP) strains, the AChE 1 mutations associated with resistance in T. urticae were characterised. The resistance ratios of the OP strains varied from 9 to 43 for pirimiphos-methyl, from 78 to 586 for chlorpyrifos, from 8 to 333 for methomyl and from 137 to 4164 for dimethoate. Compared to the reference strains, the insecticide concentration needed to inhibit 50 % of the AChE 1 activity in the OP strains was at least 2. 7, 55, 58 and 31 times higher for the OP pirimiphos-methyl, chlorpyrifos oxon, paraoxon and omethoate respectively, and 87 times higher for the carbamate carbaryl. By comparing the AChE 1 sequence between laboratory and OP strains, four amino acid substitutions were detected: (1) F 331 W which was present in all three OP strains; (2) T 280 A found in the three OP strains but not in all clones; (3) G 328 A, found in two OP strains; (4) A 201 S found in only one OP strain. F 331 W, G 328 A and A 201 S are possibly involved in resistance to organophosphate and carbamate insecticides. These findings were also confirmed by means of a structural model. F 331 W is probably the most important and the most common in T. urticae. It can be easily detected by a diagnostic PCR-RFLP assay developed in this study. We also evaluated the possible antagonism of organophosphate and carbamate insecticides on the toxicity of bifenazate in T. urticae when applied in mixtures. Bifenazate, a new and frequently used carbazate, is a pro-acaricide which needs to be activated by carboxylesterases. Two OP strains were used and several organophosphate (chlorpyrifos, azinphos methyl and phosmet) and carbamate (carbaryl and methomyl) insecticides were evaluated. Mixing chlorpyrifos with bifenazate strongly decreased bifenazate toxicity in both tested strains. However, in the strain with a higher esterase activity, antagonism decreased after 2 days. Of all other tested chemicals, only methomyl displayed an antagonistic effect 1 day after treatment. These findings indicate that mixing organophosphate and carbamate insecticides with bifenazate may inhibit bifenazate efficacy under field conditions, especially when resistant strains are present. Spirodiclofen, a recently developed and commercialized acaricide, is a selective, non-systemic tetronic acid derivative. In order to develop strategies to minimise resistance in the field to spirodiclofen, we selected a T. urticae population for spirodiclofen resistance in the laboratory. This selection yielded a strain with a resistance ratio of 274, determined on the larval stage. This strain was used to determine genetic, toxicological, biochemical and cross-resistance data. The egg stage of the resistant strain remained far more susceptible than the mobile stages. No cross-resistance was found against other acaricides, except for <b>spiromesifen,</b> another tetronic acid derivative. Based on synergist experiments and enzyme assays, it appeared that especially P 450 mono-oxygenases, but also esterases and glutathione-S-transferases, could be involved in the metabolic detoxification of spirodiclofen. Pre-treatment of the resistant females with the synergists PBO or DEF could increase the inhibitory effect of spirodiclofen on reproduction, again demonstrating the possible involvement of mono-oxygenases and esterases. Among the esterases of T. urticae, probably only a few are more expressed in spirodiclofen resistant strains, and these apparently prefer the purpose-designed substrate 1 -naphthyl 2, 2 -dimethylbutyrate. This was also confirmed by separating esterase isozymes by native isoelectric focusing. Because spirodiclofen interferes with lipid biosynthesis, total lipid content was measured in female adults. No significant differences between treated and non-treated female adults were found, both in the susceptible and resistant strain. However, the total lipid content in the resistant females was significantly higher than in susceptible females. The genetic analysis using crossing experiments showed that the resistance is inherited as an intermediate trait under control of more than one gene. Resistance to spirodiclofen in the laboratory selected strain exceeded by far the recommended field rate, showing the capacity for quick resistance development in the field. A good acaricide resistance management programme is necessary to prevent fast resistance build-up in the field. However, without selection pressure, resistance tends to be unstable and can decrease in the presence of susceptible individuals owing to the intermediate, polygenic inheritance mode. No evidence was found to support the existence of other resistance mechanisms, like mutations in the target site (ACCase) or overproduction of the target enzyme. In order to facilitate designing new ACCase inhibitor insecticides and understanding mechanism of resistance to currently used ACCase inhibitors, we tried to clone and express T. urticae ACCase using different expression systems. The most promising results were achieved by a baculovirus expression system and also by heat-shocking Codon Rare E. coli cells with the pET-ACC vector. More efforts should be done to overcome several problems in expressing this enzyme e. g. by optimizing conditions to get higher levels of expression, protein solubility, activity and stability. We also performed a practical screening in Dutch cut rose glasshouses due the fact that growers complained on failing spider mite control. In order to check whether control failure was caused by resistance, the susceptibility of 15 strains, sampled from infested roses, was tested to 11 acaricides: tebufenpyrad, milbemectin, abamectin, cyflumetofen, bifenthrin, <b>spiromesifen,</b> hexythiazox, etoxazole, bifenazate, acequinocyl and chlorpyrifos. Three doses were used to discern between resistance and susceptibility: the recommended field dose (FD), FD/ 5 and FD x 5. Ten of these strains were screened for known resistance mechanism such as elevated detoxifying enzyme activities and previously reported resistance mutations using biochemical and molecular diagnostics. Potential cross-resistance between acaricides was estimated by correlation analysis. The strains showed different levels of resistance to tested acaricides. Twelve out of 15 strains showed resistance against hexythiazox, and 9 out of 15 against bifenthrin and tebufenpyrad. Two strains were found which showed high levels of resistance to most tested insecticides, even against one which has not been registered in Europe. A high correlation was found between some acaricides, e. g. between abamectin and milbemectin. Without selection pressure, resistance seemed to be unstable in most cases, after one year. All field strains had an increased metabolic activity, compared to the susceptible strains. A number of amino acid substitutions known to be involved in resistance to different groups were present in different strains. The best example was the presence of the F 331 W substitution in the acetylcholine esterase, which was present in all field strains tested. The results obtained in this research may all together lead to a better understanding of acaricide resistance in T. urticae, which, in turn, may lead to more efficient resistance management programs...|$|E
