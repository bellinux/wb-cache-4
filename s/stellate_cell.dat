25|$|The {{pathological}} {{hallmark of}} cirrhosis {{is the development}} of scar tissue that replaces normal parenchyma. This scar tissue blocks the portal flow of blood through the organ, raising the blood pressure and disturbing normal function. Recent research shows the pivotal role of the <b>stellate</b> <b>cell,</b> a cell type that normally stores vitamin A, in the development of cirrhosis. Damage to the hepatic parenchyma (due to inflammation) leads to activation of stellate cells, which increases fibrosis (through production of myofibroblasts) and obstructs hepatic blood flow. In addition, stellate cells secrete TGF-β1, which leads to a fibrotic response and proliferation of connective tissue. Furthermore, it secretes TIMP 1 and 2, naturally occurring inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases, which prevents them from breaking down the fibrotic material in the extracellular matrix.|$|E

We determined the PAF receptor in hepatic <b>stellate</b> <b>cells</b> by saturation binding technique and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), {{and the effects of}} PAF and its antagonist BN 52021 on prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) release by <b>stellate</b> <b>cells.</b> RESULTS: Scatchard analysis indicated the presence of PAF receptor with dissociation constant (Kd) of 4. 66 nmol/L and maximum binding capacity (Bmax) of 24. 65 fmol/μg in cirrhotic <b>stellate</b> <b>cells.</b> Compared with the control, the maximum PAF binding capacity increased significantly (Bmax: 24. 65 ± 1. 96 fmol/μg.

The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the changes in morphology, distribution, percentage and alpha-smooth muscle actin expression of hepatic <b>stellate</b> <b>cells</b> in normal and cirrhotic livers, and to correlate activated hepatic <b>stellate</b> <b>cells</b> with the progression of fibrosis. Human liver biopsies (n= 121) were divided in five groups: 1) normal livers (controls); 2) cirrhosis post-HCV hepatitis; 3) cirrhosis post-HBV hepatitis; 4) non viral related cirrhosis; 5) recurrent HCV hepatitis after orthotopic liver transplantation. Samples immunostained with anti alpha-smooth muscle actin antibody by immunoperoxidase method were semi-quantitatively evaluated. Liver fibrosis was quantified by computer image analysis on specimens stained with Masson's trichrome. In normal adult livers <b>stellate</b> <b>cells</b> were very rarely stained for alpha-smooth muscle actin. In cirrhotic livers, a strongly enhanced percentage of <b>stellate</b> <b>cells</b> expressing alpha-smooth muscle actin was detected in cirrhotic fragments with respect to the control group, with a significant correlation between alpha-smooth muscle actin positive <b>stellate</b> <b>cells</b> and the volume fraction of fibrosis.

40|$|Development of desmin-positive hepatic <b>stellate</b> <b>cells</b> was {{studied in}} mice using double immunofluorescent {{techniques}} and in vitro cultures with special {{attention given to}} their cell lineages. Several studies recently reported {{on the presence of}} cells that are immunologically reactive with both antidesmin and anticytokeratin antibodies in young fetal rat livers, and suggested the possibility that these cells give rise to hepatocytes and hepatic <b>stellate</b> <b>cells.</b> At early stages of mouse liver development, <b>stellate</b> <b>cells</b> with desmin-positive filaments were scattered in the liver parenchyma. However, the <b>stellate</b> <b>cells</b> definitely differed from hepatoblasts and hepatocytes in terms of their morphology and expression of desmin and hepatoblast and hepatocyte-specific E-cadherin in the liver. Fetal hepatoblasts and hepatocytes did not react with antidesmin antibodies, nor did desmin-positive <b>stellate</b> <b>cells</b> express E-cadherin in vivo and in vitro. Thus it is likely that desmin-positive <b>stellate</b> <b>cells</b> and hepatoblasts belong to different cell lineages. In the fetal liver, the desmin-positive <b>stellate</b> <b>cells</b> surrounded blood vessels, and extended their processes to haematopoietic cells and megakaryocytes.

40|$|Background—The {{pathogenesis}} of pancreatic fibrosis is unknown. In the liver, <b>stellate</b> <b>cells</b> (vitamin A storing cells) play {{a significant}} role in the development of fibrosis.  Aims—To determine whether <b>cells</b> resembling hepatic <b>stellate</b> <b>cells</b> are present in rat pancreas, and if so, to compare their number with the number of <b>stellate</b> <b>cells</b> in the liver, and isolate and culture these cells from rat pancreas.  Methods—Liver and pancreatic sections from chow fed rats were immunostained for desmin, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and α smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Pancreatic <b>stellate</b> shaped <b>cells</b> were isolated using a Nycodenz gradient, cultured on plastic, and examined by phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy, and by immunostaining for desmin, GFAP, and α-SMA.  Results—In both liver and pancreatic sections, <b>stellate</b> shaped <b>cells</b> were observed; these were positive for desmin and GFAP and negative for α-SMA. Pancreatic <b>stellate</b> shaped <b>cells</b> had a periacinar distribution.

40|$|BACKGROUND—The {{pathogenesis}} of pancreatic fibrosis is unknown. In the liver, <b>stellate</b> <b>cells</b> play a {{major role}} in fibrogenesis by synthesising increased amounts of collagen and other extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins when activated by profibrogenic mediators such as cytokines and oxidant stress.  AIMS—To determine whether cultured rat pancreatic <b>stellate</b> <b>cells</b> produce collagen and other ECM proteins, and exhibit signs of activation when exposed to the cytokines platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) or transforming growth factor β (TGF-β).  METHODS—Cultured pancreatic <b>stellate</b> <b>cells</b> were immunostained for the ECM proteins procollagen III, collagen I, laminin, and fibronectin using specific polyclonal antibodies. For cytokine studies, triplicate wells of cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of PDGF or TGF-β.  RESULTS—Cultured pancreatic <b>stellate</b> <b>cells</b> stained strongly positive for all ECM proteins tested. Incubation of cells with 1, 5, and 10 ng/ml PDGF led to a significant dose related increase in cell counts as well as in the incorporation of 3 H-thymidine into DNA. <b>Stellate</b> <b>cells</b> exposed to 0. 25, 0. 5, and 1 ng/ml TGF-β showed a dose dependent increase in α smooth muscle actin expression and increased collagen synthesis. In addition, TGF-β increased the expression of PDGF receptors on <b>stellate</b> <b>cells.</b>  CONCLUSIONS—Pancreatic <b>stellate</b> <b>cells</b> produce collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins, and respond to the cytokines PDGF and TGF-β by increased proliferation and increased collagen synthesis.

An increase in the amount of alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive hepatic <b>stellate</b> <b>cells</b> in zone 1 at t 1 was significantly (P <. 006) related to subsequent cirrhotic evolution. In conclusion, in liver allografts with recurrent viral hepatitis, the activation of hepatic <b>stellate</b> <b>cells</b> is an early event. An increased number of alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive hepatic <b>stellate</b> <b>cells</b> in zone 1 may represent an unfavorable event related to cirrhotic evolution...|$|R
