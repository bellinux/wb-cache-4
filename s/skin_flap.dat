5|$|Another 2016 {{study used}} laser-stimulated {{fluorescence}} imaging {{to analyze the}} internal structure of the bristles. The highly cornified bristles are arranged in tight clusters of three to six individual bristles, with each bristle being filled with pulp. The authors considered the bristles as being homologous to the quills of Tianyulong, the elongated broad filamentous feathers (EBFFs) of Beipiaosaurus, and possibly the feathers of birds as well. Similar bristles are found in extant birds such as the horned screamer; these structures differ from feathers in {{that they do not}} develop from a follicle, but both arise from discrete cell populations. A darkened soft-tissue structure was also found near the jugal horn; this may represent a keratinous sheath or a <b>skin</b> <b>flap.</b>|$|E
5|$|Parasaurolophus walkeri {{is known}} from one {{specimen}} which might contain a pathology. The skeleton shows a v-shaped gap or notch in the vertebrae {{at the base}} of the neck. Originally thought to be pathologic, Parks published a second interpretation of this, as a ligament attachment to support the head. The crest would attach to the gap via muscles or ligaments, and be used to support the head while bearing a frill, like predicted to exist in some hadrosaurids. One other possibility, is that during preparation, the specimen was damaged, creating the possible pathology. The notch, however, is still considered more likely to be a pathology, even though some illustrations of Parasaurolophus restore the <b>skin</b> <b>flap.</b>|$|E
5|$|The most {{noticeable}} feature was the cranial crest, which protruded {{from the rear}} of the head and was made up of the premaxilla and nasal bones. William Parks, who named the genus, hypothesized that a ligament ran from the crest to the notch to support the head, and cited the presence of possibly pathological notch as evidence. Although this idea seems unlikely, Parasaurolophus is sometimes restored with a <b>skin</b> <b>flap</b> from the crest to the neck. The crest was hollow, with distinct tubes leading from each nostril to the end of the crest before reversing direction and heading back down the crest and into the skull. The tubes were simplest in P. walkeri, and more complex in P. tubicen, where some tubes were blind and others met and separated. While P. walkeri and P. tubicen had long crests with only slight curvature, P. cyrtocristatus had a short crest with a more circular profile.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Diabetes {{mellitus}} {{leads to}} tissue damage by erythrocyte aggregation and an endothelial dysfunction-mediated disturbance in vascularization. These mechanisms facilitate {{the formation of}} skin wounds. As <b>skin</b> <b>flaps</b> are often used {{in the treatment of}} diabetic wounds, enhancing the blood supply and lowering blood glucose levels have emerged as important factors to increase the success of treatment using <b>skin</b> <b>flaps.</b> Therefore, in this study, the effectiveness of captopril and angiotensin II treatments were investigated to determine if they increased blood flow to <b>skin</b> <b>flaps</b> to protect their viability in an experimental diabetic rat model. Material and Methods: The experiment was conducted using 45 rats. Nine constituted the sham group, whereas diabetes was induced in 36 of them by an intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. <b>Skin</b> <b>flaps</b> (3 × 8 cm in diameter) were prepared, separated, and consequently reimplanted with staplers to their original place at the dorsum of the rats. Diabetic rats were treated with saline (n= 9), angiotensin II (n= 9), captopril (n= 9), captopril+angiotensin II (n= 9) during the postoperative period. Flap viability was assessed by clinical and histopathological findings. Results: The percentage of flap viability in diabetic rats was found to be significantly higher in the captopril+angiotensin II group than in the captopril group and was lowest in the angiotensin II group. Additionally, both individual and combined use of captopril and angiotensin II were found to increase the intensity of blood vessels compared to the administration of saline alone in diabetic rats.

In the laboratory I examined the role of XO and its potent inhibitor allopurinol in the IRI of <b>skin</b> and myocutaneous <b>flaps.</b> I have found negligible levels of XO enzyme in pig and human skin when compared to the rat. I have also found that no beneficial effect on survival could be observed by treating the flaps with several different dose regimens of allopurinol.

25|$|The paramedian {{forehead}} flap is {{the premier}} autologous skin graft for {{the reconstruction of}} a nose, by replacing any of the aesthetic nasal subunits, especially regarding the problems of different tissue thickness and skin color. The forehead flap is an axial <b>skin</b> <b>flap</b> based upon the supraorbital artery (an ophthalmic artery branch) and the supratrochlear artery (an ophthalmic artery terminus), which can be thinned to the subdermal plexus {{in order to enhance}} the functional and aesthetic outcome of the nose. Restricted length is a practical application limit of the paramedian forehead flap, especially when the patient has a low frontal hairline. In such a patient, a small portion of scalp skin can be included to the flap, but it does have a different skin texture and does continue growing hair; such mismatching is avoided with the transverse emplacement of the flap along the hairline; yet that portion of the <b>skin</b> <b>flap</b> is random, and so risks a greater incidence of necrosis.|$|E
25|$|A wound {{greater than}} 15mm in {{diameter}} can be corrected with a paramedian forehead flap, which will reconstruct either the entire nasal dorsum or the lateral {{wall of the}} nose, as required. The surgical management of such wounds (< 15nbsp&mm dia.) usually requires enlarging the wound as necessary, {{in order for the}} skin graft to comprehend the entire aesthetic subunit being corrected. Moreover, if the wound comprehends the dorsum and the lateral wall of the nose, then a cheek-advancement <b>skin</b> <b>flap</b> is the applicable correction for replacing the lateral nasal skin up to its junction with the dorsum; afterwards, a paramedian forehead flap is applied to resurface the nasal dorsum.|$|E
25|$|After the nasolabial flap {{has been}} emplaced, the flap donor-site wound is sutured closed. For a wound of the lateral nasal wall {{that is less}} than 15mm wide, the flap donor-site can be closed primarily, with sutures. For a wound wider than 15mm—especially a wound that comprehends the alar lobule and the lateral wall of the nose—primary closure is not indicated, because such a wound closure imposes {{excessive}} stresses upon the <b>skin</b> <b>flap,</b> thereby risking either blanching (whitening) or distortion, or both. Such risks are avoided by advancing (moving) {{the skin of the}} cheek towards the nasofacial junction, where it is sutured to the deep tissues. Furthermore, a narrow wound, less than 1mm wide can be allowed to heal by secondary intention (autonomous re-epithelialisation).|$|E

Seventy-five consecutive immediate prosthetic reconstructions following Wise-pattern mastectomy on 63 patients were retrospectively analysed to assess risk factors for <b>skin</b> <b>flaps</b> ischemic complications and their impact on aesthetic outcomes and patients’ satisfaction. We investigated the influence of two clusters of hypothetic risk factors: patient-related (age, body mass index, smoke, neoadjuvant chemotherapy) and procedure-related (implant weight, breast weight, curative-prophylactic procedure, axillary lymph nodes dissection) by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses with Firth's bias correction. Significant risk factors from both analyses were considered as important selection criteria that expose the patients to higher risk of <b>skin</b> <b>flaps</b> ischemic complications. Moreover, patients were divided into 3 subgroups according to postoperative outcome: group A healed uneventfully, B with partial thickness and C with full thickness necrosis. Aesthetic evaluations scores of subgroups were analyzed and compared using a Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance, and Dunn’s test for multiple comparisons between subgroups. From our statistical investigation smoking and weight of prosthesis > 468 g showed significant association with <b>skin</b> <b>flaps</b> ischemic complications, additionally analysis of aesthetic evaluations confirmed differences between subgroups (p= 0. 001), and multiple testing showed significance between subgroup A and C (p< 0. 05).

25|$|The surgeon replaces missing {{parts with}} tissue of like quality and quantity; nasal lining with mucosa, {{cartilage}} with cartilage, bone with bone, and skin with skin that best match the native skin color and skin {{texture of the}} damaged nasal subunit. For such surgical repairs, skin flaps are preferable to skin grafts, because skin flaps generally are the superior remedy for matching the color and the texture of nasal skin, better resist tissue contracture, and provide better vascularisation of the nasal skeleton; thus, when there is sufficient skin to allow tissue harvesting, nasal skin is the best source of nasal skin. Furthermore, despite its notable scarring propensity, the nasal <b>skin</b> <b>flap</b> is the prime consideration for nasal reconstruction, because of its greater verisimilitude.|$|E

The adequate undermining of the <b>skin</b> <b>flaps</b> of a wound is a commonly used technique for achieving the closure of large tension wounds; however, the use of tension to approximate and suture the <b>skin</b> <b>flaps</b> can cause ischemic marginal necrosis. The {{purpose of this study is}} to use elastic rubber bands to relieve the tension of direct wound closure for simultaneously minimizing the risks of wound dehiscence and wound edge ischemia that lead to necrosis. Materials and MethodsThis retrospective study was conducted to evaluate our clinical experiences with 22 large wounds, which involved performing primary closures under a considerable amount of tension by using elastic rubber bands in a skin-stretching technique following a wide undermining procedure. Assessment of the results entailed complete wound healing and related complications. ResultsAll 22 wounds in our study showed fair to good results except for one. The mean success rate was approximately 95. 45 %.
