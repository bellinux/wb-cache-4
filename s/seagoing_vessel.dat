25|$|The {{report was}} {{considered}} to be of poor quality. It had a disjointed narrative and repeatedly failed to cite the relevant evidence. In it, Spicer concluded that the collision was primarily the fault of Voyagers bridge crew, in that they neglected to maintain an effective lookout and lost awareness of the carrier's location, although he did not blame individual officers. When reporting on the contribution of Melbourne and those aboard her to the collision, Spicer specifically indicated failures of Robertson and two other bridge officers, as they did not alert Voyager to the danger she was in, and appeared to not take measures to prevent Melbourne from colliding. Robertson was marked for transfer to , a training base in Sydney, and the admirals of the RAN decided to prevent Robertson from serving on Melbourne or any other <b>seagoing</b> <b>vessel</b> in the future. Robertson submitted his resignation from the Navy on 10 September 1964, two days after receiving official notice of his new posting, which he saw as a demotion. The media considered that Robertson had been made a scapegoat for the incident.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{practically}} none of {{the original}} timber survived, {{the form of the}} ship was perfectly preserved. Stains in the sand had replaced the wood but had preserved many construction details. Nearly all of the iron planking rivets were in their original places. It was possible to survey the original ship, which was found to be [...] long, pointed at either end with tall rising stem and stern posts and widening to [...] in the beam amidships with an inboard depth of [...] over the keel line. From the keel board, the hull was constructed clinker-fashion with nine planks on either side, fastened with rivets. Twenty-six wooden frames strengthened the form. Repairs were visible: this had been a <b>seagoing</b> <b>vessel</b> of excellent craftsmanship, but there was no descending keel. The decking, benches and mast were removed. In the fore and aft sections, there were thorn-shaped oar-rests along the gunwales, indicating {{that there may have been}} positions for forty oarsmen.
