5|$|As Olivia {{enters the}} park, she is {{passed by a}} man riding a penny-farthing bicycle. As these have not been shown elsewhere, it does not <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> {{that they are a}} common means of {{transportation}} in the alternate universe, but rather that this is a reference to The Prisoner, in which similar mind-games were used against an agent being held prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Because Baltimore's {{electorate}} {{is overwhelmingly}} Democratic, whoever won the Democratic primary election {{was seen as}} the favorite over the Republican nominee in the general election. Baltimore's large African American population initially made it <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> that the next mayor would also be African American. Kweisi Mfume was the preferred candidate of local politicians, but he opted not to run. Though Carl Stokes and Lawrence Bell, members of the City Council, declared for the race, local leaders were underwhelmed with the quality of declared candidates.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, war between Britain and Germany began to <b>seem</b> <b>likely.</b> Ramsgate's {{location}} {{on both the}} English Channel and North Sea and its proximity to the Thames Estuary, its large port facilities, and its close proximity to RAF Manston made it a likely target for heavy aerial bombing and as a landing site for any German invasion of Britain. With this in mind the town's borough engineer and surveyor, R. D. Brimmell, devised a scheme in 1938 for a network of tunnels beneath the town, {{to serve as a}} vast deep-level air-raid shelter for the town's inhabitants.|$|E
25|$|It <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> {{that the}} {{standardization}} {{of the script}} will be greatly influenced {{by the need to}} typeset it on computers.

25|$|There are no {{designated}} equestrian trails {{within the}} wilderness. While mountain bike usage {{is currently a}} matter of debate as the CPSLMP is updated, and not specifically prohibited, it does not <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> that it will be allowed.|$|E
25|$|The genus {{grows in}} areas where there are {{significant}} periods of dry months that range from five months to ten months. It would <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> that the Atlantic and India Oceans pay {{a major role in}} the creation of weather conducive to rainfall, not to mention mountain ranges. For example, the Madagascar dry deciduous forests with their long dry season and severe limestone ridden soils provide one ideal setting for pachypodium.|$|E
25|$|The postwar {{years were}} Edrich's heyday and in 1947 he broke Tom Hayward's record, scoring 3,539 {{runs in the}} season and not being much overshadowed by Denis Compton, who scored 3,816. Compton's and Edrich's {{aggregates}} remain the highest ever in an English cricket season, and with {{the reduction in the}} number of first-class matches <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> never to be overtaken. In addition to his runs, Edrich also took 67 wickets in the same season.|$|E

25|$|The m-text depends {{largely on}} manuscripts M and L, which are very early copies, made not long after Bede's death. Both <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> to have been taken from the original, though this is not certain. Three further manuscripts, U, E and N, are all {{apparently}} the descendants of a Northumbrian manuscript that does not survive but which went to the continent in the late-8th century. These three are all early manuscripts, but are less useful than might be thought, since L and M are themselves {{so close to the}} original.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} Bunyaviridae, {{each of the}} three {{segments}} has a consensus 3'-terminal nucleotide sequence (AUCAUCAUC), which is complementary to the 5' terminal sequence and is distinct from those of the other four genera in the family. These sequences appear to form panhandle structures which <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> {{to play a role in}} replication and encapsidation facilitated by binding with the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein. The large segment is 6530-6550 nucleotides (nt) in length, the medium is 3613-3707 nt in length and the small is 1696-2083 nt in length.|$|E
25|$|Genghis {{then sent}} a 500-man caravan of Muslims to {{establish}} official trade ties with Khwarezmia. However Inalchuq, {{the governor of}} the Khwarezmian city of Otrar, had the members of the caravan that came from Mongolia arrested, claiming that the caravan was a conspiracy against Khwarezmia. It seems unlikely, however, that any members of the trade delegation were spies. Nor does it <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> that Genghis was trying to initiate a conflict with the Khwarezmid Empire with the caravan, considering he was making steady progress against a faltering Jin empire in northern China at that very moment.|$|E

25|$|It {{does not}} <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> that {{standards}} for copper wire purity will increase beyond the current minimum value of 101% IACS. Although 6-nines copper (99.9999% pure) has been produced in small quantities, {{it is extremely}} expensive and probably unnecessary for most commercial applications such as magnet, telecommunications, and building wire. The electrical conductivity of 6-nines copper and 4-nines copper (99.99% pure) is nearly the same at ambient temperature, although the higher-purity copper has a higher conductivity at cryogenic temperatures. Therefore, for non-cryogenic temperatures, 4-nines copper will probably remain the dominant material for most commercial wire applications.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{engaging}} in observable compulsions, {{the person with}} this subtype might perform more covert, mental rituals, or might feel driven to avoid the situations in which particular thoughts <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> to intrude. As {{a result of this}} avoidance, people can struggle to fulfill both public and private roles, even if they place great value on these roles and even if they had fulfilled the roles successfully in the past. Moreover, the individual's avoidance can confuse others who do not know its origin or intended purpose, {{as it did in the}} case of a man whose wife began to wonder why he would not hold their infant child. The covert mental rituals can take up a great deal of a person's time during the day.|$|E
25|$|The progeny in {{this case}} {{received}} two dominant alleles linked on one chromosome (referred to as coupling or cis arrangement). However, after crossover, some progeny could have received one parental chromosome with a dominant allele for one trait (e.g. Purple) linked to a recessive allele for a second trait (e.g. round) with the opposite being true for the other parental chromosome (e.g. red and Long). This {{is referred to as}} repulsion or a trans arrangement. The phenotype here would still be purple and long but a test cross of this individual with the recessive parent would produce progeny with much greater proportion of the two crossover phenotypes. While such a problem may not <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> from this example, unfavourable repulsion linkages do appear when breeding for disease resistance in some crops.|$|E

25|$|When {{the genetic}} {{abnormalities}} {{that occur in}} advanced colorectal cancer were first identified, {{one of the most}} frequent events was found to be loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of region 18q21. One of the first genes sequenced in this region was DCC, and it was subsequently analyzed for tumour suppressor activity. However, the lack of somatic DCC mutations made it <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> that the nearby SMAD2 and SMAD4 genes were the reason for 18q21 LOH. The fact that DCC heterozygotes had no increased rates of cancer, even when crossed with mice carrying Apc mutations, solidified this viewpoint. The finding that DCC was a receptor for netrin-1 involved in axon guidance initially moved research away from DCC in cancer. It was later realized that DCC may be involved in directing cell motility, which has direct implications for metastatic cancer.|$|E
25|$|The {{foregoing}} examples {{present the}} Salticidae as textbook examples of active hunters; they would hardly <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> to build webs {{other than those}} used in reproductive activities, and in fact, most species really do not build webs to catch prey. However, exceptions occur, though even those that do build capture webs generally also go hunting like other salticids. Some Portia species, for example, spin capture webs that are functional, though not as impressive as some orb webs of the Araneidae; Portia webs are of an unusual funnel shape and apparently adapted to the capture of other spiders. Spartaeus species, on the other hand, largely capture moths in their webs. In their review of the ethology of Salticidae, Richman and Jackson speculate on whether such web building is {{a relic of the}} evolution of this family from web-building ancestors.|$|E
25|$|In 1693, {{a part of}} the {{woodland}} adjoining the Ashdown Forest was felled {{to clear}} the grounds of the former house on the present site. The estate, which had once been part of a medieval deer park, later passed to other families and in 1766 the owner paid window tax on forty-one windows, making the Bower the fifth largest out of the 150 taxable residences in East Grinstead. It seems likely that the present Bower House, a Tudor farmhouse in the village of Hammerwood, is of no direct relation. There existed a previous building on the site of what was to become Hammerwood Lodge (foundations and walls in the west of the central block of the current house have been dated to pre-1792), and it would <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> that this was the principal dwelling of the Bower.|$|E
50|$|This {{seems to}} clarify that Briget's {{marriage}} to Paget came {{after the death of}} her first husband. It <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> there was only a very brief interlude: the register records George Thrushe being buried on 10 November 1601, after dying of consumption. It <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> that George Thrushe was Briget's first husband, although Hall also records his name as John in his pedigree of the Masterson family.|$|R

25|$|The book {{tells the}} story of the quest for Captain Grant of the Britannia. After finding a bottle the captain had cast into the ocean after the Britannia is shipwrecked, Lord and Lady Glenarvan of Scotland contact Mary and Robert, the young {{daughter}} and son of Captain Grant, through an announcement in a newspaper. The government refuses to launch a rescue expedition, but Lord and Lady Glenarvan, moved by the children's condition, decide to do it by themselves. The main difficulty is that the coordinates of the wreckage are mostly erased, and only the latitude (37 degrees) is known; thus, the expedition would have to circumnavigate the 37th parallel south. The bottle was retrieved from a shark's stomach, so it is impossible to trace its origin by the currents. Remaining clues consist of a few words in three languages. They are re-interpreted several times throughout the novel to make various destinations <b>seem</b> <b>likely.</b>|$|E
25|$|In June 2004 {{the first}} {{performances}} for about 70 years {{took place in}} the theatre, first in its foyer then in July in the theatre itself. Although conditions were far from ideal, the audience was able to see the potential of this very large space – originally seating 3,000, it cannot currently be licensed for {{more than a couple of}} hundred. It is intended that the theatre will one day reopen, but much costly restoration will be required first. It will never again reach a seating capacity of 3,000 (not least because one balcony was removed in the early part of the 20th century as a fire precaution, when films started to be shown there), but it does <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> that a capacity of more than 1,000 may one day be achieved. A major season of the theatre company Complicite was planned for 2005 but the project, which would have included some repair and access work, was cancelled due to higher-than-anticipated costs.|$|E
25|$|Founded at Canterbury in 1084-5, St Gregory's Abbey {{began to}} claim, from 1087, {{to have the}} relics of both St Mildrith and her {{successor}} as Abbess, St Eadburg, having translated them from Lyminge Abbey. At {{the time of the}} translation, two or three years before, they had translated the relics of St Eadburg and an unknown saint. The production of a full account of the lives of Domne Eafe and Mildrith appears to have been made to further this claim. That they produced a text that is broadly very harmonious with other known texts suggests they had a good source document, and it would <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> that a Thanet-based text had come from Lyminge with the relics. Goscelin, in a document known as the contra usurpatores, strongly refuted their claim on Mildrith. In doing so he describes two separate documents produced by the Gregorians, and it would appear these are now combined into {{what is known as the}} Gotha text.|$|E
