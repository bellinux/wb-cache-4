50|$|There are two Siemens V94 3/A {{gas turbine}} groups with 257 MWe net {{alternator}} each. The gas turbine discharge, outgoing , produce steam, through a so-called HRSG (Heat recovery steam generator) which then feeds a steam turbine group (with high, medium and low pressure turbines) driving a 122 MWe net alternator. The <b>solar</b> <b>component</b> integrates the steam {{production of the}} gas turbines through a SSG (Solar Steam Generator), up {{to a maximum of}} 15 MWth (thermal net power), in conditions of maximum insolation. The HSRG-1 and HSRG-2 operate in parallel with the SSG, shortly before entering steam turbine group. This means that every unit of thermal energy coming from the solar field delivers electricity only in accordance with the coefficient of efficiency of the steam section, not being involved in the gas turbines. The overall efficiency of the combined cycle turns out to be 56%, much less the steam section alone.|$|E

50|$|Martin Next Generation Solar Energy Center is {{the solar}} parabolic-trough {{component}} {{of an integrated}} solar combined cycle 1150 MW plant, in western Martin County, Florida, just north of Indiantown, built by Florida Power & Light Company (FPL). The ISCC plant {{is part of the}} Martin Plant site which consists of 5 units. Unit 1 & Unit 2 are 800 MW steam electric generating units that use natural gas and low-sulfur residual oil. Unit 3 & Unit 4 are 500 MW natural gas-fired combined cycle units. Unit 8 is a natural gas fired 4-on-1 combined cycle unit with a nominal capacity of 1150 MW. Light oil is used as backup. Unit 8, placed into commercial operation in 2005, is integrated with the solar plant. Unit 8 features four 170 MW gas turbines, one 470 MW steam turbine, and a single condenser and cooling tower.The single solar field circuit heats 4 steam generators, after each gas turbine. The Martin solar thermal facility is designed to provide steam for FPL's existing Martin Unit 8 combined cycle unit, thus reducing FPL's use of natural gas. No additional capacity (MW) will result from the operation of the solar thermal facility.The Solar Energy Center has an array of approximately 190,000-mirror parabolic troughs on about 500 acre of the Martin County plant.The solar collectors feed heat to the existing steam plant, displacing gas generated electricity at an estimated rate of 155,000 MWh per year. The 2012 solar-derived production was about 89,000 MWh of power, according to records filed with the state’s Public Service Commission, which was 42% less than projected when the plant got approval. It is to consider that the <b>solar</b> <b>component</b> can generate electrical energy only if the four gas turbines are in operation, otherwise the 470 MW steam turbine will not move. When gas turbines are stopped, the solar heat is used to keep the steam turbine in temperature, in order to facilitate a more rapid start-up. Lauren Engineers & Constructors (Abilene, TX) was the EPC contractor for the project. Construction began in 2008 and was completed by the end of 2010.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{previous}} {{study of the}} World Bank assessed the international competitiveness of five MENA countries, where Egypt showed significant potential to develop several key solar industries. The analysis revealed that Egypt's key strengths on production factors are: low cost of labor and of energy for industrial consumers; availability of glass, steel, and stainless steel; and a strong manufacturing capability and that Egypt's planned deployment of solar energy up to 2020 can be a driver. In this paper, current <b>solar</b> <b>component</b> manufacturing value chains and Egypt's industrial base and potential markets to be served are analyzed to identify the value chains in which Egypt's manufacturing sector could participate. Several solar industries (Heat transfer equipment, Pumping equipment, Mirror, Storage tanks, and Structures) are identified as attractive to be developed in Egypt. A <b>solar</b> <b>component</b> manufacturing industry would {{lower the cost of}} the solar plants to be built, increase the country's energy security and contribute to regional renewable energy development. Egypt has the opportunity to enlarge its <b>solar</b> <b>component</b> manufacturing base, which, according to the assumptions in this study, would create up to 3, 000 jobs, most of them in installation activities.

40|$|Much of the {{developing}} world lacks access to a dependable source of energy. Agricultural societies such as Mozambique and Papua New Guinea could sustain a reliable energy source through the microbacterial decomposition of animal and crop waste. Anaerobic digestion produces methane, which can be used directly for heating, cooking, and lighting. Adding a <b>solar</b> <b>component</b> to the digester provides a catalyst for bacteria activity, accelerating digestion and increasing biogas production. Using methane decreases the amount of energy expended by collecting and preparing firewood, eliminates hazardous health effects linked to inhalation of particles, and provides energy close to where it is needed. The purpose of this work is two fold: initial efforts focus on the development and validation of a computer-based system dynamics model that combines elements of the anaerobic digestion process in order to predict methane output; second, the model is flexed to explore how the addition of a <b>solar</b> <b>component</b> increases robustness of the design, examines predicted biogas generation as a function of varying input conditions, and determines how best to configure such systems for use in varying developing world environments. Therefore, the central components of the system: solar insolation, waste feedstock, bacteria population and consumption rates, and biogas production are related both conceptually and mathematically through a serious of equations, conversions, and a causal loop and feedback diagram. Given contextual constraints and initial assumptions for both locations, it was determined that solar insolation and subsequent digester temperature control, amount of waste, and extreme weather patterns had the most significant impact on the system as a whole. Model behavior was both reproducible and comparable to that demonstrated in existing experimental systems. This tool can thus be flexed to fit specific contexts within {{the developing}} world to improve the standard of living of many people, without significantly altering everyday activities...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{three different}} topologies of feed forward neural network (FFNN) models for generating global, direct, and diffuse hourly solar irradiance {{in the city}} of Fez (Morocco). Results from this analysis are crucial for the conception of any solar energy system. Especially, for the concentrating ones, as direct component is seldom measured. For the three models, the main input was the daily global irradiation with other radiometric and meteorological parameters. Three years of hourly data were available for this study. For each <b>solar</b> <b>component’s</b> prediction, different combinations of inputs as well as different numbers of hidden neurons were considered. To evaluate these models, the regression coefficient (R 2) and normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) were used.
