25|$|Cargill, a {{multinational}} company which controls {{the majority of}} the <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> trade in Brazil has been criticized, along with fast food chains like McDonald's, by active groups such as Greenpeace for speeding up the process of the deforestation of the Amazon. Cargill is the main supplier of soya beans to large fast food companies such as McDonald's which uses the soya products to feed their cattle and chickens. As fast food chains expand, fast food chains must increase the quantity of their livestock in order to produce more products. In order to meet the large demands of soya, Cargill is forced to expand its soya production by clear cutting parts of the Amazon.|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{evaluate}} anti-diarrhoeal {{and growth}} enhancing properties of fermented <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> in weaned piglets. Methods and Results: In a first phase piglet diet, toasted full-fat <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> (20 %) were replaced with either cooked <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> or Rhizopus microsporus or Bacillus subtilis fermented <b>soya</b> <b>beans.</b> The {{effect on the}} incidence, severity and duration of diarrhoea in enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) -challenged weaned piglets was determined (pen trial, 24 piglets per treatment). Severity of diarrhoea was significantly less on the diet with Rhizopus -fermented <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> compared with the control diet containing toasted <b>soya</b> <b>beans.</b> Piglets fed fermented <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> showed increased feed intake (13 and 12 %), average daily weight gain (18 and 21 %) and feed efficiency (3 and 8 %) (for Rhizopus and Bacillus -fermented <b>soya</b> <b>beans,</b> respectively). However, in the treatment groups an unequal mortality and a potential unequal distribution of receptor-positive piglets were observed. Conclusions: Cooked and fermented <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> could be beneficial in the control of diarrhoea in ETEC-challenged weaned piglets (particularly Rhizopus fermented) and significantly improved weight gain and feed intake (particularly Bacillus fermented). Significance and Impact of the Study: Fermented <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> could offer benefits {{with respect to the}} control of diarrhoea and feed efficiency in piglets...|$|R

2500|$|While when a {{contract}} is silent a court must essentially {{make an informed}} choice about whether a right to terminate should exist, if {{a contract}} deals with the matter the courts' general approach is to follow the parties' wishes. The drafters of the old Sale of Goods Act 1893 distinguished between [...] "conditions" [...] (major terms, which when breached confer a right to terminate) and [...] "warranties" [...] (minor terms, which do not), and under the present Sale of Goods Act 1979 some terms, such as descriptions about quality, are conditions by default. A third kind is an [...] "innominate term", which is typically a vague term like citrus pulp pellets being [...] "in good condition", or a ship having to be [...] "seaworthy". Because such a term could be breached in both a major way (e.g. the ship sinks) or a trivial way (e.g. a lifejacket is missing) the court will determine whether the right to terminate arises based on how serious in fact {{the consequences of the}} breach were. So in The Hong Kong Fir, Lord Diplock held that a ship crew being too incompetent to properly operate the vessel did not breach the contract's [...] "seaworthiness" [...] term in a serious enough way as to allow for termination, because the charterers still got a working boat and could have replaced the crew. If a contract specifies that a particular obligation is a [...] "condition" [...] the dominant approach of the courts is to treat it as such. Nevertheless, concerned with the ability of a stronger party to specify the terms it finds most convenient as [...] "conditions" [...] {{at the expense of the}} weaker, courts retain the ability to construe an agreement contra proferentum. In L Schuler AG v Wickman Machine Tool Sales Ltd the majority of the House of Lords held that clause 7 of a contract, stating it was [...] "a condition of this agreement" [...] that Mr Wickman would visit 6 major car companies [...] "at least once in every week" [...] to try selling panel presses, was not really a condition in the technical sense. So when Mr Wickman was found to have visited much less, Schuler AG could not dismiss him. This was because clause 11 said that 60 days of warning was needed before Schuler AG could terminate, so the whole contract read together meant the clause 7 had to be subject to clause 11. The language in the contract is not decisive. If the word [...] "condition" [...] is not used, but the contract describes a right to terminate, such as the contract being terminable for [...] "any breach" [...] of obligation, the issue is, again, one of construction and the courts may be reluctant to give effect to the plain meaning if it would have [...] "draconian consequences" [...] for the weaker party. By contrast, in Bunge Corporation v Tradax SA the House of Lords held that giving notice for a ship to start loading the <b>soya</b> <b>bean</b> cargo four days late, when the contract expressly stipulated the date, should allow the right to terminate regardless of the actual consequences of the breach. In mercantile contracts, 'broadly speaking time will be considered of the essence', and so it is highly likely the courts will enforce obligations to the letter.|$|E

40|$|Soya - a {{rich source}} of protein, oil and income Cue: <b>Soya</b> <b>beans</b> are best known for being rich in two {{important}} foodstuffs: oil and protein. Much of the world?s cooking oil is derived from soya, and most of this is grown in the United States, Brazil, China and Argentina. <b>Soya</b> <b>beans,</b> also called soybeans, are widely eaten as a vegetable in East Asia, where the plant originates from, but less so {{in other parts of the}} world. One reason may be that the beans need a long period of soaking and cooking to make them edible. However, because of its high protein content, soya is an excellent food, particularly for those who cannot eat meat - whether for reasons of cost or because they are vegetarian. In Malawi, <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> are used as an ingredient in phala, a nutritious porridge widely fed to babies. Mrs Linley Banda grows soya on her farm in Thyolo district, in southern Malawi. Patrick Mphaka went to visit her there, to find out more about this nutritious food and cash crop. IN:		?Yes it is easy to grow <b>soya</b> <b>beans?</b> OUT:		? I have benefited from the crop. ? DUR?N		 3 ? 20 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mrs Linley Banda from Thyolo in Malawi was talking to Patrick Mphaka. Transcript Banda	Yes it is easy to grow <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> compared to other cash crops. But it also has its own problems. The advantage of growing soya crops is that it does not require too many inputs compared to maize. The problems are that it is attacked by some pests and diseases and sometimes it is destroyed when the rains are prolonged. Mphaka	So you do not need a lot of rains for <b>soya</b> <b>beans?</b> Banda	The rains are required but not too much. Mphaka	On the two hectares on which you have planted your <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> this year, how many bags do you think you will realise from there? Banda	As you have seen, this year we did not have enough rains. I am sure I will get about sixty bags of soya from this garden because last year I had about ninety 50 kg bags of soya. Mphaka	Can we talk about money, how much is that? Banda	(Laughter) I am sure you are good at maths, you can calculate. Mphaka	Do you just harvest it and take it to the market or just harvest it and have people come and buy? How do you do it with <b>soya</b> <b>beans?</b> Banda	After harvesting the <b>soya</b> <b>beans,</b> we thresh it and winnow it. And thereafter, we check if there are some stones and some immature seed. After that we pack it in bags and it is ready for sale. Mphaka	Do you put it in different grades or do you just sell it as one grade? Banda	It is good to put it in grades so that you can fetch good price. I put in grades. Mphaka	Tell me about the market. Banda	There is a very good established market for soya. There is Rab Processors which is buying soya from us farmers. Transglobe is also buying soya from us. Other NGOs do fetch some seeds from us to give to other farmers so that they can start growing this crop. Mphaka	So why do you sell it to the local market? Banda	I sell to the local market because some farmers just come to my house to buy for their house use. So I cannot refuse to sell to them. Mphaka	What do you think is the reason that not many farmers around here are growing <b>soya</b> <b>beans,</b> when given your experience, it is a very profitable crop? Banda	The problem is that many farmers do not realize the importance of <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> and the way to process and utilize it. They feel it is difficult to grow the <b>soya</b> <b>beans.</b> Mphaka	Do you think people are used to eating soya or maybe they think that it is something which they do not know about as evidenced by their not growing it in large numbers? Banda	As of now, I can say people are now learning the goodness of eating soya. Many farmers around this area are now coming to buy the crop for their house use. Through the radio and hospitals where the under-five children are going for scales, they are told to feed their children phala (porridge) with soya. Mphaka	Given the two years that you have been growing it, are there any people who are showing interest to start to grow <b>soya</b> <b>beans?</b> Banda	Yes there are so many that this year, around this area more farmers have now started planting this crop because they have seen what I have benefited from the crop. End of track. Linley Banda grows <b>soya</b> <b>beans</b> on her farm in southern Malawi. She likes the crop because it needs less inputs than maize.
