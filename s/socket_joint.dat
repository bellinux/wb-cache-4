The vertebrae were articulated in a procoelous manner, meaning they had a concave hollow on the front end and a convex bulge on the rear; these would have fit together to produce a ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joint.</b> The secondary palate and procoelous vertebrae are advanced features also found in modern eusuchian crocodilians.|$|E

Circumduction {{is a combination of}} flexion, extension, adduction and abduction. Circumduction can be best performed at ball and socket joints, such as the hip and shoulder, but may also be performed by {{other parts of the body}} such as fingers, hands, feet, and head. For example, circumduction occurs when spinning the arm when performing a serve in tennis or bowling a cricket ball.|$|E
500|$|Each {{engine is}} {{installed}} with a gimbal bearing, a universal ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joint</b> which is {{bolted to the}} launch vehicle by its upper flange and to the engine by its lower flange. It represents the thrust interface between the engine and the launch vehicle, supporting [...] of engine weight and withstanding over [...] of thrust. As well as providing a means to attach the engine to the launch vehicle, the gimbal bearing allows the engine to be pivoted (or [...] "gimballed") around two axes of freedom {{with a range of}} ±10.5°. This motion allows the engine's thrust vector to be altered, thus steering the vehicle into the correct orientation. The bearing assembly is approximately , has a mass of , and is made of titanium alloy.|$|E

2500|$|The {{shoulder}} joint (also {{known as the}} glenohumeral joint) is the main joint of the shoulder. [...] It is a ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joint</b> that allows the arm to rotate in a circular fashion or to hinge out and up away from the body. [...] The capsule is a soft tissue envelope that encircles the glenohumeral joint and attaches to the scapula, humerus, {{and head of the}} biceps. It is lined by a thin, smooth synovial membrane. The rotator cuff is a group of four muscles that surround the {{shoulder joint}} and contribute to the shoulder's stability. The muscles of the rotator cuff are supraspinatus, subscapularis, infraspinatus, and teres minor. The cuff adheres to the glenohumeral capsule and attaches to the humeral head.|$|E
2500|$|The GG1 was [...] {{long and}} weighed [...] The {{frame of the}} {{locomotive}} was in two halves joined with a ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joint,</b> allowing the locomotive to negotiate sharper curves. The body rested on the frame and was clad in welded steel plates. The control cabs were {{near the center of}} the locomotive on each side of the main oil-cooled transformer and oil-fired train-heating boiler. This arrangement, first used on the Modified P5 class, provided for greater crew safety in a collision and for bi-directional operation of the locomotive. A pantograph on each end of the locomotive body was used to collect the 25Hz, 11,000V alternating current (AC) from the overhead lines. [...] In operation the leading pantograph was usually kept lowered and the trailing raised to collect current, since if the rear pantograph failed it would not strike the forward pantograph. Transformers between the two cabs stepped down the 11,000V to the voltages needed for the traction motors and other equipment.|$|E
50|$|Two general {{types of}} ground glass joints are fairly {{commonly}} used: joints which are slightly conically tapered and ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joints</b> (sometimes called spherical joints).|$|R
50|$|In contrast, spherical joints (or {{ball and}} <b>socket</b> <b>joints)</b> {{such as the}} hip joint permit {{rotation}} and all other directional movement, while pivot joints only permit rotation.|$|R

2500|$|The hip joint, an enarthrodial joint, can be {{described}} as a ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joint.</b> The femur connects at the acetabulum of the pelvis and projects laterally before angling medially and inferiorly to form the knee. Although this joint has three degrees of freedom, it is still stable due to the interaction of ligaments and cartilage. The labrum lines the circumference of the acetabulum to provide stability and shock absorption. Articular cartilage covers the concave area of acetabulum, providing more stability and shock absorption. [...] Surrounding the entire joint itself is a capsule secured by the tendon of the psoas muscle and three ligaments. The iliofemoral, or Y, ligament is located anteriorly and serves to prevent hip hyperextension. The pubofemoral ligament is located anteriorly just underneath the iliofemoral ligament and serves primarily to resist abduction, extension, and some external rotation. Finally the ischiofemoral ligament on the posterior side of the capsule resists extension, adduction, and internal rotation. When considering the biomechanics of hip fractures, it is important to examine the mechanical loads the hip experiences during low energy falls.|$|E
2500|$|The {{shoulder}} joint (also {{known as the}} glenohumeral joint) is the main joint of the shoulder. It is a ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joint</b> that allows the arm to rotate in a circular fashion or to hinge out and up away from the body. [...] It is formed by the articulation between {{the head of the}} humerus and the lateral scapula (specifically-the glenoid cavity of the scapula). [...] The [...] "ball" [...] of the joint is the rounded, medial anterior surface of the humerus and the [...] "socket" [...] is formed by the glenoid cavity, the dish-shaped portion of the lateral scapula. [...] The shallowness of the cavity and relatively loose connections between the shoulder {{and the rest of the}} body allows the arm to have tremendous mobility, at the expense of being much easier to dislocate than most other joints in the body. There is an approximately 4-to-1 disproportion in size between the large head of the humerus and the shallow glenoid cavity.The glenoid cavity is made deeper by the addition of the fibrocartilaginous ring of the glenoid labrum.|$|E
2500|$|X-ray projectional {{radiography}} cannot directly reveal {{tears of}} the rotator cuff, a 'soft tissue', and consequently, normal X-rays cannot exclude a damaged cuff. However, indirect evidence of pathology {{may be seen}} in instances where {{one or more of the}} tendons have undergone degenerative calcification (calcific tendinitis). The humeral head may migrate upwards (high-riding humeral head) secondary to tears of the infraspinatus, or combined tears of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. Prolonged contact between a high-riding humeral head and the acromion above it, may lead to X-rays findings of wear on the humeral head and acromion and secondary degenerative arthritis of the glenohumeral joint (the ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joint</b> of the shoulder), called cuff arthropathy, may follow. Incidental X-ray [...] findings of bone spurs at the adjacent acromioclavicular joint may show a bone spur growing from the outer edge of the clavicle downwards towards the rotator cuff. Spurs may also be seen on the underside of the acromion, once thought to cause direct fraying of the rotator cuff from contact friction, a concept currently regarded as controversial.|$|E
50|$|Spigot and sockets {{involve a}} normal pipe end, the spigot, being {{inserted}} into the socket or bell of another pipe or fitting with a seal being made between the two within the socket. Normal spigot and <b>socket</b> <b>joints</b> do not allow direct metal to metal contact with all forces being transmitted through the elastomeric seal. They can consequently flex and allow some degree of rotation, allowing pipes to shift and relieve stresses imposed by soil movement. The corollary is that unrestrained spigot and <b>socket</b> <b>joints</b> transmit essentially no compression or tension along the axis of the pipe and little shear. Any bends, tees or valves therefore require either a restrained joint or, more commonly, thrust blocks, which transmit the forces as compression into the surrounding soil.|$|R
50|$|The {{steam pipes}} were routed {{across the front}} tube-plates into {{fittings}} which formed a prolongation of the bottom part of the smokeboxes. From there, steam passed through a swivelling and sliding joint to the cylinders. The exhaust pipes back to the smokeboxes were equipped with ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joints.</b>|$|R
5|$|Because {{titanium}} is biocompatible (non-toxic and not {{rejected by}} the body), it has many medical uses, including surgical implements and implants, such as hip balls and <b>sockets</b> (<b>joint</b> replacement) and dental implants that can stay in place for up to 20 years. The titanium is often alloyed with about 4% aluminium or 6% Al and 4% vanadium.|$|R
2500|$|The {{articular}} interface is {{not part}} of either implant, rather it is the area between the acetabular cup and femoral component. The articular interface of the hip is a simple ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joint.</b> Size, material properties and machining tolerances at the articular interface can be selected based on patient demand to optimise implant function and longevity whilst mitigating associated risks. The interface size is measured by the outside diameter of the head or the inside diameter of the socket. Common sizes of femoral heads are , [...] and [...] While [...] was common in the first modern prostheses, now even larger sizes are available from 38 to over 54mm. Larger-diameter heads lead to increased stability and range of motion whilst lowering the risk of dislocation. At the same time they are also subject to higher stresses such as friction and inertia. Different combinations of materials have different physical properties which can be coupled {{to reduce the amount of}} wear debris generated by friction. Typical pairings of materials include metal on polyethylene (MOP), metal on crosslinked polyethylene (MOXP), ceramic on ceramic (COC), ceramic on crosslinked polyethylene (COXP) and metal on metal (MOM). Each combination has different advantages and disadvantages.|$|E
2500|$|The ECoG {{recording}} {{is performed}} from electrodes {{placed on the}} exposed cortex. [...] In order to access the cortex, a surgeon must first perform a craniotomy, removing {{a part of the}} skull to expose the brain surface. [...] This procedure may be performed either under general anesthesia or under local anesthesia if patient interaction is required for functional cortical mapping. [...] Electrodes are then surgically implanted {{on the surface of the}} cortex, with placement guided by the results of preoperative EEG and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). [...] Electrodes may either be placed outside the dura mater (epidural) or under the dura mater (subdural). [...] ECoG electrode arrays typically consist of sixteen sterile, disposable stainless steel, carbon tip, platinum, Platinum-iridium alloy or gold ball electrodes, each mounted on a ball and <b>socket</b> <b>joint</b> for ease in positioning. [...] These electrodes are attached to an overlying frame in a “crown” or “halo” configuration. Subdural strip and grid electrodes are also widely used in various dimensions, having anywhere from 4 to 256 electrode contacts. [...] The grids are transparent, flexible, and numbered at each electrode contact. [...] Standard spacing between grid electrodes is 1cm; individual electrodes are typically 5mm in diameter. [...] The electrodes sit lightly on the cortical surface, and are designed with enough flexibility to ensure that normal movements of the brain do not cause injury. [...] A key advantage of strip and grid electrode arrays is that they may be slid underneath the dura mater into cortical regions not exposed by the craniotomy. [...] Strip electrodes and crown arrays may be used in any combination desired. [...] Depth electrodes may also be used to record activity from deeper structures such as the hippocampus.|$|E
60|$|The tumbler {{was secured}} {{in a more}} curious manner still. It {{was placed in a}} brass ring, which {{projected}} from the wall in a corner over the wash stand, and which was made just large enough to receive it. The soap dish and the brush tray were also placed in sockets cut to receive them in the marble slab, which formed {{the upper part of the}} wash stand. The looking glass was round, and was screwed to the wall by means of a stem and a ball or <b>socket</b> <b>joint,</b> in such a manner that it could be set in any position required, according to the height of the observer, and yet it could not by any possibility fall from its place. There were very few pegs or pins for hanging clothes upon, because, when clothes are thus hung, they are found to swing back and forth whenever the ship is rolling in a heavy sea, in a manner that is very tiresome and disagreeable for sick passengers to see. Nor were there many shelves about the state room; for if there had been, the passengers would be likely to put various articles upon them when the sea was smooth; and then, when the ship came to pitch and roll in gales of wind, the things would all slide off upon the floor. So instead of shelves there were pockets made of canvas or duck, several together, one above another. These pockets formed very convenient receptacles for such loose articles as the passengers might have in their state rooms, and were, of course, perfectly secure.|$|E
