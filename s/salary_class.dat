40|$|Abstract — In {{knowledge}} based industry, compensation planning {{is a key}} strategic area for growth and success. In order to retain high performance employees, optimum salary offer is essential. Determining such salary figures, based on various information about a current employee or a prospective employee, is a challenge that corporations face very frequently. Although HR managers typically tackle such salary prediction and negotiation issues in consultation with relevant department-level managers, any automated system with such capability would be of great help for them. Given the attributes of an employee (current or prospective), which includes her demographic profile along with other information such as qualification, performance level etc., several well-known classification algorithms {{can be used for}} the prediction of the <b>salary</b> <b>class.</b> But unfortunately, such details of employee data of any corporation are generally not available in public for performance evaluation of classification algorithms. In this paper, this limitation is overcome to some extent by using a public database (UCI census dataset) which have most of the attributes available for a segment of population for salary prediction. Although the data used in this experimental paper is not directly related to salary prediction of employees within an organization, but it can be extrapolated {{to be used in the}} former scenario as the tuples in UCI census dataset include employer type as an attribute. This analysis found that among five classification algorithms, decision tree and Bayesian belief network performs better than other three algorithms, namely, naïve Bayes, support vector machine and neural network. The software used for running these algorithms is WEKA which is a well-known university tool for machine learning...|$|E

40|$|Post-apartheid South Africa {{has faced}} {{numerous}} new challenges. Amongst these challenges is public sector corruption, which is pervasive and of major {{concern in the}} local sphere of government. The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore what the understanding of corruption is among local government officials in the Dr Kenneth Kaunda District Municipality. An investigation through interviews was conducted to gather the understanding of corruption by the officials. One of the major findings of the research was that corruption was generally comprehended as non-adherence and non-compliance to the set standards, procedures, policies and Acts passed to govern local government from National Government. Furthermore, local government officials were aware of anti-corruption policies but opted for non-compliance and non-adherence. It was also established that small <b>salaries,</b> social <b>class</b> competition and greed were amongst the motivating factors to corruption and that the main barrier to reporting corruption was fear of victimization at the workplace...|$|R

Graduates of the normal school program received lifetime teaching certification statewide. The 1910 Oklahoma Legislature funded faculty salaries and the construction of a building on a 16 acre site donated by a Chickasaw allottee.

40|$|Low teacher {{motivation}} and its detrimental effect {{on student achievement}} are central problems of many education systems in Africa. Using standardized data for student achievement in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, C 4 te d`Ivoire, Madagascar and Senegal, this paper analyzes the empirical links between various policy measures, teacher job satisfaction and primary education outcomes. It appears {{that there is only}} very limited evidence for the effectiveness of intensively debated and costly measures such as increasing teachers <b>salaries,</b> reducing <b>class</b> size, and increasing academic qualification requirements. Other, more simple measures such as improved equipment with textbooks are both more effective and less costly. It also appears that teacher job satisfaction and education quality are not necessarily complementary objectives. Especially those measures ensuring control and incentive related working conditions for teachers, significantly increase student achievement while reducing teacher job satisfaction. In addition, teachers` academic qualification beyond the "baccalaur 9 at", while beneficial for students` learning, tends to lead to a mismatch between teachers` expectations and professional realities, and thereby reduces teachers` job satisfaction...|$|R

Writing in Forbes, Michael Horn wrote that the report {{does not take into account}} the extensive after-school tutoring that most public-school students receive in South Korea, which ranked second on the list after Finland. In the BBC News review of the report, it noted that [...] "The study highlights that smaller class sizes or teachers' pay are not necessarily linked to better results", yet conversely [...] "Underpaying teachers can also be seen as 'inefficient' because it is a barrier to recruiting good quality staff - with low pay contributing to Brazil and Indonesia's poor performance in these rankings." ...|$|R
