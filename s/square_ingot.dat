40|$|Improvements in ID saws {{leading to}} lower costs for {{producing}} silicon wafers for solar cells are described. The relationships between crystal size and blade size {{and between the}} length of time it takes to slice a wafer and wafer thickness are discussed. The influence of ingot production methods on wafering performance is considered. A cost sensitivity analysis of slicing a 10 cm <b>square</b> <b>ingot</b> and economic analyses of slicing a four inch and a six inch ingot are presented. A wafering cost model based on the IPEG 2 is given...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of panel crack formation in steel ingots has been undertaken to improve under-standing of the {{mechanisms by which}} the cracks develop and to evaluate possible solutiQns to this problem that has plagued the steel industry intermittently for decades. The investigation features the application of two-dimensional, finite-element, heat-flow, and stress models, which have been de-scribed in earlier publications I~' 2) for steel ingot processing. The model predictions have clarified the role of stress generation i panel crack formation and demonstrate he importance of the ", / ~ a phase transformation. It has been revealed that two distinct ypes of panel cracks, {{both of which are}} partly caused by intermediate-temperature embritttement of steel involving aluminum nitride precipi-tation, operate under different mechanisms. Mid-face panel cracks, which are analyzed in Part I of this paper, apparently form during air cooling when the mid-face surface is between the Arl and 500 ~ The cracks can be prevented by ensuring the ingot surface does not cool below the Arl, and preferably the Ar 3 temperature. In case of a 335 mm <b>square</b> <b>ingot,</b> this would require reheating and rolling within the first hour after being stripped from the mold. Alternatively charging the ingots to a holding furnace to slow the surface cooling rate through the critical Ar ~- 500 ~ temperature zone should be beneficial. Off-corner panel cracks are discussed in Part II. I...|$|E
50|$|In {{open die}} forging a {{cylindrical}} billet is subjected to upsetting between a pair of flat dies or platens. Under frictionless homogeneous deformation, {{the height of the}} cylinder is reduced and its diameter is increased. Forging of shafts, disks, rings etc. are performed using {{open die forging}} technique. <b>Square</b> cast <b>ingots</b> are converted into round shape by this process.Open die forging is classified into three main types, namely, cogging, fullering and edging.|$|R
40|$|In {{the area}} of ingot casting the proof of concept of heat {{exchanger}} method (HEM) was established. It was also established that HEM cast silicon yielded solar cell performance comparable to Czochralski grown material. Solar cells with conversion efficiencies of up to 15 % were fabricated. It was shown that <b>square</b> cross-section <b>ingots</b> can be cast. In {{the area of}} crystal slicing, it was established that silicon can be sliced efficiently with the fixed abrasive slicing technique approach. This concept was carried forward to 10 cm diameter workpiece...|$|R
40|$|International audienceGrain {{orientation}} in multi-crystalline photovoltaic silicon is analyzed {{in the case}} of a <b>square</b> shaped <b>ingot</b> produced by cold crucible continuous casting (4 C). This technique leads to a specific grain structure: horizontal on the wall where nucleation occurs and vertical at the center of the ingot. EBSD analysis along a solidification path shows that successive Sigma 3 twinning is the predominant source of variation in grain orientation. In fact, depending on the location along the solidification path, only 15 - 35 % of grain boundaries are random boundaries without Sigma 3 (n) twinning relationship (1 <= n <= 5) and 34 - 48 % are Sigma 3 twins. The grain orientation distribution is similar at the beginning and end of solidification, and the number of low angle grain boundaries is negligible. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserve...|$|R
40|$|Large-scale {{production}} of multi-crystalline silicon for high-efficient solar cells {{is a very}} important task of todayâ€™s photovoltaic technology. The efficiency of crystalline silicon solar cells depends on both the crystallization process and the solar cell processing sequence. As far as the crystallization process is concerned, {{it is very important to}} know the temperature distribution during the solidification of silicon ingots, to predict the solidification structure obtained and thus the materials properties. In this study the transient 2 D and stationary 3 D numerical simulation of the solidification process of large <b>square</b> mc-Si <b>ingots</b> is investigated, by using the software FIDAP and FluentTM. Some geometrical approximations of the real furnace and specific approaches for the radiation modelling are used in order to solve the difficulties related to numerical analysis. The results are compared to the experimental data, in order to calibrate the numerical model...|$|R
