5|$|A {{number of}} gaseous or highly {{volatile}} brominated halomethane compounds are non-toxic and make superior fire <b>suppressant</b> agents by this same mechanism, and are particular effective in enclosed spaces such as submarines, airplanes, and spacecraft. However, they are expensive and their production and use {{has been greatly}} curtailed due to their effect as ozone-depleting agents. They are no longer used in routine fire extinguishers, but retain niche uses in aerospace and military automatic fire-suppression applications. They include bromochloromethane (Halon 1011, CH2BrCl), bromochlorodifluoromethane (Halon 1211, CBrClF2), and bromotrifluoromethane (Halon 1301, CBrF3).|$|E
5|$|Solar {{evaporation}} ponds at {{the edges}} of the lake produce salts and brine (water with high salt quantity). Minerals extracted from the lake include: sodium chloride (common salt), used in water softeners, salt lick blocks for livestock, and to melt ice on local roadways (food-grade salt is not produced from the lake, as it would require further costly processing to ensure its purity); potassium sulfate, used as a commercial fertilizer; and magnesium-chloride brine, used in the production of magnesium metal, chlorine gas, and as a dust <b>suppressant.</b> US Magnesium operates a plant on the southwest shore of the lake, which produces 14 percent of the worldwide supply of magnesium, more than any other North American magnesium operation. Mineral-extraction companies operating on the lake pay royalties on their products to the State of Utah, which owns the lake.|$|E
40|$|The hydrologic {{changes in}} {{surfaces}} treated with dust <b>suppressants</b> is investigated in this study. Dust <b>suppressants</b> {{were applied to}} disturbed land surfaces which are {{a major source of}} fine particulate matter in the air. The application of dust <b>suppressants</b> affects the runoff characteristics of these lands as well as the water quality of the runoff. In this paper, the hydrologic changes are evaluated by using a rainfall simulator and performing field experiments on plots treated with dust <b>suppressants.</b> The rainfall simulation system is able to provide a uniform distribution over rainfall over a 2. 4 meter x 2. 4 meter plot. Results of the study indicate that the majority of dust <b>suppressants</b> create a surface that is less permeable compared to the natural surface. This leads to higher runoff volumes. The largest increase in runoff was fives times higher than the control plot. The runoff volume, timing of initial runoff, and rate of runoff varied for most plots; however, the majority of the plots had runoff that occurred earlier in the experiment than compared to the control plot. The results {{of this study indicate that}} treating surfaces with dust <b>suppressants</b> could create larger downstream channels in urban areas...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{there has been}} an {{increased}} use of chemical dust <b>suppressants</b> such as water, salts, asphalt emulsion, vegetable oils, molasses, synthetic polymers, mulches, and lignin products. Dust <b>suppressants</b> abate dust by changing the physical properties of the soil surface and are typically used on construction sites, unpaved roads, and mining activities. The use of chemical dust <b>suppressants</b> has increased dramatically due to rapid population growth and increased emphasis on the need to control particulates in the interest of air quality. In the United States, there are over 2, 500, 000 km of public unpaved roads, of which 25 % (625, 000 km) are treated with chemical dust <b>suppressants.</b> A critical problem in the arid southwestern U. S. is dust suppression on land disturbed for residential construction. Recognizing {{that it is important to}} achieve and maintain clean air, the concern that prompted this report is that application of dust <b>suppressants</b> to improve air quality could potentially have other adverse environmental impacts. Times Beach, Missouri is a classic example where the resolution of dust emissions from unpaved roads leads to the creation of a Superfund site. In 1972 and 1973 waste oil contaminated dioxin was sprayed on unpaved roads and vacant lots for dust control in Times Beach. After realizing the adverse situation that had occurred, the costs to relocate the residents and clean up the site was over $ 80 million. Much more stringent regulations are now in place to avoid another Times Beach; however, there is still concern over the use of dust <b>suppressants</b> since most products used as dust <b>suppressants</b> are by-products and their exact composition is unknown. The purpose of this report is to summarize the current state of knowledge on the potential environmental impacts of chemical dust <b>suppressants.</b> Furthermore, the report summarizes the views of an Expert Panel that was convened on May 30 - 31, 2002 at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas to probe into the potential environmental issues associated with the use of dust <b>suppressants...</b>|$|R

25|$|There is also {{a marked}} {{difference}} between dextromethorphan hydrobromide, contained in most cough <b>suppressant</b> preparations, and dextromethorphan polistirex, contained in the brand name preparation Delsym. Polistirex is a polymer that is bonded to the dextromethorphan that requires more time for the stomach to digest it as it requires that an ion exchange reaction take place prior to its dissolution into the blood. Because of this, dextromethorphan polistirex takes considerably longer to absorb, resulting in more gradual and longer lasting effects reminiscent of time release pills. As a cough <b>suppressant,</b> the polistirex version lasts up to 12 hours. This duration also holds true when used recreationally.|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of field experiments on the potential water quality impacts from the application of dust <b>suppressants</b> to disturbed lands in Clark County, Nevada. This is an important issue not only in the southwest, but in all of the U. S. since there are currently minimal guidelines for the use of dust <b>suppressants.</b> The use of dust <b>suppressants</b> is driven by the need of communities to comply with air quality standards of PM- 10 (particulate matter less than 10 μm in diameter) emissions. There is, however, concern that the solution of this air pollution problem will have other unanticipated environmental and human health consequences. Dust <b>suppressants</b> include water, fiber mulches, water-absorbing materials (e. g., calcium chloride, magnesium chloride), petroleum based organics (e. g., asphalt emulsion), non-petroleum based organics (e. g., vegetable oil, molasses), synthetic polymer emulsions, and lignin products. These materials are generally effective in minimizing dust; however, {{little is known about the}} effects of the products on the environment and human health. In Clark County, there is the potential for dust <b>suppressants</b> to be used on large areas to minimize the PM- 10 emissions from lands that are disturbed from construction activities and on unpaved roads. Furthermore, all of the Las Vegas Valley drains to Lake Mead which is a drinking water source for many communities in the southwest. It is undesirable to allow the application of dust <b>suppressants</b> that could potentially contribute contaminated runoff to Lake Mead. The agencies sponsoring this research (Clark County Health District, Clark County Air Quality Management Agency, Las Vegas Valley Water District, Southern Nevada Water Authority, Clark County Flood Control District, and the City of Las Vegas) recognize that research on all the potential environmental impacts is important; however, impacts of dust <b>suppressants</b> on water quality were given the highest priority for this study. Therefore, the overall objective of this research was to generate basic data for evaluating the water quality impacts of major categories of dust <b>suppressants.</b> This information will serve as a scientific basis for proposed guidelines on the application of dust <b>suppressants</b> to disturbed lands...|$|R

25|$|Condensed aerosol fire {{suppression}} is a particle-based form of fire extinction similar to gaseous {{fire suppression}} or dry chemical fire extinction.
