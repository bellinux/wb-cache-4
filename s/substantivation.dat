5000|$|Regalia is Latin plurale tantum for the {{privileges}} and the insignia {{characteristic of a}} sovereign. The word stems from the Latin <b>substantivation</b> of the adjective regalis, [...] "regal", itself from rex, [...] "king". It is sometimes used in the singular, regale.|$|E
40|$|Claude Buridant : The <b>substantivation</b> ofthe infmitive in Old French. In {{the first}} part ofthe article the infmitive is {{characterized}} in the whole verbal system and the generai theoretical parameters of this <b>substantivation</b> are brought out. Afterthis restatement the study {{is devoted to the}} <b>substantivation</b> of this mood and his fundamental characteristics in Old French, that is the possibility to have a complementation. A distinction is made between essential and accidentai substantivated infinitives. The first are characterized by morphological, syntactical and semantical criteria and seem restricted to fundamental zones of the human activities. The second, facultative, can have the characterization and complementation ofthe substantive and ofthe verb at one and the same time. They often are favoured by some conditions (use of the preposition de, verbal constructions, use of sanz point de) and express ail the functions of a noun. They often occurs as a synthetical form of thematization (condensed anaphoric recapitulation or cataphoric thematization) and as a preferential process of abstraction in the courtly and allegorie style ofthe 1 3 th century. These possibilities and the range of these uses are more and more limited in the evolution, where French diverges in his typology ofthe other romance languages, and specially on and after the classical period, but the <b>substantivation</b> ofthe infmitive rises again actually - without complementation - in usingthe resources always available ofthe mood.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I present a {{conceptual}} analysis of adjectival subordination. It {{is argued that}} adjectival subordination conveys the conceptual operation of eventive characterization of individuals. This operation consists in using an event to characterize an individual; it is claimed that many syntactic properties of adjectival subordination in the world's languages follow from this conceptual operation, and that a full explanation of the typology {{of this type of}} subordination can only be produced in a semantic framework. It is also shown how adjectival subordination interacts with other syntactic processes such as incorporation, verbal adjectivization and <b>substantivation,</b> elision, anaphora and how these interactions can be accounted for in the conceptual framework sketched in this paper. The examples illustrating the main points are drawn from Georgian, Chukchi, Hungarian, Basque and Spanish, since the investigation is typologically oriented...|$|E
40|$|Conceptually, the labelization {{in medical}} language, is the {{classification}} or {{the identification of}} a patient by his symptoms or disease, {{as if they were}} classificatory properties. In the medical field, it is assumed to be frequent. It {{is the result of a}} linguistic phenomenon: the adjectival nominalization. In Spanish, the later is ruled by semantic properties which explain why the occurrencies of that kind of Nominal Group without Noun are so recurrent in this field. Indeed medical adjectives are supposed to be adapted to this semantic marking. La labellisation dans le registre médical, est la classification et l'identification d'un patient par son symptôme ou sa pathologie, est particulièrement fréquente. Elle est bien souvent le résultat d'un phénomène linguistique : la <b>substantivation</b> adjectivale. En espagnol, celle-ci est régie par des propriétés sémantiques qui permettent d'expliquer pourquoi les occurrences de ce type de GN sans N sont si récurrentes dans ce milieu. Les adjectifs médicaux se prêtent particulièrement à ce type de marquage sémantique...|$|E
40|$|Giving a high {{appraisal}} to {{the handbook}} by T. V. Shmeleva, the reviewer considers it a fullfledged monograph covering {{almost all the}} branches of onomastics including those which have not attracted much attention from scholars until recently. The book is based upon rich linguistic, cultural and historical materials which help the author explain the regularities {{of the emergence of}} proper names. T. V. Shmeleva provides a deep analysis of the three elements of the Russian anthroponymic formula: given name, patronymic and family name. The chapter devoted to zoonyms shows, in an accessible and convincing form, the origin of animal names, the ways of their formation including morphemic techniques, transposition, and <b>substantivation</b> of adjectives, etc. The reviewer points to the accuracy of the research of different types of proper names (hydronyms, chrononyms, oronyms) and the innovative character of {{the last part of the}} book which focuses on the onomastic space of a modern city (notably, on urbanonyms), with this branch of onomastics having undergone important transfomations in recent years. The author’s sincere interest in proper names encourages readers to do deeper research of the issues of onomastics...|$|E
40|$|Speakers {{are moving}} cognizers {{who engage in}} bodily acts of conceptualization. The “globe gesture” {{is among the most}} {{spectacular}} forms of “manual thinking” (Streeck 2009) used in formal talk. A characterization of the kinesic action typical of the “globe gesture” is first provided that shows how “the image of a bounded, supportable object” is created (McNeill 1992) and set up in gesture space. As conceptual objects are created and masses of semantic substance fashioned, visible shape is given to shapeless mental representations. A powerful semiotic trick is performed with a simple cognitive artifact. Interestingly, a willing suspension of disbelief is required of speakers and listeners who must temporarily give up their rational conceptions of visibility, materiality and palpability to watch the symbolic manipulation of invisible objects. The basic expressive properties of the “globe gesture” are next characterized: outlining and isolating objects of conception; neutralizing semantic specification; establishing a joint focus of attention and imagination; shaping, displaying and unifying content; creating a sense of reality and existence through physical presence. Iconic modifications of the standard metaphoric hand configuration, virtuosic elaborations and creative blends are finally examined before reporting the results of an experimental study of the globe gesture’s heuristic properties in a controlled environment. 14 students attending a multimodal “kineflective” seminar used the hand configuration to engage in “choreographic thinking” (Forsythe 2009) and develop a haptic understanding of derivation, nominalization, <b>substantivation,</b> conceptual reification. The globe gesture acted as a facilitator so long as a high degree of generality was maintained but was promptly discarded when words with a strong emotional appeal were introduced (e. g. sadness, madness). Emblems and iconic gestures were spontaneously performed instead...|$|E
40|$|NOTRE PROJET EST DE PROPOSER UNE TYPOLOGIE SEMANTICO-REFERENTIELLE DES ADJECTIFS SUBSTANTIVES (AS) EN ANGLAIS CONTEMPORAIN. NOTRE POINT DE DEPART EST LA CONSCIENCE QUE LA <b>SUBSTANTIVATION</b> EST UN PHENOMENE DE RESTRUCTURATION ET DE CONDENSATION SYNTAXIQUE, ABOUTISSANT PARFOIS A UNE LEXICALISATION. NOTRE DEMARCHE A ETE DE MENER UNE ETUDE DE CORPUS EN CONTEXTE: UNE ANALYSE MORPHOSYNTAXIQUE DES PHENOMENES DE SURFACE DE L'ENONCE, C'EST-A-DIRE LA COMPOSITION DU SYNTAGME CONTENANT L'AS (DETERMINANTS, MODIFIEURS, COMPLEMENTS, ETC.) A LAQUELLE S'EST AJOUTEE UNE ANALYSE SEMANTIQUE S'INTERESSANT AU MODE DE RESTITUTION DE LA REFERENCE DES AS. NOUS AVONS MIS EN EVIDENCE LE PARCOURS INTERPRETATIF DECLENCHE PAR L'EMPLOI DES AS, ET OBSERVE LE ROLE DE LA FLEXION DU PLURIEL DANS LA DENSIFICATION DU SENS. L'ASSOCIATION DES DEUX NIVEAUX D'ANALYSE NOUS PERMET DE PROPOSER UN MODELE GLOBAL DES ADJECTIFS SUBSTANTIVES EN TERMES DE MODES DE CATEGORISATION DU REEL. LA RICHESSE SEMANTIQUE DES AS, L'EXPRESSIVITE ET LA CREATIITE QUI S'EN DEGAGENT EN FONT UN OBJET D'ETUDE MULTIDISCIPLINAIRE. THE PURPOSE OF OUR STUDY IS TO OFFER A TYPOLOGY OF SUBSTANTIVIZED ADJECTIVES IN CONTEMPORARY ENGLISH. OUR APPROACH IS BOTH A MORPHOSYNTACTIC AND A SEMANTIC ONE. IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH IN THIS FIELD, WE HAVE COMPILED THE VARIOUS APPROACHES TO THE ABSENCE OF A HEAD-NOUN IN A NOUN PHRASE, INCLUDING FUSION, ELLIPSIS AND SUBSTANTIVIZATION AND HAVE CONCLUDED THAT SUBSTANTIVIZATION IS ABOVE ALL A SYNTACTIC PHENOMENON WITH SEMANTIC REPERCUSSIONS IN TERMS OF CATEGORIZATION AND THE REPRSENTATION OF EXPERIENCES. THE LEXICAL APPROACH OF SUBSTANTIVIZED ADJECTIVES IS MERELY THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. OUR IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS HAS ENABLED US TO DETAIL THEIR MULTIPLE MEANING, THEIR EXPRESSIVE AND CREATIVE COMPONENTS, GIVING US A BASIS FOR A PROGRESSIVE TYPOLOGY OF SUBSTANTIVIZED ADJECTIVES IN TERMS OF THE AUTONOMY OF THE CATEGORIZATION.
