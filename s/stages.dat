5|$|Additionally, {{there was}} a points classification. Riders won points for {{finishing}} in the top 15 on each stage. Flat <b>stages</b> award more points that mountainous <b>stages,</b> meaning that this classification tends to favour sprinters. In addition, points can be won in intermediate sprints.

50|$|In the United States, <b>Stage</b> Manager is {{a generic}} title {{that may be}} applied to anyone who {{performs}} <b>stage</b> management functions. On small shows, one person typically performs all the tasks of <b>stage</b> management, and is simply {{referred to as the}} <b>stage</b> manager. Larger shows often need two or more <b>stage</b> managers. In such cases the head <b>stage</b> manager is titled Production <b>Stage</b> Manager (commonly abbreviated PSM), and working under the PSM is one or more Assistant <b>Stage</b> Managers (commonly abbreviated ASM). Shows that employ three <b>stage</b> managers have a PSM and two ASMs, though the program credits may list them as Production <b>Stage</b> Manager (first or head <b>stage</b> manager), <b>Stage</b> Manager (second <b>stage</b> manager), and Assistant <b>Stage</b> Manager (third <b>stage</b> manager).|$|R
50|$|The Pre-Pastonian <b>Stage</b> or Baventian <b>Stage</b> (from Easton Bavents in Suffolk), is {{the name}} for an early Pleistocene <b>stage</b> used in the British Isles. It precedes the Pastonian <b>Stage</b> and follows the Bramertonian <b>Stage.</b> This <b>stage</b> ended 1.806 Ma (million years ago) {{at the end of}} Marine Isotope <b>Stage</b> 65. It is not {{currently}} known when this <b>stage</b> started. The Pre-Pastonian <b>Stage</b> is equivalent to the Tiglian C4c <b>Stage</b> of Europe and the Pre-Illinoian J glaciation of the early Pre-Illinoian <b>Stage</b> of North America.|$|R
5|$|Baker created four {{distinct}} <b>stages</b> {{of makeup}} design so that West {{would appear to}} melt gradually as time passed. However, after the film went through two separate <b>stages</b> of editing, these makeup <b>stages</b> were ultimately eliminated from the final cut, and the character looks generally the same throughout the film. Richard Meyers, author of The World of Fantasy Films, said actor Rebar was impatient and uncooperative with the extensive makeup sessions required for the effects, and thus did not wear all of the facial appliances Baker designed. This, Meyers said, {{might have been an}} additional factor in the lack of makeup effect <b>stages</b> in the final film. The version of the film shot by Sachs had not included any scenes with West before he sustained the radiation poisoning that caused his body to melt. Such scenes were, however, re-shot later by the producers without Sachs' participation.|$|E
5|$|Brawl allows {{players to}} create their own <b>stages</b> using several options in a mode called Stage Builder.

5|$|Dr. Wily's Revenge reuses and mixes stage components, enemies, and robot masters {{from the}} first two NES games in the Mega Man series.

A password system allows the player {{to return to the}} game after any or all of these first four <b>stages</b> are cleared or when the player suffers a game over. Once the player completes these <b>stages</b> and travels through Wily's fortress, four more robot masters must be fought in order to progress. These bosses (Quick Man, Bubble Man, Flash Man, and Heat Man) are taken from Mega Man 2 for NES. Although they do not have their own <b>stages,</b> the player earns the special weapons of these bosses. Once all four are defeated, the player faces a new robot master created for the game, Enker.|$|E

As a result, Bradley Wiggins assumed the maillot jaune, becoming the first British rider to wear the jersey since 2000. Wiggins maintained the lead for the following three <b>stages,</b> including his first victory at the Tour during the ninth stage individual time trial in Besançon.
