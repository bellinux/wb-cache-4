5|$|The player character's {{proficiency}} with a <b>skill</b> {{is increased}} by practice, training, and study. Practice involves performing the specific actions {{associated with a}} given <b>skill,</b> which gradually raises the character's proficiency in that <b>skill.</b> Raising weapon skills requires striking an enemy with the appropriate weapon; raising armor skills requires being struck while wearing the appropriate type of armor; etc. Training involves paying cash to non-player characters (NPCs) in exchange for immediate proficiency increases in that <b>skill.</b> Study requires reading books found in the game, some of which will immediately raise a <b>skill</b> when read. Weaponry skills affect the character's chance to hit. Armor skills affect the defensive strength of the armor. Other skills affect proficiency at other actions such as potion-making, running, lockpicking, etc.|$|E

5|$|As the {{character}} progresses through the game, experience points (XP) are earned from accomplishing various actions, such as completing a quest, killing an enemy, and so forth, {{with a new}} level granted upon reaching the necessary amount of XP. A new level grants the player the ability to allocate points to the various Skills available and thus improve upon them, making them more effective; for instance, a higher lock-picking <b>skill</b> allows the player {{to be able to}} tackle more difficult locks on doors and containers, while a higher medicine <b>skill</b> increases the amount of health recovered with Stimpaks. Once {{the character}} achieves their second level, they can be granted a Perk, which offers advantages of varying quality and form, such as being able to carry more items, finding more ammo in containers, and having a higher chance to perform a critical hit. Many Perks have a set of prerequisites that need to be satisfied, often requiring a certain <b>Skill</b> level to acquire them, while a new Perk can be granted for every two levels earned by the character. Additional improvements to <b>Skill</b> levels can be made by finding <b>Skill</b> books, which confer a permanent boost to levels, while players can also search for and find a series of around 20 bobbleheads that also confer a bonus to these and also primary attributes.|$|E

5|$|Three {{hypotheses}} might {{account for}} consistent foraging specializations across individuals: food source variation, phenotypic differences, and frequency dependent-choice. The food source variation hypothesis predicts that individuals will specialize when the use of two skills is more costly than specialist foraging. The phenotypic differences hypothesis proposes that individuals differ {{in their ability to}} use each foraging <b>skill</b> and stably specialize on the most profitable one. The pattern of specialization is expected to be stable although the number of individuals that use a given <b>skill</b> depends on the phenotypic composition of the flock. The frequency dependent choice hypothesis also proposes that individuals specialize on the most profitable <b>skill,</b> but the profitability of each alternative decreases as the number of phenotypically identical foragers gradually specialize on each <b>skill</b> when initially given two equally profitable alternatives. At equilibrium, individual payoffs should be independent of the pattern of specialization. Individuals in flocks adjusted their use of the two skills and two birds in each flock specialized on a different <b>skill</b> resulting in a variant of both the food source variation hypothesis and frequency dependent choice hypothesis.|$|E
