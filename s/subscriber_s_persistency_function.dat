40|$|The {{performance}} evaluation of communication protocols in broadband {{fixed wireless access}} (BFWA) networks needs the accurate description of the statistical properties of the packet error process. In BFWA networks mainly operating above 20 GHz, a clear line-of-sight (LOS) path is necessary between the base stations (BS) and the <b>subscribers</b> (<b>S).</b> Rain attenuation is the dominant fading mechanism at these frequencies. In this paper, a Markovbased method to estimate the packet loss rate (PLR) performance over a dynamically, due to propagation, varying LOS BFWA channel is presented and tested against simulation results. The proposed method {{is based on the}} firstorder Markovian modeling of the rain attenuation process. The proposed method can serve as a {{performance evaluation}} tool of various modulation and coding schemes (MCS) and is also applicable even when adaptive fade mitigation techniques are employed in the BFWA network. © 2007 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|Our {{modified}} version of T-CLAP snowballs from a random adopter with depth d (three, {{in the case of}} our paper) and keeps pruning subscribers from this sample while the resulting community has more than <b>s</b> <b>subscribers</b> (115, in the case of our paper). H is the social network graph. H. S is the set of subscribers in this graph and A the set of adopters. The algorithm identifies the subscribers in H that are not adopters with the lowest IER. These subscribers are kept in set V. If V is empty, then the algorithm identifies the subscribers in H that are adopters with the lowest IER. These subscribers are kept in V. This allows us to prune non-adopters with higher probability. A subscriber from V is then selected at random and removed from H. This can, however, separate H into disjoint graphs. If this is the case, then H keeps only the subgraph with the highest IER (ties decided at random) ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we develop}} a new {{methodology}} to estimate past changes of growing season temperature at Fontainebleau (northern France). Northern France temperature fluctuations have been documented by homogenised instrumental temperature records (at most 140 year long) and by grape harvest dates (GHD) series, incorporated {{in some of the}} European-scale temperature reconstructions. We have produced here three new proxy records: d 18 O and d 13 C of latewood cellulose of living trees and timbers from Fontainebleau Forest and Castle, together with ring widths of the same samples. d 13 C data appear to be influenced by tree and age effects; ring widths are not controlled by a single climate parameter. By contrast, d 18 O and Burgundy GHD series exhibit strong links with Fontainebleau growing season maximum temperature. Each of these records can also be influenced by other factors such as vine growing practices, local insolation, or moisture availability. In order to reduce the influence of these potential biases, we have used a linear combination of the two records to reconstruct inter-annual fluctuations of Fontainebleau growing season temperature from 1596 to 2000. Over the instrumental period, the reconstruction is well correlated with the temperature data (R 2 = 0. 60). This reconstruction is associated with an uncertainty of ~ 1. 1 °C (1. 5 standard deviation), and is expected to provide a reference series for the variability of growing season maximum temperature in Western Europe. Spectral analyses conducted on the reconstruction clearly evidence (i) the interest of combining the two proxy records in order to improve the power spectrum of the reconstructed versus observed temperature, (ii) changes in the spectral properties over the time, with varying weights of periodicities ranging between ~ 6 and ~ 25 years. Available reconstructions of regional growing season temperature fluctuations get increasingly divergent at the interannual or decadal scale prior to 1800. Our reconstruction suggests a warm interval in the late 17 th century, with the 1680 s as warm as the 1940 s, followed by a prolonged cool period from the 1690 s to the 1850 s culminating in the 1770 <b>s.</b> The <b>persistency</b> of the late 20 th century warming trend appears unprecedented...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the lactation curve traits of Anatolian buffaloes raised under different conditions in farms in Tokat Province, Turkey. Wood’s gamma curve parameters were employed to identify the lactation curve types, and values for the parameters beginning yield (a), coefficient of rising (b) and coefficient of decreasing (c) were used to determine the shape and type of lactation curve. All parameters in typical lactation curves were positive, and in the event of one parameter being negative, the curve was considered to be an atypical lactation curve. A total of 690 lactation curves were investigated. It was determined that 406 (58. 84 %) of these curves were typical, while 90 (13. 04 %) were concave and 194 (28. 12 %) of a decreasing type. For typical lactation curves, a, b, c, <b>persistency</b> (<b>S),</b> time after parturition until the peak yield occurs (Tmax), maximum daily peak yield (Ymax), and coefficient of determination (R 2) were 7. 14 ± 0. 008, 0. 85 ± 2. 1, 0. 40 ± 0. 001, 2. 68, 63. 6, 6. 41 and 76. 33, respectively. For concave lactation curves, values for a, b, c, Tmax, Ymax and R 2 were 4. 94 ± 0. 42, - 0. 73 ± 0. 016, - 0. 23 ± 0. 0038, 95. 40, 7. 41 ± 0. 004 and 71. 68, respectively. For decreasing typical lactation curves, values for a, b, c, Tmax, and R 2 were 5. 31 ± 0. 0041, - 0. 15 ± 0. 007, 0. 039 ± 0. 0023, 3. 89 ± 0. 11 and 79. 94, respectively. Parameters predicted by the Wood model within the scope of this study have the potential of being useful for breeding programmes. Further breeding/selection activities could be conducted by using the female Anatolian buffaloes with typical lactation curves...|$|R
40|$|Around 2. 4 {{million people}} in the {{mountain}} areas of Papua New Guinea depend on subsistence farming. For a long time this way of farming has been avoided, and sometimes derided, by many authorities and developers worldwide. Shifting cultivation and slash and burn techniques, in combination with population pressure, was leading to deforestation and soil degradation. The general belief was that investing in such a farming system wouldn t get us anywhere. Not so, say the authors of Subsistence agriculture improvement, whose practical manual has won many admirers since it was published 10 years ago. Now available to CTA <b>s</b> <b>subscribers,</b> it offers a worthy collection of ways to improve subsistence farming. It explains how to build an A-frame for making terraces and contour-ridges and how to recognise zinc deficiency in citrus, beans and potatoes. In between it provides information about composting, crafting, drying, cooking, planting and protecting. In addition it contains a section on commonly known plants for the mid-mountain subsistence garden. All in all, a manual useful for other tropical mountainous areas as well.
