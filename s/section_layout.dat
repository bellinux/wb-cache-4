In this paper we formulate the optimal code and data <b>section</b> <b>layout</b> problem as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem. The proposed formulation can handle: (i) on-chip and off-chip memory, (ii) multiple on-chip memory banks, (iii) single and dual ported on-chip RAMs, (iv) overlay of data sections, and (v) swapping of code and data (from/to external memory). Our experiments demonstrate that, for a moderately complex embedded system, the optimal results produced by our formulation took {{only a few minutes}} on a PC, and it matches, in terms of performance and on-chip memory size, with a hand-optimized code/data layout which took 1 manmonth. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} written to detail {{the process and}} results of the theatre history class that I {{assisted}} in teaching during the fall semester of 2005. It details the process of formulating the class structure, how the class proceeded, my lecture process, and finally the responses that the students had to the class. The first chapter of this paper goes into {{the process of getting}} the class formulated. When Shaun McCracken and I were asked to take over instruction of THEA 307 for the fall during Dr. Barnes 2 ̆ 7 sabbatical, rather than exactly following the process that the class had previously taken, we decided to alter some of the elements of the class. We added in a response system for the reading that the students would be doing through the semester. In addition to this, we put together a course packet of readings from plays and other books and essays to supplement the main book we would be using, rather than have the students buy another expensive book for the course that they would not entirely use throughout the semester, indeed the rest of the year. For the second chapter, I go into the class itself, its environment, the physical shape of the class as it went on and the grading for the semester. Third in this thesis is a look at the lectures that I performed for my section of the class time, the rationale behind the <b>section</b> <b>layout,</b> and where some of the readings had their basis in my assignment. Finally, the paper looks at the responses that the students had to the class itself and any possible improvements that I could be made in future classes of this type...|$|E
40|$|Total Productive {{maintenance}} (TPM) is {{an innovative}} approach which holds {{the potential for}} enhancing efficiency of production facilities. TPM {{is a process that}} maximizes the productivity of equipment for its entire life. It demands significant change of work culture and radical restructuring of work. It eliminates breakdowns and promotesautonomous operator maintenance through day-to-day activities, which involve the total workforce. It fosters an environment where improvement efforts in safety, quality, cost, delivery and creativity are encouraged through the participation of all employees. It is a strategicmanagement initiative to increase capacity and end the vicious cycle of breakdown or reactive repairs through the use of autonomous and predictive maintenance, as well as equipment modifications to facilitate optimum machine availability, quality and performance. TPM will drive the operational efficiency of a manufacturing environment and profitability of the organization. In our project we focus on studying the existing methods for rescheduling <b>Section</b> <b>Layout,</b> implementing 5 S Principles in the shop floor, manufacturing systems management, and maintenance management and to improve the efficiency of process with TPM implementation. 5 s is an integral step in TPM. It focuses on developing stability and standardization in the organization. It can provide benefits in areas from safety to quality. Time study and motion study were performed to identify the existing problems, faults and defects and to develop the knowledge on process handled in a small scale industry. It is then analyzed in detail and as a result inefficiencies of the present methodology are identified. We concentrate on improving the robustness of production process, improving utilization of labor forces, increasing equipment eliability and increasing the profit of the organization by satisfying the customers with the products. The impact of changes made as a consequence of implementing such improved methods was evaluated and benefits were discussed...|$|E

40|$|This {{proceedings}} volume contains papers {{presented at}} technology transfer seminars {{sponsored by the}} National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) on New Technology for Ground Control in Retreat Mining. The seminars were conducted at five locations: Uniontown, PA (March 26, 1997), Norton, VA (April 8, 1997), Pikeville, KY (April 10, 1997), Charleston, WV (April 17, 1997), and Evansville, IN (April 22, 1997). The papers presented here describe several new, highly practical technologies developed by the NIOSH Pittsburgh and Spokane Research Centers 3 to improve safety during pillar retreat operations. Two central issues are addressed: pillar design and mobile roof supports (MRS's). Proper pillar sizing is essential for safe pillar extraction. The Analysis of Retreat Mining Pillar Stability (ARMPS) program and its large data base of actual mining case histories are presented. LAMODEL, a second computer program, {{can be used for}} analysis of multiple-seam and other complex mining situations. Other papers address pillar design to avoid massive pillar collapses and the proper role of coal strength testing. MRS's have greatly improved safety where they are used for pillar line support. We studied the application of MRS's at 20 mines throughout the Eastern United States. Conclusions regarding the most effective <b>section</b> <b>layouts,</b> cut sequences, and support placements are reported. Field and laboratory tests of MRS's are also described...|$|R
