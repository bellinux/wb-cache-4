40|$|International audienceTUniform {{distribution}} of fluids {{is crucial to}} obtain high performance in compact heat exchangers. Maldistribution has been studied by many authors, especially for parallel channels heat exchangers. But theoretical models and experimental studies for predicting flow maldistribution in offset <b>strip</b> <b>fins</b> exchangers are scarce. Offset <b>strip</b> <b>fins,</b> besides their higher thermal hydraulic performances, favour lateral distribution due to their geometry. In this work, an experimental investigation {{has been carried out}} for this type of heat exchanger. The experimental set-up consists in a flat vertical compact heat exchanger (1 m x 1 m area and 7. 13 mm thickness) equipped with offset <b>strip</b> <b>fins</b> with a hydraulic diameter of 1. 397 mm. Air and water are the working fluids. The flow rates of each phase in seven zones regularly distributed at the outlet have been measured as well as the pressures at the inlet, the outlet and two intermediate positions. These measurements were completed with visualisations using a high-speed camera. First, the single-phase flow has been investigated. A correlation for friction factor has been derived from experiments covering laminar, transition and turbulent regimes. CFD simulations of the single-phase flow have been performed. The numerical results were compared with the determined correlation and with correlations available in the literature. In single-phase flow, a uniform distribution was experimentally observed. Then, the two-phase hydrodynamics was characterised. A flow regime map was established and the influences of phases inlet directions (co-current and counter-current inlets of the phases) and of superficial velocities on the distribution were studied. The gas superficial velocity has more effect on the distribution than the liquid one. Comparison between pressure drop profiles and flow rate distribution profiles shows that information about pressure drop can provide information about phase distribution. It must be noticed that the nonuniform {{distribution of}} phases can entail the coexistence of several flow regimes in the heat exchanger...|$|R

Also, air (gas) flow maldistribution in the headers, caused by the orientation of inlet and outlet nozzles in the heat exchanger, affects the exchanger performance. Three typical compact plate-fin heat exchangers have been analyzed using Fluent software for quantification of flow maldistribution effects with ideal and real cases. The headers have modified by providing suitable baffle plates for improvement in flow distribution. Three offset <b>strip</b> <b>fin</b> and 16 wavy fin geometries used in the compact plate-fin heat exchangers have also been analyzed numerically.

40|$|Devices {{used for}} various {{electronic}} purposes are increasing in power consumption and performance. Due to this growth, {{the amount of}} heat dissipated over a small surface area has proportionally continued to increase. Despite previous efforts involving single phase natural and forced convection, these methods are no longer effective in high heat removal. Research in two-phase liquid cooling has become more prominent. Boiling {{has the potential to}} yield large critical heat flux values, high heat transfer coefficients and lower pressure drops. Many different surface enhancements and working fluids have been tested to increase efficiency and minimize heat losses. Flow boiling in microchannels have been widely explored in literature for high heat flux dissipation. Microchannels are compact and subsequently easy to manufacture. However, due to flow instabilities that accompany microchannels, different configurations and additional modifications have been explored in order to maximize performance. In this work, a radial geometry is experimentally investigated with a flow inlet over the center of the chip. This central inlet creates a reduction in flow length and therefore a reduction in pressure drop and flow instabilities. Two testing surfaces were explored including a radial microchannel array and a radial offset <b>strip</b> <b>fin</b> array. To maximize performance even further, a gap has been added between the cover plate and testing surface to increase flow area and reduce pressure drop. One significant observation shows that an increase in flow rate mitigates the instabilities seen in the channels and prolongs critical heat flux (CHF). Due to these phenomena, all configurations are tested in the modified configuration with higher flow rates ranging from 120 - 320 mL/min. Radial microchannels with an added gap yielded maximum performance values of 385. 5 W/cm^ 2 at 42. 7 °C wall superheat with a high pressure drop of about 140 kPa while the offset <b>strip</b> <b>fin</b> configuration achieved much higher heat transfer performance with CHF values exceeding 900 W/cm^ 2 at 58. 6 °C wall superheat.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of heat exchangers {{is important in}} the HV ACIR industry. Driven by high energy standards and increasing competition, manufacturers are seeking to decrease air-side resistance in heat exchangers by increasing the heat transfer coefficient. Offset <b>strip</b> and louvered <b>fins</b> increase the heat transfer coefficient through two methods [...] boundary layer restarting and the initiation of self-sustained oscillations. The purpose of this thesis is to develop a better understanding of flow and heat transfer in offset <b>strip</b> and louvered <b>fins</b> so that design guidelines may be developed. Five geometries are analyzed in this study [...] two offset strip and three louvered with a 25 - angle of incidence [...] over a Reynolds number range of 100 to 12000. Heat transfer is inferred from mass transfer data acquired using the naphthalene sublimation method, and pressure drop across each array is detennined using conventional methods. Flow visualization studies are performed to develop a more complete understanding of the actual flow mechanisms. The results show that vortex shedding in the periodic regime increases heat transfer significantly. Measurements of local mass transfer along a fin show that local heat transfer behavior on a fin is different for offset <b>strip</b> and louvered <b>fins,</b> and these results are used to develop design guidelines Because of the flow structures at work, short louvered fins may be especially advantageous. Studies of overall behavior show that at a given Reynolds number, louvered fins require less area for a given heat duty than do offset strip fms. However, pumping power is significantly higher for louvered fins. Therefore, if heat exchanger efficiency is more important than heat exchanger size, offset <b>strip</b> <b>fins</b> may be just as desirable if not more desirable than louvered fins for certain exchanger geometries and operating conditions.

40|$|The {{high heat}} {{transfer}} coefficients in microchannels are attractive for direct cooling of computer chips requiring high heat-flux removal. However, the high heat removal capability of microchannels {{is associated with}} a severe pressure drop penalty. Channel size optimization therefore becomes necessary in selecting an appropriate channel geometry configuration. As the heat flux increases beyond about 2 MW/m 2, the heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics of the plain channels dictate the use of turbulent flow through the channels, which suffers from an excessive pressure drop penalty. It therefore becomes essential to incorporate enhancement features in the microchannels and multiple passes with shorter flow lengths to provide the desired solution. Results obtained from a theoretical analysis are presented as parametric plots for the heat transfer and pressure drop performance of a 10 × 10 - 3 m × 10 × 10 - 3 m (10 mm x 10 mm) silicon chip incorporating plain microchannels. The enhanced microchannels with offset <b>strip</b> <b>fins</b> in single-pass and split-flow arrangements are also investigated.

40|$|Thermal Dissipation is a {{critical}} issue {{in the performance of}} semiconductor devices. The current practice is to use forced convection by air over a heat sink which is bonded to the microelectronic device. With increased packing density of the circuits inside a chip, large amounts of heat is generated and air cooling is no longer sufficient. Forced liquid convection using microchannels {{is considered to be a}} viable option for cooling of these microprocessor chips. This work deals with the evaluation of the single phase pressure drop in microchannels. There are two types of microchannels under consideration. Plain microchannels which have basically long uninterrupted flow channels while the enhanced channels which have the interrupted flow lengths. Enhanced microchannels, because of their offset <b>strip</b> <b>fin</b> geometry, significantly increase both the heat transfer as well as the pressure drop. This work deals with the evaluation of single phase flow pressure drop in both plain and enhanced microchannels. For plain microchannels there have been a few investigations in the literature which suggest that the microchannel performance can generally be predicted using the classical fluid flow equations. However there are some experiments that still show departure from the classical theory that cannot be explained. It is proposed in this work that the reason for this discrepancy can be traced to the effects due to flow maldistribution in plain microchannels. A systematic experimental investigation is performed to study the effects of slight variations in channel dimensions and their influence on the flow maldistribution in an attempt to validate the applicability of classical theory to microchannel flows. Enhanced microchannels however have not been investigated thoroughly. There is very few data available in the literature. FLUENT is a CFD software which can be used as a tool to design and optimize these enhanced channels. However it has to be first validated with experiments. Thus pressure drop experiments are carried out on an offset <b>strip</b> <b>fin</b> silicon microchannel and the data is predicted using FLUENT, which is CFD software. Also existing predictive models for friction factor in offset <b>strip</b> <b>fin</b> minichannels are tested to check their validity for microchannel flows. For plain microchannels, it seen that with uniform flow assumption, the friction factor is either underpredicted or overpredicted using the theory depending upon the reference channel dimension. However by accounting flow maldistribution in plain microchannels, friction factor can be accurately determined using theoretical equations. For enhanced microchannels it is observed that FLUENT can predict the pressure drop within 10 %. In this work only adiabatic flows are considered. It is recommended that this work should be extended to flows with heat transfer...|$|E

40|$|The {{process in}} a gas turbine plant {{involves}} certain losses which {{can be divided into}} internal and external losses. In term of internal losses, the main factor is changing the state of working fluid. Since the temperature of atmospheric air may vary within a wide range, its variations can influence strongly the efficiency of gas turbine plants. With growing ambient air temperature, the specific volume of air increases, which can result in a larger work spent for air compression in the compressor. One of the most effective method for increasing the efficiency of gas turbine plants is to raise the gas temperature before the turbine. Since this temperature is the highest temperature in the cycle, this method is applicable for gas turbine plants of any scheme and type. However, there are some limitations on increasing gas temperature. The allowable temperature for reliable operation is between 1000 and 1400 k. However, decreasing ambient air temperature to increase the efficiency of gas turbine plants is easier and at low costs compared to rising gas temperature. As a decrease of 1 °C temperature of inlet air increases the power output by 1 %. In this paper our objective is improving the efficiency of gas turbine plants by decreasing ambient air temperature.

40|$|Plate-fin heat {{exchangers}} (PFHEs) are extensively implemented in practical applications {{due to their}} superior compactness and comparatively good heat transfer rate. Nevertheless, the desired high performance and relatively low weight is connected to high pressure drops that consequently result in additional costs. Hence, the design task of PFHEs for industrial applications is an intricate process. To overcome the existing difficulties, this research presents a novel evolutionary-based approach for design optimization of PFHEs based on variable operating conditions instead of the conventional constant heat duty over the working period of the {{heat exchangers}}. To find the best suited evolutionary algorithm (EA) for the problem at hand, various widely used EAs are modified and tested on several practical problems. Moreover, since the heat exchanger design optimization is a highly constrained problem and the EAs are not equipped with constraint handling capabilities, conventional external strategies such as penalty function methods have been employed for this problem. The fine-tuning of the penalty parameters have been a drawback of using these methods, therefore a novel feasibility-based ranking strategy is proposed and utilized in the existing EAs. Using the proposed constrained EAs, {{the design of the}} PFHEs is presented based on entropy generation minimization (EGM) and economic considerations. Cross-flow PFHEs with offset <b>strip</b> <b>fins</b> on both sides are considered while method and the correlations available in the literature are employed for rating the heat exchangers. Illustrative case studies from literature are considered to show the efficiency and the accuracy of the proposed methods.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a comprehensive thermal hydraulic {{analysis of a}} compact heat exchanger using offset <b>strip</b> <b>fins.</b> The thermal hydraulics analysis in this work {{is followed by a}} finite element analysis (FEA) to predict the mechanical stresses experienced by an intermediate heat exchanger (IHX) during steady-state operation and selected flow transients. In particular, the scenario analyzed involves a gas-to-liquid IHX operating between high pressure helium and liquid or molten salt. In order to estimate the stresses in compact heat exchangers a comprehensive thermal and hydraulic analysis is needed. Compact heat exchangers require very small flow channels and fins to achieve high heat transfer rates and thermal effectiveness. However, studying such small features computationally contributes little to the understanding of component level phenomena and requires prohibitive computational effort using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). To address this issue, the analysis developed here uses an effective porous media (EPM) approach; this greatly reduces the computation time and produces results with the appropriate resolution [1]. This EPM fluid dynamics and heat transfer computational code has been named the Compact Heat Exchanger Explicit Thermal and Hydraulics (CHEETAH) code. CHEETAH solves for the two-dimensional steady-state and transient temperature and flow distributions in the IHX including the complicating effects of temperature-dependent fluid thermophysical properties. Temperature- and pressure-dependent fluid properties are evaluated by CHEETAH and the thermal effectiveness of the IHX is also calculated. Furthermore, the temperature distribution can then be imported into a finite element analysis (FEA) code for mechanical stress analysis using the EPM methods developed earlier by the University of California, Berkeley, for global and local stress analysis [2]. These simulation tools will also allow the heat exchanger design to be improved through an iterative design process which will lead to a design with a reduced pressure drop, increased thermal effectiveness, and improved mechanical performance as it relates to creep deformation and transient thermal stresses...|$|R

At present winding machine in China mostly belongs to the semi-mechanized and semi-manual operation, with low efficiency, small size and unstable quality, which cannot meet the requirements of modern enterprise production; hence it is necessary to develop a winding machine with automatic processing ability and high precision. In this research the control system of winding parts of Aluminum strip minding machine was studied. Based on the analysis of the overall structure of winding machine control system, the hardware components, speed of running, the application of the position control system were observed. The processing parameters, the control algorithm and a module I/O assignment of TRIO motion control card were obtained. The analysis of critical point in programming conducted was realized and the control system software was designed.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to evaluate different heating methods for thermal structural testing of large scale structures at temperatures up to 350 °F as part of the High Speed Research program. The heating techniques evaluated included: radiative/convective, forced convective, and conductive. The radiative/convective heaters included <b>finned</b> <b>strip</b> heaters, and clear and frosted quartz lamps. The forced convective heating was accomplished by closed loop circulation of heated air. The conductive heater consisted of heating blankets. The tests were conducted on an 1 / 8 inch thick stainless steel plate in a custom-built oven. The criteria used for comparing the different heating methods included test specimen temperature uniformity, heater response time, and consumed power. The parameters investigated included air circulation in the oven, reflectance of oven walls, and the orientation of the test specimen and heaters (vertical and horizontal). It was found that reflectance of oven w [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In the {{cryogenics}} field, high effectiveness {{heat exchangers}} {{of the order}} of 0. 96 or higher are widely used for preserving the refrigeration effect produced. So, there will be no liquid yield if the effectiveness falls below that of the design value. Due to high effectiveness, low weight & compactness, the compact heat exchangers have their extensive applications in the air-conditioning system, oil industries, food industries & in the process industries. The plate fin heat exchangers (PFHE) is a type of compact heat exchanger which is manufactured by brazing a stack of alternate plates (parting sheets) & corrugated fins together. The exchange of heat occurs by the streams through the fins. Generally, aluminium is used for manufacturing PFHE due to their high thermal conductivity & low cost. In the plate fin heat exchanger, the pressure drop is also measured along with the effectiveness. The increase in pressure gradient can be outweighed by decreasing the passage length so that an acceptable pressure drop can be achieved. There is enormous research is going on to make out the heat transfer phenomena & also to determine the dimensionless heat transfer coefficients those are the Colburn factor (j) and the friction factor (f). This thesis on the offset <b>strip</b> plate <b>fin</b> heat exchanger compares the effectiveness, overall thermal conductance & the pressure drop obtained from the experimental data with some correlations on plate fin heat exchanger i. e., Joshi-Webb correlation, Maiti-Sarangi correlation, Manglik-Bergles correlation and also with the numerically achieved data obtained by using CFD...|$|R
40|$|International audienceContrasting to {{the overall}} {{oligotrophic}} Mediterranean Sea, the north-western basin is characterised by high productivity and marked by seasonality, which induces spatiotemporal heterogeneity of habitat. Cetaceans and seabirds are expected to perceive this repetition of the seasonal cycle and to anticipate the recurrent variability of their environment. Because phenology imposes strong constraints over marine predators, especially through reproduction, we expected them to exhibit variations in their habitat preferences over seasons. Indeed, during reproductive period, marine predators have to face their own needs and those of their young, while out of this period, they can focus on maximising their own survival only. We therefore hypothesised that some species would change their habitat preferences to exploit the most favourable habitat during each season, while other species might accommodate the same habitat all year-round, for example thanks {{to the use of}} an habitat favourable all the year. To explore these hypotheses, we used aerial surveys data conducted over north-western Mediterranean Sea during winter 2011 – 2012 and summer 2012. Generalised Additive Models were used to link the species density to a set of 12 physiographic and oceanographic predictors describing their environment. Habitat models resulted in deviances from 12 to 47 %. Our results provided the first assessment of habitat preferences for the winter season for most of our studied species. Small-sized delphinids (mostly <b>stripped</b> dolphins), <b>fin</b> whales, Globicephalinae (long-finned pilot whales and Risso׳s dolphins) and small-sized shearwaters (Yelkouan and Balearic shearwaters) exhibited no habitat variations between seasons, although for the first two, abundances were lower in winter. On the contrary, bottlenose dolphins switched from coastal habitat in summer to pelagic habitat in winter, while Cory׳s shearwaters and storm petrels exhibited the largest habitat variations between seasons with a complete absence during winter...|$|R
