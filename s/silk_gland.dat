These domains are conserved not only between spidroin 1 and 2, but also among many silk types and spider species. Experimental data show the N- and C-terminal domains contribute to fiber assembly.

40|$|The {{mulberry}} silkworm, Bombyx mori has {{a pair of}} {{salivary glands}} arising from the mandibular segment, {{in addition to the}} labial <b>silk</b> <b>glands</b> which are generally considered as modified salivary glands.

These individual glands extend up to the $T_ 1 $ thoracic segment unlike <b>silk</b> <b>glands</b> with fused anterior ends and extending up to the caudal region. The salivary glands also undergo endomitosis resembling the <b>silk</b> <b>glands.</b> The B. mori homologue of the homeotic gene Deformed (BmDfd) was expressed in the mandibular and maxillary segments in stage 17 embryo and got localized to the centre of the mandibular segment at stage 18 to form the salivary gland placodes. The expression was also seen in the distal ends of the leg appendages after blastokinesis (stage 22). Only low variations in BmDfd expression ranging from 1. 6 to 2. 1 fold were apparent during embryonic development. BmDfd expression was observed in the salivary glands all through the larval instars but not in the <b>silk</b> <b>glands.</b> The transcription factor, Forkhead and the segment polarity gene, Wingless were expressed throughout the salivary glands, the latter confirming the absence of physiological compartmentation within these <b>glands</b> unlike the <b>silk</b> <b>glands.</b> The expression of Amylase and Fibrohexamerin was restricted to the salivary and <b>silk</b> <b>glands,</b> respectively and therefore, served as molecular markers for these tissues...|$|R

To investigate whether the insulin signaling pathway is involved in endomitosis in <b>silk</b> <b>gland</b> cells, in this study, we initially analyzed the effects of bovine insulin on DNA synthesis in endomitotic <b>silk</b> <b>gland</b> cells using 5 -bromo- 2 '-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling technology, and found that bovine insulin can stimulate DNA synthesis. Insulin signal transduction is mainly mediated via phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) /Akt, the target of rapamycin (TOR) and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways in vertebrates. We ascertained that these three pathways are involved in DNA synthesis in endomitotic <b>silk</b> <b>gland</b> cells using specific inhibitors against each pathway. Moreover, we investigated whether these three pathways are involved in insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis in endomitotic <b>silk</b> <b>gland</b> cells, and found that the PI 3 K/Akt and TOR pathways, but not the ERK pathway, are involved in this process.

It is suggested that the fastest 10 S component is the native fibroin synthesized in the posterior <b>silk</b> <b>gland</b> and transferred to the middle <b>silk</b> <b>gland</b> to be stored there, while the slower three components probably correspond to inner, middle, and outer sericins which were synthesized in the posterior, middle, and anterior portion of the middle <b>silk</b> <b>gland,</b> respectively.

40|$|Abstract The gene {{encoding}} fibroin {{light chain}} protein (FibL) is specifically {{expressed in the}} posterior <b>silk</b> <b>gland</b> of silkworm and repressed in other tissues. The binding sites of several transcription factors involved in the <b>silk</b> <b>gland</b> transcription specificity of fibl promoter have been recognized, including SGFB, PSGF and BMFA.

40|$|The <b>silk</b> <b>glands</b> of {{mulberry}} silkworm Bombyx mori are endoreplicating tissues {{in which the}} genomic DNA undergoes multiple rounds of replication without mitosis and nuclear division. In the absence of normal mitotic division, the cell cycle essentially alternates between the G 1 and S phases. Cyclin E is crucial for the G 1 /S transition in both mitotic and endoreplicating cycles. We have cloned and characterized cyclin E (cyclin box) from B. mori, which is nearly identical to the Drosophila cyclin E box except for an insertion of 21 amino acids. Two distinct cyclin E transcripts (1. 7 and 2. 1 kb) were detected in the silk-gland cells of B. mori and in the B. mori-derived embryonic cell line, BmN. Using anti Cyclin E antibodies two protein bands of 52 and 44 kDa were detected in <b>silk</b> <b>glands</b> and BmN cells at Comparable levels.

40|$|The {{addition}} of exogenous histones has an inhibitory effect on fibroin gene transcription in posterior <b>silk</b> <b>gland</b> extracts. The histones probably disturb {{a process in}} complex formation, because when transcription complexes were constructed by preincubation of the templates with the extracts, the inhibitory effect of histones was greatly reduced. Transcription of a fibroin gene construct, pFb 5 ' delta- 238, having the upstream region beyond the TATA box was relatively less inhibited than that of pFb 5 ' delta- 44 lacking the upstream region. This tendency toward differential inhibition was observed in the <b>silk</b> <b>gland</b> extracts {{but not in a}} HeLa cell extract and persisted even after complex formation in the <b>silk</b> <b>gland</b> extracts, suggesting a specific interaction of the upstream region with some factors in the extracts. The complexes formed on pFb 5 ' delta- 44 are probably more susceptible to the inhibitory effect of histones. On the basis of these results we propose a participation of the upstream region of the fibroin gene in the formation of stable transcription complexes at the promoter through an interaction with specific factors in the <b>silk</b> <b>gland.</b> Since the transcription-enhancing effect via the upstream region is augmented at a high histone/DNA ratio, it may mimic the in vivo situation in which the fibroin gene can be transcribed in the posterior <b>silk</b> <b>gland</b> even in the presence of excess suppressive materials...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe <b>silk</b> <b>gland</b> is a {{specific}} larval tissue of Lepidopteran insects and begins to degenerate shortly before pupation. The steroid hormone ecdysone triggers the stage specific programmed cell death of the anterior silk glands during metamorphosis in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. The anterior <b>silk</b> <b>gland</b> expresses ecdysone receptors, which are involved in regulation processes in response to ecdysone. In this study, the morphological changes, immunohistochemical localization and protein levels of ecdysone receptor B 1 (EcR-B 1) in the anterior <b>silk</b> <b>gland</b> of B. mori were investigated during programmed cell death. Morphological changes observed during the degeneration process involve the appearance of large vacuoles, probably autophagic vacuoles, which increase in number in pupal anterior silk glands. No macrophages {{were found in the}} <b>silk</b> <b>gland</b> during the prepupal and pupal stage unlike in apoptosis, which strongly suggests that programmed cell death of the anterior <b>silk</b> <b>gland</b> is carried out by autophagy. Morphological changes of the silk glands were accompanied by changes in the immunolocalization and protein levels of EcR-B 1. The differences in tissue distribution and protein levels of EcR-B 1 during the programmed cell death indicate that the receptor {{plays a major role in}} the modulation and function of ecdysone activity in Bombyx anterior silk glands. Our results indicate that EcR-B 1 expression may be important for the process of programmed cell death in the anterior silk glands...|$|E

To examine the peculiarities of mast building in Dyopedos bispinis, we studied the social structure of individuals inhabiting the masts and identified the preferred substrata through underwater photography and direct observations, characterized {{the internal and external}} structures of the masts, and studied the ultrastructure of pereopodal <b>silk</b> <b>glands</b> using scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM, respectively). The most frequent substrata for mast building are other fouling organisms, including hydroids, bryozoans, ascidians and sponges. As in other corophiids, each Dyopedos bispinis mast represents the territory of one female and, occasionally, one male, but unique collective masts occupied by three or more (up to 23) adults were also observed. Masts comprise one or 2 - 4 central cylinders and a laminated cortex that contains detritus and amphipod silk layers. The pereopodal glandular complex of Dyopedos bispinis is composed of two distinct gland groups, proximal and distal, in each pereopod 3 - 4, and ducts in the glandular complex lead into a common chamber in the dactylus. The proximal glands are multicellular; their secretory cells are uninuclear, unlike in certain other amphipods; and the cell membrane is deeply invaginated. The invaginations are filled with extensions of the cytoplasm of lining cells, but the origin of the lining is unclear.
