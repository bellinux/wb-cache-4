These Queen Elizabeth 2 shipments included M16, CAR-15, AR-18 and AR-15 Armalite rifles, accompanied by Browning pistols and Smith & Wesson pistols and revolvers and were driven from Southampton to Belfast in <b>small</b> <b>consignments.</b>|$|E
500|$|Passenger {{traffic was}} {{the main source of}} revenue for the GWR when it first opened but goods were also carried in {{separate}} trains. It was not until the coal-mining and industrial districts of Wales and the Midlands were reached that goods traffic became significant; in 1856 the Ruabon Coal Company signed an agreement with the GWR to transport coal to London at special rates which nonetheless was worth at least £40,000 each year to the railway. As locomotives increased in size so did the length of goods trains, from 40 to as many as 100 four-wheeled wagons, although the gradient of the line often limited this. While typical goods wagons could carry 8, 10 or (later) 12 tons, the load placed into a wagon could be as little as 1 ton. The many smaller consignments were sent to a local transhipment centre where they were re-sorted into larger loads for the main segment of their journey. There were more than 550 [...] "station truck" [...] workings running on timetabled goods trains carrying <b>small</b> <b>consignments</b> to and from specified stations, and 200 [...] "pick up" [...] trucks that collected small loads from groups of stations.|$|E

30|$|According to Deardorff (2005), {{theories}} {{of international trade}} often assume that transport is costless and instant, or it is simply treated as an add-on. For example, when interviewing Swedish manufacturing firms, Lindau et al. (2004) identified an attitude of treating transport services as “a given infinite commodity available at a market price”. This approach is sufficient for selecting hauliers for short distance transport, but much more effort must be spent on inter-continental transport with a large and increasing share of the supply chain’s lead times, costs and environmental impacts. Supply chain managers trained and used to solving lead time issues by shortening {{the length of the}} chain and send <b>small</b> <b>consignment</b> with road transport. Global supply chains minimising labour costs for each manufacturing step involves true challenges by reintroducing long transport lead times; slow-steaming amplifies these effects.|$|R

2500|$|The {{normal route}} of Italian supply to Tripoli in Libya, went west round Sicily and then {{close to the}} coast to the port, about , to avoid {{interference}} from British aircraft, ships and submarines based at Malta.

The road could flood, was vulnerable to the Desert Air Force (DAF) and alternative desert tracks increased vehicle wear. The Italian advance over the Egyptian frontier in late 1940, increased the road transport distance from Tripoli over the Khedival Motor Road, which was much inferior to the Via Balbia.|$|E
60|$|Six {{weeks after}} the victory the prince's army mustered nearly six {{thousand}} men; but Macleod, Macdonald, and Lovat, who could have brought a further force of four thousand men, still held aloof. Had these three powerful chiefs joined at once after the battle of Prestonpans, Prince Charles could have marched to London, and would probably have succeeded in placing his father on the throne, without having occasion to strike another blow; but they came not, and the delay caused during the fruitless negotiations enabled the English troops to be brought over from Flanders, while Prince Charles on his side only received a few <b>small</b> <b>consignments</b> of arms and money from France.|$|E

40|$|To {{address the}} illicit {{cigarette}} trade, the European Union (EU) has signed {{agreements with the}} four major Transnational Tobacco Companies (TTCs) that involve establishing extensive systems of cooperation. All agreements foresee two types of payments: annual payments (totalling US$ 1. 9 billion over 20 years) and supplementary seizure payments, equivalent to 100 % of the evaded taxes {{in the event of}} seizures of their products. While limited by the fundamental lack of transparency in this area, our analysis suggests that these agreements have served largely to secure the TTCs' interests and are threatening progress in tobacco control. The seizure payments are paltry and a wholly inadequate deterrent to TTC involvement in illicit trade. Despite the agreements, growing evidence indicates the TTCs remain involved in the illicit trade or are at best failing to secure their supply chains as required by the agreements. The intention of the seizure-based payments to deter the tobacco industry from further involvement in the illicit cigarette trade has failed because the agreements contain too many loopholes that provide TTCs with both the incentive and opportunity to classify seized cigarettes as counterfeit. In addition, the shifting nature of cigarette smuggling from larger to <b>smaller</b> <b>consignments</b> often results in seizures that are too small to qualify for the payments. Consequently, the seizure payments represent {{a tiny fraction of the}} revenue lost from cigarette smuggling, between 2004 and 2012, 0. 08 % of the estimated losses due to illicit cigarette trade in the EU. Our evidence suggests the EU should end these agreements...|$|R

5000|$|Shawmut's {{maiden voyage}} led to {{questions}} about whether such large ships could be profitable with specific questions concerning even larger ships being built by James J.

The ship had arrived in Seattle to begin loading for the voyage on 22 July 1902 sailing for Tacoma on 25 July to load cargo, largely of lumber {{that had to be}} transshipped due to the fact the ship was too large to enter the lumber port, and took until 22 August to fully load cargo from scattered origins. She sailed on 22 August with a stop at Seattle before proceeding to sea that night and reached Yokohama 12 September unloading a <b>small</b> <b>consignment.</b> The lumber was destined for Shanghai, but the ship was too large to reach the docks on arrival 20 September and had to unload by lighter taking until 13 October before departure for Hong Kong. On reaching Hong Kong 18 October where there was little cargo to load and only a small amount to carry on to Manila upon departure 8 November. By 22 November Shawmut was in Yokohama for a final stop before departure for Seattle on 23 November where she arrived 8 December, 139 days for the voyage. The ship had carried a then record breaking 13,000 tons of cargo, but returned with only about 2,500 tons and an estimated deficit of over $21,000 for the trip. There was speculation that Hill had used a Boston company to [...] "experiment" [...] on using large ships for the trade before committing his vessels.|$|R
40|$|Some {{time ago}} the Leyden Museum {{received}} from Mr. Jackson Demery, the Liberian correspondent of Dr. Büttikofer, a <b>small</b> <b>consignment</b> of beetles collected at Robertsport, Grand Cape Mount (Western Liberia).

XI, figs. 5 and 5 a). As, however, Westwood has derived the description from a single specimen (the Fabrician type) and the figure drawn from an other (Gory’s typical specimen) whereas I myself have several males and females before me, I can state that Westwood is wrong in supposing the small notch in the lateral margins of the prothorax (see fig. 5) to be due to an injury: it is very distinct in almost all our specimens; the minute circular impressions on the disc before the middle, however, are much less constant: in several of my specimens they are wanting, in others they are four in number and irregularly arranged. As to the legs Westwood says: »the posterior margin of the four hind legs is clothed with luteous hairs”, but this is not correct: the posterior margin (under side) of the fore- and middle legs (femora) is clothed with luteous hairs, which are much more densely set (feltlike) in the male than in the female. — The middle of the abdomen is flattened in the male, convex in the female, the pygidium transverse in the male, more triangular in the female, and the calcaria of the hind tibiae are more slender and acute in the male, broader and more obtuse in the female...|$|R

50|$|Wholesalers, like Costco, buy the {{products}} from the manufacturer and sell them to the consumer. In this channel, consumers can buy products directly from the wholesaler in bulk. By buying the items in bulk from the wholesaler the prices of the product are reduced. This is because the wholesaler takes away extra costs, such as service costs or sales force costs, that customers usually pay when buying from retail; making the price much cheaper for the consumer. However, the wholesaler does not always sell directly to the consumer. Sometimes the wholesaler will go through a retailer before the product gets {{into the hands of}} the consumer. Each dealer (the manufacturer, the wholesaler, and the retailer) will be looking to make a decent profit margin from the product. So each time the buyer purchases the merchandise from another source, the price of the product has to increase, in order to maximize the profit each person will receive. This raises the price of the product for the end-user. Due to the simultaneous and joint work of wholesaler and retailer, a trade can only be beneficial if; a market is situated on a larger area, the supply of goods and products is carried out <b>small</b> but urgent <b>consignments</b> (products), it can be cost-effective and profitable by supplying bigger consignments (products) to fewer customers. Industrial factories are in the seek of using advantages of mass production in order to produce and sell big lots (batches) while retailers look and prefer purchasing <b>smaller</b> <b>consignments.</b> This method for factories could lead to instant sales, high efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Therefore, particularly in these situations wholesaler now plays a role where it reconciles these contradictory aspirations. The wholesaler purchases big lots then divides minimizes after resells them to further retailers. The work of wholesaler facilitates and makes it less burdensome for the transportation of production. Hence, an amount of delivered goods diminishes through the use of this channel (the wholesale). For example, if five manufactories supply goods directly to hundred different retail stores, then they will have to have 500 of deliveries (5 times 100). However, if those five manufactories supply the same wholesaler, and the wholesaler at this stage supplies 100 different retailers, then the total number of deliveries will decrease to 105 (5 plus 100). Another important component to consider in the practice of wholesaling is storage. Storage of goods is one of the characterized aspects of the work of a wholesaler. Wholesaler regulates the deliveries of goods, having synchronized the production and consumption of material goods. Moreover, he as the wholesaler further assumes the financial obligations related to the immobilization of funds invested in the creation of commodity stocks. Although, the chain of transition suggests that the wholesaler directly communicates and deals with a manufacturer may not be unambiguous. The contribution of a distributor is highly acknowledged and plays a crucial role in distributing flows of goods before it gets in the hands of wholesalers, retailers and so on. A distributor is the representative of the manufacturer and performs functions on behalf of the manufacturer for the distribution of goods from producer to wholesaler or retailer. A distributor is always in the seek out for orders from different clients and possesses activeness in promoting producer's products and services. The main tasks of a distributor are; study the market and the creation of databases of consumers, advertising of goods, an organization of a service for the delivery of goods, stocking up the inventory levels, the creation of a stable sales network, which includes dealers and other intermediaries, depending on the market situation. Distributors scarcely sell a manufactories' goods directly to customers.|$|R

40|$|These {{guidelines}} describe technical {{procedures that}} {{minimize the risk}} of pest introductions with movement of cacao germplasm for research, crop improvement, plant breeding, exploration or conservation. The recommendations made in these guidelines are intended for <b>small,</b> specialized <b>consignments</b> used in research programmes, e. g. for collection, conservation and utilization for breeding of plant genetic resources. These guidelines are not meant for trade and commercial consignments concerning export and import of germplasm or cocoa beans. The conservation and utilization of plant genetic resources and their global distribution are essential components of research activities underpinning improvement programmes. Inevitably, the movement of germplasm involves a risk of accidentally introducing pests along with the host plant. To minimize such risks, preventive measures and effective testing procedures are required to ensure that distributed material is free of pests of potential phytosanitary importance. The international, and inter-regional, movement of germplasm for research, conservation and breeding requires complete and up to date information concerning the phytosanitary status of the plant germplasm. Relevant and current national regulatory information governing the export and importation of plant germplasm in countries is essential. This revision has been produced by the Safe Movement Working Group of CacaoNet. These reflect the consensus and knowledge of the specialists who have contributed to this revision but the information provided needs to be regularly updated.

40|$|PURPOSE: This {{case study}} was written {{as a tool}} for {{students}} to use in evaluating the place of technology in <b>small</b> businesses. Georgie’s <b>Consignment</b> Shop was used as the focus of this case, which asked for analysis of the current and potential inventory and customer relationship management (CRM) systems. PROCEDURES: Local consignment shop owner Georgie Roth was interviewed in regards to her business, Georgie’s Consignment Shop in Ada, Michigan. This interview, along with industry and local market research, was used to compose an original case study and instructor’s manual to be used in class discussions. The case seeks to analyze whether the implementation of technology, namely an inventory management and CRM system, will be a helpful and profitable investment for Georgie 2 ̆ 7 s Consignment Shop. The subsequent instructor 2 ̆ 7 s manual addresses suggested teaching approaches, student discussion questions and answers, an instructor 2 ̆ 7 s chalkboard diagram, a process flowchart, and a comprehensive SWOT analysis, called a TOWS matrix. CONCLUSIONS: The case study allows students to arrive at their own conclusion; however, it guides them to make a decision not involving technology. As this is counterintuitive for many classrooms and students today, it opens the door for critical discussion of technology implementation with a cost benefit analysis. IMPACT: There are few case studies written in small business management, especially in regards to their IT needs. The Georgie’s Consignment Shop case provides a realistic view of technology adoption and implementation needs for this niche...|$|R
