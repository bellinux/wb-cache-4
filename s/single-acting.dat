25|$|In 1903 the 1846 {{engine was}} rebuilt {{as a simple}} <b>single-acting</b> engine and thus became the current number 2 engine. Both engines then {{continued}} in regular use until the 1950s, when {{the state of the}} chimney forced the removal of the top 36 feet (11 m). The reduced height chimney was unable to provide sufficient draught for the boiler, and it proved cheaper to retire the steam engines and install electric pumps.|$|E
25|$|Number 1 engine, {{built by}} Boulton and Watt in 1812 and rebuilt as a Cornish engine in the 1840s, is a <b>single-acting,</b> {{condensing}} engine with a bore of 42.25 inches (1073mm), {{a stroke of}} 7 feet (2134mm) and indicated power of 38.6 horsepower (28.8kW). It drives a 30-inch (762mm) lift pump capable of lifting 2274lb (1031kg), or approximately one ton of water, per stroke, {{at a rate of}} 11 strokes a minute.|$|E
25|$|Number 2 engine, {{built by}} Harvey and Co. of Hayle in 1846 as a {{double-acting}} Sims patent combined cylinder engine and rebuilt in 1903 to a Cornish Engine, is a <b>single-acting,</b> condensing engine with a bore of 42 inches (1067mm), {{a stroke of}} 7 feet 8 inches (2337mm) and indicated power of 42 horsepower (31kW). It drives a 30-inch (762mm) force pump capable of lifting 2235 pounds (1014kg), or approximately one ton of water, per stroke, {{at a rate of}} 10.2 strokes a minute.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was an equal span pusher biplane with a monoplane tailplane and an elevator mounted on booms {{forward of the}} wings, the elevator being extended outboard of the supporting booms. <b>Single-acting</b> ailerons were fitted to both upper and lower wings. The Green engined aircraft had a single rudder mounted underneath the tailplane, while Grace's E.N.V. engined example had an additional rudder mounted above it. The undercarriage was simpler than Farman's design, and consisted {{of a pair of}} wheels mounted on an axle attached to the skids: supplementary tailskids were attached {{to the ends of the}} tail booms.|$|E
25|$|Sisu was a {{diesel-electric}} icebreaker with a {{power plant}} consisting of three eight-cylinder Atlas Polar <b>single-acting</b> two-stroke diesel engines, each rated at 1,600hp in continuous operation, directly coupled to 1,070kVA Strömberg generators. The diesel-driven direct current (DC) double-armature generators supplied electricity to three 1,335hp Strömberg DC motors, two driving fixed-pitch propellers in the stern and the third coupled to a single forward-facing propeller in the bow, through a Ward Leonard drive system. In addition, Sisu had three 200hp auxiliary diesel generators which provided electricity for other onboard consumers as well as excitation current for the main generators.|$|E
25|$|Initial trials {{revealed}} {{a lack of}} longitudinal control, and the <b>single-acting</b> ailerons caused problems when taxying downwind, so the two prototype were fitted with lengths of bungee cord attached to control horns on the upper aileron surface to return the aileron to the neutral position. This only produced a marginal improvement, so ailerons were then added to the lower wings, these being fitted to all the aircraft built apart from the two prototypes. These were linked by cables to the upper ailerons, and the bungee cord to return the ailerons was rigged between {{the top of the}} rear interplane struts and the lower ailerons.|$|E
25|$|Moskva was a {{diesel-electric}} icebreaker with a {{power plant}} consisting of eight 9-cylinder Wärtsilä-Sulzer 9MH51 <b>single-acting</b> two-stroke diesel engines, each of which was rated at 3,250hp in continuous operation but capable of 10% overload for one hour at a time. The main engines were directly coupled to Siemens direct current (DC) generators that supplied electricity to propulsion motors through an applied Ward Leonard drive system. Normally, four generators were connected to the tandem electric motor driving the centerline propeller shaft and two generators to the propulsion motors driving the wing shafts, but the system allowed connecting two generators from the center circuit to either port or starboard circuit and vice versa in case of engine failure.|$|E
2500|$|Dominion Monarch was the world's most {{powerful}} motor liner. She was powered by four William Doxford & Sons five-cylinder two-stroke <b>single-acting</b> diesel engines, each of [...] bore by [...] stroke. Two engines were built by Swan Hunter and two under licence by Sunderland Forge. The engines were the largest that Doxford's had constructed. Together {{they gave her}} a rating of 5,056 NHP or 32,000 bhp, {{a top speed of}} [...] and cruising speed of [...] at an engine speed of 123 rpm.|$|E
2500|$|The lower wings were parallel-chord, {{while the}} upper wings {{increased}} in chord from the centre section to the wingtips. The two prototype aircraft had ailerons {{on the upper}} wing only. These were <b>single-acting,</b> relying on the airflow to maintain them in a neutral position unless pulled downwards by using the flight controls. [...] The interplane struts were steel tubing with wood fairings to produce a streamline section. [...] The wings could be swung out from the pilot's position, {{by means of a}} hand-winch in the cockpit, locking being accomplished by means of a splined and threaded spigot in the forward spar, locked and unlocked by a quarter-turn in a similar manner to the breech of a field-gun. [...] In the folded position the wings were supported by a transverse shaft mounted in front of the tailplane: this was rotated by a lever in the cockpit so that its upturned ends engaged with slots on the interplane struts in order to lock the wings in the folded position.|$|E
2500|$|The Boxkite was a two-bay biplane with an {{elevator}} carried on booms {{in front of}} the wings and [...] an empennage consisting of a pair of fixed horizontal stabilisers, the upper bearing {{an elevator}}, and a pair of rudders carried on booms behind the wing. There were no fixed vertical surfaces. [...] Lateral control was effected by ailerons on both upper and lower wings. These were <b>single-acting,</b> the control cables arranged to pull them down only, relying on the airflow to return them to the neutral position. [...] The wings and [...] fixed rear horizontal surfaces were covered by a single layer of fabric: the other surfaces were covered on both sides. Power was usually provided by a [...] Gnome rotary engine, although other engines were also used. [...] This was mounted on a pair of substantial wooden beams mounted above the lower wing: these continued forward to carry the seats, which were arranged in tandem, with the pilot sitting over {{the leading edge of the}} wing. [...] The undercarriage consisted of a pair of long skids, each bearing a pair of wheels sprung by bungee cords, and a single sprung tailskid mounted below the leading edge of the lower tailplane.|$|E
50|$|Another {{classification}} is <b>single-acting</b> presses versus double- (seldom triple) acting presses. <b>Single-acting</b> presses {{have one}} single ram. Double-acting presses have a subdivided ram, to manage, for example, blank holding (to avoid wrinkles) with one ram segment and the forming operation {{with the second}} ram segment.|$|E

50|$|A <b>single-acting</b> {{cylinder}} in a {{reciprocating engine}} is a cylinder {{in which the}} working fluid acts {{on one side of}} the piston only. A <b>single-acting</b> cylinder relies on the load, springs, other cylinders, or the momentum of a flywheel, to push the piston back in the other direction. <b>Single-acting</b> cylinders are found in most kinds of reciprocating engine. They are almost universal in internal combustion engines (e.g. petrol and diesel engines) and are also used in many external combustion engines such as Stirling engines and some steam engines. They are also found in pumps and hydraulic rams.|$|E

50|$|Unusually for a steam engine, but {{somewhat}} advantageously for a <b>single-acting</b> engine, the Peache was a desaxe engine. By slightly offsetting the crankshaft and piston axis, the crosshead forces remained {{towards the}} rear of the engine, throughout the operating cycle. Like the <b>single-acting</b> principle itself, this constant direction of forces helped to reduce vibration and wear.|$|E

50|$|In the {{conventional}} double-acting engine, residual steam {{was trapped in}} the exhausting cylinder after the valve closed and compressed. This compressed steam has a cushioning effect and acts to brake the piston {{at the end of}} stroke. In the <b>single-acting</b> engine there is no similar effect {{at the end of the}} power stroke. This had previously been a limitation on the operating speed of <b>single-acting</b> engines.|$|E

50|$|Small {{models and}} toys often use <b>single-acting</b> {{cylinders}} for the above reason {{but also to}} reduce manufacturing costs.|$|E
50|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines soon switched to <b>single-acting</b> cylinders. This was for two reasons: {{as for the}} high-speed steam engine, the high force on each piston and its connecting rod {{was so great that}} it placed large demands upon the bearings. A <b>single-acting</b> piston, where the direction of the forces was consistently compressive along the connecting rod, allowed for tighter bearing clearances. Secondly the need for large valve areas to provide good gas flow, whilst requiring a small volume for the combustion chamber so as to provide good compression, monopolised the space available in the cylinder head. Lenoir's steam engine-derived cylinder was inadequate for the petrol engine and so a new design, based around poppet valves and a <b>single-acting</b> trunk piston appeared instead.|$|E
