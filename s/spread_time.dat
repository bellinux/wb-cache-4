40|$|The {{asynchronous}} push&pull protocol, {{a randomized}} distributed algorithm for spreading a rumour in a graph G, works as follows. Independent Poisson clocks of rate 1 {{are associated with}} the vertices of G. Initially, one vertex of G knows the rumour. Whenever the clock of a vertex x rings, it calls a random neighbour y: if x knows the rumour and y does not, then x tells y the rumour (a push operation), and if x does not know the rumour and y knows it, y tells x the rumour (a pull operation). The average <b>spread</b> <b>time</b> of G is the expected time it takes for all vertices to know the rumour, and the guaranteed <b>spread</b> <b>time</b> of G is the smallest time t such that with probability at least 1 - 1 /n, after time t all vertices know the rumour. The synchronous variant of this protocol, in which each clock rings precisely at times 1, 2, [...] ., has been studied extensively. We prove the following results for any n-vertex graph: In either version, the average <b>spread</b> <b>time</b> is at most linear even if only the pull operation is used, and the guaranteed <b>spread</b> <b>time</b> is within a logarithmic factor of the average <b>spread</b> <b>time,</b> so it is O(n n). In the asynchronous version, both the average and guaranteed spread times are Ω(n). We give examples of graphs illustrating that these bounds are best possible up to constant factors. We also prove theoretical relationships between the guaranteed spread times in the two versions. Firstly, in all graphs the guaranteed <b>spread</b> <b>time</b> in the asynchronous version is within an O(n) factor of that in the synchronous version, and this is tight. Next, we find examples of graphs whose asynchronous spread times are logarithmic, but the synchronous versions are polynomially large.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} detecting {{the source of a}} rumor (information diffusion) in a network based on observations about which set of nodes posses the rumor. In a recent work [10] by the authors, this question was introduced and studied. The authors proposed rumor centrality as an estimator for de-tecting the source. They establish it to be the maximum likelihood estimator with respect to the popular Susceptible Infected (SI) model with exponen-tial <b>spreading</b> <b>time</b> for regular trees. They showed that as the size of infected graph increases, for a line (2 -regular tree) graph, the probability of source detection goes to 0 while for d-regular trees with d ≥ 3 the probability of detection, say αd, remains bounded away from 0 and is less than 1 / 2. Their results, however stop short of providing insights for the heterogeneous setting such as irregular trees or the SI model with non-exponential <b>spreading</b> <b>times.</b> This paper overcomes this limitation and establishes the effectiveness of rumor centrality for source detection for generic random trees and the SI model with a generic <b>spreading</b> <b>time</b> distribution. The key result is an inter-esting connection between a multi-type continuous time branching processes (an equivalent representation of a generalized Polya’s urn, cf. [1]) and the effectiveness of rumor centrality. Through this, it is possible to quantify the detection probability precisely. As a consequence, we recover all the results of [10] as a special case and more importantly, we obtain a variety of results establishing the universality of rumor centrality in the context of tree-like graphs and the SI model with a generic <b>spreading</b> <b>time</b> distribution...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe are {{studying}} the practicality of news dissemination over a Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) in an urban area. The target application is {{the distribution of the}} electronic version of a newspaper in a large city. Therefore, although strict time constraints do not apply, spreading the information should be achieved within a reasonable delay. Two performance metrics, the <b>spreading</b> <b>time</b> and the message delay, are considered. The message delay is the delay required to transmit content from a mobile node to another node, while the <b>spreading</b> <b>time</b> is the delay needed for the content to spread over a part of the network. Firstly, our goal is to increase our understanding of the performance of a simple DTN environment when content is distributed solely through inter-contact of mobile nodes. We contribute both the closed-form expression and the asymptotic expression of the expected message delay to the literature when considering the probability of interest/acceptance for a given content in each contact. The asymptotic expression provides the insights on the efficient ways for improving the expected message delay {{in the case of an}} area with low or high density of mobile nodes. We also show a relationship between the expected message delay and the expected <b>spreading</b> <b>time</b> in such environment. Secondly, if the delay is found to be excessive, we suggest the deployment of some data kiosks in the environment to better support the dissemination of content. Data kiosks are simple devices that receive content directly from the source, usually using wired or cellular networks. A key issue when designing efficiently such network is to determine the number of data kiosks required to satisfy a performance target. We investigate both an upper bound and a lower bound of the number of data kiosks to distribute the content over a geographical area within an expected <b>spreading</b> <b>time</b> objective. We also show the important property that those bounds scale linearly with the contact rates between a mobile node and a data kiosk. Finally, we consider the question of the optimal location of data kiosks in a more realistic scenario where users move along a transportation system (like a subway or suburban train) that connects several regions. We provide an analysis used to decide which subway stop should host a data kiosk to optimize the <b>spreading</b> <b>time.</b> These findings support the view that the optimal location of data kiosks is influenced not only by the conditions of a region but also by the target number of mobile users that should receive the content.

This approach was combined with analyses of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) epidemiologic-historical background and HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in different countries. Methods: The HCV gene sequences of 131 genotype 1 b (HCV- 1 b) strains from Japan, 38 HCV- 1 a strains from the United States, 33 HCV- 1 b strains from Spain, 27 HCV- 3 a strains from the former Soviet Union (FSU), 47 HCV- 4 a strains from Egypt, 25 HCV- 5 a strains from South Africa, and 24 HCV- 6 a strains from Hong Kong isolated {{in this study and}} previous studies were analyzed. Results: The coalescent analysis indicated that a transition from constant size to rapid exponential growth (<b>spread</b> <b>time)</b> occurred in Japan in the 1920 s (HCV- 1 b), but not until the 1940 s for the same genotype in Spain and other European countries. The <b>spread</b> <b>time</b> of HCV- 1 a in the United States was estimated to be in the 1960 s; HCV- 3 a in the FSU, HCV- 5 a in South Africa, and HCV- 6 a in Hong Kong in the 1960 s, mid- 1950 s, and late 1970 s, respectively. Three different linear progression curves were determined by analysis of the relationship between HCV seroprevalence and HCC mortality in different geographic regions; a steep ascent indicated the greatest progression to HCC in Japan, a near horizontal line indicated the least progression in the United States and the FSU, and an intermediate slope was observed in Europe. Conclusions: These findings strongly suggest that the initial <b>spread</b> <b>time</b> of HCV is associated with the progression dynamics of HCC in each area, irrespective of genotype. © 2006 by the American Gastroenterological Association Institute. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{standard}} randomized (push-pull) rumor spreading, nodes {{communicate in}} synchronized rounds. In each round every node contacts a random neighbor {{in order to}} exchange the rumor (i. e., either push the rumor to its neighbor or pull it from the neighbor). A natural asynchronous variant of this algorithm is one where each node has an independent Poisson clock with rate 1, and every node contacts a random neighbor whenever its clock ticks. This asynchronous variant is arguably a more realistic model in various settings, including message broadcasting in communication networks, and information dissemination in social networks. In this paper we study how asynchrony affects the rumor <b>spreading</b> <b>time,</b> that is, the time before a rumor originated at a single node spreads to all nodes in the graph. Our first result states that the asynchronous push-pull rumor <b>spreading</b> <b>time</b> is asymptotically bounded by the standard synchronous time. Precisely, we show that for any graph G on n nodes, where the synchronous push-pull protocol informs all nodes within T (G) rounds with high probability, the asynchronous protocol needs at most time O(T (G) + log n) to inform all nodes with high probability. On the other hand, we show that the expected synchronous push-pull rumor <b>spreading</b> <b>time</b> is bounded by O(√ n) times the expected asynchronous time. These results improve upon the bounds for both directions shown recently by Acan et al. (PODC 2015). An interesting implication of our first result is that in regular graphs, the weaker push-only variant of synchronous rumor spreading has the same asymptotic performance as the synchronous push-pull algorithm...|$|R

40|$|The {{context of}} this work is the well studied {{dissemination}} of information in large scale distributed networks through pairwise interactions. This problem, originally called rumor mongering, and then rumor spreading has mainly been investigated in the synchronous model. This model relies {{on the assumption that}} all the nodes of the network act in synchrony, that is, at each round of the protocol, each node is allowed to contact a random neighbor. In this paper, we drop this assumption under the argument that it is not realistic in large scale systems. We thus consider the asynchronous variant, where at random times, nodes successively interact by pairs exchanging their information on the rumor. In a previous paper, we performed a study {{of the total number of}} interactions needed for all the nodes of the network to discover the rumor. While most of the existing results involve huge constants that do not allow us to compare different protocols, we provided a thorough analysis of the distribution of this total number of interactions together with its asymptotic behavior. In this paper we extend this discrete-time analysis by solving a conjecture proposed previously and we consider the continuous-time case, where a Poisson process is associated to each node to determine the instants at which interactions occur. The rumor <b>spreading</b> <b>time</b> is thus more realistic since it is the real time needed for all the nodes of the network to discover the rumor. Once again, as most of the existing results involve huge constants, we provide tight bound and equivalent of the complementary distribution of the rumor <b>spreading</b> <b>time.</b> We also give the exact asymptotic behavior of the complementary distribution of the rumor <b>spreading</b> <b>time</b> around its expected value when the number of nodes tends to infinity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Transmitted {{reference}} (TR) modulation schemes, initially {{proposed for}} spread spectrums in 1920 ’s, have regained {{popularity in the}} context of ultra wideband (UWB) communications, where accurate channel estimation is a challenging task. Conventional RAKE receivers can capture {{only a fraction of the}} received signal energy under practical implementation and channel estimation requirements. Transmit reference and autocorrelation receivers can efficiently collect energy from all the received multi path components without explicit channel estimation and with a simpler structure. Performance analysis of these schemes is investigated herein and verified via simulations. UWB systems are likely to be employed in wireless indoor environments with different channel characteristics for different locations. Since the length of the integration interval is an important design parameter with respect to the achievable performance, a new algorithm for adaptive adjustment of integration interval parameter is proposed in the autocorrelation receivers. According to this method, integration time is restricted to those intervals with more received signal components. This time is almost equal the multi path delay <b>spread</b> <b>time</b> of channel, in other words, by using the adaptive algorithm, the effect of the added noise to the received signal in the autocorrelation receiver is suppressed. Simulations are performed to evaluate the error performance of the proposed algorithm in indoor UWB standard channels and on different transmitted reference schemes, also at higher data rates, in the present of ISI, we notice performance improvements.

Its stability, structure, and dynamical evolution are investigated, and it is concluded that its <b>spreading</b> <b>time</b> is short (about ~ 100 yr); the moon is formed molten, or partially molten; the moon's initial orbit lies in the earth's equatorial plane; and {{only a small fraction of}} the disk mass is lost in a wind, although this may represent a substantial fraction of volatiles. Most of these conclusions are independent of how the disk was formed, e. g., from a giant impact...|$|R
