40|$|Eastern {{enlargement}} {{is generally}} assumed {{not to take}} place before the year 2000, with a first accession of {{at least some of}} the 10 Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) that have association agreements with the European Union (EU). In spite of uncertainties about the time and scope of enlargement, it is not premature to start reflecting on EU <b>structural</b> <b>assistance</b> to CEECs. One reason is that all external assistance has - wanted or not - a regional impact as it is allocated to certain locations and therefore requires some decisions on priority regions and activities. Second, preaccession aid to CEECs should be designed in a way that allows a smooth switch-over from existing funds (such as PHARE) to the Structural Funds in order to facilitate accession. This means not only to adjust pre-accession aid to the Structural Funds, but may also require - in the opposite direction - to prepare the Structural Funds for the CEECs. Whatever the modalities of transition will be, it is clear that sooner or later there will have to be an equal treatment of old and new Member States after a certain period. This paper will proceed as follows. After summarising briefly the national development gap of the CEECs relative to the EU (section 2), a more comprehensive view will be taken on the CEECs’ regions (section 3).

Even though, not all aspects of the Irish experience are likely to be equally relevant to Central and Eastern European policy makers and analysts, it is important to learn the essentials of the Irish case. Presumably one of the most important lessons, considering the new challenges of the Central and Eastern European Countries, is that the active structural policy pursued was decisively coupled with sound macroeconomic policies.

40|$|After {{summarising}} briefly {{the national}} development gap of the CEECs {{relative to the}} EU (section 2), a more comprehensive view is taken on the CEECs' regions (section 3). Section 4 presents some theoretical considerations on whether priority {{should be given to}} national or to regional development policy. Section 5 discusses several implications for EU <b>structural</b> <b>assistance.</b> Section 6 summarises and concludes. II/ 039 / 97 -ENSummary and conclusions The gap of national development compared to the EU 15 average income as measured by income per capita in 1993 was considerable, the 10 associated CEECs' average being at 29 % of EU 15 average. Regional policies and the regions in CEECs are characterised by a missing level of regional administration and statistics. Regional policy in the socialist era was essentially the outcome of national sectoral plans and can broadly be categorised into two country groups: A first group of countries, including Bulgaria, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary and Poland, did not undertake major efforts to reduce inter-regional disparities and allocated industries - although with several exceptions - according to traditional locations. A second group of countries, among which Czechoslovakia, Romania and Slovenia, tried to allocate industries to all regions of the country, in this way creating intra-regional differences and locations that have problems to survive in a competitive environment. Although economic transition caused polarisation effects, an implemented regional policy can hardly be found in any of these countries due to disputes over ministerial responsibilities, the need to reform territorial administrative structures and the lack of financial resources. A major regional orientation can only be found in some countries with active labour market policies for problem regions {{as well as in the}} context of programmes on cross-border co-operation. Describing regional disparities in the CEECs during the transformation process is limited by insufficient regional data. Unemployment rates in Romania and the Czech Republic vary only little across the regions, while there are major differences within Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Albania. Classifying the regions in the four Visegrad countries according to sectoral employment shares in 1991 above the national average suggests a typology of regions as mono-structural problem regions, lagging regions with a development potential and growth poles. This typology of regions is essentially in line with the ones frequently applied in western countries and gives a first idea of the future objectives of regional policies in the CEECs: diversification of the economic structure in mono-structural problem regions, development of the locational advantages in regions with a development potential and removal of bottlenecks in the growth poles. Given the financial constraints of implementing EU <b>structural</b> <b>assistance</b> in CEECs, one of the most crucial decisions will be on the regional allocation of funds, in particular whether to promote primarily national or regional development because a trade-off between national and regional development policy could force governments to decide whether to prioritise either national development or regional equality. The institutional setting in the CEECs' regions, i. e. the lack of regional administration and statistics, as well as subsidiarity considerations suggest not to have <b>structural</b> <b>assistance</b> carried out directly on a regional level. Implications for EU <b>structural</b> <b>assistance</b> bringing together PHARE and Structural Funds assistance were discussed following the four operating principles that were introduced for the reform of the Structural Funds in 1988 : concentration, partnership, programming and additionality. In respect to concentration, no new objective for countries in economic transformation should be introduced because the differences in regional problems are of a quantitative dimension rather than of a qualitative one. The basic problem in applying the principle of partnership would be a lack of administrative and social partners at the regional level, but could be an important leverage for democratisation and institution-building at the national level. While programming should in general be no problem at the national level, there might be insufficient information to programme the regional allocation of funds. In the course of enlargement, an option for reform could be to give Member States access either to a Cohesion Fund-like scheme or to a Structural Funds-like scheme in order to allow for a better targeting of projects and instruments. The Cohesion Fund-like scheme would provide for the real convergence of poorer Member States towards the Union, based on a national development programme, while the Structural Funds-like scheme would provide for social and regional cohesion in the wealthier Member States. There might be some specific problems for CEECs to comply with the additionality principle and to avoid excessive deficits at the same time. The main reason is that the budgets of the CEECs still face some risks for revenues and expenditures. Therefore, maintaining structural expenditure at a stable level without allowing for temporary public deficits will be difficult for CEECs. To sum up, several arguments suggest not to target EU <b>structural</b> <b>assistance</b> exclusively at the reduction of regional disparities within CEECs. Doing so would not only face problems due to missing administrations and statistics at the regional level, but might also be at the expense of national economic growth and extend the process of catching-up. A Cohesion Fund-like scheme could be developed into an adequate instrument for assisting the real convergence of cohesion countries towards the Union. central europe, eastern europe, economic analysis, eu funds...|$|E

In particular, we address the various modes of access to production factors, such as capital, specific inputs and know-how, as reasons for the varied development of Romanian dairy supply chains and its respective actors (farmers, processors). The paper draws on results from a recent study supported by the World Bank. The findings are based on semi-structured telephone and face-to-face interviews conducted in January-March 2009. The interviews indicate that large and prosperous dairy chains have better access to all production factors, which allows the strengthening of their relationships, especially in the upstream stages (farmers), and supports their competitive advantages in the domestic market. Many barriers exist in the domestic market, particularly for small and medium-sized dairy chains, which hampers their potential exploitation of particular stages in the chain. In the same way the findings indicate that virtually only large companies and farms benefit from public support regarding access to capital (EU-funding, governmental programs) and know-how (extension service). vertical coordination, <b>structural</b> change, farm <b>assistance,</b> Romania, dairy., Agricultural and Food Policy, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|R

It finds that much of the protection proposed for the major emissions-intensive industries is unnecessary or counter-productive, and would delay the structural adjustment required to move to a lower carbon economy. Fears that carbon pricing will lead to large-scale job losses or cost increases are not supported by the evidence, and have led to irrational and costly policy. The adjustments emissions-intensive industries need to make are manageable and inevitable if we are ultimately to constrain carbon emissions. Compared to other economic reforms, such as reduction in tariff protection over the 1980 s and 1990 s, a carbon price requires relatively little <b>structural</b> adjustment. Industry <b>assistance</b> should be more targeted to prevent a few cases of truly perverse outcomes. Assistance should also be provided directly to affected communities. Other assistance should be minimised to encourage the Australian economy to adapt to be internationally competitive in a carbon-constrained world.   Image: pfala / Flick...|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} {{proportion of}} newly diagnosed AIDS cases is being reported among African American urban women. Recent research regarding the psychosocial and behavioral {{impact of a}} mother's HIV status on her uninfected {{children as well as}} a growing body of clinical evidence suggest that these children are extremely vulnerable and at risk for problems in psychosocial adjustment. The present paper reports the results of research designed to examine the pathways by which a mother's HIV-positive status affects the psychosocial adjustment of her uninfected school-age child. The principal predictor variables of the model are family sociodemographic characteristics, social support available to mother and child, HIV-related symptom distress in the mother, coping strategies of both mother and child, emotional distress of the mother, and quality of the parent-child relationship. The dependent variable is the psychosocial adjustment of the child. Data were collected on 147 mother-child dyads using standardized questionnaires and personal interviews. Eighty-six percent of the mothers were African American and over 96 % were on public <b>assistance.</b> <b>Structural</b> equation modeling was used to test the proposed model of mother-child coping and adjustment. After adding three paths, the model had a good fit to the data (comparative fit INDEX= 0. 94; root mean square estimate of ERROR= 0. 06). Five model constructs accounted for 36 % of the variance in child adjustment. The constructs in order of importance were maternal HIV-associated stressors, maternal emotional distress, child social support, child coping, and quality of parent-child relationship.

40|$|BackgroundBreastfeeding {{rates are}} lower among infants living {{in rural areas}} of the United States, yet there are limited data on whether {{hospital}} breastfeeding support differs between rural and urban areas. ObjectiveThis study aimed to describe whether maternity care practices supportive of breastfeeding vary by level of urbanization. MethodsWe linked data from the 2007, 2009, and 2011 Maternity Practices in Infant Nutrition and Care (mPINC) surveys with Rural-Urban Continuum Codes to categorize hospital counties as metropolitan urbanized, nonmetropolitan urbanized, less urbanized, and thinly populated. ResultsFrom 2007 to 2011, the average hospital mPINC score, a composite quality score ranging from 0 to 100, increased from 64 to 71 in metropolitan urbanized counties and from 54 to 65 in thinly populated areas. Scores were lowest in thinly populated counties in 2007 and 2009 and in less urbanized counties in 2011. Examination of 2011 mPINC scores by 7 domains of care revealed that hospitals in less urbanized counties had lower scores than those in metropolitan urbanized counties for feeding of breastfed infants, breastfeeding assistance, staff training, and structural and organizational aspects of care delivery; for 3 of these practices, scores were 10 or more points lower 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 dbreastfeeding <b>assistance,</b> <b>structural</b> and organizational aspects of care, and staff training. In contrast, hospitals in thinly populated areas had higher scores than in metropolitan areas for mother 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 cinfant contact and facility discharge care; differences were less than 10 points. ConclusionInterventions that specifically target rural hospitals may reduce the gap in access to hospital maternity care practices supportive of breastfeeding by population density.
