Base represents the current fleet <b>emission</b> regulation <b>target</b> in place [7], i.e. only a 95 gCO 2 /km target from 2021. A second Mid scenario has tighter targets based on [34]: 85 gCO 2 /km in 2025, 75 gCO 2 /km in 2030 and 25 gCO 2 /km in 2050). Within the PTTMAM, manufacturers are represented as one conglomerate market agent. The <b>specific</b> <b>emission</b> <b>target</b> is calculated as per the regulations, based on average vehicle mass {{and the target}} as given.

Thus, excess emissions are determined from the difference between this and the <b>specific</b> <b>target</b> <b>emissions,</b> and manufacturers are penalised according to the regulations (which is up to € 95 per gCO 2 /km).|$|R

First results emphasize the crucial impact of the market structure (i. e. market concentration rates, cost structures, and particularly the heterogeneity of the vehicle manufacturers) on the relative favourability.

FAIR is an interactive - scanner-type - computer model to quantitatively explore {{a range of}} alternative climate policy options for international differentiation of future commitments and link these to targets for global climate protection. The model includes three different approaches for evaluating international commitment regimes: 1) Increasing participation: in this mode the number of parties involved and their level of commitment gradually increase according to participation and differentiation rules, such as per- capita income, per capita emissions, or contribution to global warming. 2) Convergence: in this mode all parties participate in the burden-sharing regime, with emission rights converging to equal per capita levels over time. 3) Triptych: different burden sharing rules are applied for different sectors (e. g. convergence of per capita emissions in the domestic sector, efficiency and de-carbonisation targets for the industry sector and the power generation sector). The first two modes are representatives of top-down methodologies, so from global emission ceilings to regional emission budgets, whereas the triptych approach is more bottom-up in character, although it can be combined with <b>specific</b> <b>emission</b> <b>targets</b> (as illustrated {{in the case of}} the EU).

40|$|Several {{important}} issues {{need to be}} addressed to make avoided deforestation (AD) a feasible option for climate change policy. Traditional questions associated with land-based sequestration options have largely been discussed in terms of project-based approaches to carbon sequestration. For country-level commitments these concepts remain important, but we argue in this paper that they can and should be addressed differently. In order to address AD, it is useful to begin by outlining the international climate control regimes under which AD could be included as an option. Two general alternatives are discussed - an arrangement that is a linear extension of the current Kyoto Protocol but that involves more countries with <b>specific</b> <b>emission</b> reduction <b>targets,</b> and an alternative expanded arrangement that requires that essentially all countries have greenhouse gas <b>emission</b> <b>targets.</b> We consider how AD would fit into these two general types of international agreements and address questions related to baselines, additionality, permanence, and leakage. We conclude that the key issues related to including deforestation in either of these arrangements revolve around measuring, monitoring (e. g., additionality), and the development of efficient incentives by countries to alter their land-use regimes. avoided deforestation, carbon, sequestration, credits, climate, warming...|$|R
40|$|Research {{on climate}} change has {{intensified}} {{on a global scale}} as evidence on the costs of global warming continues to accumulate. Confronted with such evidence, the European Union set in late 2006 an ambitious target to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, by 2020, to 20 % below the level of 1990; and invited the rest of the developed economies and the developing world to take part with the Kyoto Protocol. Turkey is the only country that appears in the Annex-I list of the United Nations' Rio Summit and yet an official target for CO 2 emission reductions has still not been established. Thus, as part of its accession negotiations with the EU, Turkey will likely to face significant pressures to introduce its national plan {{on climate change}} along with <b>specific</b> <b>emission</b> <b>targets</b> and the associated abatement policies. Given this motivation, we utilize a computable general equilibrium model for Turkey to study the economic impacts of the intended policy scenarios of compliance with the Kyoto Protocol and we report on the general equilibrium effects of various possible environmental abatement policies in Turkey over the period 2006 - 2020. The model is in the Walrasian tradition with 10 production sectors and a government operating within an open macroeconomy environment. It accommodates flexible production functions, imperfect substitution in trade and open unemployment. We focus on CO 2 emissions and distinguish various basic sources of gaseous pollution in the model. Our results suggest that the burden of imposing <b>emission</b> control <b>targets</b> and the implied abatement costs could be quite high, {{and that there is a}} need to finance the expanded abatement investments from scarce domestic resources. Policies for environmental abatement via carbon and/or increased energy taxes further suffer from very adverse employment effects.

To our knowledge we {{are the first to}} apply a forward-looking model with endogenous prices for fossil fuels in analysis of <b>specific</b> CO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>targets,</b> under different assumptions concerning OPEC behaviour. We calculate both the time-path of the international permit prices needed for the Kyoto targets as well as the implications through reduced demand and lower producer prices for fossil fuels. Irrespective of the assumption concerning OPEC behaviour, the permit price has to rise for the first 30 to 40 years in order to fulfil the Kyoto targets in Annex B. The permit price can be reduced substantially, dependent on when a backstop technology starts to replace oil. The Kyoto targets will result in a loss of petroleum wealth for oil and gas producers by 15 to 20 % as long as OPEC acts as a cartel. If the developing countries are included in the Protocol, OPEC will lose much more of their wealth.

40|$|With the {{majority}} of the world population residing in urban areas, attempts to monitor and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions must necessarily center on cities. However, existing carbon dioxide observation networks are ill-equipped to resolve the <b>specific</b> intra-city <b>emission</b> phenomena <b>targeted</b> by regulation. Here we describe the design and implementation of the BErkeley Atmospheric CO 2 Observation Network (BEACO 2 N), a distributed CO 2 monitoring instrument that utilizes low-cost technology to achieve unprecedented spatial density throughout and around the city of Oakland, California. We characterize the network in terms of four performance parameters – cost, reliability, precision, and systematic uncertainty – and find the BEACO 2 N approach to be sufficiently cost-effective and reliable while nonetheless providing high-quality atmospheric observations. First results from the initial installation successfully capture hourly, daily, and seasonal CO 2 signals relevant to urban environments on spatial scales that cannot be accurately represented by atmospheric transport models alone, demonstrating the utility of high-resolution surface networks in urban greenhouse gas monitoring efforts...|$|R
40|$|Forests can {{contribute}} to the reduction of carbon emissions by storing carbon in standing biomass or in products made of wood. Alternatively, harvested biomass can be used as bioenergy and replace fossil fuels. This thesis analyses the cost-efficiency of introducing forest carbon sequestration (FCS) into EU climate policy. Quantification of the potential and cost of FCS is important from a policy perspective, since this abatement method is being considered for inclusion in future EU climate policy. The quantification in this thesis is based on a mathematical optimisation model that aims to find the least costly combination of abatement strategies to reach a <b>specific</b> carbon <b>emission</b> <b>target.</b> The model covers the EU- 27 member states and can be applied in static and stochastic form (paper I) or dynamic form (paper II-IV). The main research questions investigated in the four separate studies are: i) The cost-efficiency and equity of including FCS in EU climate policy to 2020; ii) whether it is worth increasing FCS at the expense of bioenergy and forest products; iii) whether renewable energy forms (wind, hydro and photovoltaics) can compete with FCS as abatement methods; and iv) what the effects of climate change in terms of increased/reduced FCS will be during the current century and the accompanying implications on the cost of EU climate policy. The results, which can be useful for policy making, demonstrate cost efficiency in using FCS as an abatement method. However, this may be at the expense of reduced equity among EU member states, since forests are distributed unequally throughout the EU. Furthermore, FCS seems to be a more cost-efficient option in terms of carbon abatement than bioenergy and, to some extent, forest products. This is also the case when comparing the cost-efficiency with that of renewables, even on modelling renewables with endogenous technological change in the form of learning-by-doing. The results provide indications of increasing FCS during the current century due to climate change, in particular in northern Europe, where warmer seasons and more precipitation are expected. This would {{have a positive effect on}} the cost of reaching the <b>emissions</b> <b>target,</b> meaning that the overall abatement cost would be reduced...|$|R

40|$|While {{mitigation}} {{of carbon}} dioxide remains the principal climate target, addressing the so-called short-lived climate forcers including black carbon, tropospheric ozone, and methane offers significant co-benefits for near-term climate, human health, food security, and the cryosphere. Using IIASA’s GAINS (Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies) model we identified 14 <b>specific</b> <b>emission</b> control measures <b>targeting</b> black carbon and methane, an ozone precursor, that were selected because of their potential to reduce the rate of climate change over the next 20 – 40 years. Emission scenarios where these measures are applied globally by 2030 would reduce global warming potential from short-lived forcers about 60 %, methane emissions by up to 45 % and black carbon by over 70 % beyond baseline projections. These mitigation scenarios were used in climate simulations, performed with GIS and ECHAM models, and for health impact assessment. In addition to climate benefits (estimated reduction of global mean warming of ~ 0. 5 °C by 2050), the findings indicate substantial co-benefits for air quality and public health worldwide avoiding 0. 7 to 4. 7 million annual premature deaths from outdoor air pollution and increasing annual crop yields by 30 to 135 million metric tons due to ozone reductions in 2030 and beyond.

As the first tangible step to cope with global climate changes, countries adopted the UN brokered, ‘Kyoto Protocol,’ that was developed in 1997. Under the Protocol, the European Union (EU) and Japan established targets to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 8 % and 6 % respectively between 2008 and 2012 relative to 1990.
