25|$|Carrel {{was also}} {{interested}} in the phenomenon of senescence, or aging. He claimed that all cells continued to grow indefinitely, and this became a dominant view in the early 20th century. Carrel started an experiment on January 17, 1912, where he placed tissue cultured from an embryonic chicken heart in a <b>stoppered</b> Pyrex flask of his own design. He maintained the living culture for over 20 years with regular supplies of nutrient. This was longer than a chicken's normal lifespan. The experiment, which was conducted at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, attracted considerable popular and scientific attention.|$|E
25|$|The Perkin triangle, has means via {{a series}} of glass or Teflon taps to allows {{fractions}} to be isolated {{from the rest of}} the still, without the main body of the distillation being removed from either the vacuum or heat source, and thus can remain in a state of reflux. To do this, the sample is first isolated from the vacuum by means of the taps, the vacuum over the sample is then replaced with an inert gas (such as nitrogen or argon) and can then be <b>stoppered</b> and removed. A fresh collection vessel can then be added to the system, evacuated and linked back into the distillation system via the taps to collect a second fraction, and so on, until all fractions have been collected.|$|E
25|$|The {{death of}} Nick Adams {{has been cited}} in {{articles}} and books about Hollywood's unsolved mysteries along with speculation by a few of Adams' acquaintances he was murdered (according to author David Kulczyk, Adams was apparently planning to write a tell-all book revealing many sexual secrets of Hollywood names) and claims no trace of paraldehyde (a liquid sedative often given to alcoholics {{at the time and}} one of two drugs attributed to his death) was ever found in his home. However, Adams' brother Andrew had become a medical doctor and prescribed the sedative to him. Moreover, a story in the Los Angeles Times reported <b>stoppered</b> bottles with prescription labels were found in the medicine cabinet near the upstairs bedroom where Adams' body was discovered. Through the years, Adams' children offered speculation ranging from murder to accidental death, the latter perhaps caused by Roeder while trying to calm the actor's nerves with an unintentionally lethal combination of alcohol and prescription drugs (although the autopsy found no alcohol in Adams' blood). Actor Robert Conrad, Adams' best friend, has consistently maintained the death was accidental.|$|E

50|$|Wine <b>stoppers</b> vary in shapes, sizes, and materials. The three typical {{types are}} the cork wine <b>stopper,</b> rubber wine <b>stopper,</b> and plastic wine <b>stopper.</b> All these wine <b>stoppers</b> look very different, {{especially}} the top. The top part {{can be made}} from plastic, wood, or even precious metals and crystals. However the bottom part of the <b>stoppers</b> are primarily made of the above 3 typical materials, and newer versions of wine <b>stoppers</b> are made to expand in the wine glass to ensure a tighter seal.Some wine <b>stoppers</b> can be vacuum-sealed with a hand pump, to remove oxygen from the bottle, thereby extending the life of the wine by several days after opening the bottle.|$|R
2500|$|In 1974, {{the glow}} was {{explained}} by R. J. van Zee and A. U. Khan. A reaction with oxygen {{takes place at}} the surface of the solid (or liquid) phosphorus, forming the short-lived molecules HPO and [...] that both emit visible light. The reaction is slow and only very little of the intermediates are required to produce the luminescence, hence the extended time the glow continues in a <b>stoppered</b> jar.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was known}} from early {{times that the}} green glow emanating from white {{phosphorus}} would persist {{for a time in}} a <b>stoppered</b> jar, but then cease. Robert Boyle in the 1680s ascribed it to [...] "debilitation" [...] of the air; in fact, it is oxygen being consumed. By the 18th century, it was known that in pure oxygen, phosphorus does not glow at all; there is only a range of partial pressures at which it does. Heat can be applied to drive the reaction at higher pressures.|$|E
2500|$|The {{technique}} {{developed by}} Gaarder and Gran uses {{variations in the}} concentration of oxygen under different experimental conditions to infer gross primary production. [...] Typically, three identical transparent vessels are filled with sample water and <b>stoppered.</b> [...] The first is analysed immediately and {{used to determine the}} initial oxygen concentration; usually this is done by performing a Winkler titration. [...] The other two vessels are incubated, one each in under light and darkened. [...] After a fixed period of time, the experiment ends, and the oxygen concentration in both vessels is measured. [...] As photosynthesis has not taken place in the dark vessel, it provides a measure of ecosystem respiration. [...] The light vessel permits both photosynthesis and respiration, so provides a measure of net photosynthesis (i.e. oxygen production via photosynthesis subtract oxygen consumption by respiration). [...] Gross primary production is then obtained by adding oxygen consumption in the dark vessel to net oxygen production in the light vessel.|$|E

40|$|Mestrado Vinifera EuroMaster - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe {{objective}} of this work is to describe and compare colmated and non-colmated <b>stoppers</b> cork <b>stoppers,</b> regarding their differences in appearance (image analysis), structure (analysis with scanning electron microscopy- SEM), and mechanical behavior (compression test). For this study 75 natural cork <b>stoppers</b> were used and divided equally in 3 groups: (i) <b>stoppers</b> of superior class; (ii) <b>stoppers</b> of inferior class to be colmated; (iii) colmated <b>stoppers.</b> Image analysis techniques were applied on the surfaces of superior and inferior (pre-colmated) class of <b>stoppers,</b> to analyze their porosity. Porosity features showed differences between two classes: higher values of all features in the inferior class and lower in the superior quality class. Water absorption test performed on colmated and pre-colmated group of <b>stoppers</b> showed small differences between them: colmated <b>stoppers</b> absorbed less water (92. 1 %) than pre-colmated class (98. 8 %) and the same trend was found with dimensional variations (swelling) (lower swelling of colmated <b>stoppers</b> was reported). The behavior of the colmated and pre-colmated <b>stoppers</b> under compression performed in axial and radial direction was studied. Young’s modulus for compression in axial direction were 21. 2 MPa and 18. 4 MPa for colmated and pre-colmated group respectively, while the compression in radial direction was characterized with the range of force for the given deformation, with mean values of 147 kN and 135 kN for 1 mm deformation. Colmated <b>stoppers</b> were additionally analyzed by SEM, where the observations emphasis {{was given to the}} colmation material impregnation in the interior of the <b>stoppers.</b> Colmation material presence was mainly reported on the <b>stoppers</b> surface. It can be concluded that colmation process primarily improves the appearance of the <b>stopper,</b> covering successfully the undesirable surface pores, which is the main {{objective of}} the colmation...|$|R
