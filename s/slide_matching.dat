A circular sum of the Gabor feature elements belonging to the same scale is proposed to reduce the effect of rotation, while a <b>slide</b> <b>matching</b> of augmented scales is proposed to address the effect of scaling. The resulting feature vector is more compact, and the distance measure requires less computation. Experimental results indicate that this algorithm is effective for classifying texture images under different scales and rotations.

40|$|We {{present a}} general {{approach}} for automatically matching electronic slides to videos of corresponding presentations {{for use in}} distance learning and video proceedings of conferences. We deal with a large variety of videos, various frame compositions and color balances, arbitrary slides sequence and with dynamic cameras switching, pan, tilt and zoom. To achieve high accuracy, we develop a two-phases process with unsupervised scene background modelling. In the first phase, scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) keypoints are applied to frame to <b>slide</b> <b>matching,</b> under constraint projective transformation (constraint homography) using a random sample consensus (RANSAC). Successful first-phase matches are then used to automatically build a scene background model. In the second phase the background model {{is applied to the}} remaining unmatched frames to boost the matching performance for difficult cases such as wide field of view camera shots where the slide shows as {{a small portion of the}} frame. We also show that color correction is helpful when color-related similarity measures are used for identifying slides. We provide detailed quantitative experimentation results characterizing the effect of each part of our approach. The results show that our approach is robust and achieves high performance on matching slides to a number of videos with different styles. Categories and Subject Descriptor...|$|E

The observed intersequence homologies and internal duplications have led us to the proposal of an evolutionary scheme involving H 2 A, H 2 B and H 4 as deriving from a common ancestor.

40|$|A {{new design}} {{approach}} of a parallel distributed fuzzy sliding mode controller for nonlinear systems with mismatched time varying uncertainties {{is presented in}} this paper. The nonlinear system is approximated by the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy linear model. The approximation error between the nonlinear system and the fuzzy linear model is considered as {{one part of the}} uncertainty in the uncertain nonlinear system. The time varying uncertainties are assumed to have the format which enables the design of the coefficient matrix of the sliding function to satisfy a <b>sliding</b> coefficient <b>matching</b> condition. With the <b>sliding</b> coefficient <b>matching</b> condition satisfied, a parallel distributed fuzzy sliding mode controller (PDFSC) is designed. The stability and the sliding mode of the fuzzy sliding control system are guaranteed. Also, the nonlinear system is shown to be invariant on the sliding surface. Moreover, the chattering around the sliding surface in the sliding mode control can be reduced by the proposed design approach.

40|$|Triple {{immunofluorescence}} staining {{has recently}} been developed to simultaneously identify all muscle fibers on a single cryosection which is helpful for clinical and basic research, but it has disadvantages such as fast photobleaching and unclear outlines of muscle fibers. Triple immunoenzyme staining (TIE) is likely to avoid these disadvantages. In this study, we aimed to establish a sensitive and specific TIE technique to identify fiber types in normal, denervated, and reinnervated rat muscles, {{and to develop a}} systematic sampling method for muscle fiber quantification. Tibialis anterior and soleus from normal, denervated, and reinnervated Lewis rat hind limbs were used. Five consecutive cryosections were cut from each muscle, including one for TIE and four for single immunoenzyme staining (SIE). The TIE was performed using the polymerized reporter enzyme staining system for the first two antigens (A 4. 74 for MyHC-IIA, BA-F 8 for MyHC-I) and alkaline phosphatase staining system for the third antigen (BF-F 3 for MyHC-IIB), followed by corresponding detective systems and respective chromogens. The type of muscle fibers was quantified by systematic sampling at 12. 5 %, 25 %, 33 % and 50 % of all muscle fibers, and was compared with that acquired from counting all the fibers (100 %). All muscle fiber phenotypes, including pure and hybrid, could be simultaneously identified on a single TIE cryosection with clear outlines. The fiber types on TIE <b>slides</b> <b>matched</b> well with their respective counterpart on the consecutive SIE slides with a 95 % match rate. Systematic sampling of 12. 5 % fibers could represent the true fiber type distribution of the entire muscle section.

40|$|Abstract. Recognizing the {{presence}} of object classes in an image, or image clas-sification, has become an increasingly important topic of interest. Equally impor-tant, however, is also the capability to locate these object classes in the image. We consider in this paper an approach to these two related problems with {{the primary goal of}} minimizing the training requirements so as to allow for ease of adding new object classes, as opposed to approaches that favor training a suite of object-specific classifiers. To this end, we provide the analysis of an exemplar-based approach that leverages unsupervised clustering for classification purpose, and <b>sliding</b> window <b>matching</b> for localization. While such exemplar based ap-proach by itself is brittle towards intraclass and viewpoint variations, we achieve robustness by introducing a novel Conditional Random Field model that facili-tates a straightforward accept/reject decision of the localized object classes. Per-formance of our approach on the PASCAL Visual Object Challenge 2007 dataset demonstrates its efficacy. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Group {{comparison}} per se is {{a fundamental}} task in many scientific endeavours but is also the basis of any classifier. Contrast sets and emerging patterns contrast between groups of categorical data. Comparing groups of sequence data is a relevant task in many applications. We define Emerging Sequences (ESs) as subsequences that are frequent in sequences of one group and less frequent in the sequences of another, and thus distinguishing or contrasting sequences of different classes. There are two challenges to distinguish sequence classes: the extraction of ESs is not trivially efficient and only exact matches of sequences are considered. In our work we address those problems by a suffix tree-based framework and a <b>sliding</b> window <b>matching</b> mechanism for the distance metric between sequences. We propose a classifier for sequence data based on Emerging Sequences. Evaluating against two learning algorithms based on frequent subsequences and exact matching subsequences, the experiments on two datasets show that our similar ESs-based classification model outperforms the baseline approaches by up to 20 % in prediction accuracy...|$|R
40|$|The wide {{availability}} of mobile devices with embedded microphones opens up opportunities for new applications based on acoustic sensor localization (ASL). Among them, this paper highlights mobile device self-localization relying exclusively on acoustic signals, but with previous knowledge of reference signals and source positions. The problem {{of finding the}} sensor position is stated {{as a function of}} estimated times-of-flight (TOFs) or time-differences-of-flight (TDOFs) from the sound sources to the target microphone, and the main practical issues involved in TOF estimation are discussed. Least-squares ASL solutions are introduced, followed by other strategies inspired by sound source localization solutions: steered-response power, which improves localization accuracy, and a new region-based search, which alleviates complexity. A set of complementary techniques for further improvement of TOF/TDOF estimates are reviewed: <b>sliding</b> windows, <b>matching</b> pursuit, and TOF selection.

Forty-eight independent song sessions were analyzed using information theory techniques. The average length of the songs estimated by correlation analysis was approximately 100 units, with song sessions lasting from 300 to over 3100 units. Song entropy, a measure of structural constraints, was estimated using three different methodologies: (1) the independently identically distributed model, (2) a first-order Markov model, and (3) the nonparametric <b>sliding</b> window <b>match</b> length (SWML) method, as described by Suzuki et al. [(2006). “Information entropy of humpback whale song,” J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 119, 1849 – 1866]. The analysis finds that the song sequences of migrating Australian whales are consistent with the hierarchical structure proposed by Payne and McVay [(1971). “Songs of humpback whales,” Science 173, 587 – 597], and recently supported mathematically by Suzuki et al. (2006) for singers on the Hawaiian breeding grounds. Both the SWML entropy estimates and the song lengths for the Australian singers in 2003 were lower than that reported by Suzuki et al. (2006) for Hawaiian whales in 1976 – 1978; however, song redundancy did not differ between these two populations separated spatially and temporally.
