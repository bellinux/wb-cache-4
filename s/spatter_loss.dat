50|$|This type of {{electrode}} {{is generally}} produced with thin or medium coating thicknesses. When the coating is thin, a light amount of slag is formed on the welding beam and the <b>spatter</b> <b>loss</b> is high. On the other hand, the gap filling and vertical down welding capability {{as well as}} penetration of the weld obtained by this electrode is good. Since this electrode {{can be used in}} every position (particularly in vertical down), it has a wide range of applications in the ship building industry and in the welding of pipelines with a wall thickness of less than 12.5 mm. The cellulose that burns during welding forms a very good protective gaseous atmosphere.|$|E
40|$|The paper conveys new {{observations}} on arc stability in anti-phase synchronised synergic-pulsed twin-wire {{gas metal arc}} welding. Unlike the conventional understanding that arcs mutually affect each other, leading to arc instability, uneven weld bead, and excess <b>spatter</b> <b>loss,</b> etc., the present investigation suggests that dissimilar currents at lead and trail wires induce stability in the welding arcs, resulting in a considerable influence on weld microstructures, hardness, heat affected zone, and weld penetration-width ratio. The separation of arcs in time by anti-synchronisation and a synergic pulse can be better utilised to control arc instability when the current at the lead wire is more {{than that of the}} trail wire...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This study {{proposed}} preset pulsed {{magnetic field}} acting on process of the short circuiting transfer. It is a controlled horizontal magnetic field which attached {{at the very beginning}} of contact between the wire and the weld pool during welding. It was found that there exists optimum conditions of magnetic field with which preset {{pulsed magnetic field}} could accelerate the rupture of the liquid bridge and reduce the peak value of welding current in the period of short circuiting transfer. This lead to energy accumulation lowered at the last phase of the short circuiting transfer and <b>spatter</b> <b>loss</b> reduced resulting from explosive short circuit rupture, in the meantime, it could improve the regularity and stability of the short circuiting transfer as well as the weld shaping quality...|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} {{objective of}} this project {{was to determine the}} effect of varying current intensity and electrode coating composition upon the <b>spatter</b> <b>losses</b> and porosity of arc welds made by alternating current. This subject was suggested by the Welding Research Council of the Engineering Foundation, which is a clearing house for welding research in order to avoid duÂ­plication of work...|$|R
30|$|Arc {{stability}} {{is another important}} characteristic of arc welding. Arc {{stability is}} influenced by parameters such as arc power, metal transfer mode, and the regularity of the metal transfer mode (Ghosh et al. 2006). The emission of spatter during welding is the main negative result of poor arc stability; <b>spatter</b> creates material <b>losses,</b> extends cleaning time, and decreases weld bead quality (Suban and Tusek 2003).|$|R
