40|$|The use of Power Line Communication, PLC, as a {{communication}} solution for Automated Meter Reading, AMR, is popular by utilities in Sweden {{and other parts}} of the world due to demands of accurate and fast meter reading. However the use of the electrical grid as {{a communication}} medium is complex and sometimes problematic. This report handles some of the issues and problems that are important to understand when using the grid as a communications medium. Focus is mainly on investigating high frequency distortion in the Kristianstad power grid own by C 4 energi caused by a frequency converter. Measurements on site are done to investigate signal damping in the grid, different configurations for the frequency converter and signal strength of the PLC-system. The PLC-system that is used is an Echelon-system communicating on 75 kHz and 86 kHz. The results in this report can be applied to other systems communicating different frequencies in the CENELEC A-band. The results from the measurements show that the communication fails due to the frequency converter and that the noise level is too high. Tests done during the measurements show how some of the high frequency noise can be avoided by changing settings in the converter but this is not enough. An important result was that the problem can be to solved by changing the position for the PLC-concentrator further away from the converter another solution can be to add a filter to the frequency converter. COMSOL Simulations on connection cables are also done to analyze resistance due to skin effect at high frequency. The simulations are done to understand why <b>stranded</b> <b>cables</b> often works better then single <b>stranded</b> <b>cables.</b> The results from the simulations show clearly that it is better to use <b>stranded</b> <b>cables</b> then single <b>stranded</b> <b>cables.</b> The report is written in Swedish...|$|R

40|$|Cohesion of {{snow and}} its {{adhesion}} to cable surfaces are the decisive factors for wet-snow shedding from power-line cables. Knowing the adhesive strength of snow is essential to predict when snow will shed and what consequences it {{will have on the}} elements of the transmission line. It also appears to be a basic input for simulating wet-snow shedding. Snow adhesion depends on several parameters, among which snow liquid water content and density, and cable surface geometry were examined experimentally. In particular, the adhesion of wet-snow samples to flat surfaces of different roughness, and to <b>stranded</b> <b>cable</b> surfaces was examined in this study. Two series of experiments were conducted to measure shear adhesive strength as well as tensile adhesive strength of snow. Shear adhesive strength was measured with a centrifuge adhesion test device where a snow sample was placed on a beam, which was then rotated with increasing angular frequency until detachment, the angular frequency at detachment being proportional with shear adhesive force and strength. The tensile adhesive tests were carried out with a material test machine on a semi-spherical snow sample. The sample was compressed slowly at a constant speed until it reached a predefined compressive force limit, and then a tensile load was applied until the detachment of snow. The main observations showed that adhesion was strongest for a critical value of liquid water content, that shear adhesive strength was greatest on <b>stranded</b> <b>cable</b> surfaces, and that tensile adhesive strength was weaker on stranded than on flat cable surfaces...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Aluminum {{conductor}} steel-reinforced (ACSR) {{cable is}} {{a specific type of}} <b>stranded</b> <b>cable</b> typically used for electrical power delivery. Steel strands in ACSR cable play a supportive role for overhead power line. Inspection timely is an important means to insure safety operation of power lines. As steel strands are wrapped in the center of ACSR cable, the common artificial inspection methods with optical instruments are limited to find inner flaws of power line. Recently, inspection of power line by robot with detectors is a method with good prospect. In this paper, the optimal design model of detector based on magnetic leakage flux (MLF) carried by robot for detecting broken steel strands in ACSR cables has been proposed. The optimal design model of MFL sensor is solved by niche genetic algorithm (NGA). Field experiment results show that the design method of the detector can be applied to different types of ACSR cables. The magnitude field induced by transmission current has nearly no influences on the detection of broken steel strands, and the developed detector carried by robot can identify broken steel strands with high reliability and sensitivity. 1...|$|E

The aims of our research are to find the dependence of the cable resistance on the design parameters.

40|$|This work {{proposes a}} new cable tension {{identification}} technique {{based on a}} static inverse method that, by coupling a universal cable model with displacement and strain sensors data, exploits {{the differences between the}} original cable equilibrium problem and that of the cable loaded by a suitable added mass. The formulated inverse problem thus defines a data misfit functional based on the differences in terms of transverse displacements and elongations between the two equilibrium configurations. The inverse problem is implemented in a two-step identification procedure. First, the axial stiffness and mass per unit length are kept constant and the length of the cable is approximately found via a simple line search algorithm using finite differences to estimate the functional derivatives. Second, the other physical parameters are assessed using an adjoint method for which the direct problem, the adjoint problem and the parameters sensitivities are found as derivatives of a Lagrangian functional with respect to dual variables, primary variables, and parameters, respectively. Due to the ill-conditioning nature of the problem, the proposed method does not allow an exact parameter identification but it does lead to an acceptable tension assessment.

40|$|Undoped {{and carbon}} doped {{magnesium}} diboride (MgB 2) cables have been assembled by braiding six Nb/Monel and Nb/Cu/stainless steel (SS) sheathed mono- and multifilament strands {{with a central}} copper stabilizer for improving the operational environment. This paper presents the fabrication and characterization of two types of in situ powder-in-tube processed mono (pure) and multifilament (carbon doped) MgB 2 cables with different twist pitch lengths; thereby making them possible candidates for industrial AC applications. Critical current is not influenced by the cabling that results in various twist lengths. The total critical current of the braided cables is obtained by multiplying the critical current of six single wires without any dissipation. The critical current density (Jc) of pure (mono) and carbon doped (18 -filament) six <b>stranded</b> <b>cable</b> reached 10000 A/cm 2 at 5. 5 and 10 T, respectively; without any observable deleterious effect caused by varying the twist pitch.
