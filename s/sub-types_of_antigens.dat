40|$|This paper {{posits that}} our current {{understanding}} of Jihadist Terrorism as a monolithic <b>sub-type</b> <b>of</b> Political Terrorism is flawed {{and that as}} a result our governments counter this threat with inappropriately-adapted methods. The author argues: (A) There is a <b>sub-type</b> <b>of</b> Jihadist Terrorism that is more consistent with Walter’s ‘Military Terrorism’ or Feldman and Hinojosa’s ‘Guerrilla Warfare’ than within the typology of Political Terrorism; (B) The author-proposed <b>sub-type</b> <b>of</b> ‘War Terrorism’ should be accepted, examined, defined, and established; and (C) Establishing the author’s sub-type will allow western democracies to devise better counter-terrorism strategies while protecting the civil liberties of their citizens.

Twelve native speakers of Japan-ese read aloud twelve sentences that contained various <b>sub-types</b> <b>of</b> wa and ga. Acoustical analysis of fundamental frequency and pause durations revealed that wa was preceded by a larger fall in fundamental frequency than ga and that wa was frequently followed by a pause, unlike ga. Thematic and contrastive <b>sub-types</b> <b>of</b> wa were differentiated by pauses as well as fundamental frequency fall. Three <b>sub-types</b> <b>of</b> ga were not clearly differentiated by pauses, although differences were observed in the patterns of fundamental frequency...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} examines consumer {{attitudes towards}} four <b>SUb-types</b> <b>of</b> interactive digital advertising: internet-based e-and email advertising, and mobile-phone-based SMS- and MMS-type advertising. The differences in attitudes among these four <b>sub-types</b> <b>of</b> interactive digital advertising are also compared. Data are collected from three universities in Taiwan. Data analysis extracts three attitudinal forms (common factors) towards interactive digital advertising, namely, 'informative', 'entertaining' and 'irritating'. Consumer attitudinal forms towards e-advertising and MMS-type m-advertising are both similar and positive (i. e. informative and less irritating and entertaining). Their attitudinal forms towards email advertising and SMS-type in-advertising are less positive (more irritating and less informative and entertaining). Furthermore, the three attitudinal forms towards the four <b>SUb-types</b> <b>of</b> interactive digital advertising are compared. Consumer 'informative' and 'entertaining' attitudinal forms towards e-advertising and MMS-type m-advertising are similar, while their attitudinal forms towards email advertising and SMS-type m-advertising are equal and lower than towards {{the previous two}} <b>sub-types</b> <b>of</b> interactive digital advertising. As for the 'irritating' attitudinal form, consumers feel more 'irritated' towards email advertising and SMS-type m-advertising, while their attitudinal forms towards e-advertising and MMS-type m-advertising are equal and less irritated...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aims to analyze {{comparatively}} English and Persian research articles (Linguistics, Literature, and Library and Information disciplines) {{in terms of}} number and degree <b>of</b> utilization <b>of</b> <b>sub-types</b> <b>of</b> lexical cohesion in order to appreciate textualization processes in the two languages concerned. The study analyzes 60 research articles (30 articles in each language) in terms <b>of</b> <b>sub-types</b> <b>of</b> lexical cohesion. The study reveals that the order of occurrence in descending order <b>of</b> <b>sub-types</b> <b>of</b> lexical cohesion is (Rep., Col., Syn., Gen. N., Mer., Hyp., and Ant.) in English data, while the order in Persian data is (Rep., Syn., Col., Ant., Hyp., Mer., Gen. N.). In both data the most frequent sub-types are repetition, collocation, synonymy. In English data the general tendency is towards the use of repetition and collocation but Persian data show the general tendency towards the use of repetition and synonymy. This study might have implications for teachers and researchers {{in the field of}} teaching English as a foreign language {{because of the fact that}} teaching <b>sub-types</b> <b>of</b> lexical cohesion to foreign language learners will improve the quality of their reading and writing. </p...|$|R
