PCDD/F levels, expressed in 2, 3, 7, 8 TCDD toxic equivalents (TEQ), as analysed by TNO were 0. 20 ng TEQ/m 3 ind (before) and 0. 05 ng TEQ/m 3 ind (after), respectively. Using both negative chemical ionization (NCI) and electron impact (EI) -mass spectrometry, several brominated compounds were found and tentatively identified as bromobiphenyls (BrBs) and bromochloropolyaromatic hydrocarbons (Br/Cl-PAHs). In addition, some 28 monobromo-polychlorinated (Br/Cln, n= 3 - 7) DD/Fs could be demonstrated in low concentrations in both samples. Determination of their isomeric structure failed due to low sample sizes. Estimation of their TEQ value was performed {{on the basis of the}} response ratio for monobroom-heptachloor DD/Fs (Br-Cl 7 -DD/F) and quantified polychloro analogues (Cl 8 D/F). Assuming a random distribution of the Bratom, and an estimated relative occurrence of Br to Cl of 1 : 1000 per substituent, the additional BrCln-DD/F TEQ value was estimated to be not greater than approximately 1 % of the corresponding PSDD/F-TEQ value...|$|R

40|$|Development {{efforts have}} been {{underway}} for decades to replace dry-gas cleaning technology with humid-gas cleaning technology that would maintain the water vapor content in the raw <b>gas</b> by conducting <b>cleaning</b> at sufficiently high temperature to avoid water vapor condensation and would thus significantly simplify the plant and improve its thermal efficiency. Siemens Power Generation, Inc. conducted a program with the Gas Technology Institute (GTI) to develop a Novel Gas Cleaning process that uses {{a new type of}} gas-sorbent contactor, the ''filter-reactor''. The Filter-Reactor Novel Gas Cleaning process described and evaluated here is in its early stages of development and this evaluation is classified as conceptual. The commercial evaluations have been coupled with integrated Process Development Unit testing performed at a GTI coal gasifier test facility to demonstrate, at sub-scale the process performance capabilities. The commercial evaluations and Process Development Unit test results are presented in Volumes 1 and 2 of this report, respectively. Two <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> applications with significantly differing <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> requirements were considered in the evaluation: IGCC power generation, and Methanol Synthesis with electric power co-production. For the IGCC power generation application, two sets of <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> requirements were applied, one representing the most stringent ''current'' <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> requirements, and a second set representing possible, very stringent ''future'' <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> requirements. Current <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> requirements were used for Methanol Synthesis in the evaluation because these cleaning requirements represent the most stringent of cleaning requirements and the most challenging for the Filter-Reactor Novel Gas Cleaning process. The scope of the evaluation for each application was: (1) Select the configuration for the Filter-Reactor Novel Gas Cleaning Process, the arrangement of the individual <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> stages, and the probable operating conditions of the <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> stages to conceptually satisfy the <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> requirements; (2) Estimate process material & energy balances for the major plant sections and for each <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> stage; (3) Conceptually size and specify the major <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> process equipment; (4) Determine the resulting overall performance of the application; and (5) Estimate the investment cost and operating cost for each application. Analogous evaluation steps were applied for each application using conventional <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> technology, and comparison was made to extract the potential benefits, issues, and development needs of the Filter-Reactor Novel Gas <b>Cleaning</b> technology. The <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> process and related gas conditioning steps were also required to meet specifications that address plant environmental emissions, the protection of the gas turbine and other Power Island components, and the protection of the methanol synthesis reactor. Detailed material & energy balances for the <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> applications, coupled with preliminary thermodynamic modeling and laboratory testing of candidate sorbents, identified the probable sorbent types that should be used, their needed operating conditions in each stage, and their required levels of performance. The study showed that Filter-Reactor Novel Gas Cleaning technology can be configured to address and conceptually meet all of the <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> requirements for IGCC, and that it can potentially overcome several of the conventional IGCC power plant availability issues, resulting in improved power plant thermal efficiency and cost. For IGCC application, Filter-Reactor Novel Gas Cleaning yields 6 % greater generating capacity and 2. 3 percentage-points greater efficiency under the Current Standards case, and more than 9 % generating capacity increase and 3. 6 percentage-points higher efficiency in the Future Standards case. While the conceptual equipment costs are estimated to be only slightly lower for the Filter-Reactor Novel Gas Cleaning processes than for the conventional processes, the improved power plant capacity results in the potential for significant reductions in the plant cost-of-electricity, about 4. 5 % for the Current Standards case, and more than 7 % for the Future Standards case. For Methanol Synthesis, the Novel Gas Cleaning process scheme again shows the potential for significant advantages over the conventional <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> schemes. The plant generating capacity is increased more than 7 % and there is a 2. 3 %-point gain in plant thermal efficiency. The Total Capital Requirement is reduced by about 13 % and the cost-of-electricity is reduced by almost 9 %. For both IGCC Methanol Synthesis cases, there are opportunities to combine some of the filter-reactor polishing stages to simplify the process further to reduce its cost. This evaluation has devised plausible humid-gas cleaning schemes for the Filter-Reactor Novel Gas Cleaning process that might be applied in IGCC and Methanol Synthesis applications...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is a {{comparison}} of different kinds of flue <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> systems of municipal solid waste incinerators (MSWI). This comparison will be done with the aid of material flow analysis. In addition, investment costs will be taken into consideration. The main topic of the investigation is the relationship between type of flue <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> system and resulting material flow including auxiliary chemicals and solid residues. Material flow analyses are performed by model calculations. Data used for these calculations are representative of operating values for technical-scale plants. As starting point a model plant with grate firing is considered. For this plant 10 different flue <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> systems are analysed, 6 of them being equipped with a wet cleaning system. Additionally, 2 systems operating in a semi dry sorption and 2 systems operating in conditioned dry sorption are taken into account. The system boundaries for the material flow analysis performed include the entire flue <b>gas</b> <b>cleaning</b> system, starting with the raw gas downstream of the boiler and ending downstream of the stack.
