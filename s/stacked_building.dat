40|$|A {{comparative}} study on oligo(p-phenylene vinylene) (OPV) -appended porphyrins containing all trans-vinylene (either hydrophilic or lipophilic) or amide linkages (lipophilic) is presented. The type of supramolecular arrangement obtained in organic solvents {{proves to be}} strongly dependent {{on the nature of}} the covalent connection. In the case of all trans-vinylene linkages, a J-type intermolecular packing is obtained and the assemblies are only of moderate stability. Conversely, the supramolecular structures obtained from the amide-linked system display an H-type stacking arrangement of enhanced stability and chirality as a consequence of intermolecular hydrogen bonding along the stack direction, favorably interlocking the <b>stacked</b> <b>building</b> blocks. Interestingly, the observed differences in stability and organization are qualitatively illustrated by monitoring the sequential energy transfer process in both types of assemblies. Efficient intramolecular energy transfer from the OPVs (donors) to the respective porphyrin cores is followed by energy transfer from Zn-porphyrin (donor) to free-base porphyrin (acceptor) in both systems. However, the improved intermolecular organization for the amide-linked system increases the energy transfer efficiency along the stack direction. In addition, the water-soluble (OPV) -appended porphyrin system forms highly stable assemblies in an aqueous environment. Nevertheless, the poor energy transfer efficiency along the stack direction reveals a relative lack of organization in these assemblies. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This thesis was {{initiated}} by a project planing the world's tallest timber building in Bergen, Norway, (the VHT project). The {{concept of the}} building {{is based on a}} load baring glulam frame with building modules stacked inside to create the residential area of the building. Calculation done by Sweco showed that more damping was needed to lower the accelerations in {{the top floor of the}} building. Since little was known about the dynamic properties of building modules and whether these could be used to increase the damping of the building, a survey was wanted. In this master thesis the dynamic properties of the building modules have been evaluated. This has been done by preforming dynamic test on building modules similar to those planed for the VHT project. Two test protocols were used to test the modules, an experimental modal analysis method using a modal hammer and a system identification method. The goal of the tests was to identify the modal frequencies, damping ratios and mode shapes of the building modules. The tested modules were modeled in a finite element (FE) method program and scaled to fit the size of the VHT modules. This way the dynamic properties of the VHT modules could be estimated. Simple shear frame models of the VHT modules were made to be implemented in a larger model of the VHT building to evaluate the effect of the modules on the entire structure. Several detailed FE models were made to evaluate how the separate parts of the modules influenced the dynamic response of the modules. An evaluation of the dynamic properties of the sound reducing material Stepisol was also done by dynamic testing in the lab and FE modeling. It was found that the tested modules had two translational modes and one torsional mode. The overall damping ratio of the modules was found to be roughly 3 %. From the numerical tests the stiffness of the module walls were found to be more or less constant per meter wall. The walls can therefor easily be scaled for similar modules with different dimensions to predict the dynamic properties of the new modules. The Stepisol was found to influence the dynamic properties of the <b>stacked</b> <b>building</b> modules severely. The lab tests showed that Stepisol has a high material damping that helps increasing the damping in the modules. The FE models showed that layers of Stepisol makes the stacked modules a lot less stiff and it is a key feature that can be used to alter the dynamic behavior of stacked modules.

40|$|A {{radiological}} {{assessment was}} carried out on the release of positron-emitting radioactive gases from a roof-level stack at a central London site. Different modelling approaches were performed to investigate the range of radiation doses to representative persons. Contributions from plume inhalation, gamma shine and immersion to effective dose were taken into account. Dry and wet surface deposition on the roof, and exposure from contamination on the skin of roof-workers, added only a mean 4. 7 % to effective dose and were neglected. A 1 : 200 scale model, consisting of the <b>stack</b> and surrounding <b>buildings,</b> was tested in a wind tunnel to simulate pollutant dispersion in the near-field region i. e. rooftop. Concentration field measurements in the wind tunnel were converted into effective dose, including for roof-workers installing glass cladding to the <b>stack</b> <b>building.</b> Changes in the building shape, from addition of the cladding layer, were investigated {{in terms of the}} near-field flow pattern and significant differences found between the two cases. Pollutant concentrations were also modelled using Air Dispersion Modelling System (ADMS) and the results used to calculate the effective dose using the same meteorological data set and source release terms. Sector averaged wind tunnel dose estimates were greater than the ADMS figure by approximately a factor of two to three.
