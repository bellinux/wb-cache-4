The equipment developed met the requirements from Yankuang Group for a coal production of 10, 000 – 13, 000 t/d. During {{the period of}} the tenth five-year national economic plan, Yankuang Group, the Taiyuan Branch of China Coal Research Institute and Northwestern Benniu Group jointly developed the SGZ 1000 / 1200 and the SGZ 1200 / 1400 long distance high reliability front <b>scraper</b> <b>conveyor</b> and rear <b>scraper</b> <b>conveyor.</b> Currently, the SFZ 1200 / 1400 long distance high reliable rear <b>scraper</b> <b>conveyor</b> is an ultra-heavy <b>scraper</b> <b>conveyor</b> for LTCC faces, which is characterized by its highest power level, widest chute and longest length. Furthermore, it integrated various advanced technologies, including automatic extension of the conveyor end, hydraulic motor chain tensioner, speed adjustment hydraulic coupler and compact chain.

40|$|The basic {{behavior}} of mining crushed goods in chain <b>scraper</b> <b>conveyors</b> was examined using a special test stand.

Crushed goods with a narrow granular profile and sphere-like grains caused about 35 % greater resistance than fine coal and raw coal with broad granular profile. For goods containing water more than 10 % by weight, the solids friction retreated in favor of flow friction. The coefficient of resistance decreased considerably in the range of lower speeds and then increased with increasing conveyor speed. The conveyance of sandstone ore required about 280 % greater specific drive than the conveyance of raw coal. Resistance coefficients for coal and raw coal showed no dependence on the design of the conveyor.

Field studies has been conducted at a couple of Vendig AB´s costumers to get a knowledge base about how Vendig AB´s products are used, how they function and the environment they operate in.

40|$|Pig {{houses are}} {{important}} sources of ammonia (NH 3) emissions. For decades, investigations {{were carried out}} in determine the influencing factors and to point out opportunities of mitigation. In Europe, current NH 3 emissions associated to pig production are about 24 % lower than in 1990. However, further reduction seems necessary to avoid noxious effects on ecosystems. The main factors influencing NH 3 production are the floor type, the manure removal system, the climatic conditions inside the building, the diet composition and the feed efficiency of animals. In pig production, the main floor types are the slatted floor and the bedded floor systems. In both systems, numerous variants and adaptations can be found with consequently a range of emission levels for each housing condition. Therefore, decision in favour of a floor type as regards NH 3 emissions is difficult, especially as effective reducing strategies are available for both systems. For litter-based systems, the nature {{and the amount of}} substrate greatly influence the NH 3 production with usually lower emission in case of generous bedding. For slatted floor systems, most of the studies resulted in lower emissions with partly slatted floor on condition that the solid part of the floor remains clean. Indeed, hot conditions, high animal density or inadequate pen design can increase the soiling of the solid floor and lead to increased NH 3 emissions. In any case, emissions are lower if concrete slats are replaced by smooth materials like iron cast, metal or plastic slats. Several slurry pit designs and manure removal strategies were developed to mitigate emissions. The reduction of the slurry pit surface thanks to sloped pit walls are related to proportional reductions of NH 3 emissions. Frequent manure removal, flushing and separating urine from faeces by V-shaped <b>scraper</b> or <b>conveyor</b> belts reduce the NH 3 releases from the buildings by about 50 %. However, the emissions during the storage period outside the building have {{to be taken into account}} for a whole assessment of the technique. Climate conditions inside the building also influence the emissions which are positively correlated with ambient temperature and ventilation rate. Consequently, ammonia emissions present seasonal and nychtemeral patterns. But, reducing the NH 3 production by modulation of the climate conditions is rather unpractical because the ambient parameters must primarily respect the bioclimatic requirements for animal comfort. A closer match between dietary intakes and requirement of the pigs according to the physiological and growth stage results in lower NH 3 emissions. In this way, diets with reduced crude protein content are highly effective in reducing the emissions with almost a 10 % reduction for every 10 g kg− 1 reduction in dietary crude protein. Other dietary strategies are also effective in lowering emissions. Dietary fibre inclusion reduces NH 3 emissions by about 40 % by shifting the nitrogen from urine to faeces due to promotion of bacterial growth in the large intestine. Lowering the dietary electrolyte balance or supplementation with acidifying salts like benzoic acid or CaSO 4 are related to significant reductions. Other feed additives like Yucca extract, zeolites, probiotics, humic substance or lactose were also validated by several experiments. Moreover, better feed efficiency obtained by genetic selection or modification of the hormonal status of the pigs is also related to reduced emissions. In conclusion, effective reduction of ammonia emissions from pig buildings can be reached operating both on housing conditions and feeding strategies. The former are very efficient but the assessment has to include the specificity of each system and involve the complete process. In some cases, investment and cost operating can hamper their development. Feeding strategies offer the advantage of being easy to implement and rapid to adapt function of particular circumstances.
