5|$|Some older <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> that statin therapy might reduce vasospasm, but a {{subsequent}} meta-analysis including further trials did not demonstrate benefit on either vasospasm or outcomes. While corticosteroids with mineralocorticoid activity {{may help prevent}} vasospasm their use {{does not appear to}} change outcomes.|$|E
5|$|Occupational {{chemical}} {{exposure to}} benzene and other aromatic organic solvents is controversial {{as a cause}} of AML. Benzene and many of its derivatives are known to be carcinogenic in vitro. While some <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> a link between occupational exposure to benzene and increased risk of AML, others have suggested the attributable risk, if any, is slight.|$|E

5|$|Some <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that the}} clade Megaraptora, usually {{considered}} to be allosauroids, are basal tyrannosauroids. However, other authors disputed the placement of megaraptorans within Tyrannosauroidea, and a study of megaraptoran hand anatomy published in 2016 caused even the original scientists suggesting their tyrannosauroid relationships to at least partly reject their prior conclusion.|$|E
5|$|<b>Studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> {{a strong}} {{association}} exists between an increased {{body mass index}} {{and the development of}} plantar fasciitis in the non-athletic population; this association between weight and plantar fasciitis has not been observed in the athletic population. Achilles tendon tightness and inappropriate footwear have also been identified as significant risk factors.|$|E
5|$|<b>Studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> that {{infants with}} a high-risk for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) may express {{attachment}} security differently from infants with a low-risk for ASD.

5|$|Although most {{patients}} present without any known risk factors evident, {{a number of}} risk factors {{for the development of}} cholangiocarcinoma have been described. In the Western world, the most common of these is primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), an inflammatory disease of the bile ducts which is closely associated with ulcerative colitis (UC). Epidemiologic <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> that the lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma for a person with PSC is on the order of 10%–15%, although autopsy series have found rates as high as 30% in this population. The mechanism by which PSC increases the risk of cholangiocarcinoma is not well understood.|$|E
5|$|Translation {{problems}} are {{compounded by the}} women's confusion over which type of FGM they experienced, or even whether they experienced it. Several <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> that survey responses are unreliable. A 2003 study in Ghana found that in 1995 four percent said they had not undergone FGM, but in 2000 said they had, while 11 percent switched in the other direction. In Tanzania in 2005, 66 percent reported FGM, but a medical exam found that 73 percent had undergone it. In Sudan in 2006, {{a significant percentage of}} infibulated women and girls reported a less severe type.|$|E
5|$|While the N-terminal nucleotide-binding {{pocket of}} Hsp90 is most widely studied and thus targeted, recent <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that a second}} ATP-binding site {{is located in the}} Hsp90 C-terminus.

Although none of the C-terminal Hsp90 inhibitors have yet to enter the clinic, the use of both N- and C-terminal Hsp90 inhibitors in combination represents an exciting new strategy for chemotherapy.|$|E

5|$|Adult {{butterflies}} consume only liquids, ingested {{through the}} proboscis. They sip water from damp patches for hydration and feed on nectar from flowers, {{from which they}} obtain sugars for energy, and sodium and other minerals vital for reproduction. Several species of butterflies need more sodium than that provided by nectar and are attracted by sodium in salt; they sometimes land on people, attracted by the salt in human sweat. Some butterflies also visit dung, rotting fruit or carcasses to obtain minerals and nutrients. In many species, this mud-puddling behaviour is restricted to the males, and <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> that the nutrients collected may be provided as a nuptial gift, along with the spermatophore, during mating.|$|E
5|$|Even {{people with}} {{complete}} SCI, in whom {{the spinal cord}} cannot transmit any messages past {{the level of the}} lesion, can achieve orgasm. In 1960, in one of the earliest studies to look at orgasm and SCI, the term phantom orgasm was coined to describe women's perception of orgasmic sensations despite SCI—but subsequent <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> the experience is not merely psychological. Men with complete SCI report sexual sensations at the time of ejaculation, accompanied by physical signs normally found at orgasm, such as increased blood pressure. Women can experience orgasm with vibration to the cervix regardless of level or completeness of injury; the sensation is the same as uninjured women experience.|$|E
5|$|Japan has full {{religious}} freedom based on Article 20 of its Constitution. Upper estimates suggest that 84–96 {{percent of the}} Japanese population subscribe to Shinto as its indigenous religion (50% to 80% of which considering degrees of syncretism with Buddhism, shinbutsu-shūgō. However, these estimates are based on people affiliated with a temple, rather {{than the number of}} true believers. The number of Shinto shrines in Japan is estimated to be around 100,000. Other <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> that only 30 percent of the population identify themselves as belonging to a religion. According to Edwin Reischauer and Marius Jansen, some 70–80% of the Japanese do not consider themselves believers in any religion. Nevertheless, the level of participation remains high, especially during festivals and occasions such as the first shrine visit of the New Year. Taoism and Confucianism from China have also influenced Japanese beliefs and customs. Japanese streets are decorated on Tanabata, Obon and Christmas.|$|E

5|$|Ostrom {{suggested}} that Deinonychus could kick with the sickle claw {{to cut and}} slash at its prey. Some researchers even {{suggested that}} the talon was used to disembowel large ceratopsian dinosaurs. Other <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> that the sickle claws {{were not used to}} slash but rather to deliver small stabs to the victim. In 2005, Manning and colleagues ran tests on a robotic replica that precisely matched the anatomy of Deinonychus and Velociraptor, and used hydraulic rams to make the robot strike a pig carcass. In these tests, the talons made only shallow punctures and could not cut or slash. The authors suggested that the talons would have been more effective in climbing than in dealing killing blows.|$|E
5|$|The Indian and Javan rhinoceros, {{the only}} {{members of the}} genus Rhinoceros, first appear in the fossil record in Asia around 1.6 million–3.3 million years ago. Molecular estimates, however, suggest the two species diverged from each other much earlier, around 11.7 million years ago. Although {{belonging}} to the type genus, the Indian and Javan rhinoceroses are not believed to be closely related to other rhino species. Different studies have hypothesized {{that they may be}} closely related to the extinct Gaindatherium or Punjabitherium. A detailed cladistic analysis of the Rhinocerotidae placed Rhinoceros and the extinct Punjabitherium in a clade with Dicerorhinus, the Sumatran rhino. Other <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> the Sumatran rhinoceros is more closely related to the two African species. The Sumatran rhino may have diverged from the other Asian rhinos 15 million years ago, or as far back as 25.9 million years ago based on mitochondrial data.|$|E
5|$|The major {{effect of}} the apolipoprotein A5 gene (and its variants) is on plasma {{triglyceride}} levels. Minor alleles (C1131 and Trp19) are primarily associated with the elevation of plasma triglyceride levels. The most extensive information available has been drawn from Caucasian populations, particularly {{in relation to the}} rs662799 SNP. Here, one minor allele is associated with an approximate 0,25mmol/L increase of plasma TG levels. A similar effect is associated with the Trp19 allele, even though it has not been confirmed by a huge number of studies. Original studies have further described that the strongest effect of APOA5 polymorphisms on plasma TG levels is observed among Hispanics, with only minor effects detected among Africans. Among Asians, the effect on plasma TG levels is similar that found among Caucasians. Generally, <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> significant interethnic differences and in some cases sex-dependent associations as well.|$|E
50|$|Another DNA-based <b>study</b> <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that the}} {{branching}} order was Panthera tigris first, followed by P. onca, P. leo, {{and the last}} two sister species: P. pardus and P. uncia.|$|R

5|$|Various <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that several}} {{individuals}} would gather {{eggs in a}} single nest, and arrange them {{so they could be}} protected by one individual, possibly a male. In 2010 David J. Varricchio and colleagues found that the relatively large clutch-size of oviraptorids and troodontids is most similar to those of modern archosaurs (birds and crocodilians, the closest living relatives of dinosaurs) that practice polygamous mating and extensive male parental care (as seen in paleognaths such as ostriches and emus). This reproductive system pre-dates the origin of birds and would therefore be the ancestral condition for modern birds, with biparental care (where both parents participate) being a later development. Many oviraptorosaurs are known to have had pygostyles on the end of their tails, which suggests the presence of feather-fans; these could have been used for intraspecific communication such as courtship rituals.|$|E
5|$|Aetosaurs were herbivores, likely {{feeding on}} ferns and seed ferns that were {{common in the}} Triassic. The upturned shape of their snout {{suggests}} that aetosaurs may have dug up roots and tubers. Aetosaurs have several anatomical features {{that may have been}} adaptations to digging, including a short radius relative to the humerus (seen in many other digging tetrapods) and a large deltopectoral crest on the humerus that served as an attachment for muscles. Aetosaurs also have large hind feet, or pes, with large claws that were likely used for skratch-digging. One aetosaur, Typothorax, has an entepicondyle on the humerus, which is the origin of forearm pronator and manual flexor muscles often used in digging. Moreover, it has a large olecranon process on the ulna which projects backward past the elbow, giving a large area for the insertion of the triceps muscle. While many <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> that aetosaurs had a fossorial or burrowing lifestyle, aetosaurs have few of the characteristics that fossorial animals have as adaptations to digging. Therefore, it is likely that aetosaurs were able to dig to some extent, possibly rooting for food, but were unable to burrow.|$|E
5|$|Early writers {{combined}} ctenophores with cnidarians into {{a single}} phylum called Coelenterata on account of morphological similarities between the two groups. Like cnidarians, the bodies of ctenophores consist of a mass of jelly, with one layer of cells {{on the outside and}} another lining the internal cavity. In ctenophores, however, these layers are two cells deep, while those in cnidarians are only a single cell deep. Ctenophores also resemble cnidarians in relying on water flow through the body cavity for both digestion and respiration, as well as in having a decentralized nerve net rather than a brain. However, genomic <b>studies</b> <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> that the neurons of Ctenophora, which differ in many ways from other animal neurons, evolved independently from those of the other animals, and increasing awareness {{of the differences between the}} groups has persuaded more recent authors to classify the two as separate phyla. The position of the ctenophores in the evolutionary family tree of animals has long been debated, and the majority view at present, based on molecular phylogenetics, is that cnidarians and bilaterians are more closely related to each other than either is to ctenophores.|$|E
