5|$|Principe di Carignano saw action {{during the}} Battle of Lissa in 1866 during the Third Italian War of Independence. There, <b>she</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> Italian line, the {{flagship}} of Admiral Giovanni Vacca; the leading squadron of the Italian fleet became {{separated from the}} rest of the fleet and was not heavily engaged. Her career was limited after the war, owing to the emergence of more modern ironclads and a severe reduction in the Italian naval budget following their defeat at Lissa. The ship was stricken from the naval register in 1875 and broken up for scrap to free up funds needed for new ironclads under construction.|$|E
5|$|Principe di Carignano {{took part}} in the Battle of Lissa on 20 July 1866, where <b>she</b> <b>led</b> <b>the</b> Italian line of battle, but was not heavily engaged.

In an effort to reduce the maintenance budget to offset the cost of newer ships under construction, Principe di Carignano was stricken from the naval register in 1875; Messina and Conte Verde followed in 1880, the latter just nine years after completion.|$|E
