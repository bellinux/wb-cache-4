We had previously verified that, with almost no exceptions, termination or <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> had occurred for reasons other than work—most commonly mortality. Our reasoning for this modification is that mailing the Ticket to these beneficiaries during any month of the rollout would almost certainly have had no impact on their employment outcomes, in which case essentially all outcomes would have been the same as those observed had SSA mailed all of these Tickets in their IMM.|$|E
40|$|Many {{countries}} rely on {{monitoring of}} unemployment insurance and welfare recipients and impose benefit sanctions {{in case of}} noncompliance with job search requirements to encourage job search and to prevent abuse of the social insurance system. This paper systematically analyzes the characteristics of optimal monitoring and sanctioning systems for the unemployed {{as a function of}} worker characteristics, unemployment duration, the monitoring technology, worker preferences and the generosity of the welfare system. I propose a theoretical framework where benefits, wage taxes, the job search requirement, the monitoring intensity and the size of a benefit sanction are endogenously chosen by the planner for each period of unemployment. I allow for arbitrary ex-ante heterogeneity in reemployment wages and job finding probabilities as well as for dependence of these key parameters on unemployment duration. I find that the optimal sanction is in the majority of cases a temporary cut in benefits to zero, i. e. full <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits.</b> The optimal monitoring intensity increases as the returns to search deteriorate with falling reemployment wages and job finding rates during unemployment in order to restore search incentives. It also increases with the generosity of the welfare system because monitoring can be used to offset some of the disincentives to search implied by more generous benefit payments. I also demonstrate how very informative and large data can be used to considerably improve and extend the insights that can be obtained from numerically solving and simulating economic models. I propose and apply a new method that allows quantifying the impact of implementing the optimal policy on the job finding probabilities. I find that the optimal policy implies considerably higher job finding rates than the actual policy, especially for low-skilled workers...|$|E

40|$|The most {{commonly}} reported {{statistics on the}} work activities of Supplemental Security Income (SSI) beneficiaries are cross-sectional—that is, they reflect the activities of all beneficiaries in a particular month or year. Longitudinal statistics, in contrast, follow a group of beneficiaries {{over a longer period}} and show higher levels <b>of</b> employment and <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> due to work compared to the cross-sectional data. For example, cross-sectional statistics show that, in December 2007, just over 2 percent of working-age SSI beneficiaries with disabilities had their <b>benefits</b> suspended because <b>of</b> work under the 1619 (b) workincentive program (SSA 2008 a). But longitudinal statistics show that a larger share of those first awarded SSI benefits as adults in 2001 —more than 8 percent—had been in 1619 (b) status for at least a month by December 2007. 2 The longitudinal statistics for people under age 40 at award are especially remarkable; by December 2007, 19 percent of those ages 18 or 19 at award and 15 percent of those ages 20 to 39 at award had stopped receiving SSI <b>benefits</b> because <b>of</b> work for at least one month. The cross-sectional and longitudinal statistics are fully consistent with each other and differ only because they reflect the same phenomenon from different perspectives.

The case at bar was thus more like Kent than Zemel because the statute and regulation prohibited Ms. Eunique from traveling out of the United States based on her debtor status (a “characteristic peculiar” to her), rather than “foreign policy considerations affecting all citizens.” Nor did Aznavorian; the Court in Aznavorian explicitly distinguished passport restrictions from the “rational basis” review it gave the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> government <b>benefits</b> while abroad, noting that the law at issue “does not limit the availability or validity of passports”. Similarly, neither Haig nor Regan supported the ban. Haig upheld the application of a regulation narrowly tailored to “cases involving likelihood of ‘serious damage’ to national security or foreign policy" [...] and Regan upheld a narrowly tailored travel restriction that supported the government’s important foreign policy and national security interests. None of these recognized a “First Amendment exception” to rule of rational basis review for travel restrictions.|$|R
40|$|No current {{research}} {{exists on the}} impact of the attitudes of perfectionism on the unemployed, though earlier research exists from studies of the employed and of university students. The current study examined, for 34 unemployed individuals in the Personal Support Programme, the relationship between perfectionism and self-esteem, general well-being, and life satisfaction. The project is on-going. This project used the Multi-dimensional Perfectionism Scale, the General Health Questionnaire, a depression questionnaire and a general questionnaire on the satisfaction of the unemployed individuals and their willingness to seek employment. The findings emphasised that maladaptive perfectionism {{may play a role in}} the psychological distress of the unemployed, though further study to unravel the effects of unemployment itself from the impacts of developed attitudes of maladaptive perfectionism is needed. Identification of the possible role of pre-existing maladaptive perfectionism in the experience of psychological distress may have implications for mandatory employment programs (e. g., Work for the Dole) and for the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> the unemployment <b>benefits</b> when such activities are breached. Paradoxically, these breaches could, for maladaptive perfectionists, decrease the behavioural pursuit of employment and increase psychological distress rather than motivate job search activity...|$|R
40|$|Defining {{the scope}} of the Constitution’s {{application}} outside U. S. territory is more important than ever. This month the Supreme Court will hear oral argument about whether the Constitution applies when a U. S. officer shoots a Mexican child across the border. Meanwhile the federal courts are scrambling to evaluate the constitutionality of an Executive Order that, among other things, deprives immigrants of their right to reenter the United States. Yet the extraterritorial reach of the Due Process Clause—the broadest constitutional limit on the government’s authority to deprive persons of “life, liberty, and property”—remains obscure. Up to now, scholars have uniformly concluded that the founding generation did not understand due process to apply abroad, at least not to aliens. This Article challenges that consensus. Based on the English historical background, constitutional structure, and the early practice of federal law enforcement on the high seas, this Article argues that the founding generation understood due process to apply to any exercise of federal law enforcement, criminal or civil, against any person, anywhere in the world. Outside the context of war, no one believed that a federal officer could deprive a suspect of life, liberty, or property without due process of law—even if the capture occurred abroad or the suspect was a non-citizen. This history has important implications. It strongly supports the extension of due process to federal criminal and civil law enforcement, regardless the suspect’s location or citizenship. This principle has immediate implications for cross-border shootings, officially sponsored kidnappings and detentions abroad, the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> immigration <b>benefits,</b> and the acquisition of foreign evidence for criminal defendants...|$|R

However, I think that this method of judgment ignores the requirements of Article 27 - 2, simply imposing the `penalty' in the community, which has no desirable effect on the offender's rehabilitation. Furthermore, such method of judgment might assign a longer `penalty' to the offender whose sentence had been fully executed with short or no parole term, because of his/her criminal responsibility. In this paper, I reconsider the discussion on `partial <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' and `full <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> execution of the sentence' in order to clarify the image of those whose sentence is `partially suspended' under Article 27 - 2.
