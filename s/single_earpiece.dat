25|$|It {{could be}} argued that radio was born in Cornwall. In 1901 at Poldhu on The Lizard, Guglielmo Marconi made his first trans-atlantic radio transmission. It would be another twenty six years before the BBC National Programme was audible in Cornwall, from the then new long wave {{transmitter}} at Daventry, although BBC transmissions began in 1922. The transmission, coming a long way from Cornwall, (from the centre of the English Midlands), was crackly and barely audible at night-time, and it was a solitary listening experience, as sets were only equipped with a <b>single</b> <b>earpiece,</b> and not a loudspeaker.|$|E
5000|$|The {{stethoscope}} {{was invented}} in France in 1816 by Ren√© Laennec at the Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital in Paris. It consisted of a wooden tube and was monaural. Laennec invented the stethoscope because he was uncomfortable placing his ear on women's chests to hear heart sounds. He observed that a rolled notebook, placed between the patient's chest and his ear, could amplify heart sounds without requiring physical contact. Laennec's device {{was similar to the}} common ear trumpet, a historical form of hearing aid; indeed, his invention was almost indistinguishable in structure and function from the trumpet, which was commonly called a [...] "microphone". Laennec called his device the [...] "stethoscope" [...] ( [...] + , [...] "chest scope"), and he called its use [...] " [...] auscultation", because it was auscultation with a tool intermediate between the patient's body and the physician's ear. (Today the word auscultation denotes all such listening, mediate or not.) The first flexible stethoscope of any sort may have been a binaural instrument with articulated joints not very clearly described in 1829. In 1840, Golding Bird described a stethoscope he had been using with a flexible tube. Bird was the first to publish a description of such a stethoscope but he noted in his paper the prior existence of an earlier design (which he thought was of little utility) which he described as the snake ear trumpet. Bird's stethoscope had a <b>single</b> <b>earpiece.</b>|$|E
40|$|In I 894 Leonard Gigli {{described}} a simple device for cutting bones. The instru-ment {{consisted of a}} single steel wire, the surface {{of which had been}} roughened, and two handles which were attached {{to the ends of the}} wire allowing to-and-fro move-ments. Since that time, the apparatus has been modified, using braided wires with corrugations and has become known as the Gigli saw. Because of its simplicity and reliability, the Gigli saw has become very popular as a bone-cutting instrument. The main difficulty in its use is in passing the device around the bone which is to be cut. At least two instruments have been designed to help effect this passage 2, 3 We have modified a stethoscope earpiece in such a way as to make a very suit-able guide for passage of the Gigli saw (Fig. 1). A transverse bar is welded onto the end of the <b>single</b> <b>earpiece</b> of the stethoscope to allow control of the apparatus. A semisharp trocar is machined to screw on the tip of the earpiece to allow passage through soft tissue. After passage is accomplished, the trocar is removed. The Gigli saw is then inserted through the guide, and the guide is removed. This permits divi-sion of the bone from within outwards under full control.

50|$|There are {{two types}} of Bluetooth headsets. Headsets using Bluetooth v1.0 or v1.1 {{generally}} consist of a <b>single</b> monaural <b>earpiece,</b> which can only access Bluetooth's headset/handsfree profile. Depending on the phone's operating system, this type of headset will either play music at a very low quality (suitable for voice), or will be unable to play music at all. Headsets with the A2DP profile can play stereo music with acceptable quality. Some A2DP-equipped headsets automatically de-activate the microphone function while playing music; if these headsets are paired to a computer via Bluetooth connection, the headset may disable either the stereo or the microphone function.|$|R
