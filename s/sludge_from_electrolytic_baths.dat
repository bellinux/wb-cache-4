40|$|The {{preparation}} of PbO 2 coatings on reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) {{has been carried}} out at constant current <b>from</b> <b>electrolytic</b> <b>baths</b> containing aqueous Pb(II) and methanesulfonic acid (MSA, CH 3 SO 3 H). The morphological and structural analysis of the RVC/PbO 2 deposits carried out by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction revealed that a thick (100 ?m), homogeneous, nanostructured ?-PbO 2 film can be successfully formed. As a result, three-dimensional ?-PbO 2 structures were obtained, being particularly interesting for their use as anodes in wastewater treatment. The high oxidation ability of these anodes has been verified by the electro-oxidation of Methyl Orange aqueous solutions. Quick decolourisation was achieved, with total colour removal in less than 60 min at 600 mA due to the production of large amounts of reactive OH radicals from the oxidation of water at high anodic potentials. The progressive mineralisation of the solutions was also ascertained from the total organic carbon (TOC) removal, which was much quicker at a higher applied current. All the coated RVC electrodes exhibited excellent long-term stability and remained unaltered after prolonged electrolyses. In addition, novel PbO 2 composite coatings were prepared in the presence of hydrothermally synthesized titanate nanotubes (TiNT). The SEM images showed the presence of TiNT agglomerates along the PbO 2 surface, which led to higher anodic current in the cyclic voltammetries carried out with Methyl Orange solutions. It is suggested that TiNT favour the adsorption of the organic molecules, facilitating the contact with the OH radicals and thus accelerating the electro-oxidation process. This was confirmed by the faster TOC removal compared to that yielded by the RVC/PbO 2, being 45 % instead of 24 % at 120 mi...|$|R

Structural analysis indicated the formation of CdTe layers without other possible phases at a concentration of similar to 0. 05 M of iodine in the bath. Optical absorption measurements have yielded a direct band gap value of 1. 42 +/- 0. 03 eV without showing any noticeable changes of the energy gap. Inclusion of iodine in CdTe layers have increased the electrical conductivity {{by a factor of}} 5, indicating positive n-type doping effects. The diodes of FTO/CdS/CdTe/Au structures showed improved current-voltage characteristics indicating the presence of a high potential barrier of 1. 20 eV with low ideality factors around 1. 40.

40|$|Cadmium sulfide (CdS) is a {{well-known}} window material used for fabrication of second generation thin film solar cells including CdS/CdTe and CdS/CuInGaSe 2. Among the CdS fabrication techniques, electrodeposition is a simple, cost effective and scalable method that has been stepped towards large scale commercialization. However, the presence of precipitates in baths used for electrodeposition of CdS {{has been found to}} be a persistent problem which had produced CdS thin films with poor photovoltaic properties. Hence, an investigation was carried out to identify a set of optimum physiochemical conditions that can produce clear stable electrolyte for electrodeposition of CdS thin film semiconductors using CdCl 2 and Na 2 S 2 O 3 precursor salts.

Decreasing thiourea content 0. 06 M and increasing gluconate concentration up to 0. 3 M, better deposits (more compact with lower sulphur content (1. 2 wt. %)) were obtained. A clear influence of the species present in the bath on the film quality was observed: while gluconate favoured film cohesion, boric acid hindered hydrogen adsorption. For all films, fcc-Ag, hcp-Co and hcp-CoAg 3 phases were always detected by XRD, TEM and electron diffraction, their proportions varying with the electrodeposition conditions. Magnetic measurements revealed {{that the increase in}} the CoAg 3 led to an increase in the film coercivity.
