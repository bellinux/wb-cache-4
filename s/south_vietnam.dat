Running from the southwestern corner of North Vietnam through southeastern Laos and into the western portions of <b>South</b> <b>Vietnam,</b> the trail system had been the target of continuous U.S. aerial interdiction efforts that had begun in 1966. Only small-scale covert operations in support of the air campaigns had, however, been conducted on the ground inside Laos to halt the flow of men and supplies on the trail.|$|E

Australia later sent troops to support <b>South</b> <b>Vietnam</b> in the anti-communist fight, but the bipartisanship evaporated during the mid-1960s as the ALP began to sympathise with North Vietnam and opposition to the Vietnam War grew. The ALP later withdrew support for and refused to accept refugees from <b>South</b> <b>Vietnam</b> after winning office, but on the return of the centre right Liberal-National coalition to power in 1975, Vietnamese refugees were allowed to resettle in Australia in large numbers.|$|E
5|$|During the First Indochina War, Lê Duẩn was {{an active}} revolutionary leader in <b>South</b> <b>Vietnam.</b> He headed the Central Office of <b>South</b> <b>Vietnam,</b> a party organ, from 1951 until 1954. During the 1950s Lê Duẩn became {{increasingly}} aggressive towards <b>South</b> <b>Vietnam</b> and called for reunification through war. By the mid-to-late 1950s Lê Duẩn had become the second-most powerful policy-maker within the Party, eclipsing former party First Secretary Trường Chinh. By 1960, he was officially the second-most powerful party member, after party chairman Hồ. Throughout the 1960s Hồ's health declined and Lê Duẩn assumed more of his responsibilities. On 2 September 1969, Hồ died and Lê Duẩn became the most powerful figure in the North.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 1960s, forty-two per cent of Hercules flying hours {{were devoted to}} Australian Army operations. The C-130s {{undertook}} long-range missions to support Australian forces fighting in the Vietnam War from 1965 until 1972. Following the deployment of the 1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment to <b>South</b> <b>Vietnam</b> in early 1965, the RAAF began fortnightly C-130 flights into the country from June that year. These flights were initially conducted by C-130As, and carried high-priority cargo and passengers from Richmond to Vung Tau in <b>South</b> <b>Vietnam</b> via either Butterworth or Singapore. The scale of the supply flights into <b>South</b> <b>Vietnam</b> expanded in 1967 when No.2 Squadron RAAF, which was equipped with English Electric Canberra bombers, was deployed to Phan Rang. A large airlift codenamed Winter Grip was also conducted in mid-1967 to replace two Australian Army battalions, which had completed their year-long tour of duty, {{with a pair of}} fresh battalions. The Hercules were called upon to support the withdrawal of the 1st Australian Task Force (1ATF) from <b>South</b> <b>Vietnam,</b> and Nos.36 and 37 Squadrons undertook many sorties to fly equipment and personnel out of the country during 1971. In late 1972, C-130s were used to withdraw the last remaining Australian force in <b>South</b> <b>Vietnam,</b> the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam; the final elements of this force departed aboard two Hercules on 20December 1972.|$|E

5|$|North Vietnam {{continued}} {{to build up}} its combat units in <b>South</b> <b>Vietnam.</b> With the threat of U.S. airpower removed, the North Vietnamese military moved anti-aircraft units into <b>South</b> <b>Vietnam,</b> and deployed a sophisticated air-defence network that included the long-range SA-2 surface-to-air missile system, radar-guided anti-aircraft guns and the SA-7 Grail shoulder-launched missile The strong presence of North Vietnamese anti-aircraft units, which covered much of the northern provinces of <b>South</b> <b>Vietnam,</b> forced Republic of Vietnam Air Force reconnaissance and fighter aircraft to fly at higher altitudes to avoid being hit by surface-to-air missiles. Consequently, when North Vietnam went on the offensive again in 1975, the Republic of Vietnam Air Force was severely handicapped.|$|E

5|$|Northern Laos, however, was {{not going}} to be a {{priority}} for the Americans. It was decided at the Honolulu Executive Conference of April 1965 that U.S. aircraft could be used for interdiction in Laos only after close air support needs were met in <b>South</b> <b>Vietnam.</b> General Westmoreland was also granted veto power over bombing, interdiction, and reconnaissance programs outside territorial <b>South</b> <b>Vietnam.</b> That decision placed Barrel Roll behind <b>South</b> <b>Vietnam,</b> Rolling Thunder, and Steel Tiger in order of precedence.

In <b>South</b> <b>Vietnam</b> alone, an estimated 10 million hectares of agricultural land was ultimately destroyed. In some areas, TCDD concentrations in soil and water were hundreds of times greater than the levels considered safe by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.|$|E

5|$|As a result, {{the number}} of {{artillery}} tubes within <b>South</b> <b>Vietnam</b> increased to 430, including new 122mm and 130mm guns, while armored forces were estimated to have increased to 655 tanks and armored personnel carriers, including the new Soviet-built BTR-152. By the end of 1974, the North Vietnamese General Staff had created two army corps headquarters, matching South Vietnam's command and control structure in the I and II Corps Tactical Zones. Most independent North Vietnamese infantry regiments in the south were also combined into divisional structures. A U.S. Defense Attaché Office (established in 1973 to replace MACV, the 50 officers and men of the DAO coordinated all military assistance to <b>South</b> <b>Vietnam)</b> report concluded that the PAVN had increased their strategic reserve from two divisions to seven, making 70,000 additional troops available to augment the 200,000 combat and 100,000 support troops already in <b>South</b> <b>Vietnam.</b>|$|E
