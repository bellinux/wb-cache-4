500|$|Empire {{gave the}} film five stars out of five, commenting, [...] "You'll be lost for words." [...] Lisa Kennedy of the Denver Post gave the film full marks for its humane qualities and craftsmanship: [...] "It is an intelligent, winning drama {{fit for a}} king – {{and the rest of}} us", she <b>said.</b> <b>Roger</b> Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times awarded the film a full four stars, commenting that [...] "what {{we have here is a}} {{superior}} historical drama and a powerful personal one." [...] Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave four stars out of five, stating, [...] "Tom Hooper's richly enjoyable and handsomely produced movie... is a massively confident crowd-pleaser." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{are several}} [...] stories as to whom Ian Fleming {{personally}} wanted. Reportedly, Fleming favoured actor Richard Todd. In his autobiography When the Snow Melts, Cubby Broccoli <b>said</b> <b>Roger</b> Moore had been considered, {{but had been}} thought [...] "too young, perhaps a shade too pretty." [...] In his autobiography, My Word Is My Bond, Moore says he was never approached {{to play the role}} of Bond until 1973, for Live and Let Die. Moore appeared as Simon Templar on the television series The Saint, airing in the United Kingdom for the first time on 4 October 1962, only one day before the premiere of Dr. No.|$|E
500|$|The Cormans {{cast the}} film {{together}} with director Bernard L. Kowalski, who was 28 {{years old at}} the time. Kowalski also directed Roger Corman's Hot Car Girl. Night of the Blood Beast was one of Kowalski's first directorial credits and his first science fiction film, although he later went on to direct Attack of the Giant Leeches. For the Blood Beast cast, they mostly selected actors that had worked on other Roger Corman films. Michael Emmet had worked with Kowalski on the Western television series Boots and Saddles, where Kowalski directed most of the episodes Emmet had a major role in and was impressed with the actor's work ethic. Emmet later starred in the Roger Corman film Attack of the Giant Leeches. Ed Nelson also worked on several Roger Corman films, including Swamp Women (1955), Attack of the Crab Monsters (1957), Teenage Doll (1957) and She Gods of Shark Reef (1958). When asked what Nelson remembered about the film during a 2003 interview, he admitted, [...] "Not much", but he <b>said</b> <b>Roger</b> and Gene Corman were very knowledgeable about film and treated the material [...] "light-heartedly".|$|E
6000|$|... "I presumed {{the road}} {{would give a}} fair price for them," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Rogers,</b> winking his eyes in outward {{expression}} of inwardly blinking the point.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you’ll {{know whether}} she {{believes}} in it or not when you come back," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Rogers,</b> [...] "and it’ll be a great pity, because it’s a beautiful talker." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At eight o'clock, please," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Rogers,</b> rising, without {{apparent}} alarm at his threat, {{if it was}} a threat. [...] "And ask for me; I've taken a room at {{the hotel}} for the present." ...|$|R

2500|$|... "We totally {{support this}} show and applaud the show for doing this storyline," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Roger</b> Newcomb, a {{computer}} worker from New York's northern suburbs and {{the man behind the}} campaign. [...] "We just don't understand why they have to be censored or treated differently." [...] Newcomb found it unrealistic that Luke and Noah had not been shown kissing onscreen since their first kiss.|$|E
6000|$|... "G-w-r-r," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Roger</b> menacingly. The quivering limbs had {{a strange}} fascination for him, and coming closer he sniffed at them loudly.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall never}} see that bird again," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Rogers,</b> {{shaking his head}} as the Chief took up the cage {{and handed it to}} the steward, who was to {{accompany}} him home with it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't {{know what}} you would do," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Rogers</b> non-committally. [...] "I've come {{here to tell you}} that these parties stand ready to take the mills off your hands at a fair valuation--at the value I put upon them when I turned them in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We must be off," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Rogers,</b> [...] "or {{the whole}} Gorilla race may be down upon us." [...] "The little one is only {{shot in the}} leg," [...] I said. [...] "I'll bind the limb up, and we will carry the beast with us on board." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How d'ye do, Phil?" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Roger,</b> {{returning}} his cousinly {{shake of}} the hand with interest. [...] "What! are not you Philip Carey?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It’s {{going to}} be quite a trip,” <b>said</b> <b>Roger,</b> as he settled back to gaze at the swiftly-moving {{panorama}} of fields covered with snow.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a {{dangerous}} place in the winter time," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Roger.</b> [...] "We {{should have known better}} than to have retreated in that direction." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{you get in}} the way a bit," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Rogers</b> with secret enjoyment, [...] "you see you {{upset the}} arrangements. House-cleaning and all that sort of thing get interrupted. They're glad to see you back at first, and then glad to see the back of you." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{film was}} based on an {{original}} story by Stephen Longstreet. It was Ginger Rogers' first movie at RKO for a number of years. [...] "It's a very cute story," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Rogers.</b> [...] "It's for the whole family and I was delighted to make a family story." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I give it up," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Rogers.</b> [...] "The {{servants}} never {{expect me}} at this hour, and so they're all off on a lark. Might get along without the equerry and the page, but can't have any wine or cigars without the butler, and can't dress without my valet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come {{to think}} of it, that man does look like the little newsboy," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Roger,</b> slowly. [...] "Do you suppose they can be related?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{worry about}} that," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Roger,</b> {{with a wink}} at the others. [...] "I think I can scrape up some {{crackers}} and cheese somewhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't see {{anything}} of his majesty," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Roger,</b> {{in almost a}} whisper, for the strange adventure had set his nerves on an edge.|$|E
6000|$|Our native guide shrieked {{out some}} words in their language, of which Charles Rogers knew something. I {{thought it was}} the advance of the negroes whom we expected. [...] "No!" [...] <b>said</b> <b>Rogers</b> (who swore dreadfully in conversation), [...] "it is the Gorillas!" [...] And he fired both barrels of his gun, {{bringing}} down the little one first, and the female afterwards.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} were a sharper man, Gunn," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Rogers,</b> still in the same hot whisper, as he relaxed his grip a little; [...] "you are too simple, you hound! When you first {{threatened}} me I resolved to kill you. Then you threatened my daughter. I wish that you had nine lives, that I might take them all. Keep still!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They are Christian gentlemen," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Rogers.</b> [...] "But I don't purpose {{defending}} them; and I don't purpose {{telling you}} what I shall or shall not do with the property when it is in my hands again. The question is, Will you sell, and, if so, what is your figure? You have got nothing whatever {{to do with it}} after you've sold." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope he doesn't take us {{for game}} and shoot this way," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Roger,</b> {{who had heard}} of just such {{accidents}} more than once.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've got my {{electric}} torch with me," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Roger,</b> bringing that useful article from his pocket. [...] "We {{can use that}} in the cave." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Passmore, {{we want to}} ask {{you some}} questions," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Roger.</b> [...] "Do you know an elderly gentleman here by the name of Fordham?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So heartily," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Rogers</b> ('Table-Talk, etc.', pp. 281, 282), [...] "has [...] Moore repented {{of having}} {{published}} 'Little's Poems', that I have seen [...] him shed tears--tears of deep contrition--when {{we were talking}} of [...] them. Young ladies read his 'Lalla Rookh' without being aware (I [...] presume) of the grossness of 'The Veiled Prophet'. These lines by Mr. [...] Sneyd are amusing enough-- ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1936 Carl Rogers, {{the most}} {{influential}} psychologist in America after William James, invited Otto Rank to give a series of lectures in New York on Rank’s post-Freudian models of experiential and relational therapy. Rogers was transformed by these lectures and always credited Rank with having profoundly shaped [...] "client-centered" [...] therapy and the entire profession of counselling. [...] "I became infected with Rankian ideas," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Rogers</b> (Kramer, 1995).|$|R
5000|$|On June 12, 2013, the White House {{threatened}} {{to veto the}} MilCon/VA spending bill, because Republicans {{did not agree with}} the Senate's number of $1.058 trillions intended for military operations and research, after the MilCon/VA bill received 421 bipartisan votes in House.

6000|$|... "No," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Roger</b> {{loudly and}} explosively. [...] "Don't talk {{any more about}} that damned ghost. Nobody ever saw it. The whole story is balderdash." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quarter after four," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Roger,</b> {{consulting}} his watch. [...] "Bert, we {{can take}} you around the lake with ease before we start for home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “What are {{you going}} to do for the rest of the vacation, Dave?” <b>said</b> <b>Roger,</b> that evening. “You know you promised to come to my home.” ...|$|E
