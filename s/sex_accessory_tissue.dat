40|$|A {{full length}} cDNA clone {{encoding}} a mouse prostatic secretory glycoprotein (p 12) whose synthesis {{is dependent upon}} testicular androgens has been cloned and characterized. The predicted amino acid sequence of p 12 shares extensive homology with {{several members of the}} Kazal family of secretory protease inhibitors, in particular the pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitors. In agreement with sequence data, prostatic secretory p 12, purified from mouse ventral prostate secretion, exhibits anti-trypsin activity. Steady-state levels of protease inhibitor mRNA in ventral prostate are reduced from approximately 0. 06 % in normal mice to undetectable after androgen withdrawal but are inducible within 4 h by re-administration of testosterone. Androgen-dependent expression of the secretory protease inhibitor mRNA was also observed in coagulating gland and seminal vesicle. In seminal vesicle, a tissue of different embryonic origin to the prostate, the kinetics of secretory protease inhibitor mRNA loss after castration are not as rapid as in the ventral prostate and coagulating gland.

40|$|Functional {{development}} of the <b>sex</b> <b>accessory</b> <b>tissues</b> was studied in the male rat. Three potentially crucial developmental periods (neonatal, prepubertal and pubertal) were examined, and then the functional integrity of the <b>accessory</b> <b>tissues</b> was investigated in the adult, when the animals would {{have been expected to}} display normal function. Four <b>accessory</b> <b>tissues</b> (the seminal vesicles, ventral prostate and caput and cauda epididymides) were used because of their different embryological origins and responses to androgens in the adult. Synthesis and secretion of previously characterized tissue-specific androgen-dependent proteins were taken as indicators of normal function. Development was perturbed by using oestradiol benzoate, since this was known to affect gross {{development of}} the seminal vesicles and ventral prostate when given to neonatal rats. Treatment during the first 5 days after birth severely restricted {{development of the}} seminal vesicles and ventral prostate. Protein secreted by the former was only 1 % of the normal amount, and in many cases several major secretory proteins were essentially missing. Prostatic protein secretion was less than 20 % of normal, but all the major proteins were detectable. In both tissues overall protein synthesis per cell was quantitatively normal, but the proportion devoted to specific major secretory proteins was markedly depressed, i. e. the response is differential. In contrast, treatment during the prepubertal period was without noticeable effects. Development of the seminal vesicles and prostate was somewhat inhibited by treatment at puberty, but these changes were minor compared with those after neonatal exposure to oestradiol benzoate. No effects on epididymal protein synthesis or secretory proteins were observed, and epididymal weight and DNA content were only moderately decreased regardless of when oestradiol benzoate was administered during sexual maturation. Hence the neonatal period is not so critical for epididymal development. The substantial changes elicited by oestrogen treatment during neonatal life in seminal-vesicle and prostatic protein synthesis and secretion were compared with those evoked in sexually mature males by either oestrogen treatment or castration. Both these latter treatments resulted in a general decrease in seminal-vesicle protein synthesis and secretion, but the marked differential effects on major proteins after neonatal exposure were absent. Castration did, however, evoke a differential prostatic response, but this was not seen after oestrogen treatment of adults...|$|R
40|$|Androgens, in {{particular}} dihydrotestosterone (DHT), are crucial {{for maintaining the}} structure and functions (sperm maturation and storage) of the epididymis. DHT is synthesized from testosterone by steroid 5 alpha-reductase (Srd 5 aR) type 1 and type 2. Srd 5 aR 1 and srd 5 aR 2 have different tissue-specific distribution patterns and distinct genetic and biochemical properties. Srd 5 aR 2 mRNA is more abundant than that of srd 5 aR 1 in several <b>sex</b> <b>accessory</b> <b>tissues,</b> most dramatically in the epididymis, where it is predominantly expressed in the caput region. The two main objectives of this thesis are to elucidate the transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of srd 5 aR 2 in the rat epididymis and to identify androgen-dependent genes in epididymal principal cells. In the first objective, the 5 'upstream region of srd 5 aR 2 was cloned and analyzed. The gene's transcriptional start site was localized, regulatory elements and the core promoter were mapped, and the transcription factors SP 1, {{and to a lesser}} extent SP 3, were found to interact with srd 5 aR 2 in the rat caput epididymidis and mouse proximal caput epididymidis (PC- 1) cell line. The epigenetic regulation of srd 5 aR 2 by DNA methylation was subsequently examined and contrasted to that of srd 5 aRl in tissues where the isozymes are differentially expressed. DNA methylation levels fluctuated along the 5 'upstream region of both genes. Tissue-specific variations in adenine and cytosine methylation were also identified for srd 5 aR 1 and srd 5 aR 2, respectively. These studies constitute the first analysis of the 5 'upstream region of srd 5 aR 2, at both the transcriptional and epigenetic levels. In the second objective, the direct effects of androgens on principal cell gene expression were examined in PC- 1 cells. The majority of androgen-regulated genes displayed an early or late transient increase in expression levels following androgen withdrawal. When DHT was added back to the media, a differential ability of rescue was seen among androgen-regulated genes depending on time of supplementation. This rescue ability was severely compromised after 4 days of androgen deprivation. These results provide novel insights into the response of principal cells to androgens. Together, the two objectives of this thesis impart greater understanding into the mechanisms of androgen action in the epididymis...|$|R

40|$|This review aims to {{evaluate}} the contribution of individual cell-selective knockout models to our current understanding of androgen action. Cre/loxP technology has allowed the generation of cell-selective knockout models targeting the androgen receptor (AR) in distinct putative target cells {{in a wide variety}} of organs and tissues including: testis, ovary, <b>accessory</b> <b>sex</b> <b>tissues,</b> muscle, bone, fat, liver, skin and myeloid tissue. In some androgen-regulated processes such as spermatogenesis and folliculogenesis this approach has lead to the identification of a key cellular mediator of androgen action (Sertoli and granulosa cells, respectively). In many target tissues, however, the final response to androgens appears to be more complex. Here, cell-selective knockout technology offers a platform upon which we can begin to unravel the more complex interplay and signaling pathways of androgens. A prototypic example is the analysis of mesenchymal-epithelial interactions in many <b>accessory</b> <b>sex</b> glands. Furthermore, for some actions of testosterone, in which part of the effect is mediated by the active metabolite 17 β-estradiol, conditional knockout technology offers a novel strategy to study the relative contribution of AR and estrogen receptor-mediated signaling. The latter approach has already resulted in a better understanding of androgen action in brain and bone. Finally, cell-selective knockout technology has generated valuable models to search for AR-controlled molecular mediators of androgen action, a strategy that has successfully been applied to the study of androgen action in the testis and in the epididymis. Although some conditional knockout models have provided clear answers to physiologic questions, it should be noted that others have pointed to unexpected complexities or technical limitations confounding interpretation of the results. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|During the 10 th week of {{gestation}} human prostate {{development is}} about to start. Androgens are the crucial factors to stimulate the initial interactions between the epithelium and mesenchyme. One of the key events in androgen metabolism is the transformation of circulating testosterone to 5 α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by tissue-linked 5 α-reductase. Both, {{the formation of a}} male phenotype and the androgen-mediated growth of the prostate are mediated by DHT. To date the function of 5 α-reductase 1 (5 αR 1) still remains unclear whereas 5 α-reductase 2 (5 αR 2) {{is supposed to be the}} predominant isoenzyme in human <b>accessory</b> <b>sex</b> <b>tissue.</b> Only little data are available on the detection, distribution, and effects of both isoenzymes during fetal life and infancy. Recently, immunohistochemical investigations of serial sections from fetuses and infants using specific antibodies directed against 5 αR 1 and 5 αR 2 seem to shed light on that issue. Moreover, the detection of downstream products of androgen synthesis using RT-PCR analyses for 17 -β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase Type 2 (17 βHSD 2), 17 βHSD Type 3 and 17 βHSD Type 7 adds to discovering the molecular biological background. New studies confirm that both isoenzymes are present throughout fetal development.

The animal has a single breeding season which occurs during the winter months. Spermatogensis commences in August, followed immediately by a period of speriogenesis; producing nature sperm, which are shed into the epididymides and vas deferens prior to the time ovulation occurs in the female. Interstitial cells were seen to develop and regress with the waxing and waving of the <b>sex</b> <b>accessories</b> and secondary sexual characters. These <b>sex</b> <b>accessories</b> were demonstrated {{to be under the}} influence of the male sex hormone, testosterone.

40|$|Many {{physiological}} {{processes in}} organisms are regulated by {{a relatively small}} number of steroid honnones. Androgens are the so-called male sex steroid hormones which control growth, differentiation and functions of male reproductive and <b>accessory</b> <b>sex</b> <b>tissues.</b> Androgens are mainly produced in the testis and circulate in the blood. They diffuse in and out of all cells, but are retained with high affinity and specificity in target cells by an intranuclear binding protein, termed the androgen receptor. Once bound by androgens, the androgen receptor undergoes a conformational change allowing the receptor to bind with high affinity to DNA and to modulate transcription of certain genes. The androgen receptor appears to be a transcription factor, regulated by androgenic steroids. Phosphorylation is the predominant cellular mechanism for reversible modification of proteins, and the fact that many transcription factors are phosphoproteins suggests a regulatory role of phosphorylation. In this thesis, studies on phosphorylation of the androgen receptor in human prostate tumor cells (LNCaP) are described. In LNCaP cells, the androgen receptor protein is present as two isofonlls with apparent molecular masses of 110 and 112 kDa during SDS-PAGE. The 112 kDa isoform reflects the phosphorylated receptor, whereas the 110 kDa isoform is the non-phosphorylated receptor. Both isoforms are able to bind androgens with high affinity and can subsequently be transformed to the DNA binding form. It appears to be unlikely that phosphorylation is involved in the regulation of steroid- or DNA binding affinity. Upon incubation of the prostate tumor cells with androgens, the phosphOlylation degree of the androgen receptor was rapidly increased. Multiple phosphorylation sites on serine residues are located in the N-terminal f/'al/~activation domain and not in the DNA- and ligand binding domains. Tryptic phosphopeptide maps of the androgen receptor show induction of phosphorylation at a novel site(s) by hormone treatment. It is proposed that this extra phosphorylation in the N-terminal domain causes a conformational change, enabling protein-protein contacts of the trails-activation domain with other transcription factors or co-activators on a target gene promoter...|$|R

50|$|The genetic sex is {{determined}} by whether a Y bearing or next bearing sperm fertilizes the open; {{the presence or absence}} of a Y chromosome in turn determines whether the gonads of the embryo will be testes or ovaries; and {{the presence or absence of}} testes, finally, determines whether the <b>sex</b> <b>accessory</b> organs and external genitalia will be male or female. This sequence is understandable in light of the fact that both male and female embryos develop within the maternal environment - high in estrogen secreted by the mother’s ovaries and the placenta. If estrogen determined the gender, all embryos would become feminized.|$|R
5|$|A {{good example}} of {{convergence}} in plants is the evolution of edible fruits such as apples. These pomes incorporate (five) carpels and their <b>accessory</b> <b>tissues</b> forming the apple's core, surrounded by structures from outside the botanical fruit, the receptacle or hypanthium. Other edible fruits include other plant tissues; for example, the fleshy part of a tomato is {{the walls of the}} pericarp. This implies convergent evolution under selective pressure, in this case the competition for seed dispersal by animals through consumption of fleshy fruits.|$|R
40|$|The {{role of the}} Hox gene Hoxd- 13 in {{postnatal}} morphogenesis of {{the male}} <b>accessory</b> <b>sex</b> organs was examined by correlating the distribution and temporal regulation of expression in the <b>accessory</b> <b>sex</b> organs of postnatal mice with morphologic abnormalities of Hoxd- 13 -deficient transgenic mice. Previous studies of Hoxd- 13 expression in the perinatal period have shown a broad domain of expression in the lower genitourinary tract, with expression in both mesenchyme and epithelium; focal expression was also noted in the epithelium of the nascent ducts of the developing prostate. Quantitative RT-PCR studies of Hoxd- 13 expression in the 5 day mouse confirm widespread expression in the <b>accessory</b> <b>sex</b> organs developing from both the Wolffian duct and the urogenital sinus. Expression is down-regulated with age, and a detailed time course of expression in the developing prostate shows {{that the level of}} Hoxd- 13 expression correlates with morphogenetic activity {{in the development of the}} prostate ductal system. Transgenic Hoxd- 13 -deficient mice display multiple abnormalities in the male <b>accessory</b> <b>sex</b> organs. The most severe abnormalities were observed in organs exhibiting ductal branching during postnatal development and included diminished mesenchymal folding in the seminal vesicles, decreased size and diminished ductal branching in the ventral and dorsal prostate, and agenesis of the bulbourethral gland. We conclude that Hoxd- 13 expression in the postnatal period correlates with a period of intense morphogenetic activity in <b>accessory</b> <b>sex</b> organ development and that the function of Hoxd- 13 is evidenced by morphologic abnormalities in <b>accessory</b> <b>sex</b> organs of the Hoxd- 13 -deficient mutant...|$|R
5|$|The major {{means of}} {{respiration}} in teleosts, {{as in most}} other fish, is the transfer of gases {{over the surface of}} the gills as water is drawn in through the mouth and pumped out through the gills. Apart from the swim bladder, which contains a small amount of air, the body does not have oxygen reserves, and respiration needs to be continuous over the fish's life. Some teleosts exploit habitats where the oxygen availability is low, such as stagnant water or wet mud; they have developed <b>accessory</b> <b>tissues</b> and organs to support gas exchange in these habitats.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a case of}} right axillary lymph node metastasis of an occult infiltrating lobular carcinoma arising from accessory mammary gland of the left upper anterior chest wall. Ultrasonography and mammography were normal bilaterally. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 3. 34 cm inhomogeneous lesion. Then, core biopsy under ultrasound guidance demonstrated a typical infiltrating breast lobular carcinoma. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} case reported in the literature of an axillary lymph node metastasis from an occult contralateral infiltrating lobular carcinoma of the <b>accessory</b> breast <b>tissue.</b> MRI was useful for assessing the lesion of the <b>accessory</b> breast <b>tissue...</b>|$|R
