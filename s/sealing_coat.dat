40|$|Porosity and {{permeability}} {{are both}} parameters {{which may have}} a considerable impact {{on the characteristics of}} a volcanic eruption. Various processes, from magmatic flow during ascent to the point of magmatic fragmentation during an explosive eruption are influenced, and sometimes even controlled by the amount of volatiles trapped in a magma’s pore space and by the efficiency of their escape. Detailed investigations of the porosity of pyroclastic rocks and its relation to the gas permeability are therefore crucial for the understanding of such processes and may provide an important database for physical models. The combination of experimental work and field investigation represents in this context an effective approach to obtain a statistically relevant amount of data on the one hand, and, on the other hand, experimentally quantify the correlation between different parameters. For this study, density data of pyroclastic deposits from eight circum-pacific volcanoes were recalculated to porosity values using the determined matrix density of the corresponding rocks. The pyroclasts density was determined directly in the field with a method based on the Archimedean principle; the matrix density was determined in the laboratory using a He-Pycnometer. The comparison of the resulting porosity distribution histograms allows (a) the investigation of local features related to depositional mechanisms, if the distribution of single measurement points is evaluated, and (b) statements about large scale coherencies regarding the eruptive style and the explosivity of a volcano, if the compiled datasets of the volcanoes are compared. The shape and the variance of the distribution curves, as well as the positions of the porosity peak or mean porosity values are parameters {{that can be used for}} further interpretation. The differences in the porosity distribution patterns allowed the classification of the investigated volcanoes into three groups, corresponding to their eruptive characteristics: (1) dome-building volcanoes with predominantly block-and-ash-flow activity and occasional Vulcanian explosions (Merapi, Unzen, Colima), (2) cryptodome-forming volcanoes with a subsequent lateral-blast eruption (Bezymianny, Mount St. Helens), and (3) Subplinian to Plinian explosive eruptions (Krakatau, Kelut, Augustine). Furthermore, possible coherencies between the mean porosity values of selected eruptions and their explosivity, expressed in two different explosivity indexes, were evaluated. The ‘Volcanic Explosivity Index’ (VEI), introduced by Newhall & Self (1982), is mainly based on the volume of the erupted tephra, and shows a rough positive correlation to the mean porosity of eruptive products. A qualitative enhancement of this correlation, especially considering low-porosity, low-explosive deposits, was achieved by using the measured porosity values to determine the index of the ‘Eruption Magnitude’, introduced by Pyle 1995. Volcanoes with not only pure explosive (Vulcanian and/or Plinian) activity were found to deviate systematically from this correlation. Besides their relevance for the understanding and modeling of eruption physics, the interpretation of porosity data may help to discriminate eruption characteristics and explosivities also at historic and pre-historic eruption deposits. The main focus of this work was the experimental investigation of the gas permeability of volcanic rocks. In order to simulate degassing processes under strongly transient conditions, the experiments were performed on a shock-tube like apparatus. The permeability of a natural porous material depends on a complex mixture of physical and textural parameters. Evidently, the volume fraction of the materials pore space, i. e. its porosity, is one of the prominent factors controlling permeable gas flow. But, as a high scatter of measured permeability values for a given porosity indicates, it seems that parameters like vesicle sizes, vesicle size distribution, vesicle shape, the degree of interconnectivity et cetera may likewise influence filtration properties. Therefore it is almost impossible to predict the permeability development of natural material with theoretical cause-and-effect relations, and experimental work in this field is essential. By performing more than 360 gas filtration experiments on 112 different samples from 13 volcanoes, a comprehensive permeability and porosity database was created with this study, giving rise to profound empirical as well as quantitative investigations. The dependency of porosity and permeability of volcanic rocks was found to follow two different, but overlapping trends, according to the geometries of the gas-flow providing pore-space: at low porosities (i. e. long-term degassed dome rocks), gas escape occurs predominantly through microcracks or elongated micropores and therefore could be described by simplified forms of capillary (Kozeny-Carman relations) and fracture flow models. At higher porosities, the influence of vesicles becomes progressively stronger as they form an increasingly connected network. Therefore, a model based on the percolation theory of fully penetrable spheres was used, as a first approximation, to describe the permeability-porosity trend. To investigate possible influences of high temperatures on the degassing properties of volcanic rocks, a measuring method that allowed permeability experiments at temperatures up to 750 °C was developed and tested. A <b>sealing</b> <b>coat</b> of compacted NaCl, which was, if required, further compressed during the high-T experiment, was found to be the most promising approach to avoid gas leaking due to different thermal expansivities of the materials involved. The results of three dome rock samples showed distinct lower gas filtration rates at high temperatures. As this may, for the largest part, be attributed to changed gas properties at high temperature, the obtained permeability values must be corrected for the enhanced gas viscosity. The corrected permeability values of the samples were higher than those obtained at room temperature, possibly caused by thermal expansion of the pores. Since, however, compressional forces of the salt coating upon the sample cylinder may lower the permeability particularly of highly fractured rocks to a not quantifyable degree, these results must be interpreted accordingly and seen under certain restrictions. Comparison of the permeability values before and after the heating process revealed that no permanent structural changes in the pore network occurred. This was confirmed by a 5 h-experiment on a trachytic sample, with permeability tests in an interval of 60 minutes. The influence of permeability on magmatic fragmentation is of special interest for the modelling of eruptive processes. In particular the ‘fragmentation threshold’, i. e. the physical conditions, at which magma is no longer able to reduce gas overpressure by filtration and fragments, represents an important boundary condition for explosive eruption models. Former studies defined this threshold to depend on either the porosity of the magma, or a combination of porosity and overpressure. The experimental results of this work, however, reveal that, in addition to porosity and applied overpressure, the permeability strongly influences the fragmentation threshold. By quantifying this influence in a simple, analytical equation, these results will provide a valuable tool for physical models of eruption mechanics...|$|E

40|$|This project {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> materials and design method. The primary objectives of this research are 1) to evaluate <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> performance from various combinations of aggregates and emulsions in terms of aggregate loss; 2) to evaluate how the properties of aggregates and emulsions affect <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> performance; 3) to evaluate current <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> design methods based on INDOT <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> practice; and 4) to develop <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> design software incorporating Indiana practice. To evaluate the effects of aggregate and emulsion types on aggregate loss performance of <b>seal</b> <b>coat,</b> three emulsions and eight aggregates including CRS- 2 P, RS- 2 P, and AE- 90 S for emulsions and Trap Rock, Sandstone, Blast Furnace Slag, Steel Slag, Limestone, Dolomite, Crushed Gravel (one face), and Crushed Gravel (two faces) were tested utilizing the sweep test and Vialit test. In addition, to explore influential factors (i. e., electrical surface charge interaction, water evaporation change in emulsion, water affinity of aggregate, etc.), the Zeta potential, water content, and X-ray deflection (XRD) tests were also conducted. According to the Zeta potential test results, the electrical surface charge of an aggregate in emulsions varies {{with the type of}} emulsion (i. e., with the pH of the emulsifier). From the water content test, among the emulsions, CRS- 2 P was the earliest emulsion to have enough bond strength to retain aggregates in open traffic. In addition, aggregate can retard the water evaporation process of emulsions. Based on the XRD test results, Sandstone and Dolomite have the highest and smallest content of SiO 2, respectively among the eight aggregates. This means that Sandstone and Limestone have the highest and lowest water affinity (hydrophilic and hydrophobic), respectively. In the sweep test with Limestone with various curing time, CRS- 2 P showed superior aggregate loss performance among the emulsions. Comparing the sweep test results to the water contents of emulsions, faster water evaporation presented better aggregate loss performance. This finding indicates that the bond strength of emulsion to retain aggregate can be mainly a function of water evaporation in emulsion. Based on the sweep test at 77 ˚F after 24 hours of curing, CRS- 2 P performed the best regardless of aggregate type. The Vialit test at a temperature range of 35 °F to - 22 F° after 24 hours of curing shows the most aggregate loss at lower testing temperatures. AE- 90 S had the strongest resistance in losing aggregate among the three emulsions at lower temperatures, which is an opposite trend comparing to the sweep test results. Also, Crushed Gravel with two faces outperformed Crushed Gravbel with one face. According to statistical analysis results, it was concluded that AE- 90 S and Crushed Gravel with two faces showed the best performance among the emulsions and aggregates, respectively. In addition the best-performing aggregate-emulsion combinations were AE- 90 S with most of the aggregates, except for Steel Slag. Thus, the aggregate type in terms of mineral/chemical composition is not a major factor affecting the aggregate loss performance. To develop a <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> design, <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> performance was evaluated for various emulsion (EAR) and aggregate application rates (AAR) by using three different evaluation methods: the IRI, friction, and visual inspection. Based on these performance tests, immediate failure occurring locally during construction due to incorrect application rate (e. g., insufficient aggregate rate) can cause total failure of the <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> road resulting from a chain reaction. Employing a factor to compensate for AAR discrepancies between target and actual is critical for <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> survival during construction. This study confirms the irrelevance of <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> application to IRI values due to the thin coat and the limitation of the IRI measurement (e. g., 250 mm moving average). The friction test results show an adequate skid resistance performance on all <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> test sections. In addition, friction improvements due to <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> applications were confirmed within a range of <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> rates applied in this study. Overall, IRI, friction, and visual inspection did not show distinct differences in <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> performance in terms of application rates. A methodology in selecting an equipment factor for correcting any difference between a target rate and a measured rate was developed considering reliability and a designed rate using the McLeod equation. Design software, “INDOT <b>SEAL</b> <b>COAT</b> DESIGN (iSeal) ”, was developed as part of the study to aid the <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> design process and incorporates INDOT <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> practice. The software was largely based on the McLeod design method which includes factors that the INDOT <b>seal</b> <b>coat</b> specification lacks. Furthermore, an additional factor, an equipment factor, was implemented into the design process to resolve issues due to discrepancies between designed rate and applied rate...|$|R

These are: (1) whether and how much routine maintenance {{has an impact on}} the pavement 2 ̆ 7 s serviceability and/or expected service life; (2) whether <b>seal</b> <b>coating</b> practice is cost-effective, and what is the optimal timing for this activity; and (3) what directions, principles and criteria should be used for chip and sand <b>seal</b> <b>coating</b> activities on Indiana state highway system. ^ The first issue was evaluated using before/after statistical comparisons; the means of indicators for groups of roadway sections receiving maintenance and groups not receiving maintenance were compared to determine if the differences in the means were statistically significant. The results were subjected to engineering judgement in order to verify if the conclusions are justifiable or not. General linear regression models were then used to quantify the impacts. The second issue was evaluated by using a life cycle costing approach. The costs included in the evaluation covered annual routine maintenance costs, <b>seal</b> <b>coating</b> costs, and resurfacing costs at the end of lifecycle. The third issue was dealt with utilizing a number of techniques: an expert opinion survey, a comparative evaluation of practices in other jurisdictions, and telephone interviews and focused group discussions. ^ Testing of significance yielded three groups of findings: the first group contained activities that demonstrated a 2 ̆ 2 definitely significant 2 ̆ 2 impact on either roughness measurements, pavement serviceability ratings, or both; the second group, activities that demonstrated a 2 ̆ 2 marginally significant 2 ̆ 2 impact on the condition indicators listed above; and the third, activities that could not be confirmed either way. ^ Life cycle costing illustrated that <b>seal</b> <b>coating</b> is more of a stop-gap measure allowing greater flexibility in capital spending than a cost-effective solution to problems. ^ The developed policy guidelines included a general statement on when and where <b>seal</b> <b>coating</b> should be applied; a set of principles that defined which types of roads should receive priority; and a decision tree to assist in making decisions on specific projects. ^ The study recommended a three finger strategy for the improved definition of the effectiveness of maintenance activities.

This research project investigated ways to improve Iowa Statewide Urban Design and Specifications (SUDAS) and Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) documents regarding asphalt roadway maintenance and rehabilitation. Researchers led an effort to review and help ensure that the documents supporting proper selection, design, and construction for asphalt maintenance and rehabilitation techniques reflect the latest research findings on these processes: <b>seal</b> <b>coating,</b> slurry <b>sealing,</b> micro-surfacing, and fog sealing. Full results of this investigation are included in this report and its appendices. This report also presents {{a summary of the}} recommendations based on the study results...|$|R
