5|$|In {{response}} to the increasing international pressure, Goukouni stated that Libyan forces were in Chad by government request, and that international mediators <b>should</b> <b>accept</b> the decision of Chad's legitimate government. In a meeting held in May, Goukouni became more accommodating, declaring that while Libyan withdrawal was not a priority, he would accept {{the decisions of the}} OAU. Goukouni could not at the time renounce Libyan military support, necessary for dealing with Habré's FAN, which was supported by Egypt and Sudan and funded through Egypt by the US Central Intelligence Agency.|$|E
5|$|The French were {{initially}} opposed to Albani's election, but they quickly dropped {{their opposition to}} him. He was elected unanimously on 23 November 1700. He was unsure whether he <b>should</b> <b>accept</b> the papacy {{due to the fact}} that he had nephews who he suspected would be angry if he followed the bull on nepotism. He was eventually convinced to accept the papacy by theologians who told him that not accepting an unanimous election would not be following the Holy Spirit.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert surveils Watts, {{finding that}} the latter has {{been in contact with}} Means. Black travels to where Means is living, where he {{remotely}} observes a cult-like ceremony in which Means is ritually inducted into the Group. He contacts Watts, divulging the results of his tests—they were injected with a vaccine while quarantined. Black warns Watts that the Group is dangerous; Watts neither confirms nor denies this, but predicts the arrival of an earthquake, urging Black that should this prediction come to pass, he <b>should</b> <b>accept</b> full membership of the Group. That night, Black answers a telephone call from Means, who tells him that the Group mean no harm. The line suddenly cuts, and the tremors of an earthquake begin just as Watts had predicted. Black moves through his home, noticing that his pet bird is dead in its cage, covered in blood.|$|E

5|$|The {{young man}} was not certain if he <b>should</b> <b>accept</b> the offer Freddy Carlone had made, so he {{returned}} to Canonsburg to talk the matter over with his father. Perry expected he would tell {{him to stay in}} the barber business, but to his surprise, the senior Como told him if he did not take the opportunity, he might never know whether or not he could be a professional singer. The decision was also made with an eye on finances; Como earned around $125 per week from his barber shop while the job with Carlone paid $28 per week. Roselle was willing to travel with her husband and the band, but the salary was not enough to support two people on the road. Perry and Roselle were married in Meadville on July 31, 1933; four days later, Como joined Freddy Carlone's band and began working with them. Roselle returned home to Canonsburg; her new husband would be on the road for the next 18 months.|$|E
5|$|William {{held the}} prebendary of Weighton in {{the diocese of}} Yorkshire between 27 June 1109 and 24 February 1114. Sometime between 1109 and 1114 he was {{appointed}} Treasurer of York. He was also appointed archdeacon of the East Riding of Yorkshire at an unknown date between 1125 and 1133. The influence of his rich and powerful father, who had many landholdings in Yorkshire may have been of benefit in gaining him these offices at a relatively early age. William apparently held both of these offices until his election as archbishop. Serving under Archbishop Thurstan of York, William became involved in Thurstan's dispute with King Henry I after Henry demanded that the Archbishops of York <b>should</b> <b>accept</b> subordination to the Archbishops of Canterbury. William accompanied Thurstan into exile in Europe and on embassies to the papal court. Reconciliation with Henry allowed a return to York in 1121. A papal ruling in favour of {{the independence of the}} Archbishops of York was finally delivered in 1127.|$|E
