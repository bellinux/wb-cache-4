50|$|Steel was {{introduced}} to the construction industry {{at the end of the}} 19th century. The development of structural steel in the mid-19th century allowed construction of tall buildings. Builders and manufacturers turned to steel, which was stronger than cast iron in compression and wrought iron in tension. When the Bessemer process was developed in England in 1856, and the open-hearth process was invented, steel was produced in a quantity that allowed it to be economical. Bridges, railroad companies, and skyscrapers were among the first large-scale uses of structural steel. Although iron and steel are not combustible, they lose strength in a fire if they are not protected from the heat. Almost all structural steel must be “fireproofed” in some manner, utilizing a cladding of terra-cotta, tile, plaster-poured concrete, sprayed concrete, or <b>sprayed</b> <b>insulation.</b> Ferro concrete, also called reinforced concrete, was developed in the late 19th century when steel wire was added to concrete.|$|E

40|$|DOE sites {{contain a}} broad {{spectrum}} of asbestos materials (cloth, pipe lagging, <b>sprayed</b> <b>insulation</b> and other substances) which are contaminated with a combination of hazardous and radioactive wastes due to its use during the development of the US nuclear weapons complex. These wastes consist of cutting oils, lubricants, solvents, PCBs, heavy metals and radioactive contaminants. The radioactive contaminants are the activation, decay, and fission products of DOE operations. To allow disposal, the asbestos must be converted chemically, followed by removing and separating the hazardous and radioactive materials to prevent the formation of mixed wastes and to allow for both sanitary disposal and effective decontamination. Currently, no technology exists that can meet these sanitary and other objectives. An attempt was made to apply techniques that have already proved successful in the mining, oil, and metals processing industries {{to the development of a}} multi-stage process to remove and separate hazardous chemical radioactive materials from asbestos. This process uses three methods: ABCOV chemicals which converts the asbestos to a sanitary waste; dielectric heating to volatilize the organic materials; and electrochemical processing for the removal of heavy metals, RCRA wastes and radionuclides. This process will result in the destruction of over 99 % of the asbestos; limit radioactive metal contamination to 0. 2 Bq alpha per gram and 1 Bq beta and gamma per gram; reduce hazardous organics to levels compatible with current EPA policy for RCRA delisting; and achieve TCLP limits for all solidified waste...|$|E

50|$|The LH2 {{tank was}} {{constructed}} of six cylinders: five were 2.4 meters {{high and the}} sixth 0.69 meter high. The biggest challenge was the insulation. Liquid hydrogen must be kept colder than about 20 °C above absolute zero (20 K or &minus;252 °C or &minus;423 °F) so good insulation is very important. Initial attempts did not work well: there were bonding issues and air pockets. The final method was to <b>spray</b> <b>insulation</b> on by hand and trim the excess. The LH2 tank volume was 1182 cu.m. (260,000 gal.) for storing 69,400 kg (153,000 lbs) of liquid hydrogen.|$|R

5000|$|Polyurethane is a {{closed-cell}} {{foam insulation}} material that initially contains a low-conductivity gas in its cells.

40|$|A new modular {{insulation}} panel {{technology for}} insulating reefer vans is proposed that can {{solve some of}} the problems of traditional methods.

The present method suggests prefabricating of modular insulation panels with accurate size in controlled conditions instead of <b>spraying</b> <b>insulation</b> foam inside the vehicles. In addition, the installation method of modular panels enables the operators to replace the damaged parts of insulation easily with less cost instead of changing the whole insulation in the old method.

According to the Department of Defense (DOD), forward-deployed generators, used to provide power to base support activities, are the largest single consumer of fuel throughout the battlefield. Eighty percent of the energy provided by generators is assessed to power environmental control units that run incessantly due to the poor insulating properties of the structures, according to a 2010 study conducted by the Department of the Air Force Civil Engineer Support Agency. Recent DOD policy has focused more on energy use and consumption but fails to address, and provide solutions for, major consumers of fuel throughout the battlefield. The incorporation of closed-cell, <b>spray</b> foam <b>insulation</b> into legacy DOD forward-deployed construction practices yields a significant return on investment, short-payback/break-even period, and reduces mission and personnel risk to deployed military forces.

However, there have been isolated moisture related incidents reported anecdotally that raise potential concerns about the overall hygrothermal performance of these systems. The incidents related to rainwater leakage and condensation concerns. Condensation concerns have been extensively studied by others and are not further discussed in this report. This project involved hygrothermal modeling {{of a range of}} rainwater leakage and field evaluations of in-service residential roofs using <b>spray</b> foam <b>insulation.</b> All of the roof assemblies modeled exhibited drying capacity to handle minor rainwater leakage. All field evaluation locations of in-service residential roofs had moisture contents well within the safe range for wood-based sheathing. Explorations of eleven in-service roof systems were completed. The exploration involved taking a sample of spray foam from the underside of the roof sheathing, exposing the sheathing, then taking a moisture content reading. All locations had moisture contents well within the safe range for wood-based sheathing. One full-roof failure was reviewed, as an industry partner was involved with replacing structurally failed roof sheathing. In this case the manufacturer's investigation report concluded that the spray foam was installed on wet OSB based on the observation that the spray foam did not adhere well to the substrate and the pore structure of the closed cell spray foam at the ccSPF/OSB interface was indicative of a wet substrate...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{application}} of robotics in a new field for applying surface treatments in building voids {{and the development of}} the architecture of the robotic vehicle for use in this application. The nature of the application means that the robotic vehicle must be capable of accessing voids through small openings and this has led to a deployable architecture for the vehicle which can be fed through an opening and then reconfigures its form to enable practical operation. A typical application for the robot is to apply thermal insulation to the underside of wooden or concrete floors in buildings. The terrain is varied ranging from sand to impacted dusty hard core, can be strewn with builders’ debris such as bricks and timber, and is interspersed with retainer walls that support the floor above.

40|$|This paper summarises {{the effects}} of climate change and the {{effectiveness}} of measures to combat it which are based on improving the energy efficiency of buildings. It promotes the greater use of polyurethane rigid foam as capable of providing a significant contribution to reducing CO 2 emissions. Climate change is recognised as a major and long term threat to the planet and international agreements have been sought to take the first steps to address the issue. Concrete measures have been taken in the European Union to target the energy efficiency of buildings because they are major contributors to CO 2 emissions and also because there are several references which show that these measures are very cost competitive compared to other measures to reduce CO 2 emissions. Figure 1 : Steel frame factory construction with PU-cored sandwich panels The extreme versatility of polyurethane rigid foam lends itself to the insulation of new buildings and to the renovation of existing buildings. The main conclusions are: • A significant reduction in the emissions of CO 2 can be achieved by improving the insulation standards in new and existing buildings. This can be achieved with existing technologies. Amongst {{the most important of these}} is the range of polyurethane rigid foam technologies and products. These are very versatile and can be applied to all buildings new or old, and are adaptable to the building styles and practices across Europe [...] The cost efficiency of PUR insulation foam applications is very high compared to other materials and ranks very highly when based on the cost per ton of CO 2 emissions saved.
