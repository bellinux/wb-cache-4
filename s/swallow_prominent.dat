50|$|The <b>Swallow</b> <b>Prominent</b> (Pheosia tremula) is a moth {{from the}} family Notodontidae.|$|E
50|$|The {{host plant}} of the <b>Swallow</b> <b>Prominent</b> are the poplar, {{especially}} the aspen, the willow and the birch. For detailed list see Robinson, G. S., P. R. Ackery, I. J. Kitching, G. W. Beccaloni & L. M. Hern√°ndez, 2010.|$|E
5000|$|The imago can {{be easily}} {{confused}} with Pheosia tremula but gnoma is usually smaller, and the ground colour has usually less brown in it; the chief character by which it may be distinguished is the broader and clearer white wedge-shaped mark between veins one and two on the fore wings of gnoma.The host plant of the Lesser <b>Swallow</b> <b>Prominent</b> is the birch- [...] Betula (British Isles), Betula pendula (Finland) Betula pubescens (Finland).|$|E
25|$|Wilson's disease (WD) {{is a rare}} {{inherited}} {{disorder in}} which patients have a problem metabolizing copper. In patients with WD, copper accumulates in the liver {{and other parts of}} the body, particularly the brain, eyes and kidneys. Upon accumulation in the brain, patients may experience speech problems, incoordination, <b>swallowing</b> problems, and <b>prominent</b> hyperkinetic symptoms including tremor, dystonia, and gait difficulties. Psychiatric disturbances such as irritability, impulsiveness, aggressiveness, and mood disturbances are also common.|$|R
50|$|Hatching {{success is}} 90% and the {{fledging}} survival rate is 70-90%. Average mortality is 70-80% {{in the first}} year and 40-70% for the adult. Although the record age is more than 11 years, most survive less than four years. Barn <b>swallow</b> nestlings have <b>prominent</b> red gapes, a feature shown to induce feeding by parent birds. An experiment in manipulating brood size and immune system showed the vividness of the gape was positively correlated with T-cell-mediated immunocompetence, and that larger brood size and injection with an antigen led to a less vivid gape.|$|R
40|$|Background: Communication and <b>swallowing</b> {{changes are}} <b>prominent</b> in Parkinson's disease, but {{there remains a}} lack of {{information}} regarding the experiences and expectations of people with Parkinson's disease in respect of speech-language therapy (SLT) services. Aims: To conduct a survey of people with Parkinson's disease and their carers in the United Kingdom to elicit their views concerning communication and swallowing changes in Parkinson's disease and the support they envisage in helping with these changes. Methods & Procedures: A national survey utilizing a questionnaire developed for the project, accessible by people with Parkinson's disease in web-based, e-mail or paper forms. Outcomes & Results: A total of 168 people with Parkinson's disease (median = 7 years since diagnosis, range = 0. 5 - 30) and 47 carers who provided their impression {{of the experience of}} the PwPD responded. Of these 215, 92 (43 %) had no contact with SLT services. In general those who had seen an SLT found it a positive experience. Pointers for improvement centred around timing, intensity, duration and access to SLT as well as issues around transfer and maintenance of gains outside of clinic and (lack of) attention to psychosocial dimensions. Availability of ongoing support as the situation evolved and access to SLT when it was needed were two prominent features desired of a responsive service. Conclusions & Implications: Responses suggest that when SLT is available it offers positive support, but respondents felt (re) access when and where SLT is needed could improve, as well as what aspects of swallowing and communication were addressed in assessment and therapy. We reflect on possible recommendations to address the challenges for SLT services in considering organization and content of provision...|$|R
