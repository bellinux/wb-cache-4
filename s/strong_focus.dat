5|$|In {{market and}} brand focused companies, design {{management}} focuses mainly on brand design management, including corporate brand management and product brand management. Focusing on the brand {{as the core}} for design decisions results in a <b>strong</b> <b>focus</b> on the brand experience, customer touch points, reliability, recognition, and trust relations. The design {{is driven by the}} brand vision and strategy.|$|E
5|$|It is {{important}} to note that the boundaries between category are able to be moved to allocate more or fewer clients to each category. It is normal to see fewer higher likelihood and/or consequence clients rather than 50% of the population or 50% of the assessed likelihood or consequence. In other words, the boundary is shifted so there can be a <b>strong</b> <b>focus</b> on the few assessed to be higher risk.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Strong</b> <b>focusing</b> {{was first}} {{conceived}} by Nicholas Christofilos in 1949 but not published (Christofilos opted instead to patent his idea), In 1952, the <b>strong</b> <b>focusing</b> principle was independently developed by Ernest Courant, M. Stanley Livingston, Hartland Snyder and J. Blewett at Brookhaven National Laboratory, [...] who later acknowledged {{the priority of}} Christofilos' idea. The advantages of <b>strong</b> <b>focusing</b> were then quickly realised, and deployed on the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron.|$|R

5|$|While Guitar Hero: Aerosmith {{maintains}} the same gameplay as past Guitar Hero games, {{it has received}} criticism for being shorter and easier than the previous Guitar Hero titles and difficult to justify its price point; furthermore, with the game's <b>strong</b> <b>focus</b> on one band, reviewers felt that the game's ultimate enjoyment rested on the player's appreciation and fandom for the music of Aerosmith.|$|E
5|$|In November 2011, the Würzburg local {{newspaper}} Main-Post published a 216-page book written by its sports journalists Jürgen Höpfl and Fabian Frühwirth: Einfach Er– Dirk Nowitzki– Aus Würzburg an die Weltspitze, (Just Him– Dirk Nowitzki– From Würzburg to {{top of the}} world). Both Höpfl and Frühwirth accompanied Nowitzki throughout his career, collecting interviews and photos used in the book. It looks back on the 2011 NBA Finals but also has a <b>strong</b> <b>focus</b> on Nowitzki's relation to his hometown Würzburg and his career progression beginning there. The book features insights from former coaches, family members, and friends.|$|E
5|$|Although the Robbins Report did {{not receive}} the same {{recognition}} as the Leopold Report, it reached similar conclusions. However, unlike the Leopold Report, the Robbins Report criticized the NPS for its lack of scientific research and made recommendations for sweeping changes {{in the structure of}} the NPS, with a proposal for a <b>strong</b> <b>focus</b> on a science-based approach. In 1972, the far more detailed Cain Report was released; amounting to 207 pages in comparison to the Leopold Report's scant 28, its committee was chaired by Stanley A. Cain, who also worked on the Leopold Report. Although this report made similar recommendations to the one primarily written by Leopold, it stated that little had been done to advance the previous report's findings, especially in terms of predator control. As a result of the Cain Report's recommendations, President Richard Nixon signed Executive Order 11643, which restricted the usage of poisons such as strychnine and sodium cyanide for predator control.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there were}} many other small {{pharmaceutical}} companies in the United States, Eli Lilly and Company distinguished itself from the others by having a permanent research staff, inventing superior techniques for the mass production of medicinal drugs, and its <b>strong</b> <b>focus</b> on quality. At first, Lilly was the company's only researcher, but as the business grew, he established a research laboratory and employed others who were dedicated to creating new drugs. Lilly hired his first full-time research chemist, Ernest G. Eberhards, and botanist, Walter H. Evans, in 1886. The department's methods of research were based on Lilly's. He insisted on quality assurance and instituted mechanisms {{to ensure that the}} drugs being produced would be effective and perform as advertised, had the correct combination of ingredients, and had the correct dosages of medicines in each pill. He was aware of the addictive and dangerous nature of some of his drugs, and pioneered the concept of giving such drugs only to people who had first seen a physician to determine if they needed the medicine.|$|E
5|$|On 30 January 1933, the Nazi Party, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Adolf Hitler, came to power and began to rearm Germany. The Heer (Germany Army) was increased and modernized with a <b>strong</b> <b>focus</b> on the Panzer (tank) force. Personnel were recruited from the cavalry. In October 1935 Panzer-Regiment 2 was created and was subordinated to the 1st Panzer Division, at the time under command of General Maximilian von Weichs. The soldiers of the I. Abteilung (1st Battalion) came from Saxony and Thuringia, the II. Abteilung (2nd Battalion) was made up from soldiers from Silesia. Strachwitz, who had served as an officer of the reserves in Reiter-Regiment 7 (7th Cavalry Regiment) in Breslau, had asked to be transferred to the Panzer force and, in May 1936, participated in his first manoeuvre on the training ground at Ohrdruf, followed by an exercise of live firing on the gunnery training ground at Putlos—today in the administrative district of Oldenburg-Land—near the Baltic Sea. A year later, from July to August 1937, he participated in a second reserve training exercise on the Silesian training grounds at Neuhammer—present-day Świętoszów.|$|E

50|$|Dipole magnets alone {{only provide}} {{what is called}} weak focusing, and a storage ring {{composed}} of only these sorts of magnetic elements results in the particles having a relatively large beam size. Interleaving dipole magnets with an appropriate arrangement of quadrupole and sextupole magnets can give a suitable <b>strong</b> <b>focusing</b> system that can give a much smaller beam size. The FODO and Chasman-Green lattice structures are simple examples of <b>strong</b> <b>focusing</b> systems, {{but there are many}} others.|$|R
