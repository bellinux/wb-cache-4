Toklas wrote of this re-meeting that Hunter was at first shocked by the style of artists such as Matisse, but obviously strongly impressed.|$|E

A delighted Tom teases Leslie {{the rest of the day}} by pretending they are a couple, but she finally silences him by kissing him.

25|$|In November 1988, Joanne's parents {{forced her}} to give up three-month-old Jeff {{to the care of}} his father, who lived with his parents and family in Red Lake. In June 1991, when Jeff was nearly three years old, his mother {{reclaimed}} the boy. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> to live in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area.

25|$|In {{the morning}} of May 20, Garfield, against his doctor's strict orders, played several strenuous sets of tennis with a friend, {{mentioning}} {{the fact that he}} had not been to bed the night before. He met actress Iris Whitney for dinner, and afterward became suddenly ill complaining that he felt chilled. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> to her apartment, where he refused to let her call a doctor and instead went to bed. The next morning, she found him dead. Long-term heart problems, allegedly aggravated by the stress of his blacklisting, had led to his death at the age of 39.|$|E
25|$|During his childhood, Bernstein {{performed}} professionally as {{a dancer}} and an actor, {{in the latter case}} playing the part of Caliban in The Tempest on Broadway, and he also won several prizes for his painting. He attended Manhattan's progressive Walden School and gravitated toward music at the age of twelve, at which time he was given a scholarship in piano by Henriette Michelson, a Juilliard teacher who guided him throughout his entire career as a pianist. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> to play some of his improvisations for composer Aaron Copland, who was encouraging and selected Israel Citkowitz as a teacher for the young boy. Bernstein's music has some stylistic similarities to Copland's music, most notably in his western scores, particularly sections of Big Jake, in the Gregory Peck film Amazing Grace and Chuck, and in his spirited score for the 1958 film adaptation of Erskine Caldwell's novel God's Little Acre.|$|E

25|$|He {{lived with}} his mother in Mecca for three years until <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> to Yathrib to visit some {{relatives}} (uncles from the mother side), and she died on the way back. Now orphaned, Muhammad, aged 6, was passed into the custody of his grandfather, Abd al-Muttalib, who was eighty years old. According to traditional accounts, Muhammad was very close to his grandfather, as had been his father before him. However, two years later, his grandfather died. Muhammad then came under the care of his uncle Abu Talib, the new leader of the Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe. In 6th-century Arabia, there was general disdain for guardians who took care of the weaker members of the tribes in Mecca. Although Muhammad's guardians saw that he did not starve to death, it was hard for them to do more for him, especially as the fortunes of the clan of Hashim seem to have been declining at that time.|$|E

2500|$|Renoir {{was largely}} raised by Gabrielle Renard, his nanny and his mother's cousin, {{with whom he}} {{developed}} a strong bond. Shortly before his birth, {{she had come to}} live with the Renoir family. She introduced the young boy to the Guignol puppet shows in Montmartre, which influenced his later film career. He wrote in his 1974 memoirs My Life and My Films, [...] "She taught me to see the face behind the mask and the fraud behind the flourishes. She taught me to detest the cliché." [...] Gabrielle was also fascinated by the new motion-picture invention, and when Renoir was only a few years old <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> to see his first film.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to Haley's drinking problems, it had also become {{obvious that he}} was having serious mental problems as well; Martha Maria said that, [...] "It was like sometimes he was drunk even when he wasn't drinking." [...] After he'd been jailed by the Harlingen Police, Martha had the judge put Haley in the hospital where he was seen by a psychiatrist who said Bill's brain was overproducing a chemical, like adrenaline. The doctor prescribed a medication to stop the overproduction but said Bill would have to stop drinking. Martha said, [...] "This is pointless." [...] <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> home, however, fed him and gave him his first dose. As soon as he felt better, he went back out to his room in the pool house and the downward spiral continued until his death on February 9, 1981.|$|E
2500|$|Beath was {{diagnosed}} with autism {{at the age of}} four in 1964, thanks to the persistence of his mother who knew he wasn't simply [...] "retarded" [...] (as it was expressed {{in the language of the}} day). <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> to see Dr Kenneth Soddy and followed his programme for autistic children which emphasised inclusive and stimulating activities with trusted family members such as singing, talking, reading aloud and imaginative play and a reduction in the time he was allowed to spend in solitary activities. Within eighteen months he was speaking and enjoying play with children he knew but remained shy and confused when confronted with children unknown to him or in a setting outside his home. As an adult, he became an advocate for those living with autism and frequently gave talks about his life and living with the syndrome. He was an active participant, supporter and speaker of Autonomy Shropshire (a self-help group based in Shropshire for young people and adults with high ability autism) and Autism Cymru. For several years, he was an advisor to the board on autism spectrum disorders for Autistica.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the further}} {{advice of the}} psychiatrist, the couple had planned another European vacation. At the last minute, Emerson feigned being unwell and insisted Loos {{continue}} alone. Arriving in London, she was promptly taken under the wing of socialite Sibyl Colefax, whose drawing room had become a salon filled with [...] "the bright young things" [...] of the day such as John Gielgud, Harold Nicolson, Noël Coward and notables such as Arnold Bennett, Max Beerbohm and Bernard Shaw. Photos of Loos on the social scene in London appeared in the New York papers, and Emerson's subsequent whisper-throated [...] "death bed" [...] phone calls managed to inflict guilt on Loos for her absence overseas. Emerson finally joined Loos in London, and to keep his spirits up <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> to the theater every night. It worked: at times he forgot to continue his act and spoke in normal tones. The couple continued on to Paris, where Loos renewed old friendships and made new ones. Emerson's recovery was remarkable. In September, their vacation was cut short; Loos was needed back in New York to do revisions on Blondes for its Broadway debut. Despite them, Blondes closed in April 1927.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{these few}} {{prolific}} plays, Damala was quickly forgotten or even deliberately {{ignored by the}} Parisian society, following his separation from the great diva. In March 1889, Bernhardt returned to Paris after a year-long European tour and receive a message from Damala who informed {{her that he was}} dying in Marseille and begged her to forgive him and take him back. The fact she had never stopped loving and caring for her husband was proved that very moment: she abandoned her performances in Paris, rushed to him and nursed Damala, whose health was wasted {{as a result of his}} longtime addiction. <b>She</b> <b>took</b> <b>him</b> in her house and after he recuperated, she cast him as her leading man in La Dame aux Camélias. Damala promised to stop taking morphine and embarked on a European tour with Bernhardt (which also included Egypt). In truth, Damala's addiction to drugs became progressively worse. He continued using the drug and occasionally ridiculed himself, his clarity severely reduced from the morphine. On one occasion, he almost got arrested for exhibiting himself naked in the Hotel de Ville in Milan. Damala reprised his role as Armand but after a six-week run he collapsed and was carried in the hospital. Shortly before his death, he was offered another role by Bernhardt, in the play Lena, at the Théâtre des Variêtés. [...] Just after the second performance, he was considered incapable of playing the part, due to his now permanent lack of clarity and continuous influence from alcohol and drugs.|$|E
