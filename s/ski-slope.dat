40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an application of}} the Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) and ensemble correlation for detection of the transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs), and high resolution time-frequency mapping. The HHT provides {{a powerful tool for}} nonlinear analysis of nonstationary signals such as TEOAEs. Since the HHT itself does not distinguish between signal and noise it was used with ensemble correlation to extract information about intervals with correlated activity. The combination of methods produced good results for both tasks TEOAE detection and time-frequency mapping. The resulting detection performance, using the mean hearing threshold as audiological separation criterion, was a specificity of 81 % at a sensitivity of 90 % to be compared to 65 % with the traditional wave reproducibility detection criterion. High resolution time frequency mapping predicted in more than 70 % of the cases hearing loss at a specific frequency in cases of <b>ski-sloping</b> audiograms. The present method does not require a priori information on the signal and may, with minor changes, be successfully applied to analysis of other types of repetitive signals such as evoked potentials...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{estimates}} hedonic price {{models for}} {{a sample of}} 610 vacation rental houses located {{in the vicinity of}} a lake and four-season ski-golf resort. Hedonic semilogarithmic regression models are estimated for peak summer and peak winter rentals for 2008. The regression estimates for weekly rental prices are conditioned on explanatory variables for house size, house quality, and locational features including lakefront proximity and <b>ski-slope</b> access. Subsample regressions are reported for properties managed by three real estate agencies and for a sample of vacation-rental-by-owner properties. The regression estimates are used to obtain percentage effects and monetary values for each explanatory variable. The estimates provide evidence that access to recreation opportunities is reflected importantly in rental offers. Evaluated at the sample means, lakefront locations have a rental premium of about $ 1200 per week (plus- 44 %) and the premium for <b>ski-slope</b> locations is $ 500 - 600 per week (plus- 23 to 27 %). In addition to structural characteristics, percentage and monetary values are reported for split-lakefronts, skiroad access, private docks, and private swimming pools. The paper also reports hedonic models corrected for spatial correlation. Although there is some evidence of positive spatial correlation in the OLS residuals, estimation by maximum likelihood does not result in substantial changes in most coefficient magnitudes or standard error estimates...|$|E

40|$|Background: Hearing loss {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{symptoms}} of mitochondrial disorders. However, audiological pheno-types associated with different molecular defects in mtDNA are not yet well characterized. Material/Methods: A large cohort of 1499 nonconsanguineous patients aged 5 – 40 years with hearing loss of unknown etiology was screened for mutations in mtDNA. For further analysis, patients harboring m. 1555 A>G and m. 3243 A>G were selected. Hearing status of the patients was assessed by pure tone audiometry. Patterns of audiograms (hearing thresh-old levels at each examined frequency) were statistically compared among the carriers of the m. 1555 A>G and the m. 3243 A>G mutations. Results: We identified 20 patients positive for m. 1555 A>G mutation and 16 patients positive for m. 3243 A>G change. The frequency of the above transitions was calculated in our cohort as 1. 33 % and 1. 06 %, respectively. Seventeen affected family members carrying the mutations were included into the study. Typical shape of the audiograms in patients with m. 1555 A>G mutation presented a <b>ski-slope</b> pattern, where-as the audiometric curves among the m. 3243 A>G individuals had a pantonal shape (a flat curve) with slight downward sloping at the higher frequencies.

40|$|The {{present study}} of KCNQ 4 {{mutations}} {{was carried out}} to 1) determine the prevalence by unbiased population-based genetic screening, 2) clarify the mutation spectrum and genotype/phenotype correlations, and 3) summarize clinical characteristics. In addition, {{a review of the}} reported mutations was performed for better understanding of this deafness gene. The screening using 287 probands from unbiased Japanese autosomal dominant nonsyndromic hearing loss (ADNSHL) families identified 19 families with 7 different disease causing mutations, indicating that the frequency is 6. 62 % (19 / 287). While the majority were private mutations, one particular recurrent mutation, c. 211 delC, was observed in 13 unrelated families. Haplotype analysis in the vicinity of c. 211 delC suggests existence of a common ancestor. The majority of the patients showed all frequency, but high-frequency predominant, sensorineural hearing loss. The present study adds a new typical audiogram configuration characterized by mid-frequency predominant hearing loss caused by the p. V 230 E mutation. A variant at the N-terminal site (c. 211 delC) showed typical <b>ski-slope</b> type audiogram configuration. Concerning clinical features, onset age was from 3 to 40 years old, and mostly in the teens, and hearing loss was gradually progressive. Progressive nature is a common feature of patients with KCNQ 4 mutations regardless of the mutation type.

40|$|The RetroX {{is a new}} semi-implantable {{hearing aid}} which does not occlude the {{external}} ear canal. It consists of an electronic unit that plugs into a titanium tube which is implanted under the pinna so as to connect the retroauricular sulcus with the inside lumen of the external ear canal. Implantation requires minor surgery which can be performed under local anesthesia. Moreover, a pre-implant simulator exists and allows patients to try the device before deciding on definite implantation. The RetroX auditory implant is indicated in case of high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss with a steep slope (<b>ski-slope</b> audiogram). We implanted 25 adults suffering from such a hearing loss, and we report their hearing measured after 2. 5 to 15 months of use. Four patients developed a persistent granulomatous reaction which disappeared after explantation. Two patients complained of acoustic feedback and needed supplementary fitting. Twenty three of our 25 subjects are satisfied or even extremely satisfied with the hearing improvement provided by the RetroX; they wear the implant daily, from morning until evening. Audiometrically, we observed a statistically significant improvement of the pure-tone thresholds at 1, 2, 4 and 8 kHz. In quiet, the speech reception thresholds decreased by 10 dB SPL and in noise, speech intelligibility increased by 15 % for signal-to-noise ratios between - 5 dB and + 5 dB. Up till now, our patients were implanted monaurally because of financial considerations and our initial inexperience with this new implant. The overall results, however, are promising and nowadays, we advise bilateral implantation for patients who tolerate the first implant.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze the subjective satisfaction and measure the hearing gain provided by the RetroX (Auric GmbH, Rheine, Germany), an auditory implant of the external ear. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective case review. SETTING: We conducted this study at a tertiary referral center at a university hospital. SUBJECTS: We studied 10 adults with high-frequency sensori-neural hearing loss (<b>ski-slope</b> audiogram). INTERVENTION: The RetroX consists of an electronic unit sited in the postaural sulcus connected to a titanium tube implanted under the auricle between the sulcus and the entrance of the external auditory canal. Implanting requires only minor surgery under local anesthesia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Main outcome measures were a satisfaction questionnaire, pure-tone audiometry in quiet, speech audiometry in quiet, speech audiometry in noise, and azimuth audiometry (hearing threshold in function of sound source location within the horizontal plane at ear level). RESULTS:: Subjectively, all 10 patients are satisfied or even extremely satisfied with the hearing improvement provided by the RetroX. They wear the implant daily, from morning to evening. We observe a statistically significant improvement of pure-tone thresholds at 1, 2, and 4 kHz. In quiet, the speech reception threshold improves by 9 dB. Speech audiometry in noise shows that intelligibility improves by 26 % for a signal-to-noise ratio of - 5 dB, by 18 % for a signal-to-noise ratio of 0 dB, and by 13 % for a signal-to-noise ratio of + 5 dB. Localization audiometry indicates that the skull masks sound contralateral to the implanted ear. Of the 10 patients, one had acoustic feedback and one presented with a granulomatous reaction to the foreign body that necessitated removing the implant. CONCLUSION: The RetroX auditory implant is a semi-implantable hearing aid without occlusion of the external auditory canal. It provides a new therapeutic alternative for managing high-frequency hearing loss...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, genotype-phenotype {{correlations}} in eight Dutch DFNB 8 / 10 families with compound heterozygous mutations in TMPRSS 3 were addressed. We compared the phenotypes {{of the families}} {{by focusing on the}} mutation data. The compound heterozygous variants in the TMPRSS 3 gene in the present families included one novel variant, p. Val 199 Met, and four previously described pathogenic variants, p. Ala 306 Thr, p. Thr 70 fs, p. Ala 138 Glu, and p. Cys 107 Xfs. In addition, the p. Ala 426 Thr variant, which had previously been reported as a possible polymorphism, was found in one family. All affected family members reported progressive bilateral hearing impairment, with variable onset ages and progression rates. In general, the hearing impairment affected the high frequencies first, and sooner or later, depending on the mutation, the low frequencies started to deteriorate, which eventually resulted in a flat audiogram configuration. The <b>ski-slope</b> audiogram configuration is suggestive for the involvement of TMPRSS 3. Our data suggest that not only the protein truncating mutation p. T 70 fs has a severe effect but also the amino acid substitutions p. Ala 306 Thr and p. Val 199 Met. A combination of two of these three mutations causes prelingual profound hearing impairment. However, in combination with the p. Ala 426 Thr or p. Ala 138 Glu mutations, a milder phenotype with postlingual onset of the hearing impairment is seen. Therefore, the latter mutations are likely to be less detrimental for protein function. Further studies are needed to distinguish possible phenotypic differences between different TMPRSS 3 mutations. Evaluation of performance of patients with a cochlear implant indicated that this is a good treatment option for patients with TMPRSS 3 mutations as satisfactory speech reception was reached after implantation...|$|E

40|$|High-alpine {{areas are}} subject to rapid {{topographic}} changes, mainly caused by natural processes like glacial retreat and other geomorphological processes, and also due to anthropogenic interventions like construction of slopes and infrastructure in skiing resorts. Consequently, the demand for highly accurate digital terrain models (DTMs) in alpine environments has arisen. Public administrations often have dedicated resources for the regular monitoring of glaciers and natural hazard processes. In case of glaciers, traditional monitoring encompasses in-situ measurements of area and length and the estimation of volume and mass changes. Next to field measurements, data for such monitoring programs {{can be derived from}} DTMs and digital ortho photos (DOPs). Skiing resorts, on the other hand, require DTMs as input for planning and – more recently – for RTK-GNSS supported <b>ski-slope</b> grooming. Although different in scope, the demand of both user groups is similar: high-quality and up-to-date terrain data for extended areas often characterised by difficult accessibility and large elevation ranges. Over the last two decades, airborne laser scanning (ALS) has replaced photogrammetric approaches as state-of-the-art technology for the acquisition of high-resolution DTMs also in alpine environments. Reasons include the higher productivity compared to (manual) stereo-photogrammetric measurements, canopy-penetration capability, and limitations of photo measurements on sparsely textured surfaces like snow or ice. Nevertheless, the last few years have shown strong technological advances in the field of aerial camera technology, image processing and photogrammetric software which led to new possibilities for image-based DTM generation even in alpine terrain. At Vermessung AVT, an Austrian-based surveying company, and its subsidiary Terra Messflug, very promising results have been achieved for various projects in high-alpine environments, using images acquired by large-format digital cameras of Microsoft’s UltraCam series and the in-house processing chain centred on the Dense-Image-Matching (DIM) software SURE by nFrames. This paper reports the work carried out at AVT for the surface- and terrain modelling of several high-alpine areas using DIM- and ALS-based approaches. A special focus is dedicated to the influence of terrain morphology, flight planning, GNSS/IMU measurements, and ground-control distribution in the georeferencing process on the data quality. Based on the very promising results, some general recommendations for aerial photogrammetry processing in high-alpine areas are made to achieve best possible accuracy of the final 3 D-, 2. 5 D- and 2 D products...|$|E
