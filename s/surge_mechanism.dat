40|$|The 'convection surge' {{model for}} ion acceleration, {{designed}} by Mauk (1986) {{to explain the}} observed ion distributions and the field-aligned character of middle magnetospheric ion distributions during the expansion phase of a substorm, was extended to include the self-consistent generation of magnetic-field-aligned electric fields. Results from the modified model show that the convection <b>surge</b> <b>mechanism</b> leads to the generation of dynamical macroscopic magnetic field-aligned electric fields that begin their strongest developments very near the magnetic equator and then propagate to higher latitudes. Potential drops as high as 1 to 10 kV might be expected, depending on the mass species of the ions and on the electron temperatures.

Controls on the global distribution of surge-type glaciers hold the keys {{to a better understanding of}} <b>surge</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> We investigate correlations between the distribution of surge-type glaciers and climatic and glacier geometry variables, using a new global geodatabase of 2317 surge-type glaciers. The highest densities of surge-type glaciers occur within an optimal climatic envelope bounded by temperature and precipitation thresholds. Across all regions with both surge-type and normal glaciers, the former are larger, especially at the cold, dry end of the climatic spectrum. A species distribution model, Maxent, accurately predicts the major clusters of surge-type glaciers using a series of climatic and glacier geometry variables, but under-predicts clusters found outside the climatically optimal surge zone. We interpret the results in terms of a new enthalpy cycle model. Steady states require a balance between enthalpy gains generated by the balance flux and losses via heat conduction and meltwater discharge. This condition can be most easily satisfied in cold, dry environments (thin, low-flux glaciers, efficient conductive heat losses) and warm, humid environments (high meltwater discharges). Intermediate conditions correspond to the optimal surge zone, where neither heat conduction nor runoff can effectively discharge enthalpy gains, and dynamic cycling can result.

Because prepubertal ovarian production of E differs quantitatively and qualitatively from chronic E replacement, {{we tested the}} hypothesis that postnatal E exacerbates the consequences of prenatal T on the positive, but not the negative, steroid feedback controls of GnRH secretion. Our approach was to characterize prepubertal sensitivity to E negative feedback, the onset and maintenance of progestagenic cycles, and the LH surge response in ovary intact, prenatally untreated (control), and T-treated (T) sheep that were exposed postnatally to only endogenous E, or exposed to excess E by sc implant. Sensitivity to E negative feedback was reduced in T females, but excess postnatal E did not further increase LH pulse frequency. Excess E prevented ovarian cycles in several control females, and increased cycle irregularity in T females. However, the LH <b>surge</b> <b>mechanism</b> was functional in all control females (regardless of postnatal E exposure) and in some T females without excess E, but nonfunctional in T females with excess E. These findings suggest that postnatal E does not program increased resistance to E negative feedback, but excess postnatal E does disrupt other mechanisms required for ovarian cyclicity. We conclude that in this precocial species, prenatal steroids are sufficient to program controls of tonic LH secretion, but the LH <b>surge</b> <b>mechanism</b> is susceptible to further programming by postnatal E...|$|E

These were constructed from 778 magnitudes {{taken with the}} 1. 3 -m telescope on Cerro Tololo as operated by a service observer for the SMARTS consortium. Over our typical phase range of 0. 2 - 10 deg, we find our phase curves to be adequately described by a linear model, for slopes of 0. 04 - 0. 09 mag/deg with average uncertainty less than 0. 02 mag/deg. (The one exception, 51378 (2001 AT 33), has a formally negative slope of - 0. 02 +- 0. 01 mag/deg.) These slopes are too steep for the opposition <b>surge</b> <b>mechanism</b> to be shadow hiding (SH), so we conclude that the dominant <b>surge</b> <b>mechanism</b> must be coherent backscattering (CB). In a detailed comparison of surface properties (including surge slope, B-R color, and albedo), {{we find that the}} Trojans have surface properties similar to the P and C class asteroids prominent in the outer main belt, yet they have significantly different surge properties (at a confidence level of 99. 90 %). This provides an imperfect argument against the traditional idea that the Trojans were formed around Jupiter's orbit. We also find no overlap in Trojan properties with either the main belt asteroids or with the small icy bodies in the outer Solar System. Importantly, we find that the Trojans are indistinguishable from other small bodies in the outer Solar System that have lost their surface ices (such as the gray Centaurs, gray Scattered Disk Objects, and dead comets). Thus, we find strong support for the idea that the Trojans originally formed as icy bodies in the outer Solar System, were captured into their current orbits during the migration of the gas giant planets, and subsequently lost all their surface ices.

40|$|To {{explore the}} {{properties}} of the 'convection surge' mechanism postulated by Quinn and Southwood (1982), a quantitative computer model of the mechanism is constructed. The model incorporates the dipolarization of the field line shapes as well as the results of recent transient electric field measurements by the AST- 6 satellite. The computer model numerically integrates the equations of motion of ensembles of ions populating a single flux tube that goes through the convection surge or 'dipolarization' transformation. The numerical results confirm that the mechanism easily generates the bounce-phase-bunched ion distributions in question, and show that the convection surge can generate dramatically field-aligned ion distributions.

The NYT sequence can be subdivided in a lower and an upper member. Sedimentological and textural variations in time and space indicate that different eruptive and depositional mechanisms operated during the eruption. The lower member eruptive phase was characterized by alternating phreatoplinian and magmatic explosions while the upper member eruptive phase was characterized by a random sequence of phreatomagmatic and magmatic explosions. Particles produced by the same explosion were deposited contemporaneously by fallout and <b>surge</b> <b>mechanisms</b> either at different or at the same distance from the vent.

Each phreatoplinian explosion tapped concurrently all the magma layers while magmatic explosions tapped only one of them.

40|$|IN MAMMALS, OVULATION is {{triggered}} by a dramatic rise in circulating levels of LH, whose secretion is induced by GnRH. The preovulatory GnRH/LH <b>surge</b> <b>mechanism</b> is sexually differentiated and occurs only in females (1 – 3). The ability of females, but not males, to produce a GnRH/LH surge presumably reflects sexual differentiation of neural circuits in the forebrain, and this differentiation process is organized by gonadal steroids during the neonatal critical period (4 – 7). In the male, exposure to testosterone (T) or its metabolites during early postnatal life permanently alters the circuitry in the developing forebrain (8), averting its ability as an adult to generate a GnRH/LH surge in response to estradiol (E) (8). Because the brain of the female is normally unexposed to T during the neonatal period, it retains (or develops) the circuitry necessary to generate a GnRH/LH surge (2, 3). Males that are castrated during the neonatal critical period can produce a GnRH/LH surge as adults, just like normal females (3, 6); likewise, females that are exposed to T during the critical period lose their abilit...|$|E
40|$|Industry {{has lately}} turned {{the focus on}} subsea {{processing}} {{as a tool to}} enable new developments where the technology needs are increasing. Multiphase pumping (boosting) {{plays a key role in}} the increase of production and in oil and gas recovery. In addition, the technology has shown to be more profitable and environmental friendly compared to conventional methods, due to longer tie-back distances and the potential of zero gas flaring. However, the presence of gas leads to unwanted flow regimes generating additional performance losses and system instabilities. Safe and reliable operation requires a deep understanding of the physical mechanisms causing the unstable behavior. The main objective of the thesis has been to explore the multiphase booster instability and <b>surging</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to give an improved insight of the main influencing flow mechanisms. A literature study has been performed, reviewing previous studies considering surging in multiphase pumps. In addition, phase slip and other related mechanisms have been studied through bubble tracking and available correlations. Data processing and direct flow visualization with a high-speed camera have been employed in experimental tests. Additionally, a data processing system have been utilized in order to relate pressure pulsations to flow mechanisms. An extensive test campaign has been conducted through the test facility in the Thermal Energy Department Laboratory at NTNU. The facility features a mixed-flow rotodynamic single-stage multiphase pump, reproducing the full scale, MultiBooster, by Aker Solutions at Tranby (Oslo). The transparent pump casing permits an excellent optical access of the hydraulic channels, which allows a visual study of the flow field behavior. All tests have been performed at atmospheric inlet pressure, where gas volume fractions, flow rates, and rotational speeds are the varying parameters. Characteristic multiphase flow phenomena have been analyzed through flow visualization, bubble tracking, and data processing. The phenomena have shown to affect the machine negatively, due to the increased pressure variations and channel obstructions. The experimental work indicates that, bubble coalescence, gas pockets, phase slip, empty-of-gas channels, and recirculation zones plays a major role during the unsteady machine operation. The phenomena show an intermittent behavior, dependent on the operating condition and the specific pump design. As the surging is approached, the overall flow field irregularities show to intensify, accompanied with strong pressure variations. Moreover, this correlation has formed a foundation for detecting the surging inception, and will be presented in this thesis...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{operational}} problems of centrifugal compressors is the occurrence of surge. This flow instability degrades {{the performance of the}} compressor and limits its stable operating range. The most common <b>surge</b> protection <b>mechanism</b> is flow recycling. A recycling valve opens if the operating point of the machine gets close to a predicted surge point to prevent further reduction in flow. This causes a considerable waste and energy, specifically, when the valve has to respond to sudden changes in the flow which usually results in a great deal of overshooting in the recycled flow. This research presents a new method for active surge control in centrifugal compressors with unshrouded impellers using a magnetic thrust bearing to modulate the impeller tip clearance. Magnetic bearings offer the potential for active control of flow instabilities. This capability is highly dependent on the sensitivity of the compressor characteristics to blade tip clearance. If the position of the shaft can be actuated with sufficient authority and speed, the induced pressure modulation makes control of surge promising. The active nature of the magnetic bearing system makes the real–time static and dynamic positioning of the rotor and therefore modulation of the impeller tip clearance possible...|$|R

A two-stage, semi-continuous photobioreactor cultivation process was developed to induce the production of lipid-rich algal biomass from the centric diatom Cyclotella sp. In Stage I of the process, algal cells were grown up to high density until all of the dissolved silicon in the feed medium was consumed.

40|$|A {{large part}} of the ice flux within ice caps occurs through {{spatially}} limited fast-flowing units. Some of them permanently maintain fast flow, whereas others operate in an oscillatory mode, characterized by short-lived active phases followed by long quiescent phases. This surge-type behaviour results from intrinsic rather than external factors, thus complicating estimates of glacier response to climate change. Here we present numerical model results from Austfonna, an ice cap on Svalbard that comprises several surge-type basins. Previous studies have suggested a thermally controlled soft-bed <b>surge</b> <b>mechanism</b> for Svalbard. We systematically change the parameters that govern the nature of basal motion and thereby control the transition between permanent and oscillatory fast flow. Surge-type behaviour is realized by a relatively abrupt onset of basal sliding when basal temperatures approach the pressure-melting point and enhanced sliding of marine grounded ice. Irrespective of the dynamic regime, the absence of considerable volumes of temperate ice, both in the observed and simulated ice cap, indicates that fast flow is accomplished by basal motion over a temperate bed. Given an idealized present-day climate, the equilibrium ice-cap size varies significantly, depending on the chosen parameters...|$|E

40|$|Surge-type glaciers {{repeatedly}} oscillate {{between a}} short active phase characterized by order-of-magnitude speed-up {{and a long}} quiescent phase. During the active phase, a significantlylarge volume of ice is transporteddownstream, causing surface elevation changes and terminus advance, as well as forming heavily-damaged crevasses and looped moraines. On the other hands, in the quiescent phase, they flows lowly or become stagnant in the downstream area, leading to ice thickeningin the reservoir area. The imbalanced flow results in retreat and thinning in the receiving area. Surge-type glaciers are distributed in specific areas, and one of highly concentrated zones is near the border of Alaska and Yukon, Canada. In this area, glacier surge often initiates in winter, but the triggering mechanism remains unclear. An extensive ground-based observation on the 1982 - 83 Variegated Glacier’s surge has brought a fundamental idea of <b>surge</b> generation <b>mechanism.</b> However, there remainsa question as to how basal water pressure increase and subsequent speed-up can be maintained without further input of meltwater from the surface. Moreover, it remains uncertain what controls the surge cycle, and generates the pre-condition before surging. To answer these questions, we used multi-satellite images to reveal dynamics of surge-type glaciers in Yukon, Canada. The detailed spatial and temporal changes in ice speed cantell us new insight into behaviors of surge-type glaciers during both quiescent and active phases. Surface elevation change data can show the place where surge initiates and how the surge front propagates downstream.

40|$|Terrestrial glacial {{geomorphology}} {{has long}} been {{used to evaluate the}} extent, chronology and dynamics of former glaciers and ice sheets. New marine geophysical methods provide an opportunity to study the glacial submarine morphology of modern continental shelves and fjord systems. This makes it possible to study landform assemblages in the submarine settings that are often better preserved than their terrestrial counterparts. This study focuses mainly on the recent surge history of the tidewater glacier Tunabreen, which calves into Tempelfjorden in Western Spitsbergen. Tunabreen is a small outlet glacier of the Lomonosovfonna ice cap and has experienced severalsurges and terminal retreats during the last century. The multiple surge events havemost likely removed or reworked landform assemblages created by earlier surges,resulting in a complex geomorphological imprint on the bed of Tempelfjorden. Tunabreen has left a specific morphological imprint on the sea floor, consisting of iceflow‐parallel lineations and generally flow‐transverse retreat moraines. Comparisonof retreat moraines mapped from high resolution multibeam bathymetric data andglacier terminal positions, established using remote sensing imagery suggest that themoraines in the inner part of Tempelfjorden are annually formed recessionalmoraines, formed during winter still stands of the glacier margin or during its minorreadvances. Although detailed reconstruction of glacier surge dynamics based solelyon the landform distribution is challenging, it is evident that Tunabreen hasexperienced fast flow during surges and semiannual retreat of the margin after thesurges. The main achievements of this study are a spatial reconstruction of the dynamics ofTunabreen, which has experienced three surges during the last hundred years. Together with the Little Ice Age surge of the adjacent von Postbreen, four recentsurges have been recorded in Tempelfjorden since 1870, which distinguishes thestudy area from earlier studied Svalbard tidewater surge glacier settigs, where theglaciers have been known to surge only once or twice.

Here we identify eight recent surges in the region and map their surface velocities using cross-correlation feature tracking on optical satellite imagery. In total, we present 44 surface velocity data sets, which show that Karakoram surges are generally short-lived, lasting between 3 and 5 ?years in most cases, and have rapid buildup and relaxation phases, often lasting less than a year. Peak velocities of up to 2 ?km?a? 1 are reached during summer months, and the surges tend to diminish during winter months. Otherwise, they do not follow a clearly identifiable pattern. In two of the surges, the peak velocity travels down-ice through time as a wave, which we interpret as a surge front. Three other surges are characterized by high velocities that occur simultaneously across the entire glacier surface, and acceleration and deceleration are close to monotonic. There is also no consistent seasonal control on surge initiation or termination. We suggest that the differing styles of surge can be partly accounted for by individual glacier configurations and that while some characteristics of Karakoram surges are akin to thermally controlled surges elsewhere (e. g., Svalbard), the dominant <b>surge</b> <b>mechanism</b> remains unclear.

The central mystery of Nereid is now to explain the physical mechanism of these unique brightness changes and why they change with time. To characterize Nereid's variability, we have been using the SMARTS telescopes on Cerro Tololo for synoptic monitoring from 1999 to 2006. We present a well-sampled photometric time series of 493 magnitudes on 246 nights mostly in the V-band. In combination with our earlier data (for 774 magnitudes over 362 nights), our 20 -year data set is the most comprehensive for any small icy body in our Solar System. Our yearly light curves show that Nereid displays various types of behaviors: large amplitude brightenings and fadings (1987 to 1990); moderate-amplitude variation about the average phase curve (1993 - 1997, 2003, 2005), moderate-amplitude variation and systematically brighter by roughly one-quarter magnitude throughout the entire season (2004); and nearly constant light curves superimposed on a surprisingly large-amplitude opposition surge (1998, 1999, 2000, 2006). Other than in 2004, Nereid's variations were closely centered around a constant phase curve that is well fit with a Hapke model for the coherent backscattering opposition <b>surge</b> <b>mechanism</b> with angular scale of 0. 7 +- 0. 1 degrees. In our entire data set from 1987 - 2006, we find no significant periodicity.

TICE is {{the net effect of}} cholesterol excretion by the enterocyte into the intestinal lumen and is the balance between input and output fluxes through the enterocytes. These fluxes are: cholesterol excretion into the intestinal lumen mainly via ATP-binding cassette (ABC) G 5 / 8, cholesterol absorption from the intestine by Niemann-Pick C 1 like protein 1, the uptake of plasma lipoproteins by enterocytes at the basolateral membrane, and the excretion of cholesterol in chylomicrons into the lymph. Multiple studies have shown that TICE contributes to fecal neutral sterol (FNS) excretion in humans. TICE can be targeted with plant sterols, liver X receptor agonists, bile acids, ezetimibe, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors. TICE contributes significantly to FNS excretion in humans, independently of the biliary pathway.

40|$|A {{turbidity}} current that contains fresher or otherwise less dense water than its surroundings may initially be denser than the ambient and propagate as a bottom-hugging flow, but later reverse in buoyancy as its bulk density decreases through sedimentation to become {{lower than that}} of the ambient seawater. It is proposed that this reversal in buoyancy may be a significant mechanism controlling the structure and facies of turbiditic deposits. Buoyancy reversal followed by lofting may directly affect the relative distribution of fine and coarse material in the deposit, while buoyancy reversal itself may mediate the transformation between dilute and highly-concentrated suspension flows, particularly in distal regions, and thus lead to the formation of complex turbiditic beds: in particular, the generation of distal co-genetic debrites may be expected. Similar transformations occur within dilute pyroclastic density currents, where a mobile, basal concentrated flow, termed a surge-derived pyroclastic flow, develops through rapid sedimentation from the suspended load of the overlying <b>surge.</b> The physical <b>mechanisms</b> involved in these processes are discussed, leading to the proposal of some associated facies models; these are compared with field data from the Northern Apennines, with some striking similarities being noted as well as some differences. On the basis of this discussion, some directions are suggested for future experimental and modelling work on the topic...|$|R
40|$|Here {{we report}} on a cyclic, {{physical}} ice-discharge instability in the Parallel Ice Sheet Model, simulating the flow of a three-dimensional, inherently buttressed ice-sheet-shelf system which periodically surges on a millennial timescale. The thermomechanically coupled model on 1 km horizontal resolution includes an enthalpy-based formulation of the thermodynamics, a nonlinear stress-balance-based sliding law and a very simple subglacial hydrology. The simulated unforced surging is characterized by rapid ice streaming through a bed trough, resulting in abrupt discharge of ice across the grounding line which is eventually calved into the ocean. We visualize the central feedbacks that dominate the subsequent phases of ice buildup, surge and stabilization which emerge from the interaction between ice dynamics, thermodynamics and the subglacial till layer. Results from the variation of surface mass balance and basal roughness suggest that ice sheets of medium thickness may be more susceptible to surging than relatively thin or thick ones for which the surge feedback loop is damped. We also investigate the influence of different basal sliding laws (ranging from purely plastic to nonlinear to linear) on possible <b>surging.</b> The presented <b>mechanisms</b> underlying our simulations of self-maintained, periodic ice growth and destabilization {{may play a role}} in large-scale ice-sheet surging, such as the surging of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, which is associated with Heinrich events, and ice-stream shutdown and reactivation, such as observed in the Siple Coast region of West Antarctica...|$|R
40|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that the kisspeptin neurons of the hypothalamus {{play a key role}} in regulating the activity of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons. The population of kisspeptin neurons residing in the rostral periventricular region of the third ventricle (RP 3 V), encompassing the anteroventral periventricular (AVPV) and periventricular preoptic nuclei (PVpo), are implicated in the generation of the preovulatory GnRH <b>surge</b> <b>mechanism</b> and puberty onset in female rodents. The present study examined whether these kisspeptin neurons may express other neuropeptides in the adult female mouse. Initially, the distribution of galanin, neurotensin, met-enkephalin (mENK), and cholecystokinin (CCK) -immunoreactive cells was determined within the RP 3 V of colchicine-treated mice. Subsequent experiments, using a new kisspeptin- 10 antibody raised in sheep, examined the relationship of these neuropeptides to kisspeptin neurons. No evidence was found for expression of neurotensin or CCK by RP 3 V kisspeptin neurons, but subpopulations of kisspeptin neurons were observed to express galanin and mENK. Dual-labeled RP 3 V kisspeptin/galanin cells represented 7 % of all kisspeptin and 21 % of all galanin neurons whereas dual-labeled kisspeptin/mENK cells represented 28 – 38 % of kisspeptin neurons and 58 – 68 % of the mENK population, depending on location within the AVPV or PVpo. Kisspeptin neurons in the arcuate nucleus were also found to express galanin but not mENK. These observations indicate that, like the kisspeptin population of the arcuate nucleus, kisspeptin neurons in the RP 3 V also co-express a range of neuropeptides. This pattern of co-expression should greatly increase the dynamic range with which kisspeptin neurons can modulate the activity of their afferent neurons...|$|E
40|$|The {{necessity}} of brain aromatization for sexual differentiation was investigated by treating pregnant guinea pigs with an aromatase inhibitor, 1, 4, 6 -androstatriene- 3, 17 -dione (ATD), from Day 30 to Day 55 of gestation. In postnatal Week 16, subjects were gonadectomized, and blood {{samples were collected}} after treatment with 10 Rg estradiol benzoate (EB), used to elicit an LH surge; subjects were subsequently treated with GnRH to test pituitary responsiveness. Plasma samples were assayed for LH by RIA. Prenatal ATD treatment {{did not affect the}} organization of the LH <b>surge</b> <b>mechanism</b> in either male or female subjects. All animals, regardless of sex or treatment, released LH after GnRH treatment, but the responsiveness of the gonadotroph to GnRH was attenuated in both males and females treated with ATD in utero. In addition, a significant sex difference in the pattern of LH released in response to a GnRH challenge was found. ATD-treated animals did not respond to the negative feedback actions of EB on LH secretion (p < 0. 05), and the percentage of males displaying lordosis behavior was greater in this group than in controls (p < 0. 05). Mounting behavior and lordosis behavior of females were not significantly affected by treatment. These data demonstrate a need for estrogen in the organization of brain areas that mediate negative feedback control of LH in both sexes and lordosis behavior in the male guinea pig. The organization of positive feedback mechanisms for controlling LH seems to be under androgenic control. Our data also suggest that the responsiveness of the gonadotroph to GnRH action is develop-mentally coordinated by prenatal estrogen and is sexually differentiated...|$|E
40|$|The preovulatory GnRH/LH surge {{depends on}} the {{presence}} of estradiol (E 2) and is gated by a circadian oscillator in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) that causes the surge to occur within a specific temporal window. Although the mechanisms by which the clock times the LH surge are unclear, evidence suggests that the SCN is linked to GnRH neurons through a multisynaptic pathway that includes neurons in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV). Recently, Kiss 1 neurons in the AVPV have been implicated in the <b>surge</b> <b>mechanism,</b> suggesting that they may integrate circadian and E 2 signals to generate the LH surge. We tested whether Kiss 1 neurons display circadian patterns of regulation in synchrony with the temporal pattern of LH secretion. Mice housed in 14 h light, 10 h dark were ovariectomized, given E 2 capsules (or nothing), and transferred into constant darkness. Two days later, the mice were killed at various times of day and their LH and Kiss 1 levels assessed. In E 2 -treated females, LH levels were low except during late subjective day (indicative of an LH surge). Similarly, AVPV Kiss 1 expression and c-fos coexpression in Kiss 1 neurons showed circadian patterns that peaked coincident with LH. These temporal changes in Kiss 1 neurons occurred under steady-state E 2 and constant environmental conditions, suggesting that Kiss 1 neurons are regulated by circadian signals. In the absence of E 2, animals displayed no circadian pattern in LH secretion or Kiss 1 expression. Collectively, these findings suggest that the LH surge is controlled by AVPV Kiss 1 neurons whose activity is gated by SCN signals in an E 2 -dependent manner...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} the effects of exposure to short-term constant light (LL) on the spontaneous, proestrous luteinizing hormone (LH) surge in the female rat. Exposure to LL during the 3 days preceding proestrus delayed and reduced {{the magnitude of the}} LH surge which was measured in blood samples taken from conscious animals through an intra-atrial catheter that had been implanted early on the morning of proestrus. The pituitary responsiveness to synthetic luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) in animals exposed to LL was reduced about 6 -fold about the time of the LH surge compared with that in animals on a 14 h light- 10 h dark (LD) regimen. In contrast to animals on LD, treatment of rats on LL with estrogen and progesterone after ovariectomy failed to restore to normal the pituitary responsiveness which is markedly reduced by ovariectomy. The implantation of a silicone-elastomer capsule containing 17 beta-estradiol into rats on LL after ovariectomy did not facilitate pituitary responsiveness. These results suggest that exposure of the female rats to LL for 3 days causes a shift in phase of the LH surge (which may represent a free-running LH rhythm) and reduces the magnitude of the LH <b>surge</b> by a <b>mechanism</b> which may involve a reduction in the sensitivity to estrogen of the centres involved in LHRH release...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Large-scale bandwidth-based {{distributed}} denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks {{can quickly}} knock out substantial {{parts of a}} network before reactive defenses can respond. Even traffic flows that are not under direct attack can suffer significant collateral damage if these flows pass through links that are common to attack routes. Given the existence today of large botnets {{with more than a}} hundred thousand bots, the potential for a large-scale coordinated attack exists, especially given the prevalence of high-speed Internet access. This paper presents a Proactive <b>Surge</b> Protection (PSP) <b>mechanism</b> that aims to provide a broad first line of defense against DDoS attacks. The approach aims to minimize collateral damage by providing bandwidth isolation between traffic flows. This isolation is achieved through a combination of traffic measurements, bandwidth allocation of network resources, metering and tagging of packets at the network perimeter, and preferential dropping of packets inside the network. The proposed solution is readily deployable using existing router mechanisms and does not rely on any unauthenticated packet header information. Thus the approach is resilient to evading attack schemes that launch many seemingly legitimate TCP connections with spoofed IP addresses and port numbers. Finally, our extensive evaluation results across two large commercial backbone networks, using both distributed and targeted attack scenarios, show that up to 95. 5 % of the network could suffer collateral damage without protection, but our solution was able to significantly reduce the amount of collateral damage by up to 97. 58 % {{in terms of the number}} of packets dropped and 90. 36 % in terms of the number of flows with packet loss. Furthermore, we show that PSP can maintain low packet loss rates even when the intensity of attacks is increased significantly. I...|$|R
40|$|A {{misunderstanding}} of the failure mechanism of tantalum capacitors has created the fear of using these capacitors in high current applications. A capacitor depends on the dielectric as an insulative material and the plates as a conductive material. If the current was the trigger mechanism for failure, then the plates should be suspect throughout {{the life of the}} capacitor. This is not the case as the failures with this capacitor are normally related to initial power-on occurrences. As such, the failure mechanism is most likely the breakdown of the dielectric when exposed to a specific critical strain for the first time. The high available current ensures that the failure does not heal itself, but breaks down the dielectric so catastrophically that the dielectric loses most of its insulative properties. This Surge Step Stress Test (SSST) is intended to identify the critical stress level of any batch of capacitors to give some predictability to the power-on failure <b>mechanism.</b> <b>Surge</b> Current Failure Reputation Tantalum capacitors have a reputation whereby a great deal of concern is focused on the inrush current magnitude. We have been repeatedly exposed to catastrophic failures in circuits where the current is unlimited and the device fails short and then continues to generate extreme heat as current continues into the fault. The exposure to this failure has led us to recommend that the device have some series resistance as a current limiting function, eliminating almost all of these types of experiences. We associate the failure with high current and we define the fault development as related to current; but we have only identified a secondary characteristic of these failures. The test that was used to support this theory consisted of power-on voltage applications to samples of capacitors using various resistor values to limit the peak current. Because the higher values of series resistance created fewer failures, the conclusion was that the magnitude of the current created the differentiating point of failures...|$|R
