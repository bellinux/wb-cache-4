5000|$|Pullazhi/Pullazhy (പുല്ലഴി) is a {{suburban}} area of Thrissur City of Kerala state, South India. It is almost 6 km away from Swaraj Round. Pullazhy {{is surrounded by}} paddy fields called [...] "Kolpadavu", supervised and controlled by Pullazhi Kolpadavu Sahakarana Sangham. Many of the native families have an agrarian background. The village also contains a library called Yuvajana Sangham Vayanasala. An AG(Accountant General)'s Quarters is situated in this village. Head office of Thrissur Circle of Archaeological Survey of India is functioning inside the Green Valley colony. [...] "Kerala Lakshmi Mill" [...] is functioning in Pullazhy having 42944 <b>spindle</b> <b>capacity</b> which produces carded polyester-cotton yarn.This mill is owned by national textile cooperation(NTC) govt.of India undertaking. Pullazhi is Ward 47 of Thrissur Municipal Corporation. This village contains a Working Women Hostel run by Kerala State Housing Board.|$|E
50|$|Launched {{later in}} 2000, {{this was the}} last Fireball LCT series. It had 512 KB of cache, an ATA-6 {{interface}} and a 4500 RPM <b>spindle</b> speed. <b>Capacities</b> available were 10, 20, 30 and 40 GB with up to two platters.|$|R
50|$|Four {{distinct}} {{series of}} Quantum Bigfoot drives were produced over time, with differences in <b>capacity,</b> <b>spindle</b> speed, access time and supported interface speed.|$|R
5000|$|Locks {{and steel}} safes are {{manufactured}} in Dindigul and operated as a co-operative sector. Locks manufactured in Dindigul {{are sold in}} national and international markets and is well known all over India for its quality. The Tamil Nadu State Council for Science and Technology, through its research officers wing, has filed geographical indication for Dindigul locks. A decline in lock industry is observed in modern times and other industries like leather, handloom, and aggro opportunities have gained significance. Silk, muslin and blanket manufacturing is common in Dindigul and after Coimbatore, the city has the second largest textile <b>spindling</b> <b>capacity</b> in the State. Chinnalapatti silk, a brand of silk saree is produced out of Chinnalapatti located 11 km from the city. [...] The climate condition of the region is conducive for horticulture and agriculture. The district at large produce non-food crops like coffee, flowers, tobacco, and eucalyptus. Dindigul is the center for wholesale trading of fruits like orange, pineapple, sapota and guava, and vegetables like onion.|$|R
50|$|The {{group was}} earlier known as Abhishek Industries. It was {{incorporated}} on April 18, 1990 {{in the state}} of Punjab. In 1992, the company started implementing its yarn spinning project in joint sector with PSIDC to set up manufacturing facilities for cotton yarn with an installed <b>capacity</b> of 24,960 <b>spindles.</b> Subsequently, the <b>capacity</b> was upgraded to 32,400 spindles. In the year 1998, PSIDC and the company set up another unit of 43,392 spindles at a capital outlay of Rs. 9500 lacs out of which 36,288 spindles started commercial production from July 1, 1999.|$|R
40|$|By using {{monopolar}} spindles artificially induced in {{sea urchin}} embryos, we examined {{whether or not}} the presence of two opposing poles was an indispensable condition for keeping chromosomes at a fixed distance from the pole at metaphase and for the anaphase chromosome movement. Chromosomes were stained with Hoechst dye 33342 and their behavior was followed in the monopolar and the control bipolar spindles. In the monopolar spindle, chromosomes were first arranged on a curved metaphase plate and then spread on a part of the imaginary surface of a sphere whose center was the monopole. The estimated chromosome-to-pole distance was similar to that of bipolar spindles at metaphase and remained fixed until chromosomes started to move toward the pole. The average duration of metaphase in the monopolar spindle was 6 times longer than that in the bipolar spindle. The poleward movement of chromosomes in the monopolar spindle was similar to the anaphase A (chromosome-to-pole movement) in the bipolar spindle with respect to the velocity, duration, distance, and synchronization of migration. These results show that even half of the normal <b>spindle</b> has <b>capacities</b> for the arrangement of chromosomes at metaphase and for the anaphase A chromosome movement. Based on these results, we were able to exclude some existing theories of metaphase, such as the one based on the balance of forces between the two poles...|$|R
50|$|Adamjee Jute Mills {{was set up}} by Abdul Wahid Adamjee, Pakistan's {{foremost}} industrialist, and {{scion of}} the wealthiest family in the country. Initially, the said project was a partnership between the Adamjees and the PICIC (the government's industrial arm). The Adamjee family, however, soon took control of the project, and eventually built it into the largest jute mill in the world.At the time of partition of Bengal in 1947, there were 108 jute mills in Bengal but all of them fell to the share of India. The government of Pakistan encouraged Muslim entrepreneurs to come forward with proposals for establishment of jute mills in the country, following which Adamjee Brothers of calcutta agreed to act as a promoter and presented an investment plan in December 1949. In line with its proposal, Adamjee Brothers contributed 50% of the share capital while the Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC) sanctioned the rest of the capital. The proposed site for the new mill was Siddhirganj, about six kilometres north of Narayanganj, which had good river, road and rail communication facilities. Two hundred twenty seven acres of land was acquired and developed for the construction of the mill. PIDC arranged for import of machinery and equipment for the mill with government grants of foreign exchange and by June 1955, the mill was ready for commissioning and had 3000 looms and 31200 <b>spindles.</b> The production <b>capacity</b> of the mill was 117 ton of twist and yarn, 953 ton of hessian and 4006 ton of sacking bag.The Adamjee family lost control of the mill in 1971 during the Bangladesh Liberation War. It employed over 26,000 workers at its height.|$|R
40|$|Twenty seven muscle {{spindles}} {{from six}} extraocular muscles removed following ocular enucleation from patients aged 58, 76 and 74 years were examined throughout {{all or most}} of their length by means of light and electron microscopy using serial transverse sections. Five others were prepared in longitudinal section. Twelve spindles of the superior rectus muscle from three sheep orbits were studied in a similar manner to provide a comparison. The human spindles contained a total of 90 (42 %) nuclear chain and 5 (2 %) nuclear bag fibres with the usual complement of sensory endings, and 120 (56 %) fibres were anomalous with continuous, unattenuated myofibrils throughout their length, a constant width and peripherally placed nuclei. Eight anomalous fibres received sensory terminals similar in form to those of chain and bag fibres. Most (26) spindles contained at least one chain and one anomalous fibre. The periaxial space was limited or absent and the inner capsule was often segmented and in contact with the outer capsule. Abrupt termination of some chain fibres including several with one pole missing, together with evidence of fibre fragmentation and other structural anomalies, were indicative of degeneration. Eight further encapsulated fibre groups were identified as false spindles containing only anomalous fibres; associated nerves failed to terminate in the encapsulations. Sheep spindle content was of regular form, all spindles containing several chain and at least one bag fibre enclosed by an inner capsule and surrounded by a substantial periaxial space equatorially. The human extraocular muscle spindles have lost, either by aging or phylogenetically, the privilege of contractile chambers isolated by a fluid periaxial space from extrafusal fibre activity and sensory terminals are subject to the direct mechanical influences of anomalous intrafusal fibres. These, and the other departures from normal structure described, must jeopardize monitoring of muscle activity in the manner normally attributed to <b>spindles</b> and their <b>capacity</b> to provide useful proprioceptive information is questionable...|$|R
