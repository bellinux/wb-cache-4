40|$|A pilot {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} with the aim to evaluate the possibilities and results of logistic slaughter of pigs (separate slaughter of salmonella-free and salmonella-infected pig herds) under usual circumstances in a Dutch slaughterhouse. During the experiment salmonella-free herds were delivered and slaughtered on Tuesday mornings. Herds delivered on Thursday mornings served as a control group. No significant difference {{could be found in}} the number of salmonella-positive carcasses on Tuesdays and Thursdays. This was mainly caused by contamination of carcasses by contaminated slaughter equipment; 80 % of all salmonella strains on carcasses were equal to strains isolated from slaughter equipment.

40|$|Abstract Background On 20 – 21 February 2006, six {{cases of}} diarrhoea-associated {{haemolytic}} uraemic syndrome (HUS) {{were reported by}} paediatricians to the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. We initiated an investigation to identify the etiologic agent and determine {{the source of the}} outbreak in order to implement control measures. Methods A case was defined as a child with diarrhoea-associated HUS or any person with an infection with the outbreak strain of E. coli O 103 (defined by the multi-locus variable number tandem repeats analysis (MLVA) profile) both with illness onset after January 1 st 2006 in Norway. After initial hypotheses-generating interviews, we performed a case-control study with the first fifteen cases and three controls for each case matched by age, sex and municipality. Suspected food items were sampled, and any E. coli O 103 strains were typed by MLVA. Results Between 20 February and 6 April 2006, 17 cases were identified, of which 10 children developed HUS, including one fatal case. After pilot interviews, a matched case-control study was performed indicating an association between a traditional cured sausage (odds ratio 19. 4 (95 % CI: 2. 4 – 156)) and STEC infection. E. coli O 103 :H 25 identical to the outbreak strain defined by MLVA profile was found in the product and traced back to contaminated mutton. Conclusion We report an outbreak caused by a rare STEC variant (O 103 :H 25, stx 2 -positive). More than half of the diagnosed patients developed HUS, indicating that the causative organism is particularly virulent. Small ruminants continue to be important reservoirs for human-pathogen STEC. Improved <b>slaughtering</b> <b>hygiene</b> and good manufacturing practices for cured sausage products are needed to minimise the possibility of STEC surviving through the entire sausage production process. </p...|$|R
40|$|Cystic {{echinococcosis}} {{occurs in}} most regions of sub-Saharan Africa, but {{the frequency of}} this zoonosis differs considerably among and within countries.

40|$|The {{study was}} carried out in three abattoirs {{supplying}} meat to butcheries in Nairobi, and its environs. The objectives of the study were to assess the level of contamination of carcasses with E. coli O 157 :H 7 in the slaughterhouses, determine the critical control points and train the slaughterhouse managers on practices to reduce carcass contamination. Three slaughterhouses with different level of hygiene control, classified as export, local improved and typical local, were selected. Three hundred cattle were tracked along the slaughtering process to sample faeces and carcass. A rectal faecal sample f was taken from each animal after stunning. Two carcass sites, flank and brisket were swabbed after flaying, evisceration and washing. In total seven samples were taken from each carcass. E. coli O 157 was isolated by culture and serotyped using card agglutination test. The isolates were further tested for verotoxin production. Monte Carlo simulation was run to determine the risk of carcass contamination. A HACCP model was developed for one of the abattoirs. Interviews were done with slaughter house workers to test their knowledge, attitudes and practices towards <b>slaughtering</b> <b>hygiene.</b> Identified gaps on <b>hygiene</b> from <b>slaughter</b> personnel questionnaire were used to develop training materials for slaughterhouse managers and staff. E. coli O 157 was detected from the faecal and carcasses samples at different stages of carcass dressing. Two hundred and eighty (280) out of 2, 100 samples (13. 3 %) were IMViC (++ [...] ) positive for E. coli. Sorbitol MacConkey negative isolates were presumptive E. coli O 157. After serotyping with O 157, 92 out of 280 (4. 3 %) isolates, were positive for E. coli O 157. Forty-two isolates of the 92 were tested for verotoxin production, eight were positive for VT 1 only while two were positive for both VT 1 and VT 2. The risk of a carcass being contaminated with E. coli O 157 in the abattoir was 29, 38 and 48 carcasses per 1000 slaughtered animals for the export, the typical local and the local improved abattoirs respectively at 90 % confidence interval. There were significant differences in prior training received by the workers in the typical local abattoir and the local improved (p= 0. 001) but {{there was no significant difference}} between the export and the typical local slaughterhouse and between the export and the local improved slaughterhouse. There was a significant difference (p= 0. 025) noted in the hand washing practice between the local improved and the typical local slaughterhouse. Number of workers playing more than one role in the slaughter process was also significant (p= 0. 027) between the typical local and the local improved slaughterhouse. These factors may have contributed in the differences in carcass contamination in the three slaughterhouses. Slaughterhouse owners and staff were trained on good hygienic practices, food borne illnesses and risk of contamination of carcasses. Evaluation done one month after the training showed there was no change in the hygiene practices of the workers. This may have been contributed by lack of facilities like hot water, soap and disinfectants in typical and local improved slaughterhouses. Lack of motivation by the management and paying of the workers depending on the kill may affect the hygiene levels and workers attitude towards hygiene. This study shows that there is a risk of carcass contamination with E. coli O 157 in all the different categories of slaughterhouses. Workers and operations hygiene are important factors contributing to this risk...|$|R

The number of patients diagnosed with Y enterocolitica 0 : 3 infection declined consistently from 1500 cases in 1985 to 265 cases in 2000. Two cross-sectional studies carried out at the slaughterhouse showed a seroprevalence in finishers of 66. 7 % in 1993, compared with 69. 2 % in 2000.

40|$|Of 504 tonsil {{samples from}} {{slaughtered}} fattening pigs, 5. 6 % were positive for Listeria monocytogenes by culture after enrichment. The 28 L. monocytogenes isolates were analyzed to gain insights into genetic relationships and virulence-associated traits. Of the 28 isolates, 57 % belonged to serotype 1 / 2 a (genetic lineage II), 25 % to serotype 4 b (genetic lineage I) and 18 % to serotype 1 / 2 b (genetic lineage I). These serotypes are {{commonly associated with}} human listeriosis cases. Multilocus sequence typing assigned the 28 isolates to 16 clonal complexes (CCs) and three singletons, including one new sequence type (ST 768). Several of these CCs were also found in strains from human infections. Sequence analysis of the whole internalin A gene (inlA) showed that all but one isolate (CC 6 /serotype 4 b) encoded full-length proteins. Clinical strains from human patients commonly harbor full-length inlA. On the other hand, genes for benzalkonium chloride tolerance were not found and all but one isolate lacked genes for the stress survival islet (SSI- 1). Thus, tonsils of slaughtered fattening pigs can be colonized with L. monocytogenes of public health impact. To counteract this threat during slaughter, prevention of contamination of carcasses and the environment is of major importance, in particular adherence to good <b>slaughter</b> <b>hygiene</b> practice. With regard to pig tonsils, special attention {{must be given to}} the handling and contamination of head meat and pig tongues...|$|E
40|$|Consumers’ {{motivations and}} {{behaviour}} towards food safety, animal welfare {{and the environment}} in beef production and beef products were discussed in several focus groups, within a broader research program aiming at determining Portuguese consumers’ willingness to pay for safer, cleaner and animal friendlier beef. Regarding the supply context, food safety, animal welfare and environmental protection are, to some extent, jointly produced within beef production systems. From the demand perspective there are also reasons to believe consumers aren’t able to separately value {{each one of these}} outputs of beef production. Due to considerable difficulties in production costs allocation as well as willingness to pay valuation, there are therefore reasons to jointly value them in a multi-dimensional package. Six focus groups were used to elicit how respondents perceive and talk about these topics and to provide insights into their motivations towards beef. Results show that respondents often refer intrinsic attributes as determinants of beef quality. The main quality cues at the moment of purchase include appearance, expiration date and price. Beef safety is generally taken for granted. However, concerns include hormones, antibiotics and <b>slaughter</b> <b>hygiene.</b> Environmental concerns are mainly linked with pollution and recycling. Animal welfare concerns include transportation, slaughtering and rearing conditions. There are mixed reactions when it comes to willingness to pay premiums for any of the three given attributes.

40|$|Pig rearing is an {{important}} income source in the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR), with many smallholder farmers using traditional free-range pig production systems. Despite the potentially significant health risks posed by pig production regarding pig-associated zoonoses, information on the sociocultural drivers of these zoonoses is significantly lacking. This review summarises the existing sociocultural knowledge on eight pig-associated zoonoses suspected to be endemic in Southeast Asia: brucellosis, Q fever (Coxiella burnetii), trichinellosis, hepatitis E virus, leptospirosis, Japanese encephalitis, Streptococcus suis and Taenia solium taeniasis-cysticercosis. It summarises current knowledge on these diseases grouped according to their clinical manifestations in humans to highlight the propensity for underreporting. A literature search was conducted across multiple databases for publications from 1990 {{to the present day}} related to the eight pig-associated zoonoses and the risk and impact connected with them, with Lao PDR as a case study. Many of these pig-associated zoonoses have similar presentations and are often diagnosed as clinical syndromes. Misdiagnosis and underreporting are, therefore, substantial and emphasise the need for more robust diagnostics and appropriate surveillance systems. While some reports exist in other countries in the region, information is significantly lacking in Lao PDR with existing information coming mainly from the capital, Vientiane. The disease burden imposed by these zoonoses is not only characterised by morbidity and mortality, but directly impacts on livelihoods through income reduction and production losses, and indirectly through treatment costs and lost work opportunities. Other factors crucial to understanding and controlling these diseases are the influence of ethnicity and culture on food-consumption practices, pig rearing and <b>slaughter</b> practices, <b>hygiene</b> and sanitation, health-seeking behaviours and, therefore, risk factors for disease transmission. Published information on the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs of people regarding pig zoonoses and their risk factors is also extremely limited in Lao PDR and the broader Southeast Asian region. The need for more transdisciplinary research, using a One Health approach, {{in order to understand the}} underlining social determinants of health and their impacts on health-seeking behaviours, disease transmission and, ultimately, disease reporting, cannot be more emphasized.

40|$|Contamination of {{meat with}} {{microorganisms}} during <b>slaughter</b> is inevitable. <b>Hygiene</b> management systems (HMSs) {{such as the}} Hygiene Assessment System (HAS) and Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) are used to prevent the contamination of beef with both spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms during slaughter. This study compared {{the effect of the}} HAS alone and a combination of HAS + HACCP on the microbiological quality of beef and investigated the survival of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 co-cultured with different levels of Pseudomonas fluorescens and Lactobacillus plantarum on fresh beef. HAS alone and HAS combined with HACCP systems were each represented by two abattoirs. Sponge swab samples were collected from chilled beef carcasses for indicator organisms: Aerobic Plate Counts (APC), Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp., and lactic acid bacteria. Swabs were also collected for pathogenic bacteria: E. coli O 157 :H 7, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella spp. There {{was no significant difference between}} the microbiological quality of beef carcasses processed in the abattoirs with the HAS and that of beef carcasses processed in abattoirs with combined HAS + HACCP. E. coli O 157 :H 7 was isolated from carcasses processed in an abattoir with the combined HAS + HACCP system. Moreover, although overall S. aureus counts at all abattoirs were comparable, a higher incidence (47 % of carcasses) was obtained from an abattoir with combined HAS + HACCP. Salmonella spp. was not detected during the study. The microbiological quality of beef at HAS abattoirs is not significantly different to that of beef processed at HAS + HACCP abattoirs. The combined HAS + HACCP did not prevent contamination of beef carcasses with E. coli O 157 :H 7 and S. aureus. Effective implementation of HAS can reduce contamination of beef with spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms. The effect of different levels of P. fluorescens (102 and 106 log 10 cfu/ml) and L. plantarum (102 and 104 log 10 cfu/ml) on the survival of E. coli O 157 :H 7 on beef loins was investigated. Sterile beef loins inoculated with E. coli O 157 :H 7 and P. fluorescens were aerobically stored for 7 days at 4 °C, while those inoculated with E. coli O 157 :H 7 and L. plantarum were vacuum-packaged and stored for 8 weeks at 4 °C. APC, E. coli O 157 :H 7 and either P. fluorescens or L. plantarum counts were determined at different storage intervals. For the aerobically packaged beef loins, E. coli O 157 :H 7 was detected throughout the 7 -day storage period regardless of the P. fluorescens level in the inoculum. For the vacuum packaged beef loins, similar inoculum levels of E. coli O 157 :H 7 and L. plantarum allowed E. coli O 157 :H 7 to survive until week 5 of storage, while a higher inoculum level of L. plantarum inhibited E. coli O 157 :H 7 from week 3. Once fresh beef has been contaminated with E. coli O 157 :H 7 the level of P. fluorescens in the background flora does not inhibit its survival and growth. However, under vacuum storage, the application of L. plantarum as a biopreservative inhibits the survival of E. coli O 157 :H 7 on beef. Comprehensive strengthening of preventive strategies is required to eliminate contamination of beef carcasses with E. coli O 157 :H 7. Bacterial contamination of carcasses during slaughter is inevitable. Effective implementation of HAS at abattoirs produces beef carcasses of microbiological quality comparable to that produced through the use of combined HAS and HACCP. While the level of P. fluorescens on beef does not inhibit the survival of E. coli O 157 :H 7 on aerobically stored beef, the combination of L. plantarum, and low storage temperature inhibits the survival of this pathogen on beef under vacuum storage.

The majority (87. 5 %) of the 32 strains belonged to serotype 1 / 2 a (genetic lineage II), followed by serotype 4 b (genetic lineage I). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) grouped the 32 strains into 10 STs that {{were assigned to}} eight clonal complexes (CC 1, CC 4, CC 6, CC 8, CC 29, CC 37, CC 54, CC 90) and two singletons (ST 36, ST 200). ST 709 (CC 90) was designated {{for the first time}} and comprised 20 serotype 1 / 2 a strains from cattle and sheep. PCR screening for Listeriolysin S showed the presence of this virulence factor in the four lineage I/serotype 4 b strains belonging to CC 1, CC 4, CC 6, and CC 54. Sequence analysis of the whole internalin A gene (inlA) of 10 strains representing the 10 STs showed that all but one strain (CC 6 /serotype 4 b) encoded full-length proteins.

Detected values above the de- fined criteria require an improvement in <b>slaughter</b> <b>hygiene</b> and the reviewof process control. Themain source of microbiological contamination of beef carcasses along the slaughterline is of fecal origin, therefore Escherichia coli and Enterobacteriaceae seemto be themost suitable indicators to assess the hygienic status of the slaughter process. Althoughmicrobiological criteria addressing indicator bacteria have beeninplace inindustrializedcoun- tries for several years, scattered information still exists on factors affecting their counts on beef carcasses along the slaughterline. Therefore, a systematic literature review, covering the period 2000 – 2012, was conducted to gather information concerning: 1) counts of E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae on beef carcasses linked to different stages of the slaughterline; 2) factors influencing presence/counts of E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae on beef car- casses; and 3) the relationship between indicator bacteria (E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae) counts and visual fecal contamination of beef carcasses. According to the 41 retrieved papers the following conclusions were drawn. A decrease of the indicator bacteria counts was recorded after sequential decontamination treatments, such as pasteurization and hot water washing. Slaughterhouse characteristics influenced bacterial load of beef carcasses, although {{it was difficult to}} assess which factors (i. e., slaughterhouse throughput, design of the plant, surveillance system in place) had the greatest effect. Finally, carcasses from fecal contaminated animals had higher bacterial loads than those fromclean animals.

40|$|Mobile and semi-mobile abattoirs, {{in which}} animals can be {{slaughtered}} {{on the farm}} or near the farm, could be an alternative slaughtersystem to the conventional one. This alternative is aimed to minimize stress induced by handling and transport activities on animals prior to slaughtering, and thereby attenuate the risks for reduced meat quality. More over, minimized transport could lead to reduction of environmental degradation imposed by emissions generated from vehicles. The objective {{of the project was}} to map out possibilities and constrains associated with mobile abattoirs for cattle, sheep, swine and poultry, and to identify pertinent and steering parameters and factors which may determine the development and implement of mobile abattoirs. The project included a literature review, study visits to abattoirs for cattle and swine and a mobile abattoir for deer. Interviews with relevant individuals and organisations were also carried out. The proposals for the mobile abattoirs are based on the rules and regulations set up by 'Livsmedelsverket' concerning <b>slaughter</b> <b>hygiene</b> and the animal protection act concerning handling of slaughter animals. In common, for cattle, sheep swine and poultry slaughter, the suggested mobile abattoir comprises the following components: a component for stunning, slaughter and cooling and a separate cooling component for transportation of meat. In the semi-mobile abattoir, there will also be a component for butchering of meat. Water of good hygienic quality in sufficient amounts are needed. Slaughter waste may be decomposed after being heated to 70 ° C, which might be a problem in mobile abattoir. In semi-mobile, the waste could be handled easily. It is assumed that mobile and semi-mobile abattoirs could lead to a better handling of slaughter animals, which might decrease stress and give a better quality of meat. If transport of live animals could cease, as with mobile abattoirs, many factors related to stress could be eliminated. But there will always be some factors, for example, preloading handling, that can lead to stress even in mobile abattoir system.

40|$|Clostridium difficile is an {{anaerobic}} spore forming gram-positive bacterium. Infection with C. difficile {{may lead}} in humans to symptomless carriership, {{but may also}} lead to diarrhea varying in severity from mild to life-threatening pseudomembraneous colitis. C. difficile spores can survive {{for long periods of}} time in the environment and are resistant to extreme temperatures, drought, radiation, and chemicals including disinfectants. C. difficile was considered a classical nosocomial pathogen, with a risk group consisting of elderly patients with comorbidities, treated with antimicrobials. However, since the beginning of the 21 th century C. difficile infection (CDI) is increasing in incidence and severity, and is also reported in younger patients, not receiving antimicrobials, and in patients in the community. Ribotype 078 is associated with this change in epidemiology and has increased in prevalence, to the 3 rd most common isolated type in human patients in Europe. The finding of the same 078 ribotype in diarrheal piglets led to the concern that interspecies transmission could occur. The goal of this PhD research was to investigate the risk of transmission of C. difficile from pigs to humans. C. difficile was commonly found in fecal samples of neonatal piglets with diarrhea. The use of a more sensitive detection method for the bacterium resulted in isolating C. difficile in fecal samples of almost all piglets, regardless their disease status. With this method, samples from sows, piglets and the environment were investigated to determine how piglets become infected with C. difficile. Since C. difficile was found in all piglets within 48 hours after birth, while all sows became positive within 113 hours after parturition, contamination of the environment with C. difficile is the most logical source for infection. Indeed, C. difficile was present in environmental samples in the farm. C. difficile was also found in the air of the farrowing ward. Follow-up research on all pig wards at the same pig farm revealed a widespread dissemination of C. difficile. Furthermore, C. difficile was present in air samples 20 meter outside the farm. Consumption of pork meat is considered a possible infection route, because C. difficile was found in retail pork samples. To determine if the source could be slaughter pigs colonized with the bacterium, rectal samples of slaughter pigs were taken at the abattoir. A prevalence of around 10 % was found. However, whether C. difficile can subsequently contaminate the carcass depends on the <b>slaughter</b> <b>hygiene.</b> Human and pig C. difficile ribotype 078 seem to be genetically related because a comparison of C. difficile isolates from humans with CDI and piglets with diarrhea revealed a high similarity in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. Samples from farmers, employees, family members and the pigs at the same farms were investigated for the presence of C. difficile. Colonization rates of C. difficile in pig farmers and their employees were higher then the colonization rates described in healthy adults. C. difficile isolates from pig farmers and their pigs are highly similar, which indicates that working with pigs is an occupational risk for colonization with C. difficile...|$|E
