Marco Polo brought some glazes back to Italy in the 13th century. Agricola, around 1600, reports the use of borax as a flux in metallurgy. In 1777, boric acid was recognized in the hot springs (<b>soffioni)</b> near Florence, Italy, and became known as sal sedativum, with primarily medical uses. The rare mineral is called sassolite, which is found at Sasso, Italy. Sasso was {{the main source of}} European borax from 1827 to 1872, when American sources replaced it. Boron compounds were relatively rarely used until the late 1800s when Francis Marion Smith's Pacific Coast Borax Company first popularized and produced them in volume at low cost.|$|E

For such natural steam-holes, the French geologists often use the term soufflards in place of the Italian <b>soffioni.</b>|$|E

50|$|The subsoil in Tuscany is {{relatively}} rich in mineral resources, with iron ore, copper, mercury and lignite mines, the famous <b>soffioni</b> (fumarole) at Larderello, {{and the vast}} marble mines in Versilia. Although its share is falling all the time, agriculture still contributes to the region's economy. In the region's inland areas cereals, potatoes, olives and grapes are grown. The swamplands, {{which used to be}} marshy, now produce vegetables, rice, tobacco, beets and sunflowers.|$|E
