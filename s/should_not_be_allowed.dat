5|$|Purified water {{should be}} used for {{watering}} purposes, although 'hard water' is tolerated. This is done to minimise the build-up of minerals and chemicals in the soil. Water purity greater than 100p.p.m. of total dissolved solids is often quoted as ideal. A reverse osmosis unit can be used to filter the water or, alternatively, bottled distilled water can be purchased. Watering should be done regularly. However, plants <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> to sit in water, as this may lead to root rot.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Chia mooted {{the idea}} that Singaporeans {{should be able to}} borrow from their own Central Provident Fund (CPF) savings to tide over periods of {{financial}} difficulty. His rationale was that if individuals could borrow from their own CPF accounts to buy depreciating property and money-losing stocks, there was no reason why they <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> to do so to pay for bills. Dr. Ong Seh Hong, MP for Aljunied GRC, opposed the view, stating that it was important and for the good of Singapore that Singaporeans were independent individuals who could assume the risks and successes of their investments and be self-sufficient.|$|E
5|$|In Bottomley's absence, {{his office}} {{explored}} {{the issue and}} resolved that Rhodesia could retain its representative in South Africa, but <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> to appoint another in Lisbon; a consul was acceptable, they concluded, but only {{as part of the}} British Embassy staff. Bottomley remained unaware of this progress until a call from his office on 25 June, whereupon he still did nothing. Unwilling to wait, Rhodesia confirmed Reedman's appointment the next day, much to Wilson's fury. Only now was Bottomley finally jolted into action; he informed Salisbury of his ministry's findings on 29 June, offering them the consul within the embassy, but refusing to sanction an independent office.|$|E

50|$|Bertha von Suttner {{is often}} {{considered}} {{a leader in}} the women's liberation movement. In Lay Down Your Arms, the protagonist Martha often clashes with her father on this issue. Martha does not want her son to play with toy soldiers and be indoctrinated to the masculine ideas of war. The father character attempts to put Martha back in the female gendered box by suggesting that the son will not need to ask for approval from a woman. He also states that Martha should be marry again because women her age <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>allow.</b>|$|R
5|$|By now the Ordainers {{had drawn}} up their Ordinances for reform and Edward had little {{political}} {{choice but to}} give way and accept them in October. The Ordinances of 1311 contained clauses limiting the King's right {{to go to war}} or to grant land without parliament's approval, giving parliament control over the royal administration, abolishing the system of prises, excluding the Frescobaldi bankers, and introducing a system to monitor the adherence to the Ordinances. In addition, the Ordinances exiled Gaveston once again, this time with instructions that he <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> to live anywhere within Edward's lands, including Gascony and Ireland, and that he should be stripped of his titles. Edward retreated to his estates at Windsor and Kings Langley; Gaveston left England, possibly for northern France or Flanders.|$|E
5|$|Fruit in {{blackcurrants}} {{is borne}} primarily on one-year-old shoots. Newly planted bushes should be pruned severely, cutting all shoots back to two buds above ground level. This gives the plant {{a chance to}} get properly established before needing to put its energy into producing fruit. The general rule when pruning is to remove all weak shoots and those growing out sideways which may get weighed down when fruiting. The remaining branches should be thinned so as to remove old unproductive wood and encourage new shoots. An established bush <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> to become overcrowded and should have about one third of its main branches or stems removed each year. When harvesting by machine, plants with an upright growth habit are encouraged.|$|E
5|$|In 1847, in {{response}} to perceived discrimination against First Nations people by the Hudson's Bay Company in the fur trade, Belcourt prepared a petition to Queen Victoria to seek redress. The petition was signed by 977 First Nations people, but the Colonial Secretary, Earl Grey, consulted with advisors who had little sympathy for the natives and took no action in the case. The Company criticised Belcourt for what it saw as his inciting discontent among the local First Nations. The Company administrators decided that the priest <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> to remain in British North America. The missionary was arrested, but was released after {{the charges against him}} were discovered to be unfounded. At the urging of the Company's Governor, the Archbishop of Quebec asked Belcourt to return to Montreal. Belcourt asked the Governor of the Company to retract the charges for which he was arrested. The Governor apologised for what he described as a mistake {{on the part of the}} Company's chief Factors.|$|E

Firstly, any association with self-abnegation is removed; and secondly, {{the value of a}} limited form of pride (recognition pride) is affirmed. The paper is nevertheless strongly continuous with her work {{in the sense that it}} builds upon her rejection of universalisability on the specific grounds that we have varying moral competences. A liberal commitment to equality <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>allow</b> to spill out of the political domain. We <b>are</b> <b>not</b> all equal when it comes to the demands of morality. Humility is treated as a just discernment of our own limited moral competences. As such, it is a recognition of our particularity and not a form of radical self-effacement...|$|R

Frustrated, Liston changed his management in 1961 and applied pressure through the media by remarking that Patterson, who had faced mostly white challengers since becoming champion, was drawing the color line against his own race.|$|E
25|$|Following President Enrique Peña Nieto's {{proposal}} to legalize same-sex marriage in Mexico, a poll {{on the issue}} {{was carried out by}} Gabinete de Comunicación Estratégica. 69% of respondents were in favor of the change. 64% said they saw it as an advance in the recognition of human rights. Public opinion has changed radically over the course of 16 years. In 2000, 62% felt that same-sex marriage <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> under any circumstances.

25|$|Besides {{elevating}} privacy concerns, HTML5 {{also adds}} a few tools to enhance user privacy. A mechanism is defined whereby user agents can share blacklists of domains that <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> to access web storage. Content Security Policy is a proposed standard whereby sites may assign privileges to different domains, enforcing harsh limitations on JavaScript use to mitigate cross-site scripting attacks. HTML5 also adds HTML templating {{and a standard}} HTML parser which replaces the various parsers of web browser vendors. These new features formalize previously inconsistent implementations, {{reducing the number of}} vulnerabilities though not eliminating them entirely.|$|E

An IPCC spokesman expressed the view that Mr Geenty <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed</b> to retire until the investigation and any subsequent proceedings were completed.

However, rumors about a reincarnation of the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu appeared in northern Mongolia in that same year. No traditional determination of the supposed incarnation was conducted. Another rumor appeared in 1925. In November 1926 the 3rd Great Khural of Mongolian People's Republic approved a special resolution that searches for reincarnations of the Bogd Gegen <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>allowed.</b> A final prohibition {{was approved by the}} 7th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the 5th People's Great Khural in 1928.|$|E
