25|$|George {{noted that}} most debt, though bearing the {{appearance}} of genuine capital interest, was not issued {{for the purpose of}} creating true capital, but instead as an obligation against rental flows from existing economic privilege. George therefore reasoned that the state should not provide aid to creditors in the form of sheriffs, constables, courts, and prisons to enforce collection on these illegitimate obligations. George did not provide any data to support this view, but in today's developed economies, much of the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> is created to purchase claims on future land rents, rather than to finance the creation of true capital. Michael Hudson and Adair Turner estimate that about 80 percent of credit finances real estate purchases, mostly land.|$|E

International literature (both theoretical and empirical) documents that the main determinants <b>of</b> trade <b>credit</b> <b>supply</b> are {{the size of the}} firm and the size of its debt.

The results obtained using a sample of 157 Brazilian companies do not support that size and indebtedness are relevant determinants for trade credit supply, but they confirm the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> trade <b>credit</b> as a strategic tool for the firms. Additionally we observed a significant decrease in trade credit supply in 2008, the year in which a severe international financial crisis took place...|$|R

40|$|This study {{provides}} evidence that shocks to the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> trade finance have a causal effect on U. S. exports. The identification strategy exploits {{variation in the}} importance of banks as providers <b>of</b> letters <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> across countries. The larger a U. S. bank's share of the trade finance market in a country is, the larger should be the effect on exports to that country if the bank reduces its <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> letters <b>of</b> <b>credit.</b> We find that supply shocks have quantitatively significant effects on export growth. A shock of one standard deviation to a country's <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> trade finance decreases exports, on average, by 2 percentage points. The effect is much larger for exports to small and risky destinations and in times when aggregate uncertainty is high. Our results imply that global banks affect export patterns and suggest that trade finance {{played a role in the}} Great Trade Collapse...|$|R
40|$|The credit {{view is that}} a {{monetary}} tightening affects the real economy by shifting the <b>supply</b> schedule <b>of</b> bank <b>credit</b> left. While bank credit typically contracts following {{a monetary}} tightening, the financial contraction {{does not necessarily mean}} a shift <b>of</b> the <b>supply</b> schedule. Testing the credit view requires the identification of the shifts of the demand and <b>supply</b> schedules <b>of</b> <b>credit.</b> Using an original approach, this study shows that the credit view is supported for Japan. The credit view is, however, composed of two different views, namely the lending view and the balance-sheet view. While the balance-sheet view implies that the cutback of lending has no impact on the real economy, the lending view implies independent impacts of the cutback. Given the acceptance <b>of</b> the <b>credit</b> view, this study further attempts to test the balance-sheet view against the lending view. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{determinant}} factors <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> {{and demand for}} trade credit by micro, {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (MSMEs), using data collected in a survey of managers from 481 firms in 32 cities in the states of São Paulo and Minas Gerais (Brazil) between 2008 and 2010. The multivariate relationship model proposed here is grounded in trade credit, agency and transaction costs theories. This study is based on a technique known as path analysis that uses a system of simple regressions estimated by simultaneous equations. The main results show the following: (i) trade credit and short-term bank loans are supplementary (and not substitute) sources of funds for MSMEs, which demonstrates that trade credit can be used by financial institutions as an indicator of the creditworthiness of the company; (ii) the proportion <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> sales, the days sales outstanding measure and sales growth are positively related to the amount <b>of</b> trade <b>credit</b> demanded, which suggests that trade credit is transferred along the supply chain; and (iii) the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> trade <b>credit</b> is positively related to the importance that management ascribes to both internal capital and bank credit, which illustrates the strategic use <b>of</b> the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> trade <b>credit</b> to increase sales. These results have important implications for companies' managers, financial institutions and the government agencies responsible for formulating policies that support and promote the development of small and medium-sized enterprises. </p...|$|R
30|$|Informal {{employment}} {{is an important}} labor market problem in most developing countries with implications on social safety, protection, and access to health services for millions of poor households. Informality also limits the collection of public tax revenues and creates a wedge in labor markets. This paper is not concerned with the reasons for informality but with the natural reduction of the share of informality in small, open economies which experience rapid phases of globalization and financial integration. Integration has the benefit of (i) increasing the <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> in the domestic economy and (ii) creating economies of scale with more productive firms dominating sales. More specifically, liberalization and integration attract both international firms for domestic production and cheaper credits that are passed onto consumers that had previously face borrowing constraints. As {{a result of this}} phase, modes of consumption and payments are typically modernized and old consumption habits die in developing countries.|$|R
