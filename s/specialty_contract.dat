To date, little is known about how the changes associated with these trends are being addressed by Construction Management (CM) programs. This research is a first step in addressing the problems faced by educators through an attempt to identify and describe activities of ASC member construction management programs relative to several recent trends (sustainability, building information modeling, jobsite field management, mechanical <b>specialty</b> <b>contracting,</b> electrical <b>specialty</b> <b>contracting,</b> Lean construction, and integrated project delivery). A survey was sent to 126 ASC administrators for member schools with a 34 % response rate. The results indicate a wide range of adoption and treatment of the identified trends. Some trends that were lacking attention included Lean construction, mechanical <b>specialty</b> <b>contracting</b> and electrical <b>specialty</b> <b>contracting.</b> These data provide a broad overview of the state of educational efforts in CM programs...|$|R

40|$|Currently, no widely {{accepted}} management practices for specialty construction contractors are {{standard in the}} industry. Review of the literature confirmed that, to date, scientific method {{has been applied to}} research about management practices in this industry. Also, less research has been devoted to the <b>specialty</b> <b>contracting</b> area than the general contracting area. There is no confirmed set of practices that are correlated to profitability. Instead, despite these practices having crucial impact on project safety, cost, production quality, schedules, and the firm’s overall business health, specialty contractors have had to learn and adapt their construction practices on trial and error experience. Total Quality Management and Lean Production Methodology do not go far enough. They lead to a framework and stop short of capturing prescriptive practices. To redress that gap in the industry, this research strives to identify a set of practices correlated with above-average efficiency in the <b>specialty</b> <b>contracting</b> organization. The term used here, “good operating practices” describes the actions that each contractor can execute continuously and exceed competitor’s financial performance. A methodology was developed to standardize specific, measurable, and efficient operating practices. Several industry sources contributed specific practices used for testing. This type of research is a new line of inquiry into the <b>specialty</b> <b>contracting</b> areas. The results of the study indicate that practices valued by the firm must be executed often. The financial correlation shows the level of disparity between importance and performance predicts whether a firm exceeds or does not exceed peer performance. There are some universal practices that are rated highest by all participating contractors. However, some variance exists in specific practices for each contractor depending on its characteristics. This paper concludes that specialty contractors must execute “good operating practices” consistently if they are to exceed their peer overhead efficiency average. This is {{the next step in the}} TQM and Lean journeys. This is a prescriptive system and not a set of guidelines...|$|R

40|$|Specialty {{contractors}} (SCs) are construction's `job shops'. They must allocate {{their resources}} {{to match the}} various `delivery' dates demanded by multiple projects. Managing {{the production of a}} <b>specialty</b> <b>contracting</b> firm is, consequently, quite different from managing a project. Further, specialty contractor management depends upon the quality of production management on projects, i. e., their coordination by general contractors.

As penal bonds were under seal, preference was also given to them over simple debts in the event of debtor insolvency. Despite these minor advantages, the core fact remained that after “the limitation of the early eighteenth century, regardless of the penalty specified in the bond, the value of the underlying promise represented a ceiling on the plaintiff’s recourse against the defendant.” ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Internationally, {{increasing}} numbers of women are practising medicine. Gender differences in doctors’ working hours, specialty choices and communication styles are well documented, but studies often neglect contextual {{factors such as the}} role of socialised gender expectations on behaviours in the workplace and the medical profession. These may be important as recent studies have reported gender differences in doctors’ activity rates that cannot be explained by <b>specialty</b> or <b>contracted</b> hours, suggesting other sources of variation. This study sought to explore the working lives of hospital doctors and how their work is negotiated according to gender and context. Design: Gender differences in the day-to-day work of hospital specialists (consultants) in the NHS were investigated using a qualitative approach, including observation and interview methods. Data were analysed inductively using qualitative observation and interview methods. Setting: Two NHS hospital trusts in England. Participants: Data were collected from 13 participants working in a variety of specialties and in a range of clinical and non-clinical settings. Main outcome measures: Various behaviours, attitudes and experiences were explored, such as doctor–patient communication, interactions with colleagues and workload. Results: Influences at both individual and situational levels, appear to affect differentially the work of male and female doctors. Female consultants described awareness of the impact of behaviours on relationships with colleagues, and their interactions appeared to be more carefully performed. Nurses and other colleagues tend to demonstrate less cooperation with female consultants. Gender differences also exist in patient communication, feelings of work–family conflict and barriers to career progression. Conclusions: These variations in hospital consultants’ work may have implications for both {{the quantity and quality of}} care provided by male and female consultants. This is timely and of importance to the medical workforce as the gender composition approaches parity...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} work {{presented in this}} thesis investigates collaboration in the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations (AECO) industry. More precisely, it investigates the characteristics of collaboration, their dynamics {{in the context of}} temporary and permanent organizations as well as the impact that the transition to innovative project delivery approaches, namely Building Information Modeling (BIM), is having on this collaboration. The research was practically motivated through our industrial partners’ desire to better understand the impact of BIM and other innovative project delivery approaches on project outcomes. The research was theoretically motivated by the lack of a clear definition of collaboration in the AECO industry and its seemingly amorphous nature. This scarcity of systematic and structured approaches to investigate collaboration and its outcomes in the literature confirmed this. The research was therefore both exploratory and prescriptive in nature. Its principal aim was to develop an artifact that allows consistent development, management and assessment of innovation enabled collaboration. As such, the research project was conducted using a design science research design. The research process continuously iterated between the development and building of the artifact and its local evaluation in context. In parallel, the artifact was concurrently evaluated to ensure its relevance and maintain the rigor of its development. A critical realist perspective was adopted to frame the epistemic and ontological foundation of knowledge being developed and also contradistinguish the predominantly pragmatic perspective traditionally adopted in design science research. The development and building of the artifact followed a systematic combining methodology. Showing similarities with grounded theory, this particular methodology accepts the a priori framing of knowledge to inform the investigation. It recognizes also that the knowledge held within this frame will evolve as the project progresses and as new insight is gained into the phenomena Under investigation. Mixed-methods of data collection were conducted on two main research sites to inform and support the research project. The first site was that of a large institutional designbuild project located in Edmonton, Alberta. Data collection on this site started in February 2013 and is still being carried out. The data collected on this site allowed an in-depth investigation of collaboration within a temporary project organization having fully implemented BIM. The second site was that of a <b>specialty</b> mechanical <b>contracting</b> small enterprise located in Vancouver, British Columbia. Data collection on this site started in April 2012 and ended in April 2015. The data collected on this site allowed a breadth of investigation into collaboration from an organizational perspective. Data was collected on four other sites to support relevance checks of the artifact being developed. The findings of the work are presented through the artifact, namely the constructs developed to characterize collaboration, a multi-layered model representing the relationships between the constructs and the method of operationalization of this model. The artifact serves to inform, manage and assess BIM-based collaboration {{in the context of this}} particular {{research work}}, though it could be extended to include other innovative project delivery approaches as future work. The artifact also evokes a substantive theory of collaboration in the AECO industry in the form of alignments amongst constructs developed in the model. Lastly, the artifact is operationalized to investigate the impact of BIM on collaboration in the AECO industry. The evolution of the different constructs and indicators, both measured and perceived, the alignments and misalignments uncovered as well as the outcomes of collaboration are evaluated through the artifact. Furthermore, the evolution of the constructs and the alignments uncovered through the artifact can serve as an indicator of performance within collaborative environments. Thus, the artifact developed in this research project solves the problem that was set out by the industrial partners. It also addresses the gap that was uncovered in the literature with respects to collaboration through innovation. Further work is required to fully evaluate the artifact, however, it is believed that the groundwork to move towards a more systematic and structured investigation into collaboration in the AECO industry has been laid...|$|R
40|$|This report aims {{to deliver}} a local view on factors likely to {{influence}} Patient Choice. The findings represent coverage in selected parts of the Bedfordshire and the immediate surrounding counties. There were 22 GP practices and 29 GPs interviewed using quantitative and qualitative research methods. In addition, 11 patients falling under Bedfordshire and Heartlands PCT completed a questionnaire enabling a like-for-like comparison against the completed GP surveys. Variations existed in the quantitative findings between GP and patient expectations, with a pragmatic approach taken by GPs, believing waiting times and locality would be the key driving forces influencing Patient Choice of provider for elective surgery. In contrast, patients considered reputation or expertise {{to be far more}} important along with a clean and comfortable environment. Interviews with GPs highlighted further key points: • 78 % of GPs refer 90 % or more patients to the local hospital in the same county. The main reasons attributed to this is local hospital/close proximity followed by offering <b>specialty</b> and PCT <b>contract.</b> • If provided with greater choice, 68 % of GPs said they were happy with the existing providers and would continue supporting local services. When probed on what criteria will be used to choose between future providers, reputation/specialty was the most commonly mentioned factor at 32 % followed by local services at 29 % and waiting list at 19 %. Moreover, supporting comments demonstrated; i) A reluctance to use alternative trusts for specialties when little information existed. A few GPs commented on the relationship which had been established over many years and would be difficult to replicate under Patient Choice. ii) Many patients were perceived to be inadequate at making sense of such data on specialties and consultants; it was commented that disseminating such data would lead to confusion, incorrect decision making and ultimately a waste of time with the end approval returning to GPs. • The results of GP authority on patients was reaffirmed with many considering the desired empowering effect of giving choice to patients will fail to materialise. Just under half the GPs surveyed said Patient Choice will have no impact with under a third stating it will {{have a negative impact on}} patients. There was a consensus amongst GPs and patients alike on the potential influencing power of GPs on Patient Choice. However, the patient results revealed that hospital performance report, reputation of hospital/media reports and recommendation of GP or other health professional were of equal importance, ranking at third place. This may due to a biased sample coming from an Expert Patient group. Impact on GPs was assessed with 57 % of practices believing Patient Choice will have negative repercussions with the booking system seen as extra work, taking time away from the allotted 10 minute consultation and once again returning to not knowing who the patient is being referred too. Overall, marketing in the NHS was seen as a good idea providing it served an informative purpose. It was interesting to observe the initial responses being negative followed by conditional positives. The idea around marketing serving to disseminate knowledge were supported with suggestions such as providing information on trusts, specialist units and consultants along with information on spare capacity and waiting times. Only 5 % of practices surveyed said that marketing material would have a negative effect. The majority, 57 % commented it would have a positive effect by raising awareness. GPs are happy to use local services with comparably short waiting times where good specialties are offered. If a trust has these offerings now and is able to continue with these offerings once Patient Choice has been launched in December 2005, minimal changes can be ex...|$|R
