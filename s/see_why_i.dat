500|$|Washington {{also claimed}} that American University cut off {{contact with him}} after he punched Tomjanovich. However, {{this appears to be}} a {{misrepresentation}} of certain events. When he tried to become athletic director of American in 1995, the school offered to hire him as assistant to the athletic director, since Washington had no front office experience. When confronted about this Washington stated: [...] "I didn't <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> couldn't be the AD so they could use my name out front and then have someone with more experience be my assistant." [...] John Feinstein and others have suggested that the most lasting damage caused by the fight between Washington and Tomjanovich has been to Washington's self-image, and his supposed refusal to accept responsibility for his actions in that fight. Pat later said it went deeper than that, as when she met him in college: ...|$|E
500|$|At {{this point}} Leveson Gower withdrew his {{invitation}} for Crawford {{to appear at}} the Scarborough Festival; Leveson Gower also prevented Crawford's selection for the MCC winter tour of South Africa. Crawford's father wrote to the Surrey committee {{in support of his}} son. By the beginning of August 1909, two weeks after the match against the Australians, the Surrey committee severed their connection with Crawford; Leveson Gower felt that he had shown the [...] "deepest ingratitude". Wisden reported: [...] "The committee were much incensed and passed a resolution that Crawford be not again asked to play for the county." [...] Informed of his expulsion by letter, Crawford replied to the committee a final time: [...] "I fail to <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> should practically be branded as a criminal because, as acting captain, I declined the responsibility of skippering a team which did not include three essential players, an independence which I trust will remain in spite of the awful example made of me to every amateur in the United Kingdom." ...|$|E
500|$|Sobers was met in Bridgetown by an {{enormous}} and hostile press storm. [...] "To {{say there was}} an uproar in the Caribbean is comprehensively to understate what took place," [...] the Jamaican politician Michael Manley later wrote in his History of West Indies Cricket. The Antigua Labour Party's Workers' Voice newspaper damned Sobers as [...] "a white black man" [...] and charged that by playing in Rhodesia, he had [...] "abdicated his loyalty to Africans everywhere, and all West Indians in particular". Manley's opinion was that if Sobers did not apologise, he [...] "may not be welcomed anywhere by {{people who believe that}} justice is bigger than even sport". Frank Walcott of the Barbados Workers' Union, who was a personal friend of Sobers, publicly called for his captaincy of the West Indies to be revoked, as did many others. Sobers told reporters at Seawell Airport that he had [...] "never been bothered about criticism, and I do not <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> should start now". Sympathy for Sobers amid the affair came mainly from his fellow Barbadians. Vernon Jamadar, Leader of the Opposition in Trinidad and Tobago, praised Sobers' [...] "calm dignity in response to the primitive savagery of West Indian gutter politicians".|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't <b>see</b> <b>why,</b> when <b>I</b> merely {{tried to}} have a little {{sensible}} conversation," [...] began Mac with reluctance, for he had been unmercifully chaffed by his cousins, to whom his brother had betrayed him.|$|R
500|$|On 15 March 1899 Bruce {{wrote to}} Sir Clements Markham at the RGS, {{offering}} {{himself for the}} scientific staff of the National Antarctic Expedition, then in its early planning stages. Markham's reply was a non-committal one-line acknowledgement, after which Bruce heard nothing for a year. He was then told, indirectly, {{to apply for a}} scientific assistant's post. On 21 March 1900 Bruce reminded Markham that he had applied a year earlier, and went on to reveal that he [...] "was not without hopes of being able to raise sufficient capital whereby I could take out a second British ship". He followed this up a few days later, and reported that the funding for a second ship was now assured, making his first explicit references to a [...] "Scottish Expedition". This alarmed Markham, who replied with some anger: [...] "Such a course will be most prejudicial to the Expedition A second ship is not in the least required I do not know why this mischievous rivalry should have been started". Bruce replied by return, denying rivalry, and asserting: [...] "If my friends are prepared to give me money to carry out my plans I do not <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> should not accept it [...] there are several who maintain that a second ship is highly desirable". Unappeased, Markham wrote back: [...] "As I was doing my best to get you appointed (to the National Antarctic Expedition) I had a right to think you would not take such a step without at least consulting me". He continued: [...] "You will cripple the National Expedition [...] in order to get up a scheme for yourself".|$|E

2500|$|William Fisher {{was killed}} in a riding {{accident}} when John was 15. John's relationship with his mother Sophie suffered from their separation, and he never saw her again. However, he continued to send her an allowance until her death. In 1870, she suggested visiting Fisher in England, but he dissuaded her as strongly as he could. Fisher wrote to his wife: [...] "I hate the very thought of it and really, I don't want to see her. I don't <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> should as I haven't the slightest recollection of her." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 19 January 2009, Bellamy {{completed}} his move to Manchester City on a four-and-a-half-year deal {{for an undisclosed}} fee believed to be around £14 million On signing for the club his new manager Mark Hughes stated, [...] "I'm sure Craig will be excellent for us, I think people will soon <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> wanted {{to bring him to}} the club. The fee that gets mentioned is invariably the wrong figure, it keeps being quoted as £19million, {{but that was not the}} price we paid for him." [...] This took his career total of transfers to £47m. Bellamy became the second major signing by Manchester City of the transfer window after Wayne Bridge from Chelsea.|$|E
2500|$|Frederick Taylor told Der Spiegel, [...] "I {{personally}} {{find the}} attack on Dresden horrific. It was overdone, it was excessive and is to be regretted enormously," [...] but, [...] "A war crime is a very specific thing which international lawyers argue about {{all the time and}} I would not be prepared to commit myself nor do I <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> should. I'm a historian." [...] Similarly, British philosopher A. C. Grayling has described British area bombardment as an [...] "immoral act" [...] and [...] "moral crime" [...] because [...] "destroying everything ... contravenes every moral and humanitarian principle debated in connection with the just conduct of war," [...] but, [...] "It is not strictly correct to describe area bombing as a 'war crime'.".|$|E
2500|$|Tyler {{has clearly}} spelled out the {{importance}} of her characters to her stories: [...] “As far as I’m concerned, character is everything. I never did <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> have to throw in a plot, too.” [...] In an earlier (1977) interview, she stated that “the real joy of writing is how people can surprise one. My people wander around my study until the novel is done. It’s one reason I’m {{very careful not to}} write about people I don’t like. If I find somebody creeping in that I’m not really fond of, I usually take him out.” [...] Pollitt had even earlier noted how Tyler’s characters seem to take on {{a life of their own}} that she doesn’t seem to totally control: “Her complex, crotchety inventions surprise us, but one senses they surprise her too.” ...|$|E

2500|$|On 31 August Sir John {{received}} {{messages from}} Joffre and President Poincare (relayed via Bertie, the British Ambassador) asking {{him not to}} withdraw. Joffre {{pointed out that the}} Germans were already shifting forces to the East. Kitchener demanded further details, and after showing French's previous message to the Cabinet telegraphed again warning that it was the manner and length of the retreat which concerned the Cabinet. Sir John then replied that the [...] "shattered condition" [...] of II Corps had reduced his offensive capability and that the BEF could not withstand an attack by so much as a single German corps. He wrote: [...] "I do not <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> should again be called upon to run the risk of absolute disaster in order a second time to save (the French)." [...] He also argued that the best solution would be for the French to counterattack and so [...] "close the gap by uniting their inward flanks", although he agreed to halt at Nanteuil, which he expected the BEF to reach the following day, if the French halted their own retreat. Kitchener, authorised by a midnight meeting of whichever Cabinet Ministers could be found, left for France for a meeting on 1 September.|$|E
2500|$|At a {{press conference}} ostensibly convened to promote [...] "Break Away" [...] to the European media shortly thereafter, Wilson intimated that [...] "We owe {{everyone}} money. And if we don't pick ourselves off our backsides and have a hit record soon, {{we will be in}} worse trouble... I've always said, 'Be honest with your fans.' I don't <b>see</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> should lie and say that everything is rosy when it's not." [...] These incendiary remarks ultimately thwarted long-simmering contract negotiations with Deutsche Grammophon. Although Murry Wilson's sale of the Sea of Tunes publishing company (including the majority of Wilson's oeuvre) to A Records' publishing division for $700,000 at the band's commercial nadir in 1969 renewed the longstanding animus between father and son, the younger Wilson stood in for Mike Love during a 1970 Northwest tour when Love was convalescing from illness. He also resumed writing and recording with the Beach Boys at a brisk pace; seven of the twelve new songs on the 1970 album Sunflower were either written or co-written by Wilson. Nevertheless, the album (retrospectively appraised as [...] "perhaps the strongest album they released post-Pet Sounds" [...] by Pitchfork) was a commercial failure in the US, peaking at number 151 during a four-week Billboard chart stay in October 1970. Following the termination of the Capitol contract in 1969, the band's new contract with then-au courant Reprise Records (brokered by Van Dyke Parks, employed as a multimedia executive at the company at the time) stipulated Brian Wilson's proactive involvement with the band in all albums, a factor that would become hugely problematic for the band in the years to come.|$|E
