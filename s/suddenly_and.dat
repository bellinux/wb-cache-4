5|$|Many of the North American {{species are}} in the genus Neotibicen: the annual or jar fly or dog-day cicadas (so named because they emerge in late July and August). The best-known North American genus, however, is Magicicada. These {{periodical}} cicadas have an extremely long life cycle of 13 or 17 years, <b>suddenly</b> <b>and</b> briefly emerging in large numbers.|$|E
5|$|Constantine {{grew up in}} an old priory in the Leicestershire {{village of}} Knipton and went hunting from the age of seven. She had a close {{relationship}} with her sister Annette Constantine and her father, Joseph Constantine, who was successful in the property and shipping sectors, was an Old Etonian pupil and served in the Coldstream Guards. When she was young, Constantine would rely on her father for fashion advice and has commented that any style that she has, she learned from him. He was a talented artist and was offered worldwide art exhibitions, although he was too modest to accept. His death came <b>suddenly</b> <b>and</b> was a milestone for Constantine.|$|E

5|$|Fighters Uncaged was {{announced}} by Ubisoft at Gamescom 2010, {{three months before}} its official release. There, people were allowed to preview the game. The game was developed by AMA Studios and published by Ubisoft exclusively for the Xbox 360 Kinect. Because the announcement came <b>suddenly</b> <b>and</b> close to the release date, video game journalists such as Christopher Grant of Engadget and Jamin Smith of VideoGamer were not intrigued. Grant was unimpressed by the game's announcement, criticizing the concept and its character designs and noted a misspelling in the preview. The game was originally planned to feature a multiplayer mode, though this was cut later on in development.|$|E
5|$|From 2007 to 2012, {{the number}} of round-leaved {{wintergreen}} footage increased by 50 percent. On the other hand, those of man orchid fall <b>suddenly</b> <b>and</b> continually. Whereas 27 plants were counted in 2003, the number reached a peak of 240 in 2006 with the uprooting of the wood small-reed, before collapsing to 13 plants in 2012, despite the continued management. The observation of gnawed seedlings can assume leaf consumption by herbivores. Protection against rodents was established in 2013 and will be evaluated at flowering.|$|E
5|$|Robert Selbie {{had fought}} vigorously for the {{independence}} of the Metropolitan Railway, and had successfully preserved the MR's independence during the grouping of 1923, which had merged almost all of Britain's railways into four companies. However, on 17 May 1930 he died <b>suddenly,</b> <b>and</b> his successors acceded to pressure from the Ministry of Transport to merge with London's other underground railways. On 1 July 1933 the merger brought all of London's underground railways aside from the short Waterloo & City Railway, under public ownership as part of the newly formed London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB). The Metropolitan Railway became the Metropolitan line of the London Underground.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1920 season, the spitball was banned by Major League Baseball. As a current spitball pitcher, Coveleski was grandfathered in, and was allowed to continue using the pitch until his retirement. He won his first seven starting appearances of the season, but on May 28, his wife died <b>suddenly,</b> <b>and</b> he was given some time off to mourn, returning to pitching two weeks later. Nearly three months later, he was the starting pitcher against the New York Yankees on August 16. In the game, Coveleski hit a sacrifice fly to help the Indians win, 4–3, but it was best remembered as the game where Yankees pitcher Carl Mays hit Ray Chapman, leading to the only death in MLB history from a pitch. He finished the 1920 regular season with 24 wins, 14 losses, a 2.49 ERA, and 133 strikeouts; he led the AL in strikeouts and finished second in ERA to Bob Shawkey.|$|E

5|$|Based on the {{findings}} of Brygida Kürbis, it can be concluded that the 10-year marriage of Przemysł II and Ludgarda wasn't successful, and over time it became more obvious to everyone that the ducal couple was unable to have children, although this couldn't be completely certain, because Ludgarda in 1283 was at most only 23 years old. Nevertheless, is assumed that Przemysł II's growing aversion to his wife because of her infertility was well known by all. So when in mid-December 1283 Ludgarda died <b>suddenly</b> <b>and</b> separated (evidenced by her death in Gniezno, away from Przemysł II's court in Poznań), raised suspicion that the death of the duchess was unnatural. Nobody, however, had evidence of this. Contributing to rumors was that in the 13th century medical knowledge was negligible, and therefore often sudden death of a young person was interpreted as unnatural. In addition, the duke's rejection of a proper mourning to his wife, who was universally liked, increased the suspicions against Przemysł II.|$|E
5|$|Houphouët-Boigny {{was also}} a major {{contributor}} to the political tensions in Biafra. Considering Nigeria a potential danger to French-influenced African states, Foccart sent Houphouët-Boigny and Lieutenant-Colonel Raymond Bichelot on a mission in 1963 to monitor political developments in the country. The opportunity to weaken the former British colony presented itself in May 1967, when Biafra, led by Lieutenant-Colonel Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, undertook to secede from Nigeria. French-aligned African countries supported the secessionists who, provided with mercenaries and weapons by Jean Mauricheau-Beaupré, began a civil war. By the end of the 1960s, French-supported nations <b>suddenly</b> <b>and</b> openly distanced themselves from France and Côte d'Ivoire's position on the civil war. Isolated on the international scene, both countries decided to suspend their assistance to Ojukwu, who eventually went into exile in Côte d'Ivoire.|$|E

Upon further investigation, the agents discover that the assassin shot through the roof, ceiling and ductwork, and into the victim.|$|E

While she is there, one of the bodies, now a vampire, gets up. After noticing Dawn has not come back, Buffy goes to look for her and finds her in the morgue, being attacked by the vampire. As Buffy fights and kills the vampire, the sheet falls from Joyce's face. Looking at her mother, Dawn asks where she went, as she reaches out to touch her cheek.|$|E
5|$|In this period, it {{was common}} for {{aspiring}} Australian artists to seek further training in Europe, particularly London and Paris. Henry Rix arranged to take his family there {{in conjunction with a}} trip he was making to study British education reforms, purchasing first-class tickets to travel in 1906. But Henry, who had been overworked and ill, died <b>suddenly,</b> <b>and</b> for a time it appeared the trip might not happen. Denied a widow's pension (Henry had been 58: too young for his wife to be eligible), the family had to reorganise their affairs and work out if they could afford to get to Europe. Finally, by combining an inheritance, rental income from their home, and money raised through the sale of works by both mother and daughter, they were able to trade the first class tickets for second class berths, and they set sail for England early in 1907.|$|E
5|$|Laporte died <b>suddenly,</b> <b>and</b> Benjamin Lumley {{took over}} the {{management}} in 1842, introducing London audiences to Donizetti's late operas, Don Pasquale and La fille du régiment. Initially, relations between Lumley and Michael Costa, the principal conductor at Her Majesty's were good. Verdi's Ernani, Nabucco and I Lombardi received their British premieres in 1845–46, and Lumley commissioned I masnadieri from the composer. This opera received its world premiere on 22 July 1847, with the Swedish operatic diva Jenny Lind {{in the role of}} Amalia, and the British premieres of two more Verdi operas, I due Foscari and Attila, followed in 1847–48. Meanwhile, the performers had continued to feel neglected and the disputes continued. In 1847, Costa finally transferred his opera company to the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, and the theatre relinquished the sobriquet, 'Italian Opera House', to assume its present title, Her Majesty's Theatre.|$|E

Several challenges await in the Dread Realm, with one such challenge being the party's strength <b>suddenly</b> <b>and</b> unexpectedly plummeting.

After returning to the Real World, everyone parts ways, with Ashlynn having to return to the Dream World since her Real World self doesn't exist anymore. With Mortamor's link between the Real World and the Dream World severed, the Dream World vanishes, with only Cloudgate Castle being the remaining visible portion in the Real World.

5|$|One of the Prussian playing-for-time {{requests}} to the Patriotic Party was {{that before the}} treaty is signed, {{they need to see}} more reforms within the Commonwealth government. In October 1789, the changing international situation (primarily the military defeats of the Ottoman Empire) <b>suddenly</b> <b>and</b> temporarily increased the value of an alliance with Poland for Prussia. In the meantime, the previously anti-royalist Patriotic Party has begun drifting closer to the king. In February and March 1790, concrete proposals were exchanged between Warsaw and Berlin. Some difficulties were centered around Prussian demands for the cession of Gdańsk and Toruń, and tariffs, but a threat of a Polish-Austrian alliance, recently brought forward by Austria, caused Prussia to withdraw most of the demands the Polish side was finding difficult to accept.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen {{toxicity}} is {{a catastrophic}} hazard in diving, because a seizure results in near certain death by drowning. The seizure may occur <b>suddenly</b> <b>and</b> with no warning symptoms. The effects are sudden convulsions and unconsciousness, during which victims can lose their regulator and drown. One {{of the advantages}} of a full-face diving mask is prevention of regulator loss {{in the event of a}} seizure. As there is an increased risk of central nervous system oxygen toxicity on deep dives, long dives and dives where oxygen-rich breathing gases are used, divers are taught to calculate a maximum operating depth for oxygen-rich breathing gases, and cylinders containing such mixtures must be clearly marked with that depth.|$|E
