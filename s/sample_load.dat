40|$|Abstract: Considering {{the special}} load {{characteristics}} of the wheel loader, this paper focus on compiling the load spectrum of the transmission of the wheel loader using the nonparametric statistical extrapolation method (NSEM). In this process, {{the determination of the}} kernel function shape is the critical issue, which has been discussed in detail. Before extrapolating the <b>sample</b> <b>load</b> spectrum, the signal denoising of the field-tested time-history load signals is performed. After that, the <b>sample</b> <b>load</b> cycles are obtained using the rainflow counting method and the corresponding kernel function shape is determined. Then the NSEM of rainflow matrix is proposed, by which the whole-life load spectrum is estimated. The proposed extrapolation method can well realize the estimation of the load cycles that do not appear in <b>sample</b> <b>load</b> cycles but may exist in the whole-life load history...|$|E
40|$|High-speed {{counter-current}} chromatography (HSCCC) is {{a versatile}} technique in preparative separation and purification of pure compounds from complex matrices. As a preparative chromatography, {{there is a}} need to maximize the column production. Based on the plate theory of Van Deemter, the effect of the <b>sample</b> <b>load</b> on the separation was investigated in a preparative HSCCC with a 1000 ml column capacity. The test samples of hydroquinone, pyrocatechol and phenol were separated using a two-phase solvent system of n-hexane–ethyl acetate–ethanol–water (1 : 1 : 1 : 1, v/v/v/v) at different sample loads. The results showed that for the case of HSCCC, the agreement of the effect of <b>sample</b> <b>load</b> on peak height and peak width between the Van Deemter 2 ̆ 7 s theory and the experiments is excellent. Furthermore, the factors limiting the mass load, including the resolution between the peaks, the partition isotherm and the solute solubility were also discussed...|$|E

The combined, operational budgets of these sites account for about 70 percent of the FY 1998 adjusted budget of the Office of Environmental Management (EM), which is responsible for managing waste and cleaning up contamination at DOE sites across the nation. In addition, these sites cover the spectrum of DOE-EM operations, comprising two sites (Fernald and Rocky Flats) on the accelerated path to closure by the year 2006 and four sites (those remaining) with operations continuing after 2006. Thus, the practices and needs of these sites can well represent the overall analytical service operations in support of the DOE-EM cleanup mission, both in the near term and in the long term. The survey findings indicated that by first approximation the DOE-EM complex-wide analytical service market is estimated at $ 114 million per year, with a yearly <b>sample</b> <b>load</b> of 284, 000 samples.

At this low level of <b>sample</b> <b>loading,</b> it becomes important to consider several very unique technical and fundamental aspects that are not obvious in compatible experiments with a higher amount of <b>sample</b> <b>loading.</b> We demonstrate that prudent matrix preparation allows analysis of peptides from solutions with picomolar concentrations in matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. Using microspot MALDI we demonstrate the introduction and detection of 25, 000 molecules of Substance P in a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. A method based on probability theory is presented to estimate the minimum number of ions required for generating a statistically significant isotope peak pattern of peptide ions. It is found that the low boundary of ionization efficiency is 1 – 2 % for Substance P. In addition, comparison of macro- and microspot sample deposition techniques for Substance P shows that under the experimental conditions used, a minimum of ∼ 5 analyte molecules per μm 2 are necessary to generate useful signals. Implications of these results on further mass spectrometric developments towards even more sensitive detection are discussed...|$|R
