A feature of GPS collar technology is the capability to program the dates of (sample period) and time between successive relocations (<b>sample</b> <b>interval).</b> I investigated the ef-fects of sampling regime, the combination of <b>sample</b> period and <b>interval,</b> on analyzing movements of female caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti) in the Fortymile Caribou Herd as a case study. Based on hourly relocations throughout the win-ter, caribou moved 260 meters per hour or 6. 2 kilometers per day. Sample period influenced estimates of movement rates, as I detected both diurnal and seasonal variability. Caribou movement rates during daylight and twilight hours were significantly greater than during the nighttime. Movement rates were greater during twilight hours than during daylight, but only slightly. Mid-winter and late winter movement rates were virtually the same, however, both were significantly less than during early winter. As <b>sample</b> <b>interval</b> increased, estimates of movement rates decreased sub-stantially. Estimates based on 2 -hour <b>sample</b> <b>intervals</b> were 14 % less than those based on one-hour <b>sample</b> <b>intervals,</b> with estimates declining to 65 % of the one-hour <b>sample</b> <b>interval</b> estimates at 167 -hour (weekly) intervals.

30|$|With a {{small sample}} rate (0.1, 1, 10 and 31.25), the system is light-loaded and every node can finish its {{transmission}} before a new sensor data arrives; thus, the PDR s and AL s remain stable.

A mathematically ideal way to interpolate the sequence {{involves the use of}} sinc functions. Each sample in the sequence is replaced by a sinc function, centered on the time axis at the original location of the sample, nT, with the amplitude of the sinc function scaled to the sample value, x. Subsequently, the sinc functions are summed into a continuous function. A mathematically equivalent method is to convolve one sinc function with a series of Dirac delta pulses, weighted by the sample values. Neither method is numerically practical. Instead, some type of approximation of the sinc functions, finite in length, is used. The imperfections attributable to the approximation are known as interpolation error.|$|E
