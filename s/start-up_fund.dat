40|$|Obtaining <b>start-up</b> <b>funding</b> for {{new product}} ideas in large {{corporations}} is inherently frustrating. We evaluated teams that {{were successful in}} obtaining <b>start-up</b> <b>funds</b> from large corporations to determine if their cognitive abilities were different from groups unable to obtain similar funding. We found that the funded teams were strongly correlated (R = 0. 19, p= 0. 00) {{with higher levels of}} self efficacy (i. e. one’s self belief that he or she can effectively and successfully pursue certain actions) and persuasion (i. e. the ability to sway the actions of other individuals).

5000|$|Arklu co-founders, {{based in}} London at the time, noticed {{a niche in}} the market, with parents {{concerned}} about the over-sexualization of dolls currently available in the market. They began 18-months of research, alongside British academics, resulting in Lottie; a doll based on the proportions of an average 9-year old girl (with the exception of her head). The research was gathered by leading British academics, Professor David McCarthy (Prof of Nutrition and Health - Institute for Health Research & Policy, London Metropolitan University) and Dr Margaret Ashwell OBE (formerly Science Director of the British Nutrition Foundation). Lottie is childlike and relatable; she doesn't wear jewellery, make-up or high heels - opting for raincoats, striped tights, dresses and wellington boots. Lottie can stand on her own two feet. Lottie was launched in August 2012, and Finn joined the collection in 2014. 2017 will see the introduction of Mia, Sammi and Sophia. [...] Arklu co-founder and Managing Director Ian Harkin decided to move from London to Letterkenny in County Donegal, close to Ian's hometown of Ballybofey in 2014. Donegal is commonly acknowledged as a blackspot for unemployment, and many young people are forced to move away to pursue careers.
