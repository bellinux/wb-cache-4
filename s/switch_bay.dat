5000|$|Each line {{switch in}} this first, mixed bay has nine lines on nine of its {{vertical}}s, the tenth vertical being reserved for test purposes. In {{addition to the}} 90 lines on these switches, each LLF {{has at least one}} simple line <b>switch</b> <b>bay,</b> with ten more line switches carrying 200 lines. Thus the minimum size of a LLF is 290 lines for a line concentration ratio of 2.9:1. Optionally it has still another frame, with ten more switches and another 200 lines, and so forth, up to a maximum line concentration ratio of 5.9:1 since they all shared the same hundred line links. The line circuit is much like that in 1XB with a line relay for alerting the exchange to a trip condition, and the vertical off-normal contacts of the switch vertical serving as cutoff relay.|$|E

50|$|The TLF having {{twice as}} many links, junctor switches, and junctors as the LLF, there are always {{twice as many}} LLFs as TLFs. As first designed, the maximum number was ten TLFs and twenty LLFs, known as 10x20, and at first rarely achieved. In the late 1950s {{multiple}} trunk junctor <b>switch</b> <b>bays</b> (ETL and SETL) were added to give each TLF access to more junctors. The first expanded version allowed each office to have 20x40, and in the 1960s the maximum reached 30x60. Development stopped at that point because the four-stage layout was becoming progressively less efficient at greater sizes, and because the 1ESS switch with eight stages was under development.|$|R

50|$|Each server {{comes with}} Ethernet NICs on the motherboard. These 'on board' NICs connect to a switch or {{pass-through}} module {{inserted in the}} A1 or the A2 bay {{at the back of}} the switch. To allow more NICs or non-Ethernet I/O each blade has two so-called mezzanine slots: slot B connecting to the switches/modules in bay B1 and B2 and slot C connecting to C1/C2: An M1000e chassis holds up to 6 switches or pass-through modules. For redundancy one would normally install switches in pairs: the <b>switch</b> in <b>bay</b> A2 is normally the same as the A1 switch and connects the blades on-motherboard NICs to connect to the data or storage network.|$|R

40|$|A {{significant}} increase in the distributed generating sources connected and planned for connection to medium voltage (MV) grids makes voltage criteria very important in assessing the sources’ connectivity. Many requests have been submitted for connection of distributed generation sources at a considerable distance (even a dozen or so kilometres) from a main supply substation’s MV buses. As a rule, these are requests for the interconnection deep in an existing MV bus, but also directly to MV <b>switching</b> substation <b>bays.</b> Then maintaining appropriate voltage levels becomes a basic technical problem. Another technical problem relates to meeting the power quality criteria. THD index, and the level of individual harmonics, significantly increases, in many cases reaching or even exceeding the boundary values. With their extensive experience, the authors present examples and results of some analyses herewith. They indicate the impact of voltage conditions on the connection possibilities of distributed generation to MV grids...|$|R

40|$|Estuaries {{regulate}} nitrogen (N) fluxes transported {{from land}} to the open ocean through uptake and denitrification. In Narragansett Bay, anthropogenic N loading has increased {{over the last century}} with evidence for eutrophication in some regions of Narragansett Bay. Increased concerns over eutrophication prompted upgrades at wastewater treatment facilities (WWTFs) to decrease the amount of nitrogen discharged. The upgrade to tertiary treatment – where bioavailable nitrogen is reduced and removed through denitrification – has occurred at multiple facilities throughout Narragansett Bay’s watershed. Nitrogen remains limiting to primary production in the Bay proper which led to speculation that primary production throughout the system may result in large part from the high nutrient loads in the north. Tracing N sources is essential for attributing drivers of primary production and it has previously been done using stable isotopes. However, little information on the isotopic composition of the nutrient inputs is available and no data are available {{to assess the impact of}} upgrades to tertiary treatment on the isotopic composition of dissolved inorganic nitrogen or primary producers. The objective of this dissertation is to explore the spatial and temporal distribution of the stable isotopes of nitrogen in multiple forms, inorganic and organic, the impact of upgrades at the wastewater treatment facilities on nutrient fluxes and their isotopic compositions, and the role anthropogenic N plays in driving primary production within Narragansett Bay. Samples were collected from 2007 through 2012, before and during upgrades to tertiary treatment. Samples from rivers and WWTFs were collected to characterize the potential impact of upgrades and anthropogenic source nitrate (NO 3 -) isotopic variability. Surface water NO 3 - samples were collected from a north-south transect to trace the impact of the upgrades spatially. Finally, during the summers of 2011 and 2012, additional samples of subsurface nitrate, chlorophyll a, and macroalgae (2012 only) were collected to assess the relative importance of anthropogenic nitrogen to primary producers. All water samples were analyzed for nutrient concentrations (NO 3 -, PO 43 -, NH 4 +) and stable nitrogen (δ 15 N) and oxygen (δ 18 O) isotopic compositions of NO 3 -. Chlorophyll a content and the compound specific and bulk N isotopic composition of chlorophyll a and macroaglae, respectively, were measured. Between 2009 and 2012, upgrades to tertiary treatment reduced nitrogen inputs to Narragansett Bay by 30 % but the impacts on regional concentrations were minimal. During that same time period, overall nitrate concentrations in surface water maintained a decreasing gradient downstream toward the ocean, and summer subsurface nitrate concentrations remain relatively static throughout the bay. Estimates of nitrogen availability relative to phosphate (N*) suggest that the <b>bay</b> <b>switches</b> from having excess N to exhibiting a deficit relative to what phytoplankton require at 41. 7 °N (the boundary between the Providence River Estuary and Narragansett Bay), regardless of N inputs upstream. On the other hand, a significant shift in the isotopic composition of the sources was observed. Tertiary treatment at one WWTF increased effluent nitrate δ 15 N and δ 18 O values by ~ 16 ‰ for both isotopes, and increased rivers by 4 ‰. North of 41. 7 °N (the Providence River Estuary) δ 15 N values increased significantly by 2 ‰, but not south of this point (Narragansett Bay proper). The increase in δ 15 N is attributed to the increased δ 15 N from upgrades to tertiary treatment. During the summers of 2011 and 2012, the subsurface δ 15 N-NO 3 - and δ 15 N-chlorophyll a peaked mid-bay while macroalgal δ 15 N decreased linearly throughout the bay. The differences between the δ 15 N of macroalgae and chlorophyll a imply multiple sources of nitrogen supporting primary production. Phytoplankton are transported vertically and horizontally by tides/currents and mixing events. The exact position where they incorporate N is unknown, but they appear to be supported by subsurface nitrate. This runs counter to the idea that phytoplankton harvest nutrients upstream and are carried into the Bay by advection. Macroalgae are incorporating N at a fixed position, and may be supported by small, but consistent, benthic fluxes. In conclusion, the river and WWTF data suggest that when seasonal means are significantly different from other sources, δ 15 N-NO 3 - may be a useful tracer of inputs in the nutrient replete region of the Providence River Estuary. Beyond the Providence River Estuary, we find that anthropogenically-derived nitrate is mixed with offshore water and/or is recycled quite efficiently, overprinting any anthropogenic tracer signal. Primary producers rely on anthropogenic nutrients within the Providence River Estuary, but also derive nitrogen from vertical mixing and benthic nutrient dynamics within the bay proper. In the future, it is likely that anthropogenic N input reductions will continue to impact north of 41. 7 °N while mixing and recycling will dominate processes south of this point...|$|R
