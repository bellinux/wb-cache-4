5|$|The {{classical}} {{version of}} the Nazarov cyclization suffers from several drawbacks which modern variants attempt to circumvent.

40|$|In {{the retina}} of {{trichromatic}} primates, chromatic information is encoded in an opponent fashion and {{transmitted to the}} lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and visual cortex via parallel pathways. Chromatic <b>selectivities</b> of neurons in the LGN form two separate clusters, corresponding to two classes of cone opponency. In the visual cortex, however, the chromatic <b>selectivities</b> are more distributed, which is in accordance with a population code for colour. Previous studies of cone signals in natural scenes typically found opponent codes with chromatic <b>selectivities</b> corresponding to two directions in colour space. Here we investigated how the nonlinear spatiochromatic filtering in the retina influences the encoding of colour signals. Cone signals were derived from hyperspectral images of natural scenes and pre-processed by centre-surround filtering and rectification, resulting in parallel ON and OFF channels. Independent Component Analysis on these signals yielded a highly sparse code with basis functions that showed spatio-chromatic <b>selectivities.</b> In contrast to previous analyses of linear transformations of cone signals, chromatic <b>selectivities</b> were not restricted to two main chromatic axes, but were more continuously distributed in colour space, similar to the population code of colour in the early visual cortex. Our results indicate that spatiochromatic processing in the retina leads to a more distributed and more efficient code for natural scenes...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop {{catalysts}} for conversion of synthesis gas (H₂ and CO) to higher alcohols, primarily ethanol and propanol. Crude oil is consumed at a rate of more than 20 million barrels a day in the United States, mainly for producing fuels and chemical feedstocks. However, the total amount of crude oil is limited, and alternative ways of producing alcohols as precursors for chemical feedstocks are desirable. In this study, using a known K/MoS₂/metal oxide catalyst as the starting point, two different approaches were explored to improve catalytic properties: 1) Co promotion on K/MoS₂/mixed metal oxide (MMO) catalysts, and 2) Preparation of K/MoS₂/metal oxide catalysts with molybdenum carbide as a precursor, instead of molybdenum oxide. With respect to Co promotion on K/MoS₂/MMO catalysts, the effect of varying the Co content in the K/Mo-Co/MMO catalysts prepared by a co-impregnation method did not produce significant changes in catalytic acitivities or <b>selectivities.</b> It was due to the premature precipitation of cobalt molybdate during synthesis. Cobalt molybdate precipitation can generally be prevented by using water as a solvent, but this approach is not appropriate for this study because of the use of hydrotalcite-derived mixed metal oxide as the support. Co loadings on K/Mo/MMO-Co catalysts did not change <b>selectivities</b> significantly, either. However, they changed catalytic activities, represented by gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) required to obtain 8 % conversion while maintaining high <b>selectivities</b> for higher alcohols. As a result, C ₂₊ alcohol productivities reached 0. 01 g(alcohol) /g(catalyst) /hr with Co loadings higher than 8 %. With respect to using Mo 2 C as the precursor of Mo species instead of MoO 3, comparisons between catalysts with different precursors for Mo species and different pretreatments were investigated. In this study, both K/Mo catalysts supported on MgO and α-Al₂O₃ showed similar tendencies of catalytic activities and <b>selectivities.</b> The highest C₂₊ alcohol <b>selectivities</b> and productivities were obtained on presulfided MoO₃ catalysts on both supports.

25|$|After {{the release}} of propranolol, {{relative}} lipophilicity of β-blockers as {{a significant factor in}} their varied and complex pharmacology, became an important factor. It was suspected that propranolol's centrally induced side effects could be due to its high lipophilicity. Thus, it was focused on synthesizing analogues with hydrophilic moieties, favourably placed to see if the side effects would decrease. Selecting para-acylamino groups as the hydrophilic moiety, scientists synthesized a group of para-acylphenoxyethanol and propanolamines, and selected practolol for clinical trials. Practolol had one property not previously seen with β-blockers, it exhibited cardioselectivity (β1 <b>selectivity).</b> Studies from practolol showed that moving the acylamino group to meta or ortho positions, on the benzene ring, caused a loss of <b>selectivity</b> but not loss of the β-blockade itself.

40|$|The recent {{development}} of a high-aspect ratio Si etch (HARSE) process has enabled the fabrication {{of a variety of}} Si structures where deep trench etching is necessary.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the effect of}} the pore dimension of zeolites on the separation of gas mixtures using atomistic simulation methods. We studied two categories of the zeolites with small pores: pore modified silicalite for H₂/CH₄separation and small pore silica zeolites for CO₂/CH₄separation. The effect of pore modification of silicalite on the H₂/CH₄separation was examined. Under some degrees of surface modification, the CH₄flux was reduced much more than the H₂flux, resulting in high ideal <b>selectivities.</b> The use of small pore zeolites for CO₂/CH₄separations was studied. In DDR, we showed that CO₂diffusion rates are only weakly affected by the presence of CH₄, even though the latter molecules diffuse very slowly. Consequently, therefore, the permeance of CO₂in the equimolar mixtures is similar to the permeance for pure CO₂, while the CH₄permeance in the mixture is greatly reduced relatively to the pure component permeance. The calculated CO₂/CH₄separation <b>selectivities</b> are higher than 100 {{for a wide range of}} feed pressure, indicating excellent separation capabilities of DDR based membranes. Inspired by the observation in DDR we also {{examined the}} separation capabilities of 10 additional pure silica small pore zeolites for CO₂/CH₄separations. From these considerations, we predict that SAS, MTF and RWR will exhibit high separation <b>selectivities</b> because of their very high adsorption <b>selectivities</b> for CO₂over CH₄. CHA and IHW, which have similar pore structures to DDR, showed comparable separation <b>selectivities</b> to DDR because of large differences in the diffusion rates of CO₂and CH₄. Ph. D.
