40|$|Machining of copper-based alloys {{tends to}} produce irregularly spaced chip serration. However, turning {{cold-rolled}} material could sometimes produce regularly spaced chip serration. The regularly spaced chip serration is indeed layers of <b>shear</b> <b>bands</b> that grow and agglomerate to become chip serration. In this paper, {{an investigation into}} the formation of <b>shear</b> <b>bands</b> in the microcutting process of single point diamond turning is presented. The experimental results reveal how <b>shear</b> <b>bands</b> are initiated at the free edge of the chip and then propagated towards the tool tip. A new finite element model is developed to simulate the initiation and formation of these <b>shear</b> <b>bands</b> and to provide evidence for how these <b>shear</b> <b>bands</b> are induced by the elastic strain concentration. In contrast to the popular assumption that materials behave as rigid plastic during machining, the results reveal that elastic strain is one of the dominant factors leading to the formation of <b>shear</b> <b>bands.</b> Finally, an analytical model is proposed to reveal the influence of <b>shear</b> <b>bands</b> on the cutting force and on the formation of serrated chips.

It {{has been well}} known that plastic {{deformation}} of bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) is localised in thin <b>shear</b> <b>bands.</b> So, initiation of <b>shear</b> <b>bands</b> and related deformation should be studied for comprehensive understanding of deformation mechanisms of BMGs. In this paper, indentation techniques are extensively used to characterise elastic deformation of Zr-Cu-based metallic glass, followed by a systematic analysis of initiation and evolution of <b>shear</b> <b>bands</b> in the indented materials.

5000|$|Adiabatic <b>shear</b> <b>band</b> is a {{term used}} in physics, {{mechanics}} and engineering. Since the 1960s adiabatic shear bands have been studied extensively because of their importance as a failure mode {{in areas such as}} metal forming and cutting, various types of ballistic impact, as well as vehicle crashes. An adiabatic <b>shear</b> <b>band</b> {{is one of the many}} mechanisms of failure that occur in metals and other materials that are deformed at a high rate in processes such as metal forming, machining and ballistic impact. Adiabatic shear bands are usually very narrow, typically 5-500 μm and they consist of very highly sheared material."Adiabatic" [...] is a thermodynamic term meaning an absence of heat transfer - the heat produced is retained in the zone where it is created. (The opposite extreme, where all heat that is produced is conducted away, is [...] "isothermal".) ...|$|E
50|$|Closed-form {{solutions}} disclosing the <b>shear</b> <b>band</b> emergence can {{be obtained}} through the perturbative approach, consisting in the superimposition of a perturbation field upon an unperturbed deformed state.In particular, an infinite, incompressible, nonlinear elastic material, homogeneously deformed under the plane strain condition can be perturbed through superposition of concentrated forces or {{by the presence of}} cracks or rigid line inclusions.|$|E

The growth of dendrite is simulated based on Elder’s solidification theory. The {{interactions between the}} <b>shear</b> <b>bands</b> and the dendrites are studied using the phase-field model for <b>shear</b> <b>banding</b> in BMGs. It is found that the properties of dendrites such as the rotation angle representing their dispersion patterns and their fracture energy significantly affect the branching, multiplication and detour of <b>shear</b> <b>bands,</b> which result in the improved ductility of the composites. The simulation evaluates quantitatively the properties of dendrites that determine the features of <b>shear</b> <b>banding</b> in the composites. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
30|$|Strain {{localization}} phenomena {{are observed}} in various materials as narrow zones of intense shearing, known as <b>shear</b> <b>bands.</b> In many cases, {{the formation of}} <b>shear</b> <b>bands</b> {{is accompanied by a}} softening response, characterized by a decrease in strength of the material with accumulated inelastic strain, often leading to complete failure [1],[2]. Therefore, research on formation of <b>shear</b> <b>bands</b> has received much attention.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Plane strain {{tests were}} {{performed}} on seven kaolinite blocks, each of which developed <b>shear</b> <b>bands.</b> Anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) analysis of the kaolinite reveals a threshold degree of magnetic anisotropy (P 0) exceeding which <b>shear</b> <b>bands</b> develop. Since P 0 is a strain-intensity gauge and soils are known to develop <b>shear</b> <b>bands</b> prior to landsliding, it is concluded that soil in every landslide-prone region must have its unique threshold P 0 exceeding which it develops <b>shear</b> <b>bands</b> before failing. Therefore, AMS monitoring of soil in landslide prone regions is proposed as a potential tool {{in the management of}} natural hazard zones...|$|R
50|$|Different {{theories}} {{describe how}} a dispersed rubber phase toughens a polymeric substance; most employ methods of dissipating energy throughout the matrix. These theories include: microcrack theory, shear-yielding theory, multiple-crazing theory, <b>shear</b> <b>band</b> and crazing interaction theory, {{and more recently}} those including the effects of critical ligament thickness, critical plastic area, voiding and cavitation, damage competition and others.|$|E
50|$|In {{amorphous}} {{materials such}} as polymers, amorphous ceramics (glass), and amorphous metals, the lack of long range order leads to yielding via mechanisms such as brittle fracture, crazing, and <b>shear</b> <b>band</b> formation.

50|$|<b>Shear</b> <b>band</b> {{formation}} {{is an example}} of a material instability, corresponding to an abrupt loss of homogeneity of deformation occurring in a solid sample subject to a loading path compatible with continued uniform deformation. In this sense, it may be interpreted as a deformation mechanism ‘alternative’ to a trivial one and therefore a bifurcation or loss of uniqueness of a ‘perfect’ equilibrium path. The distinctive character of this bifurcation is that it may occur even in an infinite body (or under the extreme constraint of smooth contact with a rigid constraint).|$|E
40|$|Using a micro {{particle}} imaging velocity technique, we resolve for {{the first}} time the three dimensionnal structure of wormlike <b>shear</b> <b>banding</b> flows in straight microchannels. The study revealed two effects, which should be generic for <b>shear</b> <b>banding</b> flows: the first is a strong amplification of the confinement induced by the edge of the channel, the second is an instability of the interface between the <b>shear</b> <b>bands.</b> A detailed quantitative comparison of our experimental measurements with a theoretical study of the diffusive Johnson Segalman model leads to excellent agreement. Our study clarifies the nature of <b>shear</b> <b>banding</b> flow instabilities, and shows that, despite the challenging complexity of the situation and the uncertainty regarding their molecular structure, <b>shear</b> <b>banding</b> flows in confined geometries are amenable to quantitative modelling, a feature that opens pathways to their practical utilization...|$|R
40|$|Edge {{fracture}} occurs {{frequently in}} non-Newtonian fluids. A similar instability {{has often been}} reported at the free surface of fluids undergoing <b>shear</b> <b>banding</b> and leads to expulsion of the sample. In this paper, the distortion of the free surface of such a <b>shear</b> <b>banding</b> fluid is calculated by balancing the surface tension against the second normal stresses induced in the two <b>shear</b> <b>bands,</b> and simultaneously requiring a continuous and smooth meniscus. We show that wormlike micelles typically retain meniscus integrity when <b>shear</b> <b>banding,</b> {{but in some cases}} can lose integrity for a range of average applied shear rates during which one expects <b>shear</b> <b>banding.</b> This meniscus fracture would lead to ejection of the sample as the <b>shear</b> <b>banding</b> region is swept through. We further show that entangled polymer solutions are expected to display a propensity for fracture because of their much larger second normal stresses. These calculations are consistent with available data in the literature. We also estimate the meniscus distortion of a three-band configuration, as has been observed in some wormlike micellar solutions in a cone and plate geometry...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering. Segmented {{chips that}} arise {{as a result}} of {{formation}} of adiabatic <b>shear</b> <b>bands</b> are common in high-speed machining of harder alloys. Analytical models describing the mechanics of segmented chip formation have been developed, and these models do not assume or require failure in the material. Most of the finite element (FE) studies of segmented chip formation in the literature always include failure in the material. This thesis presents a numerical study of the occurrence of adiabatic <b>shear</b> <b>banding</b> without material failure. Here, the mechanical properties of hardened 4340 steel was used as a base line, and Johnson and Cook material model for this material were modified to make the material more prone to <b>shear</b> <b>banding.</b> Simulations were performed in two different commercial FE packages: ABAQUS/Explicit and LS-DYNA. The arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) approach in ABAQUS/Explicit showed <b>shear</b> <b>banding</b> when mass scaling factor was 100. The same simulation did not show <b>shear</b> <b>banding</b> once the mass scaling was removed. Also, the simulations with accelerated thermal softening kept crashing; likely due to the onset of <b>shear</b> <b>banding</b> causing too much mesh distortion. Since steady state was not achieved with any of these simulations, it is hard to say exactly how the intensity of <b>shear</b> <b>banding</b> changes with material properties. Finite element studies in the recent literature, where researchers have shown <b>shear</b> <b>banding</b> through strain softening without material failure using the updated Lagrangian approach, were repeated with ALE in ABAQUS. With the reduction in the parameter controlling the curvature based mesh refinement, <b>shear</b> <b>banding</b> has been successfully simulated in ABAQUS. ALE approach in ABAQUS did not produce the same chip geometry shown in literature because the simulations failed since the mesh was not able to reform to vii a large extent and produce concave shapes as we see in serrated chips. Mass scaling with a factor of 100 did not affect the result. It {{should be noted that the}} strain seems to diffuse with the increase in the element size. So, smaller elements are needed to better capture the strains along the PSZ. Lagrangian analysis with a parting-layer approach in LS-DYNA showed <b>shear</b> <b>banding</b> for different plastic properties of the material and no <b>shear</b> <b>banding</b> for others. Observations of the effect of different material and mesh parameters on the <b>shear</b> <b>banding</b> intensity have been made from the simulations and future research are proposed...|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the main}} {{differences}} between crazing and shear banding, another form of stress deformation, is that crazing occurs {{with an increase in}} volume, which shear banding does not. This means that under compression, many of these brittle, amorphous polymers will <b>shear</b> <b>band</b> rather than craze, as there is a contraction of volume instead of an increase. In addition, when crazing occurs, one will typically not observe [...] "necking," [...] or concentration of force upon one spot in a material. Rather, crazing will occur homogeneously throughout the material.|$|E
50|$|In some {{materials}} such as metals, plastics, or granular materials like sand or soils, the shearing motion rapidly localizes into a narrow band, known as a <b>shear</b> <b>band.</b> In that case, all the sliding occurs within the band while the blocks of material {{on either side of}} the band simply slide past one another without internal deformation. A special case of shear localization occurs in brittle materials when they fracture along a narrow band. Then, all subsequent shearing occurs within the fracture. Plate tectonics, where the plates of the Earth's crust slide along fracture zones, is an example of this.|$|E
50|$|A <b>shear</b> <b>band</b> (or, more generally, a 'strain localization') is {{a narrow}} zone of intense {{shearing}} strain, usually of plastic nature, developing during severe deformation of ductile materials.As an example, a soil (overconsolidated silty-clay) specimen {{is shown in}} Fig. 1, after an axialsymmetric compression test. Initially the sample was cylindrical in shape and, since symmetry was tried to be preserved during the test, the cylindrical shape was maintained for a while during the test and the deformation was homogeneous, but at extreme loading two X-shaped shear bands had formed and the subsequent deformation was strongly localized (see also the sketch {{on the right of}} Fig. 1).|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{formation}} of adiabatic <b>shear</b> <b>bands,</b> which are narrow deformation bands with intense strains, in copper at high strain rates {{has long been}} questioned due to ductility of copper {{and its ability to}} exhibit uniform deformation at relatively large strains. However, in some instances when copper is tested in torsion at shear strain in excess of 103  s− 1, it has been reported to develop adiabatic <b>shear</b> <b>bands.</b> This study examines the occurrence of adiabatic <b>shear</b> <b>bands</b> in torsion specimens of commercial pure copper (99. 94 % Cu) {{as a function of the}} initial torque and angle of twist. Adiabatic <b>shear</b> <b>bands</b> (ASBs) were observed using scanning electron microscopy. It is concluded that a mesomechanical property such as adiabatic <b>shear</b> <b>bands</b> can be induced in ductile materials such as polycrystalline copper. The source of these bands is correlated to the extensive shear deformation before fracture...|$|R
5000|$|The {{state-of-the-art}} of {{the research}} on shear bands is that the phenomenon is well understood from the theoretical [...] and experimental [...] point of view and available constitutive models give nice qualitative predictions, although quantitative predictions are often poor. Moreover, great progresses have been made on numerical simulations, so that <b>shear</b> <b>band</b> nucleation and propagation in relatively complex situations can be traced numerically with finite element models, although still at the cost of a great computational effort. Of further interest are simulations that reveal the crystallographic orientation dependence of shear banding in single crystal and polycrystals. These simulations show that certain orientations are much more prone to undergo shear localization than others.|$|E
5000|$|Increasing the {{bulkiness}} of the {{monomer unit}} via incorporation of aryl rings is another strengthening mechanism. The anisotropy of the molecular structure means that these mechanisms are {{heavily dependent on}} the direction of applied stress. While aryl rings drastically increase rigidity along {{the direction of the}} chain, these materials may still be brittle in perpendicular directions. Macroscopic structure can be adjusted to compensate for this anisotropy. For example, the high strength of Kevlar arises from a stacked multilayer macrostructure where aromatic polymer layers are rotated with respect to their neighbors. When loaded oblique to the chain direction, ductile polymers with flexible linkages, such as oriented polyethylene, are highly prone to <b>shear</b> <b>band</b> formation, so macroscopic structures which place the load parallel to the draw direction would increase strength.|$|E
50|$|The energy-balancing model {{applies the}} {{physical}} {{properties of the}} whole material to describe the microscopic behavior during triaxial stress. The volume stress and particle radius conditions for cavitation can be calculated, giving the theoretical minimum particle radius for cavitation, useful for practical applications in rubber toughening.Typically cavitation will occur when the average stress on the rubber particles is between 10 and 20 megapascal. The volume strain on the particle is relieved and voiding occurs. The energy absorption due to this increase in volume is theoretically negligible. Instead, it is the consequent <b>shear</b> <b>band</b> formation that accounts for increased toughness. Before debonding, as the strain increases, the rubber phases is forced to stretch further strengthening the matrix. Debonding between the matrix and the rubber reduces the toughness, creating the need for strong adhesion between the polymer and rubber phases.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{monitored}} resonant {{behavior of}} fatigue specimens of metastable {{austenitic stainless steel}} (AISI 304) is correlated with its damage accumulation in the very high cycle fatigue (VHCF) regime. The resonant behavior is studied experimentally and shows a distinct transient characteristic. Microscopic examinations indicate that during VHCF a localized plastic deformation in <b>shear</b> <b>bands</b> arises on the specimen surface. Hence, this work focuses {{on the effect of}} damage accumulation in <b>shear</b> <b>bands</b> on the resonant behavior of AISI 304 in the VHCF regime. A microstructural simulation model is proposed that takes into account specific mechanisms in <b>shear</b> <b>bands</b> proven by experimental results. The simulation model is solved numerically using the two-dimensional boundary element method and the resonant behavior is characterized by evaluating the force-displacement hysteresis loop. Simulation of <b>shear</b> <b>bands</b> agrees well with microscopic examinations and plastic deformation in <b>shear</b> <b>bands</b> influences the transient characteristic of the resonant behavior...|$|R
30|$|Nonetheless, {{a stress}} plateau can {{be due to}} other causes rather than <b>shear</b> <b>banding</b> when {{interpreting}} solely shear rate rheological measurements, for instance wall and stick slip, elastic instabilities, geometry, uncertainty from stress measurements, and inherent stress gradient from the device can cause similar responses (Hu et al. 2008). According to Manneville (2008), a plateau in shear stress provides insufficient evidence of the <b>shear</b> <b>banding</b> presence since the Couette geometry only measures global measurements and <b>shear</b> <b>banding</b> requires more localized characterization tools to allow the organization and microstructure of the bands (Manneville 2008). Further investigation is required to confirm the presence of <b>shear</b> <b>banding</b> at {{a wider range of}} shear rates (10 − 2 to 1000  s− 1).|$|R
40|$|Geometric {{analyses}} of three mylonite zones, including two metamorphic-core-complex SC-mylonite zones, {{show that the}} mylonitic foliation surfaces (S-surfaces) are consistently discordant to {{the margins of the}} shear zones. Finite-strain analyses show that the foliation surfaces in each zone are consistently oriented parallel to the XY-plane of the finite strain ellipsoid. The <b>shear</b> <b>bands</b> within the mylonites (C-surfaces, C'-surfaces, extensional crenulations, and shear-band cleavages) are uniformly oriented subparallel to the margins of the shear zones. The finite lengths and discontinuous natures of the <b>shear</b> <b>bands</b> require that the displacement along them be accommodated by the S-surfaces at the tips of the <b>shear</b> <b>bands.</b> Thus the S-surface elongations and orientations represent the total bulk rock strain, rather than some minimum measure of inter-C-surface strain. General stress and strain considerations indicate that the <b>shear</b> <b>bands</b> are planes of maximum shear stress, and that they are not only simple-shear slip planes. This interpretation implies that in simple-shear deformation, a single, irrotational set of <b>shear</b> <b>bands</b> will develop parallel to the shear-zone boundaries. In deformations involving significant components of coaxial strain, however, <b>shear</b> <b>bands</b> may develop in other orientations or in conjugate sets and rotate with progressive deformation...|$|R
