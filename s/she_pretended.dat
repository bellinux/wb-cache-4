5|$|At {{the reunification}} summit, the {{president}} personally requested Hyun-jun {{to be at}} his side. Concurrently, NSS agents realized they've been duped: the presumed dead IRIS agents at the mall crisis was actually the hostages. The true IRIS agents escaped and infiltrated the summit to kill all delegates. IRIS agents killed and replaced various security agents for a massacre. Unfortunately, it failed with Seung-hee's interference. <b>She</b> <b>pretended</b> to be an IRIS agent and used the confusion to stop them. This created mass panic as IRIS agents make their stand against all security forces. Ultimately, the SK president and NK forces survived the assault and Hyun-jun saved the day again.|$|E

At first <b>she</b> <b>pretended</b> that her swelling {{was the result of}} a tumor. When the time came to deliver, she claimed she had contracted chicken pox for which she had to be quarantined. Her illegitimate son, Alexis Louis de Wenden, was born in Nice on 23 December 1902. The name de Wenden was granted by King Christian IX of Denmark after Anastasia's villa. She did bring up her illegitimate son herself. When later he was sent to study in a boarding school in Normandy, she wrote to him every day.|$|E
25|$|Lozada and {{her partner}} split up while chasing the suspect. She chased him to a nearby {{abandoned}} lot located {{at the intersection of}} Central Avenue and Chauncey Street and waited at the lot which was heavily weeded and was loaded with junk. When confronted by the suspect <b>she</b> <b>pretended</b> to be looking for a lost dog with the intention that the suspect would not suspect her real motives. The suspect then turned around to look for the dog and Lozada pulled out her service gun. As Lozada attempted to handcuff the suspect, he turned and took her gun. According to Jeter, Lozada pleaded for her life to no avail. The suspect then shot her twice in the face. The first time Jeter fired, the bullet passed through her cheek. He then walked a short distance only to return after a few moments to shoot her in the face, killing her. Lozada's body was found three hours later in the lot; she was the first female officer to be killed {{in the line of duty}} in New York City.|$|E

25|$|In {{the battle}} of Valdivia she {{received}} the rank of second lieutenant. In the next battle of Puren her captain died and she took command, winning the battle. However, due to the many complaints that existed against her for her cruelty against the Indians, she was not promoted to the next military rank. This frustration led to a period devoted to vandalizing, killing {{as many people as}} she met on the road, causing extensive damage and burning entire crops. In Conception she assassinated the chief auditor of the city, for which she was locked in a church for six months. After being released, she killed her brother Don Miguel de Erausco in another duel and was again imprisoned eight months. She later fled to Argentina across the Andes, through a difficult transition path. She was saved at the brink of death by a villager and taken to Tucumán, where she promised marriage to two young women, the daughter of an Indian widow (which had hosted Catalina on his farm during her convalescence) and the niece of a canon. She ended up fleeing from there without marrying any of them, but kept the money and clothing from Holland, given by the niece of the canon as a sign of love. Then she went to Potosí, where she became the assistant to a sergeant, and returned again to fight against the Indians, participating in mass killings in Chuncos. In la Plata (Chuquisaca) she was accused of a crime she did not commit, she was tortured and finally set free again (without revealing her identity). Once out of prison, she devoted herself to smuggle wheat and cattle on the orders of Juan Lopez de Arquijo. A new lawsuit forced her to take refuge in a church. In Piscobamba, by quarreling, she killed another individual. This time she was sentenced to death, but was saved at the last minute by the deposition of another prisoner sentenced to death. Then she remained in a holy asylum for five months in a church due to a duel with a jealous husband. When she moved to La Paz, she was sentenced again to death for another offense. To escape, <b>she</b> <b>pretended</b> to confess and, after seizing a consecrated host fled to Cuzco and returned to Peru.|$|E
500|$|Francesco Sisci, Asia {{editor of}} La Stampa, {{supported}} {{the possibility that}} the self-immolators were Falun Gong practitioners, writing in the Asia Times that [...] "no one believed that the government could have paid a mother to torch herself and her daughter, or that she was so loyal to the Communist Party that <b>she</b> <b>pretended</b> to be a Falungong member and kill herself and her only daughter, even if Falungong master Li Hongzhi forbade suicide..." [...] In Sisci's view, Chinese officials made a mistake by arresting foreign journalists on Tiananmen —"independently filmed news footage of the proceedings could have been the best proof of Falungong madness. Instead, when the government reported the episode, it looked like propaganda." ...|$|E

Filmed in early 2007, {{it was one of}} the videos shot in two weeks for the B'Day Anthology Video Album (2007) and was one out of eight previously unseen clips. [...] "Green Light" [...] was the third video shot during the sessions. The clip was inspired mainly by Robert Palmer's 1985 music video [...] "Addicted to Love" [...] with its [...] "stone-faced models pretending to play guitars". [...] "Green Light" [...] was considered by Beyoncé as a modern version of the video because they used the instruments as props, where <b>she</b> <b>pretended</b> as a rock star.|$|E

500|$|... "Teardrops on My Guitar" [...] {{is a song}} by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. The {{song was}} co-written by Swift, {{alongside}} Liz Rose and produced by Nathan Chapman with Swift's aid. [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar" [...] was released on February 19, 2007 by Big Machine Records, as the second single from Swift's eponymous debut album (2006). The song was later included on the international release of Swift's second studio album, Fearless (2008), and released as the second pop single from the album in the United Kingdom. It was inspired by Swift's experience with Drew Hardwick, a classmate of hers for whom she had feelings. He was completely unaware and continually spoke about his girlfriend to Swift, something <b>she</b> <b>pretended</b> to be endeared by. Years afterwards, Hardwick appeared at Swift's house, but Swift rejected him. Musically, the track is soft and is primarily guided by a gentle acoustic guitar. Critics have queried the song's classification as country music, with those in agreement (such as Grady Smith of Rolling Stone) citing the themes and narrative style as country-influenced and those opposed (such as Roger Holland of PopMatters) indicating the pop music production and instrumentation lack traditional country elements.|$|E
500|$|Cyrus {{has become}} known for her {{controversial}} performances, most notably during her Bangerz Tour (2014) and Milky Milky Milk Tour (2015). Her performance of [...] "Party In the U.S.A." [...] at the 2009 Teen Choice Awards sparked a [...] "national uproar" [...] because of her outfit and her perceived pole dancing. She faced similar controversy following a performance of [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] (2010) on Britain's Got Talent, where <b>she</b> <b>pretended</b> to kiss one of her female dancers on stage. Cyrus defended the performance, feeling she did nothing wrong. Cyrus {{was the subject of}} public and media scrutiny following her performance of [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] (2013) and [...] "Blurred Lines" [...] (2013) with Robin Thicke at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. Clad in a skin colored latex two-piece, Cyrus touched Thicke's crotch area with a giant foam finger and twerked against his crotch. Shortly thereafter, the word [...] "twerk" [...] was added to the online version of the Oxford Dictionary of English. The performance resulted in a media frenzy; one reviewer likened the performance to a [...] "bad acid trip", while another described it as a [...] "trainwreck in the classic sense of the word as the audience reaction seemed to be a mix of confusion, dismay and horror in a cocktail of embarrassment". Cyrus entered the stage of her Bangerz Tour (2014) by sliding down a slide {{in the shape of a}} tongue, gaining media attention during the tour for her costumes and racy performances.|$|E

2500|$|In 1973, {{while working}} in Redondo Beach, California, Evans met {{and fell in love}} with Nenette Zazzara, despite his {{long-term}} relationship with Ellaine. When Evans broke the news to Ellaine, <b>she</b> <b>pretended</b> to understand, but then committed suicide by throwing herself under a subway train. Evans' relatives believe that Ellaine's infertility, coupled with Bill's desire to have a son, may have influenced those events. As a result, Evans went back on heroin for a while, then got into a methadone treatment program. In August 1973, Evans married Nenette, and, in 1975, they had a child, Evan. The new family, which also included Evans' stepdaughter Maxine, lived in a large house in Closter, New Jersey. [...] Both remained very close until his death.

In July 2010, five women from West Hartford attacked her wrestling career, saying WWE encouraged profane and violent treatment of women. The McMahon campaign dismissed their group, Mothers Opposing McMahon, as a group of Democratic operatives, arguing that their press conference was organized and paid for by the Connecticut Democratic Party. Nonetheless, McMahon's campaign continued to fend off attacks, such as the Tom Cole affair and when <b>she</b> <b>pretended</b> to kick Jim Ross before firing him as part of a WWE storyline.|$|E

2500|$|During the trial, Mark Scarfo {{attempted}} suicide on November 1, 1988. Mark, then only 17 years old, had been taunted for years by classmates about his father's criminal activities. Increasingly despondent over his father's possible imprisonment, Mark Scarfo hanged {{himself in the}} office of his father's concrete supply company in Atlantic City. He was discovered by his mother, and paramedics were able to resuscitate him. He suffered cardiac arrest and his brain was deprived of oxygen. He entered a coma where he remained until his death in April 2014. [...] On November 4, 1988, just three days after Mark's suicide attempt, Nicky Scarfo Jr. and a friend assaulted a woman in an elevator at Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia. The woman said the two men had looked menacingly at her, and <b>she</b> <b>pretended</b> to reach for a gun in her coat. The two men then punched her, pushed her to the floor, and kicked her several times. Scarfo was arrested for assault, convicted, fined, and put on probation for the incident.|$|E
2500|$|The {{two main}} characters, [...] "Guy et Sylvie", are {{named after the}} actors who play them. Guy likes to tease Sylvie {{on a variety of}} subjects, and hates her mother. His father is {{remarried}} to a young, good-looking stripper, Mélanie, played by Mahée Paiement, and had a child with her. The attention the child receives makes Guy jealous, his father having spent little time with him when he was a child. Unlike Guy, Sylvie dreams of having a baby. She is jealous of Geneviève, Guy's sexy, and promiscuous, office colleague with whom he had a one-time affair years ago. She is also obsessed with cleanliness and resents Guy for being untidy. A curious running gag from the show involves Guy surprising Sylvie by grabbing her breasts from behind while shouting [...] "Road Runner!", followed by the cartoon character's emblematic honking [...] "beeb beeb" [...] sound. While she ostensibly loves it, <b>she</b> <b>pretended</b> the exact opposite when it was obliquely brought up by Guy in front of her mother. This joke was developed on the set by the two actors. The last season saw notable developments: a marriage, and a trip to Vietnam to adopt a little girl.|$|E
2500|$|Harold Fox (Gavin Richards) (Series 5–7) General Manager – Fox was {{the general}} manager of all the Maplins holiday camps, usually {{referred}} to as [...] "The Smiling Viper", [...] "Joe Maplin's Hatchet-man" [...] or, in Yvonne's words, [...] "A nasty, common, jumped-up, slimey, little toad". He owned a Jaguar which was chauffeur-driven and he was feared by most of the staff. He believed his power would win him favour with the opposite sex, but in truth most women despised him. He visited the camp on several occasions representing Joe Maplin. On one occasion, Peggy asked him permission to become a Yellowcoat, although he turned her down. Ted visited Fox at Head Office in London {{at the start of the}} 1960 season, believing he was going to be given the job as entertainment manager following Jeffrey Fairbrother's departure. In truth, Fox had simply called Ted in to give him an outstanding tax bill, and to inform him that Clive Dempster had been given the entertainment manager's job. During one of his visits to Crimpton-on-Sea, he took Gladys out to dinner at Tony's Trattoria, but <b>she</b> <b>pretended</b> to be ill and left halfway through so she could go on a date with Clive.|$|E
