40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to discuss the role, {{effectiveness}} and added value of public policies supporting locally-based networks for entrepreneurship and innovation in rural areas. The effects and impacts of public policies to support innovation and entrepreneurship in peripheral rural regions are often weak, diffuse and difficult to measure accurately. Therefore, and from the perspective of a case study, based on the LEADER initiative - links between actions of rural development approach in <b>Portugal</b> (<b>Alentejo</b> region) an attempt is made to assess direct and indirect impacts, the systemic effects of these policies and the effectiveness and added value of their effects. The LEADER initiative was launched in 1991 by European Commission as a result of growing concern about the future of rural areas. This approach to the subject of rural development by this instrument of public policy intervenes in the regions, notably, through cooperation between network agents and territories and encouragement of entrepreneurship...|$|R

50|$|In France, {{the grape}} was {{historically}} a blending partner with Aramon {{but in recent}} times has been made more into its own varietal. However, planting of new vines has steadily declined. In some areas of France the grape is now extinct. According to international wine guru and Master of Wine, Jancis Robinson, Alicante Bouschet {{is thought to have}} found its true home in <b>Portugal's</b> <b>Alentejo</b> where it was first planted at Herdade do Mouchão in the 1890s. Widely planted across the Alentejo wine region today (having grown exponentially in popularity from the late 1990s) it is frequently expensive, surpassing the quality and personality of other noble varieties. These top-end wines are prized for their 'size', dense colour and phenolic content. In Chile the grape is blended with Cabernet Sauvignon and to make concentrated varietal wines. In California the grape was popular among home winemakers during Prohibition and still grown today in Napa, Sonoma and Madera counties. Other areas with notable Alicante Bouschet plantings include Algeria, Israel and parts of central and southern Italy.|$|R

They add it in salads, boil it, or add it to casseroled chicken. In Turkey, besides being used in salads and in baked pastries, it is cooked as a vegetable similar to spinach, or is mixed with yogurt to form a tsatsiki variant. Similarly, in Egypt, it is known as reglah رجلة and cooked as a vegetable stew.
