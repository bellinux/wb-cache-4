The investigated system is SIMO, i.e. there is one transmit antenna onboard the satellite and a vertically polarized uniform linear array (ULA) receive antenna at the receiver terminal. Although it is known from theory that this structure yields only logarithmic increase of capacity versus the element number of the antenna, significant shift in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be possible with appropriate environment and design. The number of applications using global navigation satellite system positioning is increasing steadily and currently the European Space Agency explores the possibility of satellite navigation signals operating in an already allocated frequency band for <b>satellite</b> <b>radio</b> <b>navigation</b> around 5 [*]GHz [8].

40|$|Abstract — Global Positioning System (GPS) is a <b>satellite</b> based <b>radio</b> <b>navigation</b> system {{intended}} to provide highly accurate three dimensional positions and precise time on a continuous global basis. Usually, GPS accuracy is limited by several factors such as atmospheric, receiver and satellite based errors. Among them, Dilution of Precision (DOP) and multipath errors {{are very important to}} investigate the error for improving positional accuracy. In this paper, single frequency receiver data analysis in static mode is carried out. Using the GPS data, Horizontal Dilution of Precision (HDOP) results were presented. The presented preliminary results would be useful for developing suitable techniques for improving single frequency GPS positional accuracy by taking the HDOP errors into the consideration.

40|$|Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is a {{specific}} term for any satellite navigation system that provides autonomous geo-spatial positioning with global coverage. At present, United states Global Positioning System (GPS) is the only fully functional and available global navigation system. The advent of GPS has revolutionized the field of navigation particularly the field of civil aviation sector. The GPS is a reliable, all weather <b>satellite</b> based <b>radio</b> <b>navigation</b> system that provides accurate three dimensional (3 D) navigation solution i. e., position, velocity and timing information, up to 10 - 6 seconds anywhere on or above the earth’s surface.

For instance, European Union is developing GAGILEO, the Russian GLONASS is under maintenance phase and China is developing COMPASS to meet its navigational requirements. To provide interoperability with GPS and globally available navigational systems, new modulation schemes are introduced. One such modulation technique is Binary Offset Carrier (BOC) modulation which provides better accuracy than the existing BPSK modulation techniques GPS.

40|$|Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS) is {{the only}} {{possible}} <b>satellite</b> based <b>radio</b> <b>navigation</b> system able in a close future to achieve CAT II/III landing. The actual GBAS architecture using single frequency GPS has limitations in availability of integrity and can only achieve CAT I landings. The work I am going to present {{in the frame of}} my Diploma work details the possible strategies of dual frequency GBAS that can achieve the highest level of requirements (i. e. CAT III) for GPS as well as for Galileo navigation system. One of the highest threats for CAT II/III is the ionosphere gradient that can appear between the user and the ground GBAS subsystem during e. g. ionospheric anomaly. In order to minimize the negative influence of ionosphere gradient on the obtained results, different smoothing techniques can be used. The three smoothing techniques are presented in my work and their robustness against ionosphere anomaly is investigated. Simulations have been done with respect to different ionospheric gradient scenarios and using different combination of observables. Vertical protection levels and the availability of the integrity with respect to CAT II/III requirements is presented on the base of which the effectiveness of presented smoothing technologies is investigated. A conclusion and proposed future work ends this Diploma work. ...|$|R

The resonant frequency is calculated as the position of the slots is shifted from the right endpoint to the left endpoint on the patch between − 4. 2 mm ≤ Xslot ≤ 4. 2 mm with the steps of 0. 1 mm. The designed antenna is proposed for downlink of X band satellite, broadcasting satellite service, fixed-satellite service uplink, <b>satellite</b> (Earth-to-space), <b>radio</b> <b>navigation,</b> mobile-satellite (Earth-to-space), and KU band which can be achieved at the resonant frequencies of 7. 2 GHz, 12. 2 GHz, 14. 6 GHz, 17. 5 GHz and 19. 3 GHz. Next, High Frequency Electromagnetic Field Simulation software (ANSYS HFSS) results for the prototype microstrip antenna are compared with the values obtained through ANFIS system. It can be concluded that the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system in such designs can be conveniently used due to fuzzy system’s high approximation capability and much faster convergence rate. The best results for our ANFIS system can be obtained if Gaussian membership is used which leads to the mean absolute error of 1. 4653...|$|R
