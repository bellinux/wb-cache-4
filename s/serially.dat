5|$|The Vicar of Bullhampton was {{published}} <b>serially</b> in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine of Philadelphia in 1869–70. At the same time, an American book edition was issued by J. B. Lippincott & Co.|$|E
5|$|Because SI prefixes {{may not be}} {{concatenated}} (<b>serially</b> linked) {{within the}} name or symbol for a unit of measure, SI prefixes are used with the gram, not the kilogram, which already has a prefix {{as part of its}} name. For instance, one-millionth of a kilogram is 1mg (one milligram), not 1µkg (one microkilogram).|$|E
5|$|In addition, Pond Life is {{an earlier}} five-part mini serial prequel to this episode, which was {{released}} <b>serially</b> {{in the week}} {{leading up to the}} premiere. The fifth part hints at Amy and Rory's divorce.|$|E
5|$|The {{embryonic}} body segments (somites) {{of different}} arthropods taxa have diverged {{from a simple}} body plan with many similar appendages which are <b>serially</b> homologous, {{into a variety of}} body plans with fewer segments equipped with specialised appendages. The homologies between these have been discovered by comparing genes in evolutionary developmental biology.|$|E
5|$|As the {{publication}} date neared, difficulties arose. In January 1869, Dallas asked Trollope {{for permission to}} defer serial publication by three months. As Trollope had agreed not to allow another of his novels to run <b>serially</b> {{during the first six}} months of The Vicars career, the editor's request would have diminished the author's income. Trollope initially refused, but subsequently agreed to a delay of two months, with publication to begin in early July.|$|E
5|$|Emperor {{penguins}} are <b>serially</b> monogamous. They {{have only}} one mate each year, and stay faithful to that mate. However, fidelity between years is only about 15%. The narrow window of opportunity available for mating {{appears to be an}} influence, as there is a priority to mate and breed which often precludes waiting for the appearance of the previous year's partner.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{supposed}} deciphering of the Egyptian alphabet in July and October 1835, Smith ostensibly translated {{the majority of}} the Book of Abraham in November 1835 and did some minor revisions in March 1842. In translating the book, Smith dictated and Phelps, Warren Parrish, and Frederick G. Williams acted as scribes. The complete work was first published <b>serially</b> in Times and Seasons in 1842, and was later canonized in 1880 by the LDS Church as part of its Pearl of Great Price.|$|E
5|$|In Paris, Maria and Eugene Jolas nursed Joyce {{during his}} {{long years of}} writing Finnegans Wake. Were it not for their support (along with Harriet Shaw Weaver's {{constant}} financial support), {{there is a good}} possibility that his books might never have been finished or published. In their literary magazine transition, the Jolases published <b>serially</b> various sections of Finnegans Wake under the title Work in Progress. Joyce returned to Zurich in late 1940, fleeing the Nazi occupation of France.|$|E
5|$|In {{developmental}} biology, organs {{that developed}} in the embryo {{in the same manner}} and from similar origins, such as from matching primordia in successive segments of the same animal, are <b>serially</b> homologous. Examples include the legs of a centipede, the maxillary palp and labial palp of an insect, and the spinous processes of successive vertebrae in a vertebral column. Male and female reproductive organs are homologous if they develop from the same embryonic tissue, as do the ovaries and testicles of mammals including humans.|$|E
5|$|The {{combat system}} is turn-based instead of real-time. Gameplay is usually step-based, where player actions are {{performed}} <b>serially</b> {{and take a}} variable measure of in-game time to complete. Game processes (e.g., monster movement and interaction, progressive effects such as poisoning or starvation) advance based on {{the passage of time}} dictated by these actions. This requires the player to learn and apply tactics as they progress in the dungeon.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann made {{fundamental}} {{contributions to}} mathematical statistics. In 1941, he derived the exact {{distribution of the}} ratio of the mean square of successive differences to the sample variance for independent and identically normally distributed variables. This ratio was applied to the residuals from regression models and is commonly known as the Durbin–Watson statistic for testing the null hypothesis that the errors are <b>serially</b> independent against the alternative that they follow a stationary first order autoregression.|$|E
5|$|Cave 7, {{originally}} a Buddhist vihara, has been adapted as a Hindu temple {{dedicated to the}} god Ganesha. It {{is one of the}} Ashtavinayak shrines, a set of the eight prominent Ganesha shrines in Western Maharashtra. Twenty-six of the caves are individually numbered. The caves face to the south and are numbered <b>serially</b> from east to west. Caves 6 and 14 are chaitya-grihas (chapels), while the rest are viharas (dwellings for monks). The latter are in the form of dwellings and cells. There are also several rock-cut water cisterns; two of them have inscriptions. The layout of the caves, in general, are similar in pattern and shape. They generally have one or two sides with two long benches for occupants' use.|$|E
5|$|In 1884, Holmes {{published}} a book dedicated to the life and works of his friend Ralph Waldo Emerson. Later biographers would use Holmes's book as an outline for their own studies, but particularly useful was the section dedicated to Emerson's poetry, into which Holmes had particular insight. Beginning in January 1885, Holmes's third and last novel, A Mortal Antipathy, was published <b>serially</b> in The Atlantic Monthly. Later that year, Holmes contributed $10 to Walt Whitman, {{though he did not}} approve of his poetry, and convinced friend John Greenleaf Whittier to do the same. A friend of Whitman, a lawyer named Thomas Donaldson, had requested monetary donations from several authors to purchase a horse and buggy for Whitman who, in his old age, was becoming a shut-in.|$|E
5|$|McCracken met {{dancer and}} {{choreographer}} Bob Fosse while both were appearing in Dance Me a Song, {{in which she}} had a starring role and he was a specialty dancer. She was married to him from December 1952 to 1959. She worked actively to advance his career and encouraged his work as a choreographer. Her intervention with producer George Abbott led to his first major job as a choreographer, in The Pajama Game. They divorced as her health worsened, and as Fosse, who was <b>serially</b> unfaithful during their marriage, left McCracken for Gwen Verdon.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{complexity}} of proteins' conformation or configuration space (the set of possible shapes a protein can take), and limits in computing power, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have been severely limited in the timescales which they can study. While most proteins typically fold in the order of milliseconds, before 2010 simulations could only reach nanosecond to microsecond timescales. General-purpose supercomputers have been used to simulate protein folding, but such systems are intrinsically costly and typically shared among many research groups. Further, because the computations in kinetic models occur <b>serially,</b> strong scaling of traditional molecular simulations to these architectures is exceptionally difficult. Moreover, as protein folding is a stochastic process and can statistically vary over time, it is challenging computationally to use long simulations for comprehensive views of the folding process.|$|E
5|$|Other seals, {{like the}} walrus and most phocids, breed on ice with {{copulation}} usually {{taking place in}} the water (a few land-breeding species also mate in water). Females of these species tend to aggregate less. In addition, since ice is less stable than solid land, breeding sites change location each year, and males are unable to predict where females will stay during the breeding season. Hence polygyny tends to be weaker in ice-breeding species. An exception to this is the walrus, where females form dense aggregations perhaps due to their patchy food sources. Pinnipeds that breed on fast ice tend to cluster together more than those that breed on pack ice. Some of these species are <b>serially</b> monogamous, including the harp seal, crabeater seal and hooded seal. Seals that breed on ice tend to have little or no sexual dimorphism. In lobodontine seals, females are slightly longer than males. Walruses and hooded seals are unique among ice-breeding species in that they have pronounced sexual dimorphism in favor of males.|$|E
5|$|The Lord of the Rings film {{series is}} a series of epic fantasy-drama films {{directed}} by Peter Jackson. The three films, entitled , , and , were released <b>serially</b> worldwide between December 2001 and 2003. They are based on J. R. R. Tolkien's epic fantasy novel, The Lord of the Rings, adapted for the screen by Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens. Set in Tolkien's fictional Middle-earth, the plot follows the hobbit Frodo Baggins and his fellow members of the Fellowship of the Ring as they embark on a quest to destroy the One Ring, which will rid Middle-earth of the Dark Lord Sauron. A large ensemble cast was featured in the series, which included Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom, Liv Tyler, John Rhys-Davies, Sean Bean, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Andy Serkis, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, Ian Holm, John Noble, Bernard Hill, David Wenham, Miranda Otto, Karl Urban, and Brad Dourif.|$|E
5|$|The {{four types}} of flower parts, namely carpels, stamens, petals, and sepals, are {{homologous}} with and derived from leaves, as Goethe correctly noted in 1790. The development of these parts through a pattern of gene expression in the growing zones (meristems) is described by the ABC model of flower development. Each of the {{four types of}} flower parts is <b>serially</b> repeated in concentric whorls, controlled by {{a small number of}} genes acting in various combinations. Thus, A genes working alone result in sepal formation; A and B together produce petals; B and C together create stamens; C alone produces carpels. When none of the genes are active, leaves are formed. Two more groups of genes, D to form ovules and E for the floral whorls, complete the model. The genes are evidently ancient, as old as the flowering plants themselves.|$|E
25|$|The {{thyristor}} {{has three}} p-n junctions (<b>serially</b> named J1, J2, J3 from the anode).|$|E
25|$|Women {{tended to}} remain {{within a single}} lodge, while men would {{typically}} move between lodges. They took multiple sexual partners in <b>serially</b> monogamous relationships.|$|E
25|$|Before revision, the {{programmer}} {{could decide}} {{to have the}} arguments of a procedure evaluated <b>serially</b> instead of collaterally by using semicolons instead of commas (s).|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} Mercedes 190, the W124 {{was the first}} <b>serially</b> {{manufactured}} car in history to see widespread use of light-weight high-strength steels, which today are a standard in car design.|$|E
25|$|Limpkins may {{be either}} monogamous, with females joining a male's territory, or <b>serially</b> polyandrous, {{with two or}} more females joining a male. With the monogamous pairs, banding {{studies have shown that}} a small number of pairs will reform the {{following}} year (4 out of 18 pairs).|$|E
25|$|When {{antiretroviral}} {{drugs are}} used improperly, multi-drug resistant strains {{can become the}} dominant genotypes very rapidly. In the era before multiple drug classes were available (pre-1997), the reverse transcriptase inhibitors zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine, stavudine, and lamivudine were used <b>serially</b> or in combination leading {{to the development of}} multi-drug resistant mutations.|$|E
25|$|The 60 million presidential {{election}} ballot papers {{were kept in}} South Africa to prevent tampering. However, last-minute changes to add Abubakar to the list caused problems in distribution of ballots as papers did not arrive from South Africa until Friday evening. The reprinted papers were not <b>serially</b> numbered as was intended.|$|E
25|$|Different-sex sexual {{practices}} may be monogamous, <b>serially</b> monogamous, or polyamorous, and, {{depending on the}} definition of sexual practice, abstinent or autoerotic (including masturbation). Additionally, different religious and political movements have tried to influence or control changes in {{sexual practices}} including courting and marriage, though in most countries changes occur at a slow rate.|$|E
25|$|The main {{historical}} novel {{dealing with the}} war from the Japanese side is Shiba Ryōtarō's immense Clouds above the hill, published <b>serially</b> in several volumes between 1968 and 1972. The closely researched story spans the decade from the Sino-Japanese War to the Russo–Japanese War {{and went on to}} become the nation's favourite book.|$|E
25|$|Also, it {{may lead}} to the {{inadvertent}} termination of an undetected intrauterine pregnancy, or severe abnormality in any surviving pregnancy. Therefore, it is recommended that methotrexate should only be administered when hCG has been <b>serially</b> monitored with a rise less than 35% over 48 hours, which practically excludes a viable intrauterine pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Serial ATA (SATA). The SATA {{data cable}} has one data pair for {{differential}} {{transmission of data}} to the device, and one pair for differential receiving from the device, just like EIA-422. That requires that data be transmitted <b>serially.</b> A similar differential signaling system is used in RS485, LocalTalk, USB, FireWire, and differential SCSI.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{mesothorax}} and metathorax {{hold the}} wings, {{they have a}} combined name called the pterothorax (pteron = wing). The forewing, which goes by different names in different orders (e.g., the tegmina in Orthoptera and elytra in Coleoptera), arises between the mesonotum and the mesopleura, and the hindwing articulates between the metanotum and metapleura. The legs arise from the mesopleura and metapleura. The mesothorax and metathorax each have a pleural suture (mesopleural and metapleural sutures) that runs from the wing base to the coxa of the leg. The sclerite anterior to the pleural suture is called the episternum (<b>serially,</b> the mesepisternum and metepisternum). The sclerite posterior to the suture is called the epimiron (<b>serially,</b> the mesepimiron and metepimiron). Spiracles, the external organs of the respiratory system, are found on the pterothorax, usually one between the pro- and mesopleoron, {{as well as one}} between the meso- and metapleuron.|$|E
25|$|The OLS {{estimator}} {{is consistent}} when the regressors are exogenous, and optimal {{in the class}} of linear unbiased estimators when the errors are homoscedastic and <b>serially</b> uncorrelated. Under these conditions, the method of OLS provides minimum-variance mean-unbiased estimation when the errors have finite variances. Under the additional assumption that the errors are normally distributed, OLS is the maximum likelihood estimator.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of high-speed serial data interfaces such as USB made semiconductor memory systems with <b>serially</b> accessed storage viable, and the simultaneous {{development of}} small, high-speed, low-power microprocessor systems allowed {{this to be}} incorporated into extremely compact systems. Serial access requires far fewer electrical connections for the memory chips than does parallel access, which has simplified the manufacture of multi-gigabyte drives.|$|E
25|$|The {{levels of}} {{circulating}} anti-dsDNA antibodies fluctuate with disease activity in SLE. Increases in titres of the antibodies can coincide with, or even precede {{an increase of}} disease activity. For this reason titres are <b>serially</b> monitored by clinicians to assess disease progression. Titres are monitored more often in cases of more active lupus than that of less active lupus at intervals of 1–3 months and 6–12 months, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Murat Kurnaz is {{a former}} detainee who was {{released}} without charges in August 2006. He is a Turkish-born German resident who was eighteen when captured {{and is now a}} German citizen. His memoir of his experience, Five Years of My Life: An Innocent Man in Guantanamo (2008) was published in the German, French, Norwegian, Danish and Dutch languages in 2007. Excerpts were published <b>serially</b> by The Guardian beginning April 23, 2008.|$|E
25|$|The {{king penguin}} {{is able to}} breed at three years of age, {{although}} {{only a very small}} minority (5% recorded at Crozet Islands) actually do then; the average age of first breeding is around 6 years. King penguins are <b>serially</b> monogamous. They have only one mate each year, and stay faithful to that mate. However, fidelity between years is only about 29%. The long breeding cycle may contribute to this low rate.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} other 19th century novels, Onegin was written and {{published}} <b>serially,</b> with parts of each chapter often appearing published in magazines before the first printing of each chapter. Many changes, some small and some large, were made from the first appearance to the final edition during Pushkin's lifetime. The following dates mostly come from Nabokov's study of the photographs of Pushkin's drafts that were available at the time, {{as well as other}} people's work on the subject.|$|E
