40|$|Yeah, I {{seen your}} little town at night. It 2 ̆ 7 s usually {{me and the}} moon coming up through there about three, four in the morning, boat on the {{squeaking}} trailer behind me, still dripping green river water from its bunks, and I notice your Dollar General lit up for <b>safety,</b> <b>pole</b> lights shining down on the empty yellow lines, feral cats slinking around the Dairymart, and one of two cars of high schoolers still hustling split-tail {{in the parking lot}} of the school. Used to be every buck wanted his Cutlass jacked up on air shocks. That or a lifted four-by-four. Now about every kid I see gots a foreign job, all lowered so the bumpers scrape pulling into the post office. Course, what 2 ̆ 7 s kids today got to mail anyway? But one more thing on them feral cats: more than once, I seen two or three toms circling an old mama cat in heat. They say a cat screams like it does when it 2 ̆ 7 s getting mated because a tomcat has a barbed penis. They also tell you a possum has a forked penis, but I don 2 ̆ 7 t even know how something like that would work. But yeah, I seen your houses all dark, everybody inside sleeping away, drooling on pillows. I know which places got them little baby blues, cause I see the light on low in some corner, mama rocking her baby don 2 ̆ 7 t want to sleep. I seen all that and more...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Corrective Action Plan (CAP) is to provide the {{strategy}} and methodology to close the Area 22 Sewage Lagoons site. The CAU will be closed following state and federal regulations and the FFACO (1996). Site characterization was done during September 1999, Soil samples were collected using a direct-push method and a backhoe. Soil samples were collected from the sludge bed, sewage lagoons, strainer box, and Imhoff tank areas. Characterization of the manholes associated with the septic system leading to the Imhoff tank was done during March 2000. The results of the characterization were reported in the Corrective Action Decision Document (CADD) (DOE/NV, 2000). Soil sample {{results indicated that the}} only constituent of concern (COC) detected above Preliminary Action Levels (PALs) was total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) as diesel-range organics. This COC was detected in three samples from the sludge bed at concentrations up to 580 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg). This exceeds the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) regulatory action level for TPH of 100 mg/kg (Nevada Administrative Code, 1996). Excavation of the area during characterization uncovered asphalt debris, four <b>safety</b> <b>poles,</b> and strands of barbed wire. The TPH-impacted soil and debris will be removed and disposed in the NTS Area 6 Hydrocarbon Landfill...|$|R
40|$|Inground decay is a {{major problem}} {{associated}} with the reliability and <b>safety</b> of timber <b>poles.</b> In modeling inground decay for effective maintenance strategies for timber poles, it is important to identify soil factors that are influential to the inground decay. This paper investigates some of the important influential soil factors and testing methods for those factors. Full Tex...|$|R
2500|$|... 12 October 2007: Nine South African National Defence Force (SANDF) {{soldiers}} were killed and 14 injured by the system during a training exercise at the SANDF Battle School at Lohatla in the Northern Cape province. A line of eight cannons were engaging a tank hulk in manual ground fire with the guns at low elevation and the maximum traverse of the barrels secured by <b>safety</b> <b>poles</b> and tethers. The rightmost gun jammed while firing {{and had to be}} repaired by technicians. Shortly after the gun was cleared to fire again, the gun malfunctioned, entered automatic mode, broke through the traversal-restriction safety mechanisms and began firing, striking the other guns along the firing line. [...] Initial reports suggested that the malfunction was caused when the gun underwent an unexplained hang fire of the explosive 35mm ammunition in the magazines, causing the turret to swing uncontrolled through 360 degrees, firing wildly until it exhausted its remaining ammunition. A statement issued by the South African Defense Minister, Mosiuoa Lekota, however, stated that the gun had inexplicably traversed 90 degrees to the left, breaking through the safety mechanisms, and fired only a -second-long burst, striking all of the soldiers located on the right-hand side of their guns. The accident report published by the SANDF in January 2008 blamed [...] "undetected mechanical failure—which the manufacturers of an anti-aircraft gun allegedly kept secret". The report says the gun malfunctioned because a spring pin, which {{is the size of a}} matchstick, sheared. [...] Other sources blamed poor training and safety procedures in the SANDF.|$|R
40|$|The Space Transportation System goal {{of return}} to safe flight {{required}} that the Orbiter vehicle provide the crewmembers with a means of escape during controlled gliding flight. Because of its simplicity and <b>safety</b> the <b>pole</b> escape concept was selected for use during crew escape. To show that this concept would work in the Orbiter, wind tunnel tests, flight testing, and analytical simulation of the pole concept were pursued. This paper addresses each of these activities, showing how the wind tunnel test demonstrated the feasibility of the concept, how the flight testing was used to extract crew aero and Orbiter clearance margins, and how analytical simulations were used to verify Orbiter clearance margins. The analytical assessment of the Orbiter clearance margins shows that the pole concept will provide a minimum of 7 -ft dispersed clearance for the NASA astronaut corps...|$|R
40|$|Round timbers are {{extensively}} used as utility {{poles in}} Australia for electricity distribution and communication. Lack {{of information on}} their conditions results in great difficulties on asset management for industries. Despite the development of various non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques for evaluating the condition of piles, few NDTs are reported for applications on timber poles. This paper addresses challenges and issues on development of NDTs for condition assessment and embedded length of timber poles. For this paper, it is mainly focusing on determining the embedded length of the pole considering loss of the sufficient embedment length is a main factor compromising capacity and <b>safety</b> of timber <b>poles.</b> Since it is impractical for generating longitudinal waves by impacting {{from the top of}} poles, utilizing flexural wave from side impact on poles becomes attractive. However, the flexural wave is known by its highly dispersive nature. In this paper, one dimensional wave theory, guided wave theory and advanced signal processing techniques have been introduced in order to provide a solution for the problem. Two signal processing techniques, namely short kernel method and continuous wavelet transform, have been investigated for processing flexural wave signals to evaluate wave velocity and embedment length of timber poles in service...|$|R
