When S 1 was irradiated at 254 nm {{in the presence}} of [carbonyl- 14 C]- or [adenine- 14 C]NAD, the uptake of radioactivity was equivalent to 0. 75 and 0. 1 mol/mol respectively, while the NAD glycohydrolase activity was abolished. Inactivation was thus accompanied by crosslinking of the nicotinamide portion of NAD to the protein. Sequence determination of purified radioactive peptides indicated that Glu- 129 was a major <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>labelling.</b> This residue is therefore closely associated with either NAD binding or hydrolysis...|$|E

40|$|Understanding the {{molecular}} basis of natural ligand binding and {{activation of the}} glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP 1) receptor may facilitate the development of agonist drugs useful {{for the management of}} type 2 diabetes mellitus. We previously reported molecular approximations between carboxyl-terminal residues 24 and 35 within GLP 1 and its receptor. In this work, we have focused on the amino-terminal region of GLP 1, known to be critical for receptor activation. We developed two high-affinity, full agonist photolabile GLP 1 probes having <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> covalent attachment in positions 6 and 12 of the 30 -residue peptide (GLP 1 (7 – 36)). Both probes bound to the receptor specifically and covalently labeled single distinct sites. Chemical and protease cleavage <b>of</b> the <b>labeled</b> receptor identified the juxtamembrane region of its amino-terminal domain as the region of covalent attachment of the position 12 probe, whereas the region <b>of</b> <b>labeling</b> by the position 6 probe was localized to the first extracellular loop. Radiochemical sequencing identified receptor residue Tyr 145, adjacent to the first transmembrane segment, as the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>labeling</b> by the position 12 probe, and receptor residue Tyr 205, within the first extracellular loop, as the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>labeling</b> by the position 6 probe. These data provide support for a common mechanism for natural ligand binding and activation of family B G protein-coupled receptors. This region of interaction of peptide amino-terminal domains with the receptor may provide a pocket that can be targeted by small molecule agonists...|$|R
40|$|The {{superior}} tarsus is a {{plate of}} tissue that stiffens the upper eyelid, gives it support and determines its form. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to relate the composition of its extracellular matrix to its function and to report regional differences that may influence the activity of its Meibomian glands. Fourteen methanol-fixed specimens were cryosectioned for immunohistochemistry and labelled with a panel of monoclonal antibodies against a wide range of collagens, glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans. Labelling was detected with avidin–biotin–peroxidase. A further six specimens were formalin-fixed for routine histology. The tarsal plate immunolabelled strongly for types I, III and VI collagen and for aggrecan, versican, tenascin, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) together with a variety of glycosaminoglycans (notably chondroitin 6 sulphate). A region of strong labelling for aggrecan, dermatan sulphate and chondroitin 6 sulphate immediately surrounded the Meibomian glands. The <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>labelling</b> corresponded to a layer of acellular and amorphous matrix seen histologically that we have termed the ‘territorial matrix’. The results suggested that the tarsal plate is a specialized connective tissue that is neither purely fibrous nor cartilaginous, yet has an aggrecan content that probably contributes to its stiffness. Its unique character highlights the challenge in choosing an ideal mechanical substitute. As patients with rheumatoid arthritis often have problems relating to tear film deficiency, the ability of aggrecan or COMP to act as autoantigens may be significant. An immune reaction directed against these molecules could alter tarsal gland function by interfering with the interaction between the glands and their territorial matrix...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} 10 years NMR {{spectroscopy}} {{has been established}} as a non-invasive tool for physiological and biochemical investigations on living material [1, 2]. Depending on the phenomenon to be studied, {{one of the following}} NMR-sensitive nuclei can be used: phosphorous (31 P), sodium (23 Na), the proton (1 H), and carbon (13 C). Renal cell metabolism [3] has thus far been characterized primarily by measuring substrate concentrations, concentrations of high energy phosphates, or enzyme activities in vitro. These parameters describe a certain metabolic state of a cell at a given time, but fail to reveal fluxes through metabolic pathways as they occur in the living cell. Flux studies are, however, possible when labelled substrates are used. Such studies using 14 C-labelled compounds have revealed some overall features of metabolism; a quantitation of the relative velocities of the various pathways has not been possible because of the difficulties to isolate the labelled intermediates and to determine the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>labelling</b> within the molecules. Such difficulties can be surmounted by using 13 C-labelled substrates where each C atom, when labelled during its utilization in the cell, exhibits a unique resonance, thus making the mapping of intracellular pathways of a certain carbon possible. This review focuses on the application of 13 C NMR spectroscopy for the elucidation of renal metabolic pathways. After providing a short description of the general properties of 13 C NMR spectroscopy, studies on the proximal tubule [4 – 9] are used to examplify the advantage of the 13 C spectroscopy compared to the more commonly used 14 C method. These advantages are considered sufficient to compensate for the high cost of 13 C-labelled compounds and the instrumentation required for the measurement. In more general terms, 13 C NMR spectroscopy can be considered as a valuable addition to NMR experiments where other nuclei have been used. One of the most frequent nucleus used in non-invasive measurements is 31 P, which allows the measurement of the concentration of energy-rich phosphates and the ATP turnover in renal tubule suspensions, intact kidneys or isolated cells. Another parameter for non-invasive investigations of renal transport linked to metabolism is 23 Na, where changes in intra- and extracellular sodium can be recorded. The application of the latter two methods has been described recently [10 – 16]...|$|E

The ESR spectrum of spin-labeled chicken liver fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphatase showed that the <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> <b>labeling</b> were highly immobilized when the enzyme was chemically modified by spin label iodoacetate, suggesting that the sulfhydryl groups of the protein are in a small, confined environment.

40|$|The glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP 1) {{receptor}} is {{a member}} of Family B G protein-coupled receptors and represents an important drug target for type 2 diabetes. Despite recent solution {{of the structure of the}} amino-terminal domain of this receptor and that of several close family members, understanding of the molecular basis of natural ligand GLP 1 binding to its intact receptor remains limited. The goal of this study was to explore spatial approximations between specific receptor residues within the carboxyl terminus of GLP 1 and its receptor as normally docked. Therefore, we developed and characterized two high affinity, full-agonist photolabile GLP 1 probes having sites for covalent attachment in positions 24 and 35. Both probes labeled the receptor specifically and saturably. Subsequent peptide mapping using chemical and proteinase cleavages of purified wild-type and mutant GLP 1 receptor identified that the Arg 131 –Lys 136 segment at the juxtamembrane region of the receptor amino terminus contained the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>labeling</b> for the position 24 probe, and the specific receptor residue labeled by this probe was identified as Glu 133 by radiochemical sequencing. Similarly, nearby residue Glu 125 within the same region of the receptor amino-terminal domain was identified as the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>labeling</b> by the position 35 probe. These data represent the first direct demonstration of spatial approximation between GLP 1 and its intact receptor as docked, providing two important constraints for the modeling of this interaction. This should expand our understanding of the molecular basis of natural agonist ligand binding to the GLP 1 receptor and may be relevant to other family members...|$|R
40|$|SummarySingle-particle {{electron}} microscopy (EM) {{is a powerful}} tool for studying the structures of large biological molecules. However, the achievable resolution does not always allow for direct recognition of individual protein domains. Labels that can be visualized by EM have been developed for protein termini, but tagging internal domains remains a challenge. We describe a robust strategy for determining the position <b>of</b> internal <b>sites</b> within EM maps, termed domain localization by RCT sampling (DOLORS). DOLORS uses monovalent streptavidin added posttranslationally to tagged sites in the target protein. Internal labels generally display less conformational flexibility than terminal labels, providing more precise positional information. Automated methods are used to rapidly generate assemblies of unique 3 D models allowing the attachment <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> <b>labeled</b> domains to be accurately identified and thus provide an overall architectural map of the molecule...|$|R

In protein PTM we have analysed three substrate proteins, troponin, tubulin and mutant dyphtheria toxin.

Breath 13 CO 2 enrichment and 14 CO 2 specific activity were followed for 6 h to {{determine the}} labeled CO 2 decay rates. Acetate enters directly into the TCA cycle; hence, if palmitate transits a large lipid pool before oxidation, 13 CO 2 enrichment (from palmitate) should decay slower than 14 CO 2 specific activity (from acetate). Breath 13 CO 2 enrichment and 14 CO 2 specific activity decayed at a similar rate after stopping the tracer infusions (half-lives of 13 CO 2 and 14 CO 2 decay: mean [+/- SE] 106. 6 +/- 8. 9 min, and 96. 9 +/- 6. 0 min, respectively, P = NS), which suggests that palmitate enters the TCA cycle directly and that label fixation occurs after citrate synthesis. Significant label fixation was shown in plasma glutamate/glutamine and lactate/pyruvate during infusion of either [1, 2 - 13 C]acetate or [U- 13 C]palmitate, suggesting that TCA cycle exchange reactions are at least partly responsible for label fixation. This was consistent with our finding that the half-lives of 13 CO 2 enrichment and 14 CO 2 specific activity decreased significantly during exercise to 14. 4 +/- 3 min and 16. 8 +/- 1 min, respectively, since exercise significantly increases {{the rate of the}} TCA cycle in relation to that of the TCA cycle exchange reactions.

We have prepared two new photolabile probes incorporating a p-benzoyl-l-phenylalanine into positions 16 and 20 of GLP 1 (7 – 36). Both probes bound to the GLP 1 receptor specifically and with high affinity. These were each fully efficacious agonists, stimulating cAMP accumulation in receptor-bearing CHO cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Each probe specifically labeled a single receptor site. Protease cleavage and radiochemical sequencing identified receptor residue Leu 141 above transmembrane segment one as its <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>labeling</b> for the position 16 probe, whereas the position 20 probe labeled receptor residue Trp 297 within the second extracellular loop. Establishing ligand residue approximation with this loop region is unique among family members and may help to orient the receptor amino-terminal domain relative to its helical bundle region...|$|R
40|$|Although the dissociative {{anesthetic}} dizocilpine [(1) -MK- 801] inhibits nicotinic {{acetylcholine receptor}} (AChR) function in a noncompetitive manner, {{the location of the}} dizocilpine binding site(s) has yet to be clearly established. Thus, to characterize the binding site for dizocilpine on the AChR we examined 1) the dissociation constant (Kd) and stoichiometry of [3 H]dizocilpine binding; 2) the displacement of dizocilpine radioligand binding by noncompetitive inhibitors (NCIs) and conversely dizocilpine displacement of fluorescent and radiolabeled NCIs from their respective high-affinity binding sites on the AChR; and 3) pho-toaffinity <b>labeling</b> <b>of</b> the AChR using 125 I-dizocilpine. The results establish that one high-affinity (Kd 5 4. 8 mM) and several (3 – 6) low-affinity (Kd 5; 140 mM) binding sites exist for dizocilpine on the desensitized and resting AChR, respectively. The bind-ing of the fluorescent NCIs ethidium, quinacrine, and crystal violet as well as [3 H]thienylcyclohexylpiperidine was inhibited by dizocilpine on desensitized AChRs. However, Schild-type analyses indicate that only the inhibition of quinacrine in the desensitized state seems to be mediated by a mutually exclu-sive action. Photoaffinity <b>labeling</b> <b>of</b> the AChR by 125 I-dizo-cilpine was primarily restricted to the a 1 subunit and subse-quent mapping revealed that the principal <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> <b>labeling</b> are localized to the M 4 (; 70 %) and M 1 (30 %) transmembrane domains. Collectively, the data indicate that the high-affinity dizocilpine binding site is not located in the lumen of the ion channel but probably near the quinacrine binding locus at a nonluminal domain in the AChR desensitized state. The muscle-type {{nicotinic acetylcholine receptor}} (AChR) is the archetype of the ligand-gated ion channel receptor super-family. This receptor superfamily includes the neuronal-type AChRs as well as types A and C g-aminobutyric acid, 5 -hy-droxytryptamine type 3, and glycine receptors (for reviews...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} removal of Ca 2 + bound to thrombospondin (TSP) on the protein {{structure}} in solution {{has been investigated}} using ESR spin-label techniques. A maleimide spin label was selectively attached to the free thiol group presumably near the carboxyl-terminal domain in which Ca 2 +-binding sites are situated. The ESR spectra of spin-labeled TSP showed that the bound label undergoes a relatively fast rotational motion with an effective rotational correlation time in the nanosecond time regimes. Removal of bound Ca 2 + in TSP by dialyzing spin-labeled TSP from a Ca 2 +-containing buffer into an EDTA-containing buffer resulted {{in an increase in}} the mobility <b>of</b> the bound <b>label</b> by a factor of 2. 3. The data suggest that EDTA chelation of bound Ca 2 + in TSP induces a conformational change of TSP at least near the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> spin <b>labeling...</b>|$|R
40|$|To monitor {{pancreatic}} islet transplantation efficiency, reliable noninvasive imaging methods, such as {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) are needed. Although an efficient uptake of MRI contrast agent is required for islet cell labeling, commercially-available magnetic nanoparticles are not efficiently transduced into cells. We herein report the in vivo detection <b>of</b> transplanted islets <b>labeled</b> with a novel cationic nanoparticle that allowed for noninvasive monitoring of islet grafts in diabetic mice in real time. The positively-charged nanoparticles were transduced into a b-cell line, MIN 6 cells, and into isolated islets for 1 hr. MRI showed a marked decrease in the signal intensity on T 1 - and T 2 -weighted images at the implantation <b>site</b> <b>of</b> the <b>labeled</b> MIN 6 cells or islets in the left kidneys of mice. These {{data suggest that the}} novel positively-charged nanoparticle could be useful to detect and monitor islet engraftment, which would greatly aid in the clinica...|$|R

40|$|Dihydrouridine (DHU) {{positions}} within tRNAs {{have long}} been used as sites to covalently attach fluorophores, {{by virtue of their}} unique chemical reactivity toward reduction by NaBH 4, their abundance within prokaryotic and eukaryotic tRNAs, and the biochemical functionality <b>of</b> the <b>labeled</b> tRNAs so produced. Interpretation <b>of</b> experiments employing <b>labeled</b> tRNAs can depend on knowing the distribution of dye among the DHU positions present in a labeled tRNA. Here we combine matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectroscopy (MALDI-MS) analysis of oligonucleotide fragments and thin layer chromatography to resolve and quantify <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> DHU <b>labeling</b> by the fluorophores Cy 3, Cy 5, and proflavin in Escherichia coli tRNAPhe and E. coli tRNAArg. The MALDI-MS results led us to re-examine the precise chemistry of the reactions that result in fluorophore introduction into tRNA. We demonstrate that, in contrast to an earlier suggestion that has long been unchallenged in the literature, such introduction proceeds via a substitution reaction on tetrahydrouridine, the product of NaBH 4 reduction of DHU, resulting in formation of substituted tetrahydrocytidines within tRNA...|$|R
