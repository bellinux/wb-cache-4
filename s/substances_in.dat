5|$|An {{important}} function of enzymes {{is in the}} digestive systems of animals. Enzymes such as amylases and proteases break down large molecules (starch or proteins, respectively) into smaller ones, {{so they can be}} absorbed by the intestines. Starch molecules, for example, are too large to be absorbed from the intestine, but enzymes hydrolyze the starch chains into smaller molecules such as maltose and eventually glucose, which can then be absorbed. Different enzymes digest different food <b>substances.</b> <b>In</b> ruminants, which have herbivorous diets, microorganisms in the gut produce another enzyme, cellulase, to break down the cellulose cell walls of plant fiber.|$|E
5|$|Antbirds are diurnal: they feed, breed {{and defend}} territories during the day. Many {{of the family}} are, however, {{reluctant}} to enter areas of direct sunlight where it breaks through the forest canopy. Antbirds will engage in anting, a behaviour in which ants (or other arthropods) are rubbed on the feathers before being discarded or eaten. While this has conventionally been considered a way to remove and control feather parasites, {{it has been suggested}} that for antbirds it may simply be a way to deal with the distasteful <b>substances</b> <b>in</b> prey items.|$|E
5|$|Antibodies are protein {{components}} of an {{adaptive immune system}} whose main function is to bind antigens, or foreign <b>substances</b> <b>in</b> the body, and target them for destruction. Antibodies can be secreted into the extracellular environment or anchored in the membranes of specialized B cells known as plasma cells. Whereas enzymes are limited in their binding affinity for their substrates by the necessity of conducting their reaction, antibodies have no such constraints. An antibody's binding affinity to its target is extraordinarily high.|$|E

5|$|At {{this time}} though the {{chemical}} {{nature of what}} exactly in the blood conferred this protection was not known. In a few decades to follow, it was shown that the protective serum could neutralize and precipitate toxins, and clump bacteria. All these functions were attributed to different <b>substances</b> <b>in</b> the serum, and named accordingly as antitoxin, precipitin and agglutinin. That all the three substances were one entity (gamma globulins) was demonstrated by Elvin A. Kabat in 1939. In the preceding year Kabat had demonstrated the heterogeneity of antibodies through ultracentrifugation studies of horses' sera.|$|E
5|$|Concentrations of {{midazolam}} or {{its major}} metabolite, 1-hydroxymidazolam glucuronide, may {{be measured in}} plasma, serum, or whole blood to monitor for safety in those receiving the drug therapeutically, to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients, or to assist in a forensic investigation of a case of fatal overdosage. Patients with renal dysfunction may exhibit prolongation of elimination half-life for both the parent drug and its active metabolite, with accumulation of these two <b>substances</b> <b>in</b> the bloodstream {{and the appearance of}} adverse depressant effects.|$|E
5|$|For <b>substances</b> <b>in</b> {{solution}} the {{isoelectric point}} (pI) {{is defined as}} the pH at which the sum, weighted by charge value, of concentrations of positively charged species is equal to the weighted sum of concentrations of negatively charged species. In the case that there is one species of each type, the isoelectric point can be obtained directly from the pK values. Take the example of glycine, defined as AH. There are two dissociation equilibria to consider.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the Court's decision in Schmerber, many legal scholars feared the ruling {{would be used to}} limit civil liberties. Other scholars, including Nita A. Farahany, Benjamin Holley, and John G. New, have suggested courts may use the ruling in Schmerber to justify the use of mind reading devices against criminal suspects. Because the Court's ruling in Schmerber prohibited the use of warrantless blood tests in most circumstances, some commentators argue that the decision was responsible for the proliferation of breathalyzers to test for alcohol and urine analyses to test for controlled <b>substances</b> <b>in</b> criminal investigations.|$|E
5|$|Many {{medicinal}} plants produce chemical compounds which {{give them an}} evolutionary advantage, such as defending against herbivores or, like salicylic acid, acting against other plants. These are often useful as drugs, and the content and known pharmacological activity of these <b>substances</b> <b>in</b> {{medicinal plants}} is the scientific basis for their use in modern medicine, and in the cases where medicinal plants have been analysed, also of some traditional medicines. The major classes of pharmacologically active phytochemicals are described below, with examples of medicinal plants that contain them.|$|E

5|$|The species easily {{attaches}} {{itself to}} stones, which {{allows it to}} live in fast-running waters and in wave zone in lakes. The ability of Theodoxus fluviatilis to live in freshwater and also in brackish water demonstrates the phenotypic plasticity of this species. This small snail can live in up to 60 m depth in coastal waters. Brackish water populations can live in salinities of up to 15‰ in the Baltic Sea or up to 18‰ in the Baltic Sea and in Black Sea. Populations from brackish water can tolerate higher salinity than populations from freshwater. Brackish water populations have much higher accumulation of ninhydrin-positive <b>substances</b> <b>in</b> the foot.|$|E
5|$|The {{victims of}} this {{poisoning}} were almost exclusively post-menopausal women with low iron and other mineral body stores. Similar general population cadmium exposures {{in other parts of}} the world have not resulted in the same health problems because the populations maintained sufficient iron and other mineral levels. Thus, although cadmium is a major factor in the itai-itai disease in Japan, most researchers have concluded that it was one of several factors. Cadmium is one of six substances banned by the European Union's Restriction on Hazardous Substances (RoHS) directive, which regulates hazardous <b>substances</b> <b>in</b> electrical and electronic equipment but allows for certain exemptions and exclusions from the scope of the law.|$|E
5|$|A {{peroxidase}} enzyme {{known as}} MroAPO (Marasmius rotula aromatic peroxygenase) is attracting research interest for possible applications in biocatalysis. In general, enzymes that catalyze oxygen-transfer reactions are of great utility in chemical synthesis since they work selectively and under ambient conditions. Fungal peroxidases can catalyze oxidations {{that are difficult}} for the organic chemist, including those involving aromatic substrates such as aniline, 4-aminophenol, hydroquinone, resorcinol, catechol, and paracetamol. The M.rotula enzyme is the first fungal peroxygenase that can be produced in high yields. It is highly stable over a wide pH range, and {{in a variety of}} organic solvents. The enzyme has other potential for use as a biosensor for aromatic <b>substances</b> <b>in</b> environmental analysis and drug monitoring.|$|E

5|$|Between 1937 and 1938, Bishop {{studied the}} effects of various factors, {{including}} different <b>substances</b> <b>in</b> blood and different temperatures, on the feeding behaviour of the chicken malaria (Plasmodium gallinaceum) vector, Aedes aegypti.

Her subsequent work was spurred by the outbreak of the Second World War. During the war, she investigated alternative chemotherapies for malaria. Her research aided the British war effort because the most prevalent antimalarial, quinine, was difficult to obtain due to the Japanese occupation of the Dutch West Indies.

They found a large assortment of <b>substances</b> <b>in</b> Hendrix's room that had apparently been given to him by fans. Soon afterwards, they were paid a visit by three detectives who told them that they were under police surveillance by officers living in a nearby house.|$|E
5|$|In the European Union, the {{directive}} on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous <b>Substances</b> <b>in</b> Electrical and Electronic Equipment (see RoHS) bans mercury from certain electrical and electronic products, and limits {{the amount of}} mercury in other products to less than 1000 ppm. There are restrictions for mercury concentration in packaging (the limit is 100 ppm for sum of mercury, lead, hexavalent chromium and cadmium) and batteries (the limit is 5 ppm). In July 2007, the European Union also banned mercury in non-electrical measuring devices, such as thermometers and barometers. The ban applies to new devices only, and contains exemptions for the health care sector and a two-year grace period for manufacturers of barometers.|$|E
