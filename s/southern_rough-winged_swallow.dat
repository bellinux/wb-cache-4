50|$|They {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} to the bank swallow, but have a dusky throat and breast.

50|$|There {{are many}} {{subspecies}} of this swallow, which some authorities may split into different species. In particular, four northeastern races, including nominate P. p. pristoptera, have conspicuous white underwing coverts (all other subspecies are green-glossed and have completely dark underwings), {{and may be}} split as the eastern <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallow</b> or eastern saw-wing (swallow), P. orientalis. This leaves P. p. holomelaena as the black <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallow,</b> P. holomelaena. Other subspecies are also sometimes elevated to species status, but Turner and Rose take the view that all the races of the black <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallow</b> are, at best, incipient species.|$|R

50|$|The black <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallow</b> breeds in open wooded habitats, {{and has a}} {{preference}} for wetter areas, although some races occur in mountain grassland habitat. It breeds across Africa from eastern Nigeria and Ethiopia south to Angola, northern Zimbabwe and northern Mozambique.

50|$|Many {{species of}} birds can be seen {{throughout}} the park, including purple gallinule, black-bellied whistling duck, black-crowned night heron, great egret, white ibis, common moorhen, roseate spoonbill,northern flicker, glossy ibis, least bittern, limpkin, mottled duck, northern <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallow,</b> northern flicker, and sora. Reptile species include the American alligator and Florida redbelly turtle. Mammals include marsh rabbit, raccoons, bobcats, and the river otter.|$|R
50|$|Black <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallows</b> {{are usually}} seen in pairs or small groups hunting for flying insects in {{woodland}} clearings and edges, above forest, or over water.

50|$|The {{adult is}} 13.5 cm {{in length and}} weighs 15 g. It is brown above, with blackish wings and tail and a pale grey rump. The throat and upper breast are rufous with the lower underparts yellowish-white. The tail is {{slightly}} forked. It is similar in appearance to its northern counterpart, the northern <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallow,</b> but is more uniform in colour, particularly on the rump.|$|R

50|$|The animal {{population}} includes birds (bald eagles, owls, belted kingfishers, cliff and northern <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallows,</b> seagulls, sandpipers, and herons), mammals (black-tailed deer, mink, harbour seals, otters, bats), reptiles (garter snakes and possibly northern alligator lizard), and numerous invertebrates. Surprisingly, the raccoon is absent; {{its failure to}} become established on the island has allowed ground-nesting birds to maintain their populations. Mink is the only native predatory mammal on land. Many mice as well.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallow</b> {{is classified}} as least concern by the IUCN. Although its population is declining, it is not declining fast enough nor is its range small enough to justify a classification of vulnerable. In addition, this species {{is estimated to be}} composed of about 15 million individual birds, so it is not vulnerable under the population size criterion. This swallow has been found to adapt well to humans and sometimes nests in artificial cavities created by them.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallow</b> is {{native to}} Bahamas, Belize, Canada, Cayman Islands, Costa Rica, Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Puerto Rico, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, Turks and Caicos Islands, and the United States. They are vagrant to Aruba, Barbados, Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba, Curaçao, Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe, and Sint Maarten. The populations in the US and Canada {{have been found to}} winter in the southern-most US and further south. While this is true, the populations in Mexico and further south seem to be non-migratory, although local post-breeding movements do occur. This swallow has been found to occur as high as 2500 m in Costa Rica.|$|R
50|$|Located in the Northern Rockies Missoula County has {{a typical}} Rocky Mountain ecology. Local {{wildlife}} includes populations of white-tailed deer, black bears, osprey, and bald eagles. During the winter months, rapid snow melt on Mount Jumbo {{due to its}} steep slope leaves grass available for grazing elk and mule deer. The rivers around Missoula provide nesting habitats for bank <b>swallows,</b> northern <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallows</b> and belted kingfishers. Killdeer and spotted sandpipers can be seen foraging insects along the gravel bars. Other species include song sparrows, catbirds, several species of warblers, and the pileated woodpecker. The rivers also provide cold, clean water for native fish such as westslope cutthroat trout and bull trout. The meandering streams also attract beaver and wood ducks.|$|R
5000|$|The {{northern}} <b>rough-winged</b> <b>swallow</b> usually nest near streams, {{lakes and}} river banks across North America. They nest in cavities near water, usually a burrow in dirt; {{they do not}} usually form colonies. While they do prefer riverbanks, they prefer a drier site than the bank swallow that it is often confused with. The burrows they nest in are usually [...]3 - 1.8 m deep. The nests {{at the end of}} the burrows are usually made with twigs, weeds, bark, and are lined with fine grass. Some of these swallows have been recorded to use small drainage pipes or other artificial cavities as nest sites. They usually nest solitarily or in small groups. They seem to frequently nest on the edge of bank swallow colonies.|$|R
