40|$|Pipelines with {{multiphase}} flow will exhibit large and highly nonlinear liquid rates during transients caused {{by changes in}} production rate. This requires either a large separator (slug catcher) downstream, capable of handling all disturbances, or, some sort of control of the rate change {{in order to ensure}} that the downstream processing equipment can cope with the disturbances. In this report, it is proposed to use <b>smart</b> liquid <b>control</b> to optimally control the production during rate changes. The term <b>smart</b> liquid <b>control</b> was coined to describe the use of nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) and a nonlinear pipeline model to control liquid levels. The pipeline from the Snøhvit field to the Hammerfest LNG plant was used as a test case on which to implement <b>smart</b> liquid <b>control.</b> The technique was proved using a simplified OLGA pipeline model for both predictions and as process, i. e. perfect model. Good results were shown, especially when compared to manual <b>control.</b> <b>Smart</b> liquid <b>control</b> therefore presents a possibility to reduce separator size for new projects. Another highly interesting use of <b>smart</b> liquid <b>control</b> is to optimize the use of separator buffer capacity in order to maximize production. The NMPC method used in this report, a single shooting multistep quasi-Newton method, was elaborated on in a literature review chapter. Also an implementation of the method was made and described in the context of NMPC. The implementation of the algorithm was made in the in-house STATOIL MPC-tool, SEPTIC.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis is to examine how LED street lights and a smart street light control system can reduce the energy consumption, costs and in extension the CO 2 equivalents in a geographically delimited area. In 2015 the municipality of Sala installed LED armatures connected to a <b>smart</b> <b>control</b> system in the whole municipality. The <b>smart</b> <b>control</b> system enables for instance adjustment of the light intensity at specific times {{during the day and}} a supervision of the street light network. The LED lights high efficiency and the possibility to lower the intensity of the light reduced the energy consumption of the street lights in Sala with 77. 8 %. LED lights have a longer life time compared to traditional street lights, which reduces the maintenance cost and the cost for purchasing new armatures. In this report the project in Sala is evaluated and the concept is used to investigate the advantages for a similar project in Uppsala municipality. The research goal is to develop a general model that examines the energy-, economic- and environmental savings when installing LED lights and a <b>smart</b> <b>control</b> system. One third of the armatures in Uppsala municipality have already been replaced with LED, therefore the simulations and calculations only includes the two thirds left. The results show that Uppsala municipality annually saves 79. 2 % in energy and CO 2 equivalents with a system like this and the economic savings during the life time of the armature is 182 MSEK, and the pay-off time is 6. 9 years. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to verify the economic results by altering the electricity price. The analysis shows that the system used in Uppsala today is more sensitive to a varied electricity price than when a <b>smart</b> <b>control</b> system is installed. ...|$|E

Emission savings are calculated under normal operating conditions and under <b>smart</b> <b>control</b> of a flexible heat pump, which includes three strategies: minimal emissions, minimal electricity purchasing cost, and minimal grid interaction. The results illustrate that CO 2 savings by photovoltaics depend heavily on the technologies that are substituted.

In addition, the results suggest strong potential for <b>smart</b> <b>control</b> of heat pumps towards minimal electricity costs and grid interaction, but less potential for control towards additional emission reductions. status: publishe...|$|E
