It is also shown that there exist a pair of optimal stopping rules and <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stochastic game. Most previous work concerning American options, Israeli options, convertible bonds and callable derivatives have required the specific payoff function when either <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issuer</b> or <b>the</b> investor has exercised their options. However, we deal with rather general payoff functions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underlying asset price and the time. We also explore some analytical properties of optimal stopping rules <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>issuer</b> and <b>the</b> investor. Should the payoff function like call or put options be specified, we are eligible to derive specific stopping boundaries for <b>the</b> <b>issuer</b> and <b>the</b> investor, respectively...|$|R
