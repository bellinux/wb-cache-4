GA aircraft are being subject to <b>significant</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> charges, including the imposition of handling fees in some cases. Some airports restrict or deny GA parking, and others limit or refuse certain GA activity. As a result, light GA aircraft are now rarely or never seen at large, busy international airports such as Heathrow, Stansted, Gatwick and Manchester.|$|E

5|$|Its {{by-product}} status {{means that}} indium production is {{constrained by the}} amount of sulfidic zinc (and copper) ores extracted each year. Therefore, its availability needs to be discussed in terms of supply potential. The supply potential of a by-product is defined as that amount which is economically extractable from its host materials per year under current market conditions (i.e. technology and price). Reserves and resources are not relevant for by-products, since they cannot be extracted independently from the main-products. Recent estimates put the supply potential of indium at a minimum of 1,300 t/yr from sulfidic zinc ores and 20 t/yr from sulfidic copper ores. These figures are significantly greater than current production (655 t in 2016). Thus, major future increases in the by-product production of indium will be possible without <b>significant</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> production costs or price. The average indium price in 2016 was $US240/kg, down from $US705/kg in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff {{position}} that Bostock occupied at {{the outbreak of}} World War II was a new one that initially augmented, and later supplanted, an existing Assistant Chief of the Air Staff role. Unlike the Assistant Chief, the Deputy {{had the authority to}} act in place of the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) if required. This increased status saw Bostock given a place on Australia's Joint Planning Committee. He was the RAAF's delegate to a defence conference in Singapore in October 1940, where the Australian contingent found the local forces ill-prepared for an attack by the Japanese, and recommended <b>significant</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> air capability, both in Australia and the Pacific Islands, to meet the threat. Bostock rose rapidly in rank during this period, becoming acting air commodore on 1June 1940 and substantive air vice marshal on 1October 1941. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1942 New Year Honours.|$|E

The Australian contingent found the local forces ill-prepared for an attack by the Japanese and recommended <b>significant</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> air capability, both in Australia and the Pacific Islands, to meet the threat. Hely was promoted to temporary wing commander the following January, and was the ranking Air Force delegate at a series of staff talks in Batavia and Singapore regarding the defence of the Dutch East Indies.

Two days later, the Japanese bombed Darwin, Northern Territory; Hely circulated a memo early the next month to all commands on the lessons learnt from the raid. He was posted to Darwin in May to join North-Western Area headquarters as senior air staff officer, and was granted the temporary rank of group captain in January 1943.

5|$|Although McGregor envisaged the League as a {{friendly}} union, within which clubs would share ticket revenues {{and work together}} in their mutual best interests, the immediate effect of its creation was that football came {{to be treated as}} a business for the first time, as opposed to something that players and officials simply regarded as a pastime. All the clubs involved experienced <b>significant</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> their turnover, which at Aston Villa, McGregor's own club, increased more than sixfold between 1889 and 1899. The wages paid to players, however, remained low due to restrictions imposed by the FA, so clubs were able to use their increased profitability to build larger stadiums and accommodate ever larger crowds of spectators. Although the League initially contained a small number of clubs, all of which were based in the northern half of the country, by {{the early years of the}} twentieth century it included clubs from all parts of England. At its peak nearly 100 clubs played in the Football League, and it remained the pre-eminent competition in English football until the 1990s, when the top clubs broke away to form the Premier League. In keeping with McGregor's views on mutual support and co-operation, gate receipts were shared amongst the clubs until the 1980s, which helped to ensure that a select few wealthy clubs were not able to dominate the competition. McGregor himself had little interest in the business aspect of football, and was adamant that the Football League should not challenge the longstanding authority of the FA. The success of the Football League directly inspired the creation of similar competitions in other countries, beginning with Scotland, where the Scottish Football League was formed in 1890.|$|E

These activities were observed on rodents after 60 days of oral Fluoxetine treatment and were compared with untreated control animals. The results clearly showed that Fluoxetine caused <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> number of head dips in head dip test, <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> number of cage crosses <b>in</b> cage crossing, <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> number of squares crossed in an open field apparatus and <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> struggling time in forced swim test.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTemporomandibular joint (TMJ) {{diseases}} predominantly afflict women, {{suggesting a}} role for female hormones in the disease process. However, {{little is known about}} the role of estrogen receptor (ER) signaling in regulating mandibular condylar cartilage growth. Therefore, the goal of this study was to examine the effects of altered estrogen levels on the mandibular condylar cartilage in wild type (WT) and ER beta Knockout (KO) mice. Materials and methods 21 -day-old female WT (n =  37) and ER beta KO mice (n =  36) were either sham operated or ovariectomized, and treated with either placebo or estradiol. The mandibular condylar cartilage was evaluated by histomorphometry, proliferation was analyzed by double ethynyl- 2 ′-deoxyuridine/bromodeoxyuridine (EdU/BrdU) labeling, and assays on gene and protein expression of chondrocyte maturation markers were performed. ResultsIn WT mice, ovariectomy caused a <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> mandibular condylar cartilage cell numbers, a <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> Sox 9 expression and a <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> proliferation compared with sham operated WT mice. In contrast, ovariectomy did not cause any of these effects in the ER beta KO mice. Estrogen replacement treatment in ovariectomized WT mice caused a significant decrease in ER alpha expression and a <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> Sost expression compared with ovariectomized mice treated with placebo. Estrogen replacement treatment in ovariectomized ER beta KO mice caused a <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> Col 2 expression, no change in ER alpha expression, and a <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> Sost expression. ConclusionEstrogen via ER beta inhibits proliferation and ER alpha expression while estrogen independent of ER beta induces Col 2 and Sost expression...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} blocking the angiotensin II AT- 1 receptor by the systemic administration of candesartan on the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 in the sclera and choroid of hypercholesterolemic rabbits. METHODS: New Zealand rabbits were divided into 3 groups, as follows: GI, which was fed a rabbit standard diet; GII, which was fed a hypercholesterolemic diet; and GIII, which received hypercholesterolemic diet plus candesartan. Samples of the rabbits' sclera and choroid were then studied by hematoxylin-eosin staining and histomorphometric and immunohistochemical analyses for intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 expression. RESULTS: Histological analysis of hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sclera and choroid revealed that macrophages were rarely present in GI, and GII had significantly increased macrophage numbers compared to GIII. Moreover, in GII, the sclera and choroid morphometry showed a <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> thickness in comparison to GI and GIII. GIII presented a <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> thickness in relation to GI.
