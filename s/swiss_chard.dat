25|$|Flavescens Group, <b>swiss</b> <b>chard</b> (Syn. B. v. subsp. v. convar. cicla. var. flavescens) - Chard leaves have {{thick and}} fleshy midribs. Both the midribs and the leaf blades {{are used as}} vegetables, often in {{separate}} dishes. Some cultivars are also grown ornamentally for their coloured midribs. The thickened midribs {{are thought to have}} arisen from the spinach beet by mutation.|$|E
40|$|The uptake {{of metals}} by plants and their {{partitioning}} between different organs {{is an important}} issue in fields like plant ecology, phytochemistry, phytoremediation and, in the case of plants with edible parts, food quality. In this work a five-month field experiment was carried out to investigate the uptake and partitioning of 20 elements (Mg, K, Ca, Na, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Zn, Mo, Sr, Ba, Al, Ti, V, Cr, As, Cd, TI and Pb) by <b>Swiss</b> <b>chards</b> (Beta vulgaris). The effect of the harvesting time on the accumulation of these elements in roots, stalks and leaf blades was studied using plants cultivated in two different but adjacent air-open plots subjected to conventional or organic farming techniques. Plants were collected at six growth stages during their production cycle and samples were analysed by ICP-MS after microwave assisted acid digestion. Toxic elements (except Cd) were mainly immobilised in roots, whereas essential elements were translocated to aboveground organs. In general, the element concentrations in plant organs decreased with time. The use of organic fertilisers promoted the presence of nutrients in blades and stalks. Pb and Cd concentrations in the edible parts were always below the maximum levels set by the European Union...|$|R
40|$|The in vivo {{bioavailability}} of the flavone-C-glycosides {{has been}} little studied compared to their O 30 glycoside analogues, which are both more common in nature and considered more easily 31 hydrolyzed than C-glycosides, by both enterocytes and gut microbiota. In this study, we used 32 vitexin- 2 -O-xyloside (VOX), an apigenin- 8 -C-glucoside- 2 -O-xyloside, purified from seeds of <b>Swiss</b> 33 <b>chard</b> (Beta vulgaris cicla), to investigate VOX absorption into portal blood compared to its 34 aglycone, apigenin. We used a rat model in which we ligated the ileo- and colo-caecal junctions, 35 then administered apigenin or VOX directly into the caecum. Blood samples were drawn from the 36 portal vein at timed intervals over 40 min. The kinetic profile of appearance in portal blood of the 37 compounds and their metabolites was evaluated by HPLC-ESI-MS. Apigenin was found in portal 38 blood both as the aglycone and as an apigenin-glucuronide derivative. The VOX was found 39 unchanged and as a reduced monoglycoside, which underwent glucuronidation. By collecting the 40 bile, we confirmed that the liver received unchanged VOX, which was returned to the gut by 41 enterohepatic recirculation for reabsorption from the ileum. The amount of apigenin and VOX 42 remaining in the caecum accounted for ~ 15 % and ~ 26 %, respectively. These data show for the first 43 time that the C-glycoside VOX is absorbed unchanged and undergoes enterohepatic recirculation in 44 addition to hydrolysis to the monoglycoside, reduction and conjugation to form a bioavailable 45 glucuronide...|$|R
25|$|Vitamin K1 {{is found}} chiefly in leafy green {{vegetables}} such as spinach, <b>swiss</b> <b>chard,</b> lettuce and Brassica vegetables (such as cabbage, kale, cauliflower, broccoli, and brussels sprouts) {{and often the}} absorption is greater when accompanied by fats such as butter or oils. Some fruits, such as avocados, kiwifruit and grapes, are also high in vitamin K. Some vegetable oils, notably soybean oil, contain vitamin K, but at levels that would require relatively large calorie consumption to meet the recommended amounts.|$|E
25|$|Northern Cyprus is {{also well}} known for several dishes; among them are kebabs made of {{skewered}} lamb Şiş Kebab or ground with herbs and spices and made into a Kofte or Şeftali Kebab. Other dishes are based on meat wrapped in flat bread such as Lahmacun. Vegetarians can find stuffed vegetables based dishes Yalancı Dolma or many other dishes made with a bean or pulse such as Börülce which consists of <b>Swiss</b> <b>chard</b> cooked with black-eyed peas. There are also plant based foods such as Molohiya or root based stews such as Kolokas.|$|E
500|$|Stuffed vegetables, called memula’im, were {{originally}} designed to extend cheap ingredients into a meal. They are prepared by cooks in Israel from all ethnic backgrounds and are made with many varying flavors, such as spicy or sweet-and-sour, with ingredients such as bell peppers, chili peppers, figs, onion, artichoke bottoms, <b>Swiss</b> <b>chard,</b> beet, dried fruits, tomato, vine leaves, potatoes, mallow, eggplants and zucchini squash, and stuffing such as meat and rice in Balkan style, bulgur in Middle Eastern fashion, or with ptitim, a type of Israeli pasta. The Ottoman Turks introduced stuffed vine leaves in the 16th century and vine leaves are commonly stuffed {{with a combination of}} meat and rice, although other fillings, such as lentils, have evolved among the various communities. Artichoke bottoms stuffed with meat are famous as one the grand dishes of the Sephardi Jerusalem cuisine of the Old Yishuv.|$|E
2500|$|Sugarbeet root aphids {{have been}} found in North America and Europe. They infect sugarbeets, but also other plants like tablebeets and <b>Swiss</b> <b>chard.</b> Their size has been likened to that of a pinhead, and are pale white-yellow in color. Sugarbeet root aphids have soft bodies that are bulbous in shape, with mandibular parts that can pierce and suck and paired {{abdominal}} tubes that point backwards, and come in both winged and wingless forms.|$|E
2500|$|Because iron from plant {{sources is}} less easily absorbed than the heme-bound iron of animal sources, vegetarians and vegans {{should have a}} {{somewhat}} higher total daily iron intake than those who eat meat, fish or poultry. Legumes and dark-green leafy vegetables like broccoli, kale and oriental greens are especially good sources of iron for vegetarians and vegans. However, spinach and <b>Swiss</b> <b>chard</b> contain oxalates which bind iron, making it almost entirely unavailable for absorption. Iron from non-heme sources is more readily absorbed if consumed with foods that contain either heme-bound iron or vitamin C. This {{is due to a}} hypothesised [...] "meat factor" [...] which enhances iron absorption.|$|E
2500|$|Non-dairy milks {{that are}} {{fortified}} with calcium, such as soymilk and almond milk can also contribute {{a significant amount}} of calcium in the diet. [...] The calcium found in broccoli, bok choy, and kale have also been found to have calcium that is well absorbed in the body. [...] Though the calcium content per serving is lower in these vegetables than a glass of milk, the absorption of the calcium into the body is higher. [...] Other [...] foods that contain calcium include calcium-set tofu, blackstrap molasses, turnip greens, mustard greens, soybeans, tempeh, almonds, okra, dried figs, and tahini. Though calcium can be found in Spinach, <b>swiss</b> <b>chard,</b> beans and beet greens, they are generally not considered to be a good source since the calcium binds to oxalic acid and is poorly absorbed into the body. [...] Phytic acid found in nuts, seeds, and beans may also impact calcium absorption rates. [...] See the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements for calcium needs for various ages, the Vegetarian Resource Group and the Vegetarian Nutrition Calcium Fact Sheet from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics [...] for more specifics on how to obtain adequate calcium intake on a vegetarian or vegan diet.|$|E
