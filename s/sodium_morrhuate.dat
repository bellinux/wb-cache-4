50|$|Patients {{receiving}} prolotherapy injections {{have reported}} generally mild side effects, including mild pain and irritation at the injection site (often within 72 {{hours of the}} injection), numbness at the injection site, or mild bleeding. Pain from prolotherapy injections is temporary and is often treated with acetaminophen or, in rare cases, opioid medications. NSAIDs are not usually recommended due to their counter action to prolotherapy-induced inflammation, but are occasionally used in patients with pain refractory to other methods of pain control. Theoretical adverse events of prolotherapy injection include lightheadedness, allergic reactions to the agent used, bruising, infection, or nerve damage. Allergic reactions to <b>sodium</b> <b>morrhuate</b> are rare.

30|$|An {{animal model}} of acute peri-implant {{osteomyelitis}} was modified for this study. The model {{relies on the}} use of a sclerosing agent, <b>sodium</b> <b>morrhuate,</b> to promote the development of infection. The use of <b>sodium</b> <b>morrhuate</b> for the promotion of osteomyelitis has been criticized [30],[31]. For example, in a previous report, histological examination, performed 2  weeks postoperatively, detected a slight increase in the periosteal bone formation in rat tibias treated with <b>sodium</b> <b>morrhuate</b> [32]. The bone repair process, which follows the aseptic bone necrosis caused by the sclerosing agent, could be misinterpreted in diagnostic imaging, especially at the early stages after inoculation [30]. Despite this drawback, the animal model with <b>sodium</b> <b>morrhuate</b> pretreatment is considered robust and reproducible [31]. Therefore, it has been frequently applied in the studies involving diagnostic imaging without an animal group dedicated to the assessment of the effect of <b>sodium</b> <b>morrhuate</b> alone [16],[27],[32]-[34]. The virulence of slime-producing S. epidermidis strains can be so low that even the use of aqueous <b>sodium</b> <b>morrhuate</b> does not guarantee the induction of bone infection. In our previous experiment [16], using a rabbit model with a small block of bone cement as the foreign body and use of adjunct <b>sodium</b> <b>morrhuate,</b> we observed that a standard slime-producing laboratory S. epidermidis strain (ATCC 35983) induced only occasionally culture-positive bone infections, while the clinically retrieved S. epidermidis strain (T- 54580) produced infection in a reliable manner. In this study, we cannot exclude the possibility that <b>sodium</b> <b>morrhuate</b> caused inflammation on its own and acted as a confounding factor. However, the lack of statistically significant differences in the tracer uptake between S. aureus group with <b>sodium</b> <b>morrhuate</b> pretreatment and the sterile implant group without <b>sodium</b> <b>morrhuate</b> pretreatment suggests that the effect of the sclerosing agent is marginal.|$|E

The granules were prepared in solution and consisted of nanohydroxyapatite (nHA), chitosan (CS) and GM loaded ethyl cellulose (EC) microspheres. A rabbit model with chronic osteomyelitis was made by using staphylococcus aureus and <b>morrhuate</b> <b>sodium</b> and special inspection methods were used to test the curative effects of the granules, such as microbiological investigations, tissue, and X-ray observations. The granules were provided with excellent drug release properties, 49 days in vitro and 45 days in vivo, moreover, they showed almost no cytotoxic for fibroblast and osteoblast. The findings indicated that the GM-impregnated CS/nHA/EC microspheres granules showed outstanding curative effect.

In earlier studies by our laboratory, we found that this model was highly reproducible with histological changes similar to those observed in humans with chronic osteomyelitis (Patel et al. 2000; Rouse et al. 2006). Animals were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine and the proximal third of the medial left tibia surgically exposed. A 0.5 mm hole was drilled into the medullary cavity. Fifty microliters of <b>morrhuate</b> <b>sodium</b> (a sclerosing agent) was injected into the cavity, followed by 50 μl sterile saline containing 107 colony forming units (cfu) of MRSA IDRL- 4293.

30|$|Before {{the samples}} were analyzed, the {{experimental}} animal model was rigorously studied and tested for its effectiveness in reproducing an early infection scenario. Different osteomyelitis experimental models have been proposed in the bibliography {{using a variety of}} strategies and agents to induce osseous infection. As an example, authors used <b>morrhuate</b> <b>sodium</b> or its derivative arachidonic acid to induce aseptic osseous necrosis, which is an ideal situation for bacterial proliferation [36]. The insertion of foreign bodies provides a surface for bacterial adhesion and further biofilm formation, resulting in an increase in bacterial resistance to the host defenses [37]. The bibliography also shows studies with different materials—osseous cement [38], osteosynthetic materials such as needles and nails [39], and osseous wax [40]. This latter substance and osseous cement are also employed to seal the hole created in the bone to avoid the overflow of the inoculum and the formation of abscesses in surrounding soft tissues. Other authors have induced thermal osseous necrosis by electrocauterization or by using drills to open the intramedullar channel of the bone [41]. Our animal model avoided the use of sclerosing agents, drilling to open the femur channel and osseous wax to seal the femur hole, with the objective of isolating the effect of the titanium surface as a foreign body to induce osteomyelitis.|$|R
30|$|For surgery, {{the animals}} were anesthetized by {{subcutaneous}} injections of a mixture of ketamine hydrochloride (Ketaminol® vet 50  mg/mL, Intervet International B.V., Boxmeer, the Netherlands) and medetomidine hydrochloride (Cepetor vet 1  mg/mL, CP-Pharma Handelsges. mbH, Burgdorf, Germany). Skin preparation involved careful shaving, disinfection with chlorhexidine, and surgical draping. The anterior part of the proximal right tibia was exposed through a short skin incision, and a small cortical bone hole was made next to the patellar tendon insertion using an injection needle. An intravenous catheter made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) (BD VenflonTM, Becton Dickinson Infusion Therapy, Helsingborg, Sweden) with the diameter of 1  mm was introduced into the medullary canal. The bacterial suspension was injected into the medullary cavity through the catheter. The group 1 rats received 0.05  mL solution of 3 [*]×[*] 108  CFU/mL of S. epidermidis. Before the inoculation, a volume of 0.05  mL of 5 % wt/vol. <b>sodium</b> <b>morrhuate</b> (Scleromate, Glenwood, Englewood, NJ, USA) was injected via the catheter. <b>Sodium</b> <b>morrhuate</b> is a sclerosing agent, composed of fatty acids and arachidonic acids, producing aseptic bone necrosis and increasing the probability of local bone infection. The animals of group 2 received equal 0.05  mL injections of S. aureus suspension (3 [*]×[*] 105  CFU/mL) and aqueous <b>sodium</b> <b>morrhuate.</b> In group 3, no bacteria or aqueous <b>sodium</b> <b>morrhuate</b> were injected, but {{an equal amount of}} sterile saline was injected via the catheter into the medullary canal. Subsequently, the catheter was cut {{at the site of the}} cortical bone entry and the intramedullary portion of the catheter was left in situ. The wound was closed in layers. The anesthesia was reversed by subcutaneous injection of atipamezole hydrochloride (Antisedan 5  mg/mL, Orion Oyj, Espoo, Finland). During and after the surgery, the hypothermia of the animals was prevented using heating pads. Standard postoperative pain medication of buprenorphine (Temgesic® 0.3  mg/mL, PB Pharmaceuticals Limited, Slough, Berkshire, UK) was given subcutaneously for 3  days after the surgery. After the surgery, the functional activity of the animals was not restricted.|$|E
30|$|Thirty {{adult male}} rats were {{randomized}} into three groups.

The animals of group 2 received equal injections of aqueous <b>sodium</b> <b>morrhuate</b> and biofilm-inducing S. aureus suspension. In group 3, {{an equal amount of}} sterile saline was injected via the sterile catheter. Two weeks after surgery, PET/CT imaging with 68 Ga-DOTA-Siglec- 9 tracer was performed. The in vivo PET results were verified by ex vivo measurements of both tibias. The presence of inoculated staphylococcal infections and the absence of contamination in the group with sterile catheters were verified by separate microbiological analyses of bone specimens and retrieved catheters. The presence of microbial biofilms on catheters was verified ex vivo with fluorescence microscopy. Histological inflammatory reactions were graded using a scoring system.|$|E

30|$|The {{localized}} S. aureus osteomyelitis model (stage IIIA in Cierny-Mader classification) {{was modified}} {{from that of}} Koort et al. [16], and the foreign-body-associated infection model was adopted from that of Mayberry-Carson et al. [17]. The animals were sedated by a subcutaneous injection of midazolam. Anesthesia was induced and maintained by subcutaneous injections of fentanyl citrate-fluanisone. Using an anteromedial surgical approach, a cortical bone window (6 [*]mm[*]×[*] 2.7 [*]mm) was drilled into the proximal medial metaphysis of the left tibia using a high-speed trephine drill bit under saline cooling. Bone marrow was removed with saline lavage. A small block of sterile pre-polymerized pre-shaped bone cement (Palacos R- 40, Schering-Plough Europe) was transplanted into the medullary canal. The periosteal layer was sutured over the cortical window, and a volume of 0.1 [*]mL inoculum of S. aureus (105 [*]CFU/mL) {{or one of the}} two strains of S. epidermidis (109 [*]CFU/mL) was injected into the medullary space next to the cement block. The selected doses of the staphylococcal strains were different due to the differences of bacterial virulence. The necessary dose for induction of S. aureus osteomyelitis is low due to the high virulence of the pathogen. The necessary dose for induction of S. epidermidis infection is much higher due to the low virulence of the strain. The animals inoculated with S. epidermidis also received a local injection of 0.1 [*]mL of aqueous <b>sodium</b> <b>morrhuate</b> (5 [*]% wt/vol) (Scleromate, Glenwood, Englewood, NJ, 07631, USA) for induction of local bone necrosis and to promote the development of the infectious process. The relatively low inoculation dose of S. aureus 52 / 52 A/ 80 was adopted from our previous experiment [16]. Development of experimental S. aureus osteomyelitis does not require an adjunct use of <b>sodium</b> <b>morrhuate.</b> The inoculation dose of S. epidermidis strains was selected based on a pilot study (three animals). The 109 [*]CFU/mL dose was found to induce culture positive infection in the model without adverse effects on the animal well-being. The dose was the highest tested, and it also represented the maximum dose of CFU per milliliter producing viable bacteria. The soft tissues were rinsed with sterile saline before wound closure. An intramuscular injection of naloxone was given to reverse the anesthesia. After surgery, the animals received standard postoperative pain medication (4 [*]mg/kg of carprofen) for three postoperative days. Functional activity was not limited within individual cages.|$|E
40|$|A {{surgical}} procedure allowed {{the placement of}} a silicone rubber catheter in the marrow cavity of the tibia of a rabbit and also allowed {{the introduction of a}} sclerosing agent (<b>sodium</b> <b>morrhuate)</b> and cells of Staphylococcus aureus. Osteomyelitis developed in 60 % of the animals so treated, and the infecting microorganism was recovered from the infected tibias of the animals that developed this disease. All blood cultures taken 24 h after the infection were negative for S. aureus. Radiological findings consisted of osteolytic changes, the occurrence of sequestration and periosteal reactions, and sclerosis in the infected bones. Sections of bone prepared for histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of osteomyelitis. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy of samples of bone marrow, bone chips, and the catheters taken from the infected tibiae revealed gram-positive cocci embedded in a very extensive matrix of ruthenium red-staining glycocalyx adhering to the bone and the implanted catheter.

Zipper, of Santiago, Chile, has worked extensively with quinacrine and his technique has finally evolved into the quinacrine pellet concept discussed in Chapters 9 and 10. EVOLUTION OF IUD DELIVERY SYSTEMS As our interest in the further development of the concept of chemical sterilization with quinacrine was pursued, we realized that we must determine the exact pathologic changes induced by quinacrine. In 1980, Bhatt and associates reported on the quinacrine-induced pathologic changes in fallopian tubes. ’ This limited study was accomplished by inserting one application of 250 mg quinacrine pellets into the uterine cavity of 23 women awaiting hysterectomies; therefore, 46 tubes were studied. The changes induced by quinacrine were documented, and in about 50 % of the cases an obstructive lesion commensurate with tubal closure was induced. As a result of this study, a concept was developed to provide a better delivery system of quinacrine to attempt to ensure a more accurate application of the drug to the tubal ostia and to reduce the delivery system to a single event. At that time, studies were initiated using the IUD as a vector for delivering quinacrine.

40|$|BackgroundUltrasound-guided foam {{sclerotherapy}} is {{a generally}} safe, cost-effective, and practical technique {{for the treatment}} of certain venous malformations; however, not all vascular malformation lesions are amenable to the ultrasound-guided method. Venous outflow of the sclerosing agent and extravasation are difficult to check when only ultrasound guidance is used. This study describes a new fluoroscopy-guided technique that uses standardized sclerosing foam for peripheral venous malformations. The short-term efficacy and safety of fluoroscopy-guided foam sclerotherapy for peripheral venous malformations was evaluated. MethodsA retrospective review of a prospectively collected data was performed for 23 patients (9 males, 14 females) with limited (localized) venous malformations treated with foam sclerotherapy who were referred from January 2007 to December 2007. Median patient age was 21 years (range, 5 months- 39 years). Lesion locations included extremities in 13, faces in eight, and trunks in two. The standardized sclerosing foam was prepared using Tessari's method to mix room air with 5 % <b>sodium</b> <b>morrhuate</b> in a 4 : 1 ratio. Sclerotherapy was performed by the “filling-defects” technique under fluoroscopy. Postsclerotherapy surveillance was done at 6 months after the last session. Treatment response was assessed clinically and by means of lesion size measurement with magnetic resonance imaging. During the treatment and the follow-up period, adverse events and adverse drug reactions were recorded. Specific complications were classified as major or minor. ResultsA total of 58 treatment sessions were performed (mean, 3 sessions per patient; range, 1 - 6 sessions). At the 6 -month follow-up, 15 patients (65. 2 %) showed a total disappearance of treated malformations, six (26. 1 %) showed a reduction in malformation size of > 50 %, and two (8. 7 %) showed a reduction in malformation size of ≤ 50 %. The overall patient-reported outcome was excellent in 11 (47. 8 %), good in 8 (34. 8 %), or moderate in 4 (17. 4 %). Minor complications included swelling and inflammatory reaction per session, mild pain in 17 sessions (29. 3 %), and skin blister at the injection site in two sessions (3. 4 %), which resolved spontaneously within several days to 2 weeks. No major complications occurred.
