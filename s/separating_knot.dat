We present a computer simulation on a lattice of a closed, knotted, charged DNA chain drifting in an external electric field in a topologically restricted medium.

The broad-band UBVRIJHKs photometry is {{used to determine the}} global spectral energy distribution (SED) of the host galaxy. Comparison with that of known galaxy types shows that the host is similar to a moderately reddened starburst galaxy with a young stellar population. The estimated internal extinction in the host is Av= 0. 15 +/- 0. 1 and the star-formation rate (SFR) from the UV continuum is 1. 3 +/- 0. 3 M_sun/yr, (not corrected for the effects of extinction).

Stacks of digital images of the internal structure of the logs were obtained through computed tomography.

The reconstructed boards were inspected by three operators who independently mapped the heartwood/sapwood boundaries using an image manipulation program.

Observations of H 2, [Fe II] and [C I] are used to constrain shock model parameters and determine {{the origin of the}} emission. Previous work has shown that {{it is likely that the}} atomic and ionic emission arises in regions of higher ionization than the molecular emission. On the basis of observations, it has often been suggested that the [Fe II] and [C I] emission could arise, for example, at the apex of a bow shock, with the H 2 emission produced in the wings. Accordingly, we have combined models of C-component and J-type shocks in order to reproduce the observed H 2, [Fe II] and [C I] line spectra. We can account for the H 2 emission towards the HH 99 B complex by means of J-type shocks with magnetic precursors. We derive shock velocities of about 30 km s- 1 and ages of order 100 yr; the pre-shock gas has a density of approximately 10 ^ 4 cm- 3 and the magnetic field is approximately 100 mu G. The J-type shocks required to reproduce the intensities of the observed [Fe II] and [C I] lines have velocities of 50 km s- 1. It is necessary to assume that Fe has been previously eroded from grains, probably by the earlier passage of a C-type shock wave. Thus, our analysis supports the view that molecular outflows are episodic phenomena whose observed emission arises in shock waves. Comment: 13 pages, 8 figures. MNRAS, in pres...|$|R

40|$|A unique peptide toxin, named double-knot toxin (DkTx), was {{recently}} purified from the venom of the tarantula Ornithoctonus huwena {{and was found}} to stably activate TRPV 1 channels by targeting the outer pore domain. DkTx {{has been shown to}} consist of two inhibitory cysteine-knot (ICK) motifs, referred to as K 1 and K 2, each containing six cysteine residues. Beyond this initial characterization, however, the structural and functional details about DkTx remains elusive in large part {{due to the lack of}} a high yielding methodology for the synthesis and folding of this cysteine-rich peptide. Here, we overcome this obstacle by generating pure DkTx in quantities sufficient for structural and functional analyses. Our methodology entails expression of DkTx in E. coli followed by oxidative folding of the isolated linear peptide. Upon screening of various oxidative conditions for optimizing the folding yield of the toxin, we observed that detergents were required for efficient folding of the linear peptide. Our synthetic DkTx co-eluted with the native toxin on HPLC, and irreversibly activated TRPV 1 in a manner identical to native DkTx.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{concern about the}} world’s animal migrations. With many land-use andclimatological changes occurring simultaneously, pinning down the causes of large-scale conservationproblems requires sophisticated and data-intensive approaches. 2. Declining shorebird numbers along the East Asian–Australasian Flyway, in combinationwith data on habitat loss along the Yellow Sea (where these birds refuel during long-distancemigrations), indicate a flyway under threat. 3. If habitat loss at staging areas indeed leads to flyway-wide bird losses, we would predictthat: (i) decreases in survival only occur during the season that birds use the Yellow Sea, and(ii) decreases in survival occur in migrants that share a reliance on the vanishing intertidalflats along the Yellow Sea, even if ecologically distinct and using different breeding grounds. 4. Monitored from 2006 – 2013, we analysed seasonal apparent survival patterns of threeshorebird species with non-overlapping Arctic breeding areas and considerable differences inforaging ecology, but a shared use of both north-west Australian non-breeding grounds andthe Yellow Sea coasts to refuel during northward and southward migrations (red knot Calidriscanutus piersmai, great knot Calidris tenuirostris, bar-tailed godwit Limosa lapponicamenzbieri). Distinguishing two three-month non-breeding periods and a six-month migrationand breeding period, and analysing survival of the three species and the three seasons in asingle model, we statistically evaluated differences at both the species and season levels. 5. Whereas apparent survival remained high in north-west Australia, during the time awayfrom the non-breeding grounds survival in all three species began to decline in 2011, havinglost 20 percentage points by 2012. By 2012 annual apparent survival had become as low as 0 ? 71 in bar-tailed godwits, 0 ? 68 in great knots and 0 ? 67 in red <b>knots.</b> In a <b>separate</b> analysisfor red <b>knots,</b> no mortality occurred during the migration from Australia to China.

40|$|The {{trend in}} recent years has been that the amount of wild catch is stagnating. In this {{perspective}} the selectivity of fishing gear has become an important issue. The aim of the present work has been to develop a three-dimensional model for the flow in front and inside a net structure, such as a trawl, to be able to predict and calculate selectivity of net structures. A net consist of twines which connect in knots and make up a mesh. The diameter of a twine can be from 1 [mm] in net cages up to a few centimeters in the front part of a trawl. And similar the size of the mesh can be from 1 [cm] up to the order of a meter. Typical Reynolds number range, related to the diameter of a twine, is O(10 2 − 10 4). An examination of numerical results for the drag force on plane net structure demonstrates a strong dependency of the drag force on a net structure with both the geometry, in terms of Solidity ratio, and the Reynolds number. And in particular a non-uniform relation between the drag force and the Solidity ratio. It is evident that for increasing Solidity ratios, flow interaction will become increasingly significant. The physical design of the knot part contributes largely to this flow interaction. The net structure is divided into discrete elements. The twines are modeled as <b>separate</b> cylinders between <b>knots</b> and the knots are modeled as separate spheres. Typically the total number of twines in a trawl could be in the order of 10 6 and it is thus impractical to model every single twine. It is assumed that for a given Reynolds number, keeping the Solidity ratio constant, the total drag on the trawl will be independent on the actual diameter and mesh opening of the net. First each of these different elements is modeled as a set of source distributions and single point sources. The influence from the net on the fluid flow is then calculated by representing the wake generated by each element as source distributions along the structural element. To determine the strength of these sources the principle of Lagally is applied. Then a set of equations is obtained, describing the relation between the fluid velocity and the source strength at every element. Based on this approach, a method is presented to calculate the drag force on net structures with high solidity. The method uses appropriate drag coefficients related to the geometry of the twines and the knots and account for the change in the inflow due to the presence of the net structure and at the same time changes the geometry of the net structure due to the load. Secondly the interaction between the net elements, due to the physical generation of a wake flow behind each individual element of the net, has been studied using a time-averaged wake model. Modifications are applied to the far-field mean velocity deficit mode by Schlichting (1968). This to better describe the the near-field behavior and the added effect of the wake from many individual cylindrical elements. It is shown that the wake model by Blevins (1990) can be used. The method is verified against experiments, as means of calculating the drag on plane nets as a function of Reynolds number, Solidity ratio and angle of attack and gives reasonable good agreement. During the experiments some interesting three-dimensional effects regarding the flow around cylinders were discovered. Negative lift forces occurring on the downstream cylinder in a staggered arrangement is explained as interactions due to upstream generated vortices. To create a three-dimensional method where the inflow on each of the cylinders is corrected due to the presence of all the other cylinders, these two models are added together. Further, a structural analysis of the net structure, using a FEM method, is included in the model. A more complete description of the problem is obtained by combining the change in the inflow due to the presence of the net structure, with a correction of the shape and geometry due to the drag load. Results from numerical simulation of different kinds of net structures, show that the elasticity in the net structure has a significant influence on the resulting geometry and calculated results. Further, the numerical results for net cages have been compared to experimental results. Good agreement between the numerical results and the experimental result is seen. Also the resulting geometry from the experimental results was recreated satisfactory using the present method. For three-dimensional cone shaped net structures, in contrast to net panels and net cages, the presented numerical results do not indicate a large influence on the drag force due to changes in geometry. The agreement between the numerical and experimental results for fluid velocity in front and inside of a three-dimensional net structure, compared to experimental results, was reasonably good. Quantitatively the results do not match exactly, but the characteristics of the flow are recreated. Further, based on the numerical results for the fluid velocity, pressure field in front of a cone is presented. The relative pressure gradient is shown to be minimal, and it is not likely than any fish will detect this change in pressure field neither by direct pressure sensing nor by any sound created from any shed vortices. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
