5|$|From these models, {{researchers}} also predict that bee populations will start declining most {{significantly in the}} southern latitudes with lagging range expansion in the north. Kerr and his colleagues found that as the climate has shifted, bumblebees {{have been forced to}} operate outside of their thermal ranges, causing range losses along the species’ southern limits. However, the study also found that while other flora and fauna have expanded their northerly ranges to account for the climate <b>shifts,</b> bumblebees have not expanded farther north. The most important findings in this study came from statistical models built to study whether or not these range <b>shifts</b> were due to confounding factors such as pesticide use or changes in land cover. The researchers found that climate change had the most meaningful impact on range <b>shifts</b> and bee distributions. To support these findings, the scientists note that failure for the bumblebee to respond to thermal changes and expand their northern range underscores the idea that bumblebees are susceptible to climate change.|$|E
