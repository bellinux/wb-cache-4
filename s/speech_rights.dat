5|$|The Communist Party USA was {{routinely}} harassed and {{oppressed by}} government officials, leading {{it to be}} the primary client of the ACLU. The Communists were very aggressive in their tactics, often engaging in illegal or unethical conduct, and this led to frequent conflicts between the Communists and ACLU. Communist leaders often attacked the ACLU, particularly when the ACLU defended the free <b>speech</b> <b>rights</b> of conservatives. This uneasy relationship between the two groups continued for decades.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{was founded}} in 1920 by Helen Keller, Roger Baldwin, Crystal Eastman, Walter Nelles, Morris Ernst, Albert DeSilver, Arthur Garfield Hays, Jane Addams, Felix Frankfurter, and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, and its focus was on freedom of speech, {{primarily}} for anti-war protesters. During the 1920s, the ACLU expanded its scope to include protecting the free <b>speech</b> <b>rights</b> of artists and striking workers, {{and working with the}} National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to decrease racism and discrimination. During the 1930s, the ACLU started to engage in work combating police misconduct and supporting Native American rights. Many of the ACLU's cases involved the defense of Communist party members and Jehovah's Witnesses. In 1940, the ACLU leadership voted to exclude Communists from its leadership positions, a decision rescinded in 1968. During World War II, the ACLU defended Japanese-American citizens, unsuccessfully trying to prevent their forcible relocation to internment camps. During the Cold War, the ACLU headquarters was dominated by anti-Communists, but many local affiliates defended members of the Communist Party.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} legal {{scholars}} {{who support the}} outcome of the ruling nonetheless criticize the Supreme Court's approach to Beck's First Amendment challenge.

25|$|The {{positions}} of Women Against Pornography were controversial.

25|$|The {{majority}} {{ruled that}} the Freedom of the Press clause of the First Amendment protects associations of individuals in addition to individual speakers, and further that the First Amendment does not allow prohibitions of speech based on {{the identity of the}} speaker.
