5|$|Colonists {{near the}} shores in New England often dined on fish, {{crustaceans}} and other sea animals. Colonists ate {{large quantities of}} turtle, a delicacy also exportable to Europe. Cod was enjoyed in both fresh and <b>salted</b> form, <b>salted</b> cod being suitable for long-term storage. Lobsters proliferated in the waters as well, and were commonplace in the New England diet. Some complained about dining on lobster and codfish too often and they were even used as pig fodder. The highest quality cod was usually dried and <b>salted,</b> however, and exported to the Mediterranean in exchange for fruits not grown in American colonies.|$|E

50|$|<b>Salt</b> cellars are known, {{in various}} forms, by {{assorted}} names including open <b>salt,</b> <b>salt</b> dip, standing <b>salt,</b> master <b>salt,</b> and <b>salt</b> dish. A master <b>salt</b> {{is the large}} receptacle from which the smaller, distributed, <b>salt</b> dishes are filled; according to fashion or custom it was lidded, or open, or covered with a cloth. A standing <b>salt</b> is a master <b>salt,</b> so-named because it remained in place {{as opposed to being}} passed. A trencher <b>salt</b> is a small <b>salt</b> cellar located next to the trencher (i.e., place setting). Open <b>salt</b> and <b>salt</b> dip refer to <b>salt</b> dishes that are uncovered.|$|R
40|$|Cod <b>salting</b> is a {{long process}} on which mass transfer, {{basically}} <b>salt</b> and water, occurs by diffusion. This work analyses and compares cod <b>salting</b> kinetics by using different <b>salting</b> techniques: brine <b>salting,</b> with and without applying a vacuum pulse and dry <b>salting</b> with and without pressure. The results revealed that mass transfer kinetics during cod <b>salting</b> process seemed {{to be affected by}} the <b>salting</b> method applied. Osmotic mechanism and diffusion transport of <b>salt</b> can be enhanced during vacuum pulsed brine <b>salting,</b> also leading to a lower water loss and higher yield. During dry <b>salting,</b> the coupling of osmotic mechanism and suctioning effect due to dry <b>salt</b> crystals (moreover in the case of pressured dry <b>salting)</b> favoured water losses and limited <b>salt</b> gain.

5|$|Filipino cuisine {{has evolved}} over several centuries from its Malayo-Polynesian origins to become a mixed cuisine with many Hispanic, Chinese, American, and other Asian {{influences}} that have been adapted to local ingredients and the Filipino palate to create distinctively Filipino dishes.

2500|$|In 1835, the Government {{appointed}} a <b>salt</b> commission {{to review the}} existing <b>salt</b> tax. It recommended that Indian <b>salt</b> should be taxed to enable the sale of imported English <b>salt.</b> Consequently, <b>salt</b> was imported from Liverpool, resulting in the increase of <b>salt</b> rates. Subsequently, the Government set up a monopoly on the manufacture of <b>salt</b> by the <b>Salt</b> Act. Production of <b>salt</b> was made an offense punishable with six months' imprisonment. The committee also recommended that Indian <b>salt</b> be sold in maunds of 100. However, they were sold in much lesser quantities. In 1888, the <b>salt</b> tax was enhanced by Lord Dufferin as a temporary measure. Cheshire <b>salt</b> imported from the United Kingdom was available at a much cheaper rate. However, Cheshire <b>salt</b> was of an inferior quality compared to India's <b>salt.</b> India's <b>salt</b> imports reached [...] metric tons by 1851.|$|R
5|$|After {{approximately}} three weeks, the expedition arrived in Lambaréné {{and met with}} Albert Schweitzer.

Later, the hospital received 500kg of Norwegian klippfisk (dried and <b>salted</b> cod), a particular favourite with the hospital's patients. The medicines were handed over, and the container was opened. Even though the drainage had been monitored throughout the expedition, there was still great excitement associated with seeing the result firsthand.

5|$|Egyptian cuisine {{remained}} remarkably stable over time; indeed, {{the cuisine}} of modern Egypt retains some striking similarities to the cuisine of the ancients. The staple diet consisted {{of bread and}} beer, supplemented with vegetables such as onions and garlic, and fruit such as dates and figs. Wine and meat were enjoyed by all on feast days while the upper classes indulged on a more regular basis. Fish, meat, and fowl could be <b>salted</b> or dried, and could be cooked in stews or roasted on a grill.|$|E
5|$|Fried {{butter is}} a similar dish, for which recipes exist dating to the 17th century. The first known recipe for fried butter dates to 1615. Fried butter was {{documented}} in the cookbook The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy in 1747. The recipe entailed soaking butter in <b>salted</b> water for a few hours, placing it on a rotisserie ("spit it"), covering it with breadcrumbs and nutmeg, and roasting it under a low fire while continuously covering it with egg yolks and additional bread crumbs. Oysters were recommended to accompany the dish.|$|E

50|$|This led {{to three}} types of <b>salt</b> {{production}} all of which used {{a variation of the}} open-pan <b>salt</b> method: Coastal <b>salt</b> production.

5|$|Halfbeaks {{are not a}} major {{target for}} {{commercial}} fisheries, though small fisheries for them exist in some places, for example in South Australia where fisheries target the southern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus melanochir). and the eastern sea garfish (Hyporhamphus australis). Halfbeaks are caught {{by a variety of}} methods including seines and pelagic trawls, dip-netting under lights at night, and with haul nets. They are utilized fresh, dried, smoked, or <b>salted,</b> and they are considered good eating. However, even where halfbeaks are targeted by fisheries, they tend to be of secondary importance compared with other edible fish species.|$|E
5|$|In Russia, {{blackcurrant}} leaves may be {{used for}} flavouring tea or preserves, such as <b>salted</b> cucumbers, and berries for home winemaking. Sweetened vodka may also be infused with blackcurrant leaves making a deep greenish-yellow beverage with a tart flavour and astringent taste. The berries may be infused in a similar manner. In Britain, 95% of the blackcurrants grown end up in Ribena (a brand of fruit juice whose name is derived from Ribes nigrum) and similar fruit syrups and juices.|$|E
5|$|Meat {{was more}} {{expensive}} and therefore more prestigious. Game, a form of meat acquired from hunting, was common only on the nobility's tables. The most prevalent butcher's meats were pork, chicken and other domestic fowl; beef, which required greater investment in land, was less common. Cod and herring were mainstays among the northern populations; dried, smoked or <b>salted</b> {{they made their way}} far inland, but a wide variety of other saltwater and freshwater fish was also eaten.|$|E

5|$|The {{trade with}} the North German towns lasted until the 1707 Act of Union, when high salt duties {{prevented}} the German merchants from trading with Shetland.
