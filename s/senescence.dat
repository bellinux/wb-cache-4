5|$|Asexual {{reproduction}} {{offers the}} benefits of high reproductive rate, delaying <b>senescence,</b> and replacement of dead modules, as well as geographical distribution.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{opportunities}} for the applications of RNAi in crop science for its improvement such as stress tolerance and enhanced nutritional level. RNAi will prove its potential for inhibition of photorespiration to enhance the productivity of C3 plants. This knockdown technology {{may be useful in}} inducing early flowering, delayed ripening, delayed <b>senescence,</b> breaking dormancy, stress-free plants, overcoming self-sterility, etc.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of her {{grandson}} in August 1963, Calment lived on her own from age 88 until shortly before her 110th birthday, when she decided to move to a nursing home. Her move was precipitated by the winter of 1985 which froze the water pipes in her house (she never used heating in the winter) and caused frostbite in her hands. According to one of her doctors, she had hitherto been healthy but began showing signs of <b>senescence</b> (or aging) at this point.|$|E
5|$|Because of its higher {{susceptibility}} {{and lower}} reliance on fire for reproduction, the optimal fire interval for B.prionotes {{is higher than}} for other Banksia species with which it occurs. One simulation suggested an interval of 18 years was optimal for B.prionotes, compared to 15 years for B.hookeriana and 11 years for B.attenuata. The same model suggested that B.prionotes is quite susceptible to reductions in fire intervals. On the other hand, it shows little susceptibility to increases in fire interval: although <b>senescence</b> and death are often observed in plants older than about 30 years, healthy stands have been observed that have escaped fire for 50 years. These stands have a multi-aged structure, demonstrating the occurrence of successful inter-fire recruitment.|$|E
5|$|Of these viruses {{the most}} serious and {{prevalent}} are NDV, NYSV and NWSV. NDV is associated with chlorotic leaf striping in N. tazetta. Infection with NYSV produces light or grayish green, or yellow stripes or mottles on the upper two-thirds of the leaf, which may be roughened or twisted. The flowers which may be smaller than usual may also be streaked or blotched. NWSV produces greenish-purple streaking on the leaves and stem turning white to yellow, and premature <b>senescence</b> reducing bulb size and yield. These viruses are primarily diseases of commercial nurseries. The growth inhibition caused by viral infection can cause substantial economic damage.|$|E
5|$|The 400-year {{period from}} the 9th to 13th centuries AD was the Islamic Renaissance, {{a time when}} Islamic culture and science thrived. Greco-Roman texts were preserved, copied and {{extended}} although new texts always emphasised the medicinal aspects of plants. Kurdish biologist Ābu Ḥanīfah Āḥmad ibn Dawūd Dīnawarī (828–896 AD) {{is known as the}} founder of Arabic botany; his Kitâb al-nabât (‘Book of Plants’) describes 637 species, discussing plant development from germination to <b>senescence</b> and including details of flowers and fruits. The Mutazilite philosopher and physician Ibn Sina (Avicenna) (c. 980–1037 AD) was another influential figure, his The Canon of Medicine being a landmark in the history of medicine treasured until the Enlightenment.|$|E
5|$|Two {{conflicting}} {{factors are}} involved in host preferences, the species {{and the age of}} the leaf. Offered spindle and beet leaves on growing plants throughout the year, winged aphids moved {{from one to the other}} depending on the active growth state of each and the <b>senescence</b> of each host plant. Thus in late summer and autumn, the beet leaves were old and unattractive to the aphids in comparison with the leaves of the spindle, whereas in spring, the young unfolding leaves of the beet were more attractive than those of the spindle.|$|E
5|$|Yet another {{trait that}} sets most lemurs apart from anthropoid {{primates}} is their long lifespan {{together with their}} high infant mortality. Many lemurs, including the ring-tailed lemur, have adapted to a highly seasonal environment, which has affected their birthrate, maturation, and twinning rate (r-selection). This helps them to recover rapidly from a population crash. In captivity, lemurs can live {{twice as long as}} they do in the wild, benefiting from consistent nutrition that meets their dietary requirements, medical advancements, and improved understanding of their housing requirements. In 1960, it was thought that lemurs could live between 23 and 25 years. We now know that the larger species can live for more than 30 years without showing signs of aging (<b>senescence)</b> and still be capable of reproduction.|$|E
5|$|The age {{of first}} {{breeding}} in gray wolves {{depends largely on}} environmental factors: when food is plentiful, or when wolf populations are heavily managed, wolves can rear pups at younger ages {{in order to better}} exploit abundant resources. This is further demonstrated by the fact that captive wolves have been known to breed as soon as they reach 9–10 months, while the youngest recorded breeding wolves in the wild were 2 years old. Females are capable of producing pups every year, with one litter annually being the average. Unlike the coyote, the gray wolf never reaches reproductive <b>senescence.</b> Estrus typically occurs in late winter, with older, multiparous females entering estrus 2–3 weeks earlier than younger females. During pregnancy, female wolves remain in a den located away from the peripheral zone of their territories, where violent encounters with other packs are more likely. Old females usually whelp in the den of their previous litter, while younger females typically den near their birthplace. The gestation period lasts 62–75 days, with pups usually being born in the summer period.|$|E
25|$|A second 'deliberate' {{mechanism}} is called replicative <b>senescence</b> or cellular <b>senescence.</b> Metaphorically, a cell {{may be said}} to 'count' (with its telomeres) the number of times that it has divided, and after a set number of replications, it languishes and dies. It has been proposed that this mechanism evolved to suppress cancer. Many invertebrates experience replicative <b>senescence,</b> though they never die of cancer. Even one-celled organisms count replications, and will die if they don't replenish their telomeres with conjugation (sex).|$|E
25|$|Medawar's {{theory was}} further {{developed}} by George C. Williams in 1957, who noted that <b>senescence</b> may be causing many deaths, even if animals are not 'dying of old age.' In the earliest stages of <b>senescence,</b> an animal may lose {{a bit of}} its speed, and then predators will seize it first, while younger animals flee successfully. Or its immune system may decline, and it becomes the first to die of a new infection. Nature is such a competitive place, said Williams, (turning Medawar's argument back at him), that {{even a little bit}} of <b>senescence</b> can be fatal; hence natural selection does indeed care; ageing isn't cost-free.|$|E
25|$|Auxin {{inhibits}} abscission {{prior to}} formation of abscission layer, and thus inhibits <b>senescence</b> of leaves.|$|E
25|$|Biological {{immortality}} (sometimes {{referred to}} bio-indefinite mortality) {{is a state}} in which {{the rate of mortality}} from <b>senescence</b> is stable or decreasing, thus decoupling it from chronological age. Various unicellular and multicellular species, including some vertebrates, achieve this state either throughout their existence or after living long enough. A biologically immortal living being can still die from means other than <b>senescence,</b> such as through injury or disease.|$|E
25|$|Strategies for Engineered Negligible <b>Senescence</b> (SENS) is {{the term}} coined by British biogerontologist Aubrey de Grey for the diverse range of {{regenerative}} medical therapies, either planned or currently in development, for the periodical repair of all age-related damage to human tissue with the ultimate purpose of maintaining a state of negligible <b>senescence</b> in the patient, thereby postponing age-associated disease {{for as long as}} the therapies are reapplied.|$|E
25|$|Ethylene shortens {{the shelf}} life of many fruits by hastening fruit {{ripening}} and floral <b>senescence.</b> Ethylene will shorten the shelf life of cut flowers and potted plants by accelerating floral <b>senescence</b> and floral abscission. Flowers and plants which {{are subjected to}} stress during shipping, handling, or storage produce ethylene causing {{a significant reduction in}} floral display. Flowers affected by ethylene include carnation, geranium, petunia, rose, and many others.|$|E
25|$|<b>Senescence</b> is a {{phenomenon}} where the cells are {{no longer able to}} divide, but also do not die and let others divide. They may also do other harmful things, like secreting proteins. Degeneration of joints, immune <b>senescence,</b> accumulation of visceral fat and type 2 diabetes are caused by this. Cells sometimes enter a state of resistance to signals sent, as part of a process called apoptosis, to instruct cells to destroy themselves.|$|E
25|$|The second SENS {{conference was}} held in September 2005 and was simply called Strategies for Engineered Negligible <b>Senescence</b> (SENS), Second Conference with the {{proceedings}} published in Rejuvenation Research.|$|E
25|$|Some plesiosaur fossils show pathologies, {{the result}} of illness or old age. In 2012, a {{mandible}} of Pliosaurus was described with a jaw joint clearly afflicted by arthritis, a typical sign of <b>senescence.</b>|$|E
25|$|Medawar did {{not suggest}} that there were {{fundamental}} limitations on lifespan. Organisms exhibiting negligible <b>senescence</b> suggest that ageing is not a fundamental limitation, {{at least not in}} the scale of mammal lifespan.|$|E
25|$|Cellular <b>senescence</b> {{is also a}} {{state that}} occurs in {{response}} to DNA damage or degradation {{that would make a}} cell's progeny nonviable; it is often a biochemical alternative to the self-destruction of such a damaged cell by apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|Two genetically {{modified}} crops have been approved for food use in some countries, but have not obtained approval for cultivation. A GM Melon engineered for delayed <b>senescence</b> was approved in 1999 and a herbicide tolerant GM wheat was approved in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Liabilities of aging. Here, {{the risk}} of failure {{increases}} with organizational age. This {{could be due to}} a liability of <b>senescence</b> (internal inefficiencies arising from the aging of the organization) or a liability of obsolescence (a growing external mismatch with the environment).|$|E
25|$|A recent {{increase}} in female longevity due to {{improvements in the}} standard of living and social care has also been suggested. It is difficult for selection, however, to favour aid to offspring from parents and grandparents. Irrespective of living standards, adaptive responses are limited by physiological mechanisms. In other words, <b>senescence</b> is programmed and regulated by specific genes.|$|E
25|$|Auxin plays also a minor {{role in the}} {{initiation}} of flowering and development of reproductive organs. In low concentrations, it can delay the <b>senescence</b> of flowers. A number of plant mutants have been described that affect flowering and have deficiencies in either auxin synthesis or transport. In maize, one example is bif2 barren inflorescence2.|$|E
25|$|Menopause in {{the animal}} kingdom appears to be uncommon, but the {{presence}} of this phenomenon in different species has not been thoroughly researched. Life histories show a varying degree of senescence; rapid senescing organisms (e.g., Pacific salmon and annual plants) do not have a post-reproductive life-stage. Gradual <b>senescence</b> is exhibited by all placental mammalian life histories.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the premise}} that {{biological}} aging can be halted or reversed by foreseeable technology remains controversial, research into developing possible therapeutic interventions is underway. Among the principal drivers of international collaboration in such research is the SENS Research Foundation, a non-profit organization that advocates a number of what it claims are plausible research pathways {{that might lead to}} engineered negligible <b>senescence</b> in humans.|$|E
25|$|As a cell {{adhesive}} substrate, CYR61 induces {{the activation}} of focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, RAC, and sustained activation of MAPK/ERK1-2. In macrophages, CYR61 also activates the transcription factor NFκB and stimulates M1 polarization. CYR61 activates Akt signaling in thymic epithelial cells, promoting their proliferation and thus thymic size growth. CYR61 has potent angiogenic activity upon endothelial cells and induces neovascularization, first demonstrated in a corneal micropocket implant assay and subsequently confirmed in a rabbit ischemic hindlimb model. CYR61 also accelerates {{and promotes the}} chondrogenic differentiation of mouse limb bud mesenchymal cells, and stimulates osteoblast differentiation but inhibits osteoclastogenesis. Interestingly, Cyr61 is a strong inducer of reactive oxygen species accumulation in fibroblastic cells, and this activity underlies many CYR61-induced apoptosis and <b>senescence.</b> CYR61 is able to support cell adhesion, stimulate cell migration, promote growth factor-induced cell proliferation and differentiation in some cell types, promote apoptosis in synergy with TNF family cytokines, and induce cellular <b>senescence</b> in fibroblasts.|$|E
25|$|Old {{people often}} have limited {{regenerative}} abilities {{and are more}} susceptible to disease, syndromes, and sickness than younger adults. The organic process of ageing is called <b>senescence,</b> the medical study of the aging process is called gerontology, and the study of diseases that afflict the elderly is called geriatrics. The elderly also face other social issues around retirement, loneliness, and ageism.|$|E
25|$|Ageing or aging (see {{spelling}} differences) is {{the process}} of becoming older. The term refers especially to human beings, many animals, and fungi, whereas for example bacteria, perennial plants and some simple animals are potentially immortal. In the broader sense, ageing can refer to single cells within an organism which have ceased dividing (cellular <b>senescence)</b> or to the population of a species (population ageing).|$|E
25|$|The {{ultimate}} {{objective of}} SENS is the eventual elimination of age-related diseases and infirmity by repeatedly reducing {{the state of}} <b>senescence</b> in the organism. The SENS project consists in implementing a series of periodic medical interventions designed to repair, prevent or render irrelevant all the types of molecular and cellular damage that cause age-related pathology and degeneration, {{in order to avoid}} debilitation and death from age-related causes.|$|E
25|$|Ethylene {{production}} is regulated {{by a variety}} of developmental and environmental factors. During the life of the plant, ethylene {{production is}} induced during certain stages of growth such as germination, ripening of fruits, abscission of leaves, and <b>senescence</b> of flowers. Ethylene production can also be induced {{by a variety of}} external aspects such as mechanical wounding, environmental stresses, and certain chemicals including auxin and other regulators.|$|E
25|$|Duration of crop growth cycles {{are above}} all, related to temperature. An {{increase}} in temperature will speed up development. In {{the case of}} an annual crop, the duration between sowing and harvesting will shorten (for example, the duration in order to harvest corn could shorten between one and four weeks). The shortening of such a cycle could have an adverse effect on productivity because <b>senescence</b> would occur sooner.|$|E
25|$|Although Emanuel opposes legalized euthanasia, he {{believes}} that after age 75 life is not worth living, {{and the pursuit of}} longevity, not a worthwhile goal for U.S. health care policy. This is refuted by neurosurgeon and medical ethicist Miguel Faria, who in two articles in Surgical Neurology International claims that healthy lifestyles and brain plasticity can lead to the postponement of <b>senescence</b> and lead to happiness even as we age.|$|E
25|$|However, CYR61 {{can also}} induce {{apoptosis}} and cellular <b>senescence,</b> two well-established mechanisms of tumor suppression Thus, whereas CYR61 can promote {{the proliferation of}} prostate cancer cells, it can also exacerbate apoptosis of these cells {{in the presence of}} the immune surveillance molecule TRAIL. CYR61 has an inhibitory effect on some cancers, and suppresses tumor growth of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, endometrial adenocarcinoma cells, and in melanoma cells.|$|E
25|$|Many {{studies in}} model organisms have {{established}} {{the significance of}} telomere structure and function in regulating genome stability, cellular aging, and oncogenesis. It {{has been suggested that}} mega-teleomeres may serve as protective mechanism against <b>senescence</b> in long-lived organisms. However, there is some debate on the topic, since telomeric length does not seem to affect lifespan in mice and birds with both long and short life-spans have been shown to have mega-telomeres.|$|E
25|$|Place cell {{function}} {{changes with}} age. Pharmaceuticals that target pathways involved in protein synthesis increase place cell functioning in <b>senescence.</b> Frequency of protein translation changes as animals age. A factor that aids in transcription, known as zif268 mRNA, {{is shown to}} decrease with age, thereby affecting memory consolidation. This form of mRNA is decreased in both the CA1 and CA2 hippocampal regions, these reduced levels causing spatial learning deficits.|$|E
