Important examples include propellant <b>slosh</b> <b>in</b> spacecraft tanks and rockets (especially upper stages), and the free surface effect (cargo <b>slosh)</b> <b>in</b> ships and trucks transporting liquids (for example oil and gasoline).However, it has become common to refer to liquid motion in a completely filled tank, i.e. without a free surface, as [...] "fuel slosh".|$|E
50|$|Liquid <b>slosh</b> <b>in</b> {{microgravity}} {{is relevant}} to spacecraft, most commonly Earth-orbiting satellites, and must take account of liquid surface tension which can alter the shape (and thus the eigenvalues) of the liquid slug. Typically, {{a large part of}} the mass fraction of a satellite is liquid propellant at/near Beginning of Life (BOL), and slosh can adversely affect satellite performance in a number of ways. For example, propellant slosh can introduce uncertainty in spacecraft attitude (pointing) which is often called jitter. Similar phenomena can cause pogo oscillation and can result in structural failure of space vehicle.|$|E
50|$|Another {{example is}} {{problematic}} {{interaction with the}} spacecraft Attitude Control System (ACS), especially for spinning satellites which can suffer resonance between slosh and nutation, or adverse changes to the rotational inertia.

40|$|Any {{motion of}} liquid surface is termed as a sloshing. It {{can be caused}} by any {{disturbance}} to partially filled liquid container. So to constitute a slosh dynamic of liquid, liquid must have free surface. The slosh dynamic of liquid alters the system dynamic or stability significantly when liquid is interact with the container. The motion of liquid with a free surface is of great concern in many engineering disciplines such as propellant <b>slosh</b> <b>in</b> spacecraft, rockets (especially upper stages), cargo <b>slosh</b> <b>in</b> ship and trucks transporting liquid (for example oil and gasoline) etc. To reduce the sloshing in moving container baffle is used as suppressing device.

40|$|Liquid {{sloshing}} {{is known}} to strongly influence the directional dynamics and safety performance of highway tank vehicles in a highly adverse manner. Hydrodynamic forces and moments arising from liquid cargo oscillations in the tank under steering and/or braking maneuvers reduce the stability limit and controllability of the partially filled tank vehicles. While the transient fluid slosh within moving containers has been widely investigated, interactions between the sloshing cargo and the vehicle system dynamics have been addressed {{in only a few}} studies due to associated challenges. Furthermore, roll stability of heavy tank vehicles have been extensively studied in the absence of transient slosh-induced forces and moments. This dissertation research aims at exploring the fluid <b>slosh</b> <b>in</b> moving containers through analytical methods and developing efficient models for simulating interactions of fluid slosh and vehicle dynamics. A comprehensive review of relevant studies reporting tank trucks accident data, tank design standards, and analysis methods of liquid sloshing in moving containers is initially performed and briefly summarized. The literature review provides not only the essential knowledge for developing an efficient method of analysis, but also demonstrates the needs for addressing limitations in the current standards so as to include effects of liquid sloshing dynamics in road tankers. An analytical model of two-dimensional fluid <b>slosh</b> <b>in</b> horizontal cylindrical tanks subject to a lateral excitation is initially formulated assuming potential flows and linearized free-surface boundary. For this purpose, the fluid domain in the Cartesian coordinates is transformed to the bipolar coordinates, where the Laplace equation could be solved using separation of variables. The resulting hydrodynamic pressure, free-surface elevation, and slosh force and roll moment are compared with the reported experimental and numerical results to illustrate the range of applicability and limitations of the linear slosh theory. The results suggest that the linear theory can yield reasonably accurate predictions of non-resonant lateral <b>slosh</b> <b>in</b> liquid transporting vehicles with significantly less computational effort than the CFD models. A multimodal model of fluid slosh is subsequently developed to study the effect of tank cross-section on transient lateral slosh. Natural frequencies and modes of liquid <b>slosh</b> <b>in</b> tanks of different cross-sections are obtained using a variational Ritz method, which are implemented into the multimodal model. The effect of transient liquid slosh and tank cross-section on rollover stability limits of a tank vehicle is also investigated by integrating the fluid slosh model into a roll plane model of the suspended tank vehicle. The results are presented for four different tank cross-sections: circular; elliptical; modified-oval; and Reuleaux-triangle. The results show that a tank cross-section with lower overall center of mass and lower critical slosh length could yield enhanced roll stability limit under medium- and high-fill conditions. The multimodal method is also employed to investigate the effect of partial longitudinal baffles on the transient lateral slosh. Natural slosh frequencies and modes are computed using a boundary integral solution of the Laplace equation. The computational efficiency is significantly improved by reducing the generalized eigenvalue problem to a standard one involving only the velocity potentials of the elements on the half free-surface length. Damping due to the baffles is estimated from the energy dissipation rate. The results are presented for different designs/lengths of longitudinal baffles, namely, top-mounted; bottom-mounted; and center-mounted baffles. It is shown that the multimodal method yields computationally efficient solutions of liquid slosh within moving baffled containers. The results suggest that a baffle is most effective and efficient when it pierces the free-surface and partly submerged in the liquid. A three-dimensional linear slosh model is further developed to study fluid motions under simultaneously applied lateral and longitudinal excitations, characterizing braking-in-a-turn maneuver, using the multimodal method. Three-dimensional Laplace equation is initially reduced to a two-dimensional Helmholtz equation using separation of variables. A higher order boundary integral solution of the Helmholtz equation is then formulated to compute natural slosh frequencies and modes in a horizontal cylindrical tank of arbitrary cross-section. The results obtained for a circular tank suggested rapid convergence of the natural slosh frequencies and hydrodynamic coefficients. The slosh forces and moments are also computed from the nonlinear analysis of liquid <b>slosh</b> <b>in</b> a tank under various lateral/longitudinal accelerations and fill ratios using the FLUENT software. Comparisons of the results obtained from the linear and nonlinear analyses revealed that the linear slosh theory yields reasonably accurate predictions of the peak slosh forces and moments under lateral/longitudinal accelerations of steady magnitudes of up to 0. 3 g/ 0. 2 g for a tank of aspect ratio of 2. 4. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} liquid <b>slosh</b> <b>in</b> {{spinning}} containers represents {{an important factor}} in an analytical assessment of the destabilizing energy dissipation in dual spin spacecraft. The solution of the governing equations in this problem is involved due to the occurrence of the Coriolis term. Pfeiffer (1974) introduced the concept of homogeneous vorticity. Although the assumption is valid for completely filled ellipsoidal cavities, it is only an approximation for a partially filled cavity. On the basis of the results of a stability analysis, it appears that the assumption of homogeneous vorticity may be true for filling volumes more than 55 %, while for lesser volumes this assumption cannot possibly be true, even approximately. Great care should then be taken in using Pfeiffer's model in flow problems involving intrinsic resonances...|$|E
