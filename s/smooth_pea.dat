40|$|Starch, total α- and β-amylase, and {{phosphorylase}} {{levels and}} the zymogram patterns of these 3 starch-degrading enzymes were determined in the cotyledons of <b>smooth</b> <b>pea</b> (Pisum sativum L.) {{during the first}} 15 days of germination. Starch is degraded slowly in the first 6 days; during this time, α-amylase is very low, β-amylase is present at a constant level while phosphorylase gradually increases and reaches a peak on the fifth day. Beginning on the sixth day {{there is a more}} rapid degradation of starch which coincides with α-amylase production. One phosphorylase band and 2 β-amylase bands are present in the zymogram of the imbibed cotyledon. An additional phosphorylase band and 1 α-amylase band appear during germination. Seeds imbibed in benzyladenine, chloramphenicol, and in cycloheximide show retarded growth and slower starch degradation and enzyme production than the controls. We conclude that α-amylase is the major enzyme involved in the initial degradation of starch into more soluble forms while phosphorylase and β-amylase assist in the further conversion to free sugars...|$|E
40|$|Fibronectin (FN) assembles into fibrillar {{networks}} by cells {{through an}} integrin-dependent mechanism. We have recently shown that simple FN adsorption onto poly(ethyl acrylate) surfaces (PEA), but not control polymer (poly(methyl acrylate), PMA), also triggered FN organization into a physiological fibrillar network. FN fibrils exhibited enhanced biological activities {{in terms of}} myogenic differentiation compared to individual FN molecules. In the present study, we investigate the influence of topological cues on the material-driven FN assembly and the myogenic differentiation process. Aligned and random electrospun fibers were prepared. While FN fibrils assembled on the PEA fibers as they do on the smooth surface, the characteristic distribution of globular FN molecules observed on flat PMA transformed into non-connected FN fibrils on electrospun PMA, which significantly enhanced cell differentiation. The direct relationship between the fibrillar organization of FN at the material interface and the myogenic process was further assessed by preparing FN gradients on <b>smooth</b> <b>PEA</b> and PMA films. Isolated FN molecules observed at one edge of the substrate gradually interconnected with each other, eventually forming a fully developed network of FN fibrils on PEA. In contrast, FN adopted a globular-like conformation along {{the entire length of}} the PMA surface, and the FN gradient consisted only of increased density of adsorbed FN. Correspondingly, the percentage of differentiated cells increased monotonically along the FN gradient on PEA but not on PMA. This work demonstrates an interplay between material chemistry and topology in modulating material-driven FN fibrillogenesis and cell differentiation...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the concentration of starch in plant materials from the intensity of the blue iodine complex, it is necessary to know the Blue Value (B. V.), which is defined in this paper as the absorbancy of 100 mg of a starch-iodine complex in 100 ml of aqueous solution. An adequate amount of plant material is treated with a hot CaCl 2 solution for 1 / 2 hour and the solute is diluted to 25 ml with CaCl 2. This basic solution serves to measure absorbancy, as well as for starch determination. The first measurement is done by the dilution of a proper amount of basic solution with water and after adding a diluted iodine-iodide solution the reading of B. V. is taken off. The second measurement is done by the precipitation of a starch iodine complex from a proper amount of the basic solution, which is then purified, destroyed by Na 2 SO 3 solution, and starch is determined by the anthrone method. These two readings serve for the establishing of B. V. for the starch. Once established, B. V. can be used for starch determination in the proper plant material. A high degree of variation of the B. V. was found. The highest B. V. was obtained for wrinkled pea seeds (17. 4); walnut, potato, <b>smooth</b> <b>pea</b> and pear gave values from 12. 6 to 11. 0, common bean and broad bean - 10. 3 and 9. 7, Triticale, carrot, rye, wheat and garden parsley from 8. 7 to 8. 0 and maize, oat, normal rice from 7. 6 to 6. 2. The B. V. for amylose was 25. 3, for potato starch 12. 4, soluble starch 11. 9, wheat starch 8. 8 and for Triticale and rye starches, 8. 7...|$|E

40|$|Our work {{aimed at}} the {{optimization}} {{of the structure of}} native starch for the preparation of concentrated water-based dispersions with film forming properties for the application in paints and varnishes. Potato and <b>smooth</b> <b>pea</b> starches were degraded via ManOx and hypochlorite conversion (9. 4 – 0. 2 • 106 g/mol) and used as starting materials for esterification and etherification reactions with different chain lengths (C 2 -C 6) and varied degrees of substitution (DS) / molar substitutions (MS) (0. 05 - 1. 1) for an increase in their hydrophobicity. The applied modification conditions led to cold water soluble or dispersible products with concentrations between 30 and 45 % (w/w) and viscosities in the range of 102 – 103 mPa•s (100 s- 1). The most samples had a newtonian flow behaviour and showed viscoelastic properties with higher values for the loss modulus (G’’) than the storage modulus (G’). Continuous films were observed with starch esters in the DS range of 0. 1 - 0. 8 {{and in the case of}} the starch ethers with MS values of 0. 7 - 0. 9. Wet and dry layer thicknesses of 25 - 50 μm and 7 - 12 μm were obtained (doctor blade: 100 μm). In the cross cut test on glass plates the esters had clearly better results with values of 0 and 1 (ISO class), in contrast to the tested ether with values of 4. The compatibility tests with 3 commercial binders showed that two Acronal binders (A 754 and S 559) (42 %) showed compatibility with the modified starches (58 %). Selected starch esters showed also good adhesion (class 0 and 1) on aluminium plates while the tested ether could be classified in the worst class (5). In the short-time corrosion stability tests which were evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, the barrier properties corresponded to the hydrophobicity of the starch ethers and esters.

40|$|Pigs {{were fed}} protein-free diets {{containing}} different pea inner fiber (PIF) isolates (from wrinkled or <b>smooth</b> <b>peas,</b> unprocessed or micronized) or different PIF levels (from 50 to 200 g/kg diet), and the flows of endogenous N and amino acids were {{measured at the}} ileum level. The flows were better correlated to the water-holding capacity (WHC) of the diet than to fiber intake (R 2 = 0. 996 vs 0. 76, respectively). The relationship with WHC was of the exponential type, with a high increase when the WHC exceeded 3 g of water/g diet. A similar pattern and correlation (R 2 = 0. 98) was obtained for the ileal flow of nucleobases (markers of epithelial cells and bacteria), whereas the relationships with crude mucus (R 2 = 0. 96) and diaminopimelic acid (marker of bacteria, R 2 = 0. 55) were linear. N retention by pigs fed with 0, 30, 60, or 90 g/kg of dry matter (DM) of the same protein isolates {{did not differ significantly}} in pigs receiving a 40 or 160 g of PIF/kg diet, despite significant differences in ileal N and amino acid flows between the two fiber levels (2. 0 and 3. 1 g of N/kg of DM intake, on average). These results and those of the flow of endogenous N compounds suggest an effect of the swollen fibers on the intestinal wall rather than a disturbance of the digestive processes. Peer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, Austrian monk Gregor Mendel's {{observations}} of pea pods {{led to the}} principles of Mendelian genetics, the foundation of modern genetics. He ended up growing and examining about 28,000 pea plants {{in the course of his}} experiments. Mendel chose peas for his experiments because he could grow them easily, develop pure-bred strains, protect them from cross-pollination, and control their pollination. Mendel cross-bred tall and dwarf pea plants, green and yellow peas, purple and white flowers, wrinkled and <b>smooth</b> <b>peas,</b> and a few other traits. He then observed the resulting offspring. In each of these cases, one trait is dominant and all the offspring, or Filial-1 (abbreviated F1) generation, showed the dominant trait. Then he crossed members of the F1 generation together and observed their offspring, the Filial-2 (abbreviated F2) generation. The F2 plants had the dominant trait in approximately a 3:1 ratio. Mendel reasoned that each parent had a 'vote' in the appearance of the offspring, and the non-dominant, or recessive, trait appeared only when it was inherited from both parents. He did further experiments that showed each trait is separately inherited. Unwittingly, Mendel had solved a major problem with Charles Darwin's theory of evolution: how new traits were preserved and not blended back into the population, a question Darwin himself did not answer. Mendel's work was published in an obscure Austrian journal and was not rediscovered until about 1900.|$|R

40|$|Starches {{extracted}} from wrinkled (WP) and <b>smooth</b> (SP) <b>peas</b> were treated using β-amylase (B) alone {{and also with}} a combination of β-amylase and transglucosidase (BT). After enzymatic treatment, the proportions of slowly digested starch in WP-B, WP-BT, SP-B and SP-BT samples were increased by 6 %, 9 %, 9 % and 12 %, respectively. Starches treated by a combination of β-amylase and transglucosidase exhibited a smaller amount of longer amylopectin chains, a larger amount of short amylopectin chains, and higher branching fraction. The branching fraction was significantly increased, with an increase of 8 %, 10 %, 13 % and 14 % for WP-B, WP-BT, SP-B and SP-BT, respectively. The maximum absorbance and iodine binding of enzyme-treated starches were reduced compared with their native starch parents. The C-type crystalline structure completely disappeared after enzymatic treatment. The results support previous findings that increases in the amount of shorter amylopectin chains and branch fraction are likely to contribute to the slow digestion of starch...|$|R
40|$|Pea {{was a part}} of the {{everyday}} diet of the European hunter-gatherers at the end of the last Ice Age. The major criteria to determine the domestication in pea are non-dehiscent pods, larger seed size and <b>smooth</b> seed testa. <b>Pea</b> seeds were found among the earliest findings of cultivated crops at the site of Tell El-Kerkh, Syria, from 10 th millennium BP. Along with cereals and lentil, pea has definitely become associated with the start of the 'agricultural revolution' in the Old World. Pea entered Europe in its southeast regions and progressed into its interior via Danube. Its distribution was rapid, since the available evidence reveals its presence in remote places at similar periods. The linguistic evidence supports the fact that pea had been present in nearly all regions of Europe. Most of European peoples have their own words denoting pea, meaning that it preceded the diversification of their own proto-languages...|$|R
40|$|Cleaned, whole <b>smooth</b> green <b>peas</b> (Pisum sativum L.) were reconstituted by {{soaking in}} tap water of 40 ¿°C (15, 20 or 25 ¿min) and {{subsequently}} either toasted (100 ¿°C during 1. 5 ¿min) and infrared (IR) radiated or just IR radiated. For IR radiation, a small-scale, propane-fired IR radiation plant was used with average residence times of 58 and 92 ¿s respectively. After exiting the conveyor belt, peas were held for a pre-determined period (holding: 0, 15 or 30 ¿min respectively) in a well-insulated container. Finally, all radiated peas were flaked (roll distance 0. 75 ¿mm) in a flaking mill located posterior to the IR plant and analysed for chemical and physical properties. Initial pea starch gelatinization degree (SGD) was 10. 1 % {{at a total}} starch content of 410. 1 ¿g/kg. Infrared processing during 92 ¿s significantly improved the SGD (from 10. 1 % to 32. 8 %) of pea flakes compared to treatment during 58 ¿s (SGD of 18. 6 %). The SGD was further improved with steam treatment of peas, prior to IR. For all determined parameters, no effect of holding time could be observed. Starch gelatinization degree can be improved by soaking, toasting and IR processing. The substantial improvement of SGD, however can be only obtained by a longer IR residence {{time as well as}} through toasting, prior to the IR processing. The improvements in SGD, however are paralleled by a lower durability of flakes (range 34. 9 % to 87. 4 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Remember {{the monk}} and the peas? The story {{introduced}} school children to genetics {{long before the}} human genome made the evening news. The Augustinian monk Gregor Mendel conducted hundreds of experiments on the edible pea, crossing <b>peas</b> that were <b>smooth</b> or wrinkled, <b>peas</b> that grew tall or short, peas that had white or violet flowers. He found {{that the results of}} these crosses were predictable, and in 1865 he presented his findings to the Brunn Society for the Study of Natural Science in Moravia (1). But there was little reaction to Mendels report, and his next experiments took a different turn. Mendel sent his report to a famous botanist in Munich, Karl Wilhelm von Nägeli. The botanist replied, but his letter encouraged Mendel to examine the hawkweeds, a group of plants related to asters. In 1866, no one recognized that hawkweeds reproduced asexually and were not subject to Mendels meticulously developed theories of hybridization. Mendel went through years of scientific failure, all the while continuing his hawkweed correspondence with Nägeli. By 1873 Mendel gave up his experiments and became abbot of the monastery. He died in 1884 without ever seeing his pea experiments vindicated (1) ...|$|R
40|$|Many of the world’s {{rivers and}} {{wetlands}} have degraded with alteration of flow regimes. Mostly {{this is due}} to impacts of structures (i. e. dams and weirs), but increasingly mining and access to groundwater have affected flooding regimes to wetlands. We investigated water levels within Thirlmere Lakes National Park, which are primarily filled by rainfall but interact with shallow groundwater. We focused on the three of the five lakes, with the most historical data, and compared inputs from rainfall and water levels over 113 years (1900 – 2012). This first step required development of threedimensional models of the lakes, using topographic surveys. We then superimposed historical aerial photographs and ground photographs, allowing determination of water levels (1884 – 2012, n= 49 photographs/maps). We also investigated trends in groundwater levels (1999 - 2011) and created groundwater contour maps for two periods, before and after 1982, when longwall coal mining began. Rainfall and catchment inflow patterns were examined at three nearby water bodies (Avon, Warragamba and Nepean Dams), acting as ‘control sites’. There were no significant long-term trends in rainfall at the three ‘control sites’, although rainfall increased significantly at Thirlmere Lakes (1900 – 2012). There were similar evaporation patterns at all sites and inflows at the three dams had not decreased. Contrastingly, there was a severe decline in water levels at Thirlmere Lakes. The disassociation of inflows and water levels (1930 - 2011) had steadily increased, especially since the 1980 ’s and we detected sudden drops in water levels in 1999, 2000 and 2004 in three lakes. This did not coincide with the main period of water extraction for steam engines and Picton Tuberculosis Village at Thirlmere Lakes (1884 - 1910). Groundwater levels in the shallow aquifer declined by up to 40 m after mining commenced in 1982 and the number of groundwater bores had increased exponentially (1940 - 2011). Although there were no publicly available data on how much groundwater was extracted each year, the serious decline in water levels coincided with increased groundwater development and longwall mining (29 longwall panels (2010)). The changes to water levels were not climate related and so are perhaps best explained by anthropogenic impacts. Either there was considerable pumping of groundwater or longwall coal mining disrupted the groundwater aquifers, causing diversion of groundwater resources that drained Thirlmere Lakes. Or, changes could be due to a combination of these two anthropogenic factors. The implications are significant for the ecological character of the Thirlmere Lakes. There are many affected obligate aquatic species or species reliant on wet habitats, including five species of waterbirds (Australasian bittern Botaurus poiciloptilus, Australian painted snipe Rostratula australis, great egret Ardea alba, cattle egret Ardea ibis, and Latham’s or Japanese Snipe Gallinago hardwickii) one fish species (Macquarie perch Macquaria australasica), two frog species (giant burrowing frog Heleioporus australiacus, Littlejohn’s tree frog Litoria littlejohni) and two plant species (<b>smooth</b> bush <b>pea</b> Pultenaea glabra, Kangaloon sun orchid Thelymitra Kangaloon) that are also listed as threatened. There are serious implications for governments and their responsibilities for managing the values of Thirlmere Lakes National Park along with the Blue Mountains World Heritage Area of which it is a part. These major changes in flooding regimes to Thirlmere Lakes will continue to degrade the National Park, its ecological, cultural and recreational values...|$|R
