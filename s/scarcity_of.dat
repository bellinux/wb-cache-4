In this context, two objections against market-based indicators made by Norgaard [15] are examined. Poten-tially, resource allocators are not informed correctly <b>of</b> <b>scarcity</b> {{and maybe they}} ignore some aspects <b>of</b> <b>scarcity</b> consciously. The traditional view <b>of</b> <b>scarcity</b> is reviewed and its flaws revealed. Finally, a reinterpre-tation <b>of</b> <b>scarcity</b> is introduced which legitimizes market-based scarcity indicators. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Competition {{is fierce}} {{and often the}} first to act has an advantage, {{especially}} in environments where there are excess resources. However, expanding quickly to absorb excess resources creates requirements that might be unmet in future conditions <b>of</b> <b>scarcity.</b> Different patterns <b>of</b> <b>scarcity</b> call for different strategies. We define a model of interacting specialists (entities) to analyze which sizing strategies are most successful in environments subjected to frequent periods <b>of</b> <b>scarcity.</b> We require entities to compete for a common resource whose scarcity changes periodically, then study the viability of entities following three different strategies through <b>scarcity</b> episodes <b>of</b> varying duration and intensity. The three sizing strategies are: aggressive, moderate, and conservative. Aggressive strategies are most effective when the episodes <b>of</b> <b>scarcity</b> are shorter and moderate; conversely, conservative strategies are most effective in cases of longer or more severe scarcity...|$|R

40|$|Objectives of the Study: The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine effects of {{different}} types <b>of</b> <b>scarcity</b> messages on consumer purchase intention in the context of electronic commerce. The study also investigates the moderating roles of several individual-difference variables. Academic background and methodology: Prior research has demonstrated effects <b>of</b> <b>scarcity</b> on consumer purchase intention in many aspects. Only a few studies, however, have examined scarcity effects in the context of electronic commerce, where the ease of searching for alternative online deals may change the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>scarcity</b> messages. Thus, it is critical to gain insights into how different types <b>of</b> <b>scarcity</b> messages influence consumer purchase intention in online shopping. Specifically, the study compares effects <b>of</b> <b>scarcity</b> between two contexts of e-commerce: high versus low ease of searching for deals. Accordingly, an online-survey experiment was conducted. The participants of the survey were exposed to two contexts. In each context, they were randomly allocated into one of six conditions containing different types <b>of</b> <b>scarcity</b> messages. Their purchase intentions were measured and investigated in order to figure out variances between conditions in each searching-ease context and the differences between two contexts. Additionally, the study examined the interaction between scarcity and three potential moderators <b>of</b> <b>scarcity</b> effects: uncertainty avoidance, need for cognitive closure, and product familiarity, of which their moderating roles were demonstrated in prior research. Findings and conclusions: The study results showed that in the context <b>of</b> electronic commerce, <b>scarcity</b> messages became less effective. In the context of high searching-ease, no significant effect <b>of</b> <b>scarcity</b> was found. In the context of low searching-ease, only the scarcity message in form of intensive time limit, in association with a signal of price promotion, presented a significant effect on consumer purchase intention. Additionally, contrary to the findings of prior research, three investigated moderators showed no significant interaction with scarcity. This outcome suggested that to explain the underlying factors <b>of</b> <b>scarcity</b> effects in the context of e-commerce, other mediators should be considered. This finding is significant for managers who intend to use scarcity as a marketing tool for their online businesses. The result also contributes to the research area <b>of</b> <b>scarcity</b> effects...|$|R
