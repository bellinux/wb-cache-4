40|$|It was {{postulated}} that swelling dependent chloride channels {{are involved in}} the proton secretion of parietal cells. Since omeprazole, lansoprazole and its acid activated <b>sulphenamide</b> form AG 2000 are structurally related to phenol derivatives known to block swelling dependent chloride channels, we set out to test, whether these substances – which are known to block the H,K-ATPase – could also lead to an inhibition of swelling-dependent chloride channels. Swelling-dependent chloride channels – characterized in many different cell types – show highly conserved biophysical and pharmacological features, therefore we investigated the effect of omeprazole, lansoprazole and its acid activated <b>sulphenamide</b> form AG 2000 on swelling-dependent chloride channels elicited in fibroblasts, after the reduction of the extracellular osmolarity. Omeprazole, lansoprazole and its acid activated <b>sulphenamide</b> form AG 2000 are able to block swelling-dependent chloride channels (IClswell). Lansoprazole and its protonated metabolite AG 2000 act on at least two different sites of the IClswell protein: on an extracellular site which seems to be in a functional proximity to the nucleotide binding site, and on an intracellular site which allows the formation of disulfide-bridges. The inhibition of the proton pump and the simultaneous blocking of chloride channels by omeprazole, lansoprazole and its acid activated <b>sulphenamide</b> form AG 2000, as described here could be an effective mode to restrict proton secretion in parietal cells...|$|E

40|$|Cure {{characteristics}} and tear properties of {{epoxidized natural rubber}} (ENR- 33) and natural rubber were studied. Three types of accelerators, namely 2 -mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT), 2 -morpholinothiobenzothiazole (MBS) and N-tert-butyl- 2 -benzothiazyl <b>sulphenamide</b> (TBBS) were used in this work. The conventional valcanization (CV) system was used. Cure characteristics were determined using a Monsanto Oscillating Disk Rheometer (ODR 2000) at 150 ºC. Also, a systematic study of tear strength was carried out before and after ageing at 70 ºC for 72 h. A Hounsfield tensometer (Model H 10 KS) operating at 500 mm/min {{was used to determine}} the tear strength using standard angle test pieces. The results indicated that scorch time and cure time of natural rubber are greater than those of ENR- 33 compounds. However, the contrary was observed for the minimum and maximum torques and the torque differences. The observation is attributed to the activation of a double bond by the adjacent epoxide group in ENR- 33.

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{published}} in the Journal of Rubber Research. This study prepared a natural rubber/polybutadiene (NR/BR: 50 / 50 wt%) blend using precipitated amorphous white silica filler the surface of which had been pre-treated with bis-(3 -triethoxysilylpropyl) -tetrasulphane (TESPT). TESPT is a sulphur-bearing bifunctional organosilane, which chemically bonds silica to rubber via the sulphur to form strong rubber-silica interaction. The rubbers were primarily cured by using sulphur in TESPT, and the cure was optimised by adding <b>sulphenamide</b> accelerator, zinc oxide activator and elemental sulphur. The chemical bonding between the sulphur in TESPT and the rubbers was affected mainly by the addition of the chemical curatives. In the absence of full chemical bonding between the sulphur in TESPT and the rubbers, most of the mechanical properties of the blend were inferior. But when chemical bonds or crosslinks fully formed between the sulphur in TESPT and the rubbers, the tensile strength, elongation at break, stored energy density at break, tear energy, cyclic fatigue life and abrasion resistance were enhanced. For example, the cyclic fatigue life of the blend increased by almost 50, 000 times, which was a major improvement...|$|E
40|$|A {{study has}} been made, using High Pressure Liquid Chromatography, of the {{migration}} of TMQ (a quinoline type) and 6 PPD (a paraphenylenediamine type) antidegradants from a tyre sidewall compound into adjacent casing and liner compounds containing no antidegradant. Migration takes place at a rapid rate, even during the vulcanisation of the composite. After 4000 hours ageing in nitrogen at 100 oC, there is {{a higher level of}} antidegradants in the casing than in the sidewall. An equilibrium distribution is not obtained. After 114 days at 50 oC in 95 % relative humidity, the level of solvent extractable 6 PPD fell to zero, but subsequent ageing for 2 years in 50 pphm ozone showed no evidence of sidewall cracking. It is suggested that the antidegradant is still active but linked to the polymer chain. An analytical method, for the type and amount of <b>sulphenamide</b> accelerators in vulcanised rubber compounds, has been developed. During the vulcanisation process, the accelerators decay, liberating specific amines which have been solvent extracted, derivatised with 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene and the yellow coloured zwitter ion analysed using High Pressure Liquid Chromatography. The decay of the accelerator and sulphur during the vulcanisation process, has been studied. It has been demonstrated that the sulphur crosslinking with a styrenebutadiene polymer is a first order reaction, after an initial period during which the accelerator content falls to zero. Variations in sulphur to accelerator ratios gave consistent rate constants for the crosslinking, except for a sulphur level of less than 1 % by weight and a ratiio of accelerator to sulphur of 1 : 1. 3. The retention time of the reaction product between sulphur and accelerator from an HPLC column changes with cure time, showing that the precurser to crosslinking is an ever changing material. One of these reaction products has been analysed...|$|E
40|$|Rubber is {{viscoelastic}} {{in nature}} and used {{in a variety of}} industrial applications. Rubber mounts are used to dampen vibration and shock. Damping, fatigue and dynamic properties of rubber mounts depend to a large extent on chemical ingredients mixed with the rubber. Natural rubber is the most widely used polymer for conventional mounts. Apart from natural rubber, different fillers and rubber chemicals are also present in conventional formulation of rubber mounts. Conventionally, five different classes of chemical curatives are used in rubber industries, which include curing agents, primary and secondary accelerators as well as primary and secondary activators. When chemical curatives are present in excessive amounts in rubber, they migrate to the rubber surface and form a bloomed layer. In this work, two rubber formulations were used for preparing rubber-to-metal bonded bobbin mounts. The formulations were primarily based on natural rubber with 60 parts per hundred rubber by weight (p. h. r.) precipitated amorphous white silica nanofiller. The surface of silica was pre-treated with bis(3 -triethoxysilylpropyl) -tetrasulphane (TESPT) coupling agent to chemically bond silica to the rubber. The rubber was cured primarily by reacting the tetrasulphane groups of TESPT with the rubber chains using a <b>sulphenamide</b> accelerator and the cure was then optimised by adding zinc oxide as an activator. The ratio of the accelerator to activator in one compound was 6 p. h. r. / 0. 3. p. h. r. and the compound showed extensive blooming of the accelerator on the rubber surface when stored at ambient temperature for up to 60 days. However, the blooming was reduced significantly by changing the ratio of the accelerator to activator to 3 p. h. r. / 2. 5. p. h. r., which was subsequently used to prepare a second compound. Dynamic and static properties of the bobbins were subsequently measured. Both compounds showed very low phase angle (δ) and spring rate ratio K d /K s (K d : dynamic spring rate; K s : static spring rate). Notably, the compound with the high accelerator to activator ratio had superior aforementioned properties, but the dynamic fatigue life of the bobbin reduced noticeably due to a gradual deterioration of the bond caused by the migration of the accelerator to the bonded interface...|$|E
40|$|Phosphorylation is {{of major}} {{importance}} in cell signalling processes like cell migration, cell proliferation and cell differentiation within higher eukaryotic organisms. Therefore, {{the balance between}} phosphorylation, mediated by kinases, and dephosphorylation, mediated by phosphatases, must be tightly controlled. Kinases as well as phosphatases are known {{to play a role}} in diseases like cancer and diabetes. Future research on PTPs will give important information about the exact roles they fulfill in signal transduction and the implications they have in diseases. The aim of this work is the elucidation of the regulatory mechanism of oxidation induced inhibition of Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Phosphatases (RPTPs). RPTPa activity is inhibited by the formation of stable dimers upon oxidation. The crystal structure of RPTPa shows that a wedge-like structure of one subunit inserts into the catalytic cleft of the other, thereby preventing substrate binding. The cysteine of the membrane distal domain (RPTP-D 2) acts as a redox sensor since mutating this residue into a serine prevents the formation of stable dimers and renders the phosphatase active after oxidation. In chapter II an antibody is described that specifically recognizes oxidized cysteines in the PTP-loop. We found that the cysteine of RPTPa-D 2 is indeed more susceptible to oxidation than the cysteine of RPTPa-D 1. In chapter III we investigated whether differential oxidation is a common theme in RPTPs. The guanidinium group of a nearby serine appears to define the susceptibility of the catalytic site cysteine. Chapter IV shows the crystal structure of oxidized RPTPa-D 2 in which a <b>sulphenamide</b> form was identified just as was found in the crystal structure of PTP 1 B. This form appeared to be reversible and stable up to 24 hours. Whether dimerization induced inhibition could be a general regulatory mechanism for RPTPs was investigated in chapter V. The intracellular domains of RPTPa, RPTPm, LAR and CD 45 all formed stable dimers upon oxidation. Besides they all showed profound conformational changes in response to oxidation. Here, we propose the following model. RPTPs exist on the cell membrane as preformed active dimers. In the presence of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), the conserved second, membrane distal catalytic domain functions as a redox sensor, transducing the oxidation information to the first, membrane proximal catalytically active domain. The inhibitory wedge of one subunit will subsequently occlude the catalytic cleft of the other, thereby preventing substrate binding, rendering the RPTP inactive. Since the oxidation of the cysteines is reversible, reduction of the cysteine of the second catalytic domain will reform the RPTPs to an active dimeric state. Taken together, we propose that the activity of RPTPs is regulated by an oxidation-induced dimerization mechanism...|$|E
