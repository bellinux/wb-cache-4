Today, the new GMR materials based on organic material obtained after allowing for Organic Magnetoresistance (OMAR) was found in OLEDs (organic light-emitting diodes). This organic material is used as a spacer layer in GMR devices with spin-valve structures. Traditionally, metals and semiconductors are used as a spacer layer in spin-valve. However, several factors such as spin scattering caused by large atoms of the spacer material and the interface scattering of ferromagnetic with a spacer, will limit the efficiency of spin-valve. In this paper, we describe a new GMR materials based on organic material that we have developed. Comment: 3 pages, 6 figures, sumbitted to ICICI-BME 2011 "Science and Technology for Health...|$|E

40|$|With current {{demand for}} {{decreased}} size of micro/nanoscale systems, coupled with increased mobility, critical {{understanding of the}} ensuing contact or impact related behavior of thin solid films used in these systems {{is of paramount importance}} for improved design and reliability. In modern micro/nanodevice technologies significant emphasis has to be placed on the design of thin-films which can provide the required contact and scratch resistance. To aid this endeavor, scientific studies of the contact and scratch processes in these systems, both static and dynamic are needed to provide the tools necessary to help the advancement of these technologies. One such problem is the impact contact or quasi-static contact and scratch of the slider and disk in magnetic storage hard disk drives (HDD). Similar contact problems are encountered during the operation of other micromechanical systems like RF-MEMS switches where surface damage is observed after cyclic contact. One of the most critical elements of multilayer contact analysis is proper determination of the nanomechanical properties of each thin-film on the multilayer system. In {{the first part of this}} work the method of determining the mechanical properties using the Oliver and Pharr (O-P) nanoindentation technique is described. For nanometer sized thin-films where the O-P technique gives incorrect results, an improved method is used. Later a dimensional analysis-based method to obtain the mechanical properties from the nanoindentation data is implemented for magnetic storage films. A direct comparison of the properties obtained from conventional O-P nanoindentation technique to this new technique is presented. In the second part of this work, the effect of dynamic contact or impact on multilayer thin films specific to magnetic storage hard disk drives is presented. Since there are no impact models available for multilayer thin films in the literature, a new contact mechanics-based (CM) semi-analytical model of a rigid sphere (representing a slider corner) impacting an elastic-plastic (E-P) multilayer thin-film half-space was proposed for the first time to examine the potential damage to a magnetic <b>storage</b> <b>head</b> disk interface (HDI). A dynamic 3 D finite element analysis (FEA) model was also developed to examine the impact damage in more detail and validate the impact model. To characterize the plastic deformation and frictional energy losses associated with the impact damage, a comprehensive oblique elastic impact coefficient of restitution (COR) model was proposed for elastic-plastic impacts for the first time and validated using FEA. A method to decouple the oblique impact parameters into normal impact COR and tangential impact COR was formulated. Since, in microsystems, the geometry of the impacting bodies is not limited to spherical bodies, a new contact mechanics-based (CM) model of a rigid cylinder with a finite length impacting an elastic-plastic homogeneous disk was also proposed and includes a novel method of estimating the residual depth after impact. Based on elastic unloading, an improved coefficient of restitution model was also proposed. This new impact model was applied to study a practical case of a cylindrical feature on the slider of a magnetic storage hard disk drive impacting the disk to predict various critical impact contact parameters. The CM model was validated using a plane strain FEA-based model and it was found that a cylindrical feature with longer length results in a substantial alleviation of impact damage. The final part of this work involved the investigation of the performance of thin-film multilayers while under the influence of much milder quasi-static contact scratch. A 2 D plane strain FEA model of a rigid cylinder sliding over a multilayered thin-film half space was developed. The effects of different contact parameters such as applied normal load, friction coefficient and radius of curvature of the cylinder on the critical stresses in the multilayer system were analyzed. Later, for direct experimental comparison a full-blown 3 D quasi-static FEA-based nanoscratch model of the multilayer thin-film system was also developed. The FEA scratch results were compared to nanoscratch experiments performed on actual magnetic disks. Consequently, the 3 D FEA scratch model was used to quantitatively correlate the subsurface plastic deformation to the magnetic erasures typically found in HDDs due to scratch for the very first time...|$|E

During storage, especially under suboptimal conditions, nutritional composition of the harvested produce continues to change. The possible impact of prior <b>storage</b> of the <b>heads</b> on the performance of the fresh-cut product has not been quantified, and was the aim of this study. The experiments were performed with three related genotypes of Lactuca sativa L. (butterhead lettuce) : two green varieties and one red variety. The effect of prior storage on quality parameters in the stored whole heads and on subsequent fresh-cut quality performance was investigated. In addition, the effect of prior <b>storage</b> of <b>heads</b> with and without their root system and the application of light during storage were investigated.

The developed methodology was tested in the Akrotiri basin, Cyprus. The necessity for the groundwater-based {{model calibration}}, rather than a typical runoff-based one, arose from the very intermittent character of the runoff in the Akrotiri basin, a case often met in semi-arid regions. Introducing a datum and converting groundwater <b>storage</b> to <b>head</b> made the observable groundwater level the calibration indicator. The modelling of the Akrotiri basin leads us to conclude that groundwater level is a useful indicator for hydrological model calibration that can be potentially used in other similar situations in the absence of river flow measurements. However, the option of an automatic calibration of the complex hydrologic model PRMS by MMS did not ensure a good outcome. On the other hand, automatic optimisation, combined with heuristic expert intervention, enabled achievement of good calibration and constitutes a valuable means for saving effort and improving modelling performance. To this end, results must be scrutinised, melding the viewpoint of physical sense with mathematical efficiency criteria. Thus optimised, PRMS achieved a low simulation error, good reproduction of the historic trend of the aquifer water level evolution and reasonable physical behaviour (good hydrologic balance, Reasonable match of aquifer level evolution, good estimation of mean natural recharge rate).

Therefore, characterizing those changes {{is essential for}} understanding flow and transport {{during and after the}} CO 2 injection because they can affect the storage capacity, injectivity, and trapping mechanisms. Yet, few published studies evaluate the changes of hydrodynamic properties due to fluid-rock interactions. We report seven dissolution experiments performed on four limestone samples by injecting water with pH ranging from 3. 5 to 5. 0. Sample porosity, diffusion coefficient, and pore-size distribution were measured before and after each rock attack, which was repeated twice on three of the samples. Permeability was monitored continuously and chemical samples were taken to evaluate calcite dissolution. We find that overall porosity increases over time as expected. But the increase is nonuniform along the sample. At the samples inlets, large pores increase significantly while small pores remain unchanged, which is consistent with wormhole initiation. However, the size of largest pores is reduced at the outlet, which we attribute to clogging by particles dragged from the inlet. As a result, the overall permeability is reduced. Particle dragging is unlikely during supercritical CO 2 <b>storage</b> because <b>head</b> gradients are small, but may be expected in the case of dissolved CO 2 injection or during well stimulation by acid injection.
