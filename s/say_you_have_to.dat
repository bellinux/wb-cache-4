[...] Colin Murray, Fighting Talk's Big Day Out, Saturday 1st June 2013 For all the responses are often outrageously comedic, due to some being extremely near the knuckle, hosts have still had to reiterate on many occasions that the statements are not meant to be taken seriously in any way. Indeed, more often than not they actually have the intention of mocking those who would hold such an abhorrent view; even so, despite repeated clarification, complaints are still a fairly regular occurrence.|$|E
5000|$|The Mina {{disaster}} {{has increased}} and emboldened opposition to Saudi King Salman. The Guardian reported on 28 September 2015 that a [...] "senior Saudi prince has launched an unprecedented call {{for change in}} the country’s leadership" [...] writing two letters calling for his replacement. Citing the Mina Crush disaster along with the war in Yemen as reasons for calling for the king's removal, the unnamed prince stated that [...] "eight of the twelve sons of Saudi Arabia's founder, King Ibn Saud" [...] {{as well as a}} majority of the kingdom's Ulama (most senior religious leaders) would support such a coup. The prince was quoted by the Guardian as saying [...] "The public are also pushing this very hard, all kinds of people, tribal leaders ... They <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do this or the country will go to disaster." [...] According to reports, favored to replace Salman is his younger brother, Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, another son of Saudi Arabia's founding king Ibn Saud, and former Interior Minister.|$|E
5000|$|Children walking {{alone at}} night may {{encounter}} a woman wearing a surgical mask. This is not an unusual sight in Japan, as people wear them to protect others from their colds or sicknesses. The woman will stop the child and ask, [...] "Am I beautiful?" [...] If they say [...] "no", she kills them {{with a pair of}} scissors she always carries. If they say [...] "yes", the woman removes her mask to reveal her mouth has been slit from ear to ear. The Kuchisake-onna will then ask, [...] "How about now?" [...] Regardless of whether the child answers yes or no at this point, the woman will kill them: If they say no, they are cut in half; if they say yes, she cuts their mouths to be exactly like hers. To escape the Kuchisake-onna, you can answer her second question with [...] "You're average" [...] or [...] "So-so", which will confuse her so that you can escape. Alternatively, you can throw fruits or sweets at her feet, which she will pick up, thus giving the victim a chance to run. One other option is to ask her if you are pretty: She will also get confused and leave. And a fourth possibility is to <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> meet up with your husband/your wife and she will excuse herself and leave.|$|E

[...] Mitzeee was also billed to Shenton as an aspiring model who wanted a better life and desperately wanted the lifestyle {{of the rich and}} famous. At the time of her arrival Shenton praised her stating: [...] "I think that's really current {{because there are so many}} people, particularly young girls, who really want that and it is their goal." [...] Shenton also claimed that the more viewers get to know Mitzeee the more they will realise she isn't as one-dimensional as she first seems. Shenton also described her adding: [...] "She hides her intelligence well but she's actually a very intelligent girl. She's also quite manipulative and vindictive and some would <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be quite intelligent to do that! That's Mitzeee - there's definitely layers." [...] She is also described as doing whatever to get where she wants to be and being quite ruthless in the process." [...] Mitzeee is also popular with males, she often uses this to get what she wants. Mitzeee does not crave this attention, with Shenton stating [...] "I think she's far too shrewd for that. She uses the attention to get what she wants and uses her femininity to get where she wants to be. I don't think for a second she's taken in by anything. She uses it as a tool, really." [...] She has also been described as [...] "fame-hungry" [...] and a [...] "gossip".|$|E
40|$|It is {{with great}} regret that I must {{inform you that}} your {{submission}} to Ecology…will be accepted, pending revision. My regrets are motivated, of course, by your excessive profile in the literature. Nothing would have given more pleasure than to reject the paper, but the excellent reviews, and my own opinion of the work, make this impossible. (Broadie, 2001) Not all letters from journal editors and comments from reviewers will feel like welcome news or induce a chuckle in the writer. Necessarily and often, editors and reviewers will send an author a list of comments and suggestions for changes to a submitted work before acceptance. This is precisely the purpose of peer review: to have our work evaluated by peers on its merit, relevance, and presentation and to learn from colleagues how we might deepen, broaden, focus, or polish our work. 1 Some <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> have a thick skin to endure the academic publishing process; I <b>say</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be open. I have learned this from other writers: when submitting work to publishers, consider that critiques have merit, {{go back to your}} work, and only if you have taken an exhaustive look and found the comments unwarranted may you reject the feedback.
