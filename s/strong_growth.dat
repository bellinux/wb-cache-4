5|$|As the UK economy {{continues}} {{to recover from the}} downturn experienced in 2008–10, Manchester compares favourably to other geographies according to the latest figures. In 2012 it is shown the strongest annual growth in business stock (5%) of all the Core Cities. The city experienced a relatively sharp {{increase in the number of}} business deaths, the largest increase of all the Core Cities, however this was offset by <b>strong</b> <b>growth</b> in new businesses which resulted in a strong net growth.|$|E
5|$|Business {{aviation}} {{has shown}} <b>strong</b> <b>growth,</b> although {{the numbers of}} aircraft on the UK register have declined. This reflects a shift away from turboprop aircraft towards foreign-registered business jets based in the UK, which {{are estimated to be}} growing in numbers. However, twin piston-engined aircraft numbers have declined significantly, reflecting pressures on the light air-taxi segment from increasingly flexible and cheaper scheduled services, and a more sophisticated corporate charter business. The amount of flight training conducted by UK schools has declined, largely at the hands of competition from foreign schools, which benefit from lower costs and better weather.|$|E
5|$|Regional airports, such as Edinburgh Airport, have {{experienced}} <b>strong</b> <b>growth</b> in CAT operations in recent years. These operations are commercially and operationally incompatible with GA, {{and although there}} is no evidence of deliberate discrimination, the effect has been to discourage or exclude it. GA aircraft are being subject to significant increases in charges, including the imposition of handling fees in some cases. Some airports restrict or deny GA parking, and others limit or refuse certain GA activity. As a result, light GA aircraft are now rarely or never seen at large, busy international airports such as Heathrow, Stansted, Gatwick and Manchester.|$|E

5|$|The Somerton parish had a {{population}} of 4,706 as of 2002. In the 1801 census {{the population of the}} town was 1,145 and {{the first half of the}} 19th century saw <b>strong</b> <b>growth</b> (reflecting that seen elsewhere in England during this period), with the population rising to 2,140 in 1851. It however then began to drop, starting with a significant drop to 1,917 by the 1861 census. The population steadily fell until 1921, before steadily rising thereafter. It was not until 1961 that the population of Somerton had risen above its former population of 1851. The population has since continued to steadily increase.|$|E
5|$|Although the Klan {{had four}} million members in 1924, the group's {{membership}} quickly shrank after Stephenson's widely publicized trial. The Indiana Klan {{lost more than}} 90% of its members {{by the end of}} the proceedings, and there were mass resignations in other states as well. Other scandals emerged, further damaging Klan enrollment. Although the Colorado Klan had seen <b>strong</b> <b>growth,</b> Evans asked the Grand Dragon, John Galen Locke, to resign after local corruption scandals in 1925 involving Klan members who served as police. Evans' request was poorly received by Colorado Klan members; local enrollment subsequently plummeted. He encountered difficulties with Klan leaders in Pennsylvania in 1926, after many of them concluded that he was too autocratic. In response, he revoked the charters of several local Klan groups and removed John Strayer, a state legislator, from his position of authority in the Klan. When the Pennsylvania groups continued to refer to themselves as the Ku Klux Klan, Evans sued them in federal court. Pennsylvania Klan members launched a detailed legal offensive against Evans and other Klan leaders, alleging misdeeds, including participation in kidnappings and lynchings. Evans' suit was unsuccessful and, as many newspapers reported the scandalous allegations aired in court, the Pennsylvania Klan suffered a serious decline in membership and support.|$|E
5|$|Heathen {{influences}} were {{apparent in}} forms of black metal from the 1990s, where lyrics and themes often expressed {{a longing for}} a pre-Christian Northern past; the mass media typically associated this music genre with Satanism. The Pagan metal genre—which emerged from the fragmentation of the extreme metal scene in Northern Europe during the early 1990s—came {{to play an important}} role in the North European Pagan scene. Many musicians involved in Viking metal were also practicing Heathens, with many metal bands embracing the heroic masculinity embodied in Norse mythological figures like Odin and Thor. From the mid-1990s, the Internet greatly aided the propagation of Heathenry in various parts of the world. That decade also saw the <b>strong</b> <b>growth</b> of racist Heathenry among those incarcerated within the U.S. prison system as a result of outreach programs established by various Heathen groups, a project begun in the 1980s. During this period, many Heathen groups also began to interact increasingly with other ethnic-oriented Pagan groups in Eastern Europe, such as Lithuanian Romuva, and many joined the World Congress of Ethnic Religions upon its formation in 1998.|$|E

From the end of World War II up until the 1970s there was a massive exodus of people from the countryside to the cities of Finland, in particular Helsinki.

25|$|After annexation, Cottage Home {{experienced}} <b>strong</b> <b>growth</b> in housing. Almost 400 households {{were located}} in the area by 1900, nearly three-quarters of which were being rented. Initially, most {{of the residents of}} Cottage Home were immigrant families or African American, though that percentage steadily declined into the twentieth century. Among these early residents was Louisa Magruder, daughter of Tom Magruder, the slave of Gov. Noble who {{is said to be the}} titular inspiration for Uncle Tom's Cabin. This <b>strong</b> <b>growth</b> in housing and population was accompanied by an expansion in the commercial and industrial sectors, due to the neighborhood's proximity to the railroad and streetcar. By 1915, new construction largely ended, and the architectural character of the area was established.|$|E
