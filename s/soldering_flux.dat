50|$|Certain {{manufacturing}} standards, such {{as those}} written by the IPC - Association Connecting Electronics Industries require cleaning regardless of the <b>solder</b> <b>flux</b> type used to ensure a thoroughly clean board.

However, while shops conforming to IPC standard are expected {{to adhere to the}} Association's rules on board condition, not all manufacturing facilities apply IPC standard, nor are they required to do so.

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the specific agent responsible for eczema on the forearms of 2 electronic assemblers who cleaned out a flux-spraying unit once a week. <b>Soldering</b> <b>flux</b> can be a source of skin irritation as well as allergy. Patch test with dried flux residue (as is) and rosin in dilution series of 20 %, 10 %, and 1 % in olive oil was performed. Readings were taken on day 2 and day 3. The rosin in dilution series was negative; however, the flux residue gave a + reaction on day 2, and by day 3 the reaction had weakened (+?). Similar results were obtained in 2 unexposed controls. Patch tests results in our cases indicate that the flux used in the soldering process caused irritant contact dermatitis.

Both subjects have been investigated by means of serial spirometry, peak flow rates, and body plethysmography following inhalation of small amounts of flux fumes; delayed and prolonged bronchoconstriction has been demonstrated. Similar results have been obtained after the inhalation of one of the main constituents of the flux, namely amino-ethyl ethanolamine, which is presumably the active allergic agent. The bronchial response is unusual in being delayed in onset but otherwise resembles pollen-sensitivity asthma rather than the infiltrative process seen in farmer's lung. The type of immune mechanism involved is speculative, but it is possible that some alteration of the amino-ethyl ethanolamine is needed before it can react with reaginic antibody fixed in the bronchial tissues...|$|E

Materials and MethodsA total number of 48 adult male rats were divided into experimental (n= 30) and control (n= 18) groups. Based on exposure time to solder fume, each group was further subdivided into 2, 4 and 6 week subgroups. Rats of experimental groups were exposed to fume in exposure chamber for 1 hour/day (Research Center of Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, 12 Apr 2005 to 14 May 2005). The amount of fumes were measured daily by standard methods. At the end of experiment, lung specimens were collected from each experimental and control subgroups.

40|$|This is {{the final}} part of a study carried out to {{investigate}} occupational asthma due to sensitivity to colophony fumes (a component of <b>soldering</b> <b>flux)</b> in an electronics factory. Fifty-eight workers with occupational asthma employed on the main shop floor were investigated. In them the interval between first exposure and sensitisation varied widely with a group becoming sensitive within {{one to two years}} of first exposure, and another group whose sensitisation was delayed for three to 23 years. Once sensitised the interval between arriving at work and the onset of daily symptoms seemed to be bimodally distributed, resembling the immediate and late asthmatic symptoms seen on provocation testing. Twenty-three out of 58 had no definite daily deterioration at work but improved at the weekends. Wheeze and breathlessness occurred in the evenings at home in most, and one-third were woken by breathlessness at least on some nights. These 58 cases were compared with 48 controls without occupational asthma who had worked on the same shop floor for at least four years. Mean levels of FEV 1 were significantly worse in the cases before exposure on Monday morning. The cases also had {{more than twice as much}} sickness absence as controls. FEV 1 fell by more than 10 % over a working shift in 33 % of cases and 5 % of controls. Atopy (a positive skin prick test to one or more common allergens) and a past history of allergic disease were weakly but significantly associated with being a case.

40|$|Objectives Exposure to {{aluminium}} compounds, such as fluorides in gaseous and particulate form, places {{people who}} work in potrooms at risk for respiratory symptoms. Workers in potrooms, however, also are exposed to a number of other air contaminants. In this study, we present the first report of a dose-response relationship after exposure to potassium aluminium tetrafluoride (KAlF 4) and the influence of smoking and atopy. Materials All workers (308) from an industrial plant that used KA 1 F as <b>soldering</b> <b>flux</b> were {{invited to participate in the}} study. In all, 289 workers participated and 118 employees not exposed to chemicals in their professional work served as an unexposed group. Methods In the first step, all subjects answered a questionnaire concerning respiratory symptoms and work history, and participated in a lung function examination. In a second step, all workers who reported work-related complaints from lower respiratory airways were invited to participate in medical examination, methacholine test, screening test of respiratory allergy, and skin prick test against KAlF 4. Results The exposed subjects had more symptoms than the unexposed group; dry cough odds ratio (OR) : 5. 17 (confidence interval 1. 79 - 15. 0), stuffy nose: 2. 3 (1. 25 - 4. 22), nose bleeding: 10. 7 (3. 26 - 35. 3) and ocular symptoms 5. 01 (1. 92 - 13. 1) except for chest tightening and wheezing, and shortness of breath. The symptoms appeared in a dose response-like manner although the ORs between high and low exposed were significant for only chest tightening and wheezing, 2. 62 (1. 30 - 5. 26) and stuffy nose 2. 1 (1. 22 - 3. 66). Smokers and atopics did not report more frequent work-related symptoms. Smokers were significantly less hyperreactive than non-smokers, indicating a healthy-worker effect.

40|$|ABSTRACT Examination of {{the records}} of {{employees}} leaving an electronics factory over three-and-a-half years showed that a significantly greater proportion left the shop floor (where soldering took place) because of ill health than left the stores and office areas. This difference was largely due to work-related respiratory disease in those whose job was soldering.
