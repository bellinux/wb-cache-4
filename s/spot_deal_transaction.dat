40|$|Hunting for bargains {{has long}} been an {{important}} aspect of shopping behavior. One of the distinctive characteristics of bargain shopping is forward-looking price expectation, where one discount offer is evaluated in relation to another deeper discount anticipated in the future. Two experimental studies examined potentially competing effects of the two discounts over different timing points. Transaction value and purchase intention for the present discount may be affected not only by its discount depth but also by the awareness of the future discount. The negative effect of the future discount could substantially offset the positive perception toward the present deal. On the other hand, the future discount expectation does not appear to lower the perception of acquisition for the present discount. Effects of the future discount were investigated in terms of discount depth, product availability, and discount timing.

40|$|With {{the number}} of online reviews growing rapidly, it is {{increasingly}} difficult to digest all the information within limited time. To help users efficiently get concise information about a product, researchers have studied algorithms for automated opinion summarization. However, users might expect to further read detailed high-quality reviews {{in addition to a}} review outline. This raises another interesting problem not well studied yet: how to discover high quality product reviews? Previous research examined various properties of a product review to predict its quality. In this paper, we further explore this topic by incorporating another information resource: the behavior of review authors in an e-commerce community. First, we perform a high-level analysis on two kinds of data: product reviews and <b>deal</b> <b>transactions.</b> According to the results of this analysis, three features, including personal reputation, seller degree and expertise degree, are studied to assess the quality of a review from a credibility and expertise perspective. Our analysis shows that these features are strongly related to review quality and that they can help uncover review spamming by sellers. Furthermore, we propose a simulation model based on the above findings. The model is able to generate the basic properties of the review community, especially when the above three features are taken into account...|$|R
