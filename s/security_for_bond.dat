40|$|The {{covered bond}} market 1 The covered bond market offers investors an {{alternative}} to developed country government securities. The valuation of covered bonds is complex. While {{there is some evidence}} of differences in the pricing of these bonds by nationality of issuer, these appear to be only weakly related to differences in the respective legislative frameworks. Recent cases show the pricing of covered bonds to be robust to idiosyncratic shocks to issuer credit risk as well as more systemic shocks to the value of cover pools. JEL classification: G 11, G 12, G 15. Over the past decade covered bonds, or securities issued by financial institutions that are secured by dedicated collateral, have become one of the largest asset classes in the European bond market and an important source of finance for mortgage lending.

40|$|Local {{government}} financing vehicles (“LGFVs”) —companies capitalized {{and owned}} by local government and {{established for the}} purpose of raising funds for municipal infrastructure construction—emerged in China in the 1980 s {{as a response to the}} severe constraints on indebtedness by local governments themselves. The mushrooming of their number and indebtedness has sparked fears about their ability to repay the debt and the consequences of a default. In addition to taking on bank debt, a number of LGFVs have also issued bonds. While observers have questioned the value of collateral typically offered as <b>security</b> <b>for</b> the <b>bonds,</b> we know of no extensive analysis to date of the legal quality of the collateral: what exactly are the bondholders being promised, and what is the status of those promises in the Chinese legal system? This article is an attempt to answer that question, using data from two hand-collected samples of LGFV bond prospectuses from different regions in China in two different time periods. We find that current collateralization practices vary a great deal across bond issues and have changed over time, and discuss the legal and other problems attendant upon each type of backup. Remarkably, we find that unlike our initial sample of bond issues, recent bond issues virtually all state explicitly in the prospectus that they carry no security. Thus, the popular image of local governments wildly overpromising with guarantees they are not legally empowered to give seems, at least as far as recent bond issues are concerned, to be wholly wrong. This in turn calls into question the figures commonly provided for local government debt, since they often include LGFV debt that local government is neither legally nor morally obligated to pay. To be sure, they may wish to pay creditors voluntarily, but it is misleading to label as “debt” soft obligations of this nature. Creditors who have tried to force local governments to make good on their guarantees have uniformly failed, at most receiving half of what they sought. The argument that local governments have some politically enforceable obligation to pay on their guarantees does not seem supported by the evidence...|$|R

In return Congress ordered the city to increase charges for city services, to cancel a wage increase for city employees and to drastically reduce {{the number of people in}} its workforce. Rohatyn and the MAC directors persuaded the banks to defer the maturity of the bonds they held and to accept less interest. They also persuaded the city and state employee pension funds to buy MAC bonds to pay off the city's debts. The city government cut its number of employees by 40,000, deferred wage increases already agreed in contracts and kept them below the level of inflation.
