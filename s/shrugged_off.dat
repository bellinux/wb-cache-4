5|$|Several {{universities}} on the West Coast, led by California and Stanford, {{replaced the}} sport with rugby. At the time, {{the future of}} football {{was very much in}} doubt and these schools believed that rugby would eventually be adopted nationwide. Other schools that made the switch included Nevada, St. Mary's, Santa Clara, and USC (in 1911). However, due to the perception that West Coast football was inferior to the game played on the East Coast anyway, East Coast and Midwest teams <b>shrugged</b> <b>off</b> the loss of the teams and continued playing football. With no nationwide movement, the available pool of rugby teams to play remained small. The schools scheduled games against local club teams and reached out to rugby powers in Australia, New Zealand, and especially, due to its proximity, Canada. The annual Big Game between Stanford and California continued as rugby, with the winner invited by the British Columbia Rugby Union to a tournament in Vancouver over the Christmas holidays, with the winner of that tournament receiving the Cooper Keith Trophy.|$|E
25|$|In November 2009, the IAEA's 35-nation Board of Governors {{overwhelmingly}} backed {{a demand}} of the U.S., Russia, China, {{and three other}} powers that Iran immediately stop building its newly revealed nuclear facility and freeze uranium enrichment. Iranian officials <b>shrugged</b> <b>off</b> approval of the resolution by 25 members of the Board, but the U.S. and its allies hinted at new UN sanctions if Iran remained defiant.|$|E

25|$|Quill and {{the union}} {{leadership}} gave their opponents all the ammunition they needed by following {{the changes in the}} CPUSA's foreign policy, moving to a militant policy after the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact in 1939, then coming out against strikes after the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Quill <b>shrugged</b> <b>off</b> most of this criticism from outside, haranguing the Dies Committee when it attempted to question him, and disposed of his internal critics by bringing union charges against more than a hundred opponents.|$|E
25|$|In game one, Ankiel did {{not allow}} a run through the first two innings. His {{performance}} suddenly deteriorated in the third. He allowed four runs on two hits, four walks and throwing five wild pitches before being removed with two outs. Despite Ankiel facing eight batters and throwing 35 pitches, the Cardinals won the game. Ankiel <b>shrugged</b> <b>off</b> the event, joking {{that he was the}} first pitcher to throw five wild pitches in an inning since Bert Cunningham of the Players' League in 1890.|$|E
25|$|The series shifted back to Oakland and {{the raucous}} Oracle Arena crowd, which lifted the Warriors to a resounding blowout in Game 3, a game which saw the Warriors hit a playoff record 11 threes {{in the first}} half. However, the Jazz <b>shrugged</b> <b>off</b> the crowd and handed the Warriors their only playoff home loss {{of the year in}} Game 4. The Warriors' playoff run ended as the Jazz {{finished}} them off in Game 5. The Jazz advanced to the Western Conference Finals {{for the first time since}} 1998.|$|E

25|$|Hamilcar Barca, who {{commanded}} the Carthaginian land forces from 247 BC to 241 BC, probably lacked the manpower {{to take on}} the Roman armies stationed in Sicily. So instead of fighting pitched battles, he simply placed his camp on an unassailable position near the Roman controlled area and launched a harassment campaign. Hamilcar won several minor victories, <b>shrugged</b> <b>off</b> failures and with his immunity to defeat, kept the Carthaginian cause alive. After six years of harassment, the bankrupt and near exhausted Roman state borrowed money from its citizens to create a fleet and defeated the Carthaginians at sea to end the First Punic War.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Ching <b>shrugged</b> <b>off</b> {{injuries}} and national team disappointment to score seven goals and add three assists in 20 games, making 16 starts, {{to win the}} team's Golden Boot for the fourth straight year. His August 21 bicycle kick against Chicago was named ESPNSoccernet.com's MLS Goal of the Year and Dynamo Goal of the Year. He took over as the Dynamo team captain after the retirement of Wade Barrett. He was named as Don Garber's Commissioner's Pick for the 2010 MLS All-Star Game in Houston, a game where he came on as second-half substitute and scored with a header {{to cut the deficit}} to 2-1 vs. Manchester United F.C. The Dynamo missed the playoffs in 2010.|$|E
25|$|This air {{of mystery}} was {{increased}} when CRASH magazine published a reader's photograph of Lunar Jetman featuring Jetman's moon rover pulling a trailer. The possible {{existence of a}} trailer (as depicted on the game's cover art and loading screen) had been speculated on since the game's release, and many fans had searched fruitlessly for it. The Stampers <b>shrugged</b> <b>off</b> questions about whether this screen shot was genuine, but stopped short of actually denying it. There have even been suggestions that Ultimate themselves may have created the screen shot to generate more interest in the game. It has since been proven that Lunar Jetman's 48K of code does not contain graphics for a trailer.|$|E

25|$|He {{considered}} {{standing for}} Parliament {{at the end}} of the war, but the general election was called too early for this to be possible. After the Armistice, he spent the winter of 1918–19 in the Ardennes with his brigade and on 28 March 1919 he transferred to be brigade major of 99th Infantry Brigade. Eden contemplated applying for a regular commission, but they were very hard to come by with the Army contracting so rapidly. He initially <b>shrugged</b> <b>off</b> his mother’s suggestion of studying at Oxford. He also rejected the thought of becoming a barrister; his preferred career alternatives at this stage were standing for Parliament for Bishop Auckland, the Civil Service in East Africa, or the Foreign Office. He was demobilised on 13 June 1919. He retained the rank of captain.|$|E
25|$|In the Old Assyrian Empire, Assyria {{established}} {{colonies in}} Asia Minor and the Levant and, under king Ilushuma, it asserted itself over southern Mesopotamia (what was later to become Babylonia). The first written inscriptions by urbanized Assyrian kings appear c. 2450 BC, {{after they had}} <b>shrugged</b> <b>off</b> Sumerian domination. The land of Assyria as a whole then consisted {{of a number of}} city-states and small Semitic-speaking kingdoms, some of which were initially independent of Assyria. The foundation of the first major temple in the city of Aššur was traditionally ascribed to king Ushpia who reigned c. 2050 BC, possibly a contemporary of Ishbi-Erra of Isin and Naplanum of Larsa. He was reputedly succeeded by kings named Apiashal, Sulili, Kikkiya and Akiya (died c. 2026 BC), of whom little is known, apart from much later mentions of Kikkiya conducting fortifications on the city walls, and building work on temples in Aššur.|$|E
25|$|In the ebook The Third Law, Rico Dredd as narrator {{tells the}} reader {{that he was trying}} to enforce the law in a less remote fashion, {{allowing}} for mercy and accepting the citizens as they were; bribes are explained as a way of making sure the crime lords believed they controlled him and he wasn't the one ensuring they kept restrained. Sex and drinking are <b>shrugged</b> <b>off</b> as perks, and threats to Joe as being the result of drinking. Rico is implied to be an unreliable narrator and this calls his claims into question. Notably, he claims he couldn't shoot Kenner in case the bullets were traced and he used the rad pit to kill him, and regretted 'having' to kill him; the original strip shows him hitting Kenner with an incendary round, shooting his limbs, and mocking him as he dies, using the rad pit to dispose of the corpse. The ebook Wear Iron is told in third-person and describes Rico's thoughts circa 2080: here, when he isn't telling his own story, he's callous, brutal, and sometimes bursts out in manic laughter. He remembers Kenner's murder fondly.|$|E

25|$|Heinze's first book, Adapting to Abundance: Jewish Immigrants, Mass Consumption, and the Search for American Identity, was {{published}} in 1990. It was the first full-length study {{of the impact of}} American consumer culture on an immigrant group. Hasia Diner, Professor of History at New York University, said about Heinze: “Historians of immigration and Jewish history will be indebted to him for opening up whole areas of behavior which they previously <b>shrugged</b> <b>off</b> as irrelevant.” The Journal of Consumer Affairs remarked upon the variety of topics that the book explored: the rise of ad campaigns for major American products in the foreign-language press; the rise of the summer vacation among working people; installment-buying as a way for working families to obtain expensive furnishings such as pianos; the role of Jewish women as agents of assimilation through their control over family purchases; and the way that American abundance altered religious rituals, especially holidays such as Chanukah and Passover. Adapting to Abundance established Heinze's reputation as part of a scholarly vanguard that produced the first histories of mass consumption in Europe and America. It is widely referenced in books, articles and syllabi around the world.|$|E
500|$|At {{the podium}} {{ceremony}} following the race, Hamilton was booed by the crowd. In the podium interview, conducted by Spanish TV presenter Noemi de Miguel, he <b>shrugged</b> <b>off</b> the reaction, saying: [...] "That's not my problem, it's theirs." [...] Both Hamilton and Verstappen expressed delight at their result, while Räikkönen {{said that it}} had not been an easy day for the team, stressing that Ferrari had not achieved what they could have, since he felt that he could have overtaken Verstappen towards the end. Hamilton's win was the 250th victory by a British driver in Formula One and his first at the Spielberg circuit.|$|E

We'll build the success at Glenbrook North." [...] His father said: [...] "I get chills thinking about it. [...] That wasn't my vision. [...] It wasn't Laury's. It wasn't his coaches'.

500|$|Davies {{would later}} comment in his autobiography, X-Ray, that Anning later [...] "told {{me that he}} ... knew it [...] had been partly {{inspired}} by him ... reminded him of home ... I told Arthur that I felt guilty for using him as a subject for a song, but he <b>shrugged</b> <b>off</b> my apology, {{saying that he was}} flattered." [...] With an underlying theme of nostalgia, the songs describe the England that Arthur once knew ("Victoria", [...] "Young and Innocent Days"), the promise of life in Australia for one of his sons ("Australia"), the emptiness of his superficially comfortable life in his home ("Shangri-La"), the resolve of the British people during the Second World War ("Mr. Churchill Says"), the privations that marked the austerity period after the war ("She's Bought a Hat Like Princess Marina"), and the death of his brother in World War I ("Yes Sir, No Sir", [...] "Some Mother's Son").|$|E
500|$|In {{the third}} round of the Football League Cup, Arsenal faced Manchester United at Highbury. With both {{managers}} making several first team changes to give their younger and fringe players game time, it was Arsenal who came out on top, with Wiltord scoring a hat-trick. A 2–0 win against First Division outfit Grimsby Town, who knocked out competition holders Liverpool in the previous round followed, but Arsenal was eliminated in the fifth round, losing 4–0 to Blackburn Rovers on 11 December 2001. Wenger <b>shrugged</b> <b>off</b> the significance of the defeat and suggested that a spot in Europe, given to the winners of the competition, should instead be allocated to the Premier League: [...] "I would give one more place to the championship because it's more difficult to play in the championship. But, {{as long as there is}} a European place at stake, we will play in the competition." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{scabrous}} lyrics—"God {{save the}} Queen/She ain't no human being/There is no future/In England's dreaming"—prompted widespread outcry. Several major chains refused to stock the single. It was banned {{not only by}} the BBC but also by every independent radio station, making it the [...] "most heavily censored record in British history". That week, there was no number 1 hit in Britain, according to Lydon, et al. in The Filth and The Fury; the top spot was empty, because so many radio stations, the BBC, and individuals protested the song's content. Rotten boasted, [...] "We're the only honest band that's hit this planet in about two thousand million years." [...] Jones <b>shrugged</b> <b>off</b> everything the song stated and implied—or took nihilism to a logical endpoint: [...] "I don't see how anyone could describe us as a political band. I don't even know the name of the Prime Minister." [...] The song, and its public impact, are now recognised as [...] "punk's crowning glory".|$|E

2500|$|Skeptics, {{especially}} those critical of artificial intelligence and {{more inclined to}} believe that risk of bodily harm and bodily action are the basis of all unity between people, {{are more likely to}} emphasize the capacity of a group to take action and withstand harm as one fluid mass mobilization, <b>shrugging</b> <b>off</b> harms the way a body <b>shrugs</b> <b>off</b> the loss of a few cells. This strain of thought is most obvious in the anti-globalization movement and characterized by the works of John Zerzan, Carol Moore, and Starhawk, who typically shun academics. These theorists are more likely to refer to ecological and collective wisdom and to the role of consensus process in making ontological distinctions than to any form of [...] "intelligence" [...] as such, which they often argue does not exist, or is mere [...] "cleverness".|$|R
