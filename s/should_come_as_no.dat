Sestak's victory was seen as a minor embarrassment for Obama, who strongly and publicly advocated for Specter during the race. Several news outlets reflected that Sestak's television advertisements condemning Specter as a hypocrite and opportunist were especially effective and may have been the primary factor in his victory. The Washington Post said the Pennsylvania race drew more attention than any other primary election in 2010 due to Specter's longevity and his switch to the Democratic party.|$|E

Fred Inglis considers Blyton's books to be technically easy to read, but to also be [...] "emotionally and cognitively easy". He mentions that the psychologist Michael Woods believed that Blyton was different from many other older authors writing for children in that she seemed untroubled by presenting them with a world that differed from reality. Woods surmised that Blyton [...] "was a child, she thought as a child, and wrote as a child... the basic feeling is essentially pre-adolescent... Enid Blyton has no moral dilemmas...

40|$|Abstract It is {{agreed that}} US–Russian {{relations}} today {{are in a}} crisis. This article seeks {{a better understanding of}} the current US–Russian relationship by examining its origins. Russia and the United States have always had conflicting interests as great powers, as the realist school would argue. Opportunities for cooperation were also constrained by longstanding ideological differences neglected by structural realism. Nevertheless, Russian–American relations from 1781 to 1824 were conducted according to realistic assessments of national interests, and in America, Russia was perceived as a friendly power. However, by the late nineteenth century ideological currents in American political culture reversed this favorable image of Russia. Negative perceptions peaked during the Cold War – and have survived the collapse of communism. It <b>should</b> thus <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>no</b> surprise that Russia and the United States in the early part of the twenty-first century are capable of conducting diplomacy based on notions of power and interests.

The confluence of environment and biology guarantees that virtually all children acquire major aspects of everyday mathematics (EM). Children’s EM is ubiquitous, often competent, and more complex than usually assumed. It involves activities as diverse as perceiving which of two plates of cookies has “more ” and reflecting on the issue of what is the largest number. It <b>should</b> therefore <b>come</b> <b>as</b> <b>no</b> surprise that EM is a significant aspect of children’s play. Children use informal skills and ideas relating to number, shape, and pattern as they play with blocks or read storybooks. Indeed, EM provides the cognitive foundation for a good deal of play, as well as for other aspects of the child’s life. Even more remarkably, spontaneous play may entail explicit mathematical content: young children can enjoy explorations of number and pattern as much as messing around with clay. Further, children also play with the teacher’s mathematics—the lessons taught in school. Research on EM provides guidelines for the goals, content, and nature of early childhood mathematics education. If we create and employ a challenging and playful mathematics curriculum, then, as the title of this book suggests, play can indeed produce learning—even mathematics learning. ...|$|R
