50|$|Fenthion is {{a contact}} and <b>stomach</b> <b>insecticide</b> used against many biting insects. It is {{particularly}} effective against fruit flies, leaf hoppers, cereal bugs, stem borers, mosquitoes, animal parasites, mites, aphids, codling moths, and weaver birds. It {{has been widely}} used in sugar cane, rice, field corn, beets, pome and stone fruit, citrus fruits, pistachio, cotton, olives, coffee, cocoa, vegetables, and vines.|$|E
5000|$|Mirex is a <b>stomach</b> <b>insecticide,</b> {{meaning that}} it must be {{ingested}} by the organism in order to poison it. The insecticidal use was focused on Southeastern United States to control the imported fire ants Solenopsis saevissima richteri and Solenopsis invicta. Approximately 250,000 kg of mirex was applied to fields between 1962-75 (US NRC, 1978). Most of the mirex was in the form of [...] "4X mirex bait," [...] which consists of 0.3% mirex in 14.7% soybean oil mixed with 85% corncob grits. Application of the 4X bait was designed to give a coverage of 4.2 g mirex/ha and was delivered by aircraft, helicopter or tractor. 1x and 2x bait were also used. Use of mirex as a pesticide was banned in 1978. The Stockholm Convention banned production and use of several persistent organic pollutant, and Mirex is one of the [...] "dirty dozen".|$|E
40|$|Seeds {{are treated}} with {{insecticides}} to provide the developing plant with a comprehensive and long-lasting protection against insect pests living in the soil and aboveground. Various conditions must be fulfilled {{in order to achieve}} this goal. Whereas ideal protection against soil insects is given by a contact action of the insecticide, for protection of the plant organs aboveground systemic active ingredients are required, which after uptake and translocation in the plant act as a <b>stomach</b> <b>insecticide.</b> For long-term protection, it is necessary that the active ingredient should be present in the soil for a considerable period and in sufficient concentrations close to the plant organs to be protected and it should be available both for action against soil insects as well as for uptake into the plant. Furthermore, the insecticide should display a broad range of activity, an adequate safety margin between the effective and phytotoxic dose at the seed grain and also good compatibility with other substances such as fungicides, pelleting material etc. (orig.)

50|$|The bagworm has a {{voracious}} {{appetite and}} is considered a serious pest. Host trees develop damaged foliage that will kill the tree if left unchecked. If caught early enough in an infestation, the cases {{from the previous year}} can be picked off by hand before the end of May. They are easiest to detect in the fall after their cases have turned brown, especially on evergreen trees. Various bacterial sprays such as Bt/Spinosad and <b>stomach</b> <b>insecticides</b> such as carbaryl (Sevin) are used to control infestations.|$|R
25|$|Most years, natural pests keep weevil {{populations in}} check - parasites {{sometimes}} destroy {{more than half}} the pupae populations. It has been noted that parasite control may fail every several years. There are also chemical controls available {{that can be used to}} eliminate adults and larvae. One should apply contact or <b>stomach</b> <b>insecticides</b> as soon as the first adult feeding spots are noticed on host leaves. A rule of thumb is to apply the insecticide when feeding damage accumulates to 10% or more throughout foliage. Since the spring adults feed and move during April to early June, a second application may be needed. Systemics are used to combat larvae. It is best to apply systemics when the eggs have just been laid or while larval mines are green in color.|$|R
40|$|The currant fruit fly, Epochra canadensis Loew, {{a native}} insect, is an {{important}} factor limiting the production of currants and gooseberries in the greater part of Canada, and in parts of the United States of America. Studies have shown this insect to be vulnerable in the adult stage to <b>stomach</b> and contact <b>insecticides.</b> Investigations to control the adult fly with contact and <b>stomach</b> <b>insecticides</b> have culminated in the recommendation of DDT (Andison et al 1951). The possible destruction of the maggot and emerging adult with contact insecticides, and the immobile pupae with soil fumigants, has received attention by some workers, but without any notable success. The development of newer soil fumigants and insecticides has provided opportunity for further study on this phase of the control problem. The present paper presents results obtainad from the use of the fumigants ethylene dibromide and DD and the insecticides BHO and dieldrin, tested in the laboratory, against dormant currant fruit fly pupae, and the insecticides BHC, DDT, and chlordane, tested in the laboratory, against the larvae entering the soil. The fumigant ethylene dibromide was further tested in the field against dormant, prediapausing and diapausing pupae at different rates, depths, and under conditions of cultivation and no cultivation. The affect of the soil temperature and soil moisture on the efficacy of ethylene dibromide was considered. [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|Naled is a fast acting, non-systemic {{contact and}} <b>stomach</b> {{organophosphate}} <b>insecticide.</b> It {{is used to}} control aphids, mites, mosquitoes, and flies on crops and in greenhouses, mushroom houses, animal and poultry houses, kennels, food processing plants, and aquaria and in outdoor mosquito control. Liquid formulations {{can be applied to}} greenhouse heating pipes to kill insects by vapor action. Veterinarians have used naled to kill parasitic worms (other than tapeworms) in dogs. Naled is a general use pesticide (GUP). Naled is available in dust, emulsion concentrate, liquid, and ultra-low volume (ULV) formulations. Naled is classified toxicity category I. Products containing naled bear the signal words, “Danger-Poison ” because it is corrosive to the eyes. Naled belongs to the organophosphate chemical class.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} by greenhouse producers that adding sugar to a <b>stomach</b> poison <b>insecticide</b> enhances {{the efficacy of the}} insecticide in controlling western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis). As such, a series of laboratory, including no-choice and multiple-choice assays, and greenhouse experiments were conducted to determine if adding sugar-based compounds to insecticides enhances efficacy against western flower thrips. The sugar-based compounds evaluated were Mountain Dew, Diet Mountain Dew, white sugar, and brown sugar at two rates [initial (0. 18 mL/ 100 mL and 0. 12 g/ 100 mL) and high (0. 36 mL/ 100 mL and 0. 24 g/ 100 mL) ]. A water control was also included in all the assays. In the laboratory experiments, western flower thrips adults and nymphs were not attracted to any of the sugar-based compounds with < 60 s (out of 300 s total) spent in any of the treatments, and ≤ 29 s (out of 300 s total) spent in the treatments when the sugar-based compounds were mixed with three insecticides (tau-fluvalinate, pyridalyl, and spinosad). In the greenhouse experiments, the addition of the high rate of Mountain Dew (0. 36 mL/ 100 mL) and brown sugar (0. 24 g/ 100 mL) did not enhance the efficacy (based on percent mortality) of the insecticides against western flower thrips. There {{was no significant difference between}} the individual insecticide treatments and the mixtures with either Mountain Dew or brown sugar. This study is the first to quantitatively demonstrate that western flower thrips adults and nymphs are not attracted to sugar-based compounds and that it is not warranted to add these types of materials to spray solutions targeted for control of western flower thrips...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{evaluate}} {{the risk of}} the stomach and oesophageal adenocarcinomas associated with farming and agricultural pesticide use. Methods: Population based case-control study in eastern Nebraska. Telephone interviews were conducted with men and women diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the stomach (n = 170) or oesophagus (n = 137) between 1988 and 1993, and controls (n = 502) randomly selected from the same geographical area. Unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for farming and for use of individual and chemical classes of insecticides and herbicides, including pesticides classified as nitrosatable (able to form N-nitroso compounds on reaction with nitrite). Non-farmers were used as the reference category for all analyses. Results: Ever living or working on a farm, duration of farming, and size of the farm were not associated with stomach or oesophageal adenocarcinomas. There was no association for either cancer with ever-use of <b>insecticides</b> (<b>stomach</b> OR 0. 9, 95 % CI 0. 6 to 1. 4; oesophagus OR 0. 7, 95 % CI 0. 4 to 1. 1) or herbicides (stomach OR 0. 9, 95 % CI 0. 5 to 1. 4; oesophagus OR 0. 7, 95 % CI 0. 4 to 1. 2). Likewise, individual pesticides, including individual nitrosatable pesticides, were not significantly associated with risk. Conclusions: No significant associations were found between specific agricultural pesticide exposures and the risk of stomach or oesophageal adenocarcinomas among Nebraska farmers...|$|R
