They include short chain oligo-saccharide polymers of fructose (fructans) and galactooligosaccharides (GOS, <b>stachyose,</b> raffinose), disaccharides (lactose), monosaccharides (fructose), and sugar alcohols (polyols), such as sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol and maltitol.|$|E
50|$|A {{tetrasaccharide}} is a carbohydrate {{which gives}} upon hydrolysis four molecules {{of the same}} or different monosaccharides.

These solids {{consist of}} carbohydrates (60%), proteins and other nitrogenous substances (10%), minerals (10%), fats and lipoids (20%). The major constituents of soy molasses are sugars that include oligosaccharides (<b>stachyose</b> and raffinose), disaccharides (sucrose) and minor amounts of monosaccharides (fructose and glucose). Minor constituents include saponins, protein, lipid, minerals (ash), isoflavones, and other organic materials.|$|E

5000|$|Seeds: {{the seeds}} are mature when the capsule changes from green to yellow. The seeds contain around 20% {{saturated}} fatty acids and 80% un{{saturated fatty acids}}, and they yield 25%-40% oil by weight. In addition, the seeds contain other chemical compounds, such as saccharose, raffinose, <b>stachyose,</b> glucose, fructose, galactose, and protein. The oil is largely made up of oleic and linoleic acids. Furthermore, the plant also contains curcasin, arachidic, myristic, palmitic, and stearic acids and curcin.|$|E
50|$|Many edible beans, {{including}} {{broad beans}} and soybeans, contain oligosaccharides (particularly raffinose and <b>stachyose),</b> {{a type of}} sugar molecule also found in cabbage. An anti-oligosaccharide enzyme is necessary to properly digest these sugar molecules. As a normal human digestive tract does not contain any anti-oligosaccharide enzymes, consumed oligosaccharides are typically digested by bacteria in the large intestine. This digestion process produces flatulence-causing gases as a byproduct. Since sugar dissolves in water, another method of reducing flatulence associated with eating beans is to drain the water in which the beans have been cooked.|$|E
5000|$|Desiccation {{tolerance}} in maturing seeds {{involves the}} accumulation of non-reducing galactosyl sucrose oligosaccharides such as <b>stachyose</b> and raffinose. These galactosyl sucrose oligosaccharides cause flatulence in animals and human beings [...] because human beings {{do not have the}} enzyme, α-galactosidase to cleave the α-galactosyl linkage. Consequently, the intact galactosyl sucrose oligosaccharide is not absorbed by the digestive tract and the bacteria in the colon use it as a substrate that results in gas formation. As a result of the relationship found between the oligosaccharides and flatulence, the Protein Advisory Group of the United Nations has recommended that the elimination of flatulence associated with the consumption of foods be one of the research priorities. However, Obendorf found that {{the accumulation of}} the flatulence-producing oligosaccharides is required for seed germinability and seed desiccation tolerance. Thus the elimination of the flatulence-producing oligosaccharides from seeds would result in a deterioration of the crop that produces them. According to Obendorf, Breeding seed plants for quality embryos emphasizes elimination of flatulence-producing oligosaccharides. Before this effort proceeds too far, we need to determine if the flatulence-producing maturation sugars are required for desiccation tolerance and storability of seed germplasm, the threshold level required, and if biosynthesis of the <b>stachyose</b> series oligosaccharides and/or oligogalactocyclitols can be regulated genetically and biochemically in parallel with altered desiccation tolerance and storability of seed germplasm.|$|E
50|$|Prebiotics are {{carbohydrates}} {{which are}} indigestible for the host animal. On the other hand, they are selectively fermented by beneficial gut bacteria and, therefore, support a healthy gut microflora. These include fructose oligosaccharides (FOS) including inulin, transgalactose oligosaccharides (GOS), xylooligosaccharides (XOS) and soy oligosaccharides such as <b>stachyose,</b> verbose and raffinose. Mannan oligosaccharides are sometimes included as prebiotics {{but are not}} fermentable. This was confirmed by Smiricky-Tjardes et al. at the University of Illinois and so might be more appropriately termed immunosaccharides since they act as decoys for pathogen attachment (Salmonella and E. Coli) and result in increased immunoglobulins (IgAs) at intestinal level.|$|E

50|$|Phloem loading is {{the process}} of loading carbon into the phloem for {{transport}} to different 'sinks' in a plant. Sinks include metabolism, growth, storage, and other processes or organs that need carbon solutes to persist. It can be a passive process, relying on a pressure gradient to generate diffusion of solutes through the symplast, or an active process, requiring energy to create membrane-bound transporter proteins that move solutes through the apoplast against a gradient. Passive phloem loading transports solutes freely through plasmodesma in the symplast of the minor veins of leaves. Active transport occurs apoplastically and does not use plasmodesmata. An intermediate type of loading exists that uses symplastic transport but utilizes a size-exclusion mechanism to ensure diffusion is a one-way process between the mesophyll and phloem cells. This process is referred to as polymer-trapping, in which simple solutes such as sucrose are synthesized into larger molecules such as <b>stachyose</b> or raffinose in intermediary cells. The larger molecules cannot diffuse back to the mesophyll but can move into the phloem's sieve cells. Therefore, the synthesis of larger compounds uses energy and is thus 'active' but this strategy does not require specialized proteins and can still move symplastically.|$|E
5000|$|Their {{carbohydrate}} content compares {{with that of}} wheat and rice; chestnuts have twice as much starch as the potato on an as-is basis. In addition, chestnuts contain about 8% of various sugars, mainly sucrose, glucose, fructose, and, in a lesser amount, <b>stachyose</b> and raffinose, which are fermented in the lower gut, producing gas. In some areas, sweet chestnut trees are called [...] "the bread tree". When chestnuts {{are just starting to}} ripen, the fruit is mostly starch and is very firm under finger pressure from the high water content. As the chestnuts ripen, the starch is slowly converted into sugars, and moisture content also starts decreasing. Upon pressing the chestnut, a slight 'give' can be felt; the hull is not so tense, and space occurs between it and the flesh of the fruit. They are the only [...] "nuts" [...] that contain vitamin C, with about 40 mg per 100 g of raw product, which is about 65% of the U.S. recommended daily intake. The amount of vitamin C decreases by about 40% after heating. Fresh chestnuts contain about 52% water by weight, which evaporates relatively quickly during storage; they can lose as much as 1% of weight in one day at 20 °C (68 °F) and 70% relative humidity.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effects of resistant starch 3 (RS 3) as a carrier for <b>stachyose</b> on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) -induced colitis in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. RS 3 microspheres carrying <b>stachyose</b> (RS 3 + <b>stachyose)</b> were produced and evaluated as a potentially improved colitis therapy for this study. The body weights of the mice treated with RS 3 + <b>stachyose</b> were higher compared with those of DSS-treated control mice. RS 3 + <b>stachyose</b> reduced the levels of the serum pro-inflammatory cytokines IL- 6 and TNF-α to a greater extent compared with the same concentration of <b>stachyose</b> combined with ordinary starch (<b>stachyose</b> + starch). Histopathological examination of sections of colon tissues showed that the RS 3 + <b>stachyose</b> group recovered well from colitis; however, the tissue sections of the <b>stachyose</b> + starch group presented necrosis to a more serious degree. These results suggest that <b>stachyose</b> with an RS 3 carrier has better preventative effects on colitis than <b>stachyose</b> alone in mice...|$|E

The uptake of <b>stachyose</b> by these vacuoles was examined and {{compared with that of}} sucrose. The uptake mechanisms of both sugars were quite similar. The kinetics showed a single saturable response to increasing external concentrations of 14 C-sugars with similar apparent Km values of about 50 and 30 millimolar for <b>stachyose</b> and sucrose, respectively. The uptake rates, however, were always higher for <b>stachyose</b> than for sucrose. <b>Stachyose</b> and sucrose uptake was inhibited by fructose and raffinose, and, reciprocally, by sucrose and <b>stachyose,</b> but not by glucose or galactose. The main structural feature common to all sugars recognized by the uptake systems seems to be a terminal fructosyl residue. The uptake of both sugars was stimulated by Mg-ATP and inorganic pyrophosphate, suggesting a proton-sugar antiport system.

40|$|Soybean (Glycine max) {{has high}} levels of protein. Furthermore, it also {{contains}} raffinose and <b>stachyose,</b> which in high amounts can lead to flatulence.

The study was conducted by using combination of R. oryzae and L. plantarum isolates in soybean fermentation process in different length of time. The levels of raffinose and <b>stachyose</b> on fermented soybean products then tested. The results of this study showed that fermentation using R. oryzae single isolates for 2 days (R 2 L 0) can produce soybean flour with low levels of raffinose and <b>stachyose.</b>   The products also have good color and smell. </em...|$|E
40|$|Background: Nutritional and absorption-promoting {{properties}} of <b>stachyose</b> combined with tea catechins (TC) have been revealed. However, the mechanism involved in non-digestible oligosaccharides-mediated enhancement of flavonoid absorption has largely remained elusive. Methods: This {{study was designed}} to investigate the molecular mechanism of <b>stachyose</b> in enhancing absorption and transportation of TC in mice. Mice were orally pre-treated with <b>stachyose</b> (50, 250, and 500 mg/kg·bw) for 0 – 8 weeks, and 1 h before sacrifice, mice were treated with TC (250 mg/kg·bw). Results: Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis showed that serum concentrations of epicatechin, epigallocatechin, epicatechin gallate, and epigallocatechin gallate were dose- and time-dependently elevated with <b>stachyose</b> pre-treatment in mice. Furthermore, pre-treatment with <b>stachyose</b> in mice reduced intestinal sulfotransferase and uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase levels by 3. 3 – 43. 2 % and 23. 9 – 30. 4 %, relative to control mice, respectively. Moreover, intestinal P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance-associated protein- 1 contents were decreased in mice by pre-administration of <b>stachyose</b> in dose- and time-dependent manner. Conclusions: This is the first time to demonstrate that suppression of Phase II metabolic enzymes and efflux transporters of TC in the intestine can {{play a major role in}} increasing absorption of TC by <b>stachyose</b> feeding...|$|E

The amounts of <b>stachyose</b> isolated from leaf tissues, and the extractable activity of galactinol synthase, were somewhat higher in leaf tissues obtained from plants operating in the Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) mode (well watered plants) compared to leaf tissues from plants operating in the CAM-idling mode (water-stressed plants). In contrast, in leaf discs, the photosynthetic incorporation of label into <b>stachyose</b> following pulse labeling with 14 CO 2 was similar for stressed and for nonstressed tissues. <b>Stachyose</b> could be extracted from, and was synthesized photosynthetically by, leaf discs which contained no vascular tissues, indicating that synthesis of <b>stachyose</b> can occur in photosynthetic mesophyll cells of Xerosicyos...|$|E
40|$|Oligosaccharides are an {{important}} component of soybean [(L.) Merr. ] meal in terms of metabolizable energy for monogastric animals. Sucrose, raffinose, and <b>stachyose</b> are the three main oligosaccharides present in soybean meal. Of the three, only sucrose is nutritionally useful. When raffinose and <b>stachyose</b> are fermented by microbes present in the gut, the results are flatulence and discomfort, which ultimately lead to poor weight gain. The long term objective of this research is ultimately to increase the nutritional value of soybean meal by elevating the metabolizable energy at the expense of raffinose and <b>stachyose</b> through the manipulation of soybean raffinose synthase, the key enzyme for raffinose and <b>stachyose</b> biosynthesis. The objectives of this work were to develop molecular genetic information about soybean raffinose synthases and to evaluate the candidate raffinose synthase genes in a soybean germplasm accession (PI 200508) that contains low levels of raffinose and <b>stachyose.</b> Our results indicate the soybean genome contains at least two expressed genes similar to other characterized raffinose synthases. A novel allele of one of these putative soybean raffinose synthase genes was discovered from the PI 200508 that completely associates with the low raffinose and <b>stachyose</b> phenotype. Molecular marker assays specific for the PI 200508 allele were developed to allow direct selection for the low raffinose and low <b>stachyose</b> phenotype...|$|E
40|$|Raffinose family {{oligosaccharides}} (RFOs) are synthesized {{by a set}} of galactosyltransferases, which sequentially add galactose {{units from}} galactinol to sucrose. The accumulation of RFOs was studied in maturing seeds of two pea (Pisum sativum) lines with contrasting RFO composition. Seeds of the line SD 1 accumulated <b>stachyose</b> as the predominant RFO, whereas verbascose, the next higher homolog of <b>stachyose,</b> was almost absent. In seeds of the line RRRbRb, a high level of verbascose was accumulated alongside with <b>stachyose.</b> The increase in verbascose in developing RRRbRb seeds was associated with galactinol-dependent verbascose synthase activity. In addition, a galactinol-independent enzyme activity was detected, which catalyzed transfer of a galactose residue from one <b>stachyose</b> molecule to another. The two enzyme activities synthesizing verbascose showed an optimum at pH 7. 0. Both activities were almost undetectable in SD 1. Maximum activity of <b>stachyose</b> synthase was about 4 -fold higher in RRRbRb compared with SD 1, whereas the activities of galactinol synthase and raffinose synthase were only about 1. 5 -fold higher in RRRbRb. The levels of galactinol synthase and <b>stachyose</b> synthase activity were reflected by steady-state levels of corresponding mRNAs.
