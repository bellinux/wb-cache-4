On the other hand, for tablets prepared from alpha-lactose monohydrate, where the rate of water penetration plays a paramount role in the disintegration process, the disintegration time depends on the origin of the starch in the <b>sodium</b> starch <b>glycolate.</b> The disintegration time decreased with an increase of the rate of water penetration into the disintegrant particles. The differences in water penetration rates into the <b>sodium</b> starch <b>glycolate</b> particles were attributed to differences in chemical composition, crystallinity and particle size of the starches from which the <b>sodium</b> starch <b>glycolates</b> were prepared...|$|R

The influence of concentration of the <b>Sodium</b> Starch <b>Glycolate</b> was studied by a set of four formulations (F 1, F 2, F 3, F 4) with concentrations of <b>Sodium</b> Starch <b>Glycolate</b> viz, 2 %, 3 %, 4 % & 5 %w/w respectively. Also the influence of various superdisintegrants was studied by a set of three formulations (F 4, F 5 and F 6) with three superdisintegrants viz, Sodium Starch Glycolate(5 %), Croscarmellose sodium(5 %), Crospovidone (5 %) respectively. The formulation prepared with 5 %w/w of <b>sodium</b> starch <b>glycolate</b> was offered relatively rapid release of Simvastatin n when compared with other concentrations of <b>Sodium</b> Starch <b>Glycolate.</b> The formulation prepared with Crospovidone was offered relatively rapid release of Simvastatin when compared with other superdisintegrants.

40|$|The {{solubilities}} {{of seven}} sodium salts of organic acids that {{are thought to}} exist in high-level waste at the Hanford Site were measured in tank supernatant simulant solutions during FY 1997. This solubility information {{will be used to}} determine if these organic salts could exist in solid phases (saltcake or sludges) in the waste where they might react violently with the nitrate or nitrite salts present in the tanks. The solubility of sodium acetate was measured in simulated waste supernate solutions at 25 C, 30 C, 40 C, and 50 C that were both unsaturated and saturated with sodium nitrate. Solubilities of <b>sodium</b> <b>glycolate,</b> citrate, ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA), nitrilotriacetate (NTA), formate, and oxalate were measured in simulated waste supernate solutions that were saturated with sodium nitrate. In addition, solubilities of sodium EDTA, citrate, glycolate, and NTA were measured in a complex waste matrix. The organic compounds were selected because they are expected to exist in relatively high concentrations in the tanks. The solubilities of <b>sodium</b> <b>glycolate</b> citrate, EDTA, NTA, and formate were high over the temperature and sodium hydroxide concentration ranges expected in the tanks. The solubility of sodium oxalate in solutions saturated with sodium nitrate were quite low. The presence of additional sodium in the waste simulant solutions that were saturated with sodium nitrate slightly lowered the solubilities of each of the organic salts. Solubilities were, however, high enough to prevent solid sodium salts of all the organic acids from precipitating from tank supernate solutions, except for sodium oxalate. The total organic carbon concentrations (TOC) of actual tank supernates are generally much lower than the TOC ranges for the simulated supernate solutions saturated (at the solubility limit) with the organic salts. This is true even if all the dissolved carbon in a given tank supernate is due to only one of these soluble compounds (an unlikely situation). Solubilities of all the organic salts, except for glycolate, decrease with increasing sodium hydroxide and sodium nitrate concentration because of the common ion effect of Na+. <b>Sodium</b> <b>glycolate</b> solubility increased with increasing hydroxide concentration. The complex waste solutions had sodium ion concentrations 3. 4 to 7. 0 molar higher than unsaturated solutions. This caused a significant lowering of the solubilities of the organic sodium salts due to the common ion effect of sodium. Results of EDTA adsorption measurements show that EDTA or EDTA-metal complexes can be adsorbed onto hydrous metal oxides (that make up the sludge layers in the tanks) under conditions simulating the high-level waste tanks. The extent of adsorption is not large and depends on the concentration of hydroxide in the waste solutions. Higher hydroxide concentrations lower adsorption of EDTA. Adsorption also depends on the type of metal hydrous oxide present. Adsorption data for Fe(III), Cr(III), and NI(IV) hydrous oxides show that chromium(III) hydrous oxide adsorbs EDTA most effectively...|$|E

Therefore, {{the aim of the}} present research was to engineer ibuprofen crystals in the presence of two disintegrants (starch and <b>sodium</b> starch <b>glycolate)</b> in order to improve its flow, compactibility and dissolution behaviour simultaneously. To this end ibuprofen and different concentrations of disintegrant (0. 25 to 10 % w/w in case of starch and 0. 25 to 7 % w/w in case of <b>sodium</b> starch <b>glycolate)</b> were dissolved in ethanol and water respectively. The ibuprofen solution was then added to the aqueous solutions containing the different concentrations of disintegrant. Ibuprofen precipitated within 10 min and the crystals were separated and dried for further studies. The obtained crystals were characterized in terms of flow, density, tablet hardness, dissolution behaviour and solid state. The results showed most of engineered ibuprofen to have better flow with a high compactibility. The results also showed that an increase in the concentration of starch in the crystallization medium resulted in a reduction in the hardness of ibuprofen tablets, but {{this was not the case}} for ibuprofen samples engineered in the presence of <b>sodium</b> starch <b>glycolate.</b> It is interesting to note that although engineered ibuprofen showed superior dissolution as compared to untreated ibuprofen, the highest concentration of starch (10 %) or <b>sodium</b> starch <b>glycolate</b> (7 %) slowed down the release remarkably due to an increase in the viscosity of the dissolution medium around drug particles. Solid state analysis (FT-IR, XRPD and DSC) ruled out the presence of different polymorphic forms and also any interaction between these disintegrants and ibuprofen. In conclusion, the engineering of ibuprofen in the presence of disintegrant showed how properties such as flow, compaction and dissolution behaviour can be simultaneously manipulated to suit a desired application...|$|R

40|$|Metoclopramide an {{effective}} antiemetic; {{acting on the}} CTZ, blocks apomorphine induced vomiting. Rapidly disintegrating tablets of metoclopramide hydrochloride were prepared by mass extrusion technique using three different superdisintegrants <b>Sodium</b> Starch <b>Glycolate,</b> Avicel Ph 102, L-HPC. Pre-compression parameters and postcompression parameters were evaluated for all the nine formulations. Angle of repose and % compressibility showed good flowability in all the formulations. Weight variation was found within limits and drug content of all the formulations {{was found in the}} range of 9. 700 mg - 9. 925 mg in each tablet. The hardness of all the formulations was almost uniform and possessed good mechanical strength with sufficient hardness. The wetting time in all the formulation was fast. Formulations F 3 containing <b>sodium</b> starch <b>glycolate</b> 10 % & F 6 containing Avicel ph 102 10 % tablets disintegrated rapidly to release the drug. In vitro release studies revealed that 96 % of drug releases from SSG, MCC (90 %), and L-HPC (85 %) for all the formulations were within 15 min. Based on above results, three formulations F 3, F 6, F 9 were selected for stability studies these formulations showed not much variation in any parameter even after the period of 30 days, formulations F 3, F 6, F 9 are found to be stable and retained their original properties.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, an {{attempt was made}} to prepare {{immediate-release}} enteric-coated pellets of aceclofenac, a poorly soluble nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that has a gastrointestinal intolerance as its serious side effect. Formulation of enteric-coated pellets with improved solubility of aceclofenac could address both of these problems. To achieve these goals, pellets were prepared by extrusion–spheronization method using pelletizing agents that can contribute to the faster disintegration and thereby improve the solubility of the drug. Different disintegrants like β-cyclodextrin, kollidon CL, Ac-Di-Sol, and <b>sodium</b> starch <b>glycolate</b> were tried in order to further improve disintegration time. The pellets were characterized for drug content, particle size distribution, flow properties, infrared spectroscopy, surface morphology, disintegration rate, and dissolution profile. The formulations, which showed best disintegration and dissolution profiles, were coated with Eudragit L 100 - 55, an enteric-coated polymer which does not dissolve at gastric pH but dissolves at intestinal pH, releasing the drug immediately in the dissolution medium. The optimized enteric-coated formulation containing 20 % κ-carrageenan, lactose, and <b>sodium</b> starch <b>glycolate</b> as a disintegrant did inhibit the release of the drug for 2  h in 0. 1  N HCl, whereas 87 % of the drug was released within 45  min. The improvement was substantial when it was compared with solubility of pure drug under the same conditions. Thus, dissolution profiles suggested that combination of κ-carrageenan and <b>sodium</b> starch <b>glycolate</b> resulted into fast-disintegrating, immediate-release pellets, overcoming the bioavailability problem of the poorly soluble drug, aceclofenac, and enteric coating of these pellets avoids the exposure of aceclofenac to ulcer-prone areas of the gastrointestinal tract...|$|R
