50|$|Finnish {{designer}} Eero Rislakki {{designed a}} plastic jerrycan in 1970 {{with a small}} <b>screwable</b> stopper on the top side behind the handle to allow air flowing in to ensure smooth fuel outflow. It is lighter than the original design yet almost as sturdy. It was quickly adopted by the Finnish armed forces, and is commercially available.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{unveiling}} of the QCW-05 submachine gun at the 2005 International Police Equipment Expo in Beijing, Jianshe Industries (Group) Corporation, a company under the China South Industries Group Corporation state-owned conglomerate presented an export variant of their latest submachine gun at the 2006 MILIPOL expo named the 'JS 9 mm'. The submachine gun was a bullpup, select-fire, open bolt, blowback operated submachine gun with a <b>screwable</b> suppressor {{that is capable of}} using many different 9×19mm cartridges. Internally the JS 9 mm is exactly the same as the QCW-05, which is a submachine gun designed for use by the People's Liberation Army Ground Force, People's Liberation Army Special Operations Forces and the People's Armed Police except for the different chambering. The JS 9 mm is designed for export to the international market, specifically at various police and law enforcement forces and not for domestic use either with military or any police force. Currently the JS 9 mm is exported world-wide by NORINCO Equipment, Ltd. through a marketing agreement with China South Industries Group.|$|E
40|$|Aim: Bendable and angulated single-piece {{implants}} {{are used}} alternatively to <b>screwable</b> abutments in two-piece dental implant designs. Though used frequently, {{data on the}} stress distribution within such implants are not available and the question whether the bending contributes to fracture resistance has not been addressed. Methods: We used the method of fi nite element to identify von Mises stresses and maximum stresses in bent and non-bent but angulated implants. Implants with one (e. g. applicable to screw designs) or two (applicable to basal implants) bending areas were the variables under investigation. Results: For bends up to 13 degrees we discovered {{that if there is}} only one bend, the maximum stress is in the bent area. If two bends are made in two diff erent bending areas, the maximum stresses are distributed between the two and, if either one of the bent areas is machined, there are no residual stresses within the implant body in this area. The maximum stresses are always located near the base-plates. The absolute value of the maximum stress is higher because no residual stresses are available to compensate stresses that stem from loading. Conclusion: Assuming that all other parameters are equal, bendable (basal) implants show a more even stress dis-tribution along the vertical implant region than identically shaped implants with a machine-angulated area. Bendable basal implants therefore probably resist masticatory forces better than pre-angulated, machined implants, and unben...|$|E
40|$|Introduction A widely {{distributed}} commercially available target station for the irradiation of solid targets is the COSTIS system. The system is specified for beams up to 500 W and {{is equipped with}} a front side He-cooling and water cooling on the back side. The target itself has a coin shape with a diameter of 24 mm and thickness of 2 mm. This recommends the system for irradiation of thin targets like foils but it is also useable for irradiation of metal and oxide powders. However the irradiation of powders and granulates is limited due to the dimension of the target capsule. A setup of a capped closed target is hardly achievable. The purpose of this work was the modification of the COSTIS target station for the use of thicker target capsules. This shall enable the more easy and safe handling and irradiation of powdery targets and the use of lockable target capsules. Material and Methods The adaption of the COSTIS system for wider targets is easy and fast achievable by the ex-change of the target guiding plate together with the four distance bolts and their bearings. The effort of the replacement of the standard with the modified parts is comparable with COSTIS maintenance including exchange of the window foil and the O-rings. For the target capsule itself different designs were developed and tested. Now various target capsules are available, depending on required energy, handling needs and properties of the target material. Different locking systems can be used, from “click” capsules to <b>screwable</b> systems. Additionally the tightness of the target capsule can be achieved by placement of on O-ring between the lid and capsule body. Results and Conclusion The wider target body allows the capping of the target material. This enables a wide range of applications. One aspect is the nanoparticle research, where radiolabelling is an excellent tool for in situ online investigations. The chosen design of the target capsule allowed the direct activation of TiO 2 nanoparticles. Via the nuclear reaction 48 Ti(p,n) 48 V radiolabelled [48 V]TiO 2 nanoparticles can be obtained. Another example is the use of recoil effects for radiolabelling of nanoparticles. In this case the kinetic energy of the product of the nuclear reaction 7 Li(p,n) 7 Be is used to implant a radioactive tracer in different nanomaterials like Ag 0 – nanoparticles and MWCNT (multi wall carbon nano tubes). In general the irradiation of powders and granulates benefits from the modified design that allows the more flexible adaption to experimental needs...|$|E
