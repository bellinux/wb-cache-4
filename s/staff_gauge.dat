5000|$|Flood {{stage is}} the water level, as read by a stream gauge or tide gauge, for {{a body of}} water at a {{particular}} location, measured from the level at which {{a body of water}} threatens lives, property, commerce, or travel. The term [...] "at flood stage" [...] is commonly used to describe the point at which this occurs. [...] "Gauge height" [...] (also referred to as [...] "stream stage", [...] "stage of the of water", or simply [...] "stage") is the level of the water surface above an established zero datum at a given location. The zero level can be arbitrary, but it is usually close {{to the bottom of the}} stream or river or at the average level of standing bodies of water. Stage was traditionally measured visually using a <b>staff</b> <b>gauge,</b> which is a fixed ruler marked in 1/100 and 1/10 foot intervals, however electronic sensors that transmit real-time information to the Internet are now used for many of these kind of measurements. The flood stage measurements are given as a height above or below the zero level. Levels below zero are reported as a negative value.|$|E

It is within the growth {{corridor}} of Lake Tana Basin, where an increasing number of water resource development projects (mainly hydropower and irrigation) take place. Monitoring stations for runoff and sediment have been installed under Wase-Tana Project along Gumara River using automatic water level recorders to produce data of finer resolution (10 minutes duration) and ordinary <b>staff</b> <b>gauges</b> (maximum of three readings a day). Depth integrated suspended sediment samples have also been collected. This study presents an assessment of variation of different time scale discharge measurements and adjustments (refinements) for the daily discharge data acquired through manual records of the <b>staff</b> <b>gauges.</b> Preliminary analysis of the discharge and sediment data collected was made. The hydrograph shows that the mean daily discharge values from the automatic recorders are greater than the daily values of the <b>staff</b> <b>gauges</b> for almost all of the times of record (nearly 50 % increment). A good correlation has been found between the two methods (the correlation coefficient, R 2 = 0. 79) and the difference is much appreciated during the rainy seasons.

The study material included daily flows from the multi-year period of 1963 - 1983 collected for 19 catchments, located in the upper Vistula basin. Regions, with the same flow, were determined with use nonhierarchical cluster analysis (K-means). Groups were characterized by low flow and selected physiographic and meteorological features of the catchments.

Increase in runoff production in an urbanized catchment is a function, among other factors of to increase in percentage paved area brought about by deforestation activities and poor environmental attitude of the people. This study examines the relationship between runoff discharge and basin characteristics in Ilorin. Data used were collected directly from the field over a period of one calendar year. Rainfall data were collected in each basin using a standard rainguage of 20 cm orifice while basin discharge was collected twice daily (8. 00 am and 6. 30 pm) using fabricated <b>staff</b> <b>gauge</b> graduated in centimeter. Basin morphometric attributes were computed from topographic map while landuse map was prepared from satellite imagery. Soil samples were collected and analysed for particle size distribution.

Despite the growing pressure on water resources, the hydrological budget of the grabens is inadequately understood to develop better management options. The study investigates the water balance of the Aba’ala graben (553 km 2) along the western margin of the Danakil depression. We established rain <b>gauges,</b> divers, and <b>staff</b> <b>gauges</b> to collect the required data. Climate, crop and soil data were also collected to compute actual evapotranspiration. Rating curves and hydrographs were developed to analyze the runoff components of the graben. The study shows that seasonal rainfall (521. 5 Mm 3) has an erratic behavior that led to 29. 2 Mm 3 runoff volume entering the Aba’ala bottom. The average rate of water flow was varied between the escarpment and graben outlet (P< 0. 00). Furthermore, the western escarpment contributes 13. 49 Mm 3 baseflow to the graben bottom. However, 25. 2 Mm 3 volume of flood runoff is lost through the outlet from the graben bottom. Besides, high actual evapotranspiration rates (312. 61 Mm 3) reduced moisture stress in the graben bottom. The deep percolation and storage share 38 % of the water inflow into graben bottom. We underscore that better management of runoff components enhances water storage to build livelihood resilience of the graben communities...|$|R

Loads of elements for the particular sections were calculated {{as a product of}} concentration and water flow rate. Daily flow rate (Q) values of the analysed sections, necessary for the calculation of loads from the three main affluents (about 90  % of total supply) and run-offs from the reservoirs were obtained from Solina–Myczkowce Power Plant S.A (continuous stage measurements. Q value for smaller watercourses was calculated on the day of water sampling, using installed <b>staff</b> <b>gauge</b> readings. Concentrations between the sampling days were calculated using the statistical approach, according to Mukhopadhyay and Smith (2000). Uncertainty of calculated loads was approximated on the base of Harmel et al. (2006) as cumulative uncertainties of potential sources of error. We assumed errors during sampling (uncertainty of 15  %), chemical procedures and analyses (above mentioned CVP, ca. 2  %) and flows measurement (continuous stage measurements, uncertainty of 2  %). Therefore, C, N, P and Si loads are calculation with errors of ± 19  %. To estimate the cumulative probable uncertainty of calculated retentions the root mean square error propagation method were used (Harmel et al. 2006). However, the analysis and discussion of data are based on the most probabilistic, average values due to clarity of the paper and per analogiam to many other authors (e.g. Mengis et al. 1997; Garnier et al. 1999; Torres et al. 2007; Hejzlar et al. 2009).|$|E
40|$|Stage-fall-discharge (SFD) rating curves are {{traditionally}} used to compute streamflow records at sites where the energy {{slope of the}} flow is variable due to variable backwater effects. We introduce a model with hydraulically interpretable parameters for estimating SFD rating curves and their uncertainties. Conventional power functions for channel and section controls are used. The transition to a backwater-affected channel control is computed based on a continuity condition, solved either analytically or numerically. The practical use of the method is demonstrated with two real twin-gauge stations, the Rhone River at Valence, France, and the Guthusbekken stream at station 00030033, Norway. Those stations are typical of a channel control and a section control, respectively, when backwater-unaffected conditions apply. The performance of the method is investigated through sensitivity analysis to prior information on controls and to observations (i. e., available gaugings) for the station of Valence. These analyses suggest that precisely identifying SFD rating curves requires adapted gauging strategy and/or informative priors. The Madeira River, {{one of the largest}} tributaries of the Amazon, provides a challenging case typical of large, flat, tropical river networks where bed roughness can also be variable in addition to slope. In this case, the difference in <b>staff</b> <b>gauge</b> reference levels must be estimated as another uncertain parameter of the SFD model. The proposed Bayesian method is a valuable alternative solution to the graphical and empirical techniques still proposed in hydrometry guidance and standards...|$|E

These test catchments, whose size ranges between 2. 3 and 110 ha, are located above the timberline at elevations between 1, 784 and 2, 380 m. Their land surfaces consist of lakes, rock formations, debris deposits, and alpine meadows. Hydrological data were collected for the water year 2001. The catchments were instrumented by three automatic weather stations recording global and net solar radiation, air temperature, humidity, precipitation, and soil temperature. Lake water levels were registered with <b>staff</b> <b>gauges</b> and runoff evaluated from water storage calculations. Runoff genesis was investigated by means of chemical tracers (Rhodamine WT and Lithium chloride). Hydrological process estimations were made using standard methods including: the input of precipitation and snowmelt, both potential and actual evaporation, which was estimated by the approaches of HAMON, PRIESTLEY-TAYLOR, PENMAN and GRINDLEY, and runoff calculated from the lake storage, were compared with results of the conceptual hydrological BROOK 90 model. The empirical results show that hydrological processes are governed by the temperature-dependent regime of high mountain snowmelt. However, the major differences in water yield and runoff genesis between watersheds were {{due to differences in}} the morphologies of the lakes and their basins, the soil...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Accurate {{measurement}} of the hydroperiod in isolated wetlands currently relies upon the installation and frequent monitoring of devices such as piezometers and <b>staff</b> <b>gauges.</b> Observations of biological indicators of the hydroperiod {{may be able to}} supplement data collected from these devices and could potentially replace them as a means of accurately determining this hydrologic interval. The study objective was to determine whether adventitious root formation and maturation on buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis) {{could be used as a}} viable indicator of the hydroperiod in isolated wetlands. Buttonbush seedlings were flooded in a controlled environment over a three month period in the summer of 2011. During this time, the length and complexity of adventitious roots observed were recorded. When average lengths of primary roots were regressed against time of inundation, a linear regression (r 2) of 0. 94 was calculated. The structure of these roots was then compared to adventitious roots observed in a natural wetland with a hydroperiod of 12 months. This was undertaken to allow a comparison of the observed lengths and complexity of adventitious roots in the controlled experiment with roots in the natural environment. The regression of both sets of observations yielded an r 2 value of 0. 99. Consequently, the results of this study found that the length of adventitious roots on buttonbush can help determine the hydroperiods of isolated wetland systems...|$|R
40|$|Closed basins {{are major}} {{development}} corridors in the semi-arid mountain catchments of Ethiopia. But despite the growing natural and anthropogenic pressures on water resources, {{there is still}} inadequate knowledge on hydrological behaviour of marginal grabens to develop sustainable management strategies. The objective {{of this study is}} to quantify the components of water balance in the Aba’ala graben. Therefore, rain gauges, pressure transducers, and <b>staff</b> <b>gauges</b> were installed at representative rivers. Monthly based transect studies across the runoff production areas were undertaken to understand the runoff mechanisms. We developed rating curves and hydrographs for each gauging station to analyse the discharges, we estimated actual evapotranspiration and we used the model parameters of gauged catchments to estimate the runoff inflow from ungauged catchments. This study shows that rainfall has an erratic behavior in the marginal graben, which led to enormous runoff volumes. The largest share of the discharges was generated from western escarpments and took place in the form of flash floods, mainly between July and August. Hydrograph analysis reveals that there were a series of quickflows and baseflows in the rainy season. Travertine dams situated in the upper catchment of Murga and Aba’ala Rivers were the production area of many springs that recharged the flat productive area. However, there is a massive risk of water loss through deep percolation and evapotranspiration. Much of the flash floods and regular floods left the marginal graben bottom via its single outlet. These flash floods could be potentially intercepted by selective tree species, terraces and check dams to improve blue and green water storages in the Aba’ala marginal graben. A better understanding of the hydrological behaviour of the marginal graben is proven valuable towards a sustainable land management in the closed basins...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Streamflow {{data are}} {{essential}} for water resources planning and decision making and are routinely analyzed to determine the impacts of climate change on hydrology. Unfortunately, current stream gauges, largely {{the responsibility of the}} U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) in the U. S. and similar agencies worldwide, are expensive to install and operate and are being steadily decommissioned. Part of the solution to this problem is a low-cost stream gauging system that is simple enough to use by people with little or no formal training in environmental monitoring. In this article, a low-cost, digital camera-based stream stage monitoring system is proposed, described, and tested. As a proof-of-concept, a time series was generated by taking digital pictures of a <b>staff</b> <b>gauge</b> at 3 h intervals over several weeks at a current USGS gauging site. The image-based stage heights closely matched the USGS gauge values, although significant stage height errors were evi-dent in a small percentage (< 3 %) of the images. We identified the problem as being caused by shadows and irregular lighting and proposed a protocol for eliminating these errant images. When the obviously problematic images were re-moved, the relative differences between the image-based stages and USGS stages were approximately 5 %. The next step is to develop an on-line system for post-processing the images so that watershed networks, citizen science organizations, K- 12 educational institutions, and others can engage in stream monitoring and make their data freely available. We also propose some possible next steps for determining stream cross-section and flow velocity using this low-cost camera- or image-based monitoring system...|$|E
40|$|Citizen {{science can}} provide {{spatially}} distributed data over large areas, including hydrological data. Stream levels {{are easier to}} measure than streamflow and are likely also observed more easily by citizen scientists than streamflow. However, the challenge with crowd based stream level data is that observations are taken at irregular time intervals and with a limited vertical resolution. The latter is especially the case at sites where no <b>staff</b> <b>gauge</b> is available and relative stream levels are observed based on (in) visible features in the stream, such as rocks. In order to assess the potential value of crowd based stream level observations for model calibration, we pretended that stream level observations were available at a limited vertical resolution by transferring streamflow data to stream level classes. A bucket-type hydrological model was calibrated with these hypothetical stream level class data and subsequently evaluated on the observed streamflow records. Our results indicate that stream level data can result in good streamflow simulations, even with a reduced vertical resolution of the observations. Time series of only two stream level classes, e. g. above or below a rock in the stream, were already informative, especially when the class boundary was chosen towards the highest stream levels. There was some added value in using up to five stream level classes, but there was hardly any improvement in model performance when using more level classes. These results are encouraging for citizen science projects and {{provide a basis for}} designing observation systems that collect data that are as informative as possible for deriving model based streamflow time series for previously ungauged basins...|$|E

The project selected 70 sites with flow measurement devices throughout the state. During the assessment each device had its physical condition and flow measurement accuracy documented. Although a wide variety of flow measurement devices were tested, the majority were Parshall flumes. Many of the assessed Parshall flumes were not measuring flow to the specified ± 5 percent design accuracy. Problems in flow measurement were due to issues with the <b>staff</b> <b>gauge</b> location and incorrect entrance geometry. Laboratory tests were conducted at the Utah Water Research Laboratory in an attempt to provide accurate flow measurement from flumes with these issues. The tests simulated incorrect locations for measuring upstream head with different entrance geometries on a 2 -ft-wide Parshall flume. The flume was tested with three different entrance wingwall configurations, eighteen stilling wells, and two point gauges, allowing water surface profiles to be collected throughout the flume. Corrections for incorrect head measurement locations and entrance geometries were created. The objective of this thesis is to provide water users and regulators with the information necessary to help improve open-channel flow measurement accuracies. An overview of design accuracies and flow measurement devices is given. In addition, a method to correct for incorrect head readings in Parshall flumes, a widely used flow measurement device in Utah, is presented. It is expected that this information will help water users and regulators monitor their water with the understanding necessary to ensure that water is more accurately measured...|$|E

This paper reports on the adoption of three different approaches (real and virtual) to simulate the working world of professional journalists: a web‐based, scenario‐centred simulation, a collaborative online tool (wiki), and actual audiences. The paper further reports on the assessment approaches adopted and the opportunities and the challenges in assessing the real‐world practice of journalism in both real and simulated environments. The role of peer review as a journalistic and assessment practice is examined, with a particular focus on the diversity of the quality of the feedback. The formative and summative evaluation approaches used by <b>staff</b> to <b>gauge</b> student perceptions about the learning and teaching ar outlined. Whilst the use of innovative approaches of simulated environments is often clear to academic staff, students can have different perceptions and not engage with the simulation, but rather reject it as a viable learning experience. One of the implications for journalism education is the increased workload for staff and the real‐world expectations for students about teaching and learning...|$|R
40|$|Research {{suggests}} that Students’ Unions (SU) role {{has changed over}} the years. Historically, SUs were viewed as political and debating organisations and then moving far more towards extracurricular and commercial areas. This attracted negative press and has resulted in the work of SUs not always being portrayed as positive or professional. Research suggests there has recently been a shift by SUs to re-establish their core role of representation. This is due to a number of factors including, National Students Survey (NSS) and National Union of Students (NUS) /Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) initiatives encouraging far more emphasis on student experience whilst working in partnership with their Universities to ensure the student voice is heard through their SUs. This research has undertaken a qualitative approach, using semi structured interviews with 8 University of Chester staff (UoC) <b>staff</b> to <b>gauge</b> university <b>staff</b> perceptions of the role of Chester Students’ Union (CSU) and how this contributes to student experience. Findings from these interviews suggested staff were aware of the role of a SU and the core role of representation. However when questioned about the existing working partnership with CSU their knowledge was fragmented and relied on professional/personal experiences rather than overall awareness. Commercial and social aspects of the role of CSU were far more apparent. The role of representation was noted as being ineffective. If SUs are only being observed by their universities for their social activities rather than a professional partner within student experience this could have negative results for funding and functions of SUs in future. Recommendations have been made to address issues of effective engagement of students, representation and partnership working with the university. This will be addressed with an implementation plan presented at strategic planning meetings...|$|R
40|$|The high {{sensibility}} and {{the short}} lag time response of glaciers to climate change make them relevant climatic indicators in the Tropics. Climatic signals lead to variation of the glacier mass balance calculated by {{the difference between the}} accumulation terms (precipitation) and the ablation terms (melting and sublimation). The discharge of the pro-glacial stream integrates most of the reaction of the glacier in response to climate variability. Here we present the main results of a research program developed since 1991 in the Andes. This paper is based on the data obtained on Zongo Glacier, Cordillera Real of Bolivia (16 °S, 68 °W). The 2. 1 km 2 glacier is part of a 3 km 2 basin above the main hydrometric station. The hydrological regime is analysed at different time scales and compared to the mass balance measurements and to the energetical fluxes close to the Equilibrium Line Altitude. The accumulation season, between October and March, coincides with the period of higher ablation. During this humid season, melt rates at the glacier surface lead to high discharges of the stream escaping from the glacier snout. Net all-wave radiation is the main source of energy at the glacier surface and shows strong fluctuations in relation to the highly variable albedo. An important peculiarity of tropical glaciers is the negative latent heat flux indicating strong sublimation, particularly during the dry season. The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events have a great influence on tropical glaciers, as shown during the last 1997 - 98 ENSO event. The main factor responsible for the dramatic melting of the glacier during the last ENSO warm event is the deficit of precipitation which reduces the accumulation and causes a low albedo on {{a large part of the}} glacier. Since 1973, monthly discharges from Zongo Glacier have been calculated, on the base of two daily readings at a <b>staff</b> <b>gauge</b> downstream the main hydrometric station [...] .

40|$|In many {{catchments}} of {{the southwestern}} Ethiopian highlands sediment production and delivery to rivers or dams is poorly understood. Because the catchments have heterogeneous lithology and climatic conditions across short distances, sediment production and transport in small catchment that drain {{to the river}} or dams is highly variable. In addition, sediment production processes are influenced by land use and land management. Information is lacking on which parts of such catchments and which erosion processes produce most sediment, information that is crucial to design efficient mitigation measures. This {{study was conducted to}} better understand spatial and temporal sediment production and sediment transport towards the Gilgel Gibe reservoir. This was achieved by monitoring suspended sediment concentration of the rivers in the Gilgel Gibe catchment over a 12 month period. A total of five monitoring stations were established: three on the rivers entering the reservoir (Gilgel Gibe main river and 2 tributaries: Nada Guda and Nadie) and two on the tributaries Unta and Bulbul of Gilgel Gibe main river. From September 2009 to August 2010, at each monitoring station the river stage was read every 12 hr (i. e at 6 : 00 AM and 6 : 00 PM) from a <b>staff</b> <b>gauge.</b> A suspended sediment sample was taken every day in a depth-integrated way, and sediment concentration was determined by weighing the sediment after evaporating the water in a drying oven at 105 °C. To establish the depth-discharge rating curve for each station, at least 12 manual stream velocity measurements were made with a current meter covering the entire range from lowest to highest river. Continuous suspended sediment load was calculated from daily measured suspended sediment concentration and discharge estimated from depth-discharge rating curve. Delineation of the sub-watershed was done using topographic maps and 30 -m ASTER DEM with ArcGIS 9. 3 software. The mean suspended sediment concentration varies from 0. 44 gL- 1 in Gilgel Gibe main river to 2. 03 gL- 1 in Unta river. The highest annual sediment yield (49. 3 ton ha- 1 yr - 1) was also observed at Unta stations whereas the lowest (0. 4 ton ha- 1 yr- 1 at) was at Gilgel Gibe station. This highest sediment yield was measured at a small subcatchment (Unta) situated in a higher elevation within the catchment. Two percent of Unta subcatchment was found to be seriously affected by landslides, many of them transporting sediment directly into Unta river. The higher average slope of the subcatchment slope implying less opportunity for sediment deposition may also explain the high sediment yield. Regression analysis of suspended sediment yield SSY (ton km- 2 year- 1) on drainage area A (km 2) yielded a negative relationship (SSY = 2709433 A- 1. 32, R 2 = 0. 87, n= 5) for areas between 84 and 2738 km 2. We moreover observed a clear temporal variation in suspended sediment yield during the rainy season. The suspended sediment yield is higher towards the end of summer (August) than in the middle of summer (July) during the highest amount of rainfall. Hence, the susceptibility of the soil to land slide is high when the soil is saturated {{at the end of the}} summer season, the overall sediment yield of the catchment was high during this period. Besides, the higher sediment yield in the middle of summer (July) than the beginning is due to highest amount of rainfall and an increase of sediment production. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{development}} of a study area for the Hanoi University of Natural Resources and Environment (HUNRE). This university has chosen the Day river basin (next to Hanoi) to use as a study area for Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) education. This thesis will focus on two courses of the bachelor program of HUNRE: Water Resources Monitoring (WRM and Water Resources Systems Modelling (WRSM). The first objective of this thesis is to explore the study area. The data and information which will be collected during fieldwork, a literature study and analysing the available data will be collected in a database. This data will be the input data for the models of the course WRSM. The second objective is to develop a practical site for the course WRM. At this practical site students will measure the cross section (water depths) and flow velocity. With the flow measurements the students can calculate the discharge. With the information/data from the first objective {{it will be possible to}} select a measurement location, measurement methods and equipment. After some trial measurements a guideline will be written, so the students can follow this guideline during the practical. The study area exists of two tributaries of the Red River; the Tich River and the Day river. The characteristics of these rivers are different. The Tich River is a natural river, with its origin in the Ba Vi mountain range. The Day river is now a ‘’dead’’ river. This is caused by the two control structures (Day dam and the Van Coc sluice) upstream. This results in a flow velocity of nearly zero. This is also the reason why the Day river is much more polluted than the Tich River. At the moment the government is constructing a new channel from Cam Dinh to the Day River which will supply fresh water to the Day River. After some fieldtrips a measurement location at the Tich River is chosen which met all requirements to function as practical site for students. At this location an irrigation company has built a stair from the dike until the water surface. With this stair the river is easily accessible and this stair can be used as a reference for reading the water level. The next step was to select measuring methods for this location and select equipment to for these methods. A <b>staff</b> <b>gauge</b> is chosen to measure the water depth. The velocity area method is chosen to measure the discharge at the measurement location. The flow velocity which is needed for this method is measured by a propeller current meter. The last phase of the fieldwork existed of trial measurements at the measurement location. At the moment of the trial measurements it was dry season, this means a low water depth and a low discharge. After the trial measurement a guideline for the course Water Resources Monitoring is written. This guideline contains background information about the study area, explanation why this location is chose to measure, an description of the methods and equipment, a step for step guideline to measure the water depth and flow velocity and some questions about the practical and theory behind the measurements. The final recommendations for the total study area are: 9 ̆ 5 Monitor the influence of the new Cam Dinh channel. This channel can alter the characteristics of the study area drastically. 9 ̆ 5 Keep the database up to date The final recommendations for the measurement location are: 9 ̆ 5 Collect more information about the measurement location from the Day irrigation company, they have precise information about the location of the reference level 9 ̆ 5 In the future it is useful to develop a second measurement location. 9 ̆ 5 The practical site can be used for more measurements of other courses, for example water quality measurements or meteorological measurements. 9 ̆ 5 Monitor the water level with a continuous water level recording device like a diver The final recommendation for the course WRM and WRSM are: 9 ̆ 5 Collect missing input data for the models of WRSM 9 ̆ 5 Improve the guideline after the first students are finished with the practicalWater Recources ManagementWater ManagementCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a conceptual rainfall-runoff model generally requires calibration to obtain non-observable parameters. This becomes especially difficult in river basins where data are absent, frequently intermittent or inaccurate. Rainfall-runoff models are usually calibrated on discharge data that are derived from stage observations {{by means of a}} rating curve. However, this method is error-prone, as it is not able to get around problems such as a changing geometry of the river channel, flows over floodplain and a variable roughness coefficient due to vegetation. Moreover, uncertain stage observations can be a severe source of error as well, because of incorrect placement of the <b>staff</b> <b>gauges</b> or incorrect and infrequent stage readings. Calibration on uncertain discharge data can affect modeled parameters and consequently be cause for erroneous model predictions. This works uses water levels of reservoirs to calibrate a conceptual rainfall-runoff model in the Umbeluzi River Basin. The conceptual model provides the inflow to the reservoir, subsequently reservoir storage is modeled and compared to the observed storage. The proposed method has several advantages over the conventional method. First of all, stage observations are accurately observed because of the social and economic importance of the reservoir. Moreover, the method is well suited to observe floods, as the shape of the reservoir is well confined and its capacity generally more than adequate. It also captures the entire volume of a flood, in contrary to the conventional method where effects of hysteresis can be cause for misconception of the river discharge. An additional advantage is that reservoirs can integrate multiple tributaries, allowing to model tributaries that are not or scarcely gauged. Lastly, this method may have some economic benefits as the water levels and the surface area of the reservoir can in principal be derived by radar altimetry through satellites. This allows for the system to be remotely calibrated. By incorporating irrigation into the hydrological model, the effects of artificial reservoirs on the basin hydrology are assessed. The conceptual model is calibrated with inclusion and exclusion of irrigation and subsequently best parameter sets are compared. Results show that the excess irrigation water that percolates to the ground water has a significant influence on the resulting base flow, such that model parameters have to be compensated when irrigation is excluded. Moreover, a changing crop need due to the varying lengths of dry spells, is cause for variability in irrigation over the years. This makes modeling base flow challenging. It appears that inclusion of irrigation into the hydrological model {{is the only way to}} obtain a consistent ground water parameter. This thesis shows a validation approach whereby multiple system components are validated on various independent data-sources. The modeled evaporation is compared to evaporation that is developed with use of satellite data. Both time-series correspond well, which implies that the lumped modeled water storage of the catchment is plausible. In addition, it implicitly validates the amount of transpiration from irrigation, which is included in the actual evaporation. To validate on smaller system components, the water levels of the conceptualized floodplain storage are compared to observed river stage. Although absolute values are not comparable, the emptying and filling of the flood plains harmonizes with the rate of change of observed stage levels. Lastly, the model is tested on a tributary of the catchment, generating reasonable model prediction, despite the poor data quality. The author argues that this way of validation is more valuable than validating on time-series outside the calibration period, as it takes multiple aspects of the system into account. For this study both a lumped and a topography driven model is tested. During the calibration, both models give a similar model performance. However the optimum parameter set of the topography driven mode was better applicable in other catchments. Moreover, the parameters derived where also more realistic. It is therefore that the topography driven model works better for the Umbeluzi catchment. HydrologyWater ManagementCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|How does {{knowledge}} management (KM) {{by a government}} agency responsible for environmental impact assessment (EIA) potentially contribute to better environmental assessment and management practice? Staff members at government agencies {{in charge of the}} EIA process are knowledge workers who perform judgement-oriented tasks highly reliant on individual expertise, but also grounded on the agency`s knowledge accumulated over the years. Part of an agency`s knowledge can be codified and stored in an organizational memory, but is subject to decay or loss if not properly managed. The EIA agency operating in Western Australia was used as a case study. Its KM initiatives were reviewed, knowledge repositories were identified and <b>staff</b> surveyed to <b>gauge</b> the utilisation and effectiveness of such repositories in enabling them to perform EIA tasks. Key elements of KM are the preparation of substantive guidance and spatial information management. It was found that treatment of cumulative impacts on the environment is very limited and information derived from project follow-up is not properly captured and stored, thus not used to create new knowledge and to improve practice and effectiveness. Other opportunities for improving organizational learning include the use of after-action reviews. The learning about {{knowledge management}} in EIA practice gained from Western Australian experience should be of value to agencies worldwide seeking to understand where best to direct their resources for their own knowledge repositories and environmental management practice.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to explore the structure and rationale of nurture groups currently running in secondary schools. Research in this area is limited and little is currently known about how these groups run. Thus this exploratory research examines the potentially highly varied approaches to nurture in Key Stage 3 in six schools across a large shire county in the south-east of England. A sequential mixed methods design was used to gather quantitative data about the structure of these groups and in-depth semi-structured interviews were carried out to <b>gauge</b> <b>staff</b> perception of the rationale behind them. The findings indicate that all participating schools have developed their own NG model in response to the needs of their most vulnerable pupils and the needs of the school organisation leading to great variation in the NG approach. Despite differences between the approaches, some aspects of the structure and rationale of secondary school NGs were consistently raised by participants as important considerations. The more complex organisational structures and needs of adolescent pupils require a more flexible and age-appropriate approach to nurture at KS 3 and beyond. Further development of an appropriate model is required with a particular focus on developing communication systems, selection and assessment processes to monitor impact and embedding the nurture approach within the wider school context. This research has some potentially important implications for Educational Psychologists (EPs) with regard to supporting school transition work, delivery of training and implementation of appropriate intervention for pupils with Social, Emotional and Behavioural Difficulties (SEBD) in mainstream settings...|$|R
