25|$|If {{the voltage}} across the {{photoresistor}} does {{not exceed the}} threshold, which varies between 100 and 300 mV depending on the material, then the coefficient of nonlinear distortions has a value within 0.01%, which is almost independent of the voltage. These distortions are dominated by the second harmonic. Above the voltage threshold, the third harmonic appears, and the amplitude of the distortions increases as {{the square of the}} voltage. For a distortion of 0.1% (−80dB), which is acceptable for high-fidelity sound equipment, the <b>signal</b> <b>voltage</b> should be within 500 mV. The ratio of even and odd harmonics can be controlled by applying a DC bias to the photoresistor.|$|E
2500|$|Another way to {{classify}} amplifiers {{is by the}} phase relationship of the input signal to the output signal. [...] An 'inverting' amplifier produces an output 180 degrees out of phase with the input signal (that is, a polarity inversion or {{mirror image of the}} input as seen on an oscilloscope). A 'non-inverting' amplifier maintains the phase of the input signal waveforms. An emitter follower is a type of non-inverting amplifier, indicating that the signal at the emitter of a transistor is following (that is, matching with unity gain but perhaps an offset) the input <b>signal.</b> <b>Voltage</b> follower is also non inverting type of amplifier having unity gain.|$|E
2500|$|All {{semiconductor}} detectors function rather inefficiently {{in crystal}} receivers, because the low voltage input to the detector {{is too low}} to result in much difference between forward better conduction direction, and the reverse weaker conduction. [...] To improve the sensitivity {{of some of the}} early crystal detectors, such as silicon carbide, a small forward bias voltage was applied across the detector by a battery and potentiometer. [...] The bias moves the diode's operating point higher on the detection curve producing more <b>signal</b> <b>voltage</b> at the expense of less signal current (higher impedance). There is a limit to the benefit that this produces, depending on the other impedances of the radio. [...] This improved sensitivity was caused by moving the DC operating point to a more desirable voltage-current operating point (impedance) on the junction's I-V curve. The battery did not power the radio, but only provided the biasing voltage which required little power.|$|E
