The authors find that in most cases the milk reactions correspond to the sero-agglutination results, and that it is the agglutination of the <b>stained</b> <b>antigen</b> which is the principal sign of a positive reaction rather than ring formation, which is very irregular. Haematoxylin antigen is generally more reliable than Bendtsen antigen, but, with either, the results should be read after 1 - 2 hours' incubation at 37 °C.

The cultural method to identify avian Salmonella infections is laborious and expensive, thus a rapid, sensitive and cost-effective method for the diagnosis of salmonellosis is anticipated. In the present investigation Salmonella pullorum organisms {{was obtained from the}} Department of Pathology and it was characterized by culture, biochemical tests and PCR. A neotetrazolium <b>stained</b> Salmonella pullorum <b>antigen</b> was prepared from local isolate of Salmonella pullorum. The protein concentration of <b>stained</b> <b>antigen</b> was measured by BSA standard curve. Prepared antigen was diluted in 2 fold dilution and minimum 72. 5 μg/μl antigen concentration showed the positive reaction. Different preservatives (0. 5 % phenolized saline, 0. 5 % formalized saline and 0. 09 % sodium azide) were used to maintain the shelf life of prepared antigen. All the preservatives showed the similar results up to six months. Slide agglutination tests were carried out with un-diluted and diluted anti-sera having known ELISA titre and end point agglutination titre was determined. Serum titre 13942 - 21362 gave positive result to 2 - 5 fold dilution of serum and serum titre 412 - 771 showed negative result. Different groups of antigens were developed while antigen group- 1 (48 h bacterial culture treated with 24 h in neotetrazolium and 2 h in thiomersal) gave the striking positive result. As Group- 1 antigen exhibited highest protein concentration (1240 μg/μl) and gave the best result with positive sera, so it was selected for field trial. The seroprevalence of Salmonella infection was 44. 39 % in a particular poultry farm. The <b>stained</b> <b>antigen</b> was then stored at 4 o C. As all used preservatives revealed similar trend of results, so it may be recommend that 0. 5 % phenolized saline as preservative because it is cost effective. In the present study, the slide agglutination test was found easy, sensitive, reliable, cost and time effective and needed very small amount of antigen, sera and as well as accessories.

The use of filter paper by Castaneda (1950) to demonstrate the presence of a Brucella antigen-antibody system introduced a technique in which paper and not a serological test tube constituted the milieu in which the reaction took place. The technique featured the use of a <b>stained</b> Brucella <b>antigen</b> placed on the surface of filter paper which was observed to resist the washing effect of a stream of isotonic saline in the presence of Brucella immune serum. The phenomenon which took place in less than one minute was called "surface fixation " and was not observed to occur in the presence of normal or heterologous immune serum.

An immunogold-silver {{immunohistochemical}} {{technique was}} used to determine the chronological distribution and localization of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in experimentally infected gnotobiotic pigs. Thirty-two pigs were randomly allocated to infected (n = 24) or control (n = 8) groups. Pigs in infected groups were inoculated at 3 days of age by nasal instillation of PRRSV isolate ATCC VR- 2332 (total dose = 102. 64 TCID,,), and control pigs were exposed in the same manner to uninfected cell culture supernatant. Three infected and one control pigs were euthanatized at 12 hours and at 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21 days postexposure (DPE).
