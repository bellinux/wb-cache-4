25|$|While the {{measures}} of the internal angles in planar triangles always sum to 180°, a hyperbolic triangle has measures of angles that sum to less than 180°, and a <b>spherical</b> <b>triangle</b> has measures of angles that sum to more than 180°. A hyperbolic triangle {{can be obtained by}} drawing on a negatively curved surface, such as a saddle surface, and a <b>spherical</b> <b>triangle</b> can be obtained by drawing on a positively curved surface such as a sphere. Thus, if one draws a giant triangle {{on the surface of the}} Earth, one will find that the sum of {{the measures}} of its angles is greater than 180°; in fact it will be between 180° and 540°. In particular it is possible to draw a triangle on a sphere such that the measure of each of its internal angles is equal to 90°, adding up to a total of 270°.|$|E

25|$|Many theorems from {{classical}} geometry {{hold true}} for spherical geometry as well, {{but not all}} do because the sphere fails to satisfy some of classical geometry's postulates, including the parallel postulate. In spherical trigonometry, angles are defined between great circles. Spherical trigonometry differs from ordinary trigonometry in many respects. For example, {{the sum of the}} interior angles of a <b>spherical</b> <b>triangle</b> always exceeds 180degrees. Also, any two similar spherical triangles are congruent.|$|E
500|$|In Gothic architecture, {{beginning}} in the late 13th century or early 14th century, the Reuleaux triangle became one of several curvilinear forms frequently used for windows, window tracery, and other architectural decorations. For instance, in English Gothic architecture, this shape was associated with the decorated period, both in its geometric style of 1250–1290 and continuing into its curvilinear style of 1290–1350. In this context, the shape is more frequently called a <b>spherical</b> <b>triangle,</b> but the more usual mathematical meaning of a <b>spherical</b> <b>triangle</b> is a triangle on the surface of a sphere (a shape also commonly used in architecture as a pendentive). In its use in Gothic church architecture, the three-cornered shape of the Reuleaux triangle may be seen both {{as a symbol of the}} Trinity, and as [...] "an act of opposition to the form of the circle".|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{question}} of how many regular unit tetrahedra with a vertex at the origin can be packed into the unit sphere is a well-known and difficult problem. The answer is between 20 and 22, and these results are reproduced-here. The classical method for calculating such bounds involves projecting the tetrahedra {{onto the surface of}} the sphere, yielding equilateral <b>spherical</b> <b>triangles.</b> Motivated by this, we search for upper and lower bounds on how many equilateral <b>spherical</b> <b>triangles</b> may be arranged on the unit sphere {{as a function of the}} spherical angle α between two sides.
