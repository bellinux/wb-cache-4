5|$|In March 2015 {{work began}} on a £12m upgrade to the flood defence scheme {{to upgrade the}} {{protection}} {{to cope with a}} 100-year flood. The scheme, which was due to be completed in December 2015, involves creating a flood <b>storage</b> <b>basin</b> {{to the north of the}} Castle Irwell student village. An area of 29 hectares will be excavated and the material will be used to construct a 3 metre high embankment around the site.|$|E

40|$|Nine primar,y lagoons and solids <b>storage</b> <b>basins</b> were sampled on Kansas dairies using flush systems. These {{samples were}} {{analyzed}} for nutrient content of wastewater and sand manure. The manure moisture {{content in the}} <b>storage</b> <b>basins</b> averaged 81 %. The average totals of nitrogen, phosphate, and potash were 3450, 1345, and 1420 mg/L, respectively, for flushing systems. The average totals of nitrogen, phosphate, and potash in the lagoon samples were 816, 337, and 1134 mg/L, respectively, for dairies using recycled water for flushing alleys. These data and previously reported data indicate that lagoon effluent and manure removed from basins must be managed differently between dairies using flush versus scrape systems...|$|R

With proper de-sign and management the anaer-obic lagoon can function for years. Odor from a well-designed and well-managed la-goon will be only slightly musty; foul odor indicates a malfunction requiring corrective action. Advantages of anaerobic la-goon systems are: • Manure can be handled with water flushing systems, sewer lines, pumps, and irriga-tion equipment. • The high degree of stabi-lization reduces odors during land application...|$|R

40|$|Dairy waste lagoons are earthen {{structures}} {{designed for}} biological treatment and long-term storage of dairy waste. L'flgoons are specially construct-ed to prevent leakage of dairy waste to ground water.

The natural biological action on the waste results in less odor during land application. Nitrogen con-tent of the waste is reduced in lagoons {{by as much as}} 80 per-cent.
