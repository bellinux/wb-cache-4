40|$|The {{sustainability}} of any Data Warehouse System (DWS) is closely correlated with user satisfaction. Therefore, analysts, designers and developers {{focused more on}} achieving all its functionality, without considering others kinds of requirement such as dependability <b>s</b> <b>aspects.</b> Moreover, these latter are often considered as properties {{of the system that}} will must be checked and corrected once the project is completed. The practice of "fix it later" can cause the obsolescence of the entire Data Warehouse System. Therefore, it requires the adoption of a methodology that will ensure the integration of aspects of dependability since the early stages of project DWS. In this paper, we first define the concepts related to dependability of DWS. Then we present our approach inspired from the MDA (Model Driven Architecture) approach to model dependability <b>s</b> <b>aspects</b> namely: availability, reliability, maintainability and security, taking into account their interaction.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} a scenario where a service provider {{has created a}} <b>software</b> service <b>S</b> and desires to outsource the execution of this service to an untrusted cloud. The software service contains secrets that the provider would like to keep hidden from the cloud. For example, the software might contain a secret database, and the service could allow users to make queries to different slices of this database depending on the user’s identity. This setting presents significant challenges not present in previous works on outsourcing or secure computation. Because secrets in the soft-ware itself must be protected against an adversary that has full control over the cloud that is executing this software, our notion implies indis-tinguishability obfuscation. Furthermore, we seek to protect knowledge of the <b>software</b> <b>S</b> to the maximum extent possible even if the cloud can collude with several corrupted users. In this work, we provide the first formalizations of security for this set...|$|R

DNA sequences for 3 -, 4 -, 5 -, and 6 -helix ribbon systems, and 4 -, 5 -, and 6 -helix tube systems were designed and optimized using the SEQUIN <b>software</b> (<b>S</b> 1) and the TileSoft <b>software</b> (<b>S</b> 2) to minimize sequence symmetry (S 1). The other systems were designed using an unpublished sequence design {{component of the}} NUPACK server (www. nupack. org) to maximize the affinity and specificity for the target structures (S 3). Sometimes, manual optimization was further performed on selected regions. Sample preparation. DNA strands were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technology, Inc. (www. idtdna. com) and purified by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or HPLC. The concentrations of the DNA strands were determined by the measurement of ultraviolet absorption at 260 nm. To assemble the structures, DNA strands were mixed stoichiometrically to a final concentration of ∼ 1 μM for 20 -helix ribbons and 20 -helix tubes and ∼ 3 μM for other structures in 1 × TAE/Mg ++ buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7. 6, 2 mM EDTA, 12. 5 mM MgCl 2) and annealed in a water bath in a styrofoam box by cooling from 90 ◦ Cto 23 ◦ C {{over a period of}} 24 to 72 hours.
