5|$|NY36 was {{assigned}} in the mid-1920s to an alignment extending from Hornell {{in the south}} to Avon in the north. The route utilized the routing of legislative Route15 from Hornell to Dansville and from Mount Morris to <b>Shakers</b> Crossing, the modern junction of NY63 and NY408 northeast of Mount Morris. Between Dansville and Mount Morris, NY36 followed its current alignment. Past <b>Shakers</b> Crossing, NY36 continued northward through Geneseo to Avon on modern NY63 and NY39. The Geneseo–Avon segment of NY36 became part of US20 when that route {{was assigned}} in 1927. South of Hornell, what is now NY36 from Hornell to Jasper became part of NY17 when that route was assigned to most of legislative Route4 in 1924. The remaining sections of contemporary NY36—from Jasper to the Pennsylvania state line and north of Mount Morris—were state-maintained but unnumbered.|$|E

5|$|Plastromancy: The {{earliest}} use of turtle shells {{comes from}} the archaeological site in Jiahu site. The shells, containing small pebbles of various size, colour and quantity, were drilled with small holes, suggesting that each pair of them was tied together originally. Similar finds have also {{been found in the}} Dawenkou burial sites of about 4000–3000 BC, as well as in Henan, Sichuan, Jiangsu and Shaanxi. The turtle-shell <b>shakers</b> for the most part are made of the shell of land turtles, identified as Cuora flavomarginata. Archaeologists believe that these shells were used either as rattles in ceremonial dances, shamantic healing tools or ritual paraphernalia for divinational purposes.|$|E
5|$|The Native Americans {{played the}} first folk music {{in what is}} now the United States, using a wide variety of styles and techniques. Some commonalities are near {{universal}} among Native American traditional music, however, especially the lack of harmony and polyphony, and the use of vocables and descending melodic figures. Traditional instrumentations use the flute and many kinds of percussion instruments, like drums, rattles, and <b>shakers.</b> Since European and African contact was established, Native American folk music has grown in new directions, into fusions with disparate styles like European folk dances and Tejano music. Modern Native American music may be best known for pow wows, pan-tribal gatherings at which traditionally styled dances and music are performed.|$|E

5|$|The Thirteen Colonies of the {{original}} United States were all former English possessions, and Anglo culture became a major foundation for American folk and popular music. Many American folk songs are identical to British songs in arrangements, but with new lyrics, often as parodies of {{the original}} material. American-Anglo songs are also characterized as having fewer pentatonic tunes, less prominent accompaniment (but with heavier use of drones) and more melodies in major. Anglo-American traditional music also includes a variety of broadside ballads, humorous stories and tall tales, and disaster songs regarding mining, shipwrecks, and murder. Legendary heroes like Joe Magarac, John Henry, and Jesse James are part of many songs. Folk dances of British origin include the square dance, descended from the quadrille, combined with the American innovation of a caller instructing the dancers. The religious communal society known as the <b>Shakers</b> emigrated from England during the 18th century and developed their own folk dance style. Their early songs can be dated back to British folk song models. Other religious societies established their own unique musical cultures early in American history, such as {{the music of the}} Amish, the Harmony Society, and the Ephrata Cloister in Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{tunnel and}} flight {{simulator}} {{tests were conducted}} to help to understand the trajectory of the aircraft after the engine detached and the left wing slats retracted. Those tests established that {{the damage to the}} wing's leading edge and retraction of the slats increased the stall speed of the left wing from 124 knots (143mph) to 159 knots (183mph). The DC-10 incorporates two warning devices that might have alerted the pilots to the impending stall: the slat disagreement warning light, which should have illuminated after the uncommanded retraction of the slats, and the stick shaker on the captain's control column, which activates close to the stall speed. Both of these warning devices were powered by an electric generator driven by the number one engine. Both systems became inoperative after the loss of that engine. The first officer's control column was not equipped with a stick shaker; the device was offered by McDonnell Douglas as an option for the first officer, but American Airlines chose not to have it installed on its DC-10 fleet. Stick <b>shakers</b> for both pilots became mandatory in response to this accident.|$|E
5|$|The sound {{equipment}} {{was provided by}} Showco who used the PRISM system, which adapted the show for each venue according to its height, width and the coverage required. The sound was mixed by Front of house engineer Monty Lee Wilkes {{on a combination of}} Yamaha PM4000 and PM3000 consoles, an unusual choice for Spears's shows. He used dbx 903 compressors for kick and snare drums. The compressors were also used on Spears's microphones, a Shure Beta 58A handheld and a Crown CM-311AE headset-mounted capsule. Spears's vocals were mostly live—pre-recorded vocals ran in parallel on an ADAT machine during the shows, and were used to replace her live microphone when the dance routines became too energetic for good voice control. Spears's band, backline technicians and monitor engineer Raza Sufi were all fitted with in-ear monitors and headset mics, enabling rapid and clear communications around the stage area. Spears did not use them, preferring the ambient sound of a battery of eight Showco SRM wedges spread across the downstage area. These were augmented by Showco SS full-range sidefills and a pair of one-by-18-inch subs {{on each side of the}} stage. Sufi also used a dbx 160A to limit Spears's louder moments, while backing vocalists were controlled by a duo of BSS DPR901 dynamic equalizers. Effects were limited to vocal and drum reverbs. Amplification for the wedges and the FOH system were all Crown-based, with a pair of drum stool <b>shakers</b> completing the line-up. All the cables used during the tour were brought from the US, even in Europe, something unusual in audio production.|$|E
