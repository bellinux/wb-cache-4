40|$|Collections of <b>stone</b> <b>crabs</b> {{were made}} at seven {{locations}} near Charleston, South Carolina from July - September 1982. In each location sampled, five commercial wire blue crab traps with two entrance holes and five wooden-lath <b>stone</b> <b>crab</b> traps, {{similar to those used}} in the Florida fishery, were fished for two and three days in paired sets. Twice as many <b>stone</b> <b>crabs</b> were collected in the blue crab trap as in the <b>stone</b> <b>crab</b> trap, and for six of the sites sampled, catches in the blue crab trap were significantly greater than those in the <b>stone</b> <b>crab</b> trap. No significant differences were found in the number of crabs per trap between two-day and three-day sets for either trap type. For all sites sampled, catch per unit of effort showed a decline when plotted against cumulative catch of the blue crab trap, suggesting that either sites were being fished out; that <b>stone</b> <b>crabs</b> were emigrating from these areas; or that they were no longer susceptible to active fishing because of a behavioral change...|$|R

50|$|<b>Stone</b> <b>crabs</b> are {{typically}} found feeding near jetties, oyster reefs, or other rocky areas, {{as well as}} in marshes, such as where blue crabs are, and can be caught with line or in traps. In most jurisdictions, only the right (usually crusher) claw of the Gulf Coast <b>stone</b> <b>crab</b> can be retained, which will regrow, and the crab is returned live to the spot from which it was harvested. The claw must be at least 2.75 in, as measured from the tip claw to the first joint beyond the moveable claw.|$|R
40|$|The <b>stone</b> <b>crab,</b> Menippe mercenaria, {{supported}} {{the third most}} valuable fishery in Florida in 		 2016. Declining catch per unit effort (CPUE) and overall negative trend in landings since 2000 		 have raised concerns among fisherman, researchers, and fishery managers about the resiliency of 		 the fishery. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute estimated that the Florida <b>stone</b> 		 <b>crab</b> fishery has been overexploited since 1997. Overexploited fisheries, such as the commercial 		 <b>stone</b> <b>crab</b> fishery, risk induced changes in life history parameters, such as age at maturation 		 and reproductive output. In turn, these population-level changes {{have the potential to}} reduce the 		 spawning stock biomass and future recruitment to the fishery. The research presented in this 		 dissertation was intended to assess the Florida <b>stone</b> <b>crab</b> fishery stock for: 1) size at sexual 		 maturation in females, 2) size at maturation in males, 3) potential fecundity, modeled as a 		 function of spatial and temporal variables, 4) spawning potential ratios, an index that reveals 		 potential recruitment overfishing, by formulating a per recruit model using the reproductive 		 indices developed in this research, and 5) evaluating the impact of management changes on the 		 spawning stock biomass. The physiological, behavioral, morphological, and functional maturity of female <b>stone</b> 		 <b>crabs</b> were assessed in individuals collected throughout the fished range of the population on 		 the west Florida shelf (Cedar Key – Sawyer Key). Histology was used to determine oocyte maturity, 		 presence of spermatophores, and presence of postovulatory follicles. Decision-tree analysis 		 suggested that 50 % of female <b>stone</b> <b>crabs</b> were mature at 43 mm carapace width, when using a 		 combined variable of physiological and behavioral maturity. The decision tree accurately 		 classified 98 % of mature females and 85 % of immature females. Morphological maturity was 		 assessed using piecewise regression to determine where allometric changes in growth occurred 		 between carapace width and crusher claw length. The transition point between mature and 		 immature females occurred at a carapace width of 66. 3 mm. Differences in estimates of size 		 at sexual maturity between morphological and physiological, behavioral, and functional 		 maturity indicate that relative growth of body parts is not a reliable estimate of sexual 		 maturity in <b>stone</b> <b>crabs.</b> Histological analysis revealed that smaller females are contributing 		 to the spawning population more than previously estimated. The corresponding carapace width at 		 which female <b>stone</b> <b>crab</b> claws are vulnerable to harvest, occurs at 78 mm. The new estimates 		 indicated that females contribute to the spawning population 1 - 2 times prior to vulnerability 		 to the fishery. Continued monitoring of sexual maturity using these methods is recommended to 		 strengthen understanding of the fishery and of interactions between <b>stone</b> <b>crab</b> populations. Two methods were used to assess sexual maturity physiologically and morphologically in 		 male <b>stone</b> <b>crabs</b> collected throughout the range of the fishable population. Histology was 		 used to identify the production of spermatophores in the anterior vas deferens, indicating 		 physiological maturity, and each crab was assigned a maturity stage. Decision-tree analysis 		 suggested that physiological maturity occurred at a carapace width of 34. 8 mm, accurately 		 classifying 98. 9 % of mature males accurately and 72. 5 % of immature males. Piecewise regression 		 estimated that the allometric relationship between carapace width and crusher claw length 		 changed at a carapace width of 63. 1 mm. The difference between physiological and morphological 		 estimates of size at sexual maturity indicates that, like females, changes in male allometric 		 relationships between body parts may not be a reliable indicator of sexual maturity. Large 		 morphometrically mature males may be more successful in mating encounters, but in times of 		 flux in population size structure, morphologically immature, but physiologically mature, 		 males may have more opportunities for successful mating encounters. Carapace width at which 		 male <b>stone</b> <b>crab</b> claws are vulnerable to the fishery occurs at 88 mm, indicating that they 		 are capable of contributing to the reproductive population multiple times prior to 		 vulnerability to the fishery. Multiple factors influencing variability in <b>stone</b> <b>crab</b> batch fecundity were quantified 		 across Florida fishery sites, by implementing a negative binomial model. Fecundity was strongly 		 and positively related to carapace width, and parameter estimates indicated that batch 		 fecundity was on average higher at Pavilion Key (southwest Florida) and Tampa Bay 		 (central Florida), relative to Sawyer Key (south Florida) and Cedar Key (northwest Florida) 		 sites at the northern and southern ends of the study area. Fecundity varied among 2013 - 2016 		 and was highly variable among months. In general, the lowest batch fecundity occurred 		 in winter and spring months, while peak batch fecundity occurred in July and August, 		 highlighting the common seasonal trend in crustacean reproductive cycles. Comparison to a 		 1993 - 1995 study of fecundity estimates in Tampa Bay, Florida indicated that there was 		 little change in <b>stone</b> <b>crab</b> fecundity between individuals collected in 1993 and 2013. 		 However, this temporal relationship accounts for {{a small portion of the}} fished population 		 and may not be reflective of the changes over time across the entire fishery. Although sea 		 surface temperature and ocean color data do not explain the variability in fecundity 		 between sites, I hypothesize that food quality and quantity and fishing effort may play 		 critical role in regionally variable individual reproductive output. I suggest that given 		 the variability in reproductive output and regional fishing practices, that further work 		 be dedicated to identifying critical spawning and recruitment areas to ensure resiliency 		 of the <b>stone</b> <b>crab</b> population. Spawning potential ratios were used to evaluate the impact of alternative biological 		 and management scenarios to the reproductive output in a theoretical <b>stone</b> <b>crab</b> population. 		 The model incorporated the findings of size at maturation and fecundity established in 		 previous chapters, as well as contemporary temperature-dependent declaw mortalities. Spawning 		 potential ratios increased with decreasing size at sexual maturity and were sensitive to past 		 and present estimates of size at sexual maturity, and increasing natural mortality. However, 		 the largest contributor to changes in the fished stock appears to be mortality associated 		 with declawing and releasing <b>stone</b> <b>crabs.</b> We assessed various management scenarios 		 including declaw lengths, vulnerability to capture, and variable season timing and length. 		 Increases in declaw length and size at vulnerability to capture provided moderate protection 		 to the spawning stock. The model estimated that adaptive management regulations which 		 considered the timing and duration of seasonal fishing, based on mean monthly temperatures 		 below 24 °C (temperature at which declaw mortality increases), had the potential to greatly 		 reduce mortality, and provided protection to the spawning population. The model was able to 		 examine a wide range of biological and management scenarios; however, more research should be 		 conducted to determine the socioeconomic impact of regulation changes. The Florida <b>stone</b> 		 <b>crab</b> fishery is an amalgamation of unique fishing practices, rich culture, and both regional 		 and economic influence. Evolving fishing practices, conservation initiatives, and 		 environmental conditions have the potential to transform the fishery. Therefore, fisheries 		 managers, scientists, and stakeholders must work cooperatively to ensure the resiliency of 		 the <b>stone</b> <b>crab</b> fishery...|$|R
