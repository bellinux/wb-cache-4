40|$|In this Letter {{we study}} the {{evolution}} of the higher-order <b>squeezing,</b> namely, nthorder single-mode <b>squeezing,</b> sum- and difference-squeezing for the codirectional Kerr nonlinear coupler. We show that the amount of <b>squeezing</b> decreases when n, i. e. the <b>squeezing</b> order, increases. For specific values of the interaction parameters <b>squeezing</b> factors exhibit a series of revival-collapse phenomena, which become more pronounced when the value of n increases. Sum-squeezing can provide amounts of <b>squeezing</b> greater than those produced by the nth higher-order (n ≥ 2) <b>squeezing</b> for the same values of interaction parameters and can map onto amplitude-squared <b>squeezing.</b> Further, we prove that the difference-squeezing is not relevant measure for obtaining information about <b>squeezing</b> from this device...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{theoretically}} {{investigate the}} displacement and momentum fluctuations spectra of the movable mirror {{in a standard}} optomechanical system driven by a finite bandwidth <b>squeezed</b> vacuum light accompanying a coherent laser field. Two {{cases in which the}} <b>squeezed</b> vacuum is generated by degenerated and non-degenerate parametric oscillators (DPO and NDPO) are considered. We find that for the case of finite bandwidth <b>squeezed</b> vacuum injection, the two spectra exhibit unique features, which strongly differ from those of broadband <b>squeezing</b> excitation. In particular, the spectra exhibit a three-peaked and a four-peaked structure, respectively, for the <b>squeezing</b> injection from DPO and NDPO. Besides, some anomalous characteristics of the spectra such as squeezing-induced pimple, hole burning, and dispersive profile are found to be highly sensitive to the <b>squeezing</b> parameters and the temperature of the mirror. We also evaluate the mean-square fluctuations in position and momentum quadratures of the movable mirror and analyze the influence of the <b>squeezing</b> parameters of the input field on the mechanical <b>squeezing.</b> It will be shown that the parameters of driven <b>squeezed</b> vacuum affects the <b>squeezing.</b> We find the optimal mechanical <b>squeezing</b> is achievable via finite bandwidth <b>squeezed</b> vacuum injection which is affected by the intensity of <b>squeezed</b> vacuum. We also show that the phase of incident <b>squeezed</b> vacuum determines whether position or momentum <b>squeezing</b> occurs. Our proposed scheme not only provides a feasible experimental method to detect and characterize <b>squeezed</b> light by optomechanical systems, but also suggests a way for controllable transfer of <b>squeezing</b> from an optical field to a mechanical oscillator.
