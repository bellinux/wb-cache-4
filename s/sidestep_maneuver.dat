40|$|Fidelity is a {{word that}} is often used but rarely {{understood}} when talking about groundbased simulation. Assessing the cueing fidelity of a ground based flight simulator requires a comparison to actual flight data either directly or indirectly. Two experiments were conducted at the Vertical Motion Simulator using the GenHel UH- 60 A Black Hawk helicopter math model that was directly compared to flight data. Prior to the experiment the simulator s motion and visual system frequency responses were measured, the aircraft math model was adjusted to account for the simulator motion system delays, and the motion system gains and washouts were tuned for the individual tasks. The tuned motion system fidelity was then assessed against the modified Sinacori criteria. The first experiments showed similar handling qualities ratings (HQRs) to actual flight for a bob-up and <b>sidestep</b> <b>maneuvers.</b> The second experiment showed equivalent HQRs between flight and simulation for the ADS 33 slalom maneuver for the two pilot participants. The ADS 33 vertical maneuver HQRs were mixed with one pilot rating the flight and simulation the same while the second pilot rated the simulation worse. In addition to recording HQRs on the second experiment, an experimental Simulation Fidelity Rating (SFR) scale developed by the University of Liverpool was tested for applicability to engineering simulators.

40|$|Introduction: Prophylactic taping is {{commonly}} used to prevent ankle injuries during sports. However, unnatural constraint of the ankle joint may {{increase the risk of}} injury to proximal joints such as the knee. The association between ankle taping and knee joint loading during open sporting tasks has not been quantified. This research aimed to measure changes in knee and ankle kinetics and kinematics during dynamic athletic activities undertaken with and without ankle taping. Methods: A kinematic and inverse dynamics model was used to determine ankle and knee joint motion and loading in 22 healthy male participants undertaking running and sidestepping tasks. Both tasks were randomized to planned and unplanned conditions and undertaken with and without the use of ankle tape. Results: At the knee, peak internal rotation moments (P < 0. 001) and peak varus moments (P < 0. 05) were significantly reduced during all running and sidestepping trials (planned and unplanned) when undertaken with ankle tape. Internal rotation impulse (P < 0. 001) was reduced for sidestepping tasks. Varus impulse during unplanned <b>sidestepping</b> <b>maneuvers</b> (P = 0. 04) was reduced with the use of ankle tape. However, there was a trend toward increased valgus moments and impulse for planned sidestepping trials undertaken with ankle tape (P = 0. 056). Taping reduced the range of motion at the ankle in all three planes (P < 0. 05). Peak inversion (P < 0. 001) was reduced for running trials only. Average eversion and peak dorsiflexion moments were significantly reduced in sidestepping tasks by use of taping. Conclusions: By limiting motion at the ankle, taping increased mechanical stability at this joint. Ankle taping also provided protective benefits to the knee via reduced internal rotation moments and varus impulses during both planned and unplanned maneuvers. Medial collateral and anterior cruciate ligament injuries may, however, occur through increased valgus impulse during sidestepping undertaken with ankle tape...|$|R

The aim of this project is to develop a computational model to analyze how a warming up with mechanical vibrations can a ect the biomechanical behavior of the lower limbs, with a particular attention to the aspects related to the noncontact ACL injuries. For this purpose, a lower limb model is implemented using the OpenSim software (Stanford University) to obtain the evolution of joint angles, joint torques and muscle forces during a <b>sidestep</b> cutting <b>maneuver</b> (before and after warming up).

40|$|We {{consider}} a ship subject to kinematic, dynamic, and moment equations and steered via the rudder under the assumptions that the rudder angle and rudder angle time rate {{are subject to}} upper and lower bounds. We formulate and solve four Mayer problems of optimal control, the optimization criterion being the minimum time. Also, we formulate and solve four Chebyshev problems of optimal control, the optimization criterion being the maximization {{with respect to the}} control history of the minimum value with respect to time of the distance between two identical ships, one maneuvering and one moving in a predetermined way. Problems P 1 and P 2 deal with course change maneuvers. In Problem P 1, a ship initially in quasi-steady state must reach the final point with a given yaw angle and zero yaw angle time rate. Problem P 2 differs from Problem P 1 in that quasi-steady state is required at the final point. Problems P 3 and P 4 deal with <b>sidestep</b> <b>maneuvers.</b> In Problem P 3, a ship initially in quasi-steady state must reach the final point with a given lateral distance, zero yaw angle, and zero yaw angle time rate. Problem P 4 differs from Problem P 3 in that quasi-steady state is required at the final point. Problems P 5 and P 6 deal with collision avoidance maneuvers without cooperation, while Problems P 7 and P 8 deal with collision avoidance maneuvers with cooperation. In Problems P 5 and P 7, the maneuvering ship must reach the final point with a given lateral distance, zero yaw angle, and zero yaw angle time rate. Problems P 6 and P 8 differ from Problems P 5 and P 7 in that quasi-steady state is required at the final point. The above Mayer problems and Chebyshev problems, transformed into Lagrange problems via suitable transformations, are solved via the sequential gradient-restoration algorithm in conjunction with a new singularity avoiding transformation which accounts for the bounds on rudder angle and rudder angle time rate. The optimal control histories involve multiple subarcs along which either the rudder angle is kept at one of the extreme positions or the rudder angle time rate is held at one of the two extreme values. If quasi-steady state is not required at the final point, the total number of subarcs ranges from 4 to 8, depending on the particular problem. If quasi-steady state is required at the final point, the total number of subarcs ranges from 6 to 10, depending on the particular problem: the higher number of subarcs, is due to the additional requirements that the lateral velocity and rudder angle vanish at the final point...|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{noticeable}} change from Tekken 2s fighting system is movement reform - whereas {{the element of}} depth had been largely insignificant in previous Tekken games (aside from some characters having unique <b>sidesteps</b> and dodging <b>maneuvers),</b> Tekken 3 added emphasis on the third axis, allowing all characters to sidestep {{in or out of}} the background by lightly pressing the arcade stick (or tapping the controller button in the console version) towards the corresponding direction. Another big change in movement was that jumping was toned down, no longer allowing fighters to jump to extreme heights (as was present in previous games), but keeping leaps to reasonable, realistic heights. This made air combat more controllable, and put more use to sidestep dodges, as jumping no longer became a universal dodge move that was flying above all of the ground moves. Other than that, the improved engine allowed for quick recoveries from knockdowns, more escapes from tackles and stuns, better juggling (as many old moves had changed parameters, allowing them to connect in combo-situations, where they wouldn't connect in previous games), and extra newly created combo throws.|$|R

Previous {{studies have found that}} dynamic seat does enhance the realism of the cockpit and affect pilots' workload. This investigation, conducted {{under the auspices of the}} Joint Shipboard Helicopter Integration Process (JSHIP), is using a three degree-of-freedom dynamic seat, i. e., heave, surge, and sway, with limited travels in a research simulator configured as a UH- 60 Black Hawk at NASA Ames Research Center. The seat's effectiveness is studied using hover, landing, pirouette, bob-up/bob-down, <b>sidestep,</b> and acceleration/deceleration <b>maneuvers.</b> Seat commands consist of constant vibrations in heave and sway which provide the fundamental vibratory cues. Pilot station accelerations and collective controls provide onset and sustained commands. In addition, transient effects due to translational-lift, collective; and normal acceleration are produced by regulating the magnitude and frequency that depend on the rotor rpm. Results are compared to flight test data and two other ground-based motion systems configurations, i. e., a motion condition with very large motion travels and a motion condition that is comparable with commercial simulator travels.

40|$|Access to thesis {{permanently}} {{restricted to}} Ball State community only. Purpose: Given the elevated risk of sustaining an ACL injury during sidestep cutting, {{and the potential}} differential risk to the two lower extremity limbs between males and females, {{the purpose of this}} study was to investigate the biomechanical differences in males and females between their dominant and non-dominant limbs during unanticipated sidestep cutting. Methods: Twenty-two healthy young adults (11 males and 11 females) performed multiple <b>sidestep</b> cutting <b>maneuvers</b> planting off both the dominant and nondominant limb. Joint kinematics and kinetics of the hip, knee, and ankle joints as well as neuromuscular activation of the gluteus medius, hamstrings, and quadriceps were recorded during each trial. Results: Findings revealed that females were subjected to larger hip adduction loads (p=. 04) while males underwent greater internal rotation (p=. 003) and abduction (p=. 004) loading at the knee during sidestep cutting. Males also had greater pre-activation of the lateral and medial hamstring musculature when compared to females, (p=. 016 and p=. 025 respectively). A secondary analysis found that males within the study had larger adduction moments (p=. 002) and larger external rotation moments (p=. 002) at the knee joint as well as larger vertical GRF (p=. 002) than did their female counterparts. In addition a significant difference was found between limb dominance and loading rate, with the non-dominant limb undergoing larger loading rates (p=. 031). Lastly, correlations between pre- and post- medial hamstring activation revealed a negative relationship with injury risk (p=. 003 and p=. 007 respectively). Conclusions: These findings suggest there may be differential risk of ACL injury between males and females at each joint, females having greater risk at the hip and males and the knee joint. More research should be done to better understand how each joint effects injury risk within and between sexes. As for limb dominance no definitive statement regarding risk discrepancy due to limb dominance can be made. However, future studies should focus on a more specific population of one sport and level of participation to better understand its influence. Thesis (M. S. ...|$|R
40|$|Hamstring strain {{injuries}} (HSIs) are {{the most}} prevalent injury {{in a number of}} sports, and while anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries are less common, they are far more severe and have long-term implications, such as an increased risk of developing osteoarthritis later in life. Given the high incidence and severity of these injuries, they are key targets of injury preventive programs in elite sport. Evidence has shown that a previous severe knee injury (including ACL injury) increases the risk of HSI; however, whether the functional deficits that occur after HSI result in an increased risk of ACL injury has yet to be considered. In this clinical commentary, we present evidence that suggests that the link between previous HSI and increased risk of ACL injury requires further investigation by drawing parallels between deficits in hamstring function after HSI and in women athletes, who are more prone to ACL injury than men athletes. Comparisons between the neuromuscular function of the male and female hamstring has shown that women display lower hamstring-to-quadriceps strength ratios during isokinetic knee flexion and extension, increased activation of the quadriceps compared with the hamstrings during a stop-jump landing task, a greater time required to reach maximal isokinetic hamstring torque, and lower integrated myoelectrical hamstring activity during a <b>sidestep</b> cutting <b>maneuver.</b> Somewhat similarly, in athletes with a history of HSI, the previously injured limb, compared with the uninjured limb, displays lower eccentric knee flexor strength, a lower hamstrings-to-quadriceps strength ratio, lower voluntary myoelectrical activity during maximal knee flexor eccentric contraction, a lower knee flexor eccentric rate of torque development, and lower voluntary myoelectrical activity during the initial portion of eccentric contraction. Given that the medial and lateral hamstrings have different actions at the knee joint in the coronal plane, which hamstring head is previously injured might also be expected to influence the likelihood of future ACL. Whether the deficits in function after HSI, as seen in laboratory-based studies, translate to deficits in hamstring function during typical injurious tasks for ACL injury has yet to be determined but should be a consideration for future work...|$|R
40|$|Quantifying {{simulation}} fidelity – {{the ability}} of a flight simulator to accurately recreate a flight environment – is a challenge that is incomplete. Assessing the cueing fidelity of a ground-based flight simulator requires a comparison with actual flight data. Two experiments conducted at the Vertical Motion Simulator (VMS) compared the handling qualities measured for a UH- 60 A Black Hawk simulation with those obtained from flight for the same tasks. Prior to the experiment, the simulator’s motion and visual system frequency responses were measured and the aircraft math model was adjusted to incorporate the simulator motion system delays, ensuring that the overall helicopter response to control inputs closely matched those of the actual aircraft. The motion system gains and washouts were also adjusted to provide the most realistic motion cues for each evaluation task. The optimized motion system fidelity was then evaluated against the modified Sinacori simulation fidelity assessment criteria. In the first experiment, the handling qualities ratings (HQRs) in the VMS simulation for the <b>Sidestep</b> and Bob-up <b>maneuvers</b> were within one HQR of those given in the flight tests.
