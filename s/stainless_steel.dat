5|$|He {{applied for}} another patent on an alloy he called <b>stainless</b> <b>steel,</b> {{now known as}} {{martensitic}} <b>stainless</b> <b>steel.</b> The Patent Office rejected his application {{saying that it was}} not a new alloy. Haynes conceded their point, but submitted a second application and supplied a sample showing the stainlessness of his alloy when created using his exact proportions of metals, and it was granted. At the urging of his wife, he created the first set of <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> silverware for her personal use. The first piece of <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> was forged by Homer Dan Farmer in Haynes laboratory. It was a large meat knife and was donated to the Haynes Museum by the family of Dan Heflin, grandson of Homer Dan Farmer. In later years he claimed to have created <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> because she did not enjoy polishing their silver tableware. British metallurgist Harry Brearley independently produced an identical alloy around the same time and applied for an American patent and found that one already existed. Brearley had also created other innovations for the metal, but they were of little value without the <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> patent. He sought out Haynes and the two decided to pool their findings in a single company to produce the alloy. Haynes sold his <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> patent in 1918 to the American <b>Stainless</b> <b>Steel</b> Company, a company Brearley had created with the assistance of investors in Pennsylvania. In exchange he and his estate received royalties on its production until the patent expired in 1930. The stock he received as payment allowed him to gain a seat among the company's board of directors and he installed his son, March, to represent him. The income from the transaction led Haynes to begin the accumulation of a large fortune.|$|E

30|$|<b>Stainless</b> <b>steels</b> are {{generally}} regarded {{to be more}} difficult to machine than carbon or low alloy <b>steels</b> [4, 5]. <b>Stainless</b> <b>steels</b> exhibit high ultimate elongation and work hardening [6]. When machining <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> with cemented carbide tools, the physical and mechanical properties of <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> have great influences on the machining process, in which the heat-conducting property and cutting temperature are the crucial factors [7, 8]. Machining of <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> is a very complex process with physical interactions involving cutting temperature, cutting force, plastic deformation, friction, high strain rate, and tool wear or failure [9]. Due to high plasticity of <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> at high cutting temperature, high cutting force and high temperature is generated in machining <b>stainless</b> <b>steels,</b> which produces a situation for adhesion of the workpiece material to the tool and will shorten the tool life [10, 11]. Adhesion occurs under high cutting temperature and high compressive stress. Low thermal conduction rate and high ductility of <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> can lead to the serious built-up edge (BUE) phenomenon in the machining process [12]. High affinity of <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> to tools promotes adhesion to the cutting edge during high-speed machining conditions [13, 14]. Cold weld of workpiece material and tool is formed when cut-out due to relative low environmental temperature [15]. A consequence of the strong bonding between the tool and the material is the formation of different types of transfer and adherent layers during the machining process [16, 17]. Adhesion and tearing alternately occur with the machining process, and severe adhesive wear will appear before the tool reaches its normal wear life [18, 19].|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} 10 - 15 years, a {{considerable}} number of highly alloyed corrosion resistance <b>stainless</b> <b>steels,</b> so called super <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> have been developed.

Typical examples of new super <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> are the nitrogen-alloyed 6 Mo austenitic and 25 Cr duplex steels. The largest application area for these steels has been seawater systems of various kinds. An attempt has been made to determine the corrosion resistance of some typical high alloy <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> viz. 316 L, 317 L, 904 L, duplex 2205, 3127 hMO, 1925 hMO, 254 SMO, 654 SMO and Remanit 4565, in chlorinated and unchlorinated Arabian Gulf Seawater at ambient and 500 C.

LSM of the aged <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> was carried out using a 2. 5. kW CW Nd:YAG laser. The microstructure of the aged <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> after LSM depends on their compositions. After LSM, the aged austenitic <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> mainly contain austenite (γ) with some ferrite (δ) as the minor phase, but the carbide phases are completely eliminated. For the aged duplex <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> after LSM, δ becomes the major phase and the δ/γ phase balance is disturbed, whereas the sigma (σ) phase is eliminated. The degree of sensitization (DOS) and corrosion morphology of the aged <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> before and after LSM were determined by the double loop electrochemical potentiokinetic reactivation (DL-EPR) using a potentiostat and SEM observation, respectively. Desensitization of the aged <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> has been successfully achieved by LSM and their intergranular corrosion resistance {{is found to be}} significantly enhanced as reflected by the decrease in DOS due to dissolution of the carbides or σ phase, which reduced Cr depletion or the possibility of solute segregation at the grain or phase boundaries, despite the presence of δ and disturbance of δ/γ phase balance.
