5|$|Just {{before the}} 1975 tournament, the common beige <b>sand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bunkers was {{replaced}} with the now-signature white feldspar. It is a quartz derivative of the mining of feldspar and is shipped in from North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the initial}} {{attempts}} to dismantle or tow the stern to sea failed, the State of Oregon still intended {{to see the}} remainder of the vessel removed from the beach. In 2006, the state's lawsuit against the ship's owners was settled, clearing the legal obstacles that prevented removal and providing the funds necessary to finance the project. Removal plans were {{complicated by the fact that}} the stern had become deeply embedded in the <b>sand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> seven years since the wreck, with some portions of the stern estimated to be 2030feet (69m) below the sand line.|$|E

5|$|It is {{most common}} amongst the kwongan heath of the Geraldton Sandplains north of Jurien; {{it has a}} fairly {{continuous}} distribution there, often as the dominant species, and extends inland to around the 350mm isohyet. On the Swan Coastal Plain to the south, its distribution is discontinuous, being largely confined to patches of suitable <b>sand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> narrow transition zone where tuart forest gives way to jarrah forest. With {{the exception of a}} population at Point Walter (32°00′S), it does not occur on the sandplain south of the Swan River.|$|E
5|$|Although {{this period}} had been productive, the bad weather {{had such a}} {{detrimental}} effect on Chopin's health that Sand determined to leave the island. To avoid further customs duties, Sand sold the piano to a local French couple, the Canuts. The group traveled first to Barcelona, then to Marseilles, where they stayed {{for a few months}} while Chopin convalesced. In May 1839 they headed for the summer to Sand's estate at Nohant, where they spent most summers until 1846. In autumn they returned to Paris, where Chopin's apartment at 5 rue Tronchet was close to Sand's rented accommodation at the rue Pigalle. He frequently visited <b>Sand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evenings, but both retained some independence. In 1842 he and Sand moved to the Square d'Orléans, living in adjacent buildings.|$|E
5|$|As {{the glaciers}} of the Wisconsin {{glaciation}} began to recede from the Hudson Valley area, a glacial lake {{known today as}} Lake Albany extended across the mid and upper Hudson Valley and a large delta formed west of Albany where the predecessor of the Mohawk River flowed into the lake. Along the shoreline of the lake, lacustrine sands were deposited between the present-day cities of Hudson and Glens Falls; this became the Hudson Valley sandplain. Relieved from {{the weight of the}} glacier, the land began to rebound, and the lake receded by draining into the Hudson River. The deposits of <b>sand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> delta area were gradually sculpted by wind into sand dunes. Plants later colonized the land and stabilized the dunes. The Pine Bush originally occupied , or 60,000 acres, at which point it was the largest inland pine barrens in North America.|$|E

25|$|A {{simpler and}} less {{expensive}} form of arsenic removal {{is known as the}} Sono arsenic filter, using three pitchers containing cast iron turnings and <b>sand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first pitcher and wood activated carbon and <b>sand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second. Plastic buckets can also be used as filter containers. It is claimed that thousands of these systems are in use and can last for years while avoiding the toxic waste disposal problem inherent to conventional arsenic removal plants. Although novel, this filter has not been certified by any sanitary standards such as NSF, ANSI, WQA and does not avoid toxic waste disposal similar to any other iron removal process.|$|E
25|$|Quarrying {{has taken}} place for chalk, clay for brickmaking and gravel and <b>sand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> river valleys. Flint, also {{extracted}} from quarries, was often used to build older local buildings. Several former quarries, now flooded, have become nature reserves.|$|E

25|$|The {{coastal area}} at Bude has sand unusually rich in {{minerals}} {{and the poor}} agricultural land of the locality was found to benefit considerably from application of the <b>sand.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> pre-industrial age, actually transporting it was difficult, even to land relatively close to the coast.|$|E
25|$|B.lindleyana mostly {{occurs on}} the Geraldton Sandplains north of Geraldton toward Shark Bay, {{but there is}} also a {{collection}} from well inland, on the western edge of the Murchison region.

25|$|During the war, up to 2000 {{refugees}} from 20 countries {{were kept in}} Kiruna. German prisoners of war, for example, from crashed airplanes, were kept in Kiruna before being transported south.

25|$|Stretches of <b>sand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> desert are {{interspersed}} by hillocks {{and sandy}} and gravel plains. Due to the diversified habitat and ecosystem, the vegetation, human culture and animal {{life in this}} arid region is very rich {{in contrast to the}} other deserts of the world. About 23 species of lizard and 25 species of snakes are found here and several of them are endemic to the region.|$|E
25|$|HMS Reunion {{remained}} on blockade {{duty in the}} North Sea {{for the rest of}} her career. In July 1796, command of HMS Reunion passed to Acting Captain William Hotham and then to Captain Henry William Bayntun who accidentally wrecked the ship on the Sunk <b>Sand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Thames Estuary on 7 December 1796. Bayntun and his entire crew survived and were later exonerated of blame for the loss of the ship.|$|E
25|$|Care for {{telescopic}} {{fishing rods}} {{is much the}} same as other rods. The only difference being that one should not open the telescopic rod in manner that whips a closed rod into the open position rapidly. Whipping or flinging a telescopic fishing rod open may and likely will cause it to be difficult to close. When closing the rods make a slight twisting motion while pushing the sections together. Often the rods come with tip covers to protect the tip and guides. Additionally, extra care must be taken not to get dirt or <b>sand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> joints; due to their design this can easily damage this style of rod.|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} colonial era, there {{also used to}} be low mounds of whitish <b>sand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area, earning the street the {{familiar}} Hokkien (Min Nan) moniker of Peh Soa Pu or Bai Sha Fu in Mandarin (白沙浮; white sand mounds). The Cantonese, however, referred to the street as Hak Gaai or Hei Jie in Mandarin (黑街; black street) as there were many clubs catering to the Japanese invaders in the 1940s. During {{the first half of}} the 20th century, commuters could conveniently travel from Bugis Street to anywhere else in Xiao Po via a tram service which ran along North Bridge Road, which was referred to by the Chinese-educated as Xiao Po Da Ma Lu (小坡大马路; little slope main road).|$|E
25|$|Farther east {{the terrain}} changes {{abruptly}} {{to the flat}} lowlands of the coastal plain. This area, about sixty kilometers wide, is generally featureless and covered with gravel or <b>sand.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> north is the Ad Dibdibah graveled plain and in the south the 'Al Jafurah sand desert, which reaches the gulf near Dhahran and merges with the Rub al Khali at its southern end. The coast itself is extremely irregular, merging sandy plains, marshes, and salt flats almost imperceptibly with the sea. As a result, the land surface is unstable; in places water rises almost to the surface, and the sea is shallow, with shoals and reefs extending far offshore. Only the construction of long moles at Ras Tanura has opened the Saudi coast on the gulf to seagoing tankers.|$|E
25|$|Trying {{to prevent}} another Turkish {{attack against the}} Suez Canal, Murray reorganized his troops and led a counterattack, winning a victory at Romani in August 1916. He now had to advance over the Sinai Peninsula, which {{consisted}} of <b>sand</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north, gravel and clay in the centre and mountains in the south. 400 miles of railway, 300 miles of metalled and wire-meshed roads and 300 miles of pipes had to be laid. Drinking water had to be pumped underneath the Suez Canal from the Sweet Water Canal in the Nile Delta, requiring the construction of filtration plants, reservoirs and pumping stations. The line on the frontier was 45 miles in width, half {{the width of the}} 80–90 mile front on the Canal. Murray captured El Arish in December and Rafa on the Palestine frontier in January 1917.|$|E
