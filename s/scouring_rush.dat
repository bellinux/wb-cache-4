5000|$|The living {{members of}} the genus Equisetum are divided into two {{distinct}} lineages, which are usually treated as subgenera. The name of the type subgenus, Equisetum, means [...] "horse hair" [...] in Latin, while {{the name of the}} other subgenus, Hippochaete, means [...] "horse hair" [...] in Greek. Hybrids are common, but hybridization has only been recorded between {{members of the}} same subgenus. [...] While plants of subgenus Equisetum are usually referred to as horsetails, those of subgenus Hippochaete are often called <b>scouring</b> <b>rushes,</b> especially when unbranched.|$|R

Other common names include dwarf horsetail, sedge horsetail, prele faux-scirpe (Qué), tradfräken (Swe), dvergsnelle (Nor), trad-padderok (Dan), hentokorte (Fin), dwergholpijp (NL), himedokusa (Jpn), skrzyp arktyczny (PL).|$|E
50|$|Equisetum laevigatum is {{a species}} of {{horsetail}} known by the common names smooth horsetail and smooth <b>scouring</b> <b>rush.</b> This plant is native to much of North America except for northern Canada and southern Mexico. It is usually found in moist areas in sandy and gravelly substrates. It may be annual or perennial. It grows narrow green stems sometimes reaching heights exceeding 1.5 meters. The leaves at the nodes are small, scale-like brownish sheaths and there are occasionally small, spindly branches. The stems are topped with rounded cone-shaped sporangia.|$|E
50|$|Along {{the river}} {{there are two}} major plant communities. The {{floodplain}} forest includes willow and cottonwood. The bluffs are covered by elm and oak. The annual floods create a variation of floodplain vegetation and succession throughout the park. New deposits such as sandbars and accretions adjacent to the riverbanks are covered with the pioneer species: annual weeds, short-lived grasses, sedges, and seedling willow and cottonwood. On higher above the water table, larger willow and cottonwood trees dominate. The floodplain forest includes larger cottonwoods on the highest banks and islands. The understory in the cottonwood forest is primarily dogwood, sumac, wild grape, and poison ivy. The sparse vegetation under the mature cottonwoods consists mostly of <b>scouring</b> <b>rush,</b> Kentucky bluegrass, smooth brome, and other invasive grasses and weeds.|$|E
5000|$|... 325 {{million years}} ago Illinois was covered in heavily forested deltaic swamps. The trees {{composing}} this Pennsylvanian forest included Cordaites, scale trees, and seal trees. Some of these trees could grow over 100 feet high. The rest of the flora included <b>scouring</b> <b>rushes,</b> Sphenophyllum, ferns, and seed ferns. The fossils they left behind include casts, molds, compressions, and even entire plant preserved in nodules. [...] Rivers running through the ancient swamps swept leaves and plant debris out to sea. The environment of Pennsylvanian Illinois was comparable to the modern Amazon River delta. Almost every Pennsylvanian deposit in Illinois preserves evidence of this ancient flora and such deposits are located in almost every region of the state. The vegetation of these ancient swamps became Illinois' modern coal deposits.|$|R
40|$|The element silicon, Si, {{represents}} an anomaly in plant physiology (Epstein, 1994, 1999 b). Plants contain the element in amounts {{comparable to those}} of such macronutrient elements as phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, viz. at tissue concentrations (dry weight basis) of about 0. 1 - 10 %, although both lower and higher values may be encountered. In some plants, such as rice and sugarcane, Si may be the mineral element present in largest amount. In much of plant physiological research, however, Si is considered a nonentity. Thus, not a single formulation of the widely used nutrient solutions includes Si. Experimental plants grown in these solutions are therefore abnormally low in their content of the element, being able to obtain only what Si is present as an unavoidable contaminant of the nutrient salts used, and from the experimental environment and their own seeds. The reason for the astonishing discrepancy between the prominence of Si in plants and its neglect in much of the enterprise of plant physiological research is that Si does not qualify as an ''essential'' element. Ever since the introduction of the solution culture method {{in the middle of the}} last century (Epstein, 1999 a, b) it has been found that higher plants can grow in nutrient solutions in the formulation of which Si is not included. The only exceptions are the Equisitaceae (horsetails or <b>scouring</b> <b>rushes),</b> for which Si is a quantitatively major essential element...|$|R
40|$|Originating in the Nebraska Sand Hills, the South Loup River flows 30 km {{north of}} Kearney, Nebraska and {{traverses}} {{the northern edge}} of Buffalo County as it flows eastward to its confluence with the Middle Loup River in southwestern Howard County. Several diverse plant communities are associated with the South Loup Valley, including wet-meadows, wetland/oxbows, sand prairie, and riparian forest. Over a period of 6 years (2006 - 2012), we surveyed representative wet meadow, wetland, and sand prairie communities. We compiled an annotated vascular plant checklist that included 324 vascular plant species of which 11 were new county records. Three species of <b>scouring</b> <b>rushes</b> (Equisetophyta) were also listed. Approximately 84. 1 % (276 species) were native and 15. 9 % (52) were exotics. The mean coefficient of conservatism (Cm) values for the wet meadow, sand prairie, and wetland sites were 3. 51, 3. 61, and 4. 25 respectively. The floristic quality indices (FQI) were 52. 42 for the wet meadow, 32. 49 for the sand prairie, and 34. 26 for the wetland/oxbow. Several noteworthy sedge species collected in this study were bristly sedge (Carex comosa), shoreline sedge (C. hyalinolepis), ripgut sedge (C. lacustris), and smoothcane sedge (C. laeviconica). Forbs at the west edge of their range included Sullivant’s milkweed (Asclepias sullivantii) and three-seeded mercury (Acalypha rhomboidea). A major objective of our study was to substantiate the significance of the South Loup River Valley to the species richness and flora of Nebraska and the Great Plains...|$|R

40|$|An {{electron}} microprobe (EMP) {{analysis of}} silica (SiO 2) deposition in the epidermis of developing internodes of the perennial <b>scouring</b> <b>rush</b> (Equisetum hyemale var. affine) indicates that SiO 2 is first {{detected in the}} stomatal apparatus beginning with internode 3, then the epidermal papillae (internode 8), and finally in radial cell walls of the long epidermal cells (internode 10). This process is initiated in the intercalary growth regions at the bases of the elongating internodes. The deposition of SiO 2 in long epidermal cell walls occurs after internodal extension has ceased and should therefore be considered {{as one of the}} final stages in internodal differentiation that involves strengthening the cellulosic framework of the cell wall. EMP measurements indicate that SiO 2 in stomata is equivalent to 30 % of a pure SiO 2 standard and that SiO 2 in the radial walls of long epidermal cells averages twice that measured on the tangential walls of these same cells. This study supports the view that silicification {{plays a major role in}} strengthening the developing perennial <b>scouring</b> <b>rush</b> internodal system and that regulation of this process in this and other species of Equisetum, whose SiO 2 deposition patterns are markedly different, deserves further study...|$|E

40|$|Four {{hydropower}} operational scenarios at Flaming Gorge Dam {{were evaluated}} {{to determine their}} potential effects on riparian vegetation along the Green River in Utah and Colorado. Data collected in June 1992 indicated that elevation above the river had the largest influence on plant distribution. A lower riparian zone occupied the area between the approximate elevations of 800 and 4, 200 -cfs flows [...] the area {{within the range of}} hydropower operational releases. The lower zone was dominated by wetland plants such as cattail, common spikerush, coyote willow, juncus, and carex. An upper riparian zone was above the elevation of historical maximum power plant releases from the dam (4, 200 cfs), and it generally supported plants adapted to mesic, nonwetland conditions. Common species in the upper zone included box elder, rabbitbrush, grasses, golden aster, and <b>scouring</b> <b>rush.</b> Multispectral aerial videography of the Green River was collected in May and June 1992 to determine the relationship between flow and the areas of water and the riparian zone. From these relationships, it was estimated that the upper zone would decrease in extent by about 5 % with year-round high fluctuation, seasonally adjusted high fluctuation, and seasonally adjusted moderate fluctuation, but it would increase by about 8 % under seasonally adjusted steady flow. The lower zone would increase by about 13 % for both year-round and seasonally adjusted high fluctuation scenarios but would decrease by about 40 % and 74 % for seasonally adjusted moderate fluctuation and steady flows, respectively. These changes are considered to be relatively minor and would leave pre-dam riparian vegetation unaffected. Occasional high releases above power plant capacity would be needed for long-term maintenance of this relict vegetation...|$|E
