40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{effectiveness}} of an externally activated self-repairing technique for concrete members with epoxy injection network and Cu-Al-Mn superelastic alloy (SEA) reinforcing bars (rebars). Compared to existing crack self-repairing and self-healing techniques, the epoxy injection network has the following strengths: (1) Different from the self-repairing methods using brittle containers or tubes for adhesives, the proposed self-repair process can be performed repeatedly and is feasible for onsite concrete casting. (2) Different from the autogenic self-healing techniques, full strength recovery can be achieved in a shorter time period without the necessity of water. This paper attempts to enhance the self-repairing capability of the epoxy injection network by reducing residual cracks by using cost-effective Cu-based SEA bars. The effectiveness of the present technique is examined using concrete beam specimens reinforced by 3 types of bars. The first specimen is reinforced by steel deformed bars, the second by <b>steel</b> <b>threaded</b> bars, and finally by SEA threaded rebars. The tests were performed with a 3 point cyclic loading with increasing amplitude.

40|$|This study {{presents}} an innovative bridge column technology for application in seismic regions. The proposed technology combines a precast post-tensioned composite steel-concrete hollow-core column with supplemental energy dissipation, {{in a way}} to reduce on-site construction burdens and minimize earthquake-induced residual deformations, damage, and associated repair costs. The column consists of two steel cylindrical shells, with high -performance concrete cast in between. Both shells act as permanent formwork; the outer shell substitutes the longitudinal and transverse reinforcement, as it works in composite action with the concrete, whereas the inner shell removes unnecessary concrete volume from the column, prevents concrete implosion, and prevents buckling of energy dissipating dowels when embedded in the concrete. Large inelastic rotations can be accommodated at the end joints with minimal structural damage, since gaps are allowed to open at these locations and to close upon load reversal. Longitudinal post-tensioned high-strength <b>steel</b> <b>threaded</b> bars, designed to respond elastically, in combination with gravity forces ensure self-centering behavior.

The objective of the test series {{is to provide a}} robust method of connection for structural engineering that is both fatigue and slip resistant. Forty-six joints (using 23 specimens) were subjected to either static or combined static/cyclic loading at ambient room temperature. Ten specimens (five batches of two) had bolted connections without injected resin and were included to provide baseline static joint strengths. Sikadur®- 30 and RenGel®-SW 404 were the two cold-curing epoxy based resins used to fabricate the 13 RIBJ specimens. Testing was conducted with double lap-shear joints in accordance with modified guidance from Annex G and Annex K in standard BS EN 1090 - 2 : 2008. The specimen’s geometry was established using this British Standard and an American Society of Civil Engineers pre-standard for pultruded thin-walled structures. Rectangular plates for the lap joints were cut from either a wide flange section of size 254 × 254 × 9. 53 mm or a flat sheet of 6. 35 mm thickness.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental study undertaken {{to investigate the}} seismic behavior of full scale square (300 x 300 mm) RC columns strengthened with two alternative systems employing carbon FRP wraps. The first system (“type A”) consists of placing four <b>steel</b> <b>threaded</b> rods inside grooves cut into the concrete which were anchored into {{the foundation for a}} length of about 250 mm; then the strengthening is completed by external CFRP confinement. The second system (“type B”), instead, differs from the first one for the additional use of steel profiles at the column corners. Tests were performed by subjecting the specimens to combined axial and lateral loads applied in displacement control. A value of the normalized compression load (NCL) equal to 0. 40 was considered for all tests except one for which NCL = 0. 14 was adopted. Table 1 summarizes the main data and results of the six performed tests. Each test is identified by a label providing the following information: the column number (from C 1 to C 5) with the addition of “NS” (i. e., “new series”) the longitudinal steel reinforcement type (“D” stands for deformed rebars); the strengthening system (type ‘‘A’’ or ‘‘B’’). It is noted that the test C 1 NS-D-R refers to the control specimen C 1 NS-D that, after being tested, was repaired and FRP retrofitted according to the layout “type A”. In order to better compare the effectiveness of the considered strengthening techniques, Table 1 also reports data and results of two tests performed in a previous experimental campaign, namely C 24 -D-A 1 and C 15 -D-A 1. These specimens were strengthened using a system “type A 1 ”, characterized by the combined use of CFRP confinement and steel profiles connected to the foundation by using an L-shape steel system. Under high axial load (NCL= 0. 40) the strengthened specimens have exhibited increases of strength ranging from 48 to 60 %. The improvement of the column’s confinement through the addition of steel profiles (system “type B”) avoids the rupture of the FRP wrapping and delays the crushing of the concrete; indeed, after the achievement of the conventional collapse, the strengthened specimens are still capable of undergoing significant lateral displacements. By focusing on the system “type A”, it is highlighted that using a double FRP layer (test C 3 NS-D-A) delays the FRP fracture, so that the displacements exhibited by the specimen are about 30 % over those measured for the counterpart confined with a single FRP layer...|$|E

Restriction set on 08. 08. 2017 by SE, Doctoral CollegeSilver is {{a precious}} metal that {{has traditionally been}} used for jewellery and money. It also possesses desirable properties such as being corrosion resistant and having good electrical conductivity, resulting in its use for industrial applications. Furthermore, it is also recognised for its tribological properties in non-cost prohibitive applications. Silver {{can be used as}} a surface coating and can be deposited using an electroplating process. The utilisation of silver as a surface coating is advantageous and sustainable, as the substrate material properties are enhanced while usage of silver is kept to a minimum. On the other hand, electroplating has been used for over a century. It is a process which is able to produce a layer of uniform and dense coating that adheres well to the substrate metal, thus modifying the properties of the substrate. It benefits from being relatively low cost and is scalable. Silver is electroplated onto stainless <b>steel</b> <b>threaded</b> compression fittings to prevent galling. Traditional silver electroplating, which contains the use of cyanide as a complexing agent in the electroplating bath, is still in use within industry, even to this day. Cyanide, in its various forms can be poisonous, toxic and even lethal, which presents a risk during the silver electroplating process. Furthermore, the toxic wastes created during the cyanide silver electroplating process are detrimental to the environment. The aim of this work is to develop a self-lubricating non-cyanide silver PTFE composite coating suitable for use in threaded compression fittings of the ferruled type. The composite can be considered self-lubricating when a concentration of 8 % or more by volume of the self-lubricating PTFE substance is incorporated. My original contribution to knowledge is firstly the successful development and characterisation of a self-lubricating non-cynanide Ag-PTFE coating on stainless steel without a strike resulting in improved CoF of 0. 06 from the CoF of 0. 6 based on an unlubricated surface. Secondly is the application of a non-cyanide Ag-PTFE MMC for threaded compression fittings. Thirdly is the characterisation of the make-up process of threaded compression fittings through the proposed use of the torque-angle slope in assessing coating performance for threaded compression fittings during make-up. Conclusions that can be drawn for the work are that the performance non-cyanide Ag-PTFE coating exceeded the performance of the pure Ag coating made using the same non-cyanide process. Moreover, the performance of the Ag-PTFE coating shows promising results when compared to the performance of the commercial silver cyanide coating. As a viable replacement to the current silver cyanide process, the self-lubricating non-cyanide Ag-PTFE coating, will improve the working conditions and have a positive contribution to the environment.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work is to investigate the ultimate load, behaviour characteristics and failure modes of <b>threaded</b> <b>steel</b> fasteners subjected to various combinations of tension and shear loads at elevated deformation rates. <b>Threaded</b> <b>steel</b> fasteners are often used to assemble members and components in engineering structures, and the behaviour characteristics of each individual fastener can have a significant influence {{on the performance of}} the total structure. Hence, before the response of a structure can be determined based on a given load scenario the behaviour of each of the involved components and joints must be known as well as the material behaviour at the deformation rates representative for the load situation. The work carried out in this thesis is presented in a synopsis, providing the background, the objectives, the strategy and a summary of the project. Then three individual papers/parts follow where two have been published in peer reviewed journals and the third has been submitted for potential journal publication. The first two papers are dealing with the tensile behaviour of <b>threaded</b> <b>steel</b> fasteners at elevated rates of strain. The objective was to investigate the ultimate tensile load, behaviour characteristics and failure modes. In the first paper, results and observation from the experimental study were presented, and the Alexander model was modified to consider the ultimate load and mode of failure at high loading rates. In the second paper, results from a numerical study were presented. The numerical study was based on the experimental results obtained from the first part. An axisymmetric finite element model was used to predict the tension behaviour characteristics and the failure modes of the <b>threaded</b> <b>steel</b> fasteners. Comparison of results between simulations and experiments showed that the axisymmetric finite element model captured the ultimate load and the overall behaviour characteristics with good accuracy. It was observed that the failure modes were influenced by the thread engagement length, the grip length and the strain-rate. The third paper explores the ultimate load and behaviour characteristics of <b>threaded</b> <b>steel</b> fasteners exposed to combined tension and shear load at elevated deformation rates. An experimental and a numerical study were conducted. In the experimental study, the loading angle was 0 °, 45 ° and 90 °, where 0 ° corresponded to loading along the axis of the <b>threaded</b> <b>steel</b> fasteners. The numerical study was carried out using a three-dimensional finite element model. Simulations were performed at the same deformation rates as in the experiments, while the load was applied at different angles varying between 0 º and 90 º with 15 º intervals.
