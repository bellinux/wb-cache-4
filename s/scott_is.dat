It is located in the southern Blue Ridge Mountains near Blood Mountain.|$|E
5|$|In Earth 2, Green Lantern Alan Scott was {{revealed}} as gay. In issue 3, <b>Scott</b> <b>is</b> revealed {{to have a}} boyfriend named Sam, to whom he intends to propose while on vacation in China. Before he can do so, however, the train on which the couple is travelling is suddenly wrecked.

5|$|<b>Scott</b> <b>is</b> {{presumed to}} have died on 29 March 1912, or {{possibly}} one day later. The positions of the bodies in the tent when it was discovered eight months later suggested that Scott {{was the last of}} the three to die.|$|E
5|$|The {{small lake}} {{is a local}} {{favorite}} for fishing. Lake Winfield <b>Scott</b> <b>is</b> stocked with rainbow trout and also contains local species of warmwater fish such as largemouth bass and sunfish. Also on the lake are a boat ramp, boat dock and swimming area with a sand beach. The Forest Service allows only man-powered and electric-powered watercraft on the lake.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Scott</b> <b>was</b> {{married in}} {{approximately}} 1886 to Mary (or May) Zell.

50|$|<b>Scott</b> <b>was</b> born on July 4, 1924, in Van Horn, Texas, {{the son of}} Claude Winfred and Maggie Elizabeth Scott. He {{had four}} {{siblings}} and the family left Van Horn in 1926 and moved to Best, Texas, when <b>Scott</b> <b>was</b> two years old.

5|$|Collectors {{tend to use}} the {{catalogues}} {{produced in}} their own region and language, so in the United States, <b>Scott</b> <b>is</b> used most often {{as evidenced by the}} use of Scott numbers in American stamp auction catalogues. In contrast, SG numbers are used in England and Ireland because Stanley Gibbons (a British publisher) produces the catalogue of choice in those countries. Advanced and more specialist collectors have used the David Feldman, later called MacDonnell/Feldman, and later again called MacDonnellWhyte, catalogues between 1978 and 1991, and Hibernian catalogues (1972, 1976, 1980, 1983, 1985, 1986, 2002 and 2009 editions).|$|E
5|$|Lake Winfield <b>Scott</b> <b>is</b> 4.5 {{miles east}} of Suches on Highway 180 and 7.1 miles west of U.S. Highway 19/129 near Vogel State Park. Two roads provide access to the park, {{although}} the north entrance is only for lake access. The south entrance leads to the campgrounds, hiking trails and lakeshore facilities. The hardwood forests surrounding the lake and in Sosebee Gap offer brilliant autumn displays, making it a popular destination during the leaf season.|$|E
5|$|Peveril of the Peak (1823) by Sir Walter <b>Scott</b> <b>is</b> a {{historical}} novel set at Peveril Castle, Castleton {{during the reign}} of Charles II. William Wordsworth was a frequent visitor to Matlock; the Peak inspired several of his poems, including an 1830 sonnet to Chatsworth House. The village of Morton in Charlotte Brontë's 1847 novel Jane Eyre is based on Hathersage, where Brontë stayed in 1845, and Thornfield Hall might have been inspired by nearby North Lees Hall. Snowfield in George Eliot's first novel Adam Bede (1859) is believed to be based on Wirksworth, where her uncle managed a mill; Ellastone (as Hayslope) and Ashbourne (as Oakbourne) are also featured.|$|E
50|$|<b>Scott</b> <b>was</b> {{first elected}} to the Peter Kiewit Sons' Incorporated board in 1964. In 1979, he was elected president. When Peter Kiewit died later that same year, <b>Scott</b> <b>was</b> {{selected}} to succeed him as chairman.|$|R
25|$|<b>Scott</b> <b>was</b> born at Toorak, Victoria on 26 December 1858 to John and Elizabeth <b>Scott.</b> His father <b>was</b> {{secretary}} of the Melbourne Gas and Coke Company. <b>Scott</b> <b>was</b> educated at Wesley College and the University of Melbourne, from which he {{and two of his}} brothers graduated in medicine.|$|R

5|$|Shortly after Darren {{returns to}} Hollyoaks village from America three years later, Darren begins a {{skimming}} scam which {{is found out}} by his boss Scott who refuses to give him time off work. In retaliation he plants incriminating evidence on Scott's computer before calling the police. Scott sets fire to The Loft with Darren inside, but Scott becomes trapped and Darren leaves him for dead. Darren is told no trace of Scott has been found, but <b>Scott</b> <b>is</b> alive and sends threatening postcards to Darren. Scott attacks Darren, who pleads with Scott not to kill him, but the police arrive shortly after.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} of the Royal Albert Hall (built in 1867–1871 to the designs of Francis Fowke and Henry Young Darracott <b>Scott)</b> <b>is</b> embellished with a mosaic frieze composed of sixteen separate designs by multiple artists. This was assembled from 800 slabs prepared by attendees of the South Kensington Museum's mosaic class; the terracotta was manufactured by Minton, Hollins and Company. The designs are listed below in anti-clockwise order from the north.|$|E
5|$|Another change made in Emerald is the {{addition}} of Team Magma's base {{on the side of}} Mt. Chimney; moreover, the legendary Pokémon Groudon is found here, rather than in the Cave of Origin. Even though the locations of the legendary Pokémon are different, Team Magma still makes the mistake of taking the blue orb to Groudon, while Team Aqua still makes the mistake of taking the red orb to Kyogre. A new character named <b>Scott</b> <b>is</b> also introduced in this game. Unknown to the player, he is the creator of the Battle Frontier. He follows the player throughout the game, watching them battle each Gym Leader and even meeting up with them when they get to the Battle Frontier.|$|E

50|$|<b>Scott</b> <b>was</b> on the MSU faculty from 1960-1998, when {{he retired}} as {{professor}} emeritus. He was also the William L. Giles Distinguished Professor of History from 1978-1998. In 1989, <b>Scott</b> <b>was</b> {{elected president of the}} Mississippi Historical Association.|$|R
50|$|<b>Scott</b> <b>was</b> a distiller.|$|R
5|$|Another {{way that}} machinima {{demonstrates}} intertextuality {{is in its}} tendency to make frequent references to texts, works, and other media just like TV ads or humorous cartoons such as The Simpsons might do. For example, the machinima series Freeman's Mind, created by Ross <b>Scott,</b> <b>is</b> filmed by taking a recording of Scott playing through the game Half Life as a player normally would and combining it with a voiceover (also recorded by Scott) to emulate an inner monologue of the normally voiceless protagonist Gordon Freeman. Scott portrays Freeman as a snarky, sociopathic character who makes frequent references to works and texts including science fiction, horror films, action movies, American history, and renowned novels such as Moby Dick. These references to works outside the game, often triggered by events within the game, are prime examples of the densely intertextual nature of machinima.|$|E
5|$|IR's John Tracy (Barrett), who {{has been}} {{monitoring}} radio traffic from the space station Thunderbird 5, relays news of the unfolding events to Tracy Island. Jeff (Peter Dyneley) immediately dispatches Scott (Shane Rimmer) and Virgil (David Holliday) in Thunderbirds 1 and 2 – the latter carrying Pod 3 – to London. Arriving at the danger zone, Scott assures Norman of IR's good intentions, in return demanding his word that no photographs will be taken of either aircraft. However, the Hood, disguised {{as one of the}} airport police detachment, breaks into the unmanned Thunderbird 1 and photographs the cockpit. <b>Scott</b> <b>is</b> alerted by the Automatic Camera Detector and the Hood flees, chased along the M1 motorway by the police.|$|E
5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{interviews}} {{for a job}} in Philadelphia, where she finds her potential manager, Mark (Bob Odenkirk), is remarkably like her former Dunder Mifflin regional manager Michael Scott. While this initially amuses her, Pam gradually realizes that the prospect of working under another Michael <b>Scott</b> <b>is</b> abhorrent, and her horror increases when Mark reveals that she is interviewing for a glorified receptionist's job. During a romantic dinner, Pam finally admits to Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that even had the prospective job and boss been perfect she would not have wanted to take it, since she does not really want to move to Philadelphia, despite Jim having started his own business there.|$|E
50|$|After Mark Richt {{was hired}} as the Hurricanes head coach, <b>Scott</b> <b>was</b> hired by head coach Butch Jones to serve as tight ends coach for the Tennessee Volunteers in 2016. <b>Scott</b> <b>was</b> {{promoted}} to Offensive Coordinator after the 2016 season.|$|R
