40|$|Background: Following {{anterior}} cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture, the knee becomes unstable with alterations in joint kinematics including anterior tibial displacement (ATD), and internal tibial rotation. Therapeutic exercises that promote faulty kinematics should be discouraged, especially early post-reconstruction, to avoid graft stretching and possibly longer-term osteoarthritis. Our study aimed to compare ATD and tibial rotation during two commonly prescribed exercises, namely: open kinetic chain (OKC) <b>seated</b> <b>extension</b> and closed kinetic chain (CKC) single leg wall squatting in ACL-deficient and healthy knees. Methods: Eight ACL-deficient patients and eight healthy subjects matched for age, gender and sports history were assessed using Qualisys 3 D-Motion Analysis System to track 17 infrared markers while performing a <b>seated</b> knee <b>extension</b> with 3 kg weight and a unilateral wall squat. We developed a model to measure joint kinematics through 70 ° of knee flexion and extension. ANOVA and paired t-tests compared relative ATD and tibial rotation between exercises and groups at 10 ° increments of flexion and extension. Results: We found increased ATD in the wall squat compared to the <b>seated</b> <b>extension</b> (p = 0. 049). There {{was no difference in}} ATD between the healthy and ACL-deficient knees but overall the tibia was significantly more internally rotated (p = 0. 003) in ACL-deficient knees, irrespective of the exercise, possibly interfering with the screw-home mechanism. Conclusions: CKC exercises, in particular wall squats, are not necessarily safer for patients with ACL-deficiency and possibly ACL-reconstruction; although generalization should only be made with appropriate caution. Clinicians require a detailed knowledge of the effect of exercise on knee joint kinematics...|$|R
40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at Springer via [URL] We have previously shown that the lumbar spine has an intrinsic shape specific to the individual and characteristic of sitting, standing and supine postures. The {{purpose of this study}} was to test the hypothesis that this intrinsic shape is detectable throughout a range of postures from extension to full flexion in healthy adults. METHODS: Sagittal images of the lumbar spine were taken using a positional MRI with participants (n = 30) adopting six postures: <b>seated</b> <b>extension,</b> neutral standing, standing with 30, 45 and 60 ° and full flexion. Active shape modelling (ASM) was used to identify and quantify 'modes' of variation in the shape of the lumbar spine. RESULTS: ASM showed that 89. 5 % of the variation in the shape of the spine could be explained by the first two modes; describing the overall curvature and the distribution of curvature of the spine. Mode scores were significantly correlated between all six postures (modes 1 - 9, r = 0. 4 - 0. 97, P < 0. 05), showing that an element of intrinsic shape was maintained when changing postures. The spine was most even in <b>seated</b> <b>extension</b> (P < 0. 001) and most uneven between 35 and 45 ° flexion (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that an individual's intrinsic lumbar spine shape is quantifiable and detectable throughout lumbar flexion and extension. These findings will enable the role of lumbar curvature in injury and low back pain to be assessed in the clinic and in the working and recreational environments.

The question to be answered was: Does fatigue of the quadriceps muscles impact force production of the hamstring muscles? A convenience sample from a small private university of 12 students (male= 4, female= 8) participated in the study, ages 20 - 22 years. Data was collected at the University’s fitness center. On day one, a base line 1 RM quadriceps extension and hamstring curl was measured on <b>seated</b> leg <b>extension</b> and <b>seated</b> hamstring curl machine. Forty-eight hours later, on test day two, the quadriceps were fatigued on the <b>seated</b> leg <b>extension</b> machine using 65 % of the 1 RM leg extension.

40|$|Patellofemoral pain {{syndrome}} (PFPS) is {{a common}} source of anterior knee pain. While treatment for PFPS may {{be successful in the}} short term, long-term results are less promising. The {{purpose of this study was}} to record long-term pain and functionality outcomes following rehabilitation in patients affected by PFPS. A prospective cohort study of 44 patients with a diagnosis of PFPS and an activation imbalance between the vastus medialis obliquus (VMO) and vastus lateralis (VL) muscles were enrolled. Patients underwent patellar taping (2 weeks) followed by a rehabilitation program lasting until the end of the third month. Primary outcome measures were pain and the functional level of the patellofemoral joint. Secondary outcome measures were surface electromyographic (sEMG) onset timing of the VMO/VL during <b>seated</b> knee <b>extension</b> and squat and isometric knee extensor muscle strength. Significant differences in all the outcome measures were observed between the affected and unaffected sides before treatment. The pain score significantly decreased both posttreatment (Delta=- 4. 7; 95 % CI=- 5. 4 to - 3. 9) and at the 12 -month follow-up (Delta=- 5. 5; 95 % CI=- 6. 1 to - 4. 8), while the functional level significantly increased both posttreatment (Delta= 24; 95 % CI= 18. 3 to 30. 2) and at the 12 -month follow-up (Delta= 26; 95 % CI= 21. 4 to 30. 6).

40|$|Anterior {{cruciate}} ligament injury leads to increased sagittal tibial translation, {{and perceptions of}} instability and low confidence in the knee joint are common. Many patients have remaining problems despite treatment and are forced to lower their activity level and prematurely end their career in sports. The effect of ACL reconstruction and/or rehabilitation on dynamic knee stability is not completely understood. The overall aim of this thesis was to study the dynamic knee stability during and after rehabilitation in individuals with ACL injury. More specific aims were 1) to elaborate an evaluation method for muscle strength, 2) to evaluate the effect of exercises in closed and open kinetic chain, and 3) to evaluate dynamic knee stability in patients with ACL deficiency or ACL reconstruction. Sagittal tibial translation and knee flexion angle were measured using the CA‐ 4000 computerised goniometer linkage. Muscle activation was registered with electromyography. The intra‐ and inter‐rater reliability of 1 repetition maximum (RM) of <b>seated</b> knee <b>extension</b> was clinically acceptable. The inter‐rater reliability of 1 RM of squat was also acceptable, but the intra‐rater reliability was lower. The systematic procedure {{for the establishment of}} 1 RM that was developed can be recommended for use in the clinic. One specific exercise session including cycling and a maximum number of knee extensions and heel raises did not influence static or dynamic sagittal tibial translation in uninjured individuals. A comprehensive rehabilitation program with isolated quadriceps training in OKC led to significantly greater isokinetic quadriceps strength compared to CKC rehabilitation in patients with ACL deficiency. Hamstring strength, static and dynamic translation, and functional outcome were similar between groups. Five weeks after ACL reconstruction, <b>seated</b> knee <b>extension</b> produced more anterior tibial translation compared to the straight leg raise and standing on one leg. All exercises produced less or equal amount of anterior tibial translation as the 90 N Lachman test. Five weeks after the ACL reconstruction the static and dynamic tibial translation in the ACL reconstructed knee did not differ from the tibial translation on the uninjured leg. Patients in the early phase after ACL injury or ACL reconstruction used a joint stiffening strategy including a reduced peak knee extension angle during gait and increased hamstring activation during activity, which reduces the dynamic tibial translation. Patients with ACL deficiency that completed a four months rehabilitation program used a movement pattern that was more close to normal...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} quantify and compare Resultant Muscle Torque (RMT) pattern in quadriceps muscle using elastic resistance training device. Sixteen subjects completed 8 -RM <b>seated</b> knee <b>extension</b> by elastic tubing with original length (E 0) and elastic tubing with 30 % decrement of original length (E 30). Every repetition was partitioned into 6 phases (3 concentric and 3 eccentric) and mean value for external force and acceleration were calculated and synchronized for every phase of lifting. The magnitude of Resultant Muscle Torque was calculated based on the equation recommended by Enoka (2002) for dynamic motions. the RMT values among various exercise types phases demonstrated significantly higher value for E 30 compared with E 0 (all P < 0. 05). This is except in the 3 rd and 4 th phases of contraction which no significant difference observed between E 0 and E 30. Accordingly, the magnitude of increasing RMT in phase 1 (2. 6 %) and phase 6 (3. 98 %) for E 30 compared with E 0 % supported the effectiveness of two applied strategies in developing muscle torque production in ER exercises...|$|R

Construction of the Canadian aircraft was not so far advanced in 1957 and its builders chose to retain the original design fuselage but add slight rearward sweep to the outer wing leading edge, moving the center of pressure backwards. This aircraft lacked the spoilers but also the excess weight of the British aircraft, coming in close to the original design estimate.|$|R

Sixteen male and female subjects (22. 4 Â± 4. 7 yrs) completed 8 RM <b>seated</b> knee <b>extension</b> by NM, elastic tubing with original length (E 0) and elastic tubing with 30 decrement of original length (E 30). The mean value of EMG and external force were calculated and synchronized across various segments of motion for the three modes of training. The results demonstrated that in the early concentric and late eccentric segments of contraction, NM elicited significantly higher muscle activation than both E 30 and E 0 (p < 0. 05). However, in the mid-concentric and mid-eccentric as well as late concentric and early eccentric segments no significant differences were observed between NM and E 30. These findings supported the approach that developing external recoil of force in ER device by reducing 30 of initial length of elastic material can offer similar neuromuscular activation compared with NM. On this basis, E 30 can be suggested as an affordable and non-gym based exercise device which has the capacity to provide an appropriate high resistance stimulus to meet the training requirement of athletes.

40|$|This {{research}} is embarking on development of modelling and designing control strategies for a multi purpose wheelchair as a mobile transporter for {{elderly and disabled}} people to move in confined and domestic environments independently. The {{research is}} aimed at helping people who have physical weakness/disabilities in their upper and lower extremities to move on their own without human intervention. In this work, a novel reconfiguration which allows multi-task operations using the same wheelchair system with compact and simple mechanism is developed for use in confined domestic environment. It can perform manoeuvrability on flat surfaces, stairs climbing (ascending and descending), standing in the upright position on two wheels and transforms back to standard four wheels with reduced initial torque and reduced tilt angle. The wheelchair model is designed in Visual Nastran 4 D (VN 4 D) software with standard specifications of stairs dimension and size. A humanoid model with approximate weight of 71 kg is also developed in solid works and incorporated in VN 4 D to represent a disabled/elderly person. The wheelchair mechanism {{is based on the}} link/cluster rotation by lifting the other pair of wheels at the vertical upright position like an inverted pendulum. The completed model in VN 4 D is then integrated with Matlab/Simulink for control design and performance evaluation. The challenge resides in an appropriate design and implementation of robust controller for the system to guarantee stability of the overall wheelchair while performing multi-function tasks without falling over. A modular fuzzy logic control mechanism with integrated phases is introduced in this work for the two-wheeled stabilization as the main principle of the overall tasks.

Fatigue studies have demonstrated the effects of resistance exercise on neuromuscular activity; however, {{few studies have examined}} the effects of overtraining or overreaching on neuromuscular parameters. PURPOSE: To analyze the relationship between overreaching induced changes in performance and neuromuscular activity. METHODS: Eight resistance-trained men (n = 8; X ± SD; age = 22. 6 ± 2. 1 yrs) were assigned to the overreaching group {{as part of a larger}} study evaluating the effects of a nutritional supplement on overreaching. Following two weeks of resistance training twice per week, subjects trained twice per day for 7. 5 days, performing ten sets of five repetitions using 70 % 1 RM. Performance and neuromuscular measures were collected before (PRE) and after (POST) the 7. 5 day overreaching period. Performance measured included peak and average force during a back squat performed at the training load, as well as back squat one-repetition maximum. Neuromuscular activity was assessed via peak sEMG amplitude in the vastus lateralis during a <b>seated</b> leg <b>extension</b> isometric contraction performed with the knee positioned at a 90 ° angle. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients (r) were calculated to evaluate the relationship between performance and neuromuscular changes induced by the overreaching period. RESULTS: The relationship between PRE to POST changes in sEMG peak amplitude and peak force were significant at the p =. 05 level (r =. 804). Analysis of the relationship between changes in sEMG peak amplitude and average force yielded an r value of. 661, significant at the p =. 10 level. Similarly, the relationship between changes in the sEMG peak amplitude and 1 RM was significant at the p =. 10 level (r =. 627) CONCLUSION: The results of this investigation suggest that overreaching induced performance changes may, in part, be due to changes in neuromuscular activity. The observed changes in sEMG peak amplitude may to due to changes in motor unit recruitment or motor unit firing rates. Future investigations employing decomposition EMG (dEMG) may be able to further elucidate the effects of overreaching and overtraining on neuromuscular activity...|$|R
40|$|Knee {{replacement}} {{surgery is}} often performed {{in cases where}} the pain due to knee osteoarthritis can no longer be effectively controlled by conservative measures. The surgery—which replaces the articular surfaces of the tibia, femur and sometimes the patella with a mix of metal and polyethylene—is one of the most commonly performed lower limb surgeries. Despite patient reports of reduced pain and increased participation in activities of daily living, knee function following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) does not return to normal. Reductions in both passive and active knee range of motion, alterations in magnitude and timing of muscle activity, and changes in knee joint kinetics have all been reported. Comparatively little is known about why knee function is altered following TKA. In an attempt to address this gap in the literature, this thesis was designed to examine the biomechanical factors thought to contribute to reduced knee extensor moments following TKA. In particular, the contribution of alterations in passive knee moments, muscle moment arm lengths, and muscle activation magnitude and timing were examined in detail to determine which factors contributed to reduced knee extensor moment following TKA. To accomplish this goal, two groups [...] 6 healthy controls and 6 individuals who were at least one year post-TKA—were examined in four different studies. The initial study of this thesis, a comprehensive examination of patients and controls during gait and stepping onto a raised surface, had two purposes. This moment data was needed to clearly define the knee moment deficits that existed in the patient – the remainder of the thesis focused on determining why these specific deficits existed. A secondary aim of this first study was to allow for the assessment of muscle activation patterns in this population during weight bearing tasks. Results of study one confirmed the existence of knee extensor moment deficits in the TKA group and also demonstrated that patients exhibited increased gastrocnemius EMG, prolonged stance phase activation of biceps femoris and reduced knee flexion during the loading phase of stance. Analysis of results across the two tasks suggested that reduced knee moments in members of the TKA group may be related to changes in gastrocnemi activation, however, differences in knee joint kinematics between patients and controls made it difficult to draw this conclusion. Study number two was designed to further probe the muscle activation strategies adopted by members of the TKA group. In order to avoid complications involved when comparing muscle activation patterns between groups using different kinematic strategies, <b>seated</b> knee <b>extension</b> was examined. This task was chosen as it challenged the knee musculature {{while at the same time}} restricting both groups of participants to use the same knee joint kinematics. The results of this analysis revealed that, while EMG magnitude for quadriceps and hamstrings were similar for both groups, patients exhibited increased amplitude of EMG in both the medial and lateral gastrocnemi. While the first two studies of this thesis focused on the active knee joint moment, in the third study the force required to passively move the knee from a flexed to an extended position was measured and used to estimate the passive moment of the knee joint. This study was based on the rational that if the passive knee moment was altered following TKA it could potentially affect the net knee joint moment. The comparison of patient and control results showed that, while small changes in passive moment were evident in patients, these differences were not large enough to account for changes in the knee extensor moment. The goal of the final thesis study was to examine moment arms of the knee musculature in an attempt to determine if TKA resulted in changes to this variable. However, various methodological issues arose in the course of completing this study. As a result, limited data were produced that sufficiently addressed the question posed. Despite the problems that arose, important issues regarding in vivo moment arm determination were realized and are included for discussion in this thesis. Together, the four studies provided a unique opportunity to observe knee function over a range of activities. The following conclusions were reached. •	Changes in passive knee moment did not seem to contribute to reductions in knee extensor moment observed following TKA. •	Quadriceps and hamstring muscle function, as evidenced by EMG recording during the <b>seated</b> knee <b>extension</b> task, appeared intact following TKA, suggesting that alteration in the function of these muscles were not directly responsible for reductions in knee extensor moments. •	Changes in medial and lateral gastrocnemi activation were observed during knee extension and weight-bearing tasks. These changes may account for reduced knee extensor moment, particularly during the step-up task. •	Knee extensor moment reductions during gait appear to be related to the reduced knee flexion exhibited by patients during the stance phase of gait. It was hypothesized that these changes in knee kinematics were directly linked to the increased activation of the gastrocnemi during gait. Although low subject numbers limited the generalizability of the results these conclusions will serve to guide future research in this area and ultimately help improve function and quality of life in this patient population...|$|R
5000|$|The OHS has had {{multiple}} renovations and changes after the 1950s additions. The old gym, located behind the auditorium, was sectioned off into two rooms {{which became the}} band and orchestra rooms in the 1991 renovation. The original lunchroom was located under the north wing of the 1921 {{part of the building}} and is now used for storage of janitorial equipment and school records. Under the Auditorium lobby lies the old Auditorium Fan Room which holds two, large and old fans that were used to circulate air through the auditorium before the installation of air conditioners. The area is now used as miscellaneous storage. On the south wing of the 1921 part of the school in the basement where the wood and metal shops were, are now used as equipment and tool storage for school custodial maintenance staff. The basement area underneath the auditorium stage and old gym, contained the original locker rooms and the old pool, until the old gym was converted into classrooms and pool closed. Afterwards the Theatre department began using the space for storage. The original library was located on the second floor above the main doors and was switched to a classroom after the band and orchestra moved to their current rooms behind the auditorium in the late 1980s. The Auditorium has received many changes by itself with the removal of windows, stage extension, technicians booth <b>extension,</b> <b>seating</b> replacement, removal of catwalk, switch to counter weight fly system, light replacement, stage replacement, and curtain replacement.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of creatine supplementation and exercise on the integrity of muscle fiber, as well as the effect of the supplementation on the creatine kinase (CK) assay measurement. Forty-nine sedentary individuals participated in a double-blind study and were divided into two groups: C (n= 26) received 4 x 5 -day packages of 0. 6 g. kg- 1 of body weight contained 50 % of creatine + 50 % of dextrose, and P (n= 23) received packages containing only dextrose. On the first day the groups performed a 1 RM test for bench press, <b>seated</b> row, leg <b>extension,</b> leg curl and leg press. On D 7 they received the supplements. On the fourteenth day, they performed a training session of five exercises, each in three sets of ten repetitions at 75 % of 1 RM. Blood was collected before (D 14) and after the exercise session (D 15). Differing levels of blood creatine were tested to determine the influence on the assay measurements of CK. ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc tests were used to compare groups and different times of study protocol (P< 0. 05). No changes were observed in CK activity of the groups from D 0, D 7 and D 14. On D 15 CK activity increases 140 % (women) and 200 % (men). There was no difference in CK activity between groups. Blood creatine levels up to 5 mM produced no significant effect on CK assay results. CK activity increased after resistance exercise, while creatine supplementation produced no difference in the muscle cellular integrity nor compromised assay methodology...|$|R
40|$|Background: Although {{rehabilitation}} {{exercises are}} recommended in the nonoperative and postoperative treatment of biceps-related disorders and superior labrum anterior-posterior (SLAP) lesions in overhead athletes, a progressive exercise protocol with controlled low to moderate loads on the biceps {{has not yet}} been described. Purpose: To describe a continuum of exercises with progressive low to moderate loads on the biceps based on electromyographic (EMG) analysis. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study. Methods: Using surface electromyography, the EMG activity of 8 muscles (upper [UT], middle [MT], and lower [LT] trapezius; serratus anterior [SA]; anterior [AD] and posterior [PD] portions of the deltoid; and biceps [BB] and triceps [TB] brachii) was measured in 32 healthy participants performing 16 commonly described shoulder rehabilitation exercises. Results: Of the 16 exercises, 13 (side-lying shoulder forward flexion, prone <b>extension,</b> <b>seated</b> rowing, serratus punch, knee push-up plus, internal and external rotation both in 20 degrees and 90 degrees of abduction, forearm supination, uppercut, and internal and external rotation diagonal) showed low (50 % MVIC) EMG activity. Based on the results, a ranking was calculated of the exercises, with mean EMG levels between 2. 2 % +/- 1. 24 % (during internal rotation against resistance in 90 degrees of shoulder abduction) and 35. 9 % +/- 18. 82 % (during forward flexion in external rotation and supination) of MVIC. Conclusion: This study describes a continuum of exercises with an increasing level of EMG activity in the BB. Exercises targeting the trapezius resulted in less loads on the biceps compared with exercises for the SA. In addition, exercises with an internal rotation component showed low activity in the BB. In general, the exercises meant to target the BB showed the highest levels of activity in the BB...|$|R

O estudo teve como objetivo {{investigar}} os efeitos do treinamento de resistência de força com alto número de repetições no consumo máximo de oxigênio e limiar ventilatório em mulheres jovens. Participaram deste estudo 20 mulheres, com idade de 21, 2 ± 2, 7 anos, agrupadas em: I - grupo de treinamento de resistência de força com alto número de repetições (GT, n = 10) e II - controle (GC, n = 10). Todas as voluntárias foram submetidas ao seguinte protocolo: antropometria, teste cardiopulmonar em esteira rolante e testes de 1 RM nos exercícios: leg-press 45 º, cadeira extensora, mesa flexora, supino reto, puxador costas, desenvolvimento com a barra, rosca direta e tríceps com a barra. Os testes foram realizados antes e após 12 semanas. No período proposto, os grupos realizaram: I - GT: exercícios resistidos, os mesmos dos testes de 1 RM, com três séries de 25 repetições, com aproximadamente 30 % de 1 RM; II - GC: não realizou nenhum treinamento físico. Após 12 semanas, o GC não apresentou alterações nas variáveis estudadas (p > 0, 05). O GT apresentou aumento significante da massa magra (p 0, 05). Conclui-se que o treinamento de resistência de força com alto número de repetições proporcionou melhora da potência aeróbia das voluntárias, evidenciado pelo aumento do consumo máximo de oxigênio, embora não tenha modificado o limiar ventilatório.

30|$|Participants {{randomized}} to the EX condition {{participated in}} the exercise program {{for the duration of}} their chemotherapy starting one week after the first cycle of chemotherapy began until 3 weeks after the last cycle (approximately 4 cycles lasting a total 12 weeks). The exercise program consisted of an exercise routine with resistance bands that consisted of total body exercises three times per week with at least one day of rest between sessions. Exercises simulated traditional resistance exercises with free weights and included biceps curls, shoulder pull backs, <b>seated</b> rows, triceps <b>extensions,</b> chest press, leg extensions, hip flexion, hip abduction, hip adduction, heel raises, and chair squats. Resistance bands are portable, inexpensive, can be used for a variety of total body exercises, and have been used successfully with older populations (Egana et al. 2010) and in a recent trial of cancer survivors receiving high dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Hacker et al. 2011). One weekly exercise session with the resistance bands was completed under the supervision of an exercise trainer at the treating cancer center while the other two sessions per week were performed at the participant’s home with guidance from a guide booklet and DVD developed for the trial. Exercise sessions were not completed on days when chemotherapy was administered. The exercise routine consisted of warm-up exercises and stretches followed by 12 total body resistance exercises working major muscle groups for two sets of 15 repetitions. The full routine took approximately 30 minutes to complete. All exercises were chair based and developed from an existing program utilized for cardiac and pulmonary patients by an exercise physiologist. Participants were asked to maintain sufficient tension in the bands to find it challenging to complete the second set of repetitions. The UC condition continued with usual care and received a complimentary training session, guide booklet and DVD after completion of all post intervention measures.|$|R
50|$|Early in 2005, the Capitol Theater Foundation a 501c3 organization, {{bought the}} building, and began fund raising {{to buy the}} {{adjacent}} ISU building and to relight the marquee. After successfully raising funds the Capitol Theater's marquee was relit in December 2005 after decades of being dark. The Foundation engaged Metzger Johnson Architects of Burlington, Iowa to design {{a plan that would}} create a performing arts center by joining the Capitol Theater with the adjacent ISU building. After receiving an IJOBS grant for $1,000,000, historic tax credits and raising over a million dollars locally; planning began in 2010 for extensive renovations, which included all new seats, a new, larger stage, the use of the former ISU building as an annex for dressing rooms, restrooms, and loading of props, and backdrops, as well as an art gallery. The renovations on the building itself retained the original walls in the outer lobby, the exposed the original terrazzo floor, repainting the auditorium, installation of 370 new <b>seats,</b> a fifteen-foot <b>extension</b> of the stage, a new picture screen, state-of-the-art digital projection equipment, as well as a digital surround audio system, new lighting fixtures, and scrubbing of the outer facade of the building, at a cost of over three million dollars(US). New roofs were installed over both buildings The main entrance doors, which had been replaced with all glass doors in the 1970s were replaced with doors that replicated the original doors of 1937. The theater reopened June 1, 2012, and is available for rent. There are Sunday matinees taking place throughout the year. The idea of the remodeling, and renovations is to breathe new life into a fading downtown area. The projected revenue made for the downtown area on a reopened Capitol Theater is projected to be in the 4.25 million dollar range. The Capitol Theater Foundation owns all property associated with the two buildings, as well as all rights for scheduling events.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} whether variation in resistance exercise volume affects muscle function and physical performance response in older adults. Design: A randomized trial with subjects {{assigned to a}} single-set (1 -SET) or three-set (3 -SET) exercise group. Setting: An exercise facility at the University of Queensland. Participants: Twenty-eight community-dwelling men and women aged 65 to 78. Intervention: Progressive resistance training consisting of seven exercises targeting the major muscle groups of {{the upper and lower}} body performed on exercise machines twice weekly for 20 weeks at eight-repetition maximum (RM) intensity. Measurements: Muscle function included isotonic muscle strength (1 -RM) of the seven exercises, isokinetic and isometric knee extensor strength, and muscle endurance for the chest press and leg press exercises. Physical performance included timed chair rise, usual and fast 6 -m walk, 6 -m backwards walk, 400 m walk, ﬂoor rise to standing, and stair climbing ability. In addition, body composition was determined using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Results: Isotonic muscle strength increased in both exercise groups for all seven exercises (Po. 01), with the gain in the 3 -SET group greater (Po. 05) for the <b>seated</b> row, triceps <b>extension,</b> and knee extension (analysis of covariance). Similarly, muscle endurance gains were greater for the 3 -SET than the 1 -SET group (Po. 01), with no significant difference between groups for isokinetic and isometric knee extensor strength. Both groups improved (Po. 05) in the chair rise (1 -SET, 10. 1 %; 3 -SET, 13. 6 %), 6 -m backwards walk (1 -SET, 14. 3 %; 3 -SET, 14. 8 %), 400 -m walk (1 -SET, 3. 8 %; 3 -SET, 7. 4 %), and stair climbing test (1 -SET, 7. 7 %; 3 -SET, 6. 4 %), with the only difference between groups for the 400 -m walk (Po. 05). There was no difference between groups for change in body composition. Conclusion: Resistance training consisting of only single-set exercises is sufﬁcient to significantly enhance muscle function and physical performance, although muscle strength and endurance gains are greater with highervolume work. These ﬁndings have application in designing time-efﬁcient exercise regimens to enhance neuromuscular function in older adults. J Am Geriatr Soc 53 : 2090 – 2097, 2005...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Elderly people present {{alterations}} in body composition and physical fitness, compromising {{their quality of}} life. Chronic diseases, including HIV/AIDS, worsen this situation. Resistance exercises are prescribed to improve fitness and promote healthier and independent aging. Recovery of strength and physical fitness {{is the goal of}} exercise in AIDS wasting syndrome. OBJECTIVE: This study describes a case series of HIV-positive elderly patients who participated in a progressive resistance training program and evaluates their body composition, muscular strength, physical fitness and the evolution of CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) cell counts. METHODS: Subjects were prospectively recruited for nine months. the training program consisted of three sets of 8 - 12 repetitions of leg press, <b>seated</b> row, lumbar <b>extension</b> and chest press, performed with free weight machines hts, twice/week for one year. Infectious disease physicians followed patients and reported all relevant clinical data. Body composition was assessed by anthropometric measures and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry before and after the training program. RESULTS: Fourteen patients, aged 62 - 71 years old, of both genders, without regular physical activity who had an average of nine years of HIV/AIDS history were enrolled. the strengths of major muscle groups increased (74 %- 122 %, p= 0. 003 - 0. 021) with a corresponding improvement in sit-standing and walking 2. 4 m tests (p= 0. 003). There were no changes in clinical conditions and body composition measures, but triceps and thigh skinfolds were significantly reduced (p= 0. 037). in addition, there were significant increases in the CD 4 (+) counts (N= 151 cells; p= 0. 008) and the CD 4 (+) /CD 8 (+) ratio (0. 63 to 0. 81, p= 0. 009). CONCLUSION: Resistance training increased strength, improved physical fitness, reduced upper and lower limb skinfolds, and were associated with an improvement in the CD 4 (+) and CD 4 (+) /CD 8 (+) counts in HIV positive elderly patients without significant side effects.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the accuracy of eleven prediction equations and one prediction table when estimating isoinertial knee extension and leg press one repetition maximum (1 -RM) performance in subjects with knee injuries and knee osteoarthritis. Study Design: A descriptive quantitative research study was undertaken utilizing a cross-sectional design. Background: Traumatic injuries and osteoarthritis are common musculoskeletal pathologies that can disrupt normal function of the knee joint. A frequent sequela of these pathologies is quadriceps femoris muscle weakness. Such weakness can contribute to disability and diminished levels of functional and recreational activity. Therefore, safe and accurate methods of measuring maximal strength are required to identify and quantify quadriceps strength deficits. One option proposed in the literature is the use of 1 -RM prediction equations which estimate 1 -RM performance from the number of repetitions completed with sub-maximal loads. These equations have been investigated previously using healthy populations and subjects with calf muscle injuries. However, to date, no known study has investigated their accuracy in individuals with joint pathologies. Method: Machine-weight <b>seated</b> knee <b>extension</b> and <b>seated</b> leg press exercises were investigated in this study. Twenty subjects with knee injuries and 12 subjects with knee OA completed the testing procedures for the knee extension exercise. Nineteen subjects with knee injuries and 18 subjects with knee OA completed the testing procedures for the leg press exercise. All subjects attended the testing venue on three occasions. At the first visit a familiarization session was carried out. At the second and third visits each subject was randomly assigned to perform either actual or predicted 1 -RM testing for both of the exercises. Twelve different prediction methods were used to estimate 1 -RM performance from the results. The estimates of 1 -RM strength were then compared to actual 1 -RM performance to assess the level of conformity between these measures. Statistical procedures including Bland and Altman analyses, intraclass correlation coefficients, typical error and total error of measurement were used in the analyses of the results. In addition, paired t-tests were performed to determine whether actual 1 -RM values were significantly different across the control and affected limbs and whether there were any significant differences in predictive accuracy for each equation across the control and affected limbs. Finally, the number of subjects with predicted 1 -RM values within 5 % or less of their actual 1 -RM values was determined for each equation. Results: When the knee injury group performed the knee extension exercise, the Brown, Brzycki, Epley, Lander, Mayhew et al., Poliquin and Wathen prediction methods demonstrated the greatest levels of predictive accuracy. When two atypical subjects were identified and excluded from the analyses, the accuracy of these equations improved further. Following the removal of these two subjects, no significant differences in predictive accuracy were found for any of the equations across the affected and control limbs (p > 0. 05). Typical errors and total errors were low for the more accurate prediction methods ranging from 2. 4 - 2. 8 % and from 2. 4 - 3. 5 %, respectively. Overall, the Poliquin table appeared to be the most accurate prediction method for this sample (affected limbs: bias 0. 3 kg, 95 % limits of agreement (LOA) - 5. 8 to 6. 4 kg, typical error as a coefficient of variation (COV) 2. 4 %, total error of measurement (total error) 2. 4 %; control limbs: bias - 1. 3 kg, 95 % LOA - 9. 0 to 6. 3 kg, typical error as a COV 2. 7 %, total error 2. 8 %). When the knee OA group performed the knee extension exercise, the Brown, Brzycki, Epley, Lander, Mayhew et al., Poliquin and Wathen prediction methods demonstrated the greatest levels of predictive accuracy. No significant differences in predictive accuracy were found for any of the equations across the affected and control limbs (p > 0. 05). When an atypical subject was identified and excluded from the analyses, the accuracy of the equations improved further. Typical errors as COVs and total errors for the more accurate prediction methods ranged from 2. 5 - 2. 7 % and from 2. 4 - 2. 9 %, respectively. Overall, the Poliquin table appeared to be the most accurate prediction method for this sample (affected limbs: bias 0. 9 kg, 95 % LOA - 4. 5 to 6. 3 kg, typical error as a COV 2. 5 %, total error 2. 5 %; control limbs: bias - 0. 1 kg, 95 % LOA - 6. 0 to 5. 9 kg, typical error as a COV 2. 5 %, total error 2. 4 %). When the knee injury group performed the leg press, the Adams, Berger, Lombardi and O’Connor equations demonstrated the greatest levels of predictive accuracy. No significant differences in predictive accuracy were found for any of the equations across the affected and control limbs (p > 0. 05). Typical errors as COVs and total errors for the more accurate equations ranged from 2. 8 - 3. 2 % and from 2. 9 - 3. 3 %, respectively. Overall, the Berger (affected limbs: bias - 0. 4 kg, 95 % LOA - 7. 2 to 6. 3 kg, typical error as a COV 3. 2 %, total error 3. 2 %; control limbs: bias 0. 1 kg, 95 % LOA - 6. 6 to 6. 7 kg, typical error as a COV 3. 1 %, total error 3. 0 %) and O’Connor equations (affected limbs: bias - 0. 6 kg, 95 % LOA- 6. 8 to 5. 7 kg, typical error as a COV 2. 9 %, total error 3. 0 %; control limbs: bias - 0. 2 kg, 95 % LOA - 6. 9 to 6. 4 kg, typical error as a COV 2. 9 %, total error 2. 9 %) appeared to be the most accurate prediction methods for this sample. When the knee OA group performed the leg press, the Adams, Berger, KLW, Lombardi and O’Connor equations demonstrated the greatest levels of predictive accuracy. No significant differences in predictive accuracy were found for any of the equations across the affected and control limbs (p > 0. 05). The typical errors as COVs and the total error values for the more accurate prediction methods were the highest observed in this study, ranging from 5. 8 - 6. 0 % and from 5. 7 - 6. 2 %, respectively. Overall, the Adams, Berger, KLW and O’Connor equations appeared to be the most accurate prediction methods for this sample. However, it is possible that the predicted leg press 1 -RM values produced by the knee OA group might not have matched actual 1 -RM values closely enough to be clinically acceptable for some purposes. Conclusion: The findings of the current study suggested that the Poliquin table produced the most accurate estimates of knee extension 1 -RM performance for both the knee injury and knee OA groups. In contrast, the Berger and O’Connor equations produced the most accurate estimates of leg press 1 -RM performance for the knee injury group, while the Adams, Berger, KLW and O’Connor equations produced the most accurate results for the knee OA group. However, the higher error values observed for the knee OA group suggested that predicted leg press 1 -RM performance might not be accurate enough for some clinical purposes. Finally, it can be concluded that no single prediction equation was able to accurately estimate both knee extension and leg press 1 -RM performance in subjects with knee injuries and knee OA...|$|R
