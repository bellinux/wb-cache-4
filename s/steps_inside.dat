5|$|The {{next day}} at the tavern, Morrison meets Brown's wife (Agi Szirtes), and tells her that Brown is under {{suspicion}} for the theft and for the murder at the quayside. He asks for her help in finding him and repeats to her Mitchell's offer to Brown, but she remains silent. At home, Henriette tells Maloin she found a man in their hut at the seaside, and in fear locked the door and ran home. An agitated Maloin tells her not to tell anyone, and leaves for the hut. He unlocks the door, and receiving no response to his calling Brown's name, <b>steps</b> <b>inside,</b> closing the door behind. Minutes later he re-emerges, breathing heavily. After pausing to compose himself, he locks the door and leaves. In the next scene, Maloin presents the briefcase to Morrison in the tavern, and asks him to arrest him, confessing to having killed Brown an hour ago. Morrison leaves with Maloin for the hut, dismissing the frenzied inquiries of Brown's wife about her husband and handing the briefcase to the barkeep on the way out. Brown's wife follows the men to the hut, and emerges weeping with Morrison moments later. Back at the tavern, Morrison prepares two envelopes with {{a small portion of}} the recovered money in each. One he leaves with the grieving widow to whom he apologizes and wishes well, while the other he gives to Maloin, telling him that his case was one of self-defense. As he is preparing to leave, Morrison advises Maloin to go home and forget the whole affair. The camera focuses on the expressionless face of Brown's wife momentarily before fading to white.|$|E
2500|$|Cave 22 {{is a small}} vihara (12.72 X 11.58 m) with {{a narrow}} veranda and four {{unfinished}} cells. It is excavated {{at a higher level}} and has to be reached by a flight of <b>steps.</b> <b>Inside,</b> the Buddha is seated in pralamba-padasana. The painted figures in Cave 22 show Manushi-Buddhas with Maitreya. A pilaster {{on the left side of}} the Cave 22 veranda has a Sanskrit prose inscription. It is damaged in parts, and the legible parts state that this is a [...] "meritorious gift of a mandapa by Jayata", calling Jayata's family as [...] "a great Upasaka", and ending the inscription with [...] "may the merit of this be for excellent knowledge to all sentient beings, beginning with father and mother".|$|E
2500|$|A 0.75-mile (1.1-km) hike {{leads to}} the edge of the crater's rim. Signs at the trailhead say that the hike takes 1.5–2 hours round-trip, and {{recommends}} that hikers bring water. Although not difficult, the signs also say that the hike is not a casual one: the mostly unpaved trail winds over uneven rock, ascends 74 steps, then through a tunnel and up another steep 99 steps. Next is a small lighted tunnel to a narrow spiral staircase (43 <b>steps)</b> <b>inside</b> a coastal artillery observation platform built in 1908. From the summit above the observation platform both Waikīkī and the Pacific Ocean can be seen in detail. It is a short but steep hike – it is a 170 m (560ft) elevation gain for a total elevation of 232 m (762ft). There is a water fountain near the bathrooms at the foot of the trail in case you want to hydrate before the hike or fill an empty bottle. The park closes at 6:00 pm and signs posted indicate that you are not allowed to head up the trail after 4:30 pm. [...] A downloadable certificate is available to those who complete the climb.|$|E

2500|$|God in [...] "The Ancient of Days" [...] is a [...] "nous" [...] figure, a {{creative}} principle {{in the universe}} that establishes mathematical order and permanence that allows life to keep from becoming nothingness. In such a view, Jesus {{is seen as a}} Logos figure that is disconnected from the nous in that Logos constantly recreates what is beautiful. As such, Jesus, as well as the Holy Spirit, are connected in Blake's mythology to the image of the universal man as opposed to God the Father. The image is also connected to John Milton's Paradise Lost in which God uses a golden compass to circumscribe the universe. Blake's version does not create Eden but instead is creating the serpent of the poem's frontispiece. The image is also connected to a vision Blake witnessed at the <b>steps</b> <b>inside</b> of his home. There are parallels between the actions of women within Europe and the 1820s images titled Drawings for The Book of Enoch. The latter work describes the seduction of the Watchers of Heaven by the Daughters of Men; giants born of their union then proceed to ravage the land. Both works emphasise the dominance of women.|$|E

60|$|Glancing up {{the alley}} beyond {{the figures of}} two policemen who had arrived and were holding the people back, I saw {{the hood of the}} {{conveyance}} as it came to a halt, and immediately a hospital doctor and two assistants carrying a stretcher hurried towards us, and we made way for them to enter. After a brief interval, they were heard coming slowly down the <b>steps</b> <b>inside.</b> By the white, cruel light of the arc I saw Krebs lying motionless.... I laid hold of {{one of the men who}} had been on the platform. He did not resent the act, he seemed to anticipate my question.|$|E

We would all gather {{together}} and in about two minutes would be having a good time--playing cards or dancing. [...] . We used to waltz and dance contra dances. None of these new jigs and not wear any clothes to speak of. We covered our hides in those days; no tight skirts like now. You could take three or four <b>steps</b> <b>inside</b> our skirts and then not reach the edge. One of the boys would fiddle {{a while and then}} some one would spell him and he could get a dance. Sometimes they would dance and fiddle too." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{had been}} built in the Tuscan order of classic architecture, and was really a tower, being hollow with <b>steps</b> <b>inside.</b> The gloom and {{solitude}} which prevailed round the base were remarkable. The sob of the environing trees was here expressively manifest; and moved by the light breeze their thin straight stems rocked in seconds, like inverted pendulums; while some boughs and twigs rubbed the pillar's sides, or occasionally clicked in catching each other. Below the level of their summits the masonry was lichen-stained and mildewed, for the sun never pierced that moaning cloud of blue-black vegetation. Pads of moss grew in the joints of the stone-work, and here and there shade-loving insects had engraved on the mortar patterns of no human style or meaning; but curious and suggestive. Above the trees the case was different: the pillar rose into the sky a bright and cheerful thing, unimpeded, clean, and flushed with the sunlight.|$|E
