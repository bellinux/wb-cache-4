40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore {{foundation}} phase teachers' perceptions of the way in which supportive school environments are being created for children from <b>same-sex</b> <b>parented</b> <b>families.</b> It focused specifically on how foundation phase teachers perceive their role in accommodating, including, and positively representing the <b>same-sex</b> <b>parented</b> <b>family</b> in their classroom practice. Current literature highlights the negative experiences of homophobia and heteronormativity in schools, together with the need to create more supportive school environments for children from samesex <b>parented</b> <b>families.</b> The increasing prevalence of <b>same-sex</b> <b>parented</b> <b>families</b> in South Africa has created the need for extended research in this regard, and yet there is a gap in national literature on the school experiences of children from this nontraditional minority family form. Foundation phase teachers play a central role in teaching their young learners to accept and celebrate diversity. However, no research has been done in South Africa to explore foundation phase teachers' perspectives on their role in interrupting heteronormativity in their schools and classrooms. This study was approached from an interpretive paradigm and qualitative methods were employed to collect and analyse the data. Individual interviews were conducted with four foundation phase teachers, and interpretive thematic data analysis techniques were used to analyse the data. Culturally responsive pedagogy was used as a framework to explore barriers to inclusion, and to recommend ways in which foundation phase teachers in South African schools can be supported in creating safe, positive and counter-heteronormative school environments for children from <b>same-sex</b> <b>parented</b> <b>families.</b> Dissertation (MEd) [...] University of Pretoria, 2017.

40|$|This paper {{reviews and}} synthesises Australian and {{international}} literature on <b>same-sex</b> <b>parented</b> <b>families.</b> Introduction: This research paper reviews and synthesises Australian and international literature on <b>same-sex</b> <b>parented</b> <b>families.</b> It includes {{discussion of the}} different modes of conception or family formation, different family structures, and {{the small number of}} studies on bisexual and transgender parents. Particular attention is paid to research on the emotional, social and educational outcomes for children raised by lesbian and gay parents, and the methodological strengths and weaknesses of this body of work. Key Messages: About 11 % of Australian gay men and 33 % of lesbians have children. Children may have been conceived in the context of previous heterosexual relationships, or raised from birth by a co-parenting gay or lesbian couple or single parent. Overall, research to date considerably challenges the point of view that <b>same-sex</b> <b>parented</b> <b>families</b> are harmful to children. Children in such families do as well emotionally, socially and educationally as their peers from heterosexual couple families. Some researchers have concluded there are benefits for children raised by lesbian couples in that they experience higher quality parenting, sons display greater gender flexibility, and sons and daughter display more open-mindedness towards sexual, gender and family diversity. The possible effect of important socio-economic family factors, such as income and parental education, were not always considered in the studies reviewed in this paper. Although many Australian lesbian-parented families appear to be receiving good support from their health care providers, there is evidence that more could be done to develop policies and practices supportive of <b>same-sex</b> <b>parented</b> <b>families</b> in the Australian health, education, child protection and foster care systems.

This study compares 60 gay parents, 125 lesbian parents, and 160 heterosexual parents matched on their children’s demographic characteristics (Mage = 3. 6, SDage = 2. 5; girls = 51 %). The Coparenting Scale-Revised (McHale, 1999) was used to assess the Integrity and Conflict dimension of the <b>family.</b> The <b>Parent</b> Self-Agency Measure (Dumka et al., 2002) was used to measure the perceived parenting self-efficacy. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (Goodman 2001) was used to evaluate the psychosocial outcomes of the children. To assess differences between heterosexual, gay, and lesbian parents (household type) on parenting dimensions and children’s general health and prosocial behavior, two 2 X 3 MANOVAs were conducted, with household type and child gender as independent factors. Only a significant main effect of household type was found on the parenting dimensions; Wilks’s λ =. 91, F(3, 318) = 5. 21, p <. 001. Follow-up ANOVAs revealed that heterosexual parents reported higher level of conflict than gay and lesbian parents, and gay parents reported more self-efficacy than heterosexual and lesbian parents. A significant main effect for child outcome variables was found based on household type, Wilks’s λ =. 94, F(5, 345) = 1. 97, p =. 03, and child gender, Wilks’s λ =. 95, F(5, 345) = 3. 72, p <. 001, although the interaction was not significant.

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 and the Civil Partnership Act 2005, many lesbian and gay couples have started families through adoption; yet, to date, research on <b>same-sex</b> <b>parent</b> <b>families</b> has almost exclusively focused on families in which children were conceived through a heterosexual relationship or assisted reproduction. What is more, despite a large body of evidence regarding lesbian mother families, there have been few studies of children’s adjustment when raised by gay fathers. The circumstances of gay father families are more unusual than lesbian mother families; not only are the <b>parents</b> <b>same-sex,</b> but it is also rare for fathers, be they heterosexual or gay, to be the primary caregivers.

40|$|Abstract Background There are an {{increasing}} number of children in Australia growing up with <b>same-sex</b> attracted <b>parents.</b> Although children from <b>same-sex</b> <b>parent</b> <b>families</b> do in general perform well on many psychosocial measures recent research is beginning to consider some small but significant differences when these children are compared with children from other family backgrounds. In particular studies suggest that there is an association between the stigma that <b>same-sex</b> <b>parent</b> <b>families</b> experience and child wellbeing. Research to date lacks a holistic view with the complete physical, mental and social wellbeing of children not yet addressed. In addition, most studies have focused only on <b>families</b> with lesbian <b>parents</b> and have studied only small numbers of children. Methods/design The Australian Study of Child Health in Same-Sex Families (ACHESS) is a national study that aims to determine the complete physical, mental and social wellbeing of Australian children under the age 18 [*]years with at least one parent who self identifies as being same-sex attracted. There will be a particular focus on the impact that stigma and discrimination has on these <b>families.</b> <b>Parent</b> and child surveys will be used to collect data and will be available both online and in paper form. Measures have been chosen whenever possible that have sound conceptual underpinnings, robust psychometric properties and Australian normative data, and include the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ), the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K 10). Discussion ACHESS aims to be the largest study of its kind and will for the first time produce a detailed quantitative analysis of Australian children with <b>same-sex</b> attracted <b>parents.</b> By inviting participants to take part in further research it will also establish a valuable cohort of children, and their families, to launch future waves of research that will help us better understand the health and wellbeing of children with <b>same-sex</b> attracted <b>parents.</b> </p...|$|R

This paper presents findings from an Australian qualitative study of separated <b>same-sex</b> <b>parents</b> and explores their experiences with professionals and service providers during and after their separation. As a consequence of their separation, <b>same-sex</b> <b>parents</b> encountered new service providers with whom they had to navigate relationships with; this paper will focus on their experiences with the legal profession, mediation services, counseling, and mental health services. Findings demonstrated ongoing challenges for parents in finding service providers who they believed could meet and/or understand their specific needs. Heteronormativitiy, whether experienced or perceived, often created an added layer of marginalization for <b>same-sex</b> <b>parents</b> as they navigated the already difficult terrain of separation. Consequently, some parents did not access service providers and missed out on the help that they needed during their separation. Those that did visit professionals and service providers reported mixed experiences, with some participants describing encounters fraught with difficulty, while for others, their experiences were much better than they had anticipated. While some participants had a preference for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex (LGBTI) specific service providers, some discovered a lack of understanding among LGBTI providers towards separating parents or non-biological mothers.

In order to do so, five Italian and five Norwegian couples of <b>same-sex</b> <b>parents</b> have been recruited to conduct semi-structured interviews in the cities of Oslo and Turin, which are similar in terms of population. For each country, four female and one male couples have been selected using the purposive sampling method.

40|$|Introduction: The {{efforts to}} capture the {{complexity}} of family relationships and their influences on family members {{have led to a}} variety of assessment strategies, without, however, a multi-method approach. Additionally, research have began to converge on the results that lesbians and gays’ parental experiences and competencies are similar than those of heterosexual couples. Nevertheless, very few studies have changed their epistemological background focusing on the specific sources of strength and resilience among <b>same-sex</b> <b>parent</b> <b>families.</b> Aims of the work: The aim of this work is to study coparenting, family alliance, parental stress and child’s adjustment in <b>families</b> with lesbian <b>parents</b> and to individuate variables that discriminate between functional and dysfunctional family interactions in clinical and non-clinical contexts. Description of the work: We present two contrasted cases between one lesbian couple who sought a clinical consultation for the child’s symptoms and the other who participated in the study voluntarily. The research procedure was multi-method and used both self-report measures and observation. The quality of triadic family interactions was explored with the postnatal Lausanne Trilogue Play, co-parenting was assessed with the Co-parenting Scale-revised and the magnitude of stress in the parent-child system was evaluated with the Parenting Stress Index. Finally, children’s adjustment was evaluated with the Strenghts and Difficulties Questionnaire (parent version). Conclusions: Contrasted cases show the usefulness of integrating research findings into clinically relevant methods because they allow to examine family processes on both a representative and practicing level. Considering simultaneously gender, sexual orientation and parental status, the study of <b>same-sex</b> <b>parents</b> would open new theoretical, methodological and practical perspectives...|$|R
5000|$|Scientific {{research}} that has directly compared outcomes for children with gay and lesbian parents with outcomes for children with heterosexual parents has found that children raised by same-sex couples are as physically or psychologically healthy, capable, and successful as those raised by opposite-sex couples, despite the reality that considerable legal discrimination and inequity remain significant challenges for these families. Major associations of mental health professionals in the U.S., Canada, and Australia, have not identified credible empirical {{research that}} suggests otherwise. Sociologist Wendy Manning echoes their conclusion that [...] "The studies reveal that children raised in <b>same-sex</b> <b>parent</b> <b>families</b> fare {{just as well as}} children raised in different-sex <b>parent</b> <b>families</b> across a wide spectrum of child well-being measures: academic performance, cognitive development, social development, psychological health, early sexual activity, and substance abuse." [...] The range of these studies allows for conclusions to be drawn beyond any narrow spectrum of a child's well being, and the literature further indicates that parents' financial, psychological and physical well-being is enhanced by marriage and that children benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally recognized union. There is evidence that nuclear <b>families</b> with homosexual <b>parents</b> are more egalitarian in their distribution of home and childcare activities, and thus less likely to embrace traditional gender roles. Nonetheless, the American Academy of Pediatrics reports that there are no differences in the interests and hobbies between children with homosexual versus heterosexual parents.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background While {{families}} {{headed by}} same-sex couples have achieved greater public visibility in recent years, {{there are still}} many challenges for these families in dealing with legal and community contexts that are not supportive of same-sex relationships. The Work, Love, Play study is a large longitudinal study of <b>same-sex</b> <b>parents.</b> It aims to investigate many facets of family life among this sample and examine how they change over time. The study focuses specifically on two key areas missing from the current literature: factors supporting resilience in <b>same-sex</b> <b>parented</b> families; and health and wellbeing outcomes for same-sex couples who undergo separation, including the negotiation of shared parenting arrangements post-separation. The current paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the design and methods of this longitudinal study and discuss its significance. Methods/Design The Work, Love, Play study is a mixed design, three wave, longitudinal cohort study of <b>same-sex</b> attracted <b>parents.</b> The sample includes lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender parents in Australia and New Zealand (including single parents within these categories) caring for any {{children under the age of}} 18 years. The study will be conducted over six years from 2008 to 2014. Quantitative data are to be collected via three on-line surveys in 2008, 2010 and 2012 from the cohort of parents recruited in Wave 1. Qualitative data will be collected via interviews with purposively selected subsamples in 2012 and 2013. Data collection began in 2008 and 355 respondents to Wave One of the study have agreed to participate in future surveys. Work is currently underway to increase this sample size. The methods and survey instruments are described. Discussion This study will make an important contribution to the existing research on <b>same-sex</b> <b>parented</b> <b>families.</b> Strengths of the study design include the longitudinal method, which will allow understanding of changes over time within internal family relationships and social supports. Further, the mixed method design enables triangulation of qualitative and quantitative data. A broad recruitment strategy has already enabled a large sample size with the inclusion of both gay men and lesbians. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} a {{critical}} discourse analysis of kindergarten programmatic curricula across Canada. The prime goal {{of the study was}} to produce knowledge of programmatic curricula’s treatment of diverse gender and sexual identities. The research questions investigated what gender and sexual identities are included in the curricula, how these identities are configured, the meaning making opportunities children are thereby offered, and the implications for students’ gender and sexual identity options and their understandings of gender and sexual minority youth and <b>same-sex</b> <b>parented</b> <b>families.</b> The data collection tool drew upon Fairclough’s (1995) textual analysis (including linguistic and intertextual components), Dillon’s (2009) questions of curriculum (modified to explore the nature, elements, and practice of gender and sexual identities), and the six dimensions of language arts (reading, writing, listening, speaking, viewing, and representing). Findings indicate that most of the examined curricula lacked explicit language to specify what gender and sexual identities should be included in classroom curricula. Null and hidden curricula were identified that reinforce traditional gender identities and could limit identity options for children. Developmentally Appropriate Practice (DAP) figured prominently in the curricula and placed constraints on classroom curricula relative to diverse gender and sexual identities. Recommendations include changes to programmatic curricula to be more specific regarding identities to include in teaching, how to resolve conflict over differences, and that programmatic curricula move beyond narrow perspectives of DAP. Educator professional learning is required to support all recommendations...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to write a children’s book {{featuring}} same-sex and interracial families for children to both see themselves represented {{as well as to}} expose others to diverse, and increasingly common, family types. The creation of the book was guided by an analysis of the books available at an urban and rural Oregon library system. The book is supported by a literature review on the impacts of <b>same-sex</b> <b>parents,</b> interracial <b>families,</b> and <b>same-sex</b> interracial families on children. In addition, the book is informed by three theoretical frameworks: socioemotional literacy framework, gender schema theory, and critical race theory. The book is aimed at children aged 3 to 7 years old because that is the time period when socioemotional development builds a foundation for understanding, which guides empathy {{for the rest of the}} lifespan...|$|R
40|$|A família nuclear heterossexual tem como marca a atribuição das funções materna/paterna aliada ao sexo dos cuidadores. Arranjos {{familiar}}es diferentes são vistos como exceção e considerados como fonte de psicopatologias. Embora haja predomínio das famílias heteroparentais, elas hoje dividem espaço com novas configurações, como as famílias homoparentais. O presente ensaio buscou compreender, por meio do método de estudo de caso, como se dá o desempenho da função materna em uma família homoparental feminina, composta pelas parceiras e pelo filho biológico de uma delas. Foi realizada uma entrevista com o casal em separado e aplicação de desenho da família com estórias. Com a criança, realizou-se uma sessão lúdica. Também houve uma entrevista familiar diagnóstica com o casal e a criança, e uma devolutiva. O material foi interpretado pelo referencial psicanalítico. Observou-se que a maternagem foi, em grande parte, desempenhada pela parceira e não pela mãe biológica. In {{families with}} a heterosexually-based core, maternal and paternal functions {{are associated with}} the gender of the care-givers. Families of non-traditional orientation are usually seen as a source of psychopathologies. Even though the conventional, traditional arrangement is still prevalent, this arrangement has come to share its space and importance with new and questioning family configurations, among which one may quote <b>same-sex</b> <b>parents.</b> The present essay has attempted to understand, by way of case studies, the performance of the maternal function in a female <b>same-sex</b> <b>parenting</b> <b>family,</b> composed of a female couple in the role of parents and the biological child of one of them. For the purpose of this analysis, an interview was conducted with the couple, separately, followed by the use of the family drawing test. A game was devised to test the child. There was also a diagnostic family interview with the couple and with child, with feedback. The material was interpreted on the basis of psychoanalytical reference. It was observed that the maternal function was largely conducted by the other partner and not by the biological mother...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that children with <b>same-sex</b> attracted <b>parents</b> score well in psychosocial aspects of their health, however questions remain about the impact of stigma on these children. Research to date has focused on lesbian parents and has been limited by small sample sizes. This study aims to describe the physical, mental and social wellbeing of Australian children with <b>same-sex</b> attracted <b>parents,</b> and the impact that stigma has on them. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey, the Australian Study of Child Health in Same-Sex Families, was distributed in 2012 to a convenience sample of 390 parents from Australia who self-identified as same-sex attracted and had children aged 0 - 17 years. Parent-reported, multidimensional measures of child health and wellbeing and the relationship to perceived stigma were measured. RESULTS: 315 parents completed the survey (completion rate[*]=[*] 81 %) representing 500 children. 80 % of children had a female index parent while 18 % had a male index <b>parent.</b> Children in <b>same-sex</b> <b>parent</b> <b>families</b> had higher scores on measures of general behavior, general health and family cohesion compared to population normative data (β[*]=[*] 2. 93, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 35 to 5. 52, P[*]=[*]. 03; β[*]=[*] 5. 60, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 2. 69 to 8. 52, P[*]=[*]<. 001; and β[*]=[*] 6. 01, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 2. 84 to 9. 17, P[*]=[*]<. 001 respectively). There {{were no significant differences between}} the two groups for all other scale scores. Physical activity, mental health, and family cohesion were all negatively associated with increased stigma (β[*]=[*]- 3. 03, 95 % CI[*]=[*]- 5. 86 to - 0. 21, P[*]=[*]. 04; β[*]=[*]- 10. 45, 95 % CI[*]=[*]- 18. 48 to - 2. 42, P[*]=[*]. 01; and β[*]=[*]- 9. 82, 95 % CI[*]=[*]- 17. 86 to - 1. 78, P[*]=[*]. 02 respectively) and the presence of emotional symptoms was positively associated with increased stigma (β = 0. 94, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 08 to 1. 81, P[*]=[*]. 03). CONCLUSIONS: Australian children with <b>same-sex</b> attracted <b>parents</b> score higher than population samples on a number of parent-reported measures of child health. Perceived stigma is negatively associated with mental health. Through improved awareness of stigma these findings play an important role in health policy, improving child health outcomes.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} Kinsey self-ratings and lifetime {{sexual experiences}} of 17 -year-olds whose lesbian mothers enrolled before these offspring {{were born in}} the longest-running, prospective study of <b>same-sex</b> <b>parented</b> <b>families,</b> with a 93 % retention rate to date. Data for the current report were gathered through online questionnaires completed by 78 adolescent offspring (39 girls and 39 boys). The adolescents were asked if they had ever been abused and, if so, to specify by whom and the type of abuse (verbal, emotional, physical, or sexual). They were also asked to specify their sexual identity on the Kinsey scale, between exclusively heterosexual and exclusively homosexual. Lifetime sexual behavior was assessed through questions about heterosexual and same-sex contact, age of first sexual experience, contraception use, and pregnancy. The results revealed that there were no reports of physical or sexual victimization by a parent or other caregiver. Regarding sexual orientation, 18. 9 % of the adolescent girls and 2. 7 % of the adolescent boys self-rated in the bisexual spectrum, and 0 % of girls and 5. 4 % of boys self-rated as predominantly-to-exclusively homosexual. When compared with age- and gender-matched adolescents of the National Survey of Family Growth, the study offspring were significantly older {{at the time of their}} first heterosexual contact, and the daughters of lesbian mothers were significantly more likely to have had same-sex contact. These findings suggest that adolescents reared in lesbian families are less likely than their peers to be victimized by a parent or other caregiver, and that daughters of lesbian mothers are more likely to engage in same-sex behavior and to identify as bisexual...|$|R
