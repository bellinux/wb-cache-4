60|$|In {{descending}} {{the eastern}} slope {{of this great}} central range, the strata, which in the upper part dip eastward at about an angle of 40 degrees, {{become more and more}} curved, till they are nearly vertical; and a little further onwards there is seen on the further side of a ravine, a thick mass of strata of bright red sandstone [T], with their upper extremities slightly curved, showing that they were once conformably prolonged over the beds [S]: on the southern and opposite side of the road, this red sandstone and the underlying black shaly rocks stand vertical, and in actual juxtaposition. Continuing to descend, we come to a <b>synclinal</b> <b>valley</b> filled with rubbish, beyond which we have the red sandstone [T2] corresponding with [T], and now dipping, as is seen both north and south of the road, at 45 degrees to the west; and under it, the beds [S2, R2, Q2, and I believe P2] in corresponding order and of similar composition, with those on the western flank of the Pequenes range, but dipping westward. Close to the <b>synclinal</b> <b>valley</b> the dip of these strata is 45 degrees, but at the eastern or farther end of the series it increases to 60 degrees. Here the great gypseous formation abruptly terminates, and is succeeded eastward by a pile of more modern strata. Considering how violently these central ranges have been dislocated, and how very numerous dikes are in the exterior and lower parts of the Cordillera, it is remarkable that I did not here notice a single dike. The prevailing rock in this neighbourhood is the black, calcareous, compact shale, whilst in the valley-basin of the Yeso the purplish red sandstone or mudstone predominates,--both being associated with gypseous strata of exactly the same nature. It {{would be very difficult to}} ascertain the relative superposition of these several masses, for we shall afterwards see in the Cumbre Pass that the gypseous and intercalated beds are lens-shaped, and that they thin out, even where very thick, and disappear in short horizontal distances: it is quite possible that the black shales and red sandstones may be contemporaneous, but it is more probable that the former compose the uppermost parts of the series.|$|E
50|$|Simi Valley is a <b>synclinal</b> <b>valley</b> in Southern California in the United States. It is an {{enclosed}} or hidden valley surrounded by mountains and hills. It {{is connected to}} the San Fernando Valley to the east by the Santa Susana Pass & 118 freeway, and in the west the narrows of the Arroyo Simi and 118 freeway connect to Moorpark and Ventura, California. The relatively flat bottom of the valley contains soils formed from shales, sandstones and conglomerates eroded from the surrounding hills of the Santa Susana Mountains to the north, which separate Simi Valley from the Santa Clara River Valley, and the Simi Hills.|$|E
50|$|Bedford {{valley is}} a <b>synclinal</b> <b>valley,</b> with Evitts Mountain forming the eastern limb and Wills Mountain forming {{a part of}} the western limb. The {{northern}} end of Wills Mountain is known as Kinton Knob and is the crest of a plunging anticline. The Silurian Tuscarora Formation, a hard sandstone, outcrops at the crests of these ridges and is stratigraphically lower and thus older {{than the rest of the}} bedrock in the township. The overlying formations are either Silurian or Devonian in age, and include (in ascending order) the Clinton Group, the Bloomsburg Formation, the Mifflintown Formation, the Wills Creek Formation, the Tonoloway Formation, the Keyser Formation, the Old Port Formation, the Onondaga Formation, and the Hamilton Group, which is composed of the Marcellus Shale and the Mahantango Formation. The Ridgeley Member of the Old Port Formation, another sandstone and conglomerate, forms the low ridge in the center of the township south of the town of Bedford, as well as Stiffler Ridge in Dunning Cove. Dunning Cove itself is a structural basin.|$|E

In most parts of the belt the folds have a north vergence (Columbia Hills' south vergence is an exception) with the steep limb typically faulted by imbricate thrust faults. Fold lengths range from 1 km to 100 km with wavelengths from several kilometers to 20 km.|$|R

The drainage network of the watershed was delineated using satellite data IRS- 1 D (LISS-III data) and Survey of India toposheets were used as reference. The morphometric analysis of the watershed {{has been carried out}} using ERDAS Imagine 9. 2 and ARC GIS- 9. 2 version. The drainage network of the study area covering 789. 26 km 2. which exhibits dendritic drainage pattern. The stream order ranges from first to sixth order. The drainage density of the study area varies between 1. 12 to 3. 75 km/km 2 which observed that area is highly permeable and structurally controlled. The bifurcation ratio varies from 2. 47 to 4. 49 and the elongation ratio vary from 0. 37 to 0. 68 which reveals that Western Doon Valley is an asymmetrical longitudinal <b>synclinal</b> <b>valley</b> which extends for about 34 km. in length and 20 km in width and lies between two major rivers of Indian sub-continent. Hydrogeomorphologically the Western Doon Valley is classified into different zones covered by denudational hills, residual hills, high dissected hills, moderately dissected structural hills, upper piedmont, lowe...|$|E

A study on bank erosion and channel migration of the present course of the Khowai River through the <b>synclinal</b> <b>valley</b> of Atharamura and Baramura Hill Ranges indicates that the area is under active erosion since long back. In this study, the rate of channel migration has been assessed and variation of sinuosity index and radius of curvature have also been calculated. The study of the active channel width and channel position from 1975 to 2014 indicates that {{a large portion of}} land along both the banks of the Khowai River has already been eroded away. This work also documented land use changes in its surrounding flood plain area using supervised image classification. Overall accuracy of the land use classification ranges between 88 % and 93 %. The whole study is being done utilising the remote sensing imagery (2014), SOI topographical map (1975) and GIS technology. The land use classification shows that there is an increase in built up area and decrease in net sown area. The channel migration directly affects the land use and land use change has direct effect on the flood plain dwellers of the study area. All the assessments of this study highlight a significant message of immense vulnerability of Khowai River and also provide news about geomorphological instabilities of the study area...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 Surface-geology, oil-well, seismic-reflection, and magnetostratigraphic {{data are}} {{integrated}} to evaluate structural style and shortening rate at the Himalayan front (Sub-Himalaya) of northwest India. The Sub-Himalaya, between the Main Boundary thrust and the Himalayan Frontal fault, is the actively deforming {{front of the}} Himalaya. At certain locations, the Himalayan Frontal fault is a blind thrust beneath anticlines of Siwalik (Tertiary) molasse, parallel to the Himalayan arc. The Main Boundary thrust, in contrast, is sinuous, so that {{the width of the}} Sub-Himalaya ranges from 30 to 80 km. Where the Sub-Himalaya is narrow (Nahan salient), Tertiary rocks are exposed in imbricate thrust sheets; where the Sub-Himalaya is broad (Kangra and Dehra Dun reentrants), alluvium fills wide <b>synclinal</b> <b>valleys</b> (duns). Seismic-reflection data reveal that surface anticlines form in association with south-vergent thrusts that root in a decollement {{at the base of the}} Tertiary section. Reflection profiles and well data also indicate that the basement lithology changes northward from Precambrian crystalline rocks beneath the Indo-Gangetic plains to Precambrian and Cambrian metasedimentary rocks beneath the Sub-Himalaya. The Sub-Himalayan decollement dips 2. 5 ° northward beneath the Kangra reentrant, but it is steeper at 6 ° beneath the Dehra Dun reentrant. The Kangra and Dehra Dun reentrants are characterized by fault-propagation folds with steep limbs in the north and by broad anticlines with gently north-dipping limbs in the south. A balanced cross section of the Kangra reentrant shows that a minimum of 23 km shortening has occurred since 1. 9 - 1. 5 Ma, yielding a shortening rate of 14 ± 2 mm/yr. Shortening has occurred at a rate of 7 - 15 mm/yr across the Dehra Dun reentrant. These data compare with other published shortening rates and indicate that [approximatelyt] 25...|$|R
40|$|The eastern Jura Mountains {{consist of}} the Jura fold-thrust belt and the {{autochthonous}} Tabular Jura and Vesoul-Montbéliard Plateau. They are drained {{by the river}} Rhine, which flows into the North Sea, and the river Doubs, which flows into the Mediterranean. The internal drainage systems of the Jura fold-thrust belt consist of rivers flowing in <b>synclinal</b> <b>valleys</b> that are linked by river segments cutting orthogonally through anticlines. The latter appear to employ parts of the antecedent Jura Nagelfluh drainage system that had developed in response to Late Burdigalian uplift of the Vosges-Back Forest Arch, prior to Late Miocene-Pliocene deformation of the Jura fold-thrust belt. The following stages are recognized {{in the evolution of}} the Jura Mountain drainage systems: 1) middle to late Tortonian (10 – 7. 2 Ma) folding-related overpowering and partial reversal of the south-directed Jura Nagelfluh drainage system, 2) Messinian to early Pliocene (7. 2 – 4. 2 Ma) Aare-Danube and proto-Doubs stage, 3) early to middle Pliocene (4. 2 – 2. 9 Ma) Aare-Doubs stage, 4) late Pliocene to early Quaternary (2. 9 – 1. 7 Ma) Aare-Rhine and Doubs stage and 5) Quaternary (1. 7 – 0 Ma) Alpine-Rhine and Doubs stage. Development of the thin-skinned Jura fold-thrust belt controlled the first three stages of this drainage system evolution, whilst the last two stages were essentially governed by the subsidence of the Upper Rhine Graben, which resumed during the late Pliocene. Late Pliocene and Quaternary deep incision of the Aare-Rhine/Alpine-Rhine and its tributaries in the Jura Mountains and Black Forest is mainly attributed to lowering of the erosional base level in the continuously subsiding Upper Rhine Graben. Incision of the Doubs and Dessoubre canyons reflects uplift of the Franches-Montagnes and Franche-Comté in response to thick-skinned deformation of the Jura fold-thrust belt, which had commenced around 3 Ma. Geodetic data indicate that uplift of the Jura Mountains, relative to the Tabular Jura, presently continues at very low strain rates whilst the Upper Rhine Graben subsides very slowly and the Black Forest is relatively stable...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) Geological Sciences. Plate 1; Geologic map of {{a portion}} of {{the west side of the}} Temblor Range, San Luis Obispo and Kern Counties, California, in back pocket; {{includes}} data from Tertiary and Quaternary geologic time periods. Original map source; Polyconic projection. North American Datum 1927 (NAD 27). California Coordinate System, zone 5. Universal Transverse Mercator, zone 11 (UTM 11). Contour Interval 40 feet. Four sedimentary formations were mapped on the west side of the Temblor Range. The oldest, Panoche-Lodo Formation, is a cartographic unit combining the Upper Cretaceous Panoche Formation and the Paleocene-Lower and Middle Eocene Lodo Formation. It consists of 8, 000 feet or more of an olive-drab succession of "dirty" thin-bedded and massive siltstones and wackes deposited under mostly bathyal marine conditions. The Point of Rocks Sandstone is Upper Eocene. It consists of tan to light-gray fine- to coarse-grained quartz-rich calcareous arenite; cannonball concretions and cavernous-weathering characterize generally bold exposures. At least 2, 300 feet of sandstone and minor gray shale were deposited under tropical to subtropical marine neritic to bathyal conditions. During Miocene time the Monterey Formation was deposited under cool, shallow marine conditions. More than 4, 000 feet of siliceous shale, porcellanite and opaline chert were accumulated largely from siliceous tests of marine micro-organisms during the Zemorrian through Mohnian Stages. Abundance of fine clastic shales and sandstones increased during the lower Mohnian. Sandstone lenses are found distributed in irregular fashion throughout the Monterey Formation. More than 7, 500 feet of nonmarine Paso Robles Formation accumulated during Plio-Pleistocene time. Terrestrial gray to brown clay through boulder-sized debris accumulated rapidly in an inland basin. At least three periods of major deformation can be recognized in the area. At the end of the Panoche-Lodo deposition the strata were folded and eroded before deposition of the Point of Rocks Sandstone. An angular unconformity of + 30 degrees exists between the two formations. At the end of Monterey deposition, deformation folded and eroded the Miocene and Upper Eocene beds. The Paso Robles Formation was deposited with angular unconformity on the eroded Monterey Formation, and it is believed to have filled in <b>synclinal</b> <b>valleys</b> formed by post-Monterey deformation. Intense deformation at the end of Paso Robles deposition further folded the previously initiated folds and caused overturning of some of them. Contemporary with, and probably succeeding folding, the crest of the Temblor Range was uplifted 3, 000 to 5, 000 feet along the Salt Creek reverse fault. Continued uplift and erosion have shaped the Temblor physiography to its present form. Oil and gas exploration in the past has been without success. Several dry holes were drilled on both sides of the San Andreas Fault. Structural traps such as the Cottonwood Spring anticline and the footwall of the Salt Creek reverse fault merit further investigation. Gypsum deposits are subeconomic on the west side of the Temblor Range...|$|R
