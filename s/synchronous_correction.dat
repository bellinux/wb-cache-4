5000|$|Synchronous Idle (SYN) is the ASCII control {{character}} 22 (0x16), represented as ^V in caret notation. In EBCDIC the corresponding character is 50 (0x32). Synchronous Idle {{is used in}} some synchronous serial communication systems such as Teletype machines or the Binary Synchronous (Bisync) protocol to provide a signal from which <b>synchronous</b> <b>correction</b> may be achieved between data terminal equipment, [...] particularly when no other character is being transmitted.|$|E
40|$|An {{overview}} of the synchronization procedure for the CMS Tracker is given. The entire readout system of the Tracker, from the front-end APV readout chips to the back-end FEDs can be synchronized to ~ 1 ns, in a standalone mode, during commissioning. The procedure is based on measuring and compensating for the relative delays at the FED between the arrival of APV synchronization pulses transmitted over the analogue optical links. After correction for the optical link fibre-lengths the Tracker can be made fully <b>synchronous.</b> A <b>correction</b> for the time of flight of particles and then a sweep of the phase adjustment of the clock to the Tracker will achieve absolute synchronization of the Tracker with the LHC collisions. Some simple checks allow verification of the coarse and fine timing settings, as well as monitoring of the Tracker synchronization during Physics running. I...|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} plant comprised three 750 rpm 25 Hz turbo-alternators from Willans & Robinson of Rugby and Dick, Kerr of Preston, England with {{a continuous}} rating of 8.7 MW and a two-hour rating of 10.5 MW. The first unit was tested in 1913, before the buildings that housed it were completed. The second set {{was installed in}} 1917. Delivery of the third Dick, Kerr unit was delayed, and it was initially installed at Ultimo Power Station upon arrival from England in 1914. Owing to the delay of the third Dick, Kerr unit, a single Curtis 7.5 MW turbo-alternator from General Electric of Schenectady, New York, USA was brought into temporary use in 1917 in the unit number four position. The third Dick, Kerr unit was transferred from Ultimo to White Bay as unit no. 3 in 1918, giving the station an initial capacity of 28.5 MW. Steam was supplied by 8 Babcock & Wilcox,WIF long drum, chain grate, boilers. They each produced 30,000 lb/hour at a pressure of 205 psi and a temperature of 588 Â°F. Unit no. 1 was decommissioned in 1944, but its alternator was reconfigured {{for use as a}} <b>synchronous</b> condenser, for <b>correction</b> of power factor in the 25 cycle per second grid. The other 2 sets were scrapped by 1948.|$|R
