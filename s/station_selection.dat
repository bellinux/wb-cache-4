5000|$|The Cavalcade {{features}} a 16 valve DOHC 1360 cc V4 with hydraulic lash adjusters and shaft drive for low maintenance. Many {{of the standard}} features on the Cavalcade were considered options on other motorcycles in 1985. The LX and LXE models feature self-cancelling turn signals, automatic rear pneumatic leveling system, rear suspension load pre-tensioner, air-adjustable damping on the front shocks that could be refilled with a standard tire pump connection, electronic cruise control, radio and cassette deck with LCD station display, volume and <b>station</b> <b>selection</b> controls on the handlebars, adjustment knob for the headlight, adjustable passenger floorboards, fore to aft top case adjustment for passenger comfort, adjustable handlebars and adjustable windshield. The radio is in a decorative housing that resembles a standard motorcycle fuel tank. The radio has an automatic volume control that raises and lowers the radio volume based on {{the speed of the}} motorcycle. The Cavalcade fuel tank is located under the driver's seat but is filled {{from the top of the}} decorative tank. A standard automobile-type oil filter is located midline of the underside of the chassis between the exhaust pipes. The engine is liquid cooled with a thermostatically-controlled electric fan. The radio antenna could be unscrewed and lowered so as not to interfere with the positioning of the weather cover, which was standard with all models.|$|E

The top case has an interior light and vanity mirror. The top case is large enough to accept a full face helmet. Two helmet locks that use the ignition key are just below the top case and above the license plate. Soft, form-fitted bags came standard for the side cases and the top case. The console features a LCD display that has the gear position indicator as well as warnings for low battery water and [...] "kickstand down." [...] The bike had a switch linked to the kickstand that would kill the engine if the bike were put in gear with the kickstand in the down position. There are vents near the ignition key that allows air to be directed towards the driver's face and doors on both sides of the fairing that can be opened to allow engine heat to be directed toward the driver's legs. The passenger had controls to adjust the radio volume and <b>station</b> <b>selection.</b> The passenger seat has a 3-way adjustable passenger seat on both models. LXE models were equipped with cornering lights, air adjustable driver's seat, coin-holder and map case in the driver's storage boxes, leg wind deflectors and driver/passenger intercom jacks. There was a CB radio option. A driver [...] and passenger headrest were options. They are also equipped with an electrical accessory plug and a 500 watt alternator.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} charging station pricing and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) <b>station</b> <b>selection.</b> When a PEV needs to be charged, it selects a charging station by considering the charging prices, waiting times, and travel distances. Each charging station optimizes its charging price based on the prediction of the PEVs' charging <b>station</b> <b>selection</b> decisions and the other station's pricing decision, {{in order to maximize}} its profit. To obtain insights of such a highly coupled system, we consider a one-dimensional system with two competing charging stations and Poisson arriving PEVs. We propose a multi-leader-multi-follower Stackelberg game model, in which the charging stations (leaders) announce their charging prices in Stage I, and the PEVs (followers) make their charging station selections in Stage II. We show that there always exists a unique charging <b>station</b> <b>selection</b> equilibrium in Stage II, and such equilibrium depends on the charging stations' service capacities and the price difference between them. We then characterize the sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the pricing equilibrium in Stage I. We also develop a low complexity algorithm that efficiently computes the pricing equilibrium and the subgame perfect equilibrium of the two-stage Stackelberg game. Comment: 15 pages, 21 figure...|$|E

In this paper, we investigate base <b>station</b> <b>selection</b> (or anycast) problem in wireless sensor networks. We consider a wire-less sensor network having multiple base stations (data sink nodes), where each source node must send all its locally generated data to only one base station. To maximize the network lifetime, it is essential to optimally match each source node to a particular base station in addition to find-ing an optimal routing solution. We propose a polynomial time heuristic for optimal base <b>station</b> <b>selection</b> for anycast via a sequential fixing procedure, under the assumption that the bit rate from each source node is constant. Through ex-tensive simulation results, we show that this heuristic has excellent performance behavior and is a tight low bound that is very close to optimal solution for the original opti-mization problem. ...|$|E

Our two-phased approach attempts to minimize both the monitoring infrastructure costs {{as well as}} the additional traffic due to probe messages. In the first phase of our approach, we compute the locations of a minimal set of monitoring stations such that all network links are covered, even in the presence of several link failures. Subsequently, in the second phase, we compute a minimal set of probe messages that are transmitted by the stations to measure link delays and isolate network faults. We show that both the <b>station</b> <b>selection</b> problem {{as well as the}} probe assignment problem are NP-hard. We then propose greedy approximation algorithms that achieve a logarithmic approximation factor for the <b>station</b> <b>selection</b> problem and a constant factor for the probe assignment problem.

It is impractical task for the receiver station to decode the transmitted signal successfully at the cell edges, which increases the high packet loss and retransmissions. But Wimax is a outstanding technology which is used for improving the quality of internet service and also it offers various services like Voice over Internet Protocol, Video conferencing and Multimedia broadcast etc where a little delay in packet transmission can cause a big loss in the communication.
