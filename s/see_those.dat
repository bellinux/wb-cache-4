25|$|The {{content of}} the OED2 is mostly just a {{reorganization}} of the earlier corpus, but the retypesetting provided an opportunity for two long-needed format changes. The headword of each entry was no longer capitalized, allowing the user to readily <b>see</b> <b>those</b> words that actually require a capital letter. Murray had devised his own notation for pronunciation, there being no standard available at the time, whereas the OED2 adopted the modern International Phonetic Alphabet. Unlike the earlier edition, all foreign alphabets except Greek were transliterated.|$|E

25|$|As the {{consensus}} of Japanese jurists is that Japanese forces did not technically commit violations of international law, many right wing elements in Japan have taken this to mean that war crimes trials were examples of victor's justice. They <b>see</b> <b>those</b> convicted of war crimes as , Shōwa being the name given {{to the rule of}} Hirohito. This interpretation is vigorously contested by Japanese peace groups and the political left. In the past, these groups have tended to argue that the trials hold some validity, either under the Geneva Convention (even though Japan hadn't signed it), or under an undefined concept of international law or consensus. Alternatively, they have argued that, although the trials may not have been technically valid, they were still just, somewhat in line with popular opinion in the West and in the rest of Asia.|$|E

[...] According to Lewis, all five men piled on Schulz every play, and Schulz held Penn scoreless for 50minutes before they [...] "finally knocked him out". [...] Lewis concluded: [...] "Never before or since has there been such a one-man show of defensive football as Schulz displayed against Penn".|$|E

[...] Having enlisted the help of his lover, Peter Fisk, and another man, Poole first shot a ten-minute segment entitled Bayside.|$|E
500|$|Lyricist Tim Rice, who {{was working}} with {{composer}} Alan Menken on songs for Aladdin, was invited to write the songs, and accepted {{on the condition of}} finding a composing partner. As Menken was unavailable, the producers accepted Rice's suggestion of Elton John, after Rice's invitation of ABBA fell through due to Benny Andersson being busy with the musical Kristina från Duvemåla. John expressed an interest in writing [...] "ultra-pop songs that kids would like; then adults can go and <b>see</b> <b>those</b> movies and get just as much pleasure out of them", mentioning a possible influence of The Jungle Book, where he felt the [...] "music was so funny and appealed to kids and adults".|$|E
500|$|Since February 2006, Lindesfarne has {{had her own}} blog titled [...] "Virtual Quill". Originally, she was posting it as a sort {{of private}} journal, using the inter{{dimension}}al portal to make sure that if it were ever seen by others, it would only be seen by humans from her native dimension (namely, our world), not the dimension she's called home {{for the vast majority of}} her life. She would post generally once a week, talking about the various events in her life and those of her friends and family, providing additional information and insights into what was shown on the strip. Many fans commented back to her as if she were a real person, but she couldn’t <b>see</b> <b>those</b> comments at first because her interdimensional Internet connection was one-way (write-only).|$|E

In the poem, one line reads [...] "Alas! For this gray shadow, once a man." [...] VanWinkle argues that in The X-Files episode, this line is paralleled by Alfred Fellig's tendency to <b>see</b> <b>those</b> about to die in a monochromatic vision. Furthermore, both the poem and the episode stress that death is not appealing because it is simply [...] "a means to an end". Rather, it is to be sought because it [...] "is the event that most fully unites us with other humans." ...|$|E
500|$|The scarce {{artifacts}} {{found in}} the city dating to the Bronze Age reveal that, culturally, Palmyra was most affiliated with western Syria. Classical Palmyra had a distinctive culture, based on a local Semitic tradition, and influenced by Greece and Rome. To appear better integrated into the Roman Empire, some Palmyrenes adopted Greco-Roman names, either alone or {{in addition to a}} second native name. The extent of Greek influence on Palmyra's culture is debated. Scholars interpreted the Palmyrenes' Greek practices differently; many <b>see</b> <b>those</b> characters as a superficial layer over a local essence. Palmyra's senate was an example; although Palmyrene texts written in Greek described it as a [...] "boule" [...] (a Greek institution), the senate was a gathering of non-elected tribal elders (a Near-Eastern assembly tradition). Others view Palmyra's culture as a fusion of local and Greco-Roman traditions.|$|E
500|$|Woodburne {{has said}} she never gets bored of playing Susan as she changes all the time. She added [...] "One of the upsides of this job {{is that in a}} week you might be doing {{absolute}} slapstick comedy, you might be doing high drama/tragedy and in between maybe some nice subtle interesting stuff as well, the character keeps changing and evolving depending on who she is interacting with". Woodburne has said that her favourite storyline has been the Susan, Karl and Izzy love triangle. As Susan is normally a good person, it gave her a chance to have a character (Izzy) that she could hate. Woodburne added [...] "It was good to play those much meaner, darker, angrier, cruel moments than always to be the kind character. It was good to <b>see</b> <b>those</b> dents in her armour I think".|$|E

500|$|The game {{features}} a story mode, playable {{from two different}} perspectives. The perspectives consist of one segment from the DC Universe side, and one from the Mortal Kombat side, each split up into various chapters. Depending on which side players choose, the characters from one universe <b>see</b> <b>those</b> from the opposite universe as the invaders of their own. Ed Boon, creative director of Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe and co-creator of the Mortal Kombat franchise, did confirm that the player would {{have the ability to}} play as all the characters in the story mode at one point during development, but the story mode ultimately lacked story arcs for a few characters. Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe also contains a mode called [...] "Kombo Challenge". Its aspect is individual to the Versus and Story modes, where players must perform ten precreated combos of increasing difficulty.|$|E
500|$|Like {{other black}} {{players in the}} 1940s and 1950s, Motley faced racist attitudes {{both on and off}} the field. Paul Brown would not {{tolerate}} discrimination within the team; he wanted to win and would not let anything get in his way. Motley and Willis, however, were sometimes stepped on and called names during games. [...] "Sometimes I wanted to just kill some of those guys, and the officials would just stand right there," [...] Motley said many years later. [...] "They'd <b>see</b> <b>those</b> guys stepping on us and heard them saying things and just turn their backs. That kind of crap went on for two or three years until they found out what kind of players we were." [...] Motley and Willis did not travel to one game against the Miami Seahawks in the Browns' early years after they received threatening letters. Another time in Miami, Motley and Willis were told they were not welcome at the hotel where the team was staying. Brown threatened to relocate the entire team, and the hotel's management backed down.|$|E

The entrance to the station, which is a quarter-scale replica of the real London King's Cross railway station, {{is located in the}} London area, close to Diagon Alley. Passengers enter the station building and have their admission ticket checked. They then enter a queue which takes them farther into the station building, under a split-flap departure board, and past London-related advertisements, several stacks of suitcases and a shop selling food. After ascending a flight of stairs, passengers find themselves between signs for King's Cross Platform 9 and Platform 10. They can <b>see</b> <b>those</b> ahead of them walking through the [...] "wall" [...] forming the entrance to Platform [...] This effect uses the Pepper's ghost illusion.
