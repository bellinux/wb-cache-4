5|$|An {{agreement}} was signed with Amadeus in 2007 to upgrade Biman's ticketing system with an e-ticketing solution {{to comply with}} IATA rules, which set out a deadline of 31 December 2007 for all member airlines to <b>switch</b> <b>over</b> their ticketing systems. E-ticketing has enabled major airlines to provide online check-in facilities, reducing the need to queue up at check-in counters. However, Biman has not made any attempts to improve customer service through the adoption of e-ticketing, {{although it has been}} able to reduce its own costs. In 2005, Biman had briefly stopped using the Amadeus ticketing system when the government suspended the operation of a local Amadeus subsidiary following a court order, after allegations of money laundering. The suspension, however, lasted only a month, and was lifted after the writ was appealed in the High Court.|$|E

25|$|Ireland {{commenced}} its <b>switch</b> <b>over</b> to its free-to-air {{digital terrestrial}} television (DTT) in October 2010. This provided viewers with greater viewing opportunities {{with an increase in}} public service channels, i.e. of commercial services with the possibility of more public service channels from existing public service broadcaster and possibly two new channels, the Houses of the Oireachtas Channel and the Irish Film Channel, subject to finance from the government for the last two. The then Minister for Communications Pat Rabbitte aspired to have a complete DTT service rolled out by 31 December 2011.|$|E

Brooks. It was first broadcast on ABC in January 1994 and was well received by critics, but did not catch on with viewers and was put on hiatus after six weeks. It returned in June 1994 and completed airing its initial production run. For the second season of The Critic, Brooks {{cut a deal with}} the Fox network to have the series <b>switch</b> <b>over.</b>|$|E

Calls from landlines in Northern Ireland to numbers in the Republic of Ireland are charged at the same rate as those to numbers in Great Britain, while landline numbers in Northern Ireland can similarly be called from the Republic of Ireland at domestic rates, using the 048 prefix.|$|E
25|$|Raj Bisaria {{was aware}} {{from the very}} {{beginning}} that any worthwhile theatre activity had to find its moorings in Hindi and other Indian languages. He sought the co-operation of the then existing theatre groups to realize his plans to establish a bilingual theatre in Lucknow. But his effort failed to elicit any response from them. He even brought the production rights of Mohan Rakesh’s well known play, Adhe-Adhure, which he could not stage for want of a suitable cast. In his bid to <b>switch</b> <b>over</b> to Hindi drama, he invited Delhi groups to produce, under TAW’s auspices, plays in Hindi with a view to making local groups conscious of the potentialities and challenges of Hindi Theatre.|$|E
25|$|After {{several months}} of press publicity, leaflet drops, public {{meetings}} etc., captions started appearing on analogue broadcasts from the affected transmitters, warning viewers that the analogue service would shortly be switched off {{and that they would}} need to take action (for Whitehaven, the first large area to <b>switch</b> <b>over,</b> the captions started appearing some 5 months before the BBC Two analogue service was switched off). At about the same time, details of the Switchover Help Scheme were distributed. Although viewers who live outside existing Freeview reception areas were unable to test any digital receiving equipment they had bought at this early stage, test-screens on Ceefax (BBC One & Two) and Teletext (ITV & C4/S4C) page 284 made it possible to determine whether they were likely to need a new aerial or a signal amplifier to receive digital transmissions.|$|E

25|$|On Monday 29 September 2009 RTÉ {{revealed}} {{a proposal for}} the regeneration of its existing building which will cost €350million. If approved, the project would see the gradual replacement over a 10- to 15-year period {{of most of the}} current 1960s and 1970s buildings on the Donnybrook site. The new building would accommodate the <b>switch</b> <b>over</b> to high-definition, additional channels and new studios. RTÉ has since received planning consent from Dublin City Council for an application for the redevelopment of the station's Donnybrook site.The proposal for redevelopment of the site was accepted by local councillors last November 2009.The next stage of the planning process involves all parties having an opportunity to lodge appeals with An Bord Pleanála over the coming four weeks (by May 2010).The proposal would also involve building a new entrance onto the N11 Stillorgan dual carriageway.|$|E
25|$|A 3-cent Washington-head coil stamp (Scott 389) {{issued in}} 1911 is {{commonly}} referred to as the Orangeburg coil. It was printed with the flat-plate press on single-line watermarked paper with vertical, gauge 12, perforations. The Post Office produced only a small batch of these stamps (it would soon <b>switch</b> <b>over</b> to gauge 8½ perforations for coils) and apparently sold them all to the Bell Pharmaceutical Company, which used 3¢ coil stamps to send samples of their products to physicians through the mail. The actual quantity issued remains unknown. The earliest known use on cover is dated April 27, 1911. Due to the quantity of mail, they were put through the first-class canceling machine at Orangeburg, New York and were mailed third-class. Because these stamps were used on third class mail, most were eventually discarded. Owing to its limited and specific usage philatelists were at first unaware of this issue for approximately two years and so very few examples were saved and collected in mint condition, which accounts for their rarity of this issue today. Approximately twelve covers have been certified as genuine by the Philatelic Foundation. The Orangeburg coils are the rarest coils of the Washington-Franklin issues.|$|E
25|$|A {{launched}} on February 1, 1984, initially available to 9.3 million cable television {{homes in the}} U.S. and Canada. The network {{is a result of}} the 1984 merger of Hearst/ABC's Alpha Repertory Television Service (ARTS) and (pre–General Electric merger) RCA-owned The Entertainment Channel. When A debuted, the channel took over the satellite transponder timeslot that ARTS occupied from its launch in 1981. Children's television channel Nickelodeon signed off just before 9:00p.m. Eastern Time, and A took over at 9:00p.m. with a three-hour programming block, which was repeated at 9:00p.m. Pacific Time. In January 1985, A moved to its own dedicated transponder and began delivering its programming 24 hours a day, while Nickelodeon replaced the vacated A programming with a classic television block, Nick at Nite, on July 1 of that year. However, some cable providers continued to carry Nickelodeon and A on the same channel and would usually <b>switch</b> <b>over</b> to A at 8:00p.m. Eastern. It was not until the early 1990s, when providers began installing advanced headend equipment that allowed for expanded channel capacity, that these companies allocated separate channels for both networks.|$|E

25|$|The bailout {{block is}} a small {{manifold}} fitted either to the harness where {{it is in a}} convenient but protected position, commonly on the right side on the waist strap, or on the helmet, also usually {{on the right side of}} the temple, with the valve knob to the side to distinguish it from the free-flow or defogging valve which is commonly to the front. The bailout block has a connection for the main gas supply from the umbilical through a non-return valve. This route can not be closed and supplies the helmet demand valve and free flow valve under normal circumstances. The bailout gas from the back mounted cylinder passes through a conventional scuba first stage at the cylinder valve, to the bailout block, where it is normally isolated by the bailout valve. When the diver needs to <b>switch</b> <b>over</b> to bailout gas he simply opens the bailout valve and the gas is supplied to the helmet or mask. As the valve is normally closed, a leak in the first stage regulator seat will cause the interstage pressure to rise, and unless an overpressure relief valve is fitted to the first stage the hose may burst. Aftermarket overpressure valves are available which can be fitted into a standard low-pressure port of most first stages.|$|E

The advertisement drew much attention, though James Blish commented that Galaxy did not always avoid printing the kind of fiction it parodied.|$|E
