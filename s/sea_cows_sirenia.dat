5000|$|The Takikawa <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> (Hydrodamalis spissa) is an extinct herbivorous {{marine mammal}} of the Pleistocene, which was {{closely related to}} the {{recently}} extinct Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> (H. gigas). In 1988, fossils of <b>sea</b> <b>cows</b> were discovered in Hokkaido, but were originally assigned to the Takikawa <b>sea</b> <b>cow,</b> a newly described species, even though this taxon is thought of by some scientists as a synonym of the Cuesta <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> (H. cuestae). It is uncertain whether or not the Takikawa <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> was simply a local variant of the Cuesta <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> or a completely separate lineage. However, Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> and the Takikawa <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> share more morphological similarities than between the Takikawa <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> and the Cuesta <b>sea</b> <b>cow.</b>|$|R
50|$|Stellers <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> was {{a direct}} {{descendant}} of the Cuesta <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> (H. cuestae), an extinct tropical <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> that lived {{off the coast of}} western North America, particularly California. The Cuesta <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> is thought to have gone extinct due to the onset of the Quaternary glaciation and the subsequent cooling of the oceans. Many populations died out, while the lineage of Stellers <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> was able to adapt to the colder temperatures. The Takikawa <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> (H. spissa) of Japan is thought of by some researchers to be a taxonomic synonym of the Cuesta <b>sea</b> <b>cow,</b> but based on a comparison of endocasts, the Takikawa and Stellers <b>sea</b> <b>cows</b> are more derived than the Cuesta <b>sea</b> <b>cow.</b> This has led some to believe that the Takikawa <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> is its own species. The evolution of the Hydrodamalis genus was characterized by increased size and a loss of teeth and phalanges {{as a response to the}} onset of the Quaternary glaciation.|$|R
50|$|Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> had a {{thicker layer}} of blubber than {{other members of}} the order. This {{adaptation}} was due to the cold waters of its environment. The <b>sea</b> <b>cow's</b> tail was forked, like that of cetaceans. The <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> did not have teeth, instead having an array of white bristles on its upper lip and two keratinous plates within its mouth for chewing. Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> fed mainly on kelp, and communicated via sighs and snorting sounds. Evidence suggests that the <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> was a monogamous and social animal, living in small family groups and raising its young, similar to extant sirenians.|$|R
50|$|Like other sirenians, Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> was an obligate {{herbivore}} {{and spent}} most of the day feeding, only lifting its head every 4 to 5 minutes for breathing. Kelp was its main food source, making it an algivore. The <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> likely fed on several species of kelp, which have been identified as: Agarum spp., Alaria praelonga, Halosaccion glandiforme, Laminaria saccharina, Nereocyctis luetkeana and Thalassiophyllum clathrus. Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> only fed directly on the soft parts of the kelp, which caused the tougher stem and holdfast to wash up on the shore in heaps. The <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> may have also fed on seagrass, but the plant was not common enough to support a viable population and could not have been the <b>sea</b> <b>cow's</b> primary food source. Further, the available seagrasses in the <b>sea</b> <b>cow's</b> range (Phyllospadix spp. and Zostera marina) may have grown too deep underwater or been too tough for the animal to consume. Since the <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> floated, it likely fed on canopy kelp, as it is believed to have only had access to food no deeper than 1 m below the tide. Kelp releases a chemical deterrent to protect it from grazing, but canopy kelp releases a lower concentration of the chemical, allowing the <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> to graze safely. Steller noted that the <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> grew thin during the frigid winters, indicating a period of fasting due to low kelp growth. Fossils of Pleistocene Aleutian Island <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> populations were larger than those from the Commander Islands, indicating that the growth of Commander Island <b>sea</b> <b>cows</b> may have been stunted due to a less favorable habitat and less food than the warmer Aleutian Islands.|$|R
50|$|The {{fossils of}} the Cuesta <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> were first {{discovered}} in the Late Pliocene sediment formations of Pismo Beach, California in 1978, and following finds of the species were unearthed in California. In 1988, fossils of <b>sea</b> <b>cows</b> were discovered in Hokkaido, but were originally assigned to the Takikawa <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> (H. spissa), a newly described species, but this is thought of by some scientists as a synonym of H. cuestae. It is uncertain whether or not H. spissa was simply a local variant of H. cuestae or a completely separate lineage. The Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> was apparently a direct descendant of the Cuesta <b>sea</b> <b>cow.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Cuesta <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> went extinct around 2 and a {{half million}} years ago. The {{disappearance}} of the Cuesta <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> was likely linked to the onset of the Quaternary glaciation Its main food source of seagrasses, due to the cooling of the oceans, declined to a point where it could no longer support their population. As well as this, the <b>sea</b> <b>cows</b> themselves were not adapted to the cold, and those that were probably gave rise to the Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>sea</b> <b>cow's</b> spine is {{believed}} to have had 7 neck, 17 thoracic, 3 lumbar, and 34 caudal (tail) vertebrae. Its ribs were large, with 5 of 17 pairs making contact with the sternum; the <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> had no clavicles. As in all sirenians, the scapula of Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> was fan-shaped being larger on the posterior side and narrower towards the neck. However, the anterior border of the scapula was nearly straight, whereas those of modern sirenians are curved. Like other sirenians, the bones of Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> were pachyosteosclerotic, meaning they were both bulky (pachyostotic) and dense (osteosclerotic). [...] In all collected skeletons of the <b>sea</b> <b>cow,</b> the manus is missing: since Dusisiren—the sister taxon of Hydrodamalis—had reduced phalanges (finger bones), it is possible that Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> did not have a manus at all.|$|R
50|$|Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> {{was quickly}} {{wiped out by}} fur traders, seal hunters, and others who {{followed}} Vitus Bering's route past the <b>sea</b> <b>cow's</b> habitat and to Alaska. It was also hunted to collect its valuable subcutaneous fat. By 1768, 27 years after it had been discovered by Europeans, Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> was extinct. In 1887 Stejneger estimated {{that there had been}} fewer than 1,500 individuals remaining at the time of Steller's discovery, and thus there was already an immediate danger of the <b>sea</b> <b>cow's</b> extinction.|$|R
50|$|The Cuesta <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> (Hydrodamalis cuestae) is an extinct herbivorous marine mammal, and {{the direct}} {{ancestor}} of the Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> (Hydrodamalis gigas). They {{reached up to}} 9 m in length, making them among the biggest sirenians to have ever lived. They were first described in 1978 by Daryl Domning when fossils in California were unearthed. Its appearance and behavior are largely based on that of the well-documented Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow,</b> who, unlike the Cuesta <b>sea</b> <b>cow,</b> lived into modern times and was well described.|$|R
50|$|Freshwater <b>Sea</b> <b>Cows</b> have traits {{common to}} both {{manatees}} or <b>sea</b> <b>cows</b> and dairy cows. They live in underwater tunnels {{as well as}} open water, and consume plants.|$|R
50|$|Stellers <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> was {{a member}} of the genus Hydrodamalis, a group of large sirenians, whose sister taxon was Dusisiren. Like those of Stellers <b>sea</b> <b>cow,</b> the {{ancestors}} of Dusisiren lived in tropical mangroves before adapting to the cold climates of the North Pacific. Hydrodamalis and Dusisiren are classified together in the subfamily Hydrodamalinae, which diverged from other sirenians around 4 to 8 mya. Stellers <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> is a member of the family Dugongidae, whose sole surviving member, and thus Stellers <b>sea</b> <b>cows</b> closest living relative, is the dugong (Dugong dugon).|$|R
5000|$|Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> (Hydrodamalis gigas) is an {{extinct species}} of sirenian first {{discovered}} by Europeans in 1741. At {{the time of}} its discovery, the <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> was found only around the Commander Islands, located in the Bering Sea between Alaska and Russia, however their range was more extensive during the Pleistocene epoch. It is possible that Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> and humans interacted before their discovery on the Commander Islands. Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> would reach weights of 8 - 10 MT and lengths of up to 9 m. The <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> {{was a part of the}} order Sirenia, and member of the family Dugongidae, of which its closest living relative, the 3 m long dugong (Dugong dugon), is the sole surviving member.|$|R
5000|$|Hydrodamalis is a genus of extinct herbivorous sirenian marine mammals, and {{included}} the Stellers <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> (Hydrodamalis gigas), the Cuesta <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> (Hydrodamalis cuestae), and the Takikawa <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> (Hydrodamalis spissa). The fossil genus Dusisiren {{is regarded as}} the sister taxon of Hydrodamalis: together, the two genera form the dugong subfamily Hydrodamalinae. They were the largest member of the order Sirenia, whose only extant members are the dugong (Dugong dugon) and the manatees (Trichechus spp.). They reached up to 9 m in length, making the Stellers <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> among the largest mammals other than whales to have existed in the Holocene epoch. [...] Stellers <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> was first described by Georg Wilhelm Steller, Cuesta by Daryl Domning, and Takikawa by Hitoshi Furusawa. The Stellers <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> was {{the only member of the}} genus to survive into modern times, and, although had formerly been abundant throughout the North Pacific, by the mid 1700s, its range had been limited to a single, isolated population surrounding the uninhabited Commander Islands. It was hunted for its meat, skin, and fat by fur traders, and was also hunted by aboriginals of the North Pacific coast, leading to its and the generas extinction 27 years after discovery. The Cuesta <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> along with the Takikawa <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> were probably extinct at the end of the Pliocene due to the onset of the Ice Ages and the subsequent recession of seagrasses—their main food source.|$|R
50|$|The <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> {{used its}} forelimbs for swimming, feeding, walking in shallow water, {{defending}} itself, and for {{holding on to}} its partner during copulation. According to Steller, the forelimbs were also used to anchor the <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> down {{to prevent it from}} being swept away by the strong nearshore waves. While grazing, the <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> progressed slowly by moving its tail (fluke) from side to side, while more rapid movement was achieved by strong vertical beating of the tail. They often slept on their backs after feeding. According to Steller, the <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> was nearly mute and made only heavy breathing sounds, raspy snorting similar to a horse, and sighs.|$|R
50|$|Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> was {{discovered}} in the mid-18th century (1741) by Georg Wilhelm Steller, and was subsequently named after him. Steller researched the wildlife of Bering Island while he was shipwrecked there for about a year; the animals on the island included relict populations of <b>sea</b> <b>cows,</b> <b>sea</b> otters, Steller sea lions, and northern fur seals. Steller's account was included in his posthumous publication De bestiis marinis, or The Beasts of the Sea, {{which was published in}} 1751 by the Russian Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg. Zoologist Eberhard von Zimmermann formally described Stellar's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> in 1780 as Manati gigas. Biologist Anders Jahan Retzius, however, put the <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> in the genus Hydrodamalis, with the specific name of stelleri, in honor of Steller. In 1811, naturalist Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger reclassified Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> into the genus Rytina, which many writers at the time adopted, despite the <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> having already been classified. The name Hydrodamalis gigas was first used in 1895 by Theodore Sherman Palmer. For decades after its discovery, no skeletal remains of a Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> were discovered. This may have been due to rising and falling sea levels {{over the course of the}} Quaternary period, which could have left many <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> bones hidden. The first bones of a Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> were unearthed in about 1840, over 70 years after it was presumed extinct. The first partial <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> skull {{was discovered}} in 1844 by Ilya Voznesensky while on the Commander Islands, and the first skeleton {{was discovered in}} 1855 on northern Bering Island. These specimens were sent to St. Petersburg in 1857, and another nearly complete skeleton arrived in Moscow around 1860. Most of the skeletal remains were unearthed in the late 1800s: between 1878 and 1883, 12 of the known 27 skeletons were discovered. Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld, Benedykt Dybowski, and Leonhard Hess Stejneger each unearthed many bones from different individuals during this period, from which composite skeletons were assembled. As of 2006, 27 nearly complete skeletons and 62 complete skulls have been found.|$|R
50|$|A 2004 study {{reported}} that <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> bones discovered on Adak Island were around 1,700 years old, and <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> bones discovered on Buldir Island {{were found to be}} around 1,600 years old. However it is possible the bones were from cetaceans and were misclassified. Rib bones of a Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> have also been found on St. Lawrence Island, and the specimen is thought to have lived between 800 and 920 CE.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>sea</b> <b>cow's</b> {{head was}} small and short in {{comparison}} to its huge body. The animal's upper lip was large and broad, extending so far beyond the lower jaw that the mouth appeared to be located underneath the skull. Unlike other sirenians, Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> was toothless and instead had a dense array of interlacing white bristles on its upper lip. The bristles were approximately 1.5 in in length and were used to tear seaweed stalks and hold food. The <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> also had two keratinous plates located on its palate and mandible used for chewing. According to Steller, these plates (or [...] "masticatory pads") were held together by interdental papillae, {{a part of the}} gums, and had many small holes containing nerves and arteries.As with all sirenians, the <b>sea</b> <b>cow's</b> snout pointed downwards, which allowed it to better grasp kelp. The <b>sea</b> <b>cow's</b> nostrils were roughly 2 in long and wide. In addition to those within its mouth, the <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> also had stiff, 10 - 12.7 cm long bristles protruding from its muzzle. Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> had small eyes located halfway between its nostrils and ears with black irises, [...] eyeballs, and canthi which were not externally visible. The animal had no eyelashes, but like other diving creatures such as sea otters, Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> had a membrane which covered its eyes to prevent injury while feeding. The tongue {{was small and}} remained {{in the back of the}} mouth, unable to reach the masticatory (chewing) pads.|$|R
50|$|Etienne de France {{wrote and}} {{produced}} his 59-minute pseudo-documentary 2012 film Tales of a <b>Sea</b> <b>Cow.</b> This film portrays a fictional 2006 re-discovery by marine biologists {{of a living}} population of the Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow,</b> an extinct sirenian species, {{off the coast of}} Greenland in the Arctic Ocean and Atlantic Ocean via analysis of sound recordings of their calls. The Steller's <b>Sea</b> <b>Cow</b> is known historically only from several islands in the Bering Sea, and prehistorically as a fossil at various sites on both the North American and Asian sides of the Pacific Ocean; no known Steller's <b>Sea</b> <b>Cow</b> has ever lived in the North Atlantic Ocean (although species of the related manatee do live in southern portions).|$|R
50|$|Steller {{described}} the <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> as being highly social (gregarious). The <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> lived in small family groups and helped injured members, while also apparently being monogamous. Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> may have exhibited parental care, {{and the young}} were kept {{at the front of}} the herd for protection against predators. Steller reported that as a female was being captured, a group of other <b>sea</b> <b>cows</b> attacked the hunting boat by ramming and rocking it, and after the hunt, her mate followed the boat to shore, even after the captured animal had died. Mating season occurred in early spring and gestation took a little over a year, with calves likely delivered in autumn, as Steller noted that he observed a greater number of calves in autumn than at any other time of the year. Since female <b>sea</b> <b>cows</b> had only one set of mammary glands, it is likely that they had one calf at a time.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first attempt}} to hunt Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> by Steller and the other crew members was {{unsuccessful}} due to the animal's strength and its thick hide. The attempted method was to impale the <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> and haul it to shore using a large hook and heavy cable, but the crew could not pierce the skin. The second attempt did not occur until a month later, when a harpooner speared the animal, and men on shore hauled it in while others repeatedly stabbed it with bayonets. The <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> was dragged into shallow waters, and the crew waited until the tide receded and the animal was beached to butcher it. After this, they hunted Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cows</b> with relative ease, the challenge being in hauling the animal back to shore. This success in hunting <b>sea</b> <b>cows</b> inspired maritime fur traders to detour to the Commander Islands and restock their food supplies during North Pacific expeditions.|$|R
50|$|The Cuesta <b>sea</b> <b>cow,</b> {{like the}} Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow,</b> was {{probably}} gregarious {{and lived in}} small family groups. The bones were dense {{and served as a}} sort of ballast to prevent floating, probably so that they could feed on bottom-dwelling sea grasses. Sea grasses were their preferred food source. They most likely 'walked' along the shallow seafloor using their front limbs, using their powerful tail fin for propulsion. It has been speculated that, like the Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cows,</b> the front limbs were used as holdfasts. The Cuesta <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> was among the largest of the sirenians to have ever lived, reaching up to 9 m in length and possibly 10 t. The body was fusiform, being tapered at both the head and the tail.|$|R

5000|$|The {{presence}} of Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cows</b> in the Aleutian Islands {{may have caused}} the Aleut people to migrate westward to hunt them, possibly leading to the <b>sea</b> <b>cow's</b> extinction in that area, assuming the animals survived in that region into the Holocene epoch, however there is no archaeological evidence.|$|R
5000|$|Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> was {{described}} as being [...] "tasty" [...] by Steller; the meat {{was said to have}} a similar taste to corned beef, though it was tougher, redder, and needed to be cooked for longer. Due to the <b>sea</b> <b>cow's</b> size, the meat was plentiful, and it lasted a long time, perhaps due the high amount of salt in the animal's diet. This delayed spoiling to some extent, with the salt effectively curing it. The <b>sea</b> <b>cow's</b> fat could be used for cooking and as an odorless lamp oil. The thick, sweet milk of female <b>sea</b> <b>cows</b> could be drunk or made into butter, and the thick, leathery hide could be used to make clothing such as shoes and belts and large skin boats sometimes called baidarkas or umiaks.|$|R
5000|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{bones and}} fossils from Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> {{specimens}} were valuable and could be sold to museums for high prices, and most Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> bones were collected during this time; however, collection declined after 1900. Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> bones are still sold commercially, and the highly dense cortical bones of Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cows</b> are well-suited material for decorative items such as knife handles and other carvings.

5000|$|Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cows</b> grew to be 8 to 9 m long as adults, {{much larger}} than extant sirenians. As for weight, Georg Steller's {{writings}} contain two contradictory estimates: 4 and 24.3 MT. The true value is estimated to fall between these figures, at about 8 - 10 MT. This size made the <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> {{one of the largest}} mammals of the Holocene epoch, aside from whales. The <b>sea</b> <b>cow's</b> large size was likely an adaptation to reduce its surface-area-to-volume ratio and conserve heat. Unlike other sirenians, Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> was positively buoyant, meaning that it was unable to completely submerge. It had a very thick outer skin (2.5 cm) to prevent injury from sharp rocks and ice, and possibly to prevent unsubmerged skin from drying out. The <b>sea</b> <b>cow's</b> blubber was 8 - 10 cm thick, another adaptation to the frigid climate of the Bering Sea where it lived. Its skin was brownish-black in color, with white patches on some individuals. It was smooth along its back and rough on its sides, with crater-like depressions most likely caused by parasites. This rough texture led to the animal being nicknamed the [...] "bark animal". Hair on its body was sparse, but the insides of the <b>sea</b> <b>cow's</b> flippers were covered in bristles. The forelimbs were roughly 67 cm long, and the tail fluke was forked.|$|R

5000|$|It {{has also}} been argued that the decline of Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> {{may have been an}} {{indirect}} effect of the harvesting of sea otters by the aboriginal peoples. With the otter population reduced, the number of sea urchins would have increased, in turn reducing availability of kelp, as kelp is also the main food source for sea urchins. Therefore, aboriginal hunting of otters {{may have contributed to the}} <b>sea</b> <b>cow's</b> disappearance from continental shorelines. In historic times, though, aboriginal hunting had depleted sea otter populations only in localized areas, and as the <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> would have been easy prey for aboriginal hunters, accessible populations may have been exterminated with or without simultaneous otter hunting. In any event, the range of the <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> was limited to coastal areas off uninhabited islands by the time Bering arrived, and the animal was already endangered.|$|R
50|$|The <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> {{was named}} for Georg Wilhelm Steller, a naturalist who {{discovered}} the species in 1741. The discovery came on Vitus Bering's Great Northern Expedition when the crew became shipwrecked on Bering Island. Much {{of what is known}} about the behavior of the <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> comes from Steller's observations on the island, documented in his posthumous publication The Beasts of the Sea. Within 27 years of discovery by Europeans, the slow-moving and easily caught Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> was hunted into extinction for its meat, fat, and hide. However, sightings have been claimed after 1768, the recorded year of its extinction.|$|R
40|$|Steller's <b>sea</b> <b>cow,</b> a giant sirenian {{discovered}} in 1741 and extinct by 1768, {{is one of}} the few megafaunal mammal species to have died out during the historical period. The species is traditionally considered to have been exterminated by ‘blitzkrieg’-style direct overharvesting for food, but it has also been proposed that its extinction resulted from a sea urchin population explosion triggered by extirpation of local sea otter populations that eliminated the shallow-water kelps on which <b>sea</b> <b>cows</b> fed. Hunting records from eighteenth century Russian expeditions to the Commander Islands, in conjunction with life-history data extrapolated from dugongs, permit modelling of <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> extinction dynamics. <b>Sea</b> <b>cows</b> were massively and wastefully overexploited, being hunted at over seven times the sustainable limit, and suggesting that the initial Bering Island <b>sea</b> <b>cow</b> population must have been higher than suggested by previous researchers to allow the species to survive even until 1768. Environmental changes caused by sea otter declines are unlikely to have contributed to this extinction event. This indicates that megafaunal extinctions can be effected by small bands of hunters using pre-industrial technologies, and highlights the catastrophic impact of wastefulness when overexploiting resources mistakenly perceived as ‘infinite’...|$|R
