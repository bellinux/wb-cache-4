The seismic performances of steel frame with wedge and ordinary steel frame model under low cycle reciprocating load simulation analysis and time history analysis under earthquake loads are analyzed by using finite element software, compared the respective energy dissipation performance and seismic performance, the results show that the <b>wedge</b> <b>spring</b> damping device can effectively control story drifts of structure, reduce the seismic response of structure, and well consume the seismic energy, so the structure of the new column bases with <b>wedge</b> <b>spring</b> devices show better seismic performance...|$|R
25|$|In July 1919 Wedge {{moved from}} El Paso to Tucson, Arizona {{to begin his}} studies at the University of Arizona. Initially Wedge worked as a {{switchman}} for the Southern Railroad for eight hours each night from midnight. By January 1920 Wedge was employed as a clerk at the Southern Railroad, and lived in a boarding house on East 13th Street, Tucson {{with his wife and}} son. After twelve months at the University, Wedge completed his course requirements and graduated in June 1920 with a Bachelor of Arts degree where he studied Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and the sciences. Wedge was able to speak six languages. In <b>Spring</b> 1921 <b>Wedge's</b> application for admission was accepted to the Graduate School of Education at Harvard University, where he planned to earn a Ph.D. in social and educational psychology. To earn sufficient funds to study at Harvard, Wedge accepted the position as the principal of the Union High School in Benson, Arizona.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{developed}} a parallel multiobjective optimisation methodology to enable fast optimisations of draft gear designs for heavy haul trains. Improvements were {{achieved in the}} development of deterministic white-box draft gear models to enable direct use of the results in product design. Draft gear model parameters such as <b>spring</b> stiffness, <b>wedge</b> angles, and preloads were used as optimisation variables. Two optimisation algorithms were used: Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimisation. All draft gear designs in the optimisations were constrained by impact tests to ensure the optimised designs also comply with current draft gear acceptance standards. Draft gear performance was assessed using whole-trip Longitudinal Train Dynamics (LTD) simulations and coupler fatigue damage calculations. Each simulation covered about 640 km of track and had about 10 hours of operational time. Three optimisation objectives were considered: minimal fatigue damage for wagon connection systems of loaded trains, minimal in-train (coupler) forces for loaded trains, and minimal longitudinal wagon accelerations for empty trains.

60|$|So Rollo {{began to}} examine the log, and {{to look into the}} cracks, {{to see if he could}} find out what it was that made the parts draw {{together}} so hard as to crush the walnut. Presently, he observed that the log was not split open from end to end. The crack commenced at one end, and extended nearly towards the other, but not quite; so that at this other end the log was solid and whole, just as it always had been. So Rollo perceived that the two halves being joined and held together firmly here, they could only be separated at the other end by the <b>wedge</b> <b>springing</b> them open, and, of course, by their elasticity they tended to spring together again. Then besides, he saw, by looking into the crack, a great number of splinters, large and small, which extended obliquely from one side to the other, and bound the two sides strongly towards each other.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{findings from}} a detailed investigation of in-train forces occurring in Aurizon’s coal haulage {{operations in the}} Goonyella region of Central Queensland. The work performed included a significant instrumented wagon based in-train force measurement program, combined with theoretical analysis achieved through computational simulation models. Aurizon’s coal wagons are operated in tandem pairs, each pair having a drawbar connection between the wagons and auto-coupler connections at the outermost ends. A significant change in recent times has been the introduction of short pack draft gears (polymer/elastomer <b>springs</b> without friction <b>wedges)</b> at the drawbar connections. Conventional draft gears are still used at auto-coupler connections. It was found from the detailed analysis of measured in-train forces that changes {{have occurred in the}} system behaviour of contemporary unit train consists as compared to those measured in earlier studies completed in the 1980 ’s and 1990 ’s. In particular, durations and occurrences of low frequency linear vibrations, have been significantly reduced in current consists. The paper provides a comparison of measured data and simulated data from older and more recent mathematical models to allow identification of the factors that have changed low frequency vibration behaviour. The paper provides a valuable update in the understanding of longitudinal dynamics and draft gear modelling...|$|R
40|$|A <b>wedge</b> and <b>spring</b> {{assembly}} {{for use in}} electromagnets or dynamoelectric machines {{having a}} housing with an axis therethrough and a plurality of coils supported on salient poles that extend radially inward from the housing toward the housing axis to define a plurality of interpole spaces, respectively between the housing and adjacent coils, the interpole spaces each extending in a direction generally parallel to the housing axis. The <b>wedge</b> and <b>spring</b> assembly includes a nonmagnetic retainer spring and a nonmagnetic <b>wedge.</b> The retainer <b>spring</b> is formed to fit {{into one of the}} interpole spaces, and has juxtaposed ends defining between them a slit extending in a direction generally parallel to the housing axis. The wedge for insertion into the slit provides an outwardly directed force on respective portions of the juxtaposed ends defining the slit to expand the slit so that respective portions of the retainer spring engage areas of the coils adjacent thereto, thereby resiliently holding the coils against their respective salient poles. Preferably, the <b>spring</b> retainer and <b>wedge</b> are self-locking wherein wedge is fabricated from a material softer than a material the retainer spring is fabricated from, so that the wedge is securely retained in the slit. The retainer spring is generally triangular shaped to fit within the interpole space and fabricated from berryllium-copper alloy, and the wedge is generally T-shaped and fabricated from aluminum. Alternatively, a <b>wedge</b> and <b>spring</b> assembly includes a wedge having divergent sloped surfaces in which each surface and the respective juxtaposed ends of the retainer spring are angled relative to one another so that the wedge is securely retained in the slit by friction existing between its sloped surfaces and the juxtaposed ends of the retaining spring...|$|R
40|$|Permafrost {{regions are}} known to be {{susceptible}} to recent climate warming particularly with regard to positive feedback mechanisms (e. g. by the potential release of stored carbon) from permafrost. However, {{little is known about the}} potential of permafrost ice so called ground ice to store climate and environmental changes. Stable water isotope methods can under certain circumstances reveal climate information from permafrost ice and trace the changes through time. Stable water isotopes (&# 948;D, &# 948; 18 O) are well established as mostly relative paleotemperature proxies for climate studies related to ice caps and glaciers in Greenland, Antarctica and other parts of the world. For permafrost research, the water isotopes have yet been underutilized. Ground ice is defined as all types of ice contained in frozen or freezing ground, including pore ice, segregated ice, as well as ice wedge ice. Ice wedges are most promising as paleoclimate archives. They are distinctive due to their vertically-oriented foliations and air bubbles. Ice wedges form as winter thermal contraction cracks are periodically filled by surface water (mainly from snow melt), which quickly (re) freezes at negative ground temperatures. The seasonality of thermal contraction cracking and of the infill of frost cracks are generally related to winter and <b>spring,</b> respectively. Ice <b>wedges</b> are, thus, assumed to be indicative of winter climate conditions. The processes involved are most likely free of any fractionation during freezing. Segregated ice forms by the process of ice segregation (motion of ground water in the sediment column towards a freezing front). Segregated ice is rather a mixture of winter and summer precipitation, which additionally has undergone fractionation during freezing. One must bear in mind that ground water in permafrost regions is mostly related to the active layer (a sub meter to meter thick layer, which melts in summer and freezes in winter). A third type of ground ice, so called pore ice also known as ice cement, is also intrasedimental ice occurring in the pores of soils, which was formed in situ (without water migration towards a freezing front). This type of ice is typical for relatively coarse-grained sediment. Here, also ground water is the main water source. All these different types of ground ice have a different genetic background, which can be traced by stable isotope methods. This includes the type of water involved (e. g. summer vs. winter precipitation, with relevant isotopic composition) as well as the amount of fractionation occurring during phase transitions in the water cycle. Under favorable conditions (such as minimal fractionation during freezing) the stable isotope composition of these different types of ground ice can be used as paleo archive: (1) for the differentiation of stratigraphical units i. e. Holocene ground ice being generally 3 to 7 heavier in &# 948; 18 O than Pleistocene ground ice, (2) as centennial-scale climate archives for paleotemperature reconstruction as well as indication of (3) changing atmospheric moisture sources from climate-relevant d excess (d excess = &# 948;D- 8 *&# 948; 18 O) records. In this paper, we tackle the potential of the different types of ground ice from Siberian and North American permafrost to trace past climate changes from relative isotope variations in intrasedimental ice to a detailed high-resolution winter climate record from Alaskan ice wedges for the Late Glacial-Holocene transition...|$|R
