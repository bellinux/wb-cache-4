50|$|Black Canyon City {{has been}} known by several names in the past, {{including}} Goddard or Goddards, Cañon, and Black Canyon. Goddard's was a stage stop on the Phoenix to Prescott line, a military stopover en route to Fort Whipple and Fort Verde during Territorial days, and a supply center for mines in the southern Bradshaw Mountains. The area was first settled by Americans in the 1870s, and the first post office was established as Cañon in May 1894, with postmaster Charles E. Goddard, and was discontinued in October 1899. It was reestablished again from February 1903 to November 1906. A famous early settler was Jack Swilling, who moved here in 1871. The walls of his ranch house, <b>Swillings</b> Cabin, the oldest building in the community, still stand.|$|E
2500|$|In 1867, the <b>Swilling's</b> moved once more, {{this time}} to the Salt River Valley. According to an oral history account made by Mrs. Swilling, Mr. Swilling befriended the Lough family near Gillett, near the {{junction}} of the Agua Fria and the New Rivers. The Lough's, who had encountered problems with their wagon and livestock leaving them stranded, received a helping hand from the <b>Swilling's.</b> The Lough family joined the <b>Swilling's</b> {{and headed to the}} Salt River Valley. Mrs. Swilling recalled being the first Mexican women in the Phoenix townsite, and that her friend, [...] "Mrs. Lough" [...] was the first white woman in Phoenix.|$|R

Father Edward Gerard of Florence would often come to Phoenix via a horse-drawn wagon to hold Catholic services at their home.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>Swilling's</b> {{moved to}} Yavapai County and {{established}} a farm at Walnut Grove where he had a claim on Weaver's Mountains.

Mrs. <b>Swilling's</b> mother,Mrs. Mejia, lived with the them until 1865 when she died. [...] On November 11, 1867, Mr. Swilling founded the Swilling Irrigating and Canal Company in Wickenburg.|$|R
50|$|Pima County Sheriff Wiley W. Standefer arrested Swilling and Andrew Kirby, but {{dropped the}} state charges so {{the federal courts}} could prosecute them and absorb the {{prosecution}} costs. Deputy U.S. Marshal Joseph W. Evans brought warrants for the two men to Prescott, where they were turned over to him, and Evans escorted them to the federal jail in Yuma. However, sanitary conditions inside the prison at Yuma were very poor and, combined with the August heat, aggravated <b>Swilling's</b> chronic ill health. He died in his cell on August 12 while awaiting a hearing. The real robbers—led by a man Swilling and others had publicly accused—were identified only after <b>Swilling’s</b> death.|$|R

50|$|Swilling {{was buried}} in a Yuma {{cemetery}} before his family could be notified. The location of his grave is unknown. After his death, <b>Swilling’s</b> reputation as a badman grew so fast {{that by the end}} of the 19th century a prominent Arizona historian described him as a “typical desperado.” By many accounts he was a joker and yarn spinner and while drinking he spread tall tales about his exploits to all who would listen. Friends remembered Jack Swilling as an honest, hard-working, and generous man always ready to help those in need of a meal or a place to sleep. He was known to put his own life at risk for others, literally riding to the rescue when help was needed in the face of Apache attack. In the end, his use of a combination of narcotics and liquor to relieve the pain caused by old injuries ruined Jack <b>Swilling’s</b> health and led indirectly to his death.|$|R

25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1878, word reached the <b>Swilling's</b> that Colonel Jacob Snively, a family friend, {{had been killed by}} the Apaches in the Wickenburg Mountains near the peak called White Picacho.

50|$|The {{years between}} <b>Swilling’s</b> arrival in Arizona in 1858 and the {{founding}} of Phoenix almost a decade later were active and varied ones. After his arrival in Arizona, Swilling moved to southern California, where he joined in a gold rush near Los Angeles. A few months later he was drawn back to Arizona by the gold rush at Gila City, where he also worked for the Butterfield Overland Mail Company.|$|R
50|$|<b>Swilling's</b> {{war ended}} {{there and he}} {{convinced}} Joseph Walker and his group that there was gold in the central highlands of the new Arizona Territory. He then guided them to where the first Yavapai County mining district was formed, {{just a few miles}} south of present-day Prescott, on May 10, 1863. The expedition called it the Pioneer Mining District, and the rules they adopted were the area’s first recorded laws.|$|R
50|$|Swilling was a {{professional}} football player from 1986 to 1998. In 2001, he won a special election as a Democrat to the Louisiana House for District 100 in New Orleans. He served for three years with assignments on House Education, Retirement, and Transportation committees. He lost his bid for a full term as representative in the 2003 runoff election to his fellow Democrat Austin Badon, who polled 6,688 votes (53.3 percent) to <b>Swilling's</b> 5,851 (46.7 percent).|$|R
50|$|Swilling {{left the}} Walker party {{shortly after the}} {{formation}} of the Pioneer Mining District and joined up with the exploratory party of Pauline Weaver and Abraham Harlow Peeples (1842-1892), which arrived in the area shortly after the Walker group. He made a small fortune from the unusual surface gold mine at Rich Hill between Wickenburg and Prescott. News of his successes spread eastward when two gold samples from <b>Swilling’s</b> claim sent to General James Henry Carleton were forwarded for presentation to President Abraham Lincoln.|$|R

2500|$|The Swilling Irrigating and Canal Company {{founded by}} Mrs. <b>Swilling's</b> (as Escalante was {{referred}} to) husband had 16 investors which included Phillip Darrell Duppa (known as Lord Duppa) and Bryan Phillips.

The canal diverted water from the Salt River to irrigate farm lands in what would eventually become the town of Phoenix. The canal, which became known as [...] "Swillings Ditch" [...] was successful. It should be noted that in 1884, the Joint Head Dam was built in the location where Jack Swilling began to build his ditch and where the Salt River is located.|$|R
25|$|Pima County Sheriff Wiley W. Standefer arrested Mr. Swilling and Andrew Kirby. They were {{eventually}} {{turned over to}} Deputy U.S. Marshal Joseph W.

5000|$|John William [...] "Jack" [...] Swilling {{was born}} on April 1, 1830, at Red House Plantation, Anderson, South Carolina, to George Swilling and Margaret Farrar Swilling, the eighth of their 10 children. George Swilling {{was the son of}} the {{plantation}} manager, while Margaret Farrar's father,Thomas Farrar, was the owner. (Incidentally, Thomas Farrar's mother was Judith Jefferson, the sister of Peter Jefferson and aunt to the third president, Thomas Jefferson.) Farrar's parents did not approve of the marriage, so the young couple eloped. It took three years for her parents to accept the match. In time, George Swilling became owner of the plantation. When Jack Swilling was 14, the family moved from South Carolina to Georgia. Three years later he and an older brother enlisted in a mounted battalion of Georgia volunteers for service during the Mexican-American War. After the war, the two young men returned to Georgia. Jack <b>Swilling's</b> whereabouts are unknown for a brief time afterwards, although he was reported in Georgia for the Christmas of 1849.|$|R
50|$|On one {{occasion}} Wickenburg had noticed a quartz ledge about fourteen miles from group's camp. His observation was {{ignored by the}} others. Wickenburg went by himself to investigate the quartz ledge and believed that the ledge had potential. He returned to the camp and told his associates. A claim was staked by Wickenburg and his associates; A. Van Bibber, J.B. Green, W. Smith and N.K. Estil. His associates continued to seek other ventures and Wickenburg worked the mine by himself and began to sell the gold ore to other prospectors. He established an encampment which he named Wickenburg's Ranch. Wickenburg helped to finance Jack <b>Swilling's</b> Ditch Project, which later became the Salt River Project. By 1866, Wickenburg {{had had enough of}} gold mining and sold the 80% interest of the Vulture mine which he owned, for eighty-five thousand US dollars ($85,000). He received twenty thousand in cash and a promissory note {{for the rest of the}} sixty-five thousand dollars. The new owners refused to pay him because they claimed that Wickenburg did not have a clear title to the property. The Vulture was the most important gold mine in Arizona.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper was}} due to be {{presented}} to the 2013 conference of the World Association for Political Economy, in Florianopolis, Brasil. In the event, the author was unable to attend. The paper summarises the main conclusions of ten years of research into the Creative Industries in London and the UK, culminating in a report for the English-based research foundation NESTA. The author was responsible for this research. I try to draw out the policy conclusions for economic and human development addressing three fundamental structural problems: (1) 	In what technologies should a modernising, developmental strategy focus? (2) 	What is the relation between economic and human development and how can the latter be assured by the course of the first? 	 (3) 	What technological and social choices will make it possible both to expand economic activity and to reduce the consumption of resources, with all the attendant risks that beset modern development strategies including dependency on resource exploitation and the sustainability of the chosen growth path 	 With few notable exceptions, social theory has failed to grasp the significance of the Creative Industries, consigning to a backwater a development which offers answers to the economic crisis, the social problems of a deeply unequal world, and to resource depletion and rape. Culture has become a ‘non-economic’ opposite to political economy; neither economists nor cultural theorists grasp the theoretical instruments needed to understand that culture is in fact the most economically important human activity, once the economy is grasped, in a rounded way, to include the whole of social reproduction. The principal obstacle to theoretical and practical advance is the inheritance, both material and spiritual, of a fading epoch dominated by mechanisation. The primary course of present-day accumulation is to reduce labour to a simple mechanical form, and then replace humans by machines. The primary drive of culture is the opposite. The creative industries show that the present course of economic development is bumping up against absolute limits. This is because the resource that they require to grow is non-mechanical labour, which cannot be replaced by machinery. The normal mechanism of accumulation – the acquisition of material and hence excludable ‘things’ no longer works. They also illustrate a fundamental limit in the structure of demand. The source of demand for cultural products is a mix of the luxury consumption of the capitalists, and the ‘moral’ or socially-defined component of the wage, both of which are primarily non-material. As the world passes material satiety and lurches into material overconsumption, even as it consigns three quarters of its population to absolute deprivation, new material sources of demand are impossible to find, and new private demand is increasingly confined to the cultural and spiritual domain, where it takes the morbid forms of lust to possess, dominate and outdo. These trends between them offer a sustainable path forward for humanity in the shape of growth in demand for labour services, which would be, in Mark <b>Swilling’s</b> terminology, ‘resource-decoupled’, decreasing the consumption of resources whilst growing the use and emancipatory nature of human labour. The paper will address the fundamental obstacles to realising this, including those created by a mode of production so far unable to transition from investing in things to invest in humans. This poses an especial challenge for policy, since the growth of the creative industry sector manifests itself in a new and vibrant commercial sector, yet depends on long-term investment in both in the artistic and cultural formation of performers and producers, and in the general cultural level of society, including careful attention to the changed role of urban spaces and the interaction between cultural activity and new technology. This paper is based on a lecture given to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in November 2012. It builds on a substantial and scientifically well-grounded body of international research, which is now beginning to receive some serious attention in policy circles, by drawing out the above vital conclusions, and demonstrating their scientific validity.
