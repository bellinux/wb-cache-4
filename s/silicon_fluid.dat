40|$|The major {{contributions}} of this thesis are the developments of silicon micromachined flow shear-stress sensors and magnetic actuators, together with original studies on two fundamental issues of micro fabrication. Sensors and actuators applications in two fluid-mechanics {{projects have been}} successfully demonstrated. Micro shear-stress sensors utilize boundary-layer thermal transfer principles. For the proposed fluid-mechanics applications these sensors must have higher sensitive compared with conventional sensors, among other requirements. This has been realized by implementing a unique vacuum-sealed cavity which greatly reduces heat loss to the substrate <b>silicon.</b> <b>Fluid</b> applications present unique challenges to micromachined actuators: they must achieve large out-of-plane motion and withstand large forces. We have developed two types of magnetic actuators that fit these requirements. The first type is based on interaction between the magnetic dipole moment of a current-carrying coil and an external magnetic field. A second-type uses the torque generated by an electroplated Permalloy (Ni[subscript 80]Fe[subscript 20] plate inside an external magnetic field. The two fundamental micro-fabrication issues are the reactive sealing of cavities and the magnetic-levitation assisted release of surface structures. We have conducted systematic experiments to determine the dependance of sealing performance on the test- structure geometric parameters, sealing materials and other factors. Release/drying of micro actuators, with their large surface areas, is especially challenging. The idea for magnetic-levitation assisted release is obtained while we were developing the Permalloy magnetic actuator. Magnetic forces counteract the surface tension forces during the drying to avoid structure stiction to the substrate. Original results from these fundamental studies add to the general micromachining knowledge base. The applications of developed sensors and actuators are demonstrated in two fluid- mechanics projects. In the first, we explore a unique scheme for active drag reduction, which is possible only by using a Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS). The MEMS consists of an array of shear-stress sensors, actuators and embedded neural-network (NN) circuitry. The goal of the second project is to achieve enhanced maneuverability of delta-wings using MEMS devices. Shear-stress sensors are successfully applied to identify the flow separation lines along the delta-wing's leading edges. Permalloy magnetic actuators interact with the leading-edge flow for controlling the wing motion. ...|$|E

The computational domain includes solid <b>silicon</b> and <b>fluid</b> regions. The fluid region consists of a microchannel with a hydraulic diameter of 85. 58 ?m. Independent parameters that were varied {{in this study are}} channel aspect ratio and Reynolds number. The aspect ratios range from 0. 10 to 1. 0 and Reynolds number ranges from 50 to 400. A constant heat flux of 90 W/cm 2 is applied to the northern face of the computational domain, which simulates thermal energy generation from an integrated circuit. A simplified model is validated against analytical fully developed flow results and a grid independence study is performed for the complete model. The numerical results for apparent friction coefficient and convective thermal resistance at the channel inlet and exit for the 0. 317 aspect ratio are compared with the experimental data. The numerical results closely match the experimental data. This close matching lends credibility to this method for predicting flows and temperatures of water and the silicon substrate in microchannels. Apparent friction coefficients linearly increase with Reynolds number, which is explained by increased entry length for higher Reynolds number flows. The mean temperature of water in the microchannels also linearly increases with channel length after a short thermal entry region. Inlet and outlet thermal resistance values monotonically decrease with increasing Reynolds number and increase with increasing aspect ratio.

Although {{the temperature of the}} molten glass has to decrease by several hundred degrees in the forehearth, the temperature distribution in the outlet section must be uniform. Due to the extremely convoluted character of the flow pattern, it is difficult to suggest the design rules and operational procedures that will ensure this uniformity without resorting to detailed experimental and numerical studies.

40|$|Photovoltaic {{manufacturing}} is material intensive {{with the}} cost of crystalline silicon wafer, used as the substrate, representing 40 % to 60 % of the solar cell cost. Consequently, there is a growing trend to reduce the silicon wafer thickness leading to new technical challenges related to manufacturing. Specifically, wafer breakage during handling and/or transfer is a significant issue. Therefore improved methods for breakage-free handling are needed to address this problem. An important pre-requisite for realizing such methods is the need for fundamental understanding of the effect of handling device variables on the deformation, stresses, and fracture of crystalline silicon wafers. This knowledge is lacking for wafer handling devices including the Bernoulli gripper, which is an air flow nozzle based device. A computational fluid dynamics model of the air flow generated by a Bernoulli gripper has been developed. This model predicts the air flow, pressure distribution and lifting force generated by the gripper. For thin <b>silicon</b> wafers, the <b>fluid</b> model is combined with a finite element model to analyze the effects of wafer flexibility on the equilibrium pressure distribution, lifting force and handling stresses. The effect of wafer flexibility on the air pressure distribution is found to be increasingly significant at higher air flow rates. The model yields considerable insight into the relative effects of air flow induced vacuum and the direct impingement of air on the wafer on the air pressure distribution, lifting force, and handling stress. The latter effect is found to be especially significant when the wafer deformation is large. In addition to silicon wafers, the model {{can also be used to}} determine the lifting force and handling stress produced in other flexible materials. Finally, a systematic approach for the analysis of the total stress state (handling plus residual stresses) produced in crystalline silicon wafers and its impact on wafer breakage during handling is presented. Results confirm the capability of the approach to predict wafer breakage during handling given the crack size, location and fracture toughness. This methodology is general and can be applied to other thin wafer handling devices besides the Bernoulli gripper. Ph. D.

This cycle uses heat sources with low temperatures (100 – 500  °C). The ORC cycle works based on the simple Rankine cycle; however, to work with organic fluids, some changes must be applied. Organic working fluid in the ORC could be selected from the hydrocarbons; however, inorganic materials such as <b>silicon</b> and refrigeration <b>fluids</b> can also be used. ORC technology is significantly used in waste heat recycling of waste heat from gas turbines and it has significant advantages compared to classical heat regenerator system using a conventional Rankine cycle [12, 19]. A great deal of {{research has been done}} in the field of organic Rankine cycle. Yamamato et al. [23] examined an organic Rankine cycle using HCFC- 123 as a working fluid and concluded that this system has a better performance compared to using water as the working fluid [23]. Liu et al. [10] studied the effects of different working fluid on thermal and heat regenerator efficiencies. It showed that the wet fluid is inappropriate for ORC systems [10]. Wei et al. [22] studied the analysis and optimization of organic Rankine cycle using (1, 1, 1, 3, 3 penta-fluoro-propane) HFC-FA 245 as the working fluid. The results showed that the use of the output heat is a good solution to improve the system efficiency and net output power. The condenser outlet cooling degree should be small (0.5 – 0.6  K). When the ambient temperature is high, system output power and efficiency was reduced about 30 % from the nominal value. [22]. Saleh et al.

40|$|Capacitive micromachined {{ultrasonic}} transducer (CMUT) has been emerging technology {{in the field of}} medical imaging after its first demonstration in early 90 s. CMUTs are fabricated on silicon substrates using micromachining techniques. They can generate high frequencies due to the smaller dimensions feasible with microfabrication. CMUTs for immersion applications could be easily designed to provide fractional bandwidths exceeding 100 %. Therefore, they are promising for applications like intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) where high resolution is required at short range. In this domain it may perform better than the existing piezoelectric ultrasound transducers. But there are certain issues that need {{to be taken care of}} before they can be used as commercial ultrasound transducers. One is echoes due to the acoustic wave propagation in the silicon substrate, and another is resonances caused by cross coupling between the neighboring elements in the CMUT arrays. In this thesis we investigate an acoustic backing structure that is to be added on the back side of the CMUT. The backing should absorb incident acoustic waves across a wide frequency band, and it must effectively suppress structural resonances and vibrations. To achieve this, the backing of a CMUT should have an acoustic impedance that matches with the silicon substrate, and it should be lossy. A good candidate for the backing is a tungsten filled epoxy. If the backing structure is thick enough, it will absorb the acoustic wave reflected back to the transducer and thus will remove any trailing echoes. In many cases the transducer is intended for applications where there is little room for a thick backing. Various approaches has been suggested to reduce the extra volume and weight added by a thick absorbing backing, one approach is to use a grooved backing structure. The grooves at the bottom of the backing provide an extra attenuation by scattering the waves in different directions so that a thinner backing would be sufficient. The scattering removes power from the specular reflection from the back surface which otherwise degrades the image quality. It has been shown that this type of structure reduces the specular reflection for a range of frequencies. When CMUTs are used in practical applications, the propagation of waves from a fluid medium into the backing or vice versa is blocked to some degree by total reflection, except for a range of steering angles around broadside. This is due to the difference in acoustic velocities of <b>silicon</b> and the <b>fluid</b> medium. This blocking is accompanied by the generation of surface waves in the silicon substrate, which also may impact the imaging and therefore must be controlled. In the present work we investigate the acoustic signal transmitted into the backing relative to the signal transmitted into the fluid medium when CMUT arrays on top of the silicon substrate are excited. This gives us an estimation of how much attenuation is needed from the acoustic backing layer. The purpose of the grooves on the backing structure is to provide an attenuation due to scattering which is in addition to the absorption loss in the epoxy tungsten composite. Experiments performed on the grooved backing structures show that such structures provide a satisfactory performance for the waves traveling normal to the bottom of the backing structure. But the acoustic waves propagating into the backing structure may not always be normal to the bottom of the structure. Therefore, the performance of the grooved backing structure is also studied for the waves traveling in oblique directions to the bottom surface of the backing. From our simulations we know that the performance of grooved structures for oblique incidence is not significantly different from that of normal incidence when the incident angle is within ± 30 ◦ to the surface normal to the bottom of the structure. We have also shown that for a CMUT-backing stack immersed in a fluid medium, waves that reach into the backing from the fluid medium with significant power mostly lie within this range of angles. It means that a CMUT transducer with grooved backing structure always provide extra attenuation for the waves propagating into the substrates when it is used in practical applications. In this work we have also investigated acoustic properties of some polymers. The polymers, RTV 615 and Sylgard 160, have acoustic properties such that a thin layer of these polymers could be used to minimize the acoustic cross coupling in the CMUT arrays significantly. These materials could also be used as lens material for CMUT transducers together with stiff polymers such as TPX. PhD i elektronikk og telekommunikasjonPhD in Electronics and Telecommunicatio...|$|R
40|$|Wall-Pressure {{fluctuations}} {{beneath a}} {{turbulent boundary layer}} are a key issue in studies of the boundary layer dynamics. The pressure fluctuations are coupled to the velocity fluctuations via complex interactions with the mean shear {{as well as with}} the velocity fluctuations themselves. These phenomena have been studied theoretically as well as experimentally, and reviews of earlier work can be found in e. g. Blake (1986). From an experimental point of view the pressure fluctuations in turbulence flow is far from being as comprehensive as that of the velocity fluctuations. In case of all wall-pressure fluctuations, where a pressure transducer is mounted flush on the surface, some general facts have been proposed like the order of magnitude of the pressure fluctuation and a general form of the power spectrum. However, one main criticism may be raised about these experiments, namely that the size of the pressure the transducer was employed. A large transducer attenuates the small scale high frequency components of the pressure signals due to spatial and temporal averaging. The introduction of <b>silicon</b> technology into <b>fluid</b> dynamics offers new possibilities in the design of extremely small sensors for the study of turbulent phenomena. A first generation of small silicon based pressure transducers was developed and tested by Löfdahl et al. (1993). Important issues were to find a reliable method to detect the diaphragm deflection and to take into consideration the handling of a sensor with a diaphragm thickness of less than one micron. The present paper is based on further development second generation pressure transducers, which are fabricated employing more complex and sophisticated methods, yielding even smaller sensors and thereby an increased spatial and temporal resolution. A classic way to detect pressure fluctuations is to use cavity covered with a diaphragm, where a stable static pressure is maintained on one side of the diaphragm, while the other side is exposed to the fluctuations. The deflection of a diaphragm is a measure of the fluctuations, and can be detected in many ways. In accordance with the results of Löfdahl et al. (1993), the diaphragm deflection is detected by two resistors located on the diaphragm. Two additional resistors are integrated close to the diaphragm making it possible to connect the four resistors into a temperature insensitive Wheatstone bridge. All sensors are equipped with a vent channel starting at the cavity and emerging at the opposite side of the chip. Figure 1 shows a principal drawing of the second generation of pressure transducers. The different parts such as the diaphragm, polysilicon, piezoresistive gauges, conductors, vent channel and bonding pads are clearly indicated in the figure. The side lengths of the diaphragms are 100 and 300 μm, respectively and the thickness is 0. 4 μm. All measurements were carried out in a closed low-speed wind tunnel. In the horizontal symmetry plane of the test section (1. 25 m x 1. 80 m x 3. 00 m), a flat plate of 2. 5 m lengths was positioned. The present experiments were all carried out in a cross-section of the flat plate at a distance of approximately 1. 5 m from the leading edge. In this cross-section, the boundary layer thickness, δ, was in the range of 27 to 39 mm and the friction velocity, ___, was determined to be 0. 235 to 1. 390 m/s, respectively. In Figure 2, the probability density distribution of the pressure amplitudes are shown for the diaphragm side lengths of 100 and 300 μm. The distribution is normalized so that the area underneath the curve is unity. As is shown, a decreasing diaphragm size is associated with a shrinking peak and a continuous expansion in the probability distribution, i. e. a wider distribution capturing more of the larger pressure amplitudes. The 300 μm transducer revealed a slightly more peaked distribution. To elucidate the influence of the diaphragms size of the measured fluctuating pressure, the rms value is plotted as a function of the wall unit, ___. This is shown in Figure 3. The quantity, ___ is again interpreted as an intensity of the fluctuating pressure, and it is clearly shown in Figure 3 that the 100 μm sensor is capable of capturing higher values of the fluctuating pressures. Thus the 100 μm sensor resolves the smallest eddies, spatially and temporally, better than the 300 μm sensor. A physical interpretation of this might be that the larger sensor attenuates and integrates eddies with a length scale less than a certain threshold value, while the smaller transducer is capable of resolving these eddies, see Blake (1986), and Ligrani & Bradshaw (1987) for a corresponding discussion on hot-wires. An estimate of this threshold value might be obtained for the present experimental set up. As seen in Figure 3, the fitted curves are converging at approximately 10 ___. implying that pressure fluctuations associated with a length scale less than this value can not be separated. Interpreting this a measure of the threshold value, it is interesting to know that 10 wall units is approximately 125 μm for the present flat plate flow case, and the determined threshold value hence is about two times the estimated Kolmogorov scale for the flat plate boundary layer. In the full paper, the wall pressure correlation coefficient as a function of dimensionless time delay and longitudinal spatial separation will be shown. Four transducers have been used in a squared array to accomplish a contour map of the longitudinal space time correlation, similar to the map of Willmarth & Woolridge (1962), and the local advection speed of the pressure producing eddies for various frequency bands is determined. Here it is worthwhile to point out that the ratio of the transducer diameter to boundary layer thickness of Willmarth & Woolridge (1962) was of the order 1 / 30, while this ratio is 1 / 300 for present work...|$|R
