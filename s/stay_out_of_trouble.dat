5|$|On Saturday February 24, 2007 {{at about}} 6:55a.m., Brown's Chevrolet Equinox {{was stolen from}} an on-street parking {{location}} by someone with key access and crashed into three parked vehicles before being abandoned {{a few blocks from}} the family home. Brown had driven his son to play in a basketball tournament in Jamestown, New York on Friday February 23. They returned home at approximately 10:30p.m. from the tournament. In interviews at the end of March 2007, Brown claimed that all members of his family with known key access had alibis. At the time Brown III possessed a learner's permit. Canisius College security cameras recorded parts of the accident, including the driver leaving the scene of multiple accidents. In April a second video recording with more fluid movement was revealed in contrast to the original recording of 36 frames per minute. In a news conference Brown announced that Byron Brown III took the senior Brown's car without permission and drove about the area near his house and Canisius College campus. Brown III admitted to the damage and was charged with driving without a driver's license and leaving the scenes of multiple accidents. Brown III was scheduled to appear on April 16, 2007 in Buffalo City Court on the charges. He pleaded guilty to unlicensed driving and leaving the scene of an accident. In 2010, his son was charged with petit larceny for leaving a store with goods that were not paid for. Byron Jr. was spared a criminal conviction when a judge granted him a delayed dismissal on shoplifting charges, as recommended by prosecutors. Buffalo City Judge David M. Manz warned him and Xavier Jemison that they have to complete a four-hour shoplifting class and <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> for the next six months. He granted each an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal, meaning their petit larceny charges will be dismissed if they comply with his orders.|$|E

25|$|French General Pierre Jadart Dumerbion {{commanded}} the Army of Italy. Competent but old, {{he had seen}} too many generals sent to the guillotine for failing or for having the wrong political views. Two of his predecessors suffered this fate, Brunet on 15 November 1793 and Biron on 31 December 1793. In order to <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble,</b> Dumerbion determined to consult the all-powerful Representatives on mission before acting. At this time, the representatives were Augustin Robespierre and Antoine Christophe Saliceti and both were influenced by freshly-promoted General of Brigade Napoleon Bonaparte, the army's new artillery chief. Bonaparte drew up a strategic plan and Dumerbion listened. Bonaparte planned to launch a drive northeast along the coast to capture Oneglia, a nest of Sardinian privateers that preyed on the Genoa-to-Nice grain trade. From Oneglia, the French would turn north to seize Ormea, outflanking the enemy's defenses from the east. While these moves were implemented, the main army would distract the Coalition defenders by advancing directly on Saorge. Of Dumerbion's 43,000-man field army, 20,000 men formed the attacking force, divided into three columns and a reserve.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{government}} crackdown, Polanco-Rodriguez escaped arrest in New York by fleeing to the Dominican Republic with a fake passport. However, {{he was unable}} to <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble.</b> He was shot in the leg during a gunfight over a woman in a Santiago nightclub. United States officials insisted that the Dominican government either extradite or imprison him. He was arrested in 1988 and sent to La Victoria prison without a trial. After fighting with other prisoners, Polanco-Rodriguez was transferred to the Monte Plata jail in 1990, where he bribed guards to allow him certain luxuries. But once again Polanco-Rodriguez became involved in an intense struggle with inmates when he stopped the attempted rape of a female prisoner. Fellow prisoners attempted to burn him alive by setting his cell cot on fire. Finally, in 1992, prison authorities released him. He is married to a woman named Johani Candelario, daughter of Renato Candelario, and is the father of five children. In an interview with The New York Times in 1996, Polanco-Rodriguez said he had retired from his life of crime, and DEA and Dominican drug officials said they have no evidence to the contrary.|$|E

500|$|Her father {{suffered}} from multiple sclerosis {{which had a}} profound emotional effect on her as she was growing up. She was determined to <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> and be a good student, which was what her father wanted for her. By sixth grade, Michelle joined a gifted class at Bryn Mawr Elementary School (later renamed Bouchet Academy). She attended Whitney Young High School, Chicago's first magnet high school, established as a selective enrollment school, where she was a classmate of Jesse Jackson's daughter Santita. The round-trip commute from the Robinsons' South Side home to the Near West Side, where the school was located, took three hours. She recalled being fearful of how others would perceive her, but disregarded any negativity around her and used it [...] "to fuel me, to keep me going." [...] She recalled experiencing gender discrimination growing up, saying, for example, that rather than asking her for her opinion on a given subject, people commonly tended to ask what her older brother thought. She was on the honor roll for four years, took advanced placement classes, {{was a member of}} the National Honor Society, and served as student council treasurer. She graduated in 1981 as the salutatorian of her class.|$|E
500|$|Among the prisoners, Seaman First Class Joseph Randolph [...] "Joe" [...] Small, a winch {{operator}} in Division Four and a natural leader who called cadence when his division marched, {{was asked by}} officers to assemble a handful of reliable men as a team of acting petty officers {{and to keep the}} other prisoners on good behavior. On August 10, there had been conflicts between the prisoners and their guards as the prisoners were marched to the mess hall for meals. There was also a brief fight in the mess hall, and some prisoners were seen sharpening spoons into makeshift knives. Small sensed a general air of rebelliousness among the prisoners. To counteract the rising tension and offset the disaster he saw coming, Small convened a short meeting that evening aboard the crowded barge and told the prisoners to [...] "knock off the horseplay", <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> and obey the shore patrol guards (who were black) and the officers, because the alternative (white Marines as guards) would be worse. He said to the men, [...] "We've got the officers by the ballsthey can do nothing to us if we don't do anything to them. If we stick together, they can't do anything to us." ...|$|E

50|$|In {{the state}} of New York, a similar process is known as {{adjournment}} in contemplation of dismissal (ACOD).

Although Fazenda attempted to help him, after she was diagnosed with a nervous breakdown her husband pronounced many of her former friends – including Bunker – personae non-gratae in the Wallis household. Bunker held down various jobs for a while, including that of a used car salesman, but eventually returned to crime. He orchestrated robberies (without personally taking part in them), forged checks, and engaged in other criminal activities.|$|E
2500|$|Phillips, {{a native}} of the North Central section of Detroit, Michigan, grew up in a rough neighborhood.

2500|$|After a short {{stint at}} Denman Junior High School, Garcia {{attended}} tenth grade at Balboa High School in 1958, where he often {{got into trouble}} for skipping classes and fighting. Consequently, in 1959, Garcia's mother again moved the family to get Garcia to <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble,</b> this time to Cazadero, {{a small town in}} Sonoma County, 90miles north of San Francisco. This turn of events did not sit well with Garcia. To get to Analy High School, the nearest school, he had to travel by bus thirty miles to Sebastopol, a move which only made him more unhappy. Garcia did, however, join a band at his school known as the Chords. After performing and winning a contest, the band's reward was recording a song—they chose [...] "Raunchy" [...] by Bill Justis.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding education, she said, [...] "While {{it might}} be popular, it is not {{demanding}} to set standards that all students can meet right away....

[...] She supported [...] "giving local schools control of [...] new education dollars... expanding after-school and weekend class programs... and supports reading and math specialists." [...] She opposed vouchers. “In 2005, she signed legislation creating the Student Excellence Equals Degree (SEED) Scholarship program, which enables students who keep their grades up and <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> to go to college for free in the state of Delaware.

2500|$|Berlin Alexanderplatz {{centers on}} Franz Biberkopf, a former convict and minor pimp, {{who tries to}} <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> but is dragged down by crime, poverty and the duplicity of those around him. His best friend, Reinhold, makes him lose an arm and murders Franz' prostitute girlfriend, Mieze. The love {{triangle}} of Franz, Reinhold and Mieze is staged against {{the rising tide of}} Nazism in Germany. The film emphasized the sadomasochist relationship between Biberkopf and Reinhold [...] stressing its homoerotic nature. Fassbinder had read the book at age fourteen; later claiming that it helped him survive a [...] "murderous puberty". The influence of Döblin's novel can be seen in many of Fassbinder's films most of whose protagonists are named Franz, some with the surname Biberkopf like the naïve working class lottery winner in Fox and his friends, [...] who is played by Fassbinder. He also took the pseudonym of Franz Walsch for his work as editor on his own films: Walsch was an oblique homage to director Raoul Walsh.|$|E
2500|$|At the time, police morale was low {{and petty}} criminals who {{committed}} misdemeanors were not being arrested.

For years, therefore, the key to career success in the NYPD, as in many bureaucratic leviathans, was to shun risk and avoid failure. Accordingly, cops became more cautious as they rose in rank, {{right up to the}} highest levels." [...] The city government did not implement broken windows theory at first, and the allowance of low-profile crime was thought by some at the time to have caused more high-profile crimes to occur. Formerly elegant movie theaters began to show porn, and hustlers were common. The area was so abandoned at one point during the time that the entire Times Square area paid the city only $6 million in property taxes, which is less than what a medium-sized office building in Manhattan typically would produce in tax revenue today in 1984 dollars.|$|E
2500|$|They soon realized, however, that Parker had the {{possibility}} of becoming quite a successful model. Soon thereafter, Parker would become the most successful model of the 1950s, helping push the Ford's agency to number one. In the 1940s and 1950s, the Fords represented top models Mary Jane Russell, Carmen Dell'Orefice, and Dovima. By 1954, the Fords were extremely successful and {{were living in a}} duplex apartment on Park Avenue. To make sure that their models were the most successful, the Fords provided hair dressers, dermatologists, and Eileen dispensed diet advice constantly. She allowed models to live with her to [...] "keep a close eye on them so they'd <b>stay</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> and make their early morning appointments." [...] Eleven (11) of Ford's busiest models were featured on the April 1955 issue of McCall's magazine (Parker, Leigh, Jean Patchett, Patsy Shally, Lillian Marcuson, Nan Rees, Leonie Vernet, Georgia Hamilton, Dolores Hawkins, Kathy Dennis, and Mary Jane Russell). Ford pushed for standardized hours and wages. She enforced rules about what models could and could not do (for example, showing “excessive amounts of bosom” in a photo was a no-no).|$|E
