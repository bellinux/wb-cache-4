5|$|A fire {{swept through}} Westminster in 1834, {{destroying}} {{most of the}} old palace, but the Jewel Tower, which was separated from the main fire and was positioned away from the prevailing wind, survived, along with its <b>store</b> <b>of</b> records from the House of Lords. Westminster was rebuilt, and in 1864 substantial changes were made at the tower: the Parliamentary records in the tower were moved to a fire-proof storage facility at the new Victoria Tower; 6–7 Old Palace Yard ceased {{to be used by}} the clerk as a house, and the kitchen in the ground floor of the tower was closed. Around this time, the tower began to be called the Jewel Tower once again, partially in the incorrect belief that it had held the Crown Jewels during the medieval period.|$|E

5|$|Several British retail chains regard their Oxford Street branch as the {{flagship}} store. Debenhams originally opened as Marshall & Snelgrove in 1870; in 1919 they merged with Debenhams, which had opened in nearby Wigmore Street in 1778. The company {{was owned by}} Burton between 1985 and 1998. The London flagship <b>store</b> <b>of</b> the House of Fraser began as D H Evans in 1879 and moved to its current premises in 1935. It was the first department store in the UK with escalators serving every floor. Selfridges, Oxford Street, the second-largest department store in the UK and flagship of the Selfridges chain, has been in Oxford Street since 1909.|$|E
5|$|The {{generation}} of ATP by the mitochondrion from cytosolic NADH {{relies on the}} malate-aspartate shuttle (and to a lesser extent, the glycerol-phosphate shuttle) because the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH and NAD+. Instead of transferring the generated NADH, a malate dehydrogenase enzyme converts oxaloacetate to malate, which is translocated to the mitochondrial matrix. Another malate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction occurs in the opposite direction, producing oxaloacetate and NADH from the newly transported malate and the mitochondrion's interior <b>store</b> <b>of</b> NAD+. A transaminase converts the oxaloacetate to aspartate for transport back across the membrane and into the intermembrane space.|$|E
5|$|When the American Revolutionary War {{broke out}} in 1775, Lord Dunmore, the British provincial {{governor}} of the Colony of Virginia, with the British forces under his command, had removed Virginia's <b>store</b> <b>of</b> provincial arms and gunpowder to the island of New Providence in the Crown Colony of the Bahamas, {{in order to keep}} it from falling {{into the hands of the}} rebel militia. Montfort Browne, the Bahamian governor, was alerted by General Thomas Gage in August 1775 that the rebel colonists might make attempts to seize these supplies.|$|E

5|$|A {{contingent}} of 250 National Guard engineering units occupied {{one part of}} the convention center beginning August 30 and remained there until September 1, at times barricaded in their location. The units were never given orders to control the crowd, and were not expected to be prepared for such a task, as engineering units. The number of people at the convention center continued to grow over the next three days by some estimates to as many as 20,000people. Reasons for arriving included being sent to the convention center from the overwhelmed Superdome, being dropped off there by rescuers, or hearing about the convention center as a shelter via word of mouth. No checking for weapons was done among the crowd as was done at the Superdome, and a large <b>store</b> <b>of</b> alcohol kept at the Convention Center was looted. Reports of robberies, murder, and rape began to surface. In general, those who died, regardless of cause of death, were not moved or removed and were left to decompose.|$|E
5|$|Although much {{is known}} of Little's {{investment}} activities in his adult life, {{little is known about}} his early years. Jacob Little was born in Newburyport, Massachusetts on March 17, 1794. The son of a successful local shipbuilder and of Quaker origin, Little exhibited a strong understanding of money and financial markets from an early age. In 1817 he emigrated to New York City and became a clerk in the <b>store</b> <b>of</b> Jacob Barker, a highly successful financier, merchant, and politically well-connected founding member of the Democratic Party political machine Tammany Hall. Little spent five years in apprenticeship under Barker before moving out in 1822 to start his own business with $700 he had accrued over the length of his employment. He bought a small office {{in the basement of a}} Wall Street building, which served as his base of operations for the next twelve years, before moving out of his old office to a new one in the basement of the old exchange building in 1834, from which he opened a brokerage—the start of his investment career.|$|E
5|$|At first Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang {{is just a}} big and {{powerful}} car, but as the book progresses the car surprises the family by beginning to exhibit independent actions. This first happens while the family is caught in a traffic jam {{on their way to}} the beach for a picnic. The car suddenly instructs Commander Pott to pull a switch which causes Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang to sprout wings and take flight over the stopped cars on the road. Commander Pott flies them to Goodwin Sands in the English Channel where the family picnics, swims, and sleeps. While the family naps, the tide comes in threatening to drown them. Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang wakes them just in time with a hiss of steam. At the car's direction, Commander Pott pulls another switch which causes it to transform into a hovercraft-like vehicle. They make for the French coast and land on a beach near Calais. They explore along the beach and find a cave boobytrapped with some devices intended to scare off intruders. At the back of the cave is a <b>store</b> <b>of</b> armaments and explosives. The family detonates the cache of explosives and flees the cave.|$|E

5|$|Cordyline australis {{is one of}} the few New Zealand {{forest trees}} that can recover from fire. It can renew its trunk from buds on the {{protected}} rhizomes under the ground. This gives the tree an advantage because it can regenerate itself quickly and the fire has eliminated competing plants. Cabbage tree leaves contain oils which make them burn readily. The same oils may also slow down the decay of fallen leaves, so that they build up a dense mat that prevents the seeds of other plants from germinating. When the leaves do break down, they form a fertile soil around the tree. Cabbage tree seed also has a <b>store</b> <b>of</b> oil, which means it remains viable for several years. When a bushfire has cleared the land of vegetation, cabbage tree seeds germinate in great numbers to make the most of the light and space opened up by the flames.|$|E
5|$|Diving beetles, {{such as the}} Dytiscidae, carry {{a bubble}} of air {{with them when they}} dive. Such a bubble may be {{contained}} under the elytra or against the body by specialized hydrophobic hairs. The bubble covers {{at least some of the}} spiracles, permitting air to enter the tracheae. The function of the bubble is not only to contain a <b>store</b> <b>of</b> air, but to act as a physical gill. The air that it traps is in contact with oxygenated water, so as the animal's consumption depletes the oxygen in the bubble, more oxygen can diffuse in to replenish it. Carbon dioxide is more soluble in water than either oxygen or nitrogen, so it readily diffuses out faster than in. Nitrogen is the most plentiful gas in the bubble, and the least soluble, so it constitutes a relatively static component of the bubble and acts as a stable medium for respiratory gases to accumulate in and pass through. Occasional visits to the surface are sufficient for the beetle to re-establish the constitution of the bubble.|$|E
5|$|In 1666, Isaac Newton {{observed}} the Sun's light using a prism, {{and showed that}} it {{is made up of}} light of many colors. In 1800, William Herschel discovered infrared radiation beyond the red part of the solar spectrum. The 19th century saw advancement in spectroscopic studies of the Sun; Joseph von Fraunhofer recorded more than 600 absorption lines in the spectrum, the strongest of which are still often referred to as Fraunhofer lines. In {{the early years of the}} modern scientific era, the source of the Sun's energy was a significant puzzle. Lord Kelvin suggested that the Sun is a gradually cooling liquid body that is radiating an internal <b>store</b> <b>of</b> heat. Kelvin and Hermann von Helmholtz then proposed a gravitational contraction mechanism to explain the energy output, but the resulting age estimate was only 20 million years, well short of the time span of at least 300 million years suggested by some geological discoveries of that time. In 1890 Joseph Lockyer, who discovered helium in the solar spectrum, proposed a meteoritic hypothesis for the formation and evolution of the Sun.|$|E
