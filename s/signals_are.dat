5|$|The {{function}} of aposematism {{is to prevent}} attack, by warning potential predators that the prey animal has defences such as being unpalatable or poisonous. The easily detected warning is a primary defence mechanism, and the non-visible defences are secondary. Aposematic <b>signals</b> <b>are</b> primarily visual, using bright colours and high-contrast patterns such as stripes. Warning <b>signals</b> <b>are</b> honest indications of noxious prey, because conspicuousness evolves in tandem with noxiousness. Thus, the brighter and more conspicuous the organism, the more toxic it usually is.|$|E
5|$|Telecommunications {{in which}} {{multiple}} transmitters and multiple receivers {{have been designed}} to cooperate and to share the same physical channel are called multiplex systems. The sharing of physical channels using multiplexing often gives very large reductions in costs. Multiplexed systems are laid out in telecommunication networks, and the multiplexed <b>signals</b> <b>are</b> switched at nodes through to the correct destination terminal receiver.|$|E
5|$|The Pennsylvania Turnpike used {{traffic lights}} as {{feedback}} signals for E-ZPass users {{since it was}} launched on the roadway in 2001. On March 17, 2017, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission announced that they would begin removing the feedback signals as part of upgrading the toll equipment; the feedback <b>signals</b> <b>are</b> being removed {{because they do not}} conform to federal signage guidelines.|$|E
30|$|The PPG, GSR, SKT sensor <b>signals</b> <b>were</b> {{acquired}} at 500  Hz {{using the}} BioPac’s MP 100 system during the test. The PPG <b>signals</b> <b>were</b> recorded with TSD 203 sensors {{placed on the}} index and ring fingers. The GSR <b>signals</b> <b>were</b> measured using two electrodes which were attached to the index and middle fingers of the subject’s right hand with Ag/AgCl gel materials. The SKT <b>signals</b> <b>were</b> measured with TSD 202 sensors placed on the thumb. Also, two channel electroencephalography (EEG) <b>signals</b> <b>were</b> measured at 512  Hz.|$|R
50|$|When more {{accurate}} time <b>signals</b> <b>were</b> required in navigation, {{a number of}} traditional audible or visible time <b>signals</b> <b>were</b> established so navigators could check their marine chronometers. These public time <b>signals</b> <b>were</b> formerly established in many seaport cities.|$|R

5|$|The listroscelidine katydid Chlorobalius leucoviridis of inland Australia {{is capable}} of {{attracting}} male cicadas of the Tribe Cicadettini by imitating the species-specific reply clicks of sexually receptive female cicadas. This example of acoustic aggressive mimicry {{is similar to the}} Photuris firefly case in that the predator's mimicry is remarkably versatile – playback experiments show that C. leucoviridis is able to attract males of many cicada species, including Cicadettine cicadas from other continents, even though cicada mating <b>signals</b> <b>are</b> species-specific. The evolution of versatile mimicry in C. leucoviridis may have been facilitated by constraints on song evolution in duetting communication systems in which reply <b>signals</b> <b>are</b> recognizable only by their precise timing in relation to the male song (<< 100 ms reply latency).|$|E
5|$|The {{receivers}} {{are based}} on Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit (MMIC) technology, with low noise amplifiers cooled to 15K, which have 20GHz bandwidths and provide 46dB of amplification. The <b>signals</b> <b>are</b> mixed with a local oscillator to reduce their frequency, prior to correlation with an analog correlator. The system temperatures are between 55 and 75K.|$|E
5|$|The sensory {{nervous system}} is {{involved}} with the reception and processing of sensory information. This information is received through the cranial nerves, through tracts in the spinal cord, and directly at centres of the brain exposed to the blood. The brain also receives and interprets information from the special senses (vision, smell, hearing, and taste). Mixed motor and sensory <b>signals</b> <b>are</b> also integrated.|$|E

30|$|The non-attenuated <b>signals</b> <b>were</b> also {{converted}} into attenuation by Eq.  1. In this calculation, 13 non-attenuated <b>signals</b> <b>were</b> randomly {{chosen for the}} intensity of non-attenuation signal and the rest 10 <b>signals</b> <b>were</b> used as the intensity of attenuated signal in Eq.  1. Ideally the attenuation from this calculation must be zero for {{the full range of}} frequency because the non-attenuated <b>signals</b> <b>were</b> used in this calculation.|$|R
40|$|A {{microwave}} radar <b>signal</b> <b>is</b> generated for transmission through an antenna. Before transmission, the <b>signal</b> <b>is</b> phase modulated by 0 deg or 90 deg amounts during each alternate half-cycles of an intermediate frequency (IF) clock signal. After transmission and return, the <b>signal</b> <b>is</b> again phase modulated the same amounts during each alternate half-cycles. The return phase modulated <b>signal</b> <b>is</b> {{mixed with a}} leakage signal component of the microwave signal, leaving an IF Doppler. The IF Doppler <b>signal</b> may then <b>be</b> amplified, removing any requirement that direct current level <b>signals</b> <b>be</b> amplified and also removing the effect of detector noise from the Doppler signal...|$|R
5|$|There are {{multiple}} levels of metabolic regulation. In intrinsic regulation, the metabolic pathway self-regulates {{to respond to}} changes in the levels of substrates or products; for example, a decrease in the amount of product can increase the flux through the pathway to compensate. This type of regulation often involves allosteric regulation of the activities of multiple enzymes in the pathway. Extrinsic control involves a cell in a multicellular organism changing its metabolism in response to signals from other cells. These <b>signals</b> <b>are</b> usually in the form of soluble messengers such as hormones and growth factors and are detected by specific receptors on the cell surface. These <b>signals</b> <b>are</b> then transmitted inside the cell by second messenger systems that often involved the phosphorylation of proteins.|$|E
5|$|Aposematism (from Greek ἀπό apo away, σῆμα sema sign) was a {{new term}} coined by Edward Bagnall Poulton for Alfred Russel Wallace's concept of warning coloration. It {{describes}} a family of antipredator adaptations in which a warning signal {{is associated with the}} unprofitability of a prey item to potential predators. Aposematism always involves an advertising signal. The warning signal may take the form of conspicuous animal coloration, sounds, odours or other perceivable characteristics. Aposematic <b>signals</b> <b>are</b> beneficial for both the predator and prey, since both avoid potential harm.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1960s, James E. Lloyd's {{investigation}} of female fireflies {{of the genus}} Photuris revealed they emit the same light signals that females of the genus Photinus use as a mating signal. Further research showed male fireflies from several different genera are attracted to these mimics, and are subsequently captured and eaten. Female <b>signals</b> <b>are</b> based on that received from the male, each female having a repertoire of signals matching the delay and duration of the female of the corresponding species. This mimicry may have evolved from non-mating signals that have become modified for predation.|$|E

5|$|Communication using surface-borne {{vibrational}} signals is {{more widespread}} among insects because of size constraints in producing air-borne sounds. Insects cannot effectively produce low-frequency sounds, and high-frequency sounds tend to disperse {{more in a}} dense environment (such as foliage), so insects living in such environments communicate primarily using substrate-borne vibrations. The mechanisms of production of vibrational <b>signals</b> <b>are</b> just as diverse as those for producing sound in insects.|$|E
5|$|Each sensory system {{begins with}} {{specialized}} receptor cells, such as light-receptive neurons in the retina of the eye, or vibration-sensitive neurons in the cochlea of the ear. The axons of sensory receptor cells travel into {{the spinal cord}} or brain, where they transmit their signals to a first-order sensory nucleus dedicated to one specific sensory modality. This primary sensory nucleus sends information to higher-order sensory areas that are dedicated to the same modality. Eventually, via a way-station in the thalamus, the <b>signals</b> <b>are</b> sent to the cerebral cortex, where they are processed to extract the relevant features, and integrated with signals coming from other sensory systems.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, the EyeTV HD {{product for}} {{recording}} high-definition {{cable and satellite}} programming was introduced. Because cable and satellite <b>signals</b> <b>are</b> encoded, the device must be connected to a tuner from a television provider. Then it provides remote controls, recording and DVR-functionality from a connected computer. A Macworld review gave the product {{four out of five}} stars. A review in Laptop Magazine gave EyeTV HD 3.5 out of 5 stars. It said the interface was intuitive and the video quality was good, but noted it was only compatible with Macs.|$|E
50|$|In {{conventional}} PCM, {{the analog}} <b>signal</b> may <b>be</b> processed (e.g., by amplitude compression) before being digitized. Once the <b>signal</b> <b>is</b> digitized, the PCM <b>signal</b> <b>is</b> usually subjected to further processing (e.g., digital data compression).|$|R
30|$|In {{a direct}} {{sequence}} spread spectrum system, a data <b>signal</b> <b>is</b> multiplied by a pseudorandom binary sequence. The bandwidth of the modulated <b>signal</b> <b>is</b> {{larger than that}} of the original data signal. One advantage of this spreading spectrum is that the resulting <b>signal</b> <b>is</b> more resistant to narrow-band interference.|$|R

5|$|Older {{models that}} used tube power {{amplifiers}} {{used a variety}} of 6-pin connectors, while later models used a 9-pin connector. In all cases, for a single organ – Leslie configuration, the mains power, audio and control <b>signals</b> <b>are</b> all carried on the connector, and the design of the pin layouts varies between organs and speakers. Care must be taken when attempting to service them since an incorrectly or poorly wired cable can cause permanent damage to the organ and / or speaker, or result in electrocution. It is also possible to connect multiple Leslie speakers to a single organ, by using a power relay that provides the necessary AC current.|$|E
5|$|On 24 January 2009, Ofcom allowed {{electrical}} {{retailers to}} be granted a licence to rebroadcast DAB signals within their stores to demonstrate DAB radio sets within their stores. The United Kingdom consumer charity, Which? warned that consumers who could not get an adequate DAB signal could be misled by the in-store sets. The Digital Radio Development Bureau replied to the Which? report stating that stores contain a steel structure which produce a faraday cage effect where DAB <b>signals</b> <b>are</b> blocked out. The DRDB recommended that consumers should check DAB coverage online with their postcode before purchasing a DAB radio to avoid disappointment.|$|E
5|$|One {{class of}} honest signal is the aposematic warning signal, {{generally}} visual, given by poisonous or dangerous {{animals such as}} wasps, poison dart frogs, and pufferfish. Warning <b>signals</b> <b>are</b> honest indications of noxious prey, because conspicuousness evolves in tandem with noxiousness. Thus, the brighter and more conspicuous the organism, the more toxic it usually is. The most common and effective colours are red, yellow, black and white.|$|E

5|$|Pursuit-deterrent <b>signals</b> <b>are</b> {{behavioral}} signals used by prey that convince predators not {{to pursue}} them.

As a result, predators may choose to pursue a different prey that is less likely to outrun them.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{found out}} that very weak {{electromagnetic}} fields disrupt the magnetic compass used by European robins and other songbirds to navigate using the Earth's magnetic field. Neither power lines nor cellphone <b>signals</b> <b>are</b> {{to blame for the}} electromagnetic field effect on the birds, according to the new study published in the 8 May 2014 edition of the journal Nature.

5|$|<b>Signals</b> <b>are</b> {{given in}} {{contexts}} such as mate selection by females, which subjects the advertising males' signals to selective pressure. Signals thus evolve because they modify the behaviour of {{the receiver to}} benefit the signaller. Signals may be honest, conveying information which usefully increases the fitness of the receiver, or dishonest. An individual can cheat by giving a dishonest signal, which might briefly benefit that signaller, {{at the risk of}} undermining the signalling system for the whole population.|$|E
