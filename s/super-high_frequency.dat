40|$|It is {{investigated}} if {{predictions of}} the inflationary scenario regarding spectra of scalar and tensor perturbations generated from quantum vacuum fluctuations are robust {{with respect to a}} modification of the dispersion law for frequencies beyond the Planck scale. For a large class of such modifications of special and general relativity, for which the WKB condition is not violated at <b>super-high</b> <b>frequencies,</b> the predictions remain unchanged. The opposite possibility is excluded by the absence of large amount of created particles due to the present Universe expansion. Creation of particles in the quantum state minimizing the energy density of a given mode at the moment of Planck boundary crossing is prohibited by the latter argument, too (contrary to creation in the adiabatic vacuum state which is very small now) ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>super-high</b> <b>frequency</b> (SHF) and {{extremely}} high frequency (EHF) of microwaves are on the short side of radio waves. Microwaves are waves that are typically short enough (measured in millimeters) to employ tubular metal waveguides of reasonable diameter. Microwave energy is produced with klystron and magnetron tubes, and with solid state diodes such as Gunn and IMPATT devices. Microwaves are absorbed by molecules that have a dipole moment in liquids. In a microwave oven, this effect is used to heat food. Low-intensity microwave radiation is used in Wi-Fi, although this is at intensity levels unable to cause thermal heating.|$|E
50|$|Ultra high {{frequency}} (UHF) is the ITU designation for radio frequencies {{in the range}} between 300 megahertz (MHz) and 3 gigahertz (GHz), {{also known as the}} decimetre band as the wavelengths range from one meter to one decimeter. Radio waves with frequencies above the UHF band fall into the SHF (<b>super-high</b> <b>frequency)</b> or microwave frequency range. Lower frequency signals fall into the VHF (very {{high frequency}}) or lower bands. UHF radio waves propagate mainly by line of sight; they are blocked by hills and large buildings although the transmission through building walls is strong enough for indoor reception. They are used for television broadcasting, cell phones, satellite communication including GPS, personal radio services including Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, walkie-talkies, cordless phones, and numerous other applications.|$|E

To reduce the load on the combined sewer system, there are engineering solutions collect rain and melt water {{for use in the}} irrigation of lawns and green spaces. Research carried out at the department “Water supply and sanitation”, (Russia), confirm the high pollution concentrations of meltwater and rainfall in urban arias. Series of measurements of heavy metal in rainwater runoff carried out in Hungary demonstrates clearly the differences in concentrations in the function of distance {{from the edge of the}} road. Also differences are introduced between pollution concentrations in runoff water from within and outside urban traffic roads. The quality of snow cover, forming meltwater is observed to be changing in dependence on roadway location.

40|$|Two {{uncertain}} {{factors affecting}} a telecommunication system’s performance are {{effective antenna gain}} and system noise temperature. For an Earth-geostationary satellite–Moon system, they are attributed to the atmospheric attenuation and ra-diation. In the <b>super-high</b> <b>frequency</b> band, the attenuations are mostly weather re-lated and have the same values for both upward- and downward-propagating signals, while brightness temperatures have different effects for upward- and downward-looking antennas. In this study, six link scenarios for this system are analyzed. Analysis of atmospheric attenuation and brightness temperatures for each link are presented. This study also discusses the general methodology for determining the noise temperature for a receiving antenna pointing to a blackbody of a given angular extent. A set of curves is presented that is independent of the sizes and brightness temperatures of black bodies. Antenna noise temperature increases are calculated {{as a function of}} distance between the antenna beam center and the blackbody disk center normalized by the disk radius. To show an example, these ratios are applied to a case of an Earth-based antenna looking toward the Moon. I...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} {{decreasing}} {{the strength of}} frost rocks (FRs) under <b>super-high</b> <b>frequency</b> (SHF) heating has been investigated. A physical model of behaviour of the FRs subjected to SHF and mechanical action has been built. The laws determining the reduction in strength and increase in capability for compacting under SHF adiabatic heating have been established. The effect of the SHF field power on the FR mass has been studied. A method optimizing the process of introduction of the SHF power into the rock mass has been developed. The concept of SHF aerodynamic (AD) means of crushing productive disintegrated bulk frost rock formations has been substantiated. The processes of working a gold-containing stratum by using the SHF-AD method, {{as well as that}} of cleaning the productive FRs layer on the working out floor by means of the cutting-break-off destruction in combination with picking up the rock mass have been investigated. A new technology of mining gold directly in the mine has been conceptually substantiated. The results obtained can be used in gold-mining industry, as well as in construction work on fermafrost.

40|$|Review Focus: General {{considerations}} on ablation procedure advocated {{in clinical}} contexts using electromagnetic (EM) energy are comprehensively reviewed. Relevant radiofrequency (RF) and/or microwave ablation techniques {{that have been}} in vogue and in traditional use across clinical procedures are revisited. Traditionally, RF/microwave ablations have been applied to a variety of pathological states, (in lieu of surgical methods and/or electrocautry procedures) so as to remove unwanted/cancerous tissue layers. Relevantly, new avenues of adopting unexplored electromagnetic (EM) energy falling in the spectral range of mm-wave/THz frequencies for such medical ablation purposes are studied. These higher frequencies for ablation can be considered either to supplant or used in parallel with the existing RF/microwave bands (at 915 MHz and 2. 45 GHz). The motivation thereof is to identify certain improved ablation feasibility and derivable merits in clinical sense. Hence, the efficacy of the proposed scheme is identified for two exemplar ablation therapy procedures pertinent to Barrett’s esophagus and menorrhagia. Pertinent pros and cons are discussed and practical ablator designs are indicated. Study Details: Considering the strategy of using the proposed mm-wave/THz EM energy would amount to a shallow ablation via ‘thermal scouring’ of the tissue-linings intended for ablation and prevent otherwise undesirable hot-spots in deep-tissue media. This is conceivable because the advocated frequency bands would allow a very shallow skin-depth of penetration of EM energy; and hence, tissue-heating will be limited only to superficial linings. Further, the associated <b>super-high</b> <b>frequency</b> will heat the ablation site extremely fast reducing the procedure time considerably. In a Nut-shell: The study first offers a comprehensive review on classical and projects de novo aspects of EM ablation therapy with unexplored electromagnetic spectral resources of mm-Wave/THz band. Illustrated as examples are feasibility details concerning the ablation of the endometrium and Barrett’s esophagus. Design aspects of ablators are presented. Place and Duration of Study: The study reported is limited to a review on the subjectmatter and provides analytical designs and computational models on the procedure performed (2012 - 2013) at: Department of Computer and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, College of Engineering & Computer Science, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, Florida 33431, USA...|$|E
