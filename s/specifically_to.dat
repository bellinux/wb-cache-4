5|$|After the 1896 launch {{was called}} off, enthusiasm {{declined}} for joining the expedition {{for a second}} attempt in 1897. From the candidates Andrée picked the 27-year-old engineer, Knut Frænkel, to replace Ekholm. Frænkel was a civil engineer from the north of Sweden, an athlete who was fond of long mountain hikes. He was enrolled <b>specifically</b> <b>to</b> take over Ekholm's meteorological observations. Despite lacking Ekholm's theoretical and scientific knowledge, he handled this task efficiently. His meteorological journal has enabled researchers to reconstruct {{the movements of the}} three men during their last few months with considerable precision.|$|E
5|$|All the {{functions}} of DNA depend on interactions with proteins. These protein interactions can be non-specific, or the protein can bind <b>specifically</b> <b>to</b> a single DNA sequence. Enzymes can also bind to DNA and of these, the polymerases that copy the DNA base sequence in transcription and DNA replication are particularly important.|$|E

5|$|Ballas and {{carbonado}} diamond are exceptional, as {{they are}} polycrystalline and therefore much tougher than single-crystal diamond; they are used for deep-drilling bits and other demanding industrial applications. Particular faceting shapes of diamonds {{are more prone to}} breakage and thus may be uninsurable by reputable insurance companies. The brilliant cut of gemstones is designed <b>specifically</b> <b>to</b> reduce the likelihood of breakage or splintering.|$|E
5|$|Base J (beta-d-glucopyranosyloxymethyluracil), a {{modified}} form of uracil, {{is also found}} in several organisms: the flagellates Diplonema and Euglena, and all the kinetoplastid genera. Biosynthesis of J occurs in two steps: in the first step, a specific thymidine in DNA is converted into hydroxymethyldeoxyuridine; in the second, HOMedU is glycosylated to form J. Proteins that bind <b>specifically</b> <b>to</b> this base have been identified. These proteins appear to be distant relatives of the Tet1 oncogene that is involved in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia. J appears to act as a termination signal for RNA polymerase II.|$|E
5|$|Bodyline, {{also known}} as fast leg theory bowling, was a cricketing tactic devised by the English cricket team for their 1932–33 Ashes tour of Australia, <b>specifically</b> <b>to</b> combat the {{extraordinary}} batting skill of Australia's Don Bradman. England's use of a tactic perceived by some as overly aggressive or even unfair ultimately threatened diplomatic {{relations between the two}} countries before the situation was calmed.|$|E

5|$|Following the arming of the Italian ironclads Duilio and Dandolo with 100-ton guns, the British feared an Italian {{attack on}} Malta, as the ships could fire on Malta's batteries, {{destroying}} them {{one after the}} other, while keeping outside their guns' range. To prevent this, the British requested that four 100-ton guns be built. Two of these were installed in Malta, and Cambridge Battery and Rinella Battery were built <b>specifically</b> <b>to</b> house these guns. Construction of the batteries began in 1878 and they were complete by 1886. The gun at Rinella still exists.|$|E
5|$|From {{at least}} the 16th century, daffadown dilly and daffydowndilly have {{appeared}} as playful synonyms of the name. In common parlance and in historical documents, the term daffodil may refer <b>specifically</b> <b>to</b> populations or specimens of the wild daffodil, N. pseudonarcissus. H. N. Ellacombe suggests this may be from Saffon Lilly, citing Prior in support, though admittedly conjectural.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, Rutherford {{published}} a systematic reinterpretation {{of the book}} of Revelation. Many of the symbols recorded in the book were applied to events following 1918, <b>specifically</b> <b>to</b> Watch Tower conventions held in the years 1922 through 1928. These reinterpretations reflected both a wholesale rejection of his own earlier views as well as the historicist interpretations of Pastor Russell.|$|E

Many jeeps were filled with six or seven men claiming they were retreating after their position was overrun. He averaged about 75 stragglers a day, and 150 on the last day of the battle.
