5|$|In 1994 {{the service}} area {{was subject to}} a {{management}} buyout, led by Nick Turner, who had been running {{the site for the}} previous three years. It was announced the <b>services</b> <b>would</b> trade under the new name, Take a Break. At the time RoadChef unsuccessfully showed interest in purchasing the site, it wasn't until 2001, by purchasing Take A Break that RoadChef started operating at the Strensham site.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-2000s, German sect experts {{expressed}} concerns that Scientologists were becoming {{active in the}} German after-school tutoring market. These concerns arose because customers of around 20 after-school tutoring centres operated by Scientologists in Frankfurt, Hamburg, Stuttgart and elsewhere might be unaware that their children were being taught by Scientologists, using Scientology methods. Brochures advertising the tutoring <b>services</b> <b>would</b> at most mention the name of L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, but not Scientology itself.|$|E
5|$|Powers were renewed in 1926 {{for four}} tracks from Hammersmith to west of Acton Town, {{with the concept}} of the Piccadilly running {{non-stop}} on the inner pair. The proposed service split, with the Piccadilly running through to Harrow and Hounslow, was clarified by 1929. District <b>services</b> <b>would</b> run mainly through to Wimbledon, Richmond, Hounslow and Ealing, with shuttles from South Harrow to Uxbridge and Acton Town to South Acton.|$|E
50|$|The {{frequency}} of <b>service</b> <b>would</b> be improved. Midday and Saturday <b>service</b> <b>would</b> operate every 10 minutes instead 15, and Sunday service every 15 minutes instead of 20.|$|R

50|$|After {{the airline}} {{deregulation}} of the late 1970s, the nature of commercial <b>service</b> <b>would</b> change for Hickory. Now smaller, commuter airline <b>service</b> <b>would</b> be offered to feed large hubs of aviation activity.|$|R
5|$|After the 1960s, lack of {{investment}} led to local {{services and the}} station becoming increasingly run down. By the early 1980s, Marylebone was under serious threat of closure. In 1983, British Rail chairman Peter Parker commissioned a report into the possibility of converting Marylebone into a 'high-speed bus way', whereby Marylebone would be converted into a coach station. The tracks between Marylebone, Harrow-on-the-Hill and South Ruislip would have closed, and {{been converted into a}} road for the exclusive use of buses and coaches. British Rail services via High Wycombe would have been diverted into Paddington, and the Aylesbury <b>services</b> <b>would</b> have been taken over by London Underground on an extended Metropolitan line, and then routed to Baker Street.|$|E
5|$|Air Marshal Murdoch led the RAAF {{through the}} {{build-up}} of Australia's {{commitment to the}} Vietnam War beginning in the mid-1960s. He clashed with the Chief of the General Staff (CGS), Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton, over the latter's recommendation in mid-1965 to deploy two UH-1 Iroquois helicopters to Vietnam. Wilton believed that both <b>services</b> <b>would</b> benefit from gaining familiarisation with air/ground operations in the region before large-scale commitment of Australian forces. Murdoch dismissed the idea on resourcing grounds, {{despite the fact that}} two-thirds of the RAAF's UH-1 complement had been purchased {{for the express purpose of}} army cooperation.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the tenders were submitted, it turned out only NSB, DSB and Veolia had chosen bid. The tender was won by NSB Anbud on 30 May 2005, wanting NOK 70 million {{annually}} for the contract, ten million less than with the former agreement. After the contract was won, NSB Anbud announced the schedule for the Gjøvik Line. The number of train <b>services</b> <b>would</b> increase by 40%. Three stations serving the recreational area Nordmarka outside Oslo would be dropped—Elnes, Stryken and Bjørgeseter. Skogsholm tried to make an agreement with NSB to not abandon all the stations, but since this had not {{been part of the}} PSO tender, an agreement could not be made and the service was canceled.|$|E

5|$|Michaels and Diesel's feud resumed at the Royal Rumble when Michaels {{attacked}} Diesel {{during his}} match with Hart. Michaels then became the top {{contender for the}} WWF World Heavyweight Championship by winning the 1995 Royal Rumble match. Diesel won their match at WrestleMania after Sid, Michaels' new bodyguard, accidentally distracted the referee. Diesel offered Michaels a rematch, and Michaels told Sid that his <b>services</b> <b>would</b> not be required during the rematch. Sid attacked Michaels, and Diesel came to Michaels' defense. This attack caused Michaels to turn face, and he and Diesel resumed their friendship and won the WWF Tag Team Championship later in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after this}} incident, {{the family moved}} from the Ardennes to Brussels after a message from their father that the {{financial}} problems had ended. When they reached Brussels {{they found that the}} situation was actually worse than previously, and the family moved between cheap hotels, each one worse than the one before. Desperate for a job, Hastings accepted the offer of an apprenticeship with an English engineer who claimed to have made a machine to extract gold in North Wales. After {{about a year and a}} half of work they discovered that there was no gold to be found in that part of Wales, and Hastings was informed that his <b>services</b> <b>would</b> no longer be needed.|$|E
5|$|The services, {{the first}} of its kind in the UK, opened at the same time as the new {{motorway}} on 2 November 1959. They evolved from discussions during 1955 and 1956 by the Ministry of Transport over what facilities should be present on new motorways. Civil engineer Owen Williams visited the United States to see what existing rest areas were available, and based his designs on these. Watford Gap was chosen as one of four pilot sites, though by 1958 the Ministry had decided only this and Newport Pagnell <b>services</b> <b>would</b> open with the motorway.|$|E

5|$|Throughout July the {{battalion}} undertook garrison duties in Trieste before the 2nd New Zealand Division was withdrawn to Lake Trasimene. On 15 August 1945 news was received of Japan's unconditional surrender, ending plans for {{the battalion}} {{to take part in}} further combat in the Pacific. In September it was decided that as part of the departure of New Zealand troops from the theatre, memorial <b>services</b> <b>would</b> be held at the locations of the division's major battles. As a part of this program services were held at Cassino and Sangro and on Crete, while smaller parties were sent to Coriano Ridge, Faenza, Forli, Padua, Monfalcone and Udine.|$|E
5|$|According to game creator Steven Howse, he was {{inspired}} to create the game while he was experiencing financial problems. As {{a result of these}} financial issues, he had to move from Minneapolis to Michigan, where he realized the popularity of Agar.io. He had long wanted to create an online multiplayer game, but the only option for the development at the time was in Adobe Flash, and not wanting to use this method, he gave up the idea for a while. Howse finally created the game when he realized that WebSocket, a low-latency protocol supported by most major browsers, was sufficient and stable enough to run an HTML game similar to other games such as Agar.io. The most difficult part of the development was in making each server stable enough to handle 600 players at a time. Howse struggled to find space on servers with enough space in regions where there was more demand and tried to avoid cloud services like Amazon Web Services, owing to the high cost that these <b>services</b> <b>would</b> incur based on the amount of bandwidth used.|$|E
5|$|Neligan was {{enlisted in}} the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 20 August 1914 at Townsville, Queensland, under the name Maurice Wilder, again giving Auckland as his place of birth. The AIF was {{established}} as Australia's expeditionary force {{to fight in the}} war, as the Citizens' Forces were restricted to home defence per the Defence Act (1903). He had first attempted to enlist under his true name and age, and had told the clerk he was married with a child. When told that younger unmarried men were volunteering in great numbers, and that his <b>services</b> <b>would</b> not be required, he merely joined a queue in front of a different clerk, gave the name Wilder and claimed he was a bachelor. With the rank of private he was allotted to the Queensland-raised 9th Battalion of the 3rd Brigade, which was part of the 1st Division, and was given the regimental number 974. Within three weeks he had been promoted to lance corporal, and by late September was a corporal. The battalion embarked for overseas the following month and sailed via Albany, Western Australia, to Egypt on the Themistocles, arriving in early December. On 1 January 1915, Wilder was promoted to sergeant, and he was posted as the battalion orderly room sergeant.|$|E

5|$|On March 21, 2016, the Attorney General {{announced}} a partial settlement of its lawsuit, under which DraftKings and FanDuel agreed to cease offering paid {{games in the}} state of New York, and abide by the result of an upcoming appeals court hearing. The hearings, which would determine whether the <b>services</b> <b>would</b> have to pay restitution, were tentatively scheduled for September 2016—assuming that legislation legalizing daily fantasy sports was not passed by then. DraftKings and FanDuel spokespersons stated that the companies were working with local officials and supporting legislation to legalize DFS under state law. This settlement does not address the false advertising claims, which are still being pursued. The next day, Yahoo announced that it would voluntarily comply with the settlement and also cease offering paid games {{in the state of}} New York.|$|E
5|$|On {{arrival at}} the {{terminus}} the mourners would be led either {{to one of the}} dedicated first class waiting rooms (for first and second class funerals) or to the communal third class waiting room. The coffin would be discreetly unloaded from the hearse and sent to the platform level by lift. Those attending first and second class funerals would be permitted to watch the coffins being loaded onto the train if they so wished. (After the relocation to the new London terminus in 1902, some funeral <b>services</b> <b>would</b> be held in a Chapelle Ardente on platform level, for those cases where mourners were unable to make the journey to Brookwood.) Each door of the waiting train would be labelled with the name of the deceased, to ensure all passengers travelled with the correct funeral party; the names of the deceased being carried on the train would be called in turn, and that person's mourners would board the train.|$|E
