50|$|In 1990, {{there were}} 400 {{different}} items {{added to the}} list of items manufactured. In 2015, Skilcraft introduced a new line of products which included screwdrivers and <b>socket</b> <b>wrenches.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A ratchet is a {{mechanical}} device that allows continuous linear or rotary motion {{in only one}} direction while preventing motion in the opposite direction. Ratchets are widely used in machinery and tools. Though something of a misnomer, [...] "ratchet" [...] is also often {{used to refer to}} ratcheting <b>socket</b> <b>wrenches,</b> a common tool with a ratcheting handle.|$|E
50|$|A {{breaker bar}} {{is a long}} non-ratcheting bar that is used with <b>socket</b> <b>wrench</b> style <b>sockets.</b> Breaker bars are used to break loose very tight {{fasteners}} because their additional length allows {{the same amount of}} force to generate significantly more torque than a standard length <b>socket</b> <b>wrench.</b> The use of a breaker bar also prevents damage to the ratcheting mechanism of a <b>socket</b> <b>wrench.</b> Often, after the first 1/2 turn of a fastener, the fastener is then loose enough to be turned with a <b>socket</b> <b>wrench.</b>|$|R

50|$|Tools, such as hooks or <b>socket</b> <b>wrenches</b> can {{be mounted}} {{at the end}} of the pole. More {{sophisticated}} poles can accept pneumatically or hydraulically driven power tools which allow, for example, bolts to be unscrewed remotely. A rotary wire brush allows a terminal to be scoured clean before a connection is made. However, a worker's dexterity is naturally reduced when operating tools {{at the end of}} a pole that is several metres long.|$|E
5000|$|A socket wrench, {{with the}} correct type of socket, {{can be used to}} loosen or tighten a large variety of {{fasteners}} with lower cost, greater ease and often more torque than can be applied with a screwdriver handle. A common use of these different [...] "screw" [...] head type sockets is to attach to power versions of the <b>socket</b> <b>wrenches</b> (impact sockets) which allow the fasteners to be loosened or tightened much faster and more powerfully than can be done by hand.|$|E
50|$|Unlike most <b>socket</b> <b>{{wrenches}},</b> tuning wrenches {{usually have}} a comfortable wood or nylon handle. They are found in two basic shapes: L-shaped and T-shaped. L-shaped handles for pianos are available in several angles that are not quite right angles, provide greater leverage than T-shaped handles, and the angle provides clearance for the handle over adjacent pins, allowing a very short (and stiff) socket to be used. A short, stiff socket enables a better feel {{and control of the}} tiny movements of the tuning pin, within the pin-block. T-shaped handles are used for many lower-tension instruments such as the harpsichord, harp, and dulcimer. T-shaped handles help keep torque parallel to the shaft of the tuning pin, and thus avoid bending the pin and widening the wooden hole that holds the tuning pin.|$|E
50|$|A <b>socket</b> <b>wrench</b> {{is a type}} of wrench or spanner {{that has}} a socket {{attached}} at one end, usually used to turn a fastener.|$|R
5000|$|A socket is {{typically}} a cylinder {{which has a}} female six- or twelve-point recessed opening sized to fit over the common male hexagonal head of a bolt or nut fastener. The {{opposite end of the}} <b>socket</b> <b>wrench</b> has a standardized (ANSI B107, ISO, or other consensus standard) square recess to accept the <b>socket</b> <b>wrench's</b> drive size. Male drivers are also produced for use with socket head cap screws, and are often called Allen drivers (trademark) or the generic term male bit drivers ...|$|R
50|$|IMPERIAL-Newton Corporation is an American {{company that}} {{manufactures}} custom and specialized impact <b>sockets,</b> <b>socket</b> <b>wrench</b> {{and other large}} bolt equipment utilized for large heavy industrial applications.|$|R
50|$|Socket wrench showcases in unique sizes. There's a great {{demand for}} impact <b>socket</b> <b>wrenches</b> across the world. The {{ordinary}} man needs them to repair, assemble or maintain equipment. The US Department of Defense and the US Department of Energy need them, {{as well as}} the Army Corps of Engineers. The global Aerospace community and large industries such as electric power generation, chemical production and mining also need them. Rail car operators need them, as do owners of large equipment with special shapes or unusual sizes and depths. This is exactly where IMPERIAL-Newton Corporation comes in. The company manufactures a uniquely and purposefully large and diverse range of shapes, alloys, sizes and depths of impact sockets which are unique in the marketplace of tools; and intended strictly for industrial usage.|$|E
50|$|SK {{was founded}} as the Sherman-Klove Company, specializing in screw-machine products, by Mason H. Sherman and Noah Grover Klove. The company {{was founded in}} the early 20th century to supply munitions in World War I, and made mortar {{housings}} in a screw machine plant on Harrison Street in Chicago. During the 1920s SK operated primarily as a contract company, making tools for other brands (including Craftsman). Business thrived, they made specialty screw machine products that did well until the depression. William S. Sherman (W.S.), Mason's son, came to SK after graduating college in 1927 and was eventually a major owner of the company. One of the products the company made was <b>socket</b> <b>wrenches</b> for Hinsdale Socket and Wrench Company. The Hinsdale Company {{went out of business}} during the great depression leaving Sherman-Klove with a large inventory of this product, they then redesigned the product and changed the company name to S-K Tools.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are also}} power tool {{versions}} of [...] "air" [...] (pneumatic) ratchets which use compressed air power to drive air powered <b>socket</b> <b>wrenches</b> which tighten or loosen nuts or bolts. A second major variety of compressed air powered tools are impact wrenches {{which are used}} for common tasks such as lug nuts on wheels. Electric powered impact wrenches for the same tasks are not uncommon. Small cordless 12 volt and 18 volt impact drivers are often used today as powered ratchets to remove and install nuts and bolts. Hydraulic motor ratchets with their characteristic higher torque are rare outside heavy industry. The sockets used for impact duty (called [...] "impact sockets") are made with thicker walls and tempered to a lower hardness {{so as not to}} shatter under the impacts of the impact tool. They are typically finished in black oxide rather than the usual chrome plating of the hand-tool variety. Standard sockets (i.e. non-impact sockets) may shatter if used with impact wrenches, presenting a safety risk.|$|E

50|$|Spin disks {{are usually}} a flat round disk, {{commonly}} of plastic, with a square {{hole in the}} middle to fit over the <b>socket</b> <b>wrench's</b> male adapter plug. The edges are grooved for a solid grip.|$|R
50|$|A lug wrench is {{the name}} for a type of <b>socket</b> <b>wrench</b> used to loosen and tighten lug nuts on {{automobile}} wheels. In the United Kingdom and Australia it {{is commonly known as}} a wheel brace.|$|R
50|$|The most {{prevalent}} form is the ratcheting socket wrench, often improperly called a ratchet. A ratcheting socket wrench is the device within a hand tool {{in which a}} metal handle {{is attached to a}} ratcheting mechanism, which attaches to a socket, which in turn fits onto a type of bolt or nut. Pulled or pushed in one direction, the ratchet loosens or tightens the bolt or nut attached to the socket. Turned the other direction, the ratchet does not turn the socket but allows the ratchet handle to be re-positioned for another turn while staying attached to the bolt or nut. This ratcheting action allows the fastener to be rapidly tightened or loosened in small increments without disconnecting the tool from the fastener. A switch is built into the ratchet head that allows the user to apply the ratcheting action in either direction, as needed, to tighten or loosen a fastener. Other common methods of driving <b>socket</b> <b>wrenches</b> include pneumatic impact wrenches, hydraulic torque wrenches, torque multipliers and breaker bars. Some lesser known hybrid drivers include striking wrench tools with square drive, and hydraulic impact wrenches (typically powered by on site hydraulic power such as present with military tanks, and many rail car applications).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Socket</b> <b>wrenches</b> {{are most}} {{commonly}} hexagonal, or more {{commonly referred to}} as [...] "6-point" [...] in lay terms. Sockets are driven by being attached to the driving tool via a male/female square connection fitting (called the square drive). Standard sizes of square drives around the world include 1/4", 3/8", 1/2", 3/4", 1", 1-1/2", 2-1/2" [...] and 3-1/2" [...] square drive sizes (a de facto international standard with no metric equivalents) along with some lesser used drivers such as 5/8" [...] square drive, and both #4 and #5 spline drives specified in ANSI B107 specifications. This wide range of square drive sizes provides {{for a wide variety of}} socket types and sizes to suit small to very large nuts and bolts. Some square drivers have a through hole to attach the socket to the driver (using a retaining ring with o-ring and pin type, or single piece molded retaining rings), a locking pin, or friction ball. Some common hand ratchets employ a quick release button on their top for quick socket release of smaller sockets.The tool chosen to drive the socket wrench ultimately supplies the mechanical advantage needed by the user to provide the torque needed to loosen or tighten the fastener as may be required. Larger drivers are typically used with higher torque, while smaller drivers are used for convenience in smaller low torque applications. Given the limits of human strength and fatigue, torque above 600 ft-lbs of torque will generally involve some kind of power assist, instead of the user simply pushing on the handle of a wrench. Very large sockets and drivers are typically powered by hydraulics to achieve torque.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{applications}} use {{air driven}} or {{electric impact wrench}} or impact driver to deliver the amount of shock and torque required to tighten or loosen the different bolts or nuts in use. Inside an impact wrench there is a rotating hammer, usually driven by electricity or air pressure, {{that is used to}} incrementally rotate the output shaft. The impact wrench is designed to deliver high torque output with minimal exertion by the user, by storing energy in a rotating mass, then delivering it suddenly to the output shaft via a hammering action. While typical impact wrenches deliver between 500 and 1500 ft-lbs of torque, some larger impact wrenches such as the Ingersoll Rand 599A1 can deliver near 80,000 ft-lb (10850 Nm) of torque which is enough to tighten hex nuts 7" [...] across flats. Even if the socket attached to the impact wrench does not turn, it is still subjected to successive shock blows by the impact wrench's internal hammer(s). These successive blows are often enough to loosen or tighten a tight or corroded nut or bolt or in some cases break or strip the fastener. Impact wrenches are hard on the sockets since the sockets in use also get hammered. Regular chrome plated [...] "hand sockets" [...] like those commonly included with hand ratchet wrench tool sets are not suitable for this kind of high load impact application. Hand sockets, when used with an impact wrench, can break or shatter explosively if they are used with an impact wrench. Impact sockets are specifically designed and manufactured for impact gun use, and are nearly always made from a thicker, tougher and more ductile alloy steel that is then heat treated for extra durability. Most impact sockets made for [...] "standard" [...] hexagonal fasteners have a six-point design. For more flexibility many impact sockets are made with swivel type socket—socket wrench attachment geometry. These impact sockets are rarely, if ever, chrome-plated, as chrome will chip off under impact use, and the process of chrome plating hardened steel causes some hydrogen embrittlement which can cause parts to crack. Instead, impact sockets are most commonly finished with a black oxide surface or other conversion treatment to provide some corrosion and rust protection and improved appearance even after hard impact wrench use. Although ordinary hand sockets should never be used with impact wrenches, impact sockets can be used with hand <b>socket</b> <b>wrenches</b> and other hand drivers.|$|E

5000|$|Williams {{returned}} with a tire iron and a <b>socket</b> <b>wrench,</b> the latter of which he gave to Draper. Draper, seemingly having second thoughts, urged Williams to leave. Williams replied, [...] "I know what I'm doin, I know what I'm doin. Don't worry about it, I know what I'm doin." [...] He then began battering Norwood's head with the tire iron. When he noticed that Draper was frozen in place, Williams said, [...] "Man, you with me? We {{got to do this}} together." [...] Draper then sprung into action himself, striking Norwood repeatedly with the <b>socket</b> <b>wrench.</b> This violent scene continued until Norwood lay motionless and dead." ...|$|R
5000|$|Specialized [...] "wobble" [...] or swivel sockets {{are made}} {{that have a}} {{separate}} socket head and <b>socket</b> <b>wrench</b> connection that allows the socket to wobble or swivel over a limited range independent of the <b>socket</b> <b>wrench</b> or tool position when it {{is attached to the}} bolt or nut. This may be a distinct advantage in some applications with restricted access. These [...] "wobble/swivel" [...] sockets, with their typical ball and socket joint swivel attachments, are made {{in a wide variety of}} types and sizes including deep, shallow, impact, triple square. They are often found in impact sets since they can be built sturdier than a common universal joint socket.|$|R
40|$|Simple tool stakes hard-steel parts [...] that is, forces {{one part}} into recess on another, {{deforming}} receiving part {{so that it}} restrains inserted one. Tool allows small machine shops to stake hard steel without massive presses. Can be used, for example, to insert ball and spring into hard steel snap-tool body such as that used to turn <b>socket</b> <b>wrenches.</b> Use {{is not limited to}} hard steel; can be used as well to assemble parts made of softer materials...|$|E
50|$|Using {{the spin}} disk {{will be much}} quicker than using the <b>socket</b> <b>wrench's</b> handle, {{especially}} if its range of motion is limited. If the nut is very loose, just using ones fingers {{may be the best}} option.|$|R
