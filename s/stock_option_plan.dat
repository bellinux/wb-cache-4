50|$|For instance, public {{companies}} generally grant stock options {{in accordance with}} a formal <b>stock</b> <b>option</b> <b>plan</b> approved by shareholders at an annual meeting. Many companies' stock option plans provide that stock options must be granted at an exercise price no lower than fair market value on {{the date of the}} option grant. If a company grants options on June 1 (when the stock price is $100), but backdates the options to May 15 (when the price was $80) {{in order to make the}} option grants more favorable to the grantees, the fact remains that the grants were actually made on June 1, and if the exercise price of the granted options is $80, not $100, it is below fair market value.

This paper shows the tax implications and accounting rules for <b>stock</b> <b>option</b> <b>plans.</b> By comparison of the tax and accounting rules for different compensation schemes we show that the popularity of <b>stock</b> <b>options</b> may be mainly due to the U.

Thus, for these companies the stated earnings are higher than their economical situations justify. Based on a case study of 20 companies out of the S&P 500 which rely heavily on employee <b>stock</b> <b>options</b> we arrive at the conclusion that the amount of hidden compensation cost can reach economically signifficant amounts. Since this topic seems to be widely neglected it is questionable whether stock prices reflect these hidden cost. [...] Accounting,US-GAAP,stock option programs...|$|R

In this transaction 70% of the shares went into an ESOP (Employees <b>Stock</b> <b>Option</b> <b>Plan)</b> and the remaining 30% were held by Mine Management Resources. It was {{at this time that}} an attempt was made to obtain a stock exchange listing, but it failed due to a variety of factors, including the move of mining into areas in which royalties had to be paid e.g. to AMAX in the south west area, the general decrepitude of the mining machinery and not least the start of a general crushing of the pillars and collapse in the centrally worked out areas, which was at least partially stoped by wrapping pillars with conveyor belt and old haulage rope to stabilize them. The employees subsequently sold Copper Range to Metall Mining Corporation (shortly to rename itself Inmet Mining) in 1989. After a fruitless attempt to put the mine back into profit again, Inmet closed it in 1995. Proposals to carry on mining by sulfuric acid leaching were considered but these were shelved in 1997. The mine was allowed to flood and reclamation work started. The refinery continues to operate however, and is now owned by HudBay Minerals.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} strategic {{question for}} companies today {{is how to}} recruit, motivate and retain employees. It is becoming more important to consider the incentive programs in the valuation process of companies. Recent studies show that employee stock option plans are more commonly used in Swedish companies than earlier. However, there are few studies about how employee stock options influence company performance and affect employees. The purpose of this thesis {{is to increase the}} awareness of what the introduction of an employee <b>stock</b> <b>option</b> <b>plan</b> means, both from a management perspective and from the employees’ perspective. There are many different kinds of stock option plans and the plans can vary in terms of type of options, time to expiry, exercise price and tax consequences. This study started with a pre-study of which types of employee stock option plans that are used in Swedish companies. A closer study was then carried out in four companies in different industries with different stock option plans. The motives for introducing employee stock option plans can be divided into five categories: personnel motives, incentive motives, salary motives, accounting motives and tax motives. The case studies show how motives for option plans can be dependent on different circumstances within the companies. Further, the study also shows that the consequences of the stock option plans varies according to factors such as motives, design of the <b>stock</b> <b>option</b> <b>plan,</b> share price performance and other context factors. Context factors that could have an effect are the company’s business, organisational structure, corporate culture and experiences from employee stock options in the industry, employees’ education and tax rules. The consequences for the company are also dependent on how the employees react to the options. To be able to estimate what an employee <b>stock</b> <b>option</b> <b>plan</b> means for the company, all these factors must be taken under consideration. Further one must take into account the costs for the stock options such as dilution effects, hedging costs, personnel costs and costs for designing the program.

40|$|Many studies {{carried out}} on {{employee}} <b>stock</b> <b>option</b> <b>plans</b> state that the favourable accounting treatment, even if not declared, is often {{one of the main}} goals of this form of compensation. Looking at the practice, especially in the United States, it can be observed that the accounting issue is quite relevant. There is anecdotal evidence to suggest that companies could adverse the recognition of <b>stock</b> <b>option</b> <b>plans</b> for earnings management reasons. This can be also confirmed by the recent opposition that many high-tech companies expressed to the amendment of SFAS 123, which requires the recognition of share-based payments at the fair value measured at the grant date. The same accounting treatment has been chosen by IFRS 2, which has been already approved by the EU and has been applied to Italian consolidated financial statements starting from 2005. This paper aims at determining whether there is an association between the granting of employee <b>stock</b> <b>option</b> <b>plans</b> and the adoption of earnings management practices aimed at improving the profit during the years when plans are issued. Our investigation uses the “modified Jones model” on a sample of Italian listed companies to study earnings management behaviour. This analysis can make a preliminary contribution to assess whether recognition required by IFRS 2 will imply a future reduction in the granting of <b>stock</b> <b>options</b> as incentive means. In fact, this accounting standard not only gives rise to a change in earnings figures and corporate disclosure, but could also force entities to revise their employee incentive policies. In such a perspective, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that the shift to IFRS 2 will lead companies that in the past issued <b>stock</b> <b>option</b> <b>plans</b> essentially for earnings management reasons to lessen the use of employee <b>stock</b> <b>options</b> as a form of compensation...|$|R

For some of the companies the misrepresentation of stated earnings exceeds usual immateriality limits by far.
