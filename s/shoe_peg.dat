5000|$|Maple City had its {{beginnings}} in 1866 when William Parks and J. T. Sturtevant built a <b>shoe</b> <b>peg</b> factory on land containing several hundred acres of maple timber, {{and the community}} that grew up around it was at first known as [...] "Peg Town". When applying for a post office, the name [...] "Maple" [...] was chosen, and when the post office was established on March 9, 1875, the name was given as [...] "Maple City". William H. Crowell, who had purchased the <b>shoe</b> <b>peg</b> factory in that year, was the first postmaster. The factory burned down in 1880, and in 1882, Crowell built a sawmill that operated until 1916.|$|E
25|$|Other: <b>Shoe</b> <b>pegs,</b> leather, carpet tacks, {{and many}} other solid {{materials}} have been used {{at one time or}} another in tumble or vibratory finishing for certain applications.|$|R
50|$|The 1902-1903 was {{the season}} was again a split season. There were eight first half teams: Camden Electrics, New York Wanderers, Bristol Pile Drivers, Philadelphia Phillies, Trenton Potters, Conshohocken, and Burlington <b>Shoe</b> <b>Pegs.</b> The {{second half of the}} season saw only six teams: Camden Electrics, Burlington <b>Shoe</b> <b>Pegs,</b> Wilmington Peaches, Trenton Potters, New York Wanderers, and Conshohocken. Two teams dropped out before the season finished. The Burlington team was doing so poorly that its owner-coach, Frank Reber, fired his entire team, {{purchased}} the Bristol franchise and used Bristol's players to represent Burlington. Phillies manager and future member of the Basketball Hall of Fame, Frank Morgenweck, disbanded his Phillies team to purchase the Wilmington team.|$|R
50|$|The {{area was}} once {{known for its}} large corn and potato crop, starch mills, and {{manufacturing}} (leather, <b>shoe</b> <b>pegs).</b> More recently, the town economy centered on the lumber industry. That changed in 2007, however, when the Wausau Paper Mill closed, eliminating 300 jobs.|$|R
50|$|In 1802, {{entrepreneurs}} {{built the}} first paper mill in Windham County. Two railroads converged in 1849 at Bellows Falls, helping it develop into a major mill town. By 1859, a woolen textile mill was operating, in addition to factories that produced furniture, marble, sashes and blinds, iron castings, carriages, cabinetware, rifles, harness, <b>shoe</b> <b>pegs</b> and organs. The principal products, however, were paper and farm machinery. Bellows Falls was incorporated as a village in 1909.|$|R
6000|$|At {{this moment}} the {{shutters}} {{of the front}} window, which had been closed, were opened, and Asaph put in his head. [...] "Look here, Thomas Rooper," [...] he said, [...] "these <b>shoes</b> is <b>pegged.</b> I didn't bargain for no pegged shoes; I wanted 'em sewed; everything was to be first-class." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{know not}} if Peleg kept his word with his host. It {{is said that}} the holy fathers at the Mission that night heard a loud {{chanting}} in the plaza, as of the heathens singing psalms through their noses; that for many days after an odor of salt codfish prevailed in the settlement; that a dozen hard nutmegs, which were unfit for spice or seed, {{were found in the}} possession of the wife of the baker, and that several bushels of <b>shoe</b> <b>pegs,</b> which bore a pleasing resemblance to oats, but were quite inadequate to the purposes of provender, were discovered in the stable of the blacksmith. But when the reader reflects upon the sacredness of a Yankee trader's word, the stringent discipline of the Spanish port regulations, and the proverbial indisposition of my countrymen to impose upon the confidence of a simple people, he will at once reject this part of the story.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I didn't," [...] said Asaph, sulkily; [...] "but <b>pegged</b> <b>shoes</b> is {{too much}} for any man to stand." [...] And he withdrew from the window, closing the {{shutters}} again.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to its great age, the house is notable for its ownership by inventor Paul Pillsbury, who purchased the property c. 1801. His inventions included devices for <b>pegging</b> <b>shoes,</b> milling bark off tree sections, and stripping kernels from ears of corn.|$|R
2500|$|Later, in October 1862, the {{regiment}} would draw new uniforms upon {{their return to}} Knoxville, Tennessee, after the disastrous Kentucky Campaign. Matthews describes: [...] "woolen gray jeans, jacket lined with white cotton sheathing with four C.S.A. brass buttons, a pair of unlined gray jeans pants, a while cotton sheeting shirt and drawers, and white cotton machine-knit [...] socks and pair of rough tan brogans, hand-made wooden <b>peg</b> <b>shoes...</b> Most, or all of us, had been using finger-knit woolen socks, which were sent to us from home." ...|$|R
