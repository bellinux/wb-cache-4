40|$|The <b>synaptinemal</b> <b>complex</b> {{provides}} a structural basis for four-strand crossing over: prior to chromosome pairing, both sister chromatids of each homologous chromosome {{participate in the}} genesis of one lateral component. During precise pairing, the two lateral components are combined into one <b>synaptinemal</b> <b>complex</b> per bivalent...|$|E
40|$|As {{pointed out}} in the two {{preceding}} communi-cations (Jones, Moens, this volume), the relation-ship of the <b>synaptinemal</b> <b>complex</b> to four-strand crossing-over at meiotic prophase can be explored by studying favorable cytological material, sex bivalents, chromosomal berrations, and hetero-ploids, as well as gene mutants affecting crossing-over. The available information can be briefly summarized as follows (Westergaard and yon Wettstein, 1972) : The structure and dimension of the <b>synaptinemal</b> <b>complex</b> between homologously paired chromosomes atpaehytene are as universal as is four-strand crossing-over. The behavior fthe lateral components ofthe synaptinemal complexe...|$|E
40|$|The indium trichloride {{method of}} Watson and Aldridge (38) for {{staining}} nucleic acids for electron microscopy {{was employed to}} study the relationship of DNA {{to the structure of}} the <b>synaptinemal</b> <b>complex</b> in meiotic prophase chromosomes of the domestic rooster. The selectivity of the method was demonstrated in untreated and DNase-digested testis material by comparing the distribution of indium staining in the electron microscope to Feulgen staining and ultraviolet absorption in thicker sections seen with the light microscope. Following staining by indium, DNA was found mainly in the microfibril component of the <b>synaptinemal</b> <b>complex.</b> When DNA was known to have been removed from aldehyde-fixed material by digestion with DNase, indium stainability was also lost. However, staining of the digested material with non-selective heavy metal techniques demonstrated the presence of material other than DNA in the microfibrils and showed that little alteration in appearance of the chromosome resulted from DNA removal. The two dense lateral axial elements of the <b>synaptinemal</b> <b>complex,</b> but not the central one to any extent, also contained DNA, together with non-DNA material...|$|E
40|$|At meiotic prophase, the {{grasshopper}} Chorthippus longicornis has normal <b>synaptinemal</b> <b>complexes</b> inside paired homologous chromosomes. Evidence {{is presented}} that short single cores and small multiple core complexes occur inside metaphase I chromosomes. At first anaphase, interphase, and early spermatid stage, large multiple core complexes {{are located in}} the cytoplasm. It is speculated that the multiple core complexes have some structural elements in common with the <b>synaptinemal</b> <b>complexes,</b> but that different forms of pairing behavior are exhibited by the different complexes...|$|R
40|$|Labeled spermatocytes from locusts killed 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 {{days after}} {{exposure}} to tritiated thymidine were examined with the electron microscope {{to determine their}} meiotic stage. It was found that tritiated thymidine uptake in young spermatocyte nuclei is completed some 24 hours before <b>synaptinemal</b> <b>complexes</b> are formed. It is concluded that in the locust, premeiotic DNA synthesis is completed {{well in advance of}} pairing of homologous chromosomes as marked by the formation of <b>synaptinemal</b> <b>complexes.</b> The G- 1 and the S-phase are in the order of 24 hours each, while meiotic prophase lasts four to five days under the conditions used...|$|R
40|$|Reconstruction of {{serially}} sectioned zygotene and pachytene nuclei {{has allowed}} the estimation of both the number and position of central component recombination nodules in the <b>synaptinemal</b> <b>complexes</b> of two chromosomally different strains of Neurospora crassa. In both strains the number of nodules is that expected if each nodule represents one crossover event (50 map units). The distribution of nodules within the arms of bivalents shows evidence of centromeric repulsion and telomeric localization. Nodules appear quite early in the zygotene before pairing of chromosomes is complete. Evidence was found of size differences in nodules, and multiple nodules were occasionally seen. Chromosome lengths and nuclear sizes increased from early zygotene to late pachytene. The three quadrivalents present in the alcoy translocation heterozygotes were readily distinguishable in reconstructions, and their cytological dimensions were in agreement with predictions from linkage map distances...|$|R
40|$|We {{are proposing}} a "Preselection Hypothesis" {{to account for}} the {{regulation}} of crossing-over in eukaryotic organisms. The hypothesis characterized meiosis in terms of three major physiological stages: (1) a presynaptic stage when pairs of homologous DNA stretches are selected so as to become trapped within the <b>synaptinemal</b> <b>complex</b> during synapsis, (2) an alignment of homologous chromosomes and stabilization of paired bivalents via the <b>synaptinemal</b> <b>complex,</b> and (3) a scission and rejoining of DNA stretches leading to the formation of chiasmata and crossovers. The hypothesis centers on the first stage and is based on evidence for the occurrence of significant cytological and biochemical changes prior to synapsis. The major feature of the hypothesis is that crossing-over occurs only in trapped DNA stretches. Thus, potential crossing-over sites, though not crossing-over itself, are determined well before chromosomes pair. Since, to a large degree, crossovers are distributed randomly along the length of each chromosome, the preselection process must result in a random assortment of trapped DNA stretches, the assortment differing from one meiocyte to another...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{of the structure of}} meiotic chromosomes from primary spermatocytes of two salamanders, Plethodon cinereus and Desmognathus fusca, has been made using correlated light and electron microscopy. Feulgen squashes were compared with stained sections and these related to adjacent thin sections in the electron microscope. A transition from the familiar cytological preparation to the electron image was thus effected. A linear complex consisting of three parallel strands has been observed with the electron microscope, passing along the central axis of primary spermatocyte chromosomes. The complex is similar to that found in comparable chromosomes from at least a dozen animal species. The structure in Plethodon is described in detail. Synapsis has been positively identified as the stage of meiotic prophase at which the complex occurs. Thus the complex is a part of bivalent chromosomes. It has not been seen in other stages or other divisions and is thus thought to be exclusively of synaptic occurrence. The term <b>synaptinemal</b> <b>complex</b> is suggested for the entire structure. By virtue of the material condensed around it, the complex is also seen in the light microscope where it appears as a fine, densely Feulgen-positive central core along the chromosome. The complex is thus closely associated with DNA, if not at least in part, composed of it. In the stages studied, homologous chromosomes are not always completely paired. The lateral elements of the complex separate and follow the single chromosome axes at these points. The central element disappears and thus may be a phenomenon of pairing. It is concluded that the lateral elements of the <b>synaptinemal</b> <b>complex</b> may more correctly be a "core" of the single meiotic prophase chromosome, possibly being concerned with its linear organization...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} of guppy (Poecilia reticulata) spermatogonia and spermatocytes {{has been studied}} using electron microscopy. The spermatogonia, situated {{at the apex of}} the seminiferous tubule, are almost all surrounded by a network of Sertoli cells; they have very diffuse chromatin and one or two large nucleoli. The cytoplasm contains relatively few organelles, although annulate lamellae are found. The mitochondria have few cristae and are concentrated at one pole of the cell; they are sometimes found with intermitochondrial cement. These spermatogonia are separated from each other, having no intercellular bridges or inclusion in Sertoli cells, and are relatively undifferentiated; they correspond to stem cells. The spermatogonia beneath the apex are organized into cysts. First-generation spermatogonia are more dense and heterogeneous, their nuclei becoming smaller and their chromatin becoming denser during successive generations. In spermatocytes, the <b>synaptinemal</b> <b>complex</b> exists as a modified form until metaphase. The concentration of organelles in the cytoplasm increases and the organelles become more diversified as spermatogenesis progresses. Many cytoplasmic bridges are observed (several per cell), indicating that the cells remain in contact after several divisions. These changes in germ cell structure have been related to some of the characteristic features of spermatogenesis in guppy, e. g. the large number of spermatogonial generations and the complexity of spermiogenesis...|$|E
40|$|The testis oiNucella {{consists}} of numerous tubules, all directed inwards and joining {{to form a}} common testicular duct. In a single tubule the spermatogonia lie round the periphery. Mature sperm line the lumen of the tubule. Cells in the same stage of spermatogenesis are grouped together and all {{members of a group}} pass through spermatogenesis in phase. Staining with fast green before and after treatment with Van Slyke reagent indicates a change from lysine-rich to arginine-rich histone in the maturing spermatid. Sperm of Nucella are motile throughout their length. The sperm are thread-like and about 80 ft long. The head is Feulgen-positive and about 40 fi long. The mid-piece lies behind the head and is about 8 fi long. The flagellum runs from {{the front end of the}} head to the tip of the tail; in the head it is completely surrounded by the nucleus. The spermatogonia contain two centrioles situated near the nucleus and a conspicuous Golgi <b>complex.</b> There are <b>synaptinemal</b> <b>complexes</b> in spermatocyte nuclei in the synapsis stage. In the early spermatid the centriole pushes a tube through the nucleus. This tube is lined by nuclear membrane and is occupied by the anterior portion of the flagellar shaft. The nucleus elongates and the nucleoprotein condenses into strands arranged helically along the long axis of the nucleus...|$|R
