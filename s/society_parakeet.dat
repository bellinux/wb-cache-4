50|$|The <b>Society</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Cyanoramphus ulietanus), {{also known}} as the Society kakariki or brown-headed parakeet, is an extinct parakeet of the genus Cyanoramphus.|$|E
50|$|Their closest {{relative}} is Reischek's parakeet, {{which also}} {{lives on the}} Antipodes Islands. Other relatives include the Norfolk parakeet, <b>Society</b> <b>parakeet</b> and Chatham parakeet.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Society</b> <b>parakeet</b> was {{endemic to}} Raiatea, {{the second largest}} island of the Society Islands. It was {{probably}} a forest species, as this was the native habitat on this island.|$|E
50|$|All {{the members}} of the <b>Parakeet</b> <b>Society</b> were princes. The symbol of the <b>society,</b> the <b>parakeet,</b> was {{intended}} to make fun of Louis’ coat of arms, which showed the raven of Oswald of Northumbria.|$|R
5000|$|William III (1375 in Munich [...] - [...] 12 September 1435) (German: Wilhelm III., Herzog von Bayern), was Duke of Bavaria-Munich (1397-1435), {{together}} and in concord with {{his older brother}} Ernest, Duke of Bavaria.William III was a son of John II {{and a member of}} the <b>Parakeet</b> <b>Society.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>Parakeet</b> <b>Society</b> was a {{union of}} the enemies of Louis VII the Bearded, duke of Bavaria-Ingolstadt. It was founded on April 17, 1414 by his cousin, duke Henry XVI of Bavaria-Landshut. The {{other members of the}} society were Ernest of Bavaria-Munich, his brother William III and John, Count Palatine of Neumarkt.|$|R
50|$|Like {{many other}} species of birds the Cyanoramphus parakeets have {{suffered}} from changes brought about by humans. The two species from the Society Islands, the black-fronted parakeet and the <b>Society</b> <b>parakeet,</b> have become extinct as have the subspecies from Lord Howe Island and Macquarie Island, {{as well as an}} undescribed form from Campbell Island. One species, the Malherbe's parakeet (C. malherbi), is critically endangered while most other species are endangered or vulnerable. Habitat loss and introduced species are considered responsible for the declines and extinctions.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Society</b> <b>parakeet</b> {{averaged}} 25 cm (9.75 to 10 inches) in length. Its {{head was}} chocolate brown, paler on the neck, rump, and wings. The bill showed a pale bluish grey hue {{and had a}} black tip. The lower back and tail coverts exhibited a rufous brown colouring. The underwing coverts and outer webs to flight feathers were greyish blue. The breast, abdomen, and undertail coverts were olive yellow. The mid-rectrices were olive brown and outer rectrices grey. The irises were orange red in adults and brown in juveniles. The feet were greyish brown. Males and females were not sexually dimorphic.|$|E
5000|$|Like its relative, the <b>Society</b> <b>parakeet,</b> {{the species}} {{inhabited}} woodlands, but as testified by the 1773 report of Georg Forster, {{they were able}} to persist in numbers despite widespread deforestation for agriculture and the presence of the small kiore rats and pigs, which undoubtedly preyed on the bird's eggs on occasion. The natives of Tahiti, who valued red parrot feathers for use in handicraft above all others, had to trade for these with the Samoans, as the black-fronted parakeet did not possess the desired feathers in sufficient quality and quantity. However, they liked to keep the species as pets. After the introduction of cats and European rats, the species rapidly succumbed to these predators.|$|E
50|$|Henry {{inherited}} {{not only}} the black hair of Maddalena but also the despotic temperament of her family, the Visconti. Henry oppressed very cruelly uprisings of the citizenry of Landshut in 1410 and fought successfully against his cousin Louis VII the Bearded, the duke of Bavaria-Ingolstadt. He united Louis’ enemies in the <b>Parakeet</b> <b>Society</b> of 1414 and the League of Constance of 1415.|$|R
50|$|He {{restrained}} uprisings of {{the citizenry}} of Munich in 1396 and 1410 and forced his uncle Stephen III to confine his reign to Bavaria-Ingolstadt in 1402. Afterwards Ernest still fought several times successfully against the dukes of Bavaria-Ingolstadt Stephen III and his son Louis VII the Bearded as ally of Henry XVI of Bavaria-Landshut. He {{was a member of}} the <b>Parakeet</b> <b>Society</b> and of the League of Constance.|$|R
50|$|Louis III was {{a member}} of the <b>Parakeet</b> <b>Society</b> and of the League of Constance. Highly cultured and {{religious}} he was a patron of the Heidelberg University. Louis III acted as vicar for Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor and was his bearer during the Council of Constance. As such Louis later also executed the sentences against Jan Hus and Jerome of Prague. He also arrested Antipope John XXIII in 1415.|$|R
5000|$|Henry XVI {{already had}} a dispute with Louis VII's father Stephen III. On 17 April 1414, Henry and other enemies of Louis VII founded the <b>Parakeet</b> <b>Society.</b> On 8 July 1415, the society was changed into the League of Constance, an {{alliance}} for mutual defense against Louis VII. In 1417 in Constance, Louis insulted Henry by calling him [...] "the son of a cook". When Louis then accused Henry of having shed human blood, Henry and fifteen of his followers physically attacked Louis and injured him severely. After this attack, Louis described Henry as a pluethunt ("blood hound"), which did little to defuse the conflict.|$|R
50|$|As {{brother of}} Isabella of Bavaria-Ingolstadt, wife of Charles VI of France, he {{spent several years}} in France. When he succeeded his father in 1413 he ordered to build the New Castle of Ingolstadt, which was {{strongly}} influenced by French Gothic. In 1408 Louis, William II, Duke of Bavaria-Straubing and John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy defeated the citizens of Liege who revolted against William's brother John of Bavaria, the bishop of Liège {{on the field of}} Othée. Very hot-tempered Louis was not only in conflict with his former ally John the Fearless but fought also several times against his cousin Henry XVI of Bavaria-Landshut who had united his enemies in the <b>Parakeet</b> <b>Society</b> of 1414 and the League of Constance of 1415.|$|R
50|$|Duke Henry XVI was {{the first}} of the three famous rich dukes, who reigned Bavaria-Landshut in the 15th century. Their {{residence}} was Trausnitz Castle in Landshut, a fortification which attained enormous dimensions. Having inherited not only the black hair but also the despotic temperament of the Visconti, Henry oppressed very cruelly uprisings of the citizenry of Landshut in 1410 and fought successfully against his cousin Louis VII the Bearded, the duke of Bavaria-Ingolstadt. He united Louis’ enemies in the <b>Parakeet</b> <b>Society</b> of 1414 and the League of Constance of 1415.While the duchy of Bavaria-Straubing was still divided between Bavaria-Ingolstadt, Bavaria-Munich and Bavaria-Landshut after the extinction of the dukes of Straubing in 1429, Henry managed to receive the complete duchy of Bavaria-Ingolstadt in 1447. The pest killed Henry in 1450, he was succeeded by his son Louis IX the Rich.|$|R
40|$|We studied {{zoonotic}} {{transmission of}} Chlamydophila psittaci in 39 breeding facilities for Psittaciformes (cockatoos, parrots, parakeets, lories) that frequently used antimicrobial drugs. Genotypes A or E/B were detected in 14. 9 % of humans at these facilities. Information on antimicrobial {{drug use in}} Psittaciformes and a C. psittaci vaccine are urgently required. Chlamydophila psittaci, an obligate, intracellular, gramnegative bacterium, has 7 known genotypes (A–F and E/B) (1), All genotypes can be transmitted to humans and cause psittacosis or parrot fever (2). Genotypes are distinguished by sequencing of the outer membrane protein A (ompA) gene (3) or by a recently developed ompA genotype-specific real-time PCR (4). C. psittaci can infect 465 avian species in 30 avian orders, with at least 153 species in the order Psittaciformes (5). From 1988 through 2003, a total of 935 human cases of psittacosis were reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (6); most were related to contact with Psittaciformes. Currently, ≈ 100 psittacosis cases are reported annually in the United States, and 1 person may die of this disease each year. The incidence of psittacosis in men seems to be increasing in industrialized countries and is related to importation of exotic birds. Other cases may not be correctly diagnosed or reported. The Study We investigated zoonotic transmission of C. psittaci in Belgian breeding facilities for Psittaciformes (cockatoos, parrots, parakeets, lories). Participants were recruited through the Belgian <b>Society</b> for <b>Parakeet</b> and Parrot Breeders. Fifty breeding facilities received a sampling package by regular mail. The package contained a questionnair...|$|R
50|$|Frederick {{resumed his}} rule of Ansbach in 1409 and after heavy feuding, {{entered into the}} service of King Sigismund. In 1410, the death of Rupert, King of the Germans, left the throne of the Holy Roman Empire vacant. Sigismund enlisted Frederick's help in obtaining the throne. At the time, Jobst of Moravia ruled Brandenburg and thus {{was one of the}} prince-electors who had the right to vote for the new king. However, Sigismund disputed Jobst's claim to Brandenburg and his right to vote in the {{imperial}} election. Sigismund claimed these rights for himself and designated Frederick to represent him as elector of Brandenburg in the imperial election of 20 September 1410. While Sigismund won this initial vote, Jobst of Moravia won the support of a majority of electors in an election in October 1410 and himself claimed the imperial throne. Jobst's death under suspicious circumstances in January 1411 cleared the way for Sigismund's recovery of Brandenburg and his undisputed election as king of the empire later that year. In gratitude for Frederick's services, King Sigismund made him Oberster Hauptmann and Verwalter der Marken (1411). With an iron hand Frederick fought against the rebellious nobility of the March of Brandenburg (in particular, the Quitzow family) and, in the end, restored security. Frederick also {{became a member of the}} <b>Parakeet</b> <b>Society</b> and of the League of Constance.|$|R
