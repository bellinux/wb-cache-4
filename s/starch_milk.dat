40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{explore the}} {{feasibility}} and implementation efficiency of Nutritional Report Cards (NRCs) in helping children make healthier food choices at school. METHODS: Pilot testing {{was conducted in}} a rural New York school district (K- 12). Over a five-week period, 27 parents received a weekly e-mail containing a NRC listing how many meal components (fruits, vegetables, <b>starches,</b> <b>milk),</b> snacks, and a-la-carte foods their child selected. We analyzed choices {{of students in the}} NRC group vs. the control group, both prior to and during the intervention period. Point-of-sale system data for a-la-carte items was analyzed using Generalized Least Squares regressions with clustered standard errors. RESULTS: NRCs encouraged more home conversations about nutrition and more awareness of food selections. Despite the small sample, the NRC was associated with reduced selection of some items, such as the percentage of those selecting cookies which decreased from 14. 3 to 6. 5 percent. Additionally, despite requiring new keys on the check-out registers to generate the NRC, checkout times increased by only 0. 16 seconds per transaction, and compiling and sending the NRCs required a total weekly investment of 30 minutes of staff time.

40|$|Objective: The {{aim of this}} {{qualitative}} study was to test the comprehensibility of the preliminary food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG) for healthy South African children aged 1 - 7 years. Objectives included assessing exposure to FBDG, comprehension of the proposed paediatric FBDG (PFBDG) and whether the guidelines {{can be used in}} meal planning. Design: Focus group discussions were used to collect data. Discussions were facilitated by the investigator in either English or Afrikaans, according to a predetermined discussion schedule. Focus groups were formed on the basis of language and socio-economic status (SES). Setting: Areas within the City of Cape Town representing lower, middle and upper SES groups. Subjects: A total of seventy-six English- and Afrikaans-speaking mothers were contacted via randomly selected consenting preschool groups to participate voluntarily. Results: Most mothers reported that they do not use guidelines. They had a good grasp of the concepts of and need for PFBDG. They suggested slight alterations to wording/phrasing of the guidelines. The most problematic guidelines were those regarding <b>starch,</b> <b>milk</b> and sweet treats/drinks. No substantial differences were found between English and Afrikaans data. Differences were found between SES groups, with the upper SES groups comprehending the guidelines better. Conclusion: The proposed PFBDG were well received. The target population that would benefit the most from these guidelines would be the less educated, lower SES groups.

40|$|The {{study of}} powder flow {{behavior}} {{is essential for}} the development of processing technologies in many industries. In fact, powders have a major function in diverse types of manufacturing, such as pharmaceuticals, foods, chemicals, materials, minerals and cosmetics. This leads to an increasing demand for the development of reliable methods to assess powder flow problems in industry. This research intends to provide a general insight into how surface interactions and particle properties may alter powder flowability. The materials used for this study were lactose, <b>starch,</b> <b>milk</b> powder, cocoa and chocolate. These vary in their interparticle forces as well as on their manufacturing process. Powder flow behavior of these materials was measured by using a 502 Twin Drive Anton Paar Modular Compact Rheometer. The collected sets of data were used to identify how particle characteristics affect powder flow behavior. The results suggest that powder flow is affected by a combination of particle size, morphology, environmental conditions and composition. The obtained flowability profiles were compared with previous results obtained using the Freeman FT 4 Powder Rheometer. Although the flow tendency is somewhat similar, the results have some differences that are attributed to the principle of operation of each of the measurement systems. The findings represent a starting point for the understanding of particle interactions involved in complex materials. It is envisioned that the results will assist in the development of models to predict how to alter particle characteristics, using processing techniques and additives, in order to tune in a desired powder flow behavior...|$|E
40|$|This study {{compared}} the functional properties of three taro starches extracted from selected cultivars, one {{from each of}} the three most commonly grown taro genera in Tonga. The selected cultivars were Alocasia macrorrhiza var 'Fohenga', Colocasia esculenta var 'Lau'ila', and Xanthosoma saggitifolium var 'Mahele'uli'. Cassava starch, a commercial product from Thailand, was studied together with the taro starches for comparison purposes. Freshly harvested taro corms/cormels were peeled, washed, ground into pulp. The taro pulp was washed with excess water and filtered with a cheese cloth. The solid pulp was discarded, and the water-starch mixture (<b>starch</b> <b>milk)</b> was collected in a settling tank. The starch was held for 10 - 24 hours to allow the starch to settle, and then the supernatant liquid was discarded. The Xanthosoma starch was successfully isolated using this method. For the Alocasia and Colocasia, the starch could not be isolated from the <b>starch</b> <b>milk</b> due to the presence of a mucilaginous material, and it was separated using a bowl centrifuge. The starches were dried, in a hot-air drier and then purified to remove trace of protein, fat, and fibre. All the taro starch granules were similarly polygonal in shape but the granule sizes were different. The Xanthosoma starch granule size (5 - 30 μm) was similar to that of cassava starch granules (5 - 35 μm). The granule sizes of Alocasia (0. 5 - 3 μm) and Colocasia (0. 5 - 6 μm) were very small, smaller than rice starch granules. The amylose contents, determined using an iodometric blue value colorimetry method, were 12. 1, 13. 6, 19. 8, and 27. 4 % for Alocasia, Colocasia, cassava, and Xanthosoma starches respectively. The gelatinization temperatures for the starches were determined using sensory evaluation, hot stage microscopy, Brabender Amylograph, and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) methods. The gelatinization temperatures were approximately 69, 70, 75 and 80 °C for cassava, Alocasia, Xanthosoma and Colocasia starches respectively. The gelatinization temperature ranges for Xanthosoma and Colocasia were similar to that of cassava starch, but Alocasia starch showed relatively wider temperature range. The viscosity of the Xanthosoma gelatinized starch paste was much higher than the other starches but showed greater breakdown on heating. The strengths of the starch gels were determined by measuring the rheological modulus G* of the gels using a Bohlin Rheometer, and the penetration strength test using an Instron. Both tests showed that the Xanthosoma starch produced a much stronger and higher viscosity gel than all of the cassava, Alocasia and Colocasia starches which produced gels with similar strength. The relative order of gel clarity from qualitative sensory evaluation, from highest to poorest clarity, was cassava, Xanthosoma, Colocasia, then Alocasia. The storage stability of the starch gels was evaluated by studying the crystallisation using DSC, and measuring the syneresis occurring during storage at 5 and 22 °C. The Xanthosoma starch gel was extremely susceptible to crystallisation and syneresis during storage, compared with cassava, Colocasia, and Alocasia gels which had similar stabilities on storage. The freeze-thaw stability of the starch gels was studied by subjecting the starch gels to repeated freeze-thaw cycles. The Xanthosoma starch gel was extremely unstable with freeze-thaw treatment. The Alocasia and Colocasia starch gels were similar to cassava starch gel which was more stable with freeze-thaw treatment. The Xanthosoma starch, because of extremely high viscosity and gel strength, could be used in food products that need high viscous texture but require no further storage. The Colocasia and Alocasia starches, because of high digestibility due to very small granule sizes can be used in baby food formulations, which are either heat treated or frozen...|$|E
