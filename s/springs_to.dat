5|$|In 1911, {{the road}} between Leonardtown and Mechanicsville and from south of Camp <b>Springs</b> <b>to</b> the Washington, D.C. border was {{completed}} {{as a state}} highway while the sections between south of Beantown and the border between Charles and Prince George's counties and between TB and Camp Springs were under contract. At this time, the road between Point Lookout and Leonardtown, Mechanicsville and Beantown, and the Charles-Prince George's county border and TB were proposed as state highways. By 1915, {{the entire length of}} the state highway between north of Point Lookout and the Washington, D.C. border was completed. This state highway was paved to the northwest of Leonardtown, between north of Morganza and Hughesville, between the Charles-Prince George's county border and north of TB, and from south of Camp <b>Springs</b> <b>to</b> the Washington, D.C. border while the remainder was an unpaved state road.|$|E
5|$|MS 311 was {{designated}} in 1957 for {{a gravel road}} connecting Holly <b>Springs</b> <b>to</b> Mt. Pleasant. By 1960, the route was paved except for a small portion halfway between Holly Springs and Mt. Pleasant. In 1965, the remaining portion of MS 311 was paved.|$|E
5|$|The DB9 also {{contains}} anti-roll bars and double wishbone suspension, supported by coil <b>springs.</b> <b>To</b> keep the back-end in control under heavy acceleration or braking, the rear suspension has additional anti-squat and anti-lift technology. Later {{versions of the}} car also features three modes for the tuning: normal, for every-day use, sport, for more precise movement {{at the cost of}} ride comfort, and track, which furthers the effects of the sport setting.|$|E

50|$|<b>Spring</b> <b>to</b> <b>Spring</b> {{trail is}} a multi-use trail in Volusia County, Florida. It is under {{development}} and {{plans call for}} it to cover 26 miles. The trail will connect Gemini <b>Springs</b> Park <b>to</b> DeLeon <b>Springs</b> State Park.|$|R

5|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary film critics. After {{the release of}} the film in June 1941, Columbia allowed the release of two more Medico films, Thunder Over the Prairie (July 1941) and Prairie Stranger (September 1941). Starrett, who went on to star in around sixty other western flicks, found The Medico of Painted <b>Springs</b> <b>to</b> be his favorite film. The film has many noticeable differences from Rubel's original work.|$|E
5|$|The first Colorado {{portion of}} I-70 opened to traffic in 1961. This section {{bypassed}} and linked Idaho <b>Springs</b> <b>to</b> the junction where US6 currently separates from I-70 {{west of the}} city. The majority of the alignment through Denver was completed by 1964. The Mousetrap reused some structures that were built in 1951, before {{the formation of the}} Interstate Highway system. The last piece east of Denver opened to traffic in 1977.|$|E
5|$|Alex Funke, {{who worked}} on The Lord of the Rings, {{directed}} the film's miniatures unit. These include 1/24th and 1/100th scale miniatures of Miraz's castle. A scale model was built of the Narnians' cave hideouts during the climactic battle, which the actor playing the giant Wimbleweather was filmed against. One of the improvements made over the previous film {{was to make the}} centaurs walk during dialogue scenes, so Cornell John as Glenstorm wore Power Risers (mechanical stilts with <b>springs),</b> <b>to</b> mimic a horse's canter and height. The animatronic Minotaur heads were also improved to properly lip sync, although this was not as successful as hoped and had to be revamped digitally.|$|E

5|$|Although Chell is {{equipped}} with mechanized heel <b>springs</b> <b>to</b> prevent damage from falling, she can be killed by various other hazards in the test chambers, such as turret guns, bouncing balls of energy, and toxic liquid. She can also be killed by objects falling through portals, and {{by a series of}} crushers that appear in certain levels. Unlike most action games at the time, there is no health indicator; Chell dies if she is dealt a certain amount of damage in a short time period, but returns to full health fairly quickly. Some obstacles, such as the energy balls and crushing pistons, deal fatal damage with a single blow.|$|E
5|$|At 2100UTC on August24, a {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for all of Florida south of the Jupiter Inlet {{on the east coast}} and south of Bonita Springs on the west coast; it also included Lake Okeechobee and the Florida Keys. Early on the next day, the tropical storm watch was upgraded to a warning, while the Florida Keys and the mainland from Ocean Reef to Bonita Springs were placed under a hurricane watch. Further north, {{a tropical}} storm watch was issued from the Jupiter Inlet to the Sebastian Inlet. Later on August25, the hurricane watch was switched to a warning, while a separate hurricane watch was issued from Golden Beach southward. At 1500UTC on August25, the tropical storm warning was extended northward to Sebastian Inlet. In addition, {{a tropical storm}} watch was issued further north from Sebastian Inlet to Flagler Beach on the east coast and Bonita <b>Springs</b> <b>to</b> Tarpon Springs on the west coast. About six hours later, the tropical storm watch along the west coast of Florida was extended northward to the mouth of the Suwannee River on August25. The tropical storm watch, which now stretched from Bonita <b>Springs</b> <b>to</b> Tarpon Springs, was extended to Indian Pass on August26. Simultaneously, a hurricane watch was issued {{from the mouth of the}} Mississippi River in Louisiana to Indian Pass, Florida.|$|E
5|$|Highway 82 {{was now a}} four-lane road all the {{way from}} Glenwood <b>Springs</b> <b>to</b> Aspen. But that traffic still had to narrow to two lanes to cross the Maroon Creek Bridge at the latter city's western boundary. The old bridge, listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1985, was {{functionally}} obsolete and structurally deficient. Cracks and other damage were forcing temporary closures of the bridge to trucks. Over 100 years old by that point, the oldest bridge in use on a Colorado highway, it could not be expanded any further.|$|E

5|$|In 1566, {{the capital}} city of Valletta was founded on the Sciberras Peninsula, which did not have a good water supply. Rainwater {{collected}} within the city was not enough {{to meet the needs of}} its population. Water had to be carted from <b>springs</b> <b>to</b> the city, but this became difficult by the end of the 16th century, when the city had become the largest settlement in Malta. At the time, there were also fears of an Ottoman attack on Malta, so a steady water supply to the capital was a priority for the military authorities in the case of a siege.|$|E
5|$|It {{is often}} claimed {{that at the}} time, the pass of Thermopylae {{consisted}} of a track along {{the shore of the}} Malian Gulf so narrow that only one chariot could pass through at a time. In fact, as noted below, the pass was 100 metres wide, probably wider than the Greeks could have held against the Persian hordes. Herodotus reports that the Phocians had improved the defenses of the pass by channelling the stream from the hot <b>springs</b> <b>to</b> create a marsh, and it was a causeway across this marsh which was only wide enough for a single chariot to traverse. In a later passage, describing a Gaulish attempt to force the pass, Herodotus describes how the Gauls who fell into the marsh disappeared and were drowned.|$|E
5|$|NY47, meanwhile, {{became part}} of the new NY8 in the 1930 renumbering, {{allowing}} the NY47 designation to be reassigned to a previously unnumbered roadway along the western shore of Lake George between NY8 in Hague and US9 in Lake George village. At the same time, NY10 was realigned south of Long Lake and replaced with NY9K from Saratoga <b>Springs</b> <b>to</b> Lake George while the roadway connecting Ticonderoga to Westport {{became part of}} NY22 after NY30 was reassigned elsewhere in the state. The segment of modern NY9N from Westport to Elizabethtown, previously unnumbered, was designated NY195.|$|E

5|$|The River Hull is a {{navigable river}} in the East Riding of Yorkshire in Northern England. It rises {{from a series of}} <b>springs</b> <b>to</b> the west of Driffield, and enters the Humber estuary at Kingston upon Hull. Following a period when the Archbishops of York charged tolls for its use, it became a free navigation. The upper reaches became part of the Driffield Navigation from 1770, after which they were again subject to tolls, and the section within the city of Hull came under the {{jurisdiction}} of the Port of Hull, with the same result.|$|E
5|$|The {{source of}} the River Hull is in the Yorkshire Wolds. It rises {{from a series of}} <b>springs</b> <b>to</b> the west of Driffield, near the site of the medieval village of Elmswell. The Elmswell Beck flows eastwards from these, and is joined by the Little Driffield Beck, which flows southwards from Little Driffield. It {{continues}} as the Driffield Beck, flowing around the south-western edge of Driffield, where it is joined by the Driffield Trout Stream. After the junction, it becomes the River Hull or the West Beck and flows to the east, before turning south to reach Corps Landing. For much of the route below Driffield, the Driffield Navigation runs parallel to the river.|$|E
5|$|There Business 80 splits to the north, SR 99 heads south, and US 50 {{continues}} east as the Lincoln Highway. This freeway parallels Folsom Boulevard and the American River east-northeasterly {{through the}} suburb of Rancho Cordova to Folsom. Entering El Dorado, US 50 continues eastward through {{the foothills of}} the Sierra Nevada via El Dorado Hills, Cameron Park, and Shingle <b>Springs</b> <b>to</b> downtown Placerville. The freeway ends, and US 50 has several at-grade intersections in Placerville, including SR 49.|$|E

5|$|Two {{sections}} {{of what is}} now NY167 were included as part of legislative routes when the New York State Legislature created a statewide legislative route system in 1908. From Richfield <b>Springs</b> <b>to</b> Paines Hollow, it was designated as part of Route5, which continued southeast to Kingston via Oneonta and northwest to Mohawk. The section {{of what is now}} NY167 north of Little Falls became part of Route26, which ran from Little Falls to Remsen via Dolgeville. In 1910, Route26 was realigned to follow a more direct routing between Little Falls and Remsen via Middleville and Poland. The former alignment of Route26 between Little Falls and Dolgeville went unnumbered until March1, 1921, when it became part of Route37, which was extended southwestward from Dolgeville to Little Falls.|$|E
5|$|At the Los Angeles International Speedway, McQueen's mind is {{not fully}} set on the race, and he soon falls into last place. He is {{surprised}} to discover that Doc Hudson, who is decked out in his old racing colors, has taken over as his crew chief, along with several other friends from Radiator <b>Springs</b> <b>to</b> help in the pit. Inspired and recalling tricks he learned from Doc and his friends, McQueen quickly emerges to lead the race into the final laps. But at the last minute, Hicks, refusing to come behind Weathers again, side swipes Weathers, and sends him into a dangerous spin, causing him to crash. Seeing this and recalling Doc's fate, McQueen stops just short of the finish line, allowing Hicks to win, and drives back to push Weathers over the finish line. The crowd and media condemn Hicks' victory, but are nonetheless impressed with McQueen's sportsmanship. Though offered the Dinoco sponsorship deal, McQueen declines, insisting on staying with Rusteze as an appreciation of their past support. Later, back at Radiator Springs, McQueen returns and announces that he will be setting up his headquarters there, helping to put Radiator Springs back on the map.|$|E
5|$|Fort Yellowstone was a U.S. Army fort, {{established}} in 1891 at Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone was designated in 1872 but the Interior Department {{was unable to}} effectively manage the park. Administration {{was transferred to the}} War Department in August 1886 and General Philip Sheridan sent a company of cavalry to Mammoth Hot <b>Springs</b> <b>to</b> build a cavalry post. The army originally called the post Camp Sheridan in honor of General Sheridan but the name was changed to Fort Yellowstone in 1891 when construction of the permanent fort commenced. The army administered the park until 1918 when it was transferred to the newly created National Park Service. The facilities of Fort Yellowstone now comprise the Yellowstone National Park headquarters, the Horace Albright Visitor Center and staff accommodations.|$|E
