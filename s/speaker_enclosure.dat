5|$|The Isobarik is {{so named}} as it employs the {{isobaric}} loading principle invented by Harry Olson in the 1950s: two bass units are mounted {{in a sealed}} container and driven in parallel so as to effectively double the <b>speaker</b> <b>enclosure</b> volume and extend its bass frequency response beyond what would be possible for otherwise identical speakers. Linn used {{a variant of the}} isobaric principle and patented the use of two bass drive units ("woofers") facing forward in an isobaric arrangement in early 1974.|$|E
25|$|Loudspeaker {{efficiency}} {{is defined as}} the sound power output divided by the electrical power input. Most loudspeakers are inefficient transducers; only about 1% of the electrical energy sent by an amplifier to a typical home loudspeaker is converted to acoustic energy. The remainder is converted to heat, mostly in the voice coil and magnet assembly. The main reason for this is the difficulty of achieving proper impedance matching between the acoustic impedance of the drive unit and the air it radiates into. (At low frequencies, improving this match is the main purpose of <b>speaker</b> <b>enclosure</b> designs). The efficiency of loudspeaker drivers varies with frequency as well. For instance, the output of a woofer driver decreases as the input frequency decreases because of the increasingly poor match between air and the driver.|$|E
500|$|A {{subwoofer}} (or sub) is a woofer, or {{a complete}} loudspeaker, which {{is dedicated to}} the reproduction of low-pitched audio frequencies known as bass. The typical frequency range for a subwoofer is about 20–200Hz for consumer products, below 100Hz for professional live sound, and below 80Hz in THX-approved systems. Subwoofers are intended to augment the low frequency range of loudspeakers covering higher frequency bands. While the term [...] "subwoofer" [...] technically only refers to the speaker driver, in common parlance, the term often refers to a subwoofer driver mounted in a <b>speaker</b> <b>enclosure</b> (cabinet).|$|E

2500|$|Another {{alternative}} are powered speakers with an amplifier {{built into}} the <b>speaker</b> <b>enclosure.</b> [...] Since the amplifier {{is at the same}} location as the speaker, the speaker requires only a line level audio signal as an input. [...] Line level signals are typically around 1-2 volts, and can be transmitted over much smaller cable (typically 20-26 AWG). The main disadvantage of powered loudspeakers is that they have the additional requirement of requiring AC power, whereas passive speakers have no such requirement.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} {{accessories}} {{are designed for}} the bass drum (also called [...] "kick drum"). Ported tubes for the bass drum are available {{to take advantage of}} the bass reflex speaker design, in which a tuned port (a hole and a carefully measured tube) are put in a <b>speaker</b> <b>enclosure</b> to improve the bass response at the lowest frequencies. Bass drumhead patches are available, which protect the drumhead from the impact of the felt beater. Bass drum pillows are fabric bags with filling or stuffing that can be used to alter the tone or resonance of the bass drum. A less expensive alternative to using a specialized bass drum pillow is to use an old sleeping bag.|$|E
2500|$|A woofer is {{a driver}} that reproduces low frequencies. The driver {{works with the}} {{characteristics}} of the enclosure to produce suitable low frequencies (see <b>speaker</b> <b>enclosure</b> for some of the design choices available). Indeed, both are so closely connected that they must be considered together in use. [...] Only at design time do the separate properties of enclosure and woofer matter individually. Some loudspeaker systems use a woofer for the lowest frequencies, sometimes well enough that a subwoofer is not needed. Additionally, some loudspeakers use the woofer to handle middle frequencies, eliminating the mid-range driver. This can be accomplished with the selection of a tweeter that can work low enough that, combined with a woofer that responds high enough, the two drivers add coherently in the middle frequencies.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, {{high quality}} home {{loudspeakers}} were exclusively large and floor-standing <b>speaker</b> <b>enclosures,</b> whereas small <b>speaker</b> cabinets had reputation of low price and low audio quality. However, {{beginning in the}} 1960s, some manufacturers began making more expensive, compact high fidelity speakers. The demand for smaller speakers was from hifi enthusiasts who lived in small apartments, {{who did not have}} space for large <b>speaker</b> <b>enclosures.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Speakers are {{typically}} {{housed in a}} <b>speaker</b> <b>enclosure</b> or speaker cabinet which is often a rectangular or square box made of wood or sometimes plastic. The enclosure's materials and design [...] {{play an important role}} in the quality of the sound. [...] Where high fidelity reproduction of sound is required, multiple loudspeaker transducers are often mounted in the same enclosure, each reproducing a part of the audible frequency range (picture at right). [...] In this case the individual speakers are referred to as [...] "drivers" [...] and the entire unit is called a loudspeaker. [...] Drivers made for reproducing high audio frequencies are called tweeters, those for middle frequencies are called mid-range drivers, and those for low frequencies are called woofers. Smaller loudspeakers are found in devices such as radios, televisions, portable audio players, computers, and electronic musical instruments [...] Larger loudspeaker systems are used for music, sound reinforcement in theatres and concerts, and in public address systems.|$|E

50|$|Passive {{radiators}} {{are considered}} to be similar in design to bass reflex systems, which use a port or vent cut into the speaker cabinet. Both bass reflex and passive radiator approaches are used with the same goal: to obtain better deep pitch sound from the system. Bass reflex is the most widely used technique for obtaining deeper bass notes from a <b>speaker</b> <b>enclosure.</b> Passive radiator designs are the next most-used approach to obtain deeper bass notes from a cabinetOne metaphor used to explain how PR systems work is to think of the air in the <b>speaker</b> <b>enclosure</b> like a spring.Sound on Sound Technical Editor Hugh Robjohns states that PR systems seem to be sealed up, like a sealed <b>speaker</b> <b>enclosure,</b> but in fact, he argues that because the drone cone(s) move in and out, a PR system is not really sealed. Robjohns states that the effect created by installing a PR in a speaker cabinet is basically creating a bigger tube, as with a bass reflex system. AE Speakers states that a PR is not a sealed box enclosure.|$|E

5000|$|The passive {{radiator}} usually has some means to adjust its mass (e.g., by adding {{weight to the}} cone), thereby allowing the speaker designer to change the <b>speaker</b> <b>enclosure</b> [...] "tuning".

500|$|In rare cases, sound {{reinforcement}} subwoofer enclosures {{are also}} used for bass instrument amplification by electric bass players and synth bass players. For most bands and most small- to mid-size venues (e.g., nightclubs and bars), standard bass guitar <b>speaker</b> <b>enclosures</b> or keyboard amplifiers will provide sufficient sound pressure levels for onstage monitoring. Since a regular electric bass has a low [...] "E" [...] (41Hz) as its lowest note, most standard bass guitar cabinets are only designed with a range that goes down to about 40Hz. However, in some cases, performers wish to have extended sub-bass response that is not available from standard instrument <b>speaker</b> <b>enclosures,</b> so they use subwoofer cabinets. Just as some electric guitarists add huge stacks of guitar cabinets mainly for show, some bassists will add immense subwoofer cabinets with 18-inch woofers mainly for show, and the extension sub cabinets will be operated at a lower volume than the main bass cabinets.|$|R
2500|$|With sound {{reinforcement}} system, PA {{system and}} instrument amplifier <b>speaker</b> <b>enclosures,</b> cables and {{some type of}} jack or connector are typically used.

50|$|To {{intentionally}} create feedback, {{an electric}} guitar player needs a guitar amplifier and a loudspeaker cabinet, with the volume turned up very loud and the guitar brought near the speaker. The guitarist then allows the open strings to vibrate freely and brings the guitar {{close to the}} <b>speaker</b> <b>enclosure</b> of the guitar amp. The use of distortion effects units also facilitates the creation of intentional feedback.|$|E
5000|$|Guitar {{amplifiers}} {{are typically}} designed {{to withstand a}} lot of abuse both electrically and physically (since guitarists often travel to gigs, etc.) In large systems the amplifier is separate from the <b>speaker</b> <b>enclosure(s),</b> but in smaller systems it is often integrated, forming a so-called [...] "combo".
