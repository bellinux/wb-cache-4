Speck claims that [...] "Macaulay's reputation as an historian has never fully recovered from the condemnation it implicitly received in Herbert Butterfield's devastating attack on The Whig Interpretation of History. Though he was never cited by name, {{there can be no doubt}} that Macaulay answers to the charges brought against Whig historians, particularly that they study the past with reference to the present, class people in the past as those who furthered progress and those who hindered it, and judge them accordingly". Speck also said that Macaulay too often [...] "denies the past has its own validity, treating it as being merely a prelude to his own age. This is especially noticeable in the third chapter of his History of England, when again and again he contrasts the backwardness of 1685 with the advances achieved by 1848. Not only does this misuse the past, it also leads him to exaggerate the differences".

6000|$|This deputy of {{the nineteenth}} century added to his gifts a {{capacity}} for speculation on general topics. He delighted in running through the range of practical, of literary, and of abstract questions. His opinion is always original, and to the purpose. On the voyage to Egypt, he liked, after dinner, to fix on three or four persons to <b>support</b> <b>a</b> <b>proposition,</b> and as many to oppose it. He gave a subject, and the discussions turned on questions of religion, the different kinds of government, and the art of war. One day, he asked, whether the planets were inhabited? On another, what was the age of the world? Then he proposed to consider the probability of the destruction of the globe, either by water or by fire; at another time, the truth or fallacy of presentiments, and the interpretation of dreams. He was very fond of talking of religion. In 1806, he conversed with Fournier, bishop of Montpelier, on matters of theology. There were two points on which they could not agree, viz., that of hell, and that of salvation out of the pale of the church. The Emperor told Josephine, that he disputed like a devil on these two points, on which the bishop was inexorable. To the philosophers he readily yielded all that was proved against religion as the work of men and time; but he would not hear of materialism. One fine night, on deck, amid a clatter of materialism, Bonaparte pointed to the stars, and said, [...] "You may talk as long as you please, gentlemen, but who made all that?" [...] He delighted in the conversation of men of science, particularly of Monge and Berthollet; but the men of letters he slighted; [...] "they were manufacturers of phrases." [...] Of medicine, too, he was fond of talking, and with those of its practitioners whom he most esteemed,-with Corvisart at Paris, and with Antonomarchi at St. Helena. [...] "Believe me, [...] "he said to the last, [...] "we had better leave off all these remedies: life is a fortress which neither you nor I know anything about. Why throw obstacles in the way of its defense? Its own means are superior to all the apparatus of your laboratories. Corvisart candidly agreed with me, that all your filthy mixtures are good for nothing. Medicine is a collection of uncertain prescriptions, the results of which, taken collectively, are more fatal than useful to mankind. Water, air, and cleanliness, are the chief articles in my pharmacopeia." ...|$|E
6000|$|I answered, as I thought, in this way: that I am not {{generally}} {{opposed to the}} acquisition of additional territory, and that I would <b>support</b> <b>a</b> <b>proposition</b> for the acquisition of additional territory according as my supporting it was or was not calculated to aggravate this slavery question amongst us. I then proposed to Judge Douglas another interrogatory, which was correlative to that: [...] "Are you in favor of acquiring additional territory, in disregard of how it may affect us upon the slavery question?" [...] Judge Douglas answered,--that is, {{in his own way}} he answered it. I believe that, although he took a good many words to answer it, it was a little more fully answered than any other. The substance of his answer was that this country would continue to expand; that it would need additional territory; that it was as absurd to suppose that we could continue upon our present territory, enlarging in population as we are, as it would be to hoop a boy twelve years of age, and expect him to grow to man's size without bursting the hoops. I believe it was something like that. Consequently, he was in favor of the acquisition of further territory as fast as we might need it, in disregard of how it might affect the slavery question. I do not say this as giving his exact language, but he said so substantially; and he would leave the question of slavery, where the territory was acquired, to be settled by the people of the acquired territory. ["That's the doctrine."] May be it is; let us consider that for a while. This will probably, in the run of things, become one of the concrete manifestations of this slavery question. If Judge Douglas's policy upon this question succeeds, and gets fairly settled down, until all opposition is crushed out, the next thing will be a grab for the territory of poor Mexico, an invasion of the rich lands of South America, then the adjoining islands will follow, each one of which promises additional slave-fields. And this question is to be left to the people of those countries for settlement. When we get Mexico, I don't know whether the Judge will be in favor of the Mexican people that we get with it settling that question for themselves and all others; because we know the Judge has a great horror for mongrels, and I understand that the people of Mexico are most decidedly a race of mongrels. I understand that there is not more than one person there out of eight who is pure white, and I suppose from the Judge's previous declaration that when we get Mexico, or any considerable portion of it, that he will be in favor of these mongrels settling the question, which would bring him somewhat into collision with his horror of an inferior race.|$|E

40|$|A long-standing {{debate in}} the {{economics}} of art and culture {{is concerned with the}} adequacy or otherwise of the theory of value in economics to capture a full representation of the value of cultural phenomena. At a theoretical level it has been proposed that a distinct form of value is embodied in or yielded by cultural goods and services that is related to, but not synonymous with, the goods' economic value. This form of value, termed cultural value, is congruent with the concepts of the value of art works that are discussed in aesthetics and the philosophy of art. Although the parallel existence of economic and cultural value can be proposed in theory, {{there is little or no}} empirical evidence to <b>support</b> <b>a</b> <b>proposition</b> that they are distinct phenomena or to explore the possible relationship between them.

We also ask whether it is possible to identify separate concepts of individualistic and collective value for cultural goods as expressed by an individual, where the former relates solely to the person's own utility and the latter to some more disinterested view of value to the community or society in general.

Evidence in <b>support</b> of such <b>a</b> <b>proposition</b> is presented. For each fixed value of t, there can be only {{a finite number of}} minimal counterexamples. These counterexamples are characterized based on Kempe chains, connectivity, cutsets and degree bounds. It is proved that minimal counterexamples must, if any exist, be both 4 -vertex-connected and t-edge-connected. The t = 5 case is examined in additional detail. The historical context and probable difficulty of settling this conjecture, as well as specific hurdles to its final resolution, are also discussed...|$|R

"The dissent reads into Chief Justice Marshall's {{opinion in}} Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch 75 (1807), <b>support</b> for <b>a</b> <b>proposition</b> that the Chief Justice did not endorse, either {{explicitly}} or implicitly. See post, at 14—15. He did note that [...] "the first {{congress of the}} United States" [...] acted under [...] "the immediate influence" [...] of the injunction provided by the Suspension Clause when it gave [...] "life and activity" [...] to [...] "this great constitutional privilege" [...] in the Judiciary Act of 1789, and that the writ could not be suspended until after the statute was enacted. 4 Cranch, at 95. That statement, however, surely {{does not imply that}} Marshall believed the Framers had drafted a Clause that would proscribe a temporary abrogation of the writ, while permitting its permanent suspension. Indeed, Marshall's comment expresses the far more sensible view that the Clause was intended to preclude any possibility that [...] "the privilege itself would be lost" [...] by either the inaction or the action of Congress. See, e.g., ibid. (noting that the Founders [...] "must have felt, with peculiar force, the obligation" [...] imposed by the Suspension Clause)." ...|$|R
40|$|Assessment {{has been}} called the most {{important}} element of pedagogy. The significant personal investment that Creative Writing students often have in their submissions introduces another factor for consideration. For this cohort, if not more generally, written feedback would appear to be inferior to assessment provided in recorded-voice form. Analysis of the results of a small-scale case study conducted by the author <b>supports</b> this claim. <b>A</b> <b>proposition</b> by Susan Sontag, that hearing provides a better way of knowing than seeing, generates a theoretical expression of the same idea. Sontag links knowing through hearing to the notion of responsiveness: hearing is more personal than seeing. Developers of effective assessment packages should take this into account. My study also underscored the importance of process for Creative Writing students in the assessment situation.
