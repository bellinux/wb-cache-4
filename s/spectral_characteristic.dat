5000|$|The vocoder {{examines}} {{speech by}} measuring how its spectral characteristics change over time. This {{results in a}} series of signals representing these modified frequencies at any particular time as the user speaks. In simple terms, the signal is split into a number of frequency bands (the larger this number, the more accurate the analysis) and the level of signal present at each frequency band gives the instantaneous representation of the spectral energy content.Thus, the vocoder dramatically reduces the amount of information needed to store speech, from a complete recording to a series of numbers. To recreate speech, the vocoder simply reverses the process, processing a broadband noise source by passing it through a stage that filters the frequency content based on the originally recorded series of numbers.Information about the instantaneous frequency of the original voice signal (as distinct from its <b>spectral</b> <b>characteristic)</b> is discarded; it was not important to preserve this {{for the purposes of the}} vocoder's original use as an encryption aid. It is this [...] "dehumanizing" [...] aspect of the vocoding process that has made it useful in creating special voice effects in popular music and audio entertainment.|$|E
