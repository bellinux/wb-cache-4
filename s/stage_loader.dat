5000|$|The {{length of}} the second <b>stage</b> <b>loader</b> is such that the final byte overwrites {{location}} 7. After the instruction in location 6 executes, location 7 starts the second <b>stage</b> <b>loader</b> executing. The second <b>stage</b> <b>loader</b> then waits for the much longer tape containing the operating system {{to be placed in}} the tape reader. The difference between the boot loader and second <b>stage</b> <b>loader</b> is the addition of checking code to trap paper tape read errors, a frequent occurrence with relatively low-cost, [...] "part-time-duty" [...] hardware, such as the Teletype Model 33 ASR. (Friden Flexowriters were far more reliable, but also comparatively costly.) ...|$|E
50|$|The AFC {{is placed}} in front of the powered roof supports, and the {{shearing}} action of the rotating drums cutting into the coal seam disintegrates the coal, this being loaded onto the AFC. The coal is removed from the coal face by a scraper chain conveyor to the main gate. Here it is loaded onto a network of conveyor belts for transport to the surface. At the main gate the coal is usually reduced in size in a crusher, and loaded onto the first conveyor belt by the beam <b>stage</b> <b>loader</b> (BSL).|$|E
5000|$|GRUB 2 {{differs from}} GRUB 1 by having two (optionally three) stages and being capable of {{automatic}} detection of various operating systems and automatic configuration. The first-stage loader (stage1) is loaded and executed {{either by the}} BIOS from the Master boot record (MBR) or by another boot loader from the partition boot sector. Its job is to discover and access various file systems that the configuration can be read from later. The optional, intermediate <b>stage</b> <b>loader</b> (stage1.5) is loaded and executed by the first-stage loader in case the second-stage loader is not contiguous or if the file-system or hardware requires special handling in order to access the second-stage loader. The second-stage loader (stage2) is loaded last and displays the GRUB startup menu that allows the user to choose an operating system or examine and edit startup parameters. After a menu entry is chosen and optional parameters are given, GRUB loads the kernel into memory and passes control to it. GRUB 2 is also capable of chain-loading of another boot loader.|$|E
50|$|During this initialization, writable memory {{may not be}} available, so all {{computations}} have to {{be performed}} within the processor registers. For this reason, first <b>stage</b> boot <b>loaders</b> tend to be written in assembler language and only do the minimum to provide a normal execution environment for the next program. Some processors either embed a small amount of SRAM in the chip itself, or allow using the onboard cache memory as RAM, to make this first <b>stage</b> boot <b>loader</b> easier to write using high-level language.|$|R
50|$|Typically, {{the first}} <b>stage</b> boot <b>loader</b> is an XIP {{program that is}} linked to run at the address at which the flash chip(s) are mapped at {{power-up}} and contains a minimal program {{to set up the}} system RAM (which depends on the components used on the individual boards and cannot be generalized enough so that the proper sequence could be embedded into the processor hardware) and then loads the second stage bootloader or the OS kernel into RAM.|$|R
50|$|A BIOS boot {{partition}} {{is needed}} because GPT uses the disk sectors {{immediately following the}} Master Boot Record (MBR) to hold the actual partition table, whereas the traditional MBR-based partitioning scheme does not designate them for any special purpose. As a result, {{there is not enough}} unused space available for storing second <b>stages</b> of boot <b>loaders</b> on GPT disks; boot loaders are usually implemented so their code stored within the MBR, which cannot hold more than 512 bytes, operates as a first stage that serves primarily to load a more sophisticated second stage, which is, for example, capable of reading and loading an operating system kernel from a file system.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to design an {{electric}} control system of <b>stage</b> <b>loader</b> which has clear logical relations and is easy to operate. The control system improves the working reliability of electric control system. Taking <b>stage</b> <b>loader</b> used in coal storage yard as an example, we introduce the mechanical structure and working principle of <b>stage</b> <b>loader,</b> mainly discussing about the components of electric control system, the action sequence of the actuator and electrical control PLC program. This paper pointes out that the use of step ladder instruction can make logical relations of action sequence clear and the use of state initialization instruction can make the state transitions among manual program, homing procedure and automatic continuous working procedure simple...|$|E
30|$|In {{terms of}} the study on mining {{equipment}} for LTCC operation, {{the improvement of the}} production rate at a fully mechanized coal face mainly depends on the increase of longwall width and shear cutting depth, fast advance and the extension of applicable range. In particular, the application of electromechanical heavy equipment enables the increase of the production rate, including high powered electric traction shearer, large capacity conveyor, electric-hydraulic controlled hydraulic support, non-stop self-moving <b>stage</b> <b>loader</b> and conveyor end, and high voltage power supply for face equipment. Currently the mining equipment manufactured in China for the fully mechanized longwall face and the LTCC face can meet the requirements and demands for high production and high efficiency in the Chinese coal industry.|$|E
40|$|Advances {{in modern}} {{longwall}} (LW) technology {{have resulted in}} high production faces with more powerful chocks and shearers that can advance at faster rates. As longwall chocks (supports) advance, crushed roof coal and/or rock can fall {{from the top of}} the chock canopy into the face ventilation airflow. Dust survey showed that chock movement is a significant source of dust exposure for shearer operators, accounting for about 47 % of total LW face dust make during the cutting cycle. 3 D CFD models have been developed to understand the behaviour of longwall dust particles from various sources including maingate (MG) chocks and stage loader/crusher. Modelling results demonstrated that much of the respirable dust particles generated from MG chock movements and the beam <b>stage</b> <b>loader</b> (BSL) will disperse onto the longwall face ventilation, contributing significantly to dust exposure levels. Dust control systems using ultra fine water-mist technology have demonstrated promising results in encapsulating respirable dust particles. A prototype water-mist based venturi system has been developed to firstly produce ultra-fine water droplets (5 - 15 Î¼m) for suppressing the respirable dust particles from the MG chocks/BSL; and secondly induce a water-mist airflow with sufficient momentum to divert dust clouds off the walkway area along the face. The new system will be trialled on MG chocks in medium to high seam longwalls on which dust contamination appears to be more problemati...|$|E
40|$|Enoch, Levi, and Jubilees on Sexuality marks a first <b>stage</b> in William <b>Loader's</b> {{research}} on attitudes toward sexuality in Judaism and Christianity of the Hellenistic Greco-Roman era. Loader first discusses the early Enoch literature {{relevant to the}} theme, focusing {{on the impact of}} an ancient myth on the writings and examining how sexual deeds are not here concerned with sexual wrongdoing. He then examines the weight of such wrongdoing in the priestly instruction of the fragmentary Aramaic Levi Document as a whole. He finally considers Jubilees as a cumulative work, building on both the Enoch tradition and the instruction of Levi, and reveals a range of devices warning against sexual depravity. Loader's aim throughout is to interpret the works from within, examining literary form, context, sequence, and tradition and redaction, reflecting engagement with current research in this area...|$|R
5000|$|Boot loaders {{may face}} {{peculiar}} constraints, especially in size; for instance, on the IBM PC and compatibles, a boot sector should typically work in only 32 KB (later relaxed to 64 KB) of system memory and not use instructions {{not supported by}} the original 8088/8086 processors. The first <b>stage</b> of boot <b>loaders</b> (FSBL, first-stage boot loader) located on fixed disks and removable drives must fit into the first 446 bytes of the Master Boot Record in order to leave room for the default 64-byte partition table with four partition entries and the two-byte boot signature, which the BIOS requires for a proper boot loader [...] - [...] or even less, when additional features like more than four partition entries (up to 16 with 16 bytes each), a disk signature (6 bytes), a disk timestamp (6 bytes), an Advanced Active Partition (18 bytes) or special multi-boot loaders have to be supported as well in some environments. In floppy and superfloppy Volume Boot Records, up to 59 bytes are occupied for the Extended BIOS Parameter Block on FAT12 and FAT16 volumes since DOS 4.0, whereas the FAT32 EBPB introduced with DOS 7.1 requires even 71 bytes, leaving only 441 bytes for the boot loader when assuming a sector size of 512 bytes. Microsoft boot sectors therefore traditionally imposed certain restrictions on the boot process, for example, the boot file had to be located at a fixed position in the root directory of the file system and stored as consecutive sectors, conditions taken care of by the [...] command and slightly relaxed in later versions of DOS. The boot loader was then able to load the first three sectors of the file into memory, which happened to contain another embedded boot loader able to load the remainder of the file into memory. When they added LBA and FAT32 support, they even switched to a two-sector boot loader using 386 instructions. At the same time other vendors managed to squeeze much more functionality into a single boot sector without relaxing the original constraints on the only minimal available memory and processor support. For example, DR-DOS boot sectors are able to locate the boot file in the FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32 file system, and load it into memory as a whole via CHS or LBA, even if the file is not stored in a fixed location and in consecutive sectors.|$|R
30|$|During {{the period}} of the ninth five-year {{national}} economic plan, with the cooperation of Zhangjiakou and Northwestern Coal Mining Equipment Manufactory, using CAD technology, the Taiyuan Branch of China Coal Research Institute developed the first scraper conveyors for LTCC face with retractable end chain adjusting device. They were the SGZ 960 / 750 front scraper conveyor and the SGZ 900 / 750 rear scraper conveyor, and also <b>stage</b> <b>loader</b> and crusher. The equipment developed met the requirements from Yankuang Group for a coal production of 10, 000 â 13, 000 t/d. During {{the period of}} the tenth five-year national economic plan, Yankuang Group, the Taiyuan Branch of China Coal Research Institute and Northwestern Benniu Group jointly developed the SGZ 1000 / 1200 and the SGZ 1200 / 1400 long distance high reliability front scraper conveyor and rear scraper conveyor. Currently, the SFZ 1200 / 1400 long distance high reliable rear scraper conveyor is an ultra-heavy scraper conveyor for LTCC faces, which is characterized by its highest power level, widest chute and longest length. Furthermore, it integrated various advanced technologies, including automatic extension of the conveyor end, hydraulic motor chain tensioner, speed adjustment hydraulic coupler and compact chain. In the 1990 s, its main specifications reached an advanced level accepted worldwide. The SGZ 1000 / 1200 front scraper conveyor is currently the largest front scraper conveyor, and can be integrated with various powerful shearers and hydraulic supports. Its installed power is 2 Â ÃÂ  600 Â kW. The development of the SGZ 1000 / 1200 and the SGZ 1200 / 1400 scraper conveyors enables not only the technical advance in scraper conveyor technology, but also in LTCC technology.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the efficiency of desired work inside the long tunnel drilling, rating of electrical drives at tunnel face has significantly increased. Due to the high rating concentration of electrical drives at tunnel face significant voltage must be required which is need of an hour to finish the work in given time interval and to avoid the various dangers. Therefore, planning of electrical power distribution is required and voltage drop across each electrical drives must be taken into account. While power planning drill machine, Armored Face Conveyors (AFC), Shearer, breaker, <b>Stage</b> <b>loader,</b> face lightning, etc. must be given due importance as starting power required to them is very high. Breakaway torque of the AFC is not maintained because of low power, so it is required to start constantly requiring high power as well as it will heat the environment, which is often hazardous. In order to provide the required power drop and reduce the dangers, some alternative methods must be used. In the present investigation voltage drop compensation technique is developed by providing with optimization of position of transformer. Even though the voltage drop cannot be maintained in such cases boosting transformer with the power thyristor with tap changing is used to control the power instead of tap changer mechanism. In order to operate the various drives in long drilling tunnel and finish the work in desired period one must know the various parameters involved in the system. On line parameter such as voltage, currents, temperature, etc. of electrical drives and environment are measured through PC using various sensors, the sensed data is compared with the standard data. The comparison will help to take necessary decision and helps to reduce the forth-coming dangers in the tunnel or electrical drives...|$|E
