40|$|AbstractThough the {{agricultural}} sector contributes significantly to the Indian economy, it faces several bottlenecks, one of those being the antiquated laws governing agricultural marketing and price discovery, leading to low price realization by Indian farmers. In India, six national level exchanges offer commodity derivatives contracts on commodities, with some having electronic <b>spot</b> <b>exchanges</b> to facilitate spot trading of commodities. However, farmers' participation in these exchanges has been poor. ITC-ABD, {{one of the largest}} aggregators and exporters of Indian agri-commodities, has started using these exchange platforms to hedge price risk. With experience of over three decades in {{the agricultural}} sector, Mr. S. Sivakumar has a deep understanding of the commodity markets and the needs of Indian farmers. This interview aims to get an insight into his views on increasing farmers' participation in commodity derivatives trading and more importantly, to understand ITC-ABD's commodity hedging strategy...|$|E

The present study examines {{the effects of the}} 1997 Asian Financial Crisis on the value of the Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) against the US Dollar (USD) over a 186 -month period, including the 12 -month period prior to the formal beginning of the financial crisis; the 18 -month period of the financial crisis; and a 156 -month period following the financial crisis, during which the continuing effects of the value crisis accompanying the financial crisis are observed. The principle objective of the present study is to empirically measure the level of uncertainty concerning the value of the IDR against the USD and the effects of the uncertainty on the Shariah compliance of international commutative transactions during and following the financial crisis, taking the form of either <b>spot</b> <b>exchanges</b> or exchanges involving deferred payments, in relation to the prohibition against gharar. Premised upon purchasing power parity theory, the present study examines the exchange rate based upon the perceived local value of the two currencies, measured as the real exchange rate (RER) based upon inflation data for the two currencies; and the perceived value of the Indonesia Rupiah according to international financial markets, measured by the nominal exchange rate (NER) between the two currencies. The purchasing power parity between the NER and RER is then examined to determine a gharar threshold that determines whether the disparity between the two values constitutes a minor level of uncertainty, which is permissible under Shariah law, or excessive uncertainty, which is forbidden in commutativ...|$|E

40|$|We {{study and}} {{formulate}} arbitrage in display advertising. Real-Time Bidding (RTB) mimics stock <b>spot</b> <b>exchanges</b> and utilises computers to algorithmically buy display ads per impression via a real-time auction. Despite the new au-tomation, the ad markets are still informationally inefficient {{due to the}} heavily fragmented marketplaces. Two display impressions with similar or identical effectiveness (e. g., mea-sured by conversion or click-through rates for a targeted audience) may sell for quite different prices at different mar-ket segments or pricing schemes. In this paper, we pro-pose a novel data mining paradigm called Statistical Ar-bitrage Mining (SAM) focusing on mining and exploiting price discrepancies between two pricing schemes. In essence, our SAMer is a meta-bidder that hedges advertisers ’ risk between CPA (cost per action) -based campaigns and CPM (cost per mille impressions) -based ad inventories; it statis-tically assesses the potential profit and cost for an incom-ing CPM bid request against a portfolio of CPA campaigns based on the estimated conversion rate, bid landscape and other statistics learned from historical data. In SAM, (i) functional optimisation is utilised to seek for optimal bid-ding to maximise the expected arbitrage net profit, and (ii) a portfolio-based risk management solution is leveraged to reallocate bid volume and budget across the set of campaigns to make a risk and return trade-off. We propose to jointly optimise both components in an EM fashion with high effi-ciency to help the meta-bidder successfully catch the tran-sient statistical arbitrage opportunities in RTB. Both the offline experiments on a real-world large-scale dataset and online A/B tests on a commercial platform demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed solution in exploiting arbitrage in various model settings and market environments...|$|E

40|$|This paper revisits one of {{the oldest}} {{questions}} in international finance: does the forward exchange rate contain useful information about of the future path of the <b>spot</b> <b>exchange</b> rate? We present a theoretical framework and provide evidence that challenges the common view (Mussa (1979); Dornbusch (1980); Frenkel (1981); Cumby-Obstfeld (1984) that forward premia contain little information regarding subsequent changes in the <b>spot</b> <b>exchange</b> rate. Using weekly dollar-DM and dollar-sterling data on <b>spot</b> <b>exchange</b> rates and 1, 3, 6., and 12 month forward exchange rates, we find that, as predicted by the theoretical framework the term structure of forward exchange rates together with the <b>spot</b> <b>exchange</b> rate comprise a system that is well represented by a vector vector correction model. Employing Johansen's (1991) maximum likelihood approach, we test and confirm for each country the existence of 4 cointegrating relationships as predicted by the theory. We then test and confirm for each country the joint hypothesis that a basis for this cointegrating space is the vector of 4 forward premia. We next test, and reject for each country, the hypothesis that the <b>spot</b> <b>exchange</b> rate is weekly exogenous with respect to the term structure of forward rates. Out-of-sample simulations indicate that the information contained in the term structure of forward premia can be used to reduce the mean squared error in forecasting the spot rate by at least 33 percent at 6 month horizon and 50 percent at a 1 year horizon...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a vector {{autoregression}} model (VAR) {{is proposed}} {{in order to test}} uncovered interest parity (UIP) in the foreign exchange market. Consider a VAR system of the <b>spot</b> <b>exchange</b> rate (yen/dollar), the domestic (US) interest rate and the foreign (Japanese) interest rate, describing the interdependence of the domestic and international financia lmarkets. Uncovered interest parity is stated as a null hypothesis that the current difference between the two interest rates is equal to the difference between the expected future (log of) exchange rate and the (log of) current <b>spot</b> <b>exchange</b> rate. Note that the VAR system will yield the expected future <b>spot</b> <b>exchange</b> rate as a k-step ahead unconditional prediction. Hence, the null hypothesis is stated as nonlinear cross-equational restrictions for the three-equation VAR system. Then UIP is tested by the Wald test between the unrestricted and restricted systems. A test of UIP with a maintained hypothesis of covered interest parity, becomes a hypothesis test of efficiency without risk premium, that is,the forward exchange rate isthe unbiased predictor of the future <b>spot</b> <b>exchange</b> rate, and information is efficiently used in its prediction. Our results are compared to the efficiency test with a single equation using the Hansen-Hodrick procedure for the same data set. ...|$|R
50|$|For example, {{consider}} that an investor with $5,000,000 USD is {{considering whether to}} invest abroad using an uncovered interest arbitrage strategy or to invest domestically. The dollar deposit interest rate is 3.4% in the United States, while the euro deposit rate is 4.6% in the euro area. The current <b>spot</b> <b>exchange</b> rate is 1.2730 $/€. For simplicity, the example ignores compounding interest. Investing $5,000,000 USD domestically at 3.4% for six months ignoring compounding, {{will result in a}} future value of $5,170,000 USD. However, exchanging $5,000,000 dollars for euros today, investing those euros at 4.6% for six months ignoring compounding, and exchanging the future value of euros for dollars at the future <b>spot</b> <b>exchange</b> rate (which for this example is 1.2820 $/€), will result in $5,266,976 USD, implying that investing abroad using uncovered interest arbitrage is the superior alternative if the future <b>spot</b> <b>exchange</b> rate turns out to be favorable.|$|R
