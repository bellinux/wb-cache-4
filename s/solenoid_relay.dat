5000|$|Simple {{electrical}} sources include {{inductive loads}} such as <b>relays,</b> <b>solenoids,</b> and the brush contacts in electric motors. Typically these send a pulse of voltage and/or current down any electrical connections present, {{as well as}} radiating a pulse of energy. The amplitude is usually small and the signal may be treated as [...] "noise" [...] or [...] "interference". The switching off or [...] "opening" [...] of a circuit causes an abrupt change in the current flowing. This can in turn cause a large pulse in the electric field across the open contacts, causing arcing and damage. It is often necessary to incorporate design features to limit such effects.|$|R
50|$|The main {{difference}} from most other computing devices is that PLCs are intended-for and therefore tolerant-of more severe conditions (such as dust, moisture, heat, cold), while offering extensive input/output (I/O) {{to connect the}} PLC to sensors and actuators. PLC input can include simple digital elements such as limit switches, analog variables from process sensors (such as temperature and pressure), and more complex data such as that from positioning or machine vision systems. PLC output can include elements such as indicator lamps, sirens, electric motors, pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders, magnetic <b>relays,</b> <b>solenoids,</b> or analog outputs. The input/output arrangements may be built into a simple PLC, or the PLC may have external I/O modules attached to a computer network that plugs into the PLC.|$|R
25|$|An early {{development}} of sequential control was relay logic, by which electrical relays engage electrical contacts which either start or interrupt {{power to a}} device. Relays were first used in telegraph networks before being developed for controlling other devices, such as when starting and stopping industrial-sized electric motors or opening and closing <b>solenoid</b> valves. Using <b>relays</b> for control purposes allowed event-driven control, where actions could be triggered out of sequence, in response to external events. These were more flexible in their response than the rigid single-sequence cam timers. More complicated examples involved maintaining safe sequences for devices such as swing bridge controls, where a lock bolt needed to be disengaged before the bridge could be moved, and the lock bolt could not be released until the safety gates had already been closed.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel technique for sensing direction, angle and velocity from rotation of shafts using simple Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) based micro-switches. Due to electro-mechanical coupling of SMA wires reflected in controlled force generation capacity, the SMA based devices can provide better alternatives for traditional <b>relays,</b> <b>solenoid</b> valves and opto-coupler isolators. The control algorithm {{involved in this}} sensing technique, reads the switch status for shaft rotation and sense the angular displacement thereafter. One of the advantages, this new sensor offers is its inherent robustness to vibration in the host platform. Experiments are carried out under vibrating conditions and obtained results are compared with conventional optical incremental encoder. The result shows that SMA based angle encoder works efficiently and gives more accurate results under disturbance while optical encoders are quite sensitive to similar platform vibration. Due to its compactness and lightweight, this concept of SMA wire based angle sensor is envisaged to be suitable for structural health monitoring applications where discrete angle information is needed at low RPM. ...|$|R
5000|$|Ford {{issued a}} nonstandard starter, a {{direct-drive}} [...] "movable pole shoe" [...] design that provided cost reduction rather than electrical or mechanical benefits. This type of starter eliminated the solenoid, {{replacing it with}} a movable pole shoe and a separate starter relay. This starter operates as follows: The driver turns the key, activating the starter switch. A small electric current flows through the <b>solenoid</b> actuated starter <b>relay,</b> closing the contacts and sending large battery current to the starter motor. One of the pole shoes, hinged at the front, linked to the starter drive, and spring-loaded away from its normal operating position, is swung into position by the magnetic field created by electricity flowing through its field coil. This moves the starter drive forward to engage the flywheel ring gear, and simultaneously closes a pair of contacts supplying current {{to the rest of the}} starter motor winding. Once the engine starts and the driver releases the starter switch, a spring retracts the pole shoe, which pulls the starter drive out of engagement with the ring gear.|$|R

In this thesis {{we are going to}} present a touch screen operated liquid dispenser machine. Using a touch screen interface, we can effectively increase operator accuracy, reduce training time and improve overall efficiencies, thus keeping cost down a properly designed touch screen interface can improve overall accuracy. Present liquid dispenser machine available in industries are costly, complex and hard in design and fabrication. Main requirement from this machine is its metering or measuring quality. Accuracy of measuring is very less in various machine. Hence, the basic theme behind this research is to improve these disadvantages of liquid dispenser machine. The liquid dispenser machine presently available is based on practice and past experience of the employer in his working field and also, its efficiency declines at a greater rate after a period of time. By surveying the present machines and comparing their present limitations, new model will be fabricated so that designs data can be obtained to formulate experimental data based model for this process. The design of model will be so simple that it can be adopted easily by small industries. Easy technology will help to reduce metering problem. The present work reports the design and fabrication of liquid dispenser machine which is used in color industry.
