The toxins, also responsible for the strongly bitter or acrid taste, are destroyed by cooking.

40|$|In practice, {{there are}} many dynamic {{covering}} decision information systems, and knowledge reduction of dynamic covering decision information systems is a significant challenge of covering-based rough sets. In this paper, we first study mechanisms of constructing attribute reducts for consistent covering decision information <b>systems</b> <b>when</b> adding objects using related families. We also employ examples to illustrate how to construct attribute reducts of consistent covering decision information <b>systems</b> <b>when</b> adding objects. Then we investigate mechanisms of constructing attribute reducts for consistent covering decision information <b>systems</b> <b>when</b> deleting objects using related families. We also employ examples to illustrate how to construct attribute reducts of consistent covering decision information <b>systems</b> <b>when</b> deleting objects. Finally, the experimental results illustrates that the related family-based methods are effective to perform attribute reduction of dynamic covering decision information <b>systems</b> <b>when</b> object sets are varying with time.

Blood is also diverted from the lungs through the ductus arteriosus. At birth however, air begins to pass through the lungs, and the diversionary duct closes, so that the lungs can begin to respire. The lungs only fully develop in early childhood.|$|E

The present system mostly runs on former commuter rail lines converted for light rail use, and crosses the city centre via on-street tram lines. The network consists of seven lines with 93 stops. A new line to the Trafford Centre is currently under construction and is due to open by 2020.|$|E

5|$|SR 50, the Paradise Parkway, {{was part}} of Proposition 300 in 1985, but {{was removed from the}} system in December 1994, when then Arizona {{governor}} Fife Symington made some funding cuts that included removal of the Paradise Parkway and Estrella Freeway from the system entirely. (The Estrella Freeway was re-added to the <b>system</b> <b>when</b> Proposition 400 was passed ten years later in 2004.) Route 50 will not be re-added to the system, because in February 1996 the ADOT auctioned off all the right-of-way it had purchased for the freeway, which was to be located between Loop 101 and Route 51 in the Central Valley.|$|E

The Route39-b designation was eliminated on March1, 1921, as part of a partial renumbering of New York's legislative route <b>system.</b> <b>When</b> the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the portion of former Route39-b between Suffern and Harriman became part of NY17.

5|$|An {{agreement}} was signed with Amadeus in 2007 to upgrade Biman's ticketing system with an e-ticketing solution {{to comply with}} IATA rules, which set out a deadline of 31 December 2007 for all member airlines to switch over their ticketing systems. E-ticketing has enabled major airlines to provide online check-in facilities, reducing the need to queue up at check-in counters. However, Biman has not made any attempts to improve customer service through the adoption of e-ticketing, {{although it has been}} able to reduce its own costs. In 2005, Biman had briefly stopped using the Amadeus ticketing <b>system</b> <b>when</b> the government suspended the operation of a local Amadeus subsidiary following a court order, after allegations of money laundering. The suspension, however, lasted only a month, and was lifted after the writ was appealed in the High Court.|$|E

5|$|DOS (Disk Operating System) was the {{operating}} system that brought the company its real success. IBM first approached Microsoft about its upcoming IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC) in July 1980. On August 12, 1981, after negotiations with Digital Research failed, IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft to provide {{a version of the}} CP/M operating system, which was set {{to be used in the}} IBM PC. For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called 86-DOS from Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products for less than US$100,000, which IBM renamed to IBM PC DOS. Microsoft did not have an operating <b>system</b> <b>when</b> they closed the deal with IBM and IBM had not done their homework. Due to potential copyright infringement problems with CP/M, IBM marketed both CP/M and PC DOS for US$240 and US$40, respectively, with PC DOS eventually becoming the standard because of its lower price. 35 of the company's 100 employees worked on the IBM project for more than a year. When the IBM PC debuted, Microsoft was the only company that offered operating system, programming language, and application software for the new computer.|$|E

He was sent out on loan to Northern Premier League Premier Division club Harrogate Town in November 2002, and {{scored in the}} 68th minute of his debut, a 3–1 away win over Gateshead on 12 November. He stayed with Harrogate for three months, in that time scoring 5 goals in 10 appearances before returning to Hull. He made his Football League debut for Hull on 8 February 2003, coming on as an 81st-minute substitute for Damien Delaney in a 1–0 defeat at home to Lincoln City. Two days later, he signed a two-year professional contract with Hull. He made one further appearance in the 2002–03 season, as a 69th-minute substitute in a 1–0 away win against Boston United.|$|E

Woodhouse returned to football in November 2006, joining Rushden & Diamonds in the Conference National before moving to Mansfield Town in January 2009. After leaving them, he moved to Harrogate Town. At the end of February 2010, he joined Sheffield in the Northern Premier League.
