5|$|The 808 was {{the first}} drum machine {{with the ability to}} program an entire {{percussion}} track from beginning to end, complete with breaks and rolls. It includes volume knobs for each voice, numerous audio outputs, and a DIN sync port (a precursor to MIDI) to <b>synchronize</b> <b>with</b> other devices through the Digital Control Bus interface, which was considered groundbreaking. The machine has three trigger outputs, which can be used to <b>synchronize</b> <b>with</b> synthesizers and other equipment.|$|E

It includes the Awesomebar, tabbed browsing, Add-on support, password manager, location-aware browsing, {{and the ability to}} <b>synchronize</b> <b>with</b> the user's computer Firefox browser using Firefox Sync.|$|E
25|$|The macOS {{version of}} iTunes can also <b>synchronize</b> <b>with</b> {{a small number}} of {{discontinued}} digital music players, while the Windows version supports only the iPod. The synchronization is limited, however, in that the iPod is the only digital music player compatible with Apple's proprietary FairPlay digital rights management technology, and thus most music purchased through the iTunes Store (before the introduction of iTunes Plus) can only be played on an iPod. The remaining ability to <b>synchronize</b> <b>with</b> a limited number of legacy digital music players is likely a remnant of Apple's history in the music industry: iTunes was released in January 2001, nine months prior to the iPod's unveiling, and slightly more than two years before the introduction of the iTunes Music Store. When iTunes was released, compatibility with other music players was critical. Since iPod has now become the dominant digital music player, Apple no longer considers that compatibility to be a necessity.|$|E

Johnson held his position at that point to <b>synchronize</b> <b>with</b> the arrival of Early's Division.|$|E
25|$|Application updates {{automatically}} install {{from the}} Mac App Store. The iCloud library User interface (UI) was integrated throughout the operating systems, which includes new Open and Save dialog boxes across built-in applications, iWork and third-party applications via an Application programming interface (API). Applications that {{make use of}} this API support a new user interface to view and manage documents in the cloud that are specific to the application being used. Documents can be renamed from the title bar. iWork documents automatically <b>synchronize</b> <b>with</b> iCloud. The full screen ability is on every display.|$|E
25|$|However, {{in order}} for a {{receiver}} to reproduce the transmitted audio without distortion, it must be tuned to exactly the same frequency as the transmitter. Since this is difficult to achieve in practice, SSB transmissions can sound unnatural, and if the error in frequency is great enough, it can cause poor intelligibility. In order to correct this, a small amount of the original carrier signal can be transmitted so that receivers with the necessary circuitry to <b>synchronize</b> <b>with</b> the transmitted carrier can correctly demodulate the audio. This mode of transmission is called reduced-carrier single-sideband.|$|E

25|$|One of his {{greatest}} strategic marvels was his brilliant fission of the Persio-Roman alliance in 636, when Emperor Heraclius and Emperor Yazdegerd III allied against their common enemy Umar. He was lucky in that the Persian Emperor Yazdegerd III couldn't <b>synchronize</b> <b>with</b> Heraclius as planned. Umar fully availed himself of the opportunity and successfully tackled the situation by inducing the Byzantines to act prematurely. This was contrary to the orders of Emperor Heraclius, who presumably wanted a coordinated attack along with the Persians. Umar did this by sending reinforcements to the Roman front in the Battle of Yarmouk, with instructions that they should appear {{in the form of}} small bands, one after the other, giving the impression of a continuous stream of reinforcements that finally lured the Byzantines to an untimely battle. On the other hand, Yazdegerd III of Persia was engaged in negotiations that further gave Umar time to transfer his troops from Syria to Iraq. These troops proved decisive in the Battle of Qadisiyyah. Both the battles thus fought proved decisive and are noted as two of the most decisive battles in history.|$|E
500|$|The {{music for}} Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor was {{composed}} by Garry Schyman and Nathan Grigg, and a soundtrack album was released digitally by WaterTower Music on September 30, 2014.

For La Strada, Fellini used a variation by Arcangelo Corelli {{that he planned to}} use on the sound track. Rota, unhappy with that plan, wrote an original motif (with echoes of the [...] "Larghetto" [...] from Dvořák's Opus 22 Serenade for Strings in E major [...] ) with rhythmic lines matched to Corelli's piece that <b>synchronize</b> <b>with</b> Gelsomina's movements with the trumpet and Il Matto's with the violin.|$|E

500|$|Gameloft {{frequently}} releases updates to the game. The {{main reason}} for adding new updates is to group characters thematically and to <b>synchronize</b> <b>with</b> Marvel Comics. As such, the first update, released in October 2014, started the [...] "Spider-Verse" [...] storyline; this remained the main theme until the fourth update, released in April 2015. The main villains of this storyline, the Inheritors, were faced in the [...] "Great Hunt" [...] event; first Karn and Morlun, then Daemos and Jennix, and ultimately Solus. The seventh update, released in September 2015, added events and environments based on the Spider-Island storyline into the game. The eighth, released in October 2015, continued Spider-Island, and added Renew Your Vows character Annie Parker and costumes from the All-New, All-Different storyline. The game even anticipated the comics when a new Spider-Woman's costume debuted in the second update, released in December 2014, before its March 2015 comics debut.|$|E

Initially, it absorbs a large amount of her blood and only allows her to act for a limited time, however, it is soon able to fully <b>synchronize</b> <b>with</b> Ryuko as she gets over her embarrassment of wearing such a skimpy outfit. Whenever Ryuko destroys a Goku Uniform, Senketsu absorbs its Life Fiber. Mikisugi later reveals that Issei Matoi designed Senketsu for Ryuko so that they can go against the propagators of the Life Fibers. After Ryuko defeats Ragyo, Senketsu sacrifices himself in atmospheric entry to return Ryuko safely to Earth.|$|E
