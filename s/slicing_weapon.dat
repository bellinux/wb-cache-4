50|$|Mojo's multi-legged flying {{platform}} is armed with various particle beam weapons. It {{also has a}} large artificial appendage {{that can be used}} as an arm or a <b>slicing</b> <b>weapon</b> and two smaller arms. He is strong enough to hold a human off of the ground with one arm easily. He has several powers derived from magic, including the projection of magical energy blasts. These magical powers are strengthened by the 'worship of his followers' and hence directly linked to the popularity of his TV programs. He cannot be harmed by the touch of Rogue, no matter how long she is in contact with him. He has bear hugged Rogue with much ease until she was left unconscious.|$|E
5000|$|As late as Poland's Kościuszko Uprising in 1794, {{the pike}} reappeared {{as a child}} of {{necessity}} which became, for a short period, a surprisingly effective weapon on the battlefield. In this case, General Thaddeus Kosciuszko, facing a shortage of firearms and bayonets to arm landless serf partisans recruited straight from the wheat fields, had their sickles and scythes heated and straightened out into something resembling crude [...] "war scythes". These weaponized agricultural accouterments were then used in battle as both <b>slicing</b> <b>weapons,</b> as well as makeshift pikes. The peasant [...] "pikemen" [...] armed with these crude instruments {{played a pivotal role}} in securing a near impossible victory against a far larger and better equipped Russian army at the Battle of Racławice on April 4 of that year.|$|R

Movement and actions are all controlled with the keyboard or a game controller. These actions include shooting, <b>slicing,</b> changing <b>weapons,</b> picking up objects, throwing objects, and more.

It then beat fellow English representative Tornado in the semi-final before facing walking robot DrillZilla in the final.
