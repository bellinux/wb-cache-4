In <b>sealless</b> pumps, the pumped fluid {{is used as}} the cooling and lubricating medium for the pump bearings. If intermittent monitoring is used, then the chance of detecting pump damage caused by process changes is very small. Vibration monitoring techniques as applied to sealed pumps has been unreliable for detecting problems with <b>sealless</b> pumps. The effectiveness of conventional monitoring techniques {{is limited by the}} time interval between measurements, the relative isolation of the inner pump rotor from the outer measuring location, and by the pump fluid. Other factors such as fluid effects and process noises can make interpretation difficult. This paper presents the synergistic combination of two relatively new methods of <b>sealless</b> pump monitoring. These methods considerably enhance the range and magnitude of the mechanical problems that can be identified on this type of pump. One of the goals of predictive maintenance is the reduction of maintenance costs by use of condition monitoring. Identification of off-design operation conditions or mechanical damage at an early stage enables the equipment owner to correct the conditions before damage occurs, or to optimally schedule repairs. Continuous monitoring of <b>sealless</b> pumps, can reduce equipment maintenance costs and facilitate root cause analysis of mechanical failures and operational problems.

These component failures are attributed with the lion?s share of the pump maintenance cost. Moreover, even a functioning seal cannot be classified as a zero emission point within a chemical plant; the cost of these emissions will continue to rise with time. Business competition and societal pressure demand that maintenance costs be reduced and chemical emissions to the environment be eliminated. The progress made by one chemical manufacturing company in their meeting these demands, while also satisfying the additional business objectives of safety, reliability, and profitability is reviewed.

Much is written {{of the importance of}} pump/system interaction in ensuring maximum pump life. Inside of the <b>sealless</b> magnet drive is a complex internal flow system which is difficult to model, but is crucial to the successful operation of this type of machine, due to the need to effectively cool the magnetic drive, lubricate the bearings, and safely transport solids. With low specific heat, volatile liquids, a clear understanding of the internal flow system is essential if dangerous flashing resulting in premature pump failure is to be prevented. The results of tests undertaken on a number of different internal feed systems are presented.

Gas seal separates the fluid end from the power end, thus allowing infinite dry running operation and solids-handling capability to 40 percent particulates. Since the back end is separated, fluid-lubricated journal bearings are not required, and antifriction ball bearings, are used instead providing stiff rotor construction, with (L^ 3) /(D^ 4) ratio as low as 9. 3, which significantly minimizes deflections of the shaft. At the same time, a containment shell ensures leak-free operation and no spills, even in the unlikely event of barrier seal failure. Installation of the gas barrier design improved the mean time between failure for a tough application at a major chemical plant from six days to two years, and the pump continues to operate successfully.

40|$|Lecturepg. 93 Centrifugal pump design {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in the safe operation of any refinery or chemical processing plant. In analyzing the performance of centrifugal pumps, pump operating time to failure is almost always limited to that of the shaft mechanical seal. Mechanical seals and their sophisticated supporting systems have become more complicated as the pumping industry perseveres in its efforts to produce satisfactorily seal life. Numerous research projects have proceeded, many papers demonstrating seal leakage have been presented, but the overall progress in extending seal life has not been to everyone?s satisfaction. A viable and important option, therefore, is a centrifugal pump that does not require mechanical seals. A magnetically driven <b>sealless</b> pump is such a machine. It conveys liquid safely with no dynamic seal between the motor shaft and the impeller(s). There is no potential leakage path, since prime mover energy is transmitted magnetically through the pressure casing wall. Magnet drive pumps are capable of producing flow rates to 5000 gpm and heads to 1000 ft. Temperatures ranging from - 100 ?F to + 850 ?F, and system pressure to 5000 psi can be accommodated without the need for any ancillary services or supporting systems. Likewise, the magnet drive pump is excellent for high vacuum services where sealing mechanically may prove extremely difficult. <b>Sealless</b> pumps generally are thought to be intolerant of solids in pumpage. However, magnet drive pump designs are now available with substantially improved performance in abrasive services. The magnet drive centrifugal pump is simply a conventional centrifugal pump with an integral magnetic coupling imposed between the driver and the liquid end. This magnetic coupling replaces the seal chamber or stuffing box {{in such a way that}} the liquid end is made hermetic. The mechanical seal or packing is eliminated and the only seal is a stationary gasket or O-ring. The mechanical design features are outlined for the <b>sealless</b> magnet drive centrifugal pump along with the advantages and occasional limitations of this type of machine com-pared with mechanically sealed pumps.

40|$|Lecturepg. 1 For {{applications}} that involved fluids {{with a high}} rate of change of vapor pressure or low specific heat, it was found that there could be inadequate flow through the thrust bearing. This effect was compounded by the heat generation due to the eddy currents that occur in magnetic drive pumps with metallic shells. This paper describes a computer simulation to predict the flows, pressures, and temperatures in magnetic drive <b>sealless</b> pumps. The program has been developed using both theoretical and test work. The objective of the program was to provide reliable selection of magnetic drive pumps; this was accomplished by taking into account the effects of viscosity, vapor pressure, and other liquid properties on the local pressures in the pump. The goal of this program was thus to simulate a customer?s desired application of a particular fluid at an operating pressure, temperature, NPSH, and speed. The resulting conclusion would be whether the customer?s fluid and operating conditions were applicable for <b>sealless</b> pumps. Warnings are output through the graphical user interface of the program at the various points, should flashing occur using the particular fluid. The testing involved a wide range of pump sizes. Within each size, an extensive matrix involved running at different speeds, different cut impeller diameters, and from shutoff through runout condition. The units were tested with different shell configurations and different materials. These included polyetheretherketone (known as PEEK), Alloy C- 276, and a dual containment consisting of both materials. The design of the back shroud influences the magnitude of the hub factor. This is because the traditional affinity laws cannot be applied to the calculation of the axial load for semiopen impeller with a scalloped back shroud, pump out vanes, or pump out slots. One of the important findings was that the impeller hub factor, which is required for the computation of the axial load, changed as a function of speed and cut impeller diameter. It was also found that pump out vanes or pump out slots significantly enhanced the lubrication through the bearings and across magnets. Part of the verification involved performing tests with different bushing clearances and grooving configurations. These were analyzed empirically to confirm the coefficients that were obtained from experimental methods. In order to examine the possible operation of the pump when handling the user?s particular fluid, the flow is simulated in the program using a graphical user interface. A graphical output is given of all the pertinent locations in the systems, such as the thrust collar face or the gap between the driven magnets and the shell. The program currently calculates the pressure, flow, and temperature within the flowpath, along with the axial thrust, at five pump operating flow conditions expressed {{as a percentage of the}} best efficiency point...|$|E

However, as with any piece of process machinery, magnetic drive pumps are designed to operate within specific parameters and operation outside of these parameters can lead to reduced levels of reliability.

By constantly monitoring the condition of the pumped liquid present in the internal flow regime of a magnetic-drive pump, it is possible to rapidly identify potential issues and react to them accordingly. Ultrasonic technology has been utilised to rapidly and accurately detect the presence of vapour in the liquid stream.

Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) was discovered to be an excellent method for fabricating dense electrolyte layers of about 5 m thick on porous non-conducting substrates. The EPD process was thoroughly studied from proof-of-concept to statistical reproducibility, deposition mechanism, modeling and process optimization. Deposition on non-conducting substrates was found to follow many of the same fundamental trends as that on conductive substrates except for the voltage efficiency and detailed charge transfer mechanism. Eventually, the process was optimized such that an SOFC was fabricated that achieved 1. 1 W/cm 2 at 850 C. Further, a novel <b>sealless</b> planar SOFC was designed that incorporates a hermetic interface between the electrolyte and interconnect similar to tubular and honeycomb designs. The hermetic interface successfully acted as a blocking electrode under DC polarization, indicating its potential to act as a sealant. Leakage rates across the interface were 0. 027 sccm at 750 c, similar to polycrystalline mica seals. Through a process of tape casting and lamination, a two-cell stack without sealant was fabricated and achieved a power density of 75 mW/cm 2 at 750 C. Finally, the degradation rate of silver and silver-based interconnects was studied under static and dual-atmosphere conditions. Corrosion of silver grain boundaries along with sublimation losses results in the formation of large pores, resulting in up to 30 of anode oxidation after 8 hrs testing at 750 c.

Silicon carbide bearings are known to be the least forgiving during dry running, but are still the best universal choice. The {{purpose of this study is}} to demonstrate means to extend the life of silicon carbide bearings in a dry running environment. A test rig was designed to simulate broken prime and drained pump dry run conditions. The test pump was a 1 ? x 1 x 8 ANSI magnetic drive pump driven by a 15 hp 3600 rpm motor. Both sintered silicon carbide and 70 micron controlled porosity silicon carbide with Teflon lubricating strips were tested in conductive and nonconductive containment shells. Damage assessment was made after each test. Results of water tests show the robust pump design and proper bearing alignment is essential. Under broken prime conditions with a nonconductive containment shell, controlled porosity silicon carbide with Teflon lubricating strips ran for 4 ? hours without overheating, failure or damage. The broken prime dry run time for conductive containment shells is partly dependent upon the magnitude of eddy current heat generated and the time required to boil off the product lubricant; for the models tested, this time was approximately 32 to 35 minutes. Drained casing tests with nonconductive containment shells show a doubling of dry run time with controlled porosity silicon carbide and Teflon strips over that of sintered silicon carbide. A drained casing test with conductive containment shell configured with controlled porosity silicon carbide and Teflon lubricating strips had a dry run time of 36 minutes and underwent much less bearing damage than a broken prime test with sintered silicon carbide and conductive containment shell. The addition of controlled porosity silicon carbide and Teflon lubricating strips can add substantially to dry run life and help reduce damage to the product lubricated bearings...|$|E
40|$|Tutorialpg. 129 Exxon Chemical {{like many}} other {{petrochemical}} companies and refineries, is announcing emission plans with a long term goal to achieve continuous emission reduction from the plant sites. Exxon Chemical?s emission plan has reduced air emission by 90 percent since 1975, with work continuing to further reduce emissions {{over the next five}} years. These foals are being driven by company policy with concern for the environment, business competition, government regulations, and public concern {{over the past several years}}. Since many petrochemical and refinery employees, friends, and relatives live in areas where plants are located, they are just as concerned about safety and hygiene impact of emissions and waste disposal from the plants as the general public, environmental activist groups, and government agencies. Due to the steadily increasing public concern over the environment, the government regulations are becoming more restrictive in leakage criteria. A good example of this is the current regulatory debate to the Clean Air Act, which would require industry to utilize maximum achievable control technology. To reduce emissions, great improvements have been made over the past several years in pump mechanical seal design, evaluation, and auxiliary support systems. However, the mechanical seal design inherently requires a minute leakage across the faces for lubrication, along with costly auxiliary systems and environmental monitoring programs. Even with the improvements, mechanical seals remain the most fragile and weakest link of the pump; thus, they are the primary cause of pump failures [1] that can also contribute to emissions. Mechanical seals typically fail as a result as a result of many factors, such as process upsets, vibration problems, bearing failures, auxiliary support system failures, and problems caused from maintenance and operating personnel. Consequently, one solution to reducing pump failures due to mechanical seals and resulting emissions is to apply <b>sealless</b> pumps to more hazardous, toxic, or hydrocarbon services. For this reason, an engineering survey was launched to evaluate magnetic drive and canned motor pumps. ...|$|E
