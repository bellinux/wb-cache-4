5|$|P.atriplicifolia is {{frequently}} propagated by cuttings. Because its woody crown is resistant to division, <b>softwood</b> <b>cuttings</b> {{are taken from}} shoots near the base, generally in late spring. Hardwood cuttings selected in mid-to-late summer also provide a viable propagation technique. The plant is also grown from seed in cultivation. Such seeds require exposure to cold for 30–160 days to germinate, and seed-raised specimens may not preserve the characteristics of named cultivars. In the commercial greenhouse or nursery setting, P.atriplicifolia relatively large size and rapid growth can adversely affect quality or make plants more difficult and expensive to transport; the use of plant growth regulators such as chlormequat chloride and daminozide may be more cost-effective than large-scale pruning.|$|E
2500|$|Elm {{propagation}} methods {{vary according}} to elm type and location, and the plantsman's needs. Native species may be propagated by seed. In their natural setting native species, such as wych elm and European White Elm in central and northern Europe and Field Elm in southern Europe, set viable seed in ‘favourable' seasons. Optimal conditions occur after a late warm spring. After pollination, seeds of spring-flowering elms ripen and fall {{at the start of}} summer (June); they remain viable for only a few days. They are planted in sandy potting-soil at a depth of one centimetre, and germinate in three weeks. Slow-germinating American Elm will remain dormant until the second season. Seeds from autumn-flowering elms ripen in the Fall and germinate in the spring. Since elms may hybridize within and between species, seed-propagation entails a hybridisation risk. In unfavourable seasons elm seeds are usually sterile. Elms outside their natural range, such as Ulmus procera in England, and elms unable to pollinate because pollen-sources are genetically identical, are sterile and are propagated by vegetative reproduction. Vegetative reproduction is also used to produce genetically identical elms (clones). Methods include the winter transplanting of root-suckers; taking hardwood cuttings from vigorous one-year-old shoots in late winter, taking root-cuttings in early spring; taking <b>softwood</b> <b>cuttings</b> in early summer; grafting; ground and air layering; and micropropagation. A bottom heat of 18 degrees and humid conditions are maintained for hard- and <b>softwood</b> <b>cuttings.</b> The transplanting of root-suckers remains the easiest and commonest propagation-method for European Field Elm and its hybrids. For 'specimen' urban elms, grafting to wych-elm root-stock may be used to eliminate suckering or to ensure stronger root-growth. The mutant-elm cultivars are usually grafted, the ‘weeping' elms 'Camperdown' and 'Horizontalis' at , the dwarf cultivars 'Nana' and 'Jacqueline Hillier' at ground level. Since the Siberian Elm is drought-tolerant, in dry countries new varieties of elm are often root-grafted on this species.|$|E

This {{study was conducted in}} Agropark, University Malaysia Kelantan. By using the completely randomized block design, cuttings were taken in areas around University Malaysia Kelantan and planted in the medium containing soil (60 %), compost (20 %) and sand (20 %) after dipping in indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) for five minutes. Five different parameters were studied for number of leaves; branches and branch length were measured per week while number of root and root length were measured for four weeks interval. It was obvious that the root initiation of Chromolaena odorata is significantly (P < 0. 05) influenced by the interactive effect of cutting age and IBA concentration. Maximum number of leaves (19. 13), branches (4. 00), branch length (7. 43), number of root (45. 11), and root length (12. 87) was obtained in cuttings treated with 2000 ppm while minimum number of leaves (12. 6), branches (2. 47), branch length (5. 93), number of root (24. 33), and root length (6. 60), was recorded in control treatment. Meanwhile, the <b>cuttings</b> taken from <b>softwood</b> had higher number of leaves (19. 30), branches (3. 70), branch length (7. 25), number of root (45. 25), and root length (12. 40) than those taken from semi-hardwood and hardwood. <b>Softwood</b> <b>cutting</b> responded more positively to IBA and stimulated leaf and root formation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of a range of Indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) concentrations (250, 500 and 750 mg l- 1) alone and in combination with three strains of Agrobacterium rubi (A 1, A 16 and A 18) on the rooting capacity of wild sour cherry (Prunus cerasus L.) <b>softwood</b> and semi-hardwood <b>cuttings.</b> The bacterial strains {{used in the present study}} were isolated from the foliage of pome fruits (from apple and pear orchards) growing in the eastern Anatolia region of Turkey. No rooting was observed on the cuttings of wild sour cherry with control treatment (no IBA or bacterial treatment) in both types of cuttings, whereas different rooting percentages were observed on the cuttings treated with IBA and bacteria. The highest rooting percentages were 65 % for softwood and 70 % for semi-hardwood cuttings when they were treated with 250 mg l- 1 IBA + A 16 treatments. In <b>softwood</b> <b>cutting</b> treatments, the bacteria strains A 16 (43. 8 %) and A 1 (42. 5 %) were found to be more effective than the strain A 18 (18. 8 %) and the control (13. 1 %). Among the hormone doses, the best rooting percentage was found at the treatment of 250 mg l- 1 IBA (39. 4 %). In semi-hardwood cuttings the highest rooting percentage among the bacterial strains and hormone doses was obtained with the treatments of A 16 (49. 4 %) and 750 mg l- 1 IBA (46. 9 %). The results indicate that the combination of IBA + bacteria is highly effective in increasing rooting capacity when compared to the control, or bacteria and IBA treatments alone...|$|R

40|$|Concetta’ is a fluorescent, orange-colored rose {{suitable}} for pot forcing, landscape planting, and fresh or dried commercial cut flowers (Fig. 1). It produces few thorns {{and can be}} propagated from three-eye <b>softwood</b> stem <b>cuttings</b> or through tissue culture. Origin ‘Concetta’ (Papconc; originator or breeder, {{can be used for}} a trademark) arose as a sport (chimera) on the floribunda rose ‘Gabriella’ (Berggren), which was a mutation of ‘Mercedes’ (R. Kordes) (Krussmann, 1981). ‘Mercedes’ is a floribunda rose from a cross of an unnamed seedling with ‘Anabell’ (Kordes) (Krussmann, 1981). Culture Initial propagation was from three-eye <b>softwood</b> stem <b>cuttings,</b> which rooted readily under intermittent mist. The bottom part of the stem was dipped in 0. 3 % 1 -indole- 3 -butyric acid hormone powder. Over the last 8 years, repeated stem cuttings from the original sport and daughter plants have displayed stable characteristics. Tissue culture of axillary buds was also successful, in the four years of university research and in a commercial laboratory. Tissue culture protocol followed was that of Skirvin and Chu (1981). During tissue culture, a low mutation rate (1 % to 10 %), specifically albino flower color, was noted. All plants were planted in 18 -liter containers in a 2 soil : 1 peat : 1 perlite mix and grown in a glass greenhouse. Each week, the plants received 20 N- 13 P- 8 K fertilizer at 300 ppm N. Plants were allowed to flower continuously. New flowers formed every 5 to 8 weeks, depending on the season. Plants were cut back once a year in December. Description ‘Concetta’ is a dense, shrubby rose with an upright growth habit. Overall height at maturity is » 1 m. The general flower color is an unusual glowing orange that may appear similar to that of ‘Mercedes’. ‘Concetta’s color, however, is different and is classified as orange- orange, PMS 172 (Pantone, 1985), rather than the orange-red typical of ‘Mercedes’. Additionally, ‘Concetta’ is more floriferous, with most flowers borne singly. It is classified as a hybrid tea due to its flower shape and petalage, grows well on its own roots in the greenhouse or outside, has few thorns or prickles, and produces a superior warm-red dried flower. The flower buds are small, initially umshaped, becoming high centered as the petals curl outward. The petals are thick, ruffled, and, on maturity, reflexed with a velvety inside and smooth outside. Petal number is usually » 32 (mean of 19 flowers) with a range of 26 to 35 per bud. The flowers measure 5. 0 to 6. 3 cm across and have a slightly fruity fragrance. The foliage is medium sized and compound (five to seven leaflets). It is leathery and semi- to glossy green. Each leaflet is oval, acuminate, and finely biserrate...|$|R
