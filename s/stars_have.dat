5|$|Binary and multi-star systems {{consist of}} two or more stars that are gravitationally bound and {{generally}} move around each other in stable orbits. When two such <b>stars</b> <b>have</b> a relatively close orbit, their gravitational interaction can {{have a significant impact on}} their evolution. Stars can form part of a much larger gravitationally bound structure, such as a star cluster or a galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{relatively}} vast distances between stars outside the galactic nucleus, collisions between stars {{are thought to be}} rare. In denser regions such as the core of globular clusters or the galactic center, collisions can be more common. Such collisions can produce what are known as blue stragglers. These abnormal <b>stars</b> <b>have</b> a higher surface temperature than the other main sequence stars with the same luminosity of the cluster to which it belongs.|$|E
5|$|Hot Jupiters, due {{to their}} extreme proximities to their host <b>stars,</b> <b>have</b> {{been shown to be}} losing their atmospheres into space due to stellar radiation, much like the tails of comets. These planets may have vast {{differences}} in temperature between their day and night sides that produce supersonic winds, although the day and night sides of HD 189733 b appear to have very similar temperatures, indicating that that planet's atmosphere effectively redistributes the star's energy around the planet.|$|E
50|$|An NYPD {{spokesperson}} initially {{reported that}} <b>Star</b> <b>had</b> died. However, the next day, {{a spokesperson for}} the New York City Animal Care and Control facility reported that <b>Star</b> <b>had</b> survived the shooting, but that according to the NYPD, her chances of survival were poor.|$|R
5000|$|HD 4203 is a 9th {{magnitude}} star located approximately 250 {{light years}} away in the constellation Pisces. The star is yellow with spectral type G5. The <b>star</b> <b>has</b> evolved for 9.41 billion years. The <b>star</b> <b>has</b> a gas giant planet orbiting around a high metallicity star.|$|R

5|$|Near Epsilon and Gamma Coronae Australis is Bernes 157, a dark nebula {{and star}} forming region. It {{is a large}} nebula, 55 by 18 arcminutes, that {{possesses}} several stars around magnitude 13. These <b>stars</b> <b>have</b> been dimmed by up to 8 magnitudes by its dust clouds.|$|E
5|$|Of the 168 {{stars on}} the walk of fame, 154 are for individuals, {{including}} athletes; coaches; actors, directors, writers and producers of movies, television and stage; singers, songwriters and musicians; playwrights; authors; comedians; cartoonists; and supermodels. Fourteen <b>stars</b> <b>have</b> been given to groups, such as music bands, comedy troupes, sports teams. In these cases, the group name is listed on the star {{and the names of}} individual members are omitted.|$|E
5|$|Spiral galaxies, {{like the}} Milky Way, produce new generations of stars {{as long as}} they have dense {{molecular}} clouds of interstellar hydrogen in their spiral arms. Elliptical galaxies are largely devoid of this gas, and so form few new stars. The supply of star-forming material is finite; once <b>stars</b> <b>have</b> converted the available supply of hydrogen into heavier elements, new star formation will come to an end.|$|E

5|$|Studies of discs {{around other}} <b>stars</b> <b>have</b> also {{done much to}} {{establish}} a time frame for Solar System formation. Stars between one and three million years old have discs rich in gas, whereas discs around stars more than 10million years old have little to no gas, suggesting that giant planets within them have ceased forming.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of the radius and the mass of a star determines its surface gravity. Giant <b>stars</b> <b>have</b> a much lower surface gravity than do main sequence stars, while the opposite {{is the case for}} degenerate, compact stars such as white dwarfs. The surface gravity can influence the appearance of a star's spectrum, with higher gravity causing a broadening of the absorption lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of planetesimals {{is the biggest}} unsolved problem in the nebular disk model. How 1cm sized particles coalesce into 1km planetesimals is a mystery. This mechanism {{appears to be the}} key to the question as to why some <b>stars</b> <b>have</b> planets, while others have nothing around them, not even dust belts.|$|E

50|$|This <b>star</b> <b>has</b> 1.55 {{times the}} mass of the Sun.|$|R
5|$|The {{more massive}} the star, the shorter its lifespan, {{primarily}} because massive <b>stars</b> <b>have</b> greater pressure on their cores, {{causing them to}} burn hydrogen more rapidly. The most massive stars last an average of a few million years, while stars of minimum mass (red dwarfs) burn their fuel very slowly and can last tens to {{hundreds of billions of}} years.|$|E
5|$|White dwarf <b>stars</b> <b>have</b> {{their own}} class {{that begins with}} the letter D. This is further sub-divided into the classes DA, DB, DC, DO, DZ, and DQ, {{depending}} on the types of prominent lines found in the spectrum. This {{is followed by a}} numerical value that indicates the temperature.|$|E
5|$|All main-sequence <b>stars</b> <b>have</b> a {{core region}} where energy is {{generated}} by nuclear fusion. The temperature and density of this core are at the levels necessary to sustain the energy production that will support {{the remainder of the}} star. A reduction of energy production would cause the overlaying mass to compress the core, resulting in an increase in the fusion rate because of higher temperature and pressure. Likewise an increase in energy production would cause the star to expand, lowering the pressure at the core. Thus the star forms a self-regulating system in hydrostatic equilibrium that is stable over the course of its main sequence lifetime.|$|E

5|$|Degenerate <b>stars</b> <b>have</b> {{contracted}} into {{a compact}} mass, {{resulting in a}} rapid rate of rotation. However they have relatively low rates of rotation compared to what would be expected by conservation of angular momentumâ€”the tendency of a rotating body to compensate for a contraction in size by increasing its rate of spin. A {{large portion of the}} star's angular momentum is dissipated as a result of mass loss through the stellar wind. In spite of this, the rate of rotation for a pulsar can be very rapid. The pulsar {{at the heart of the}} Crab nebula, for example, rotates 30 times per second. The rotation rate of the pulsar will gradually slow due to the emission of radiation.|$|E
5|$|Historically, <b>stars</b> <b>have</b> been {{important}} to civilizations throughout the world. They {{have been part of}} religious practices and used for celestial navigation and orientation. Many ancient astronomers believed that stars were permanently affixed to a heavenly sphere and that they were immutable. By convention, astronomers grouped stars into constellations and used them to track the motions of the planets and the inferred position of the Sun. The motion of the Sun against the background stars (and the horizon) was used to create calendars, which could be used to regulate agricultural practices. The Gregorian calendar, currently used nearly everywhere in the world, is a solar calendar based on the angle of the Earth's rotational axis relative to its local star, the Sun.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{the results}} of a search for giant planets in the {{globular}} cluster 47 Tucanae were announced. The lack of any successful discoveries suggests that the abundance of elements (other than hydrogen or helium) necessary to build these planets may need to be at least 40% of the abundance in the Sun. Terrestrial planets are built from heavier elements such as silicon, iron and magnesium. The very low abundance of these elements in globular clusters means that the member <b>stars</b> <b>have</b> a far lower likelihood of hosting Earth-mass planets, when compared to stars in the neighborhood of the Sun. Hence the halo region of the Milky Way galaxy, including globular cluster members, are unlikely to host habitable terrestrial planets.|$|E
50|$|At present Blue <b>Stars</b> <b>has</b> no more {{teams at}} the highest level. In 2007, they had only 27 members and stood Blue Stars for {{choosing}} {{whether or not to}} proceed with the association. Blue <b>Stars</b> <b>has</b> then taken by a number of enthusiasts, the decision to go ahead and blow new life into the club. From that moment on Blue Stars started again with a youth section. Blue Stars Men 1 and 2 are in the Rayon. Other teams from the region classes of Amsterdam region. Blue <b>Stars</b> <b>has</b> in the 2013-2014 season more than 130 members.|$|R
50|$|Epsilon Cygni {{is a giant}} {{star with}} a stellar {{classification}} of K0 III. This indicates that the <b>star</b> <b>has</b> left the main sequence and has begun the final stages in its stellar evolution. Since 1943, the spectrum of this <b>star</b> <b>has</b> served {{as one of the}} stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. The effective temperature of the star's photosphere is 4,710 K, giving Epsilon Cygni an orange hue that is a characteristic of K-type <b>stars.</b> This <b>star</b> <b>has</b> nearly 11 times the solar radius and is about 62 times the luminosity of the Sun.|$|R
