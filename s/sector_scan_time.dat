40|$|One of the {{drawbacks}} of airborne interferometric {{synthetic aperture radar}} is a relatively narrow swath compared to analogous space based systems. Increasing the swath with side view of the interferometer can be possible by increasing the flight altitude and angle of sight. At {{the same time the}} height measurement accuracy decreases due to slant range distance increase. Another possible way of swath increasing is using <b>sector</b> <b>scan.</b> The efficiency of <b>sector</b> <b>scan</b> using in interferometric synthetic aperture radar is analyzed in this paper. The mathematical model and geometry of height measurement at a <b>sector</b> <b>scan</b> have been discussed. There was made an analysis of the effect of terrain height and observation angle on received signal phase changing. Observation angle changing is shown to contribute to the phase changing. Potential height accuracy measurement was calculated. The calculation results show that increasing the observation angle reduces height accuracy measurement. The maximum accuracy decrease is obtained at the observation angle of 90 °. Despite height accuracy measurement decrease applying the <b>sector</b> <b>scan</b> allow to expand the swath. The accuracy decrease can be limited by selecting optimal parameters of scanning...|$|R

Directional antennas can be exploited in 60 GHz networks to mitigate the detrimental impact of fading. Employing fully directional antennas complicates the neighbor discovery process where each sector must be probed individually to discover neighbors located in that <b>sector.</b> In random <b>scanning</b> strategy, nodes select to-be-scanned sector randomly. In this letter, we analyze the minimum number of random <b>sector</b> <b>scanning</b> attempts during neighbor discovery process to have a non-isolated network. We present an analytical model to study the isolation probability defined as probability of having at least one isolated node in the network. Based on the isolation probability, we derive the minimum number of <b>sector</b> <b>scanning</b> attempts in a 60 GHz ad hoc network with arbitrary number of nodes. Although 60 GHz directional network is studied, this analysis is applicable to any directional wireless network.

40|$|In the {{conventional}} single-echo three dimension (3 D) time-of-flight (TOF) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), it always takes long <b>scan</b> <b>time</b> {{to obtain the}} good images. In addition, high-resolution MRA with flow compensation requires long echo time (TE). Here, a reverse elliptical centric dual-echo 3 D TOF MRA pulse sequence was developed to reduce the <b>scan</b> <b>time</b> and minimize the effective TE. Dual-echo and reverse elliptical centric acquisition in the phase encoding and slice phase encoding direction were used to reduce the <b>scan</b> <b>time</b> by 61 %. Furthermore, the effective echo time (TE) was also minimized from 4. 8 ms to 4. 1 ms.

The {{results show that the}} CNR only decrease by 2. 5 % with the <b>scan</b> <b>time</b> reduced to 39 % when compared with {{the conventional}} single-echo 3 D TOF. Compared with the conventional dual-echo 3 D TOF acquisition, the developed pulse sequence brings advantages in three aspects: (1) reduce <b>scan</b> <b>time</b> by 22 %; (2) increase CNR by 10 %; (3) reduce the artifacts induced by dual-echo effects.

Each session was considered complete when reproducible waveforms were obtained for 5 s in three predefined regions of the kidney. The <b>scan</b> <b>times</b> needed to obtain waveforms of the right and left kidneys were recorded separately. Measurements were compared using a paired t-test and a two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The total recorded Doppler sonography <b>scan</b> <b>time</b> for each kidney ranged from 33 to 146 s.

The reason for this is the required <b>scanning</b> <b>time</b> of several seconds during which even slight head movements can lead to kinetic blurring and landmark displacement.
