2500|$|CRISPR-Cas systems {{fall into}} two classes. [...] Class 1 systems use a complex of {{multiple}} Cas proteins to degrade foreign nucleic acids. [...] Class 2 systems use a single large Cas protein for the same purpose. [...] Class 1 is divided into types I, III, and IV; class 2 is divided into types II, V, and VI. [...] The 6 system types are divided into 19 subtypes. [...] Each type and most subtypes are characterized by a [...] "signature gene" [...] found almost exclusively in the category. [...] Classification is also based on the complement of cas genes that are present. Most CRISPR-Cas systems have a Cas1 protein. [...] The phylogeny of Cas1 proteins generally agrees with the classification system. [...] Many organisms contain multiple CRISPR-Cas systems suggesting that they are compatible and may <b>share</b> <b>components.</b> The sporadic distribution of the CRISPR/Cas subtypes suggests that the CRISPR/Cas system is subject to horizontal gene transfer during microbial evolution.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new {{extension of the}} DEVS formalism that allows multiple occurrences of a given instance of a DEVS component. This paper is a follow-up to a previous short paper in which the issue of supporting a new construction called a <b>shared</b> <b>component</b> was raised, {{in the case of}} a DEVS model. In this paper, we first demonstrate, formally, that the multi-occurrence extended definition, that includes the case of <b>shared</b> <b>components,</b> is valid because any model that is built using this extended definition accepts an equivalent model built using standard DEVS. Then we recall the benefits of <b>sharing</b> <b>components</b> for modeling, and further extend this analysis to the simulation area, by investigating how <b>shared</b> <b>components</b> can help to design better simulation engines. Finally, we describe an existing implementation of a simulation software that fully supports this <b>shared</b> <b>component</b> feature, both at the modeling and simulation levels. ...|$|R

Planned and {{developed}} under BMW ownership {{the third generation}} was to <b>share</b> <b>components</b> and systems (electronics, core power units etc.) with the BMW 7 Series (E38). It was designed to accommodate BMW's 4.4 litre M62 V8 engines for future models. The manual transmission was dropped entirely, leaving only the automatic. The 7 Series electronics system was being phased out during {{the development of the}} third-generation Range Rover and being replaced with the electronics from the BMW 5 Series (E39). Note that there were three [...] "Generations" [...] of the L322, from 2002 until 2005 was the aforementioned M62 BMW V8 with ZF 5HP-24 transmission, going along to 2006 until 2009 a 4.4-litre Jaguar derived engine alongside a 4.2-litre supercharged variant of the Jag engine partnered with the ZF 6HP-26 transmission. In 2010 Land Rover fitted the newly designed 5.0 N/A and Supercharged engine with ZF 6HP-26 until the 2012 model year, which saw the end of the L322 production.

40|$|Protein {{complexes}} perform {{many important}} {{functions in the}} cell. Large-scale studies of protein-protein interactions have not only revealed new complexes but have also placed many proteins into multiple complexes. Whilst the advocates of hypothesis-free research touted the discovery of these <b>shared</b> <b>components</b> as new links between diverse cellular processes, critical commentators denounced many of the findings as artefacts, thus questioning the usefulness of large-scale approaches. Here, we survey proteins known to be shared between complexes, as established in the literature, and compare them to <b>shared</b> <b>components</b> found in high-throughput screens. We discuss the various challenges to the identification and functional interpretation of bona fide <b>shared</b> <b>components,</b> namely contaminants, variant and megacomplexes, and transient interactions, and suggest {{that many of the}} novel <b>shared</b> <b>components</b> found in high-throughput screens are neither the results of contamination nor central components, but appear to be primarily regulatory links in cellular processes...|$|R
40|$|Gender {{variation}} in the spatial pattern of alcohol-related deaths in South Yorkshire, UK for the period 1999 and 2003 was explored using two Bayesian modelling approaches. Firstly, separate models were fitted to male and female deaths, each with a fixed effect deprivation covariate and a random effect with unstructured and spatially structured terms. In a modification to the initial models, covariates were assumed estimated with error rather than known with certainty. In the second modelling approach male and female deaths were modelled jointly with a <b>shared</b> <b>component</b> for random effects. A range of different unstructured and spatially structured specifications for the shared and gender-specific random effects were fitted. In the best fitting <b>shared</b> <b>component</b> model a spatially structured prior was assumed for the <b>shared</b> <b>component,</b> while gender-specific components were assumed unstructured. Deprivation coefficients and random effect standard deviations were very similar between the gender-specific and <b>shared</b> <b>component</b> models. In each case the effect of deprivation was observed to be greater in males than in females, and slightly larger in the measurement error models than in the fixed covariate models. Greater variation was observed in the spatially smoothed estimates of risk for males versus females in both gender-specific and <b>shared</b> <b>component</b> models. The <b>shared</b> <b>component</b> explained {{a greater proportion of}} the male risk than it did the female risk. The analysis approach reveals the residual (unexplained by deprivation) gender-specific and shared risk surfaces, information which may be useful for guiding public health action...|$|R

30|$|Research work on multitenancy has {{acknowledged}} that there are varying degrees of isolation tenants accessing a multitenant cloud-hosted service [11 â€“ 14]. Chong and Carraro discuss three approaches to managing multi-tenant data, and it is stated that {{the distinction between the}} shared data and isolated data is more of a continuum, where many variations are possible between the two extremes [11]. Three multitenancy patterns have been identified which express the degree of isolation between tenants accessing a <b>shared</b> <b>component</b> of an application [3]. These patterns are referred to as <b>shared</b> <b>component,</b> tenant-isolated component and dedicated <b>component.</b> The <b>shared</b> <b>component</b> represents the lowest degree of isolation between tenants while the dedicated component represents the highest. The degree of isolation between tenants accessing a tenant-isolated component would be in the middle.|$|R

40|$|Background and aims: The aim of {{this study}} was the {{modeling}} of the incidence rates of Colorectal, breast and prostate cancers using a <b>shared</b> <b>component</b> model in order to explore the spatial pattern of their shared risk factors (i. e., obesity and low physical activity) affecting on cancer incidence, and also to estimate the relative weight of these <b>shared</b> <b>components.</b> Methods: In this study, the new cases of colorectal, breast and prostate cancers information provided by the Management Center of Ministry of Health and Medical Education in 2009 were analyzed. The Bayesian <b>shared</b> <b>component</b> model was used. In addition, BYM (Besag, York and Mollie) model was applied to investigate the geographical pattern of disease incidence rates, individually. Results: The larger effect of obesity on the incidence of the relevant cancers was found in Ardabil, West Azarbaijan, Gilan, Zanjan, Kurdistan, Qazvin, Tehran, Mazandaran, Hamadan, Kermanshah, Semnan, Golestan, Yazd and Kerman, and this component was more important for prostate cancer compared to colorectal and breast cancers. In addition, low physical activity <b>shared</b> <b>component</b> had more effect on the incidence of colorectal and breast cancers in Ardabil, Zanjan, Qazvin, Tehran, Mazandaran, Markazi, Lorestan, Kermanshah, Ilam, Khuzestan, South Khorasan, Yazd, Kerman and Fars, and also, this component was more important for Breast cancer compared to Colorectal cancer. Conclusion: Based on deviance Information criterion, combined modeling of three understudy cancers using a <b>shared</b> <b>component</b> model was better than modeling them individually using BYM model...|$|R
30|$|As {{pointed out}} in the case study {{involving}} continuous integration with Hudson, the CPU consumption of tenants changed significantly for the <b>shared</b> <b>component.</b> Therefore, on a private cloud which supports a small number of tenants, the <b>shared</b> <b>component</b> can be used to optimise CPU utilisation. However, there would be no guarantee of a high degree of isolation between tenants. In CI, builds are known to consume a vast amount of disk I/O, and so a dedicated component can be used for running (i) large number of builds concurrently, and (ii) builds that are too complex [32]. Again if the <b>shared</b> <b>component</b> is used to deploy Bugzilla (where mod_perl is enabled) on the same type of cloud infrastructure described above, then minimising RAM consumption would be the main issue of concern, and not CPU [34]. This means that it is better to use a dedicated component for heavy and complex tasks (e.g., builds with multiple dependencies) and a <b>shared</b> <b>component</b> for light tasks. For example, in large projects, multiple builds interact with multiple components to create several inter-dependencies with each other which will consume more resources.|$|R
