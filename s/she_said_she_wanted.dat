She did {{not want}} its events to be taken literally, but {{to be understood as}} a representation of different ways of approaching life. Andre represents an ambitious, confident, non-conformist approach to life, while the prosecution witnesses represent conformity, envy of success, and the desire for power over others. Rand believed the jury's decision at each performance revealed the attitude of the jurors towards these two conflicting senses of life. Rand supported individualism and considered Andre [...] "not guilty". <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> the play to convey the viewpoint: [...] "Your life, your achievement, your happiness, [...] are of paramount importance. Live up to your highest vision of yourself no matter what the circumstances you might encounter. An exalted view of self-esteem is man's most admirable quality". She said the play [...] "is not a philosophical treatise on morality" [...] and represents this view only in a basic way. Rand would later expound an explicit philosophy, which she called [...] "Objectivism", particularly in her 1957 novel Atlas Shrugged and in non-fiction essays, but Night of January 16th predates these more philosophical works.|$|E
