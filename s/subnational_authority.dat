40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the interaction between}} constitutional design and practice through {{a case study of}} Canadian federalism. Focusing on the federal architecture of the Canadian Constitution, the paper examines how subnational units in Canada actually compete with the central government, emphasizing the concrete strategies and tactics they most commonly employ to get their way in confrontations with central authority. The evidence affirms that constitutional design and structure make an important difference in the tactics and tools available to subnational units in a federal system, but that design is not fully constraining: there is considerable evidence of extraconstitutional innovation and improvisation by governments. Furthermore, changes in practice initiated by Canadian subnational actors have produced changes in the allocation of national and <b>subnational</b> <b>authority</b> that are plausibly characterized as constitutional in magnitude. The paper concludes that the design of the Canadian federal system may inadvertently undermine its capacity to stabilize itself at any particular point of constitutional evolution, making it “permanently provisional. ...|$|E

In this article, we redress this bias by investigating the formal role of <b>subnational</b> <b>authorities</b> in theimplementation of EU regulatory policies, specifically in the transposition of directives. <b>Subnational</b> <b>authorities</b> play a secondary, but increasingly important, role in the application of these measures. Their impact is greater on environmental and social policies, as also on public contract legislation. More decentralized states display higher levels of subnational involvement but, in these states, regional participation in national policymaking and a high number of regional authorities decrease the likelihood of finding subnational measures of transposition. There is also more subnational involvement in states with territories that have both an elected government as well as special arrangements regulating their relations with the EU. Finally, subnational involvement tends to prolong the process of transposition. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{top-down}} analysis reveals {{that there is}} a change in the relationship between national and <b>subnational</b> <b>authorities</b> which {{can be attributed to the}} challenges facing industrialized countries in general, and European Union (EU) member states in particular. Indeed, in the 1980 s, the region has been rediscovered by political economists, political scientists, and sociologists. On the one hand, people are turning to their territory as a way of reclaiming what is threatened. On the other, the region can portray itself as an asset on the global market because it is often better able to interact with the growing number of small and medium- sized firms. Decentralization has taken place across much of Europe; reforming the structures of subnational government can be seen as another attempt to modernize political systems. There is also a connection between EU structural policy and decentralization. In the post- 1988 period, structural funds provided an opportunity for <b>subnational</b> <b>authorities</b> to influence EU decision-making, and have provoked a decentralist response from central and <b>subnational</b> <b>authorities</b> (Marks, 1992; Bullmann, 1997; Jeffery, 1997). Structural programmes attempt to alleviate economic disparities through transfers and to enhance the competitive capacity of regions. They also seek to arm regions with the necessary infrastructure and skills needed to compete in the internal market. Politically, one aim is to gain the support of peripheral actors by showing themthe benefits of EU membership. More importantly, there are prerequisites as to process which respect the principles of subsidiarity and partnership with the regions which can empower regional actors. (author's abstract...|$|R
40|$|Government {{authority}} in China, while constitutionally organized as a unitary sovereign, is, in practice, a complex system of informal and formal divisions of authority between national, provincial, and local political actors. In {{the context of}} water pollution control, an issue of considerable interest in China, both central and <b>subnational</b> <b>authorities</b> have key roles. The incentives faced by some officials, however, are ill-aligned with environmental protection, predictably leading to inefficiently high levels of pollution.

Although these reforms have strong potential, they can be improved with stronger environmental incentives for national officials, less intra-bureaucratic tension, expanded river basin planning, and experimentation with compensation mechanisms and trading to reduce regional disparities.

40|$|It is {{characteristic}} of federal states that the scope of subnational power and autonomy are subjects of frequent dispute, and that disagreements over the reach of national and subnational power may be contested in a wide and diverse array of settings. Subnational units determined to challenge nationally-imposed limits on their power typically have at their disposal many tools with which to press against formal boundaries. Federal systems, moreover, frequently display a surprising degree of tolerance for subnational obstruction, disobedience, and other behaviors intended to expand <b>subnational</b> <b>authority</b> and influence, even over national objection. This tolerance, however, has limits. In this paper, we examine a set of rulings by national constitutional courts invalidating formalized claims by subnational units to a distinctive subnational identity. The emphatically negative reactions of these courts contrast instructively with the tolerance often displayed by other state actors toward similar identity claims when they are asserted in political and sub-constitutional settings, suggesting that the legal formalization of distinctive identity claims is perceived by courts to pose an unusually acute threat to the state...|$|E

40|$|An {{arena in}} which the {{implications}} of increased <b>subnational</b> <b>authority</b> are particularly important is the European Union. In addition to the decentralization process experienced throughout Europe, the EU states also are undergoing the simultaneous process of supranational institution-building. We see increasing interest in regions and other subnational govemments and groups {{on the part of}} the EU, such as the long-standing importance placed on regional/structural policy and the recent creation of the Committee of the Regions in an advisory capacity. In turn, the emergence of subnational entities with increased political and economic power has potentially important consequences for European integration. The current paper first critiques the disparate literature that studies the transfer of governmental authority to a lower level within the nation-state. It then argues that an altemative conceptualization, "redistribution of authority", based on the institutional capacities, functional scope and resources available to various governmental and nongovernmental entities, best captures this complex phenomenon and allows us to analyze its causes and consequences. The study further proposes that as a result of this redistribution of authority, a complex policy network is emerging. The prevailing theories of integration are critiqued in terms of these theories' ability to include the complex dynamics of interaction among supranational, national and subnational levels in Europe resulting from the redistribution of authority and proliferation of decision-making centers. Finally, a preliminary research framework is provided within which propositions regarding the redistribution of authority, the resulting complex policy network, and the consequences for the economic and political development of the EU may be examined...|$|E

The <b>subnational</b> <b>authorities</b> most active in promoting regional cooperation tend to be those in the NET (natural economic territories) around the rim of Japan Sea.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to explain}} why and how after a {{comprehensive}} set of decentralising processes, Colombia experienced significant recentralising policies and reforms (1994 - 2014). These changes emerged not only against what was expected by leading works on decentralisation in Latin America, {{but in a way}} that the existing hypotheses on recentralisation cannot fully account for. This is a hypothesis-generating case study. The growing literature on recentralisation is still very limited. With few exceptions, there are no big theoretical efforts. In general, the case studies assume temporal causal homogeneity. The analyses are excessively focused on the impact of only one type of factor (economic, political or administrative), instead of on the interactions between them. And they are excessively focused on the national governments, while neglecting the explanation of the role of legislators and <b>subnational</b> <b>authorities.</b> Using process-tracing and combining evidence from documentary sources and elite interviews, the thesis suggests that Colombia's recentralisation was an outcome of the interaction between economic inputs and institutional context. When an economic crisis takes place in a decentralised context, one can expect an increase of recentralisation. If an economic boom occurs in the same context, one should expect a decrease of recentralisation. If there is an economic crisis in a recentralised context, one can expect less recentralisation. If, instead, an economic boom occurs in the same context, one should expect even more recentralisation. The causal mechanisms are self-destroying/self-reinforcing dynamics. The thesis provides a deep analysis of the Colombian case plus an updated review of the literature. It also aims to tackle the main definitional issues and brings new concepts for the analysis of the recentralising strategies used by national and intermediate levels of government. Noteworthy, it offers a hypothesis that identifies the relevance of changing institutional contexts, the interactions between different types of factors, and the role of legislators and <b>subnational</b> <b>authorities.</b> Still, this thesis does not aim to propose a general theory of recentralisation. </p...|$|R

Contrary to widespread belief, the trias politica as an ideology of disjointed powers and separate spheres cannot be traced back to Montesquieu's theory of law, but only from its philosophical rebuttal and inaccurate reception in subsequent times.

In spite of the substantial differences in the tradition and current practice of intergovernmental fiscal relations, transition economies may learn valuable lessons from the Swiss case {{in the fields of}} direct democracy, horizontal cooperation, expenditure and revenue assignment, and fiscal discipline. Among other conclusions, the authors suggest that <b>subnational</b> <b>authorities</b> can effectively fend off recentralization attempts of the central government if they engage in spontaneous cooperation to enhance the efficiency of public service provision. Together with an adequate fiscal equalization scheme, interjurisdictional cooperation also permits the reconciliation of the objective of an increasing devolution of powers with the existing regional disparities. The authors also show that the principle of subsidiarity can best be safeguarded by anchoring the expenditure and revenue powers of subnational governments in the constitution or in a similarly strong law. With regard to fiscal discipline, the combination of a"golden rule"with direct democratic instruments of budget control is proven to be successful in enhancing the accountability of local politicians toward their constituencies. ...|$|R
40|$|This article, {{which forms}} {{part of the}} ‘New Voices’ series and is hence drafted as an essay rather than a proper {{academic}} article, examines the principle of subsidiarity in its application to {{local and regional authorities}} as they exist within the various Member States.

This is so in particular after Article 5 (3) TEU has been amended {{on the occasion of the}} Lisbon Treaty revision to include an express reference to local and regional authorities. This short essay challenges this perception of subsidiarity, putting forward that the core legal provisions that deal with subsidiarity in EU law do not allocate any meaningful role for SNAs.

Since the Russian Federation passed the new Land Code in 2001, land privatization has been officially encouraged {{by the federal government}} and in particular, land under previously privatized buildings was supposed to be privatized to the owner at a nominal price. The paper shows that many <b>subnational</b> <b>authorities</b> (which own or control the vast majority of land of interest to businesses) appear to use a combination of high statutory land buy-out prices and administrative barriers to deter land privatization and to offer"long-term leases"(which are not fully marketable) instead. On the other hand, regions that have established low buy-out prices and taken steps to remove unnecessary administrative barriers to land privatization appear to have higher rates of land ownership by businesses, and to face lower levels of corruption in the privatization process. The paper concludes that further reductions in the statutory prices for privatization of land under buildings and elimination of unnecessary administrative barriers should help to encourage further land privatization {{and the development of a}} competitive, secondary market in commercial land.

Researchers and practitioners are increasingly appreciating that accounting for the stated needs of communities supports the process of pro-poor public resource allocation. We examine four institutional arrangements that explicitly endeavor to make public spending responsive {{to the needs of the}} poor by moving decision-making procedures closer to the population—participatory budgeting, community-driven development (CDD) programs, decentralization, and delegated targeting of transfers. Using the existing literature, we compare experiences across the four arrangements and countries. Regarding responsiveness to needs of the poor, evidence is cautiously optimistic for participatory budgeting, CDD, and decentralization. As for delegating the targeting of transfers to <b>subnational</b> <b>authorities</b> and communities, evidence suggests that the effect may be regressive. However, there are important mediating effects of public spending responsiveness under the various institutional arrangements. Local elite capture is a key factor dampening pro-poor spending where either exogenous circumstances such as prevailing inequality, or inadequate program design, enable capture to materialize.

In countries that have experienced decentralisation processes, the role that central and sub-national authorities play in the governance of some social policies may vary considerably across regions. In Italy, for instance, whereas some regions (and municipalities) have been very active in financing social assistance programmes, others still overwhelmingly rely on resources directly allocated by the central government. This indicates that, in a ‘regionalised’ system, {{the development of a}} sub-national social dimension is not a territorially homogeneous phenomenon. Interestingly, cross-regional variation is mainly explained by differences in the strength of regionalist parties. The share of total social assistance spending allocated by <b>subnational</b> <b>authorities</b> has increased significantly in those areas of the country where regionalist parties are stronger and does not seem to depend on ideological shifts on the left-right spectrum.

Paper analyses some elements of economy of scale Croatian municipality activities, regard of their stake in public expenditure, employment and total municipality’s expenditures. Also, regard of permanent dilemma: small or big local units, article analyses democratic aspect of local election respond, and certainly cost of local democracy. According EU average, there are not great differences between Croatian municipalities and most local authorities at the EU countries. Most territorial organizations at the EU countries still have very fragmentarily space with modest decentralization. All efforts show significant obstacles in territorial consolidation implementation reforms. Results show that Croatian local authorities have not considerable economic scale, except Zagreb City. Namely, only Zagreb City in two key facts of economy of scale: number of inhabitancies and total expenditures, participated considerable more than others local units in public expenditures, although only with two percent in GDP...|$|R
