5|$|In November 2012, The FreeBSD <b>Security</b> <b>Team</b> {{announced}} that hackers gained unauthorized access {{on two of}} the project's servers. These servers were turned off immediately. More research demonstrated that the first unauthorized access by hackers occurred on 19 September. Apparently hackers gained access to these servers by stealing SSH keys from one of the developers, not by exploiting a bug in the operating system itself. These two hacked servers were part of the infrastructure used to build third-party software packages. The FreeBSD <b>Security</b> <b>Team</b> checked the integrity of the binary packages and {{announced that}} no unauthorized change was made to the binary packages, but they stated that they can't guarantee the integrity of packages that were downloaded between 19 September and 11 November.|$|E

It is {{supported}} by the Debian <b>Security</b> <b>Team</b> until one year after a new stable is released, and since the release of Debian 6, for another 2 years through the Long Term Support project.

5|$|Pre-production {{continued}} on Iris as it drew increasing attention {{not only in}} Korea but also in Japan due to Lee's involvement. Kim Seung-woo and Jung Joon-ho were also cast {{as the head of}} the North Korean <b>security</b> <b>team</b> and Kim Hyun-jun's lifelong friend, respectively.|$|E

In furtherance of this, he appointed Garry McCarthy, former deputy commissioner of operations of the New York City Police Department, {{as director of the}} Newark Police Department. Crime reduction was such a central concern to the Booker administration that Booker, along with his <b>security</b> <b>team,</b> was known to personally patrol the streets of Newark until as late as 4a.m.|$|E
5|$|The stable {{branch is}} {{supported}} by the Debian security team; oldstable is supported for one year. Although Squeeze is not officially supported, Debian is coordinating an effort to provide long-term support (LTS) until February 2016, five years after the initial release, but only for the IA-32 and x86-64 platforms. Testing {{is supported by}} the testing <b>security</b> <b>team,</b> but does not receive updates in as timely a manner as stable. Unstables security is left for the package maintainers.|$|E
5|$|Some {{historians have}} argued that the Ford {{administration}} felt the need to respond forcefully to the incident because it was construed as a Soviet plot. But work by Andrew Gawthorpe, published in 2009, based on an analysis of the administration's internal discussions, shows that Ford's national <b>security</b> <b>team</b> understood that the seizure of the vessel was a local, and perhaps even accidental, provocation by an immature Khmer government. Nevertheless, they felt the need to respond forcefully to discourage further provocations by other Communist countries in Asia.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} shot in Jordan, within miles of the Iraqi border, to achieve Bigelow's goal of authenticity. Iraqi {{refugees}} were used for extras and the cast worked in the intense heat of the Middle East. The filmmakers had scouted for locations in Morocco, but director Kathryn Bigelow felt its cities did not resemble Baghdad. In addition, {{she wanted to get}} as close to the war zone as possible. Some of the locations were less than three miles from the Iraq border. She had wanted to film in Iraq, but the production <b>security</b> <b>team</b> could not guarantee their safety from snipers.|$|E

(Mumtaz Qadri {{was sentenced to death}} for the assassination and hanged on 29 February 2016.) Taseer was outspoken in his criticism of the law and the verdict in Noreen's case. The next day, thousands turned up for {{the governor}}'s funeral in Lahore in spite of warnings by the Taliban and some clerics, while a portion of the Pakistani population also praised Qadri as a hero; thousands of Sunni Muslims rallied in support of the blasphemy laws in Pakistan after the murder, and 500 Barelvi clerics prohibited their followers from sending condolences to the family of Taseer. This resulted in concerns that the public was becoming tolerant of extremists.|$|E
