60|$|Here {{he came to}} a <b>dead</b> <b>stop,</b> {{and made}} so long a pause that even John Willet grew {{impatient}} and asked why he did not proceed.|$|R
60|$|But Frank {{had come}} to a <b>dead</b> <b>stop</b> in the dim, dull, wood-panelled hall. In front of them rose the stairs with old-fashioned banisters, cracked, warped, and dusty.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly the pursued {{came to a}} <b>dead</b> <b>stop</b> {{and gazed}} for twenty minutes in at a pastry-cook's window. Andrew waited for him. Then they started off again, much more leisurely.|$|R

6000|$|Charnock looked unusually thoughtful. [...] "The {{engineer}} had {{to start}} from a <b>dead</b> <b>stop</b> and turn on full steam. That made the jarring worse, but it wouldn't happen with the ordinary traffic." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes!" [...] said I. And {{although}} my sister instantly boxed my ears, it was highly gratifying {{to me to}} see that the answer spoilt his joke, and brought him to a <b>dead</b> <b>stop.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{boats were}} now {{quite close to}} the yacht, which had slowed down almost to a <b>dead</b> <b>stop.</b> In answer to the query of the Lotus' captain Skipper Simms was {{explaining}} their trouble.|$|R
5000|$|... the Romanian deadlift is a {{variation}} on the stiff-legged named for Nicu Vlad. As it begins at the top and does not begin the concentric from a <b>dead</b> <b>stop,</b> it is alternatively called an undead lift.|$|R
2500|$|Salmon taxied the XFV-1 on its {{temporary}} gear [...] "from {{a standing}} start to 175 mph, and then {{brought it back}} down to a <b>dead</b> <b>stop</b> without any use of the brakes, all within a distance of one mile." ...|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} we were deep {{in the shadow of}} the Blessington lower road and the 'rickshaw came to a <b>dead</b> <b>stop</b> under a pine-clad, over-hanging shale cliff. Instinctively I halted too, giving my reason. Heatherlegh rapped out an oath.|$|R
60|$|After {{that the}} {{collection}} {{came to a}} <b>dead</b> <b>stop.</b> For a while I {{used to talk about}} it rather airily and say I had one or two rather valuable South African stamps. But I presently grew tired even of lying about it.|$|R
60|$|There was {{something}} strange about Andrew's manner {{as he moved}} up to Duncombe's side. The latter, who was in curiously high spirits, talked incessantly for several minutes. Then {{he came to a}} <b>dead</b> <b>stop.</b> He was aware that his friend was not listening.|$|R

60|$|Yet {{he pressed}} on, calling again and again, but {{receiving}} no answer. Twice he imagined he heard pistol shots, and this {{gave him the}} idea of firing his own weapon, and he emptied the cylinder, but with no good to himself. Then he reloaded {{and came to a}} <b>dead</b> <b>stop.</b> He had never been more lonely in his life.|$|R
50|$|Rocket {{assisted}} descent (RAD) motors: Because {{the atmospheric}} density of Mars {{is less than}} 1% of Earth's, the parachute alone could not slow down the Mars Exploration Rover enough to ensure a safe, low landing speed. The spacecraft descent was assisted by rockets that brought the spacecraft to a <b>dead</b> <b>stop</b> 10-15 m (30-50 ft) above the Martian surface.|$|R

5000|$|The Variety {{reviewer}} wrote, [...] "Trademark of John Ford's {{direction is}} clearly stamped {{on the film}} with its shadowy lights, softly contrasted moods and measured pace, but a tendency is discernible towards stylization {{for the sake of}} stylization. At several points, the pic comes to a <b>dead</b> <b>stop</b> to let Ford go gunning for some arty effect".|$|R
5000|$|AllMusic {{writes that}} [...] "2 + 2" [...] is [...] "a frightening, visceral song that stands {{among the best}} anti-Vietnam protests." [...] The {{original}} studio version had a <b>dead</b> <b>stop,</b> or sudden cut to silence, placed near the end. On the 45 version, however, there is a guitar chord added {{at this point in}} the song, because radio stations fear dead air.|$|R
60|$|They turned, and Clennam said, Here was Maggy coming! Little Dorrit looked up, surprised, {{and they}} confronted Maggy, who brought herself at {{sight of them}} to a <b>dead</b> <b>stop.</b> She had been {{trotting}} along, so preoccupied and busy {{that she had not}} recognised them until they turned upon her. She was now in a moment so conscience-stricken that her very basket partook of the change.|$|R
25|$|In October 2012, Lexus {{staged a}} {{race as a}} result of a charity bet between pilot Marc Arnold and Kent Stevinson to race a Lexus LFA against an Eclipse 500 jet. The top speed of the LFA is 203mph while the Eclipse 500 can reach speeds of 400mph. In order to make it a fair test to measure acceleration, handling, braking, {{according}} to Paul Williamson the race took place on a 4800 feet runway. The plane was given a head start of about 110mph with the Lexus LFA launching from a <b>dead</b> <b>stop</b> as the jet flew by at 110mph. As the race begun, the plane started accelerating from 110mph and Lexus LFA launched from a <b>dead</b> <b>stop.</b> Both accelerated to the end of the runway where the LFA will have to brake and turn around with the plane turning around as well. Then it was a race all the way back to the starting line with the LFA needing to brake before the plane in order for the Lexus LFA to win the race. The proceeds of the win were to benefit charities. Lexus decided to choose the Lexus LFA Nurburgring Edition for the race and professional race car driver and champion Scott Pruett was selected as the driver for the Lexus LFA. Once the race was complete, the Lexus LFA was able to win through completing the race including a full <b>dead</b> <b>stop</b> at the end before the plane cleared the finish line 2 seconds ahead of the Eclipse 500 jet. The Lexus LFA hit a maximum speed of 171mph before it hit the braking zone.|$|R

6000|$|... "See how beautifully it works." [...] Pericord {{stretched}} out a thin, nervous hand, and pressed a button upon the machine. The joints revolved more slowly, and came presently to a <b>dead</b> <b>stop.</b> Again he touched a spring and the arms shivered {{and woke up}} again into their crisp metallic life.

40|$|Inspiration is {{necessary}} for the processes of discovery not to run down and come to a <b>dead</b> <b>stop.</b> Inspiration comes along with, or as a result of, insight: the power of seeing into an event.

5|$|The torpedo bombers {{attacked}} Giffen's {{ships in}} two waves between 19:00 and 20:00. Two torpedoes hit the heavy cruiser , causing heavy damage and bringing {{her to a}} <b>dead</b> <b>stop.</b> Three of the Japanese aircraft were shot down by anti-aircraft fire from Giffen's ships. In response, Halsey sent a tug to take Chicago under tow and ordered Giffen's task force to return to base the next day. Six destroyers were left behind to escort Chicago and the tugboat.|$|R
60|$|De Catinat {{was filled}} with amazement at this marvellous man who could hear in his sleep and could detect a trail when the very tree-trunks were {{invisible}} to ordinary eyes. Du Lhut halted a little to watch the canoes, and then turned {{his back to the}} river, and plunged into the woods once more. They had gone a mile or two when suddenly he came to a <b>dead</b> <b>stop,</b> snuffing at the air like a hound on a scent.|$|R

2500|$|Vanderlip {{described}} the Corwin's action as an icebreaker: [...] "Some {{of the ice}} the Corwin can push to {{one side or the}} other but when this is not possible she backs up in order to get good headway and charges the obstruction and strikes it fairly between the eyes. She comes to a <b>dead</b> <b>stop</b> and quivers from stem to stern with the tremendous impact A rending grinding noise is heard and the berg which challenged us is a berg no longer..." ...|$|R
500|$|The Economist {{described}} Henson's Saturday Night Live {{characters as}} his odd {{children who were}} known to muse about aspects of philosophy. DVD Talk described The Land of Gorch as the most serious mistake from the first season of Saturday Night Live, adding that the characters lacked humor and that {{the length of the}} sketches brought each episode to a <b>dead</b> <b>stop.</b> Author Wesley Hyatt said the only redeeming scene from the sketches was a duet between Lily Tomlin and Scred, singing [...] "I Got You Babe".|$|R
6000|$|Presently {{he came to}} a <b>dead</b> <b>stop</b> {{in front}} of a shop where a large mirror {{presented}} him with a full-length portrait of himself, and again he said mentally, [...] "Can it be possible!" [...] for, since quitting London he had never seen himself as others saw him, having been too hurried, on both occasions of passing through Canadian cities, to note the mirrors there. In the backwoods, of course, there was nothing large enough in the way of mirror to show more than his good-looking face.|$|R
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} the deer and the hare were lashed to the sledge--which the Irishman {{asserted}} was a great improvement, inasmuch as the carcass of the former made an excellent seat--and they were off again at full gallop over the floes. They travelled without further interruption or mishap until they drew near to the open water, when suddenly they came upon a deep fissure or crack in the ice, about four feet wide, with water in the bottom. Here they came to a <b>dead</b> <b>stop.</b>|$|R
