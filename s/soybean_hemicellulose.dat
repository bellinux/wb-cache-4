40|$|The Committee {{is asked}} to {{evaluate}} the safety of <b>soybean</b> <b>hemicellulose</b> {{to be used as}} a food additive, as emulsifier, thickener, stabiliser and anti-caking agent. Background In general terms, hemicelluloses are defined as cell wall polysaccharides extractable in dilute sodium hydroxide solutions. It includes all the cell wall polysaccharides except cellulose and pectin. On hydrolysis, hemicelluloses yield an abundance of pentose sugars along with d-glucuronic acid and some deoxy sugars (Macrea et al, 1993). <b>Soybean</b> <b>hemicellulose</b> is extracted from soy fibre. Soy fibre is a mixture of cellulosic and non-cellulosic structural components of the internal cell wall of soybeans. Its major fractions are non-cellulosic. (Aspinall et al., 1967). The raw material (‘Okara’) from which the soluble hemicellulose is extracted, is a high-fibre containing by-product of the soy oil and soy protein production process. Soy fibre can be added to many food systems and is available in various forms that are tailored to specific applications. In the US different soy-fibre sources are used in liquid diets, specifically hospital enteral nutrition formula, low-calorie breads and baked goods including muffins, cookie...|$|E
