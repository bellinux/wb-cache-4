5|$|One of Groves' early {{problems}} {{was to find}} a director for Project Y, the group that would design and build the bomb. The obvious choice was one of the three laboratory heads, Urey, Lawrence, or Compton, but they could not be spared. Compton recommended Oppenheimer, who was already intimately familiar with the bomb design concepts. However, Oppenheimer had little administrative experience, and, unlike Urey, Lawrence, and Compton, had not won a Nobel Prize, which many scientists felt that the head of such an important laboratory should have. There were also concerns about Oppenheimer's <b>security</b> <b>status,</b> as many of his associates were Communists, including his brother, Frank Oppenheimer; his wife, Kitty; and his girlfriend, Jean Tatlock. A long conversation on a train in October 1942 convinced Groves and Nichols that Oppenheimer thoroughly understood the issues involved in setting up a laboratory in a remote area and should be appointed as its director. Groves personally waived the security requirements and issued Oppenheimer a clearance on 20 July 1943.|$|E

30|$|After categorizing {{households}} as food {{secure and}} insecure, {{the next step}} was to identify variables that have an association with food security at household level. The dependent variable (household food security) is dichotomous in nature (food secure and food insecure households); the binary logistic regression model was used as the estimated probabilities that lie between the logical limit of 0 and 1 (Gujarati 1995). Hence, food <b>security</b> <b>statuses</b> were expressed by a binary dependent variable (0 = food insecure households and 1 = food secure households).|$|R
25|$|The {{economic}} impact of inadequate sanitation has been estimated at 344 billion Rupees (US$5.7 billion), equivalent to almost 4 percent of GDP. 87% of the impact is on health, 5% on increased costs of water supply and 8% are other impacts. The main health impacts are premature mortality and productivity losses, followed by treatment costs. Water supply costs include higher costs for the supply of piped water, higher expenses for bottled water {{and the cost of}} household water treatment. Other costs include the cost of increased time for open defecation and the use of shared toilets, and a relatively small cost of lost tourism revenues. Many intangible costs {{were not included in the}} estimate, such as the lack of privacy, <b>security,</b> <b>status</b> and dignity. The cost of environmental conditions stemming from poor sanitation was also not included in the estimate.|$|E
25|$|It is {{impossible}} to discuss motivation and job attributes in I–O psychology without crediting Frederick Herzberg's Motivator–Hygiene Theory (also referred to as Herzberg's Two-factor theory). Published in 1968, Herzberg's Motivator–Hygiene Theory holds that the content of a person's job is {{the primary source of}} motivation. In other words, he argued against the commonly held belief that money and other compensation is the most effective form of motivation to an employee. Instead, Herzberg posed that high levels of what he dubbed hygiene factors (pay, job <b>security,</b> <b>status,</b> working conditions, fringe benefits, job policies, and relations with co-workers) could only reduce employee dissatisfaction (not create satisfaction). Motivation factors (level of challenge, the work itself, responsibility, recognition, advancement, intrinsic interest, autonomy, and opportunities for creativity) however, could stimulate satisfaction within the employee, provided that minimum levels of the hygiene factors were reached. For an organization {{to take full advantage of}} Herzberg's theory, they must design jobs in such a way that motivators are built in, and thus are intrinsically rewarding. While the Motivation–Hygiene Theory was the first to focus on job content, it has not been strongly supported through empirical studies.|$|E

Because these activities are considered to be [...] "illegal" [...] within the game mechanics, pirate characters often will have low <b>security</b> <b>status</b> and may even be branded as outlaws by CONCORD. Likewise, victims of overt piracy may retaliate without intervention from CONCORD, often via an expressed right to destroy the pirate ship (i.e., [...] "kill right"). Although piracy activities are [...] "illegal" [...] within the game universe, they are not against the rules of the game, i.e., there will only be in-game retaliation and punishment for them.|$|E

Officials stated {{that there were no}} credible threats to major airports in the U.S. In Indonesia, security at major international airports, such as Soekarno - Hatta International Airport in Jakarta, was tightened. Indonesian Transportation Minister Ignasius Jonan stated that the <b>security</b> <b>status</b> in every airport in Indonesia was alerted to yellow, meaning that an attack in airport was [...] "likely". He also added that major seaports in Indonesia were also heightened their security. In India, the security in several major airports, such as Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport in Sahar was beefed up; security was also stepped up at the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Colaba, one of the sites of the 2008 Mumbai attacks.

2500|$|On 27 October 1964, USS Seadragon {{became the}} first nuclear powered vessel to visit Hong Kong. This was {{followed}} shortly by an historic entry into Japanese waters and a port visit to Sasebo, Japan, on 12 November 1964. The visit was protested by China and the Soviet Union; the Soviets in particular warned that the visit would eventually lead {{to the introduction of}} nuclear weapons to Japan and alter the <b>security</b> <b>status</b> quo in East Asia. On 4 March 1965, she returned to Pearl Harbor. Again, in the fall of 1966 and early 1967, SEADRAGON {{became the first}} SSN to visit Yokosuka, Japan. She was the first nuclear powered vessel the Japanese government permitted to enter her home waters. This achievement has since often been compared with Commodore PERRY's first expedition to Japan in 1853 as an achievement in international diplomacy. SEADRAGON again set the standard by being the first SSN to visit Hobart, Australia in January 1983. [...] In twenty-four years of active service, SEADRAGON steamed over 200,000 miles, dove and surfaced 1800 times, made thirteen deployments to the Western Pacific, and conducted four under ice operations. SEADRAGON was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation and the Meritorious Unit Commendation. The ship was overhauled three times, refueling at each overhaul. Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard was her home for all the overhauls and performed the inactivation commencing 1 October 1983. Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, which she visited on occasional trips to the North Polar region, performed the recycling.|$|E
2500|$|The playing {{environment}} in Eve Online consists {{of more than}} 5000 star systems, as well as 2500 randomly accessible wormhole systems, taking place in 23341 C.E. Systems are classified by their <b>Security</b> <b>Status,</b> on a decimal scale from −1.0 to 1.0. These systems are categorized into three groups, each determining the response from CONCORD (Consolidated Co-operation and Relations Command) NPC law enforcement units. Star systems classed as 0.5–1.0 security are considered [...] "high security" [...] and any unauthorized/unprovoked attack by a character on another character anywhere in the system {{will result in the}} appearance of law enforcement. These units will attack and destroy the aggressor, and are designed to reinforce in such strength that they will always win an engagement. However, CONCORD is not preventative, but punitive, meaning there is a short window between beginning an attack and getting destroyed where a player (or group of) can destroy another player's ship. Systems classified as 0.1–0.4 are considered [...] "low security", where CONCORD law enforcement units will not destroy aggressors, but do monitor unprovoked acts of aggression and have automated sentry guns in some locations. Unprovoked attacks will flag the aggressor as a free target for other players, and attacks within sight of sentry guns will cause them to fire on the aggressor. Systems classified 0.0 to −1.0 are called [...] "zero space" [...] or [...] "null sec", and feature no law enforcement; individual systems, or groups of systems, may be controlled by player alliances, up to the creation of player-owned empires reaching across entire [...] "regions" [...] (an aggregate group of star systems). Wormhole systems are accessible only by wormholes that randomly appear and disappear, and are also lawless space, showing as −1.0. However, player-run corporations cannot claim sovereignty in wormhole systems. Star systems contain different types of celestial objects, making them more or less suitable for different kinds of operations. Typically, players find asteroid fields, planets, stations, stargates, and moons in a system. Many of the game's most profitable income sources are found in dangerous null or low security systems, giving players incentive to engage in high-risk, high-reward activities in which they must survive the possible harassment of other players who may also enter the system.|$|E

Methods: Study of two retrospective cohorts (Belgium, n =  23, 607; Spain, n =  44, 385) of 50 – 60 year old male employees with 4 years of follow-up. Mortality rate ratios (MRR) were estimated using Poisson regression models. Results: Mortality for subjects with permanent disability {{was higher than}} for the employed, for both Belgium [MRR =  4. 56 (95 % CI: 2. 88 – 7. 21) ] and Spain [MRR =  7. 15 (95 % CI: 5. 37 – 9. 51) ]. For the unemployed/early retirees, mortality was higher in Spain [MRR =  1. 64 (95 % CI: 1. 24 – 2. 17) ] than in Belgium [MRR =  0. 88 (95 % CI: 0. 46 – 1. 71) ]. Conclusion: MRR differences between Belgium and Spain for unemployed workers could be partly explained because of {{differences between the two}} social security systems.

40|$|In {{response}} to the rise in terrorism {{after the turn of}} the millennium, multiculturalist countries such as Australia, Britain and Canada introduced policies that make it easier to revoke the citizenships of dual nationals. These policies primarily target naturalized immigrants and their descendants. Ongoing debates indicate that more countries plan to follow suit. Some scholars argue that easy revocation policies create two-tiered political communities, where one group of citizens have a stronger <b>status</b> <b>security</b> than the other. This study builds on their perspectives, and argues that majority members should be more likely to hold anti-immigrant attitudes in countries where state policies discriminate against citizens in terms of <b>status</b> <b>security.</b> To test this hypothesis, this study employs multilevel regression analysis. Data come from European Values Study (2008), European Social Survey (2014), and Eurobarometer (2015), and cover thirty European countries. Findings offer support for the proposed hypothesis.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to assess the}} impact of trade liberalization on growth, poverty, and food security in India with the help of a national level computable general equilibrium (CGE) model.

Evidence from simulations of (partial) trade reforms reflecting a possible Doha-like scenario show that the bottom 30 % of the population in both rural and urban areas suffer a decline in calorie and protein intake, in contrast to the rest of the population, even as all households increase their intake of fats. Thus, the outcome on food <b>security</b> / <b>status</b> with regard to individual nutrients depends crucially on the movements in the relative prices of different commodities along with the change in income levels.
