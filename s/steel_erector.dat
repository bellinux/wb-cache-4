50|$|A steel {{detailer}} is {{a person}} who produces detailed drawings for steel fabricators and <b>steel</b> <b>erectors.</b> The detailer prepares detailed plans, drawings and other documents for the manufacture and erection of steel members (columns, beams, braces, trusses, stairs, handrails, joists, metal decking, etc.) used in the construction of buildings, bridges, industrial plants, and nonbuilding structures. A steel detailer's projects are usually commercial, residential, public, industrial or municipal; low-rise residential projects..|$|R
50|$|A team of <b>steel</b> <b>erectors</b> {{has been}} redeployed to a steel mill {{construction}} site {{in a small}} town. The head of the squad, Nicholay Pasechnik, is a shockworker of Socialist Labour and reputed to be a darling {{of the women and}} a quick wit. Welder Katerina Petrashen', working on the construction site as well, is to be considered a pretty girl of easy virtue: she smokes (at the time, it was the height of immorality!), is {{not a member of the}} Komsomol, likes party-coloured dresses and behaves provocatively.|$|R
50|$|Erection {{drawings}} {{are used}} to guide the <b>steel</b> <b>erector</b> on the construction site ("in the field") as to where and how to erect the fabricated steel members. These drawings usually show dimensioned plans to locate the steel members, and they often also show details with specific information and requirements, including all work that must {{be done in the}} field (such as bolting, welding or installing wedge anchors). Since the erection drawings are intended for use in the field, they contain very little specific information about the fabrication of any individual steel member; members should already be completed by the time the erection drawings are used.|$|E

40|$|The {{erection}} of a building’s {{structural steel}} frame {{is a major}} construction phase on many a project. The main resource in this process, the <b>steel</b> <b>erector’s</b> crane, defines not only the pace of erection of steel, but also the pace for handling and installing many other structural and non-structural materials. This production system cannot afford any delays. Some claim that structural steel therefore is managed as a just-in-time (JIT) process with materials being delivered to site as needed and installed promptly. This is the case only in appearance as is clear when one considers the JIT principles that were developed as part of Toyota’s lean production philosophy. To illustrate the point, this paper draws on examples of typical structural steel supply chains from the industrial- and building construction sector. The use of symbols from manufacturing is investigated to map key production steps as well as buffers in-between {{them in order to}} elucidate where resources do and do not flow. Industry practices in these two construction sectors vary significantly. Neither one is lean. This paper reports on a preliminary investigation into the location of buffers in the structural steel supply and construction process. The reasons for having buffers at various locations are explored. ...|$|R

5000|$|Die {{grinders}} and rotary {{tools are}} handheld power tools used for grinding, sanding, honing, polishing, or machining material (typically metal, but also plastic or wood). All such tools are conceptually similar, with no bright {{dividing line between}} die grinders and rotary tools, although the die grinder name tends {{to be used for}} pneumatically driven heavy-duty versions whereas the rotary tool name tends to be used for electric lighter-duty versions. Flexible shaft drive versions also exist. The die grinder name comes from one of their earliest and archetypal applications, tool and die work, where they were used to create the precise contours of dies or molds. Especially before the advent of widespread CNC usage, they were heavily relied upon for contouring via manual skill comparable to a sculptor's. CNC now provides much of the contouring for die and mold interior surfaces, but die grinders are still very useful for hundreds of cutting needs, from sculpture-like contouring in the absence of CNC, to cut-off of bar stock, to any of the cutting and grinding needs of fabrication, such as in the work of welders, boilermakers, millwrights, ironworkers (<b>steel</b> <b>erectors),</b> sheet metal workers (such as auto body workers and HVAC technicians), to woodworking (especially cabinet making), hacking, and other hobby or business pursuits. Die grinders are often used for engraving, cylinder head porting, and general shaping of a part.|$|R
5000|$|Contemporary {{critics of}} the scheme accused Bunton - who was close to {{retirement}} at the time - of championing the development as a personal vanity project; he was well known within Glasgow Corporation as a strong proponent of high-rise housing; his practice having designed other similar multi-storey estates around the city. Bunton {{was said to have}} dreamt of [...] "building a Manhattan-style skyscraper" [...] in Glasgow, hence the use of the steel frame construction system in place of the [...] "system-built" [...] pre-fabricated concrete panel method which had been used for all other tower blocks built in the city up until that point. This would create one of the estate's most significant legacies - steel construction had to be fire-proofed, which meant the use of asbestos, a legacy which would blight the estate in the coming years. Bunton argued for the steel frame in numerous letters to the Glasgow Herald in February 1963, claiming [...] "it is the best material available in the construction field since it brings into active participation an array of <b>steel</b> <b>erectors,</b> and the resources of an industry which is at present only working at one-third of its capacity", thus suggesting that local politics (primarily lobbying from Glasgow's underworked steel fabrication industries) had shaped the design of the buildings in other ways.|$|R
40|$|The {{widespread}} use of wireless communication services {{has resulted in the}} construction of telecommunication towers to hold transmitting devices for cellular phones, personal communication services, and televisions and radio broadcast antennas. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) estimates that at least 75, 000 telecommunication towers have been constructed in the United States, and industry groups indicate that more than 1, 000 telecommunication towers are erected each year [Chiles 1997]. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Public Law 104 - 104) is expected to promote more tower construction to meet the increased demand fow wireless communication services [OSHA 1998]. Telecommunication towers are generally manafactured as sections and constructed onsite by hoisting each section into place and bolting sections together. Some models of shorter towers are self-erecting. For most towers that are constructed onsite, cranes and gin poles attatched to the tower being erected are genetally used to hoist each section into place. A gin pole is used to raise sucessive sections of steel, equipment, or workers into position. This temporaru lifting device uses cables and pulleys to accomodate the length of the next tower section of equipment being installed. The exact number of workers involved in tower construction and maintenance is unknown. Workers are categorized in a variety of occupational subgroups for which employment data are collected. These groups include communications workers, painters, <b>steel</b> <b>erectors,</b> and electrical and electronic equipment repairers. In addition to telecommunication towers, transmitting devices for wireless communication services are often mounted on the roof perimeters of buildings, exposing workers to fall hazards. However, the mounting and maintenance of these devices on buildings require fall protection measures that are not addressed in this document.

40|$|The present {{research}} extends the state-of-the-art {{in understanding the}} important physical phenomena that impact the constructability and behavior of horizontally curved steel I-girder bridges. The steel erection procedure of a horizontally curved and skewed steel I-girder bridge is examined {{through the use of}} a nonlinear finite element model. The behavior of the structure is studied for each stage of steel erection by observations of girder stresses, displacements and reactions. The eccentric application of gravity load resulting from horizontal curvature results in torsional forces being applied to the girder sections of a horizontally curved bridge. Due to the relative torsional flexibility of the steel I-girders, these forces can result in a marked girder rotation quantified in this work as web out-of-plumbness. The {{present research}} quantifies the effect and importance of girder web out-of-plumbness on primary member stress response in steel I-girders, both individually and as part of an assembly. Girder flange stresses and vertical and lateral displacements are presented for single straight and curved beam models and a curved two-girder system model all subject to up to 5 degrees of out-of-plumbness. Through a parametric study the effects of changes to radius or horizontal curvature, girder spacing, cross frame spacing, and web depth on the behavior of the curved two-girder system having initially out-of-plumb webs are investigated. The effects of "inconsistent detailing" - an approach to designing bridge cross frames to mitigate girder web out-of-plumbness - are presented. Specifically, the structural behavior in terms of resulting "locked-in" girder flange stresses and displacements are discussed. The research work reported herein is primarily analytical in nature, employing detailed non linear finite element models to investigate the steel erection and web-plumbness issues associated with horizontally curved steel I-girder bridges. Based on the analytical studies conducted, it is proposed that the effects of web out-of-plumbness need to be specifically considered for the effects on flange stresses in design, as an alternative to the practice of inconsistent detailing. Consideration of these effects during design and conventionally detailing girders and cross frames for the web-plumb position at no-load, in lieu of specifying inconsistent detailing to control web out-of-plumbness, will reduce construction problems that typically result from the practice of inconsistent detailing. However, if inconsistent detailing is employed to mitigate web out-of-plumbness, it must be recognized by bridge designers that this approach has complex effects on "locked-in" stresses and constructability of curved I-girder bridges. These "locked-in" stresses and constructability issues need to be considered by bridge designers and <b>steel</b> <b>erectors,</b> respectively...|$|R
