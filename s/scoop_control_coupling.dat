40|$|This thesis {{recalls the}} {{desirability}} {{of being able to}} apply congestion <b>control</b> <b>coupling</b> to concurrent TCP connections between the same end hosts. We identify challenges that must be overcome to provide practically deployable solutions to this end, chiefly the presence of multi-path routing mechanisms, such as Equal Cost Multi-Path Routing (ECMP) in the network. Additionally, we identify some inherent weaknesses in previous proposals for TCP congestion <b>control</b> <b>coupling.</b> We contribute a novel design for a TCP-in-UDP encapsulation scheme which is able to work around the problems created by multi-path routing, as well as delivering other advantages, which we implement in the FreeBSD kernel.

5000|$|The {{original}} Hydra-Matic {{continued to}} be used in light trucks and other commercial vehicles until 1962. It was subsequently replaced in that role by Chevrolet Division's Powerglide (where it was dubbed [...] "Pow-R-Flow") in the GMC light truck line, and later, in 1966, with the Turbo Hydra-Matic (THM) in GMC light trucks, whose simplified design was much less costly to manufacture. Chevrolet Division's light truck line used the less-than-adequate Powerglide all through the 1960s until Turbo-Hydramatic was made standard in 1969. Cast iron Hydra-Matic production ceased at Willow Run after the 1962 model year, and <b>Controlled</b> <b>Coupling</b> Hydramatic ceased in early 1964, allowing retooling time for the Turbo Hydra-Matic 400, which debuted in the 1964 Cadillac models in mid-year, with Pontiac Division's Star Chief and Bonneville models being the last to use the <b>Controlled</b> <b>Coupling</b> Hydramatic (Model HM315) of any GM car. 1964 Turbo-Hydramatic production used a selector quadrant similar to Chevrolet's Powerglide in that there was only one [...] "Drive" [...] position and a [...] "Low," [...] although it was a true three-speed unit. This was improved upon for all 1965 models with the [...] "D L2 L1" [...] or [...] "D S L" [...] quadrant, which allowed [...] "dual range" [...] flexibility as did the Dual Range Hydramatic of 1953-1955. It was this version which replaced all Roto Hydramatic and <b>Controlled</b> <b>Coupling</b> Hydramatic models in GM cars in that year, ending twenty-four years of four speed automatic transmission production that obviated the need for a torque converter.

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that maternal recognition of paternally derived fetal antigens occurs during normal pregnancy {{and may be}} beneficial for implantation and maintenance of gestation. Thus, we have investigated the human leukocyte class II DR antigens (HLA-DR), whose role in self and non-self recognition is well known, in women with pre-eclampsia, their partners and in <b>control</b> <b>couples.</b> The HLA-DR antigens were tested in 70 pre-eclamptic primigravidae women and their partners and 70 healthy <b>control</b> <b>couples</b> using the serological Terasaki technique. Our results did not show any particular HLA-DR antigen to be correlated with pre-eclampsia, but a statistically significant increase of only one identifiable HLA-DR antigen, which was presumed to express homozygosity at the HLA-DR locus, in the pre-eclamptic women and their partners: 67. 1 versus 7. 9 % in the <b>control</b> <b>couples</b> (P < 0. 000001). The analysis of HLA-DR compatibility between pre-eclamptic women and their partners showed a statistically highly significant increase of the female-to-male compatibility (P = 0. 0003) and a lower but significant male-to-female compatibility in comparison with controls (P = 0. 014). From our results, it emerges that HLA-DR homozygosity and reduced antigenic disparity seem to be associated to a major risk for pre-eclampsia, which consequently {{appears to be a}} 'couple's disease'...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{assess the}} {{temporal}} trend in multiple sclerosis (MS) onset {{during the last}} 50 years in Sardinia, Italy. METHODS: The authors used a cohort study to assess age at onset in 1, 513 MS patients at the MS clinic in Cagliari, all born and living in Sardinia. They also assessed age at onset in 41 pairs of familial patients from two generations and 78 pairs of affected sibs. Each familial couple was paired with three couples of sporadic patients born {{in the same year}} as the familial ones. The time interval between the first symptoms and diagnosis was analyzed in first and second-diagnosed patients from both familial and <b>control</b> <b>couples.</b> RESULTS: Mean age at onset progressively decreased from the most remote to the most recent decade of birth (log-rank test 778. 27, p < 0. 0001), being 41 years in the former decade and 22 years in the latter. A genetic influence was ruled out, because the younger member of familial patients coming from two generations had onset 14. 0 years earlier than the older one (p < 0. 0001), as in the paired <b>control</b> <b>couples</b> (11. 6 years, p < 0. 0001). Moreover, mean onset in younger sibs was 3. 4 years earlier than in older ones (p = 0. 01), similar to that of <b>control</b> <b>couples</b> (4. 1 years, p < 0. 0001). CONCLUSION: Age at onset decreases progressively from older to younger generations in Sardinian MS patients.

40|$|Variant alleles of the mannose binding lectin (MBL) gene are {{associated}} with increased susceptibility to infection and polymorphisms of tumour necrosis factor and lymphotoxin alpha genes (TNF, LTA) {{are associated}} with increased severity of infection. Studies have associated recurrent miscarriage with low serum mannose binding lectin concentrations and premature membrane rupture and preterm delivery with elevated maternal and fetal levels of TNF and the TNF (− 308) polymorphism. In this study the frequencies of variant MBL, TNF and LTA alleles in 76 Caucasian couples with idiopathic recurrent miscarriage were compared with those in 69 Caucasian <b>control</b> <b>couples</b> with no history of miscarriage {{and at least one}} previous live birth. A new assay based on hybridization to immobilized sequence-specific oligonucleotides (SSO) was used to rapidly detect nine MBL, two TNF and two LTA sequence variants. The assay genotyped all the structural and promoter MBL variants known to influence serum MBL concentrations. This assay was more reliable than restriction digestion or nested allele-specific PCR for the structural variants at codon 54 or 52, respectively. Reliability for codon 57 alleles was not assessed because of the low frequency in this population. The MBL haplotype frequencies in antenatal controls were similar to those reported in other control populations. The frequencies of structural variant MBL genes and of low, medium and high MBL level haplotypes were similar in the recurrent miscarriage and <b>control</b> <b>couples.</b> The TNF and LTA haplotype frequencies were similar in the recurrent miscarriage and <b>control</b> <b>couples.</b> In this carefully defined population no association has been found between recurrent miscarriage and variant alleles of the MBL, TNF or LTA genes...|$|R
