They dominate these grinding applications because greater stress intensity {{can be delivered}} in <b>stirred</b> <b>mills</b> and they can achieve better energy efﬁciency than ball mills in ﬁne and ultra-ﬁne grinding. Investigations were conducted on whether the greater performance of <b>stirred</b> <b>mills</b> over ball mills in ﬁne grinding can be extended to coarse grinding applications. Four different laboratory ball <b>mills</b> and <b>stirred</b> <b>mills</b> have been tested to grind seven ore samples with feed sizes ranging from 3. 35 mm to 150 lm.

50|$|Tower mills, {{often called}} {{vertical}} <b>mills,</b> <b>stirred</b> <b>mills</b> or regrind mills, are {{a more efficient}} means of grinding material at smaller particle sizes, {{and can be used}} after ball mills in a grinding process. Like ball mills, grinding (steel) balls or pebbles are often added to <b>stirred</b> <b>mills</b> to help grind ore, however these mills contain a large screw mounted vertically to lift and grind material. In tower mills, there is no cascading action as in standard grinding <b>mills.</b> <b>Stirred</b> <b>mills</b> are also common for mixing quicklime (CaO) into a lime slurry.

40|$|Grinding {{plays an}} {{important}} role in many industries and is still poorly understood because of complicated breakage behaviour of particles in the process. The lack of understanding of particle breakage has prevented the development of the fundamental understandings of the grinding process. This work investigated the breakage behaviours of particles under different grinding conditions. Physical experiments and numerical simulations were conducted in two different types of mills: a variable speed impact mill and a horizontal <b>stirred</b> <b>mill.</b> The effects of material characteristics and operation conditions were investigated. For the variable speed impact mill, it is shown that particle shape has a strong effect on the breakage behaviour. The irregular shape particles experience different crack mechanisms comparing with the regular shape particles, leading to the variation in breakage ratio. The breakage ratio increases significantly as the impact energy increases. Multiple impact tests show that the complete breakage can be reached at low impact energy after multiple impactions. Two material properties, resistance to fracture f_mat and threshold fracture energy W_(m,min) which describe the grindability of the materials, can be determined by fitting method. The results show that they are inversely proportional to each other. For the horizontal <b>stirred</b> <b>mill,</b> it is shown that the mill rotation speed plays a crucial role in particle breakage. The relationship between the grinding rate K_p and impact energy E_i in horizontal <b>stirred</b> <b>mill</b> has been analysed and the results show it follows the power law. The study of the relationship between grinding rate K_p and time indicates that the kinetics of the grinding process in horizontal <b>stirred</b> <b>mill</b> is in first order. The effect of increasing of the grinding media size shows a better grinding performance but the cost of power consumption is considerable. The CFD-DEM simulations of particle flow patterns reach an acceptable agreement with experimental results. Therefore, the model can be used to predict the variation of flow patterns of particles in the grinding process in horizontal <b>stirred</b> <b>mill...</b>|$|E

Many ore deposits classified {{in the past as}} “untreatable” have been economically extracted enabled by improvements in this technology. Gravity induced stirred mills are widely used in the industry, but the effect of classification above the grinding zone (referred as internal classification zone) is not well understood. The authors have conducted research to develop a process model for the gravity induced <b>stirred</b> <b>mill.</b> An integral part {{of this study is to}} understand and develop a predictive model for the internal classification zone above the grinding region. A rising bed classifier has been designed, and a series of experiments were carried out by varying the slurry solids concentration and flow velocity to replicate the gravity induced <b>stirred</b> <b>mill</b> classification effect. The results show that the internal classification effect is significant when the slurry is dilute and flow velocity in the mill is low. The cut size (d) coarsened from 158  μm to 2040  μm and sharpness of the cut (α) increased from 0. 18 to 0. 84 with a rise in slurry solids concentration (v/v) from 26 % to 46 % and flow velocity from 10  mm/s to 21  mm/s.

40|$|Although stirred mills {{have been}} used widely in the mineral {{processing}} concentrators for fine grinding purposes, till date a standard ore characterisation test is not available for this technology. Advanced process modelling requires ore hardness index and ore specific breakage functions for accurate predictive capability. The Julius Kruttschnitt Mineral Research Centre (JKMRC) has pioneered the initiative to develop a practical ore characterisation test for the fine particles (within <b>stirred</b> <b>mill</b> regime). The JKFBC (JK fine-particle breakage characteriser) was used to develop an index that represents the ore hardness of the <b>stirred</b> <b>mill</b> feed. The index is called <b>Stirred</b> <b>mill</b> index (SM). This index measures the particles hardness and generate a generic tn-family curve (to establish energy base breakage function). Four types of materials were chosen for the test work i. e. Au-Cu ore, limestone, Fe ore and Au ore. The JKFBC test works were carried out by varying the applied vertical load, mill rotational speed and number of revolutions to achieve various levels of energies. The energy regimes chosen in this test work were within the typical operational conditions of the industrial scale gravity induced stirred mills. The test was modified from the original Shi 2 ̆ 7 s test methodology by reducing {{the thickness of the}} particles bed in the mill and specific energy consumption. The volume of the material in the mill is kept constant to avoid the particle density effect. A new t function that incorporates the size effect was used to describe the breakage in the JKFBC. Ore hardness of the fine particles (between 1180 and 53 μm) was quantified through SM. A preliminary tn-t family curves was developed that responds based on the hardness of the samples - SM and energy. Further work in extending this procedure with other types of ores are essential for a more robust model parameters.

These two types of mills present different particle breakage mechanisms and redox environments during grinding. In this study, the effect of regrinding with these two types of mills on the separation of chalcopyrite from pyrite in the cleaner stage was studied. A laboratory rod mill and a laboratory <b>stirred</b> <b>mill</b> were used to regrind rougher flotation concentrates. It was found that chalcopyrite and pyrite exhibited different flotation behavior after regrinding with the rod mill and the <b>stirred</b> <b>mill,</b> resulting in different separability of chalcopyrite from pyrite. The mechanism underpinning this phenomenon was investigated by a range of techniques including dissolved oxygen demand measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS).

40|$|In {{the last}} decade {{there has been an}} {{increase}} in demand for fine grinding due to the depletion of coarse-grained orebodies and an increase of processing fine disseminated minerals and complex orebodies. These ores have provided new challenges in concentrator design because fine and ultra-fine grinding is required to achieve acceptable recovery rates. Therefore, the correct design of a grinding circuit is important for minimizing unit costs and increasing product quality.

Efficient operation can be measured based on cost, metallurgical and energy efficiency of the operation or as {{a combination of the}} three, with energy efficiency becoming increasingly more important in the world and current South African context even more so. With ore bodies becoming more complex and finely disseminated the need for ultra fine grinding to maximise mineral recoveries in PGM concentrating operations by means of mainstream grinding has become more important.

Introduction of new stirred milling technology for mainstream grinding using ceramic media successfully addressed the challenge posed by finely disseminated and complex PGM ore bodies.

40|$|<b>Stirred</b> media <b>milling</b> is a {{prospective}} technology for producing colloidal dispersions {{by means of}} wet grinding process. In the past, many researchers have studied the effects of different operating parameters such as size, shape, nature and quantity of grinding medium, the speed of agitator in grinding chamber, the feed rate of dispersions, etc. in <b>stirred</b> media <b>mills.</b> However, it is still less known how particle sizing which generates valuable information of particle size of the product to interpret, control and optimize the grinding process, {{is influenced by the}} concentration of the dispersion during <b>stirred</b> media <b>milling</b> where particles change their size from micron to colloidal range rapidly. One of the reasons of this lack had been our incapability in the past to study the particle size distribution of dispersions without dilution. The recent advent of acoustic attenuation spectroscopy is known to be capable of studying dispersions without dilution, under real process conditions and on line. The study employs acoustic attenuation spectroscopy to investigate the effects of concentration of dispersions of CaCO 3 on its particle sizing during size reduction process in a <b>stirred</b> media <b>mill</b> (LabStar manufactured by NETZSCH). The dispersions of CaCO 3 at 5 %, 10 %, 20 % and 30 % (m/m) were studied about six hours under a selected set of operating conditions. Contrary to the existing knowledge obtained through other techniques of particle sizing that are based on the principle of dilution, acoustic attenuation spectroscopy shows that, under certain grinding time at given operating conditions, increase in concentration of dispersion results in better grinding results yielding smaller particles. The causes behind the differences in results of acoustic attenuation spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering have been thoroughly investigated.

Media stress intensity analysis developed for high-speed horizontal mills was modified to include the effect of gravitational force in the vertical <b>stirred</b> <b>mills</b> such as the Tower and SAM units. The results suggest that this approach can be successfully applied for both mill types. For a given specific energy input, an optimum stress intensity range existed, for which the finest product was achieved. Finer product and therefore higher milling efficiency was obtained with SAM in the range of operating conditions tested. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{published and}} new experimental {{evidence on the}} effect of the grinding environment on fine (− 10 μm) value mineral recovery in flotation. Reasons for increases in fine value mineral recovery from ores with fully electrochemically inert grinding media are discussed in relation to reduced surface contamination by iron hydroxide emanating from the grinding media. The application of <b>stirred</b> <b>milling</b> technology, which allows the use of fully inert grinding media, to primary grinding applications may lead to increased fine value mineral recovery in flotation rougher applications. It is suggested that the effect of the grinding media, which is important for fine particles and progressively becomes more important as the grind size becomes finer, is principally due to the abrasion mechanism of the minerals with the grinding media in the production of fine particles. Opportunities for research and industry application are discussed. Stephen Gran...|$|R
