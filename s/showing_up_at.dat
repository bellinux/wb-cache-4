5|$|In June 2013, Dimitri {{received}} an Email from his old friend, and former lover, Brooke English. Brooke {{was shocked when}} Dimitri responded by <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her door, {{and told him that}} she thought she'd never see him again. Dimitri revealed that he and Alex had divorced, and that he had not bothered remaining in touch with Edmund's family and had reverted to his reclusive ways, but that Europe was beginning to bore him and her timing couldn't have been better. Upon returning to town, he stopped by his former residence, Wildwind, only to find that the place was empty. Brooke explained that after its last occupant, Caleb Cortlandt, had moved out, Sam and Maddie, Edmund's children, had not bothered to rent the mansion out again. Dimitri told Brooke that, while at Wildwind, he stopped by the mausoleum and made amends to Edmund, who had died in a fire 8 years earlier.|$|E

25|$|USAF Major Lincoln Bond (William Holden) was {{captured}} during the Korean War {{and subjected to}} torture, finally cracking after 14 months and signing a confession used for propaganda. Upon his release, he took a year {{to recover from the}} ordeal before <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the Flight Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base, hoping to return to work as a test pilot. His old buddy, Colonel McKee (Charles McGraw), tries his best for him, but the base commander, Brigadier General Banner (Lloyd Nolan), turns him down because he cannot trust him to be stable. A complication is that the general's secretary and love interest, Connie Mitchell (Virginia Leith), is an old flame. Bond presses for a job and accepts the general's offer of routine flying in support. Banner is a hands-on leader, taking the most dangerous assignments himself.|$|E

500|$|Wheatley {{thought he}} was treated unfairly in New York {{although}} two different coaching staffs had issues with him. [...] He points out double standards that gave him bad feelings in retrospect. [...] In situations where {{he was not the}} only Giant who was overweight or stuck in traffic, he was punished while others were not and those with worse problems such as <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> practice drunk or being cited for D.U.I. were not vilified. [...] Wheatley had the responsibility of driving his brother, Leslie Mongo, to his school that opened at 8:15 and {{thought he was}} the victim of New Jersey traffic in relation to occasionally being late for 9:00a.m. team meetings. [...] Charles Way, by contrast, Wheatley's closest friend on the team and roommate on the road, was nicknamed [...] "Teacher's Pet." ...|$|E
500|$|When he was 12 years old, Brodeur briefly {{intended}} to stop playing hockey, {{after he had}} been removed from his team's lineup for not <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> a game. Following a conversation with his brother Claude, though, he decided to continue playing. When receiving goaltending instructions in his teens, Brodeur was taught a variety of different styles, ranging from butterfly to stand-up, and paid attention to the technique of others playing the position. He attended a camp run by retired Soviet goalie Vladislav Tretiak, who encouraged the use of multiple methods; Brodeur believes that the concept made him [...] "a student of the game." [...] In the 1989–90 season, he made it to the Quebec Major Junior League. While playing with the Saint-Hyacinthe Laser, Brodeur made the QMJHL All-Rookie team in 1989–90 and the QMJHL 2nd All-Star Team in 1991–92. Brodeur was drafted by the New Jersey Devils in the first round (20th overall) in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft.|$|E
500|$|By Roosevelt's inauguration on March 4, 1905, Hay's {{health was}} so bad that both his wife and his friend Henry Adams insisted on his going to Europe, where he could rest and get medical treatment. Presidential doctor Presley Rixey issued a {{statement}} that Hay was suffering from overwork, but in letters the secretary hinted his conviction {{that he did not have}} long to live. An eminent physician in Italy prescribed medicinal baths for Hay's heart condition, and he duly journeyed to Bad Nauheim, near Frankfurt, Germany. Kaiser Wilhelm II was among the monarchs who wrote to Hay asking him to visit, though he declined; Belgian King Leopold II succeeded in seeing him by <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> his hotel, unannounced. Adams suggested that Hay retire while there was still enough life left in him to do so, and that Roosevelt would be delighted to act as his own Secretary of State. Hay jokingly wrote to sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens that [...] "there is nothing the matter with me except old age, the Senate, and one or two other mortal maladies".|$|E

She's still a cancer patient, but she knows that her job is on the line just like {{everyone}} else's. Everyone is working round the clock, <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> every call, and the Chief is acting like a maniacal overlord." [...] Krill also enjoyed Oh's performance as Yang, writing: [...] "Cristina dealing with children is almost laughable – and actually provides a chuckle or two in this tense episode. Miss C thinks she is striking gold by moving to peds, because she {{will be able to do}} all types of surgery, and on little people, which makes the surgery harder, which is of course, better. Things don't turn out as planned, though, when she realizes kids are a little more resilient than their adult counterparts. And then Callie outs her to Arizona – in the she doesn’t really like kids sense of outing." [...] Krill enjoyed Wilson's performance as Bailey, in addition to Dane's, writing: [...] "He wins the best line of the show with 'That’s how I know my job is safe, Yang – I reattach babies arms.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The rivalry {{extended}} {{into the stands}} {{in the second game}} of the Smythe Division final in Edmonton. During the game, trainer Bearcat Murray went into the stands to rescue his son Al, also a trainer for the Flames, and tore ligaments in his leg in the process. [...] Al had gone into the stands in an attempt to retrieve Gary Suter's stick, which had been knocked into the crowd and was being hidden by Oiler fans. [...] Fearing for his son's safety, Bearcat jumped into the fray himself, suffering the injury. While being wheeled into an ambulance, Murray blew kisses for the cameras. [...] The incident caught the attention of a group of fans in Boston, who formed the [...] "Bearcat Murray Fan Club", and began <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the Boston Garden wearing skull caps and oversized moustaches mimicking Murray's looks when the Flames played there. [...] The Flames lost players on the ice during the physical series as well, as Carey Wilson required surgery to remove his spleen after he was [...] "skewered" [...] by Steve Smith, according to Johnson. Suter had his season ended after suffering torn ligaments in his knee following a low hit by Mark Messier.|$|E
500|$|Some groups even named {{themselves}} {{after the}} president or events related to him, the first being the anarcho-punk band Reagan Youth who formed in Queens, New York in 1980 as a tongue-in-cheek reference to the Hitler Youth. The band's theme song was sung in satire as if by a cadre of neo-fascist youth, shouting, [...] "Reagan Youth—Sieg Heil!" [...] In April 1981, 19 days after the attempted assassination of Reagan by John Hinckley, Jr., a skate punk group [...] from Phoenix, Arizona named themselves JFA, short for [...] "Jodie Foster's Army". Jodie Foster had {{been the target of}} an obsession Hinckley had developed since seeing her portrayal of a teen sex worker in the 1976 Martin Scorsese film Taxi Driver. Hinckley eventually attempted to kill the president as a means to impress the actress. Originally performing under the name The Breakers, one of JFA's first songs was about the assassination attempt, describing Hinckley's actions with the line, [...] "Shoot the prez, shoot a cop, secretary too." [...] When Breakers fans adopted that song's title—Jodie Foster's Army—as their own nickname and began <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Breakers gigs with [...] "JFA" [...] written on their clothes, the band decided to changed their name.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the Tupelo Honey {{recording}} sessions, Morrison {{had recorded}} demo tracks in Woodstock {{for an upcoming}} country-and-western album. Some of the tracks planned for Tupelo Honey did appear on the album, [...] but other more traditional country songs like [...] "The Wild Side of Life", [...] "Crying Time" [...] and [...] "Banks of the Ohio" [...] were abandoned. Morrison decided to move from Woodstock when the lease on his house expired and the landlord wanted to move back in. He explained to Richard Williams in Melody Maker that {{the release of the}} documentary film, Woodstock, in 1970 had altered the quaint character of the [...] community: [...] "Everybody and his uncle started <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the bus station, and that was the complete opposite of what it was supposed to be." [...] In April 1971, before he began recording on the planned album, [...] Morrison and his family moved to Marin County, California, where his wife Janet Planet had family living close by. Morrison's guitarist at the time, John Platania, told biographer Steve Turner that Morrison [...] "didn't want to leave, but Janet wanted to move out West. He was manipulated into going." [...] The Morrisons' new home was in a rural setting situated on a hillside close to San Francisco amid redwood trees. With the move, Morrison abandoned the idea of a full country album and exchanged some of the intended material for songs he had written earlier.|$|E
500|$|As the World Trade Organization (WTO) {{negotiations}} collapsed amid protests at {{a summit}} in Seattle, Trump {{appeared on the}} December 5 airing of ABC's This Week. [...] He said that the WTO was not [...] "necessarily fair" [...] to the United States, and argued that [...] "our best, and our smartest, and our brightest" [...] were not being used to negotiate the deal. [...] He renewed his attack on the negotiation skills of Barshefsky, saying that both she and Secretary of Commerce William M. Daley {{did not know how}} to negotiate. Next, Trump embarked on a two-day campaign stop in California, which the media covered extensively. [...] During the stop, Trump held a press conference, appearing with his campaign entourage that included his girlfriend Melania, Roger Stone, and bodyguard Matt Calamari. [...] Aides made hand sanitizer readily available for reporters, presumably due to Trump's alleged germaphobia. [...] The Associated Press (AP) noted that Trump [...] "made little attempt to appear statesman-like" [...] at the press conference with responses that seemed [...] "tailored more to entertain his listeners than establish his credibility." [...] In Burbank, Trump appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno where he attacked Buchanan as [...] "having a love affair with Adolf Hitler" [...] and discussed his upcoming book, The America We Deserve. [...] The Weekly Standard reported that though the release date was only a month away, the book had yet to be written. [...] After the Tonight Show appearance, Trump attended a meeting of one hundred Southern California Reform Party members, to whom he delivered a speech and answered questions. [...] Crowds cheered Trump when he discussed his opposition to NAFTA, but some were offended when he questioned the existence of a Reform Party platform and, after receiving a copy, left it on the podium when he exited. [...] On the final day, Trump visited the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Museum of Tolerance and walked through an exhibit of The Holocaust. [...] He delivered a speech and held another press conference at the museum atrium, where he denounced Buchanan's views on Nazis. [...] Afterwards, Trump boarded his jet for Long Beach. [...] During an on-jet interview, Trump placed his odds of waging a full-scale campaign at [...] "50/50," [...] but [...] "edging closer," [...] believing there to be a [...] "fervor" [...] among the public about his campaign. [...] The AP evaluated the California response as more [...] "warm" [...] than fervent, but described Trump's treatment as that of a [...] "high profile dignitary." [...] At Trump's final event, he spoke at a Tony Robbins motivational conference. [...] Robbins and Trump had made an agreement that would pay Trump $1 million for <b>showing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> ten of Robbins' events. [...] Trump planned to make campaign stops to coincide with Robbins' shows, speculating that he [...] "could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it." [...] At the event, Trump received what the AP called a [...] "moderately enthusiastic applause" [...] after asking the 21,000 people in attendance whether he should run for president. [...] He received a large ovation when he proclaimed, [...] "people want to hear straight talk. We're tired of being bullied by these moron politicians." [...] Overall, The Weekly Standard praised Trump for his candor on the campaign trail.|$|E
