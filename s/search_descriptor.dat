40|$|Abstract: In {{the present}} work, the {{support vector machine}} (SVM) and Adaboost-SVM {{have been used to}} develop a {{classification}} model as a potential screening mechanism for a novel series of 5 -HT 1 A selective ligands. Each compound is represented by calculated structural descriptors that encode topological features. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the stepwise multiple linear regression (Stepwise-MLR) methods have been used to <b>search</b> <b>descriptor</b> space and select the descriptors which are responsible for the inhibitory activity of these compounds. The model containing seven descriptors found by Adaboost-SVM, has showed better predictive capability than the other models. The total accuracy in prediction for the training and test set is 100. 0 % and 95. 0 % for PSO-Adaboost-SVM, 99. 1 % and 92. 5 % for PSO-SVM, 99. 1 % and 82. 5 % for Stepwise-MLR-Adaboost-SVM, 99. 1 % and 77. 5 % for Stepwise-MLR-SVM, respectively.

40|$|State-of-the-art alloys {{for hard}} coating applications, such as TiAlN, {{are known to}} suffer from {{decreased}} hardness during heat treatment in excess of 900  °C due {{to the formation of}} detrimental wurtzite AlN phases. Recent research has shown that multicomponent alloying with additional transition metals (TMs) such as Cr can shift the onset of the phase transformations to higher temperatures, but a search for new alloys is generally time-consuming due to the large number of processes that influence material properties along with the large number of alloy compositions that have to be synthesized. To overcome this difficulty we carry out systematic first-principles calculations aimed at finding potential new multicomponent TM aluminum nitride alloys for advanced hard coating applications. We direct our search towards a specific property, the thermal stability of the coating. In particular, we concentrate on the thermodynamic stability of the cubic B 1 TM–Al–N phase relative to the wurtzite phase, and choose the enthalpy difference between them as our <b>search</b> <b>descriptor.</b> We perform ab initio calculations for all TMs, considered as impurities in AlN, and identify the most promising candidates that may improve the thermal stability. We present arguments that these elements should be targeted in future in-depth studies, theoretical, as well as experimental.

40|$|Introduction The {{purpose to}} {{this work is}} to review {{systematically}} the morphological changes of the nostrils of patients undergoing surgery for correction of cleft lip and identify in the literature the issues involved {{in the evaluation of}} surgical results in this population. Review of Literature A review was conducted, searching for clinical evidence from MEDLINE. The search occurred in January 2012. Selection criteria included original articles and research articles on individual subjects with cleft lip or cleft palate with unilateral nostril anthropometric measurements before and after surgical correction of cleft lip and measurements of soft tissues. There were 1, 343 articles from the <b>search</b> <b>descriptors</b> and free terms. Of these, five articles were selected.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionControlled ovarian {{stimulation}} {{is an essential}} part of in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles. The aim of this process is to permit follicular aspiration of approximately 8 – 10 oocytes. Individual women have different ovarian responses based on their ovarian reserves. Low doses of exogenous follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) may lead to cancelation of an IVF cycle as a result of insufficient response, and high doses may also lead to cancelation due to the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Knowing the patient's ovarian response permits the use of individually tailored doses of gonadotropin, resulting in decreased occurrence of inappropriate ovarian responses. ObjectiveTo conduct a systematic review of antral follicle count (AFC) performance in adjusting the dose of gonadotropins to prevent inadequate responses in IVF cycles. MethodA systematic review was conducted of studies published in the last 13 years that appraised AFC performance in adjusting the dose of gonadotropins to prevent inadequate responses in IVF cycles. The databases consulted were Medline, LILACS, SciELO and Pubmed. <b>Search</b> <b>descriptors</b> were “antral follicle count” and “ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome”.

40|$|Introduction: Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PaH) are {{a group of}} semi-volatile organic compounds composed of 2 or more aromatic rings, generated during incomplete combustion of organic matter. These compounds have been considered as major air pollutants, and also, {{there is evidence of}} potential mutagenic and carcinogenic effects in some of them. One of the most important sources of these compounds is industry, and particularly, in processes such as aluminium or coke production, waste incineration and petrochemical and oil reining. This last process {{is the subject of this}} article, whose aim is to review the health effects in persons potentially exposed to PAH generated during petroleum reining. Methods: a descriptive review of the available literature was performed, in which PubMed was used as an information source. The following <b>search</b> <b>descriptors</b> were used: refinery, PaH, health, health impact assessment, air pollutants and environmental, as well as their translations in Spanish. Results: eleven articles were included, and most of them correspond to epidemiological studies in which a high incidence of cancer is reported. Conclusions: The reviewed studies concur that there is a signiicant relationship between the presence of oil reineries and the increase of adverse health effects of workers and people living in areas that are close to these industries, particularly, respiratory diseases and cancer. However, it is important to develop studies that simultaneously evaluate the effects on human health and the concentration of these substances in the environment, in order to establish a more direct relationship between the 2 variables...|$|R

No descriptor dominated over the rest and the best accuracy per landmark was strongly distributed among 3 of the 6 algorithms evaluated.

To tackle the locally optimal descriptor learning caused by imprecise geographical segmentation, we further iterate above phrases incorporating the feedback of an “entropy ” based descriptor compactness into a prior distribution to constrain the Gaussian mixture modeling. Consequently, when entering a specific geographical region, the codebook in the mobile device is downstream adapted, which ensures efficient extraction of compact descriptors, its low bit rate transmission, as well as promising discrimination ability.
