5|$|Elemental {{tellurium}} is {{not considered}} particularly toxic; two grams of <b>sodium</b> <b>tellurate,</b> if administered, can be lethal. People exposed to small amounts of airborne tellurium exude a foul and persistent garlic-like odour. Tellurium dioxide {{has been used to}} treat seborrhoeic dermatitis; other tellurium compounds were used as antimicrobial agents before the development of antibiotics. In the future, such compounds may need to be substituted for antibiotics that have become ineffective due to bacterial resistance.|$|E

Many compounds with a stoichiometry that suggests the presence of a metatellurate ion actually contain polymeric anions containing 6-coordinate tellurium(VI), for example <b>sodium</b> <b>tellurate,</b> Na2TeO4 which contains octahedral tellurium centers sharing edges.|$|E

However, information about the biological and toxicological activities of Te in plants and animals is limited. Although Te {{is expected to be}} metabolized in organisms via the same pathway as sulfur and selenium (Se), no precise metabolic pathways are known in organisms, particularly in plants. To reveal the metabolic pathway of Te in plants, garlic, a well-known Se accumulator, was chosen as the model plant. Garlic was hydroponically cultivated and exposed to <b>sodium</b> <b>tellurate,</b> and Te-containing metabolites in the water extract of garlic leaves were identified using HPLC coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) or electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS-MS). At least three Te-containing metabolites were detected using HPLC-ICP-MS, and two of them were subjected to HPLC-ESI-MS-MS for identification. The MS spectra obtained by ESI-MS-MS indicated that the metabolite was Te-methyltellurocysteine oxide (MeTeCysO). Then, MeTeCysO was chemically synthesized and its chromatographic behavior matched with that of the Te-containing metabolite in garlic. The other was assigned as cysteine S-methyltellurosulfide. These results suggest that garlic can assimilate tellurate, an inorganic Te compound, and tellurate is transformed into a Te-containing amino acid, the so-called telluroamino acid. This is the first report addressing that telluroamino acid is de novo synthesized in a higher plant. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|E
40|$|Two new sodium uranyl tellurites and two new <b>sodium</b> uranyl <b>tellurates</b> {{have been}} {{synthesized}} from high-temperature/high-pressure conditions and structurally characterized. We demonstrated that crystalline phases, forming in a Na–U–Te system under extreme conditions, appear to favorably have non-centrosymmetric structures. Three {{out of four}} novel uranyl tellurium compounds, Na[(UO 2) TeIV 2 O 5 (OH) ], Na 2 [(UO 2) (TeVI 2 O 8) ], and Na 2 [(UO 2) TeVIO 5], crystallize in non-centrosymmetric space groups. The crystal structure of Na[(UO 2) TeIV 2 O 5 (OH) ] is based on two-dimensional [UO 2 Te 2 O 5 (OH) ]− corrugated sheets, which are charge balanced by guest Na+ cations. The structure of Na 2 [(UO 2) TeVI 2 O 8] is constructed from [(UO 2) 2 Te 2 O 8] 2 + anionic layers composed of UO 7 pentagonal bipyramids and TeO 6 octahedra. Na 2 [(UO 2) (TeVIO 5) ] is {{a new type of}} three-dimensional anionic open framework built from the interconnection of UO 7 pentagonal bipyramids and TeO 6 octahedra with different types of interlacing channels within the U–Te anionic framework. Na[(UO 2) TeIV 6 O 13 (OH) ], as the only centrosymmetric compound isolated in the Na–U–Te family, is crystallized in space group Pa 3 ̅, and its structure is highly related to that of cliffordite (UO 2 (Te 3 O 7)), which is composed from UO 8 hexagonal bipyramids and TeO 5 square pyramids. The vibrational modes associated with U–O, TeIV–O, and TeVI–O bonds are discussed, and the Raman spectra of the four compounds are characterized for signature bands...|$|R
