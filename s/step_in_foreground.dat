40|$|An {{interest}} {{topic in}} image processing and image interpretation {{is the development}} of methods to incorporate additional a-priori information into the unambiguous interpretation of objects. It is attractive because processes are needed which reduce ambiguity and noise, and finally select the most credible mappings of the objects to the set of interpreations. This paper presents a general approach to descibe and design relaxation processes. The approach is suitable for deterministic processes as well as stochastic processes. The developed approach is based on a definition of the relaxation process as a technique with three steps: the initialization, the updating, and the evaluation. Thereby, investigations of the updating <b>step</b> are <b>in</b> <b>foreground.</b> It is shown that a relaxation operator, which is essential for the relaxation process, can be defined at least by two characteristic functions, the compatibility function and the support function. The described approach is illustrated by an exam [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Detecting the {{boundaries}} of objects is a key <b>step</b> <b>in</b> separating <b>foreground</b> objects from the background, which is useful for robotics and computer vision applications, such as object detection, recognition, and tracking. We propose a new method for detecting object boundaries using planar laser scanners (LIDARs) and, optionally, co-registered imagery. We formulate boundary detection as a classification problem, in which we estimate whether a boundary exists in the gap between two consecutive range measurements. Features derived from the LIDAR and imagery are used to train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to label pairs of range measurements as boundary or non-boundary. We compare this approach to an existing boundary detection algorithm that uses dynamically adjusted thresholds. Experiments show that the new method performs better even when only LIDAR features are used, and additional improvement occurs when image-based features are included, too. The new algorithm performs better on difficult boundary cases, such as obliquely viewed objects...|$|R
2500|$|All {{three large}} {{compositions}} show the banquet {{taking place in}} the open air or a loggia with a grand architectural setting but with the sky visible, and include a raised terrace closing off the back of the pictorial space. In the Palazzo Labia and Arkhangelskoye paintings (and the Paris and London modelli) there are <b>steps</b> <b>in</b> the <b>foreground</b> leading up to the dining table; although the Melbourne painting lacks these steps, the pattern of the marble floor gives a similar visual effect. [...] Only the two or three main figures are seated, but various attendants stand around them. [...] All the compositions show a clear debt to the grandly theatrical feast paintings of Paolo Veronese, nearly a century earlier, such as The Wedding at Cana (1563, Louvre) and The Feast in the House of Levi (1573, Accademia, Venice). [...] Venetian taste approved of such explicit reference to the city's artistic tradition. [...] In the Palazzo Labia the frescos were designed in conjunction with a scheme of trompe l'oeil architecture by Gerolamo Mengozzi Colonna embracing the whole space. [...] The frescos come almost down to the floor, so that the steps bring the main scene up to a height where they could be seen across a crowded room.|$|R
