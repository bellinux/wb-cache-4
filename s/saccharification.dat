25|$|The basic {{steps for}} {{large-scale}} production of ethanol are: microbial (yeast) fermentation of sugars, distillation, dehydration (requirements vary, see Ethanol fuel mixtures, below), and denaturing (optional). Prior to fermentation, some crops require <b>saccharification</b> or hydrolysis of carbohydrates such as cellulose and starch into sugars. <b>Saccharification</b> of cellulose is called cellulolysis (see cellulosic ethanol).

5000|$|Hydrolysis ( [...] ; [...] ) {{usually means}} the {{cleavage}} of chemical bonds {{by the addition}} of water. When a carbohydrate is broken into its component sugar molecules by hydrolysis (e.g. sucrose being broken down into glucose and fructose), this is termed <b>saccharification.</b> Generally, hydrolysis or <b>saccharification</b> {{is a step in the}} degradation of a substance OR in the language of chemistry [...] "The reaction of cation and anion or both with water molecule due to which pH is altered, cleavage of H-O bond in hydrolysis takes place." ...|$|E
50|$|Nonhydrolyzed inulin {{can also}} be {{directly}} converted to ethanol in a simultaneous <b>saccharification</b> and fermentation process, which may have great potential for converting crops high in inulin into ethanol for fuel.|$|E
50|$|Beer is an {{alcoholic}} drink {{produced by the}} <b>saccharification</b> of starch and fermentation of the resulting sugar. The starch and <b>saccharification</b> enzymes are often derived from malted cereal grains, most commonly malted barley and malted wheat. Most beer is also flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The preparation of beer is called brewing. Beer is the world's most widely consumed alcoholic drink, and is the third-most popular drink overall, after water and tea. It is thought {{by some to be}} the oldest fermented drink.|$|E

5000|$|Kōji production. kōjikin, or koji mold spores, are {{cultivated}} {{onto the}} material to form koji mold which creates enzymes as it grows. The enzymes break starch molecules down into sugar molecules that can be fermented, a process called <b>saccharification.</b>|$|E
50|$|Tornesch has a {{place in}} {{biochemical}} history from the wood <b>saccharification</b> process developed by Scholler, also known at the Scholler-Tornesch process. The first factory to use the process was built in Tornesch. This early work {{was part of the}} development of biofuel such as cellulosic ethanol.|$|E
50|$|Chinese liquor, {{which has}} been made for over 5000 years, is {{characterized}} by a double semisolid-state fermentation using fungi as the main microbial starter for the <b>saccharification.</b> This is a typical feature of liquors produced in the Far East. The brewing of Chinese baijiu mainly uses grain except for a few that use fruit.|$|E
50|$|Unlike in the {{production}} of Japanese sake, <b>saccharification</b> and fermentation usually happen in the same mash concurrently, as the seed mash and starter act on the cooked rice. The mixture is then left to mature in earthenware jars for a length of time from several months to several decades before being bottled and sold.|$|E
50|$|The α-amylase rest is {{also known}} as the <b>saccharification</b> rest, because during this rest the α-amylase breaks down the {{starches}} from the inside, and starts cutting off links of glucose one to four glucose molecules in length. The longer glucose chains, sometimes called dextrins or maltodextrins, along with the remaining branched chains, give body and fullness to the beer.|$|E
5000|$|In 1889, John Montgomerie of Scotland filed a U.S. patent application, {{which was}} granted in 1890. This patent {{asserted}} a prior patent existed in England dated 1886. The U.S. patent, titled [...] "Making Malted Bread", included {{instructions for the}} manufacture of digestive biscuits. Montgomerie claimed this <b>saccharification</b> process would make [...] "nourishing food for people of weak digestion".|$|E
50|$|Similar to {{ultrasonic}} cleaning, biological cells including {{bacteria can}} be disintegrated. High power ultrasound produces cavitation that facilitates particle disintegration or reactions. This has uses in biological science for analytical or chemical purposes (sonication and sonoporation) and in killing bacteria in sewage. High power ultrasound can disintegrate corn slurry and enhance liquefaction and <b>saccharification</b> for higher ethanol yield in dry corn milling plants.|$|E

Montgomerie claimed a novel <b>saccharification</b> process which involved warming {{a portion of}} dough mixed with diastatic malt extract to an appropriate mash temperature and holding it for a time so the extract's enzymes would pre-digest some of the starch.|$|E
50|$|Often in the {{production}} of Hongqu rice wine, both Hongqu and Xiaoqu are utilized. Studies have revealed that Monascus species show strong gluco-amylase activity, but poor proteolytic and lipolytic enzyme production. Also the fermentative yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was mostly absent from Hongqu starters but present in Xiaoqu. Thus Hongqu is used only to provide red pigmentation and <b>saccharification</b> and as such, they should generally be used in conjunction with another starter with high fermentative capability.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} general types of mirin. The first is hon mirin (literally: true mirin), which {{contains}} approximately 14% alcohol and {{is produced by}} a forty- to sixty-day mashing (<b>saccharification)</b> process. The second is shio mirin, which contains alcohol as low as 1.5% to avoid alcohol tax. The third is shin mirin (literally: new mirin), or mirin-fu chomiryo (literally: mirin-like seasoning), which contains less than 1% alcohol yet retains the same flavor.|$|E
5000|$|In beer or whiskey production, grains, such as corn, are put {{though a}} mashing process, where grain is ground {{and added to}} hot water. The starch in the grains {{undergoes}} <b>saccharification</b> by enzymes, turning the starch into sugars that are released into the water. The water {{is removed from the}} grain, and becomes wort for brewing. The remaining grain, called [...] "spent grain" [...] for the removal of simple sugars and starch, can then be sold as a by-product.|$|E
50|$|The Kōji (麹) molds are a {{group of}} Aspergillus species, notably Aspergillus oryzae, and {{secondarily}} A. sojae, that have been cultured in eastern Asia for many centuries. They are used to ferment a soybean and wheat mixture to make soybean paste and soy sauce. Koji molds break down the starch in rice, barley, sweet potatoes, etc., a process called <b>saccharification,</b> {{in the production of}} sake, shōchū and other distilled spirits. Koji molds are also used in the preparation of Katsuobushi.|$|E
50|$|Brown rice (malt) syrup, {{also known}} as rice syrup or rice malt, is a {{sweetener}} which is rich in compounds categorized as sugars and is derived by culturing cooked rice starch with saccharifying enzymes {{to break down the}} starches, followed by straining off the liquid and reducing it by evaporative heating until the desired consistency is reached. The enzymes used in the <b>saccharification</b> step are supplied by an addition of sprouted barley grains to the rice starch (the traditional method) or by adding bacterial- or fungal-derived purified enzyme isolates (the modern, industrialized method).|$|E
50|$|Cheongju {{is usually}} brewed in winter, between {{the months of}} November and March. Steamed rice mixed with nuruk (fermentation starter) and water is left to ferment for 16 to 25 days, at a {{temperature}} not higher than 14-16 C. During the fermentation process, the rice starch becomes saccharified; the yeast fungi feed on the sugars created by <b>saccharification</b> and produce alcohol. The fermented wine is then filtered with yongsu (a wine strainer), which is dipped into the liquid. The clear wine inside the yongsu is ladled out to make cheongju.|$|E
50|$|The rice-dextrin {{solution}} then {{undergoes a}} further heat-assisted <b>saccharification</b> step involving {{the addition of}} further enzyme isolates, which convert the complex carbohydrates (rice-dextrins) into a solution rich in the simple carbohydrate maltose. The solution is then partially evaporated by boiling, until the final desired water content of the syrup is achieved. Brown rice syrup generated by this process is protein, fibre (hemicellulose) and lipid free and usually consists of 65-85% maltose, 10-15% maltotriose, 5-20% dextrins and only 2-3% glucose. The final carbohydrate mix of brown rice syrups can be controlled and adjusted by the manufacturer.|$|E
50|$|Production of Zhenjiang vinegar {{begins when}} a vinegar pei mixture (wheat bran, rice hull, alcohol {{obtained}} from <b>saccharification</b> of glutinous rice and vinegar seed from a prior batch) is poured into an urn until the urn is half-full. The mixture is kept warm {{for up to}} 3 days in summer and 6 days in winter. At that point, rice hull is added and mixed in once per day until the urn is full. Salt is added and the urn is stored for up to 3 months during which it undergoes an aging process. The vinegar is then leached and the soaking liquid from water-soaked, parched rice is added as a color and flavor enhancer.|$|E
50|$|The enzymes {{used in the}} {{liquefaction}} step {{are usually}} alpha-amylases derived from bacterial or fungal bioreactors (Bacillus species or Aspergillus species are {{the most commonly used}} microbe engines in the bioreactors). These convert starch into dextrins of various molecular sizes and the modified starch end product is usually given an appropriate DE (Dextrose Equivalent) rating to signify the degree of starch conversion and the amount of reducing sugars produced in the process. The enzymes used in the <b>saccharification</b> step are the amylolytic enzyme, beta-amylase (usually derived from Bacillus species) and the debranching enzyme, pullulanase (derived from Aerobacter species). These convert the dextrinised starch into simple carbohydrates (sugars) and lower molecular weight dextrins.|$|E
50|$|The brewery {{may also}} {{separate}} the <b>saccharification</b> and fermentation of the grain, similar to sake. If this is desired, the seed mash is typically not used, since a main mash {{will never be}} produced. Instead, a mash of water, steamed glutinous rice, and other grains is inoculated with rice {{that has already been}} cultivated with the mold Aspergillus oryzae or molds of the Rhizopus genus and certain strains of Lactobacillus. When mixed into the mash, the molds cultivate the mixture and convert the starch in the grains into sugar and lactic acid. This sweet and slightly sour liquid is drained and reserved, while additional water (and sometimes also malt) is added to the mixture. The process is repeated until the grains are exhausted. Yeast is then added to this liquid in order to convert the sugars in the liquid to alcohol.|$|E
50|$|After {{the little}} starter is added, it is allowed around {{two days to}} begin the <b>saccharification,</b> acidification, and {{fermentation}} of the grains. Inoculation with the first starter partially liquifies the steamed grains, which is the signal to add the big starter {{as well as more}} water to form a thick slurry. This slurry is carefully stirred by a brewmaster to aerate and maintain an optimal level of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the mixture, as well as to maintain an even temperature throughout the fermenting mass. The slurry is periodically stirred {{over the course of a}} week. The stirred slurry is then allowed to go through a more thorough fermentation for approximately one month, following which the pH drops to around 3.4 and the alcohol content rises to approximately 15%. This is the seed mash that will be used to brew the main mash.|$|E
50|$|The {{utilization}} of microbial-cultured starches {{to generate a}} fermentation {{has a long history}} in Asian countries, as seen by the large diversity of foods and beverages produced. Brewing alcoholic beverages from grains typically involves the use of sprouted cereal grains that supply natural enzymes to break down carbohydrates, proteins and lipids. The ensuing liquid obtained is fermented by microbes and turned into an alcoholic drink. As the grains used for traditional Asian alcoholic fermentations are raw and unsprouted (read unmalted), the enzymes responsible for the conversion of carbohydrates to fermentable sugars are absent and thus fermentation cannot proceed. Culturing microbes on cereal grains is a time-honoured tradition from Asia and the necessary way around this dilemma, as they exude the enzymes that allow liquefaction and <b>saccharification</b> to occur (up to fifty different enzymes have been isolated from Aspergillus oryzae starters). Their mutualistic symbiosis with fermentative yeast and bacteria initiates the complex saccharification-liquefaction-fermentation process to produce the sought after alcoholic liquid.|$|E
5000|$|Jiahu yielded some of {{the oldest}} Chinese pottery yet found in Neolithic China. Patrick McGovern of the University of Pennsylvania Museum in Philadelphia, {{sometimes}} called the [...] "Indiana Jones" [...] of alcoholic beverages, led {{a team of scientists}} who applied biomarker chemical analysis to pottery jars from Jiahu. They found signature molecules proving alcohol was fermented from rice, honey, grapes, and hawthorn. Researchers hypothesize that this hybrid beverage (a beer, wine, and mead combination) was fermented by the process of mold <b>saccharification,</b> a uniquely Chinese contribution to the art of beverage-making in which several mold species are used to break down the carbohydrates of rice and other grains into simple, fermentable sugars. Specific aromatic herbs and flowers such as chrysanthemum, in addition to tree resins such as China fir, had been added to the hybrid beverages, the researchers found. These aromatic additions, as well as the honey, indicate that fermented beverages with a pleasing aroma and sweet taste were important to the Jiahu people.|$|E
5000|$|Mashing {{converts}} the starches released {{during the}} malting stage into sugars {{that can be}} fermented. The milled grain is mixed with hot water in a large vessel known as a mash tun. In this vessel, the grain and water are mixed {{together to create a}} cereal mash. During the mash, naturally occurring enzymes present in the malt convert the starches (long chain carbohydrates) in the grain into smaller molecules or simple sugars (mono-, di-, and tri-saccharides). This [...] "conversion" [...] is called <b>saccharification.</b> The result of the mashing process is a sugar-rich liquid or [...] "wort", which is then strained through the bottom of the mash tun in a process known as lautering. Prior to lautering, the mash temperature may be raised to about 75 - 78 C (known as a mashout) to free up more starch and reduce mash viscosity. Additional water may be sprinkled on the grains to extract additional sugars (a process known as sparging).|$|E
30|$|Additional file 1 : Figure S 1 {{shows the}} effects of each {{pretreatment}} variable on the <b>saccharification</b> yield. In general, increasing the concentration of ethanol in OS pretreatment reduced the <b>saccharification</b> yield for birch (p-value 0.0061), but not for spruce. The acid catalyst had {{a positive effect on}} the <b>saccharification</b> yield of both OS-pretreated birch and spruce. Particle size did not influence the <b>saccharification</b> yield for pretreated birch, but a reduction from <[*] 4 to <[*] 1  mm had a positive effect on pretreated spruce. The pretreatment time did not seem to affect the <b>saccharification</b> yields significantly. An average <b>saccharification</b> yield of 18 % (20 % with SE) was obtained with OS-pretreated birch, and 6 % (5 % with SE) with spruce.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{maximize}} the glucose concentration produced from enzymatic hydrolysis of tapioca starch. The tapioca starch was enzymatically hydrolyzed using α-amylase from Bacillus lichenformis followed by amyloglucosidase action from Aspergillus niger. Effects of liquefaction temperature (X 1), <b>saccharification</b> temperature (X 2), liquefaction pH (X 3) and <b>saccharification</b> pH (X 4 ¬) were evaluated. 24 full factorial design with 1 replicate and 3 centered point was applied to determine the significant parameters affecting the production of glucose concentration. The range of the factors employed were 60 - 90 ˚C (liquefaction temperature), 40 - 60 ˚C (<b>saccharification</b> temperature), 5 - 7 (liquefaction pH) and 4 - 6 (<b>saccharification</b> pH). The maximum glucose concentration obtained experimentally was 329. 10 g/L. The ANOVA shows that the effects of liquefaction temperature and <b>saccharification</b> pH on glucose production were very significant. The <b>saccharification</b> temperature and liquefaction pH, on the other hand did not influence the glucose production. The optimum liquefaction temperature, <b>saccharification</b> temperature, liquefaction pH and <b>saccharification</b> pH suggested by the design of experiment were 90 ˚C, 60 ˚C, 7 and 6 respectively. From that optimum condition, the maximum glucose concentration of 331. 8 g/L was estimated...|$|E

30|$|Ethanol was {{produced}} from the hydrolysate collected as the water-soluble (WS) portion after hot-compressed water (HCW) treatment of Japanese beech. The process involved <b>saccharification</b> with β-xylosidase followed by isomerization with xylose isomerase and fermentation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Several process schemes {{were compared to}} investigate the effect of process integration of <b>saccharification,</b> isomerization, and fermentation. Higher ethanol yields were obtained for the processes that integrated isomerization and fermentation or <b>saccharification</b> and isomerization. Integration of isomerization and fermentation was effective in converting xylose into ethanol. Similarly, integration of <b>saccharification</b> and isomerization was effective in converting xylooligosaccharides into xylulose. It is presumed that the <b>saccharification</b> reaction toward xylose and the isomerization reaction toward xylulose were linked and therefore each reaction was enhanced.|$|E
30|$|Steam {{pretreatment}} {{is known}} to improve the enzymic <b>saccharification</b> ratio of hardwood and herbaceous biomass [12]. Because only water is used without alkali, acid, or organic solvent in steam treatment, steam treatment was selected as an ecologically friendly pretreatment to improve the enzymic <b>saccharification</b> ratio of β-glucan of WS and WE. The {{aim of this study}} was to verify the improvement in the enzymic <b>saccharification</b> ratio of β-glucan of WS and WE using steam treatment and optimize the conditions of steam treatment and enzymic <b>saccharification.</b>|$|E
40|$|Plant cell walls {{represent}} an abundant, renewable source of biofuel and other useful products. The major bottleneck for the industrial scale-up of their conversion to simple sugars (<b>saccharification),</b> to be subsequently converted by microorganisms into ethanol or other products, is their recalcitrance to enzymatic <b>saccharification.</b> We investigated whether {{the structure of}} pectin that embeds the cellulose-hemicellulose network affects the exposure of cellulose to enzymes and consequently the process of <b>saccharification.</b> Reduction of de-methyl-esterified homogalacturonan (HGA) in Arabidopsis plants through {{the expression of a}} fungal polygalacturonase (PG) or an inhibitor of pectin methylesterase (PMEI) increased the efficiency of enzymatic <b>saccharification.</b> The improved enzymatic <b>saccharification</b> efficiency observed in transformed plants could also reduce the need for acid pretreatment. Similar results were obtained in PG-expressing tobacco plants and in PMEI-expressing wheat plants, indicating that reduction of de-methyl-esterified HGA may be used in crop species to facilitate the process of biomass <b>saccharification...</b>|$|E
