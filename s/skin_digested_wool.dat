40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} skin thickness on the percutaneous penetration and distribution of test compounds with varying physicochemical properties using in vitro systems. Studies were carried out in accordance with OECD guidelines on skin absorption tests. Methods: Percutaneous penetration of caffeine (log P - 0. 01), testosterone (log P 3. 32), propoxur (log P 1. 52) (finite dose in ethanol to water vehicle ratio) and butoxyethanol (log P 0. 83) (undiluted finite dose or as an infinite dose 50 % [v/v] aqueous solution) through skin of varying thicknesses under occluded conditions was measured using flow through cells for 8 - 24 h. Saline (adjusted to pH 7. 4) was used as receptor fluid, with BSA added for studies with testosterone and propoxur. Following exposure, the remaining surface dose was removed by swabbing and the <b>skin</b> <b>digested</b> prior to scintillation counting. Results: The maximum flux of caffeine was increased with decreasing skin thickness, although these differences were found to be non-significant. The presence of caffeine in the skin membrane was not altered by skin thickness. Maximum flux and cumulative dose absorbed of testosterone and butoxyethanol (in both finite and infinite doses) were markedly reduced with full thickness (about 1 mm thick) skin compared with split thickness skin (about 0. 5 mm). Maximum flux of propoxur (dissolved in 60 % ethanol) was clearly higher through skin of 0. 71 mm than through skin of 1. 36 mm, but no difference was found between 0. 56 and 0. 71 mm. The proportion of propoxur present in the membrane after 24 h increased significantly over the complete range of thicknesses tested (0. 56 - 1. 36 mm). Conclusions: A complex relationship exists between skin thickness, lipophilicity and percutaneous penetration and distribution. This has implications for risk assessment studies and for the validation of models with data from different sources. © Springer-Verlag 2006...|$|R

Due to its fragile structure, skin can be easily damaged by heat, chemicals, traumatic injuries and diseases. An autologous bilayered human skin equivalent, MyDermTM, was engineered to provide a living skin substitute to treat critical skin loss. However, one of the disadvantages of living skin substitute is its short shelf-life, hence limiting its distribution worldwide. The aim of this study was to evaluate the shelf-life of MyDermTM through assessment of cell morphology, cell viability, population doubling time and functional gene expression levels before transplantation. <b>Skin</b> samples were <b>digested</b> with 0. 6 % Collagenase Type I followed by epithelial cells dissociation with TrypLE Select. Dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes were culture-expanded to obtain sufficient cells for MyDermTM construction. MyDermTM was constructed with plasma-fibrin as temporary biomaterial and evaluated at 0, 24, 48 and 72 hours after storage at 4 uC for its shelf-life determination. The morphology of skin cells derived from MyDermTM remained unchanged across storage times.

40|$|I. Histologica! {{studies of}} calf skin In {{the case of}} tanning of leather and manufaeturing of gelatin, the skin always must be soaked in lime solution. Then the tissues and organs in the skin will {{make a lot of}} morphologically {{remarkable}} changes. Accordingly, in th first place the writer has observed minutely the tissues and organs of the backskin of the Holstein calf. The principal results obtained are as follows : 1. There was no great difference between the skin of the Holstein species and that of others. The former was composed of epidermis, corium and subcutaneous tissue that existed in animals skin in general. 2. The lucidum layer on that epidermis of the back skin, the appearance of which had not been reported, was discovered in this reserch. 3. The papillate layer of calf skin, occupying 45 ^ of all skin thickness, was comparatively thicker than that of the matured cattle skin, -while the reticular layer of calf skin was relatively thin. It was recognized distinctly that the sweat gland and the hair of calf skin were inferior in development to those of the matured cattle skin. 4. There was a little difference between the type of. collagen fibre in the papillate layer ani that in the reticular layer. The rcil form of the so-called grain layer was morphologically not yet clearly recognized. In the; collagen fibre, the kittsubstance was recognized. 5. In the case of the elastic fibre, it was picked up ani left alone for a long time, special striped figures similar to micula emerged {{in the center of the}} elastic fibre. From a distributing point of view, it was considered that there were twojtypes in the elastic fibre. II. On the change of the calf skin during the process of liming It was researched how the tissue of t'le skin suffered changes when it was soaked in the lime solution. The results are as follows : 1. When the raw skin was soaked in the saturate! solution of lime, every cellular element of skin took various forms to be dissolved, and most of them vanished within 72 hours. The cells of sweat glands and arectorpili muscles were the earliest, and every call in epidermis the next and the cell, in the hair follicle the last to be solved. 2. The keratin substance which composed the epidermis was dissolved in the lime solution. But layers in the epidermis separated not individually from one another, but together from the part of the corium. In this case the internal part of the epidermis melted and became one membrane-like plate. 3. The kittsubstance amon 3 the tissues Wire dissolved early, and tissues came to be in isolated states. When this state was over the remaining tissues (collagen fibres) swelled and occupied the space which was produced by the separation. 4. The collagen fibres began to swvell immediately after soaking, an 1 increased the degree of expansion as time passed, but began to separate from one another after about 72 hours owing to the dissolution of kittsubstanca. At the same time the fine fibres also begin to swell ani continued to separate from one another for about 7 days. Afterwards the spaces were not recognized because of the swelling. ^The collagen fibres in papillate layers was earlier in separation and expansion than those in reticular layers. 5. The elastic fibres swelled little by little, and the changes in the form were not recognized so clearly. 6. Some of the cells of the sebaceous gland made little change by lime soaking, except the nuclear change by lims soaking, but the nucleus in those cells made a change of form or was dissolved. It was not possible for the cytoplasma of the cells in raw skin to be stained by acid fuchsin, but they -were stained when soaked in lime solution. 7. The medulla of hairs did not make so much of a chage as others did, but the cells surrounding to support the hairs ･were dissolved, and so the hairs were isolated from one another into a floating condition. Moreover, this floating condition was thought to be enlarged by the spaces of sweat glands. Nevertheless, the hair became fixed by the pressure of the swelled collagen fibre because of the long soaking in the lime solution. 8. According to the facts mentioned above, it was thought best to unhair, after the skin were soaked for 5 or 8 days in lime solution at 18 °C. In comparison with various former theories of unhairing, it was proved that the chief cause of unhairing was the change in the form, produced by collapse of the tissue. III, On the change of fixed calf skin during the process of liming 1. Every tissue and organ in the skin, when it was fixed with formalin, stood against the lime action, and the resistance made a great difference in degree according to the variety of the tissue. 2. It took a long time for the cellular substance of skin to make changes, and it took about 30 days from the day on which it began to show the beginning of change to the dissolution, and each of the processes of change was not equal to each other. It became hard from staining on the fifteenth day or so after being soaked in lime solution. 3. The state of separation of the collagen fibre, from between the epidermis and the corium and from the corium was unsettled and indefinite. Especially the collagen fibres in the reticular layer was indefinite in separation. 4. The kittsubstance in every tissue and organ of the fixed skin grew strong against the lime solution. The floating condition of the collagen fibre and the hair was extremely rarely seen. The suitable time for unhairing cannot be determined, and the complete dehairing does not take place. IV. On the change of <b>skin</b> <b>digested</b> by trypsin 1. Being digested with trypsin, the skin lost the elastic fibres chiefly. That is to say, the fine elastic fibre which was complicated around every tissue and organ in the papillate layer began to vanish at first, and then gradually the large bundles of the elastic fibre in the reticular layer and the telasubcutanea were broken. All the elastic fibres disappeared within 20 hours. * 2. Being digested with the trypsin for. 20 hours, the collagen fibre swelled a little, but remarkable changes were not seen in from. The tissue, composed of keratin, seemed to be denaturated, but no great change was recognized in form. V. Histochemical studies on the reaction in the skin treated by lime solution 1. The collagen fibre degenerated and presented reaction of acidity or neutrality by soaking the raw skin in lime solution. In the case of treating the collagen fibre with silver nitrate, there appeared little dots in stripes. 2. The elastic fibre presented the basic character. That is the elastic fibre combined with lime, formed the protein base, and therefore presented remarkable reactions to the special pigments and was stained better than in the case of raw skin. Silver grains were not recognized in the place Where the elastic fibre existed. 3. The epidermistic tissue (including epidermis) also presented basic character by liming. 4 - The contents of the sebum cutaneum in the sebaceous gland are very complicated, and the reaction by lime solution is not always equal. It was considered that the sebum cutaneum seldom saponifies. The effect of taking fat away by liming was considered to be chiefly in breaking the supporting tissue...|$|R
40|$|MSc (Occupational Hygiene), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 In {{occupational}} {{settings where}} rhodium is produced or used, {{such as the}} mining industry, refineries and catalytic industries, workers {{are at risk of}} being dermally exposed to this metal in either the metallic form or its salt compounds. A considerable amount of contradictory literature has been published with regard to the sensitising abilities of rhodium and no published information is available on the occupational dermal exposure of rhodium as well as its ability to permeate through the skin. Previous studies conducted on the in vitro permeation of metals, such as nickel, cobalt and chromium, have indicated that certain metals undergo oxidation in the presence of sweat and form ions which are able to permeate through skin. For some metals, this ionisation takes place more rapidly in an acidic environment and a decrease in the environmental pH would cause an increase in the release of ions from those metals. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether rhodium in the form of rhodium trichloride (RhCl 3) would be able to permeate through the skin in vitro, as well as to determine whether any differences exist between the in vitro permeation of rhodium at a pH of 4. 5 and a pH of 6. 5. Methods: Full thickness abdominal skin was obtained as biological waste after surgery from Caucasian females ranging between 39 and 42 years of age. The Franz diffusion cell method was used in which the experimental cells contained synthetic sweat with RhCl 3 and the blanks did not contain any RhCl 3 in the donor compartment. All of the cells contained a physiological receptor solution in the receptor compartment. At intervals of 8, 12 and 24 hours, 2 ml of the receptor solution were removed for analysis. The receptor compartment was rinsed with 2 ml receptor solution which was also removed for analysis and 2 ml of fresh receptor solution was added to the compartment. After 24 hours, the receptor and donor solution was removed respectively for analysis and the skin was removed for digestion, prior to analysis. The mass of rhodium in the receptor solutions were determined using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry. The donor solutions and <b>digested</b> <b>skin</b> solutions were analysed using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry. Results: At both pH values of 4. 5 and 6. 5, rhodium was able to permeate through the skin with a cumulative increase in permeation over prolonged exposure time. After 8, 12 and 24 hours, the amount of rhodium that permeated through the skin was higher at pH 4. 5 than for pH 6. 5. After 12 hours, the permeation of rhodium was statistically significantly higher for pH 4. 5 than for pH 6. 5 (p = 0. 02). At both pH values, the percentage of rhodium that accumulated in the skin was higher than the percentage of rhodium that diffused through the skin and the lag time was less than six hours. Conclusion: At both pH values of 4. 5 and 6. 5, rhodium was able to permeate through the skin. A decrease in the pH of synthetic sweat led to an increase in the permeation of rhodium and it is recommended that future in vitro permeation studies be conducted at a pH of 4. 5, as the skin surface pH of workers are generally considered to be below 5. A higher percentage of rhodium was retained in the skin than the percentage that diffused through, indicating the ability of rhodium to accumulate in the skin, from where it may exert health effects, such as sensitisation.

40|$|PhD (Occupational Hygiene), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Background: Platinum group metal (PGM) {{mining and}} {{refining}} {{is a large}} constituent of the mining sector of South Africa and contributes significantly to the gross domestic product. The PGMs include the rare metals platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), rhodium (Rh), ruthenium (Ru), iridium (Ir) and osmium (Os). During the refining process workers are potentially exposed to various chemical forms of the PGMs via the respiratory and dermal exposure routes. Historically, emphasis has been on respiratory exposure while the extent of skin exposure is still unknown. Among the different forms of PGMs, the salts are potential sensitisers, with platinum being a known respiratory sensitiser. Workers occupationally exposed to platinum and rhodium have reported respiratory as well as skin symptoms. However, it is unknown if these metals in the salt form are permeable through human skin, and whether dermal exposure could contribute to sensitisation. Evidence regarding differences between African and Caucasian skin anatomy and structure, as well as permeation through skin is contradictory, and no information is available on metal permeation through African skin. The in vitro diffusion method has been utilised successfully in occupational toxicology to demonstrate that metals such as chromium, cobalt and nickel, to name a few, permeate through human skin. The permeability of platinum and rhodium has not been investigated previously. Aims and objectives: The research aim was to obtain insight into the permeability of platinum and rhodium through intact human skin and to provide information needed to determine the potential health risk following dermal exposure to these metals. The specific objectives included: (i) to critically review the in vitro diffusion method {{that is used to}} determine the permeability of metals through human skin, (ii) to investigate the permeation of potassium tetrachloroplatinate (K 2 PtCl 4) and rhodium chloride (RhCl 3) as representative PGM salts through intact human skin over a 24 -hour period, (iii) to evaluate the difference in permeability of platinum and rhodium through intact human skin, (iv) to evaluate the difference in permeability of platinum through intact African and Caucasian human skin. Methods: Abdominal skin obtained after cosmetic procedures was obtained from five female Caucasian and three female African donors between the ages of 28 and 52 with ethical approval from the North-West University. Full thickness skin tissue was mounted in a vertical Franz diffusion cell. Skin integrity was tested by measuring the electrical resistance across the skin before and after conclusion of the experiments, using a Tinsley LCR Data bridge Model 6401. The donor solution of 32. 46 mg K 2 PtCl 4 in 50 ml of synthetic sweat (pH 6. 5), and 43. 15 mg RhCl 3 in 50 ml of synthetic sweat (pH 6. 5) was prepared. The donor solution was applied to the stratum corneum side of the skin and physiological receptor solution (pH 7. 35) was added to the receptor compartment. The concentration of the metals in the receptor solution was determined by high resolution inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry after extraction at various intervals during the 24 hours of the study. After completion of the study, the skin was rinsed four times to remove any platinum or rhodium remaining on the skin surface. The <b>skin</b> was <b>digested</b> using hydrogen peroxide, nitric acid and hydrochloric acid during different steps to determine the mass of the metals remaining in the skin by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry. Results: The comparison of published in vitro skin permeation studies involving metals is impeded by the variations in the experimental design and dissimilarity in the reporting of results. Differences in experimental design included, most noticeably, the use of various donor and receptor solutions, different temperatures wherein the receptor compartment was placed, differences in skin thickness and variations in exposed skin surface areas. The metals considered in the review, namely chromium, cobalt, gold, lead, mercury, nickel, platinum, rhodium and silver, permeate through intact human skin under physiological conditions. Large variations in the permeability results were observed, with the notable differences in methodology as the probable reason. Results obtained from the in vitro experiments indicate that platinum and rhodium permeated through intact Caucasian skin with flux values of 0. 12 and 0. 05 ng/cm 2 /h, respectively. The cumulative mass of platinum (2. 57 ng/cm 2) that permeated after 24 hours of exposure was statistically significantly (p = 0. 016) higher than rhodium permeation (1. 11 ng/cm 2). The mass of platinum (1 459. 47 ng/cm 2) retained in the skin after 24 hours of exposure was statistically significantly (p < 0. 001) higher than rhodium retention (757. 04 ng/cm 2). The comparison of permeability between two different racial groups indicates that platinum permeated through the skin of both racial groups with the flux through African skin found as 1. 93 ng/cm 2 /h and 0. 27 ng/cm 2 /h through Caucasian skin. The cumulative mass of platinum permeated after 24 hours of exposure was statistically significantly (p = 0. 044) higher through African skin (37. 52 ng/cm 2) than Caucasian skin (5. 05 ng/cm 2). The retention of platinum in African skin (3 064. 13 ng/cm 2) was more than twice the mass retained in Caucasian skin (1 486. 32 ng/cm 2). Conclusions: The in vitro diffusion method is an applicable method to determine skin permeability of metals. However, the experimental design and format of data reporting should be standardised to enable comparison of results from different studies. Platinum and rhodium permeated through intact human skin, with platinum permeation significantly higher. African skin was significantly more permeable by platinum than Caucasian skin. Both platinum and rhodium were retained inside the skin after 24 hours of exposure, possibly forming a reservoir which could contribute to continued permeation through the skin even after removal thereof from the skin. Platinum and rhodium permeated through full thickness skin and thereby could possibly contribute to local skin symptoms such as dermatitis and urticaria found in occupationally exposed workers. By permeating through the upper layers of the skin, these metals could potentially reach the viable epidermis and contribute to sensitisation. Doctora...|$|R
