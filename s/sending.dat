He stated that there is no use of simply acquiring titles or amassing wealth if one has no self-respect or scientific knowledge.

5|$|On December 8, 2011, the Hornets {{agreed to}} a three-team trade <b>sending</b> Paul to the Los Angeles Lakers. The NBA, who owned the team at the time, nullified the deal, with {{commissioner}} David Stern claiming New Orleans {{would be better off}} keeping Paul. The teams involved in the trade attempted to lobby the league to reverse its ruling and reconstruct the deal to no avail. On December 12, the Hornets {{agreed to a}} trade <b>sending</b> Paul to the Los Angeles Clippers, but the deal broke down after the NBA added additional demands to the original terms. Two days later, the teams finally made the trade, <b>sending</b> Paul and two future second round draft picks to the Clippers for future teammate Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, Al-Farouq Aminu, and the Minnesota Timberwolves' unprotected first round pick in the 2012 draft. Upon the deal's completion, Paul announced that he would opt into the final year of his contract and remain in Los Angeles for at least two more seasons.|$|E

50|$|The {{auxiliary}} <b>send</b> routes a split of {{the incoming}} signal to an auxiliary bus, which can then be routed to external devices. Auxiliary <b>sends</b> can either be pre-fader or post-fader, in {{that the level of}} a pre-fade <b>send</b> is set by the auxiliary <b>send</b> control, whereas post-fade <b>sends</b> depend on the position of the channel fader as well. Auxiliary <b>sends</b> can <b>send</b> the signal to an external processor such as a reverb, with the return signal routed through another channel or designated auxiliary return. These are normally post-fader. Pre-fade auxiliary <b>sends</b> can provide a monitor mix to musicians onstage (which they hear through monitor speakers pointing at the performers or in-ear monitors); this mix is thus independent of the main mix.|$|R

50|$|In the 2008 Republican primary, {{states that}} ran early {{primaries}} were punished by {{a reduction of}} 50% {{in the number of}} delegates they could <b>send</b> to the national convention.
