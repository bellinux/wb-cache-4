5|$|Originally, all aetosaurs were {{considered}} {{members of the}} family Stagonolepididae. Early phylogenetic analyses split aetosaurs into two subfamilies, Aetosaurinae and Desmatosuchinae. Aetosaurines are characterized by projections called eminences on the dorsal paramedian osteoderms that are close to the midline of the back. Desmatosuchines have a few more distinguishing characteristics, including grooves on the dorsal paramedians that help them lock to the lateral plates in a tight articulation. Many desmatosuchines have long <b>spikes</b> projecting from the lateral plates. These <b>spikes</b> are especially prominent in Desmatosuchus. Aetosaurines, on the other hand, tend to have less <b>spikes.</b> Many aetosaurines, such as Aetosaurus and Neoaetosauroides, have smooth carapaces and lack <b>spikes</b> altogether. More recent studies (see below) have favored a third group, Typothoracisinae, which like Desmatosuchinae has long <b>spikes,</b> but differs in having more sharply angled joints between osteoderms. Moreover, the genus Aetosauroides is now often classified outside Stagonolepididae as a non-stagonolepidid aetosaur, making the names Aetosauria and Stagonolepididae no longer synonymous.|$|E
5|$|Reproductive {{success is}} {{strongly}} affected by insects that infest the flower <b>spikes</b> and fruiting structures. Infestation {{of the flower}} <b>spikes</b> is not as severe as in other Banksia species: one study found less than 10% of B.telmatiaea inflorescences to be infested, compared to over 50% for B.attenuata (Candlestick Banksia), B.littoralis and B.menziesii (Menzies' Banksia), and over 90% for B.grandis (Bull Banksia). Also, whereas other species were attacked by a range of insects, the inflorescence of B.telmatiaea was attacked only by the tortrix moth Arotrophora arcuatalis (Banksia Boring Moth), which burrows into the woody axis, rendering the spike barren. On the other hand, the same study observed heavy infestation of fruiting structures, with over 90% of <b>spikes</b> with follicles found to contain at least one larva of an unidentified species of moth of the genus Xylorycta. These larvae burrow from follicle to follicle to eat the seed, resulting in 100% seed loss for infested <b>spikes.</b>|$|E

30|$|Although <b>spike</b> {{trains are}} the {{principal}} channel of communication between neurons, a single stimulus will elicit different <b>spike</b> trains from trial to trial. This variability, in both <b>spike</b> timings and <b>spike</b> number can obscure the temporal structure of <b>spike</b> trains and often means that computations need to be run on numerous <b>spike</b> trains in order to extract features common across all the responses to a particular stimulus.

5|$|Debate {{has been}} going on about whether the tail <b>spikes</b> were used for display only, as posited by Gilmore in 1914 or used as a weapon.

However, as Carpenter has noted, the plates overlap so many tail vertebrae, movement would be limited. Bakker also observed that Stegosaurus could have maneuvered its rear easily, by keeping its large hind limbs stationary and pushing off with its very powerfully muscled but short fore limbs, allowing it to swivel deftly to deal with attack.
