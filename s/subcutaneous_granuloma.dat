40|$|Background: Rupture of {{advanced}} atherosclerotic plaques accounts for most life-threatening myocardial infarctions. Classical (M 1) and alternative (M 2) macrophage activation could promote atherosclerotic plaque progression and rupture by increasing production of proteases, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Lymphocyte-derived cytokines may be essential for generating M 1 and M 2 phenotypes in plaques, although {{this has not}} been rigorously tested until now. Methods and Results: We validated the expression of M 1 markers (iNOS and COX- 2) and M 2 markers (arginase- 1, Ym- 1 and CD 206) and then measured MMP mRNA levels in mouse macrophages during classical and alternative activation in vitro. We then compared mRNA expression of these genes ex vivo in foam cells from <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>granulomas</b> in fat-fed immune-competent ApoE knockout and immune-compromised ApoE/Rag- 1 double knockout mice, which lack all T and B cells. Furthermore, we performed immunohistochemistry in <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>granulomas</b> and in aortic root and brachiocephalic artery atherosclerotic plaques to measure the extent of M 1 /M 2 marker and MMP protein expression in vivo. Classical activation of mouse macrophages with bacterial lipopolysaccharide in vitro increased MMPs- 13, - 14 and - 25 but decreased MMP- 19 and TIMP- 2 mRNA expressions. Alternative activation with IL- 4 increased MMP- 19 expression. Foam cells in <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>granulomas</b> expressed all M 1 /M 2 markers and MMPs at ex vivo mRNA and in vivo protein levels, irrespective of Rag- 1 genotype. There were also similar percentages of foam cell macrophages carrying M 1 /M 2 markers and MMPs in atherosclerotic plaques from ApoE knockout and ApoE/Rag- 1 double knockout mice. Conclusions: Classical and alternative activation leads to distinct MMP expression patterns in mouse macrophages in vitro. M 1 and M 2 polarization in vivo occurs in the absence of T and B lymphocytes in either granuloma or plaque foam cell macrophages...|$|R

40|$|Formation of foam cell macrophages, which {{sequester}} extracellular modified lipids, is a {{key event}} in atherosclerosis. How lipid loading affects macrophage phenotype is controversial, with evidence suggesting either pro- or anti-inflammatory consequences. To investigate this further, we compared the transcriptomes of foamy and non-foamy macrophages that accumulate in the <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>granulomas</b> of fed-fat ApoE null mice and normal chow fed wild-type mice in vivo. Consistent with previous studies, LXR/RXR pathway genes were significantly over-represented among the genes up-regulated in foam cell macrophages. Unexpectedly, the hepatic fibrosis pathway, associated with platelet derived growth factor and transforming growth factor-β action, was also over-represented. Several collagen polypeptides and proteoglycan core proteins as well as connective tissue growth factor and fibrosis-related FOS and JUN transcription factors were up-regulated in foam cell macrophages. Increased expression of several of these genes was confirmed at the protein level in foam cell macrophages from <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>granulomas</b> and in atherosclerotic plaques. Moreover, phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of SMAD 2, which is downstream of several transforming growth factor-β family members, was also detected in foam cell macrophages. We conclude that foam cell formation in vivo leads to a pro-fibrotic macrophage phenotype, which could contribute to plaque stability, especially in early lesions that have few vascular smooth muscle cell...|$|R

Methods and Results—We used suppression subtraction hybridization to compare foam cells and nonfoamy macrophages isolated from <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>granulomas</b> of rabbits fed a cholesterol-rich or normal chow diet and confirmed upregulation of 3 genes, including matrix metalloproteinase- 12 (mRNA 2. 0 -fold, P� 0. 005; protein 3. 9 -fold, P� 0. 03). Arginase-I mRNA showed the biggest decrease among 11 downregulated genes in foam cells (2. 7 -fold, P� 0. 001) and was accompanied by significantly reduced arginase enzymatic activity (60 -fold, P� 0. 01). Arginase-I competes for substrate L-arginine with nitric oxide synthase and consequently nitric oxide production was significantly increased (3 -fold, P� 0. 02) in foam cells compared with nonfoamy macrophages despite no difference in nitric oxide synthase isoenzyme expression. We validated upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase- 12 and downregulation of arginase- 1 in foam cells of rabbit and human atherosclerotic plaques. Conclusions—Our study identified several differentially expressed genes in foam cells and nonfoamy macrophages derived from live rabbits.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the incidence of}} granuloma and its related factors in 180 patients with prostate cancer who showed <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>granuloma</b> formation during androgen deprivation therapy with subcutaneously administered leuprorelin acetate. A granuloma {{was defined as a}} persistent induration over 30 mm in diameter in the injected portion. Small indurations which often developed and disappeared after every injection were excluded. The survey was performed using a questionnaire after receiving written informed consent. Among the 180 patients with prostate cancer, 21 (11. 7 %) developed a granuloma at the injection portion, and subsequently the injection of leuprorelin acetate had to be discontinued. Eighteen of the 21 patients alternatively received goserelin acetate. Three patients had high-grade granulomas with ulcer and abscess formation, and were successfully treated with oral antibiotics. The average duration between the first injection of leuprorelin acetate and granuloma formation was 20. 2 months (range : 4 to 62 months).

This study examined whether various cells of the MPS can be induced to differentiate into cells capable of the highly specialized osteoclastic function of lacunar bone resorption. We isolated mouse and rat monocytes, mouse (liver, peritoneal, alveolar, brain) tissue macrophages, and spleen and marrow haemopoietic cells, as well as foreign body macrophages and macrophage polykaryons derived from <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>granulomas</b> formed by implantation of latex beads and coverslips in mice.

Bone resorption was seen as early as 4 days after monocytes were co-cultured with UMR 106 cells. With the exception of bone marrow-derived cells, lacunar resorption was not seen in the absence of UMR 106 cells. These findings show that a bone-derived stromal cell element is necessary for differentiation of monocytes and tissue and inflammatory macrophages into osteoclast-like cells capable of extensive lacunar bone resorption, and would argue in favour of osteoclast membership of the MPS...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{formation}} of foamy macrophages by sequestering extracellular modified lipids {{is a key}} event in atherosclerosis. However, there is controversy {{about the effects of}} lipid loading on macrophage phenotype, with in vitro evidence suggesting either pro- or anti-inflammatory consequences. To investigate this in vivo we compared the transcriptomes of foamy and non-foamy macrophages that accumulate in experimental <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>granulomas</b> in fat-fed ApoE null mice or normal chow-fed wild-type mice, respectively. Consistent with previous studies in peritoneal macrophages from LDL receptor null mice (Spann et al., 2012 [1]), we found that anti-inflammatory LXR/RXR pathway genes were over-represented in the foamy macrophages, but there was no change in M 1 or M 2 phenotypic markers. Quite unexpectedly, however, we found that genes related to the induction of fibrosis had also been up-regulated (Thomas et al., 2015 [2]). The progression of the foamy macrophages along anti-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways was confirmed using immunohistochemistry (described fully in our primary research article (Thomas et al., 2015 [2]). Here we provide additional details on production of the macrophages and their transcriptomic comparison, with the raw and processed microarray data deposited in GEO (accession number GSE 70126). Our observations on these cells are indeed paradoxical, because foamy macrophages have long been implicated in promoting inflammation, extracellular matrix degradation and atherosclerotic plaque rupture, which must be provoked by additional local mediators. Our findings probably explain how very early macrophage-rich lesions maintain their structural integrity...|$|R

40|$|Type II (lepromatous) granulomas are {{characterized}} {{by a lack of}} organization, with large numbers of macrophages heavily burdened with bacilli and disorganized lymphocyte infiltrations. Type II granulomas are a characteristic feature of the enteric lesions that develop during clinical Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis infection in the bovine. Considering the poor organization and function of these granulomas, it is our hypothesis that dendritic cell (DC) function within the granuloma is impaired during initial infection. In order to test our hypothesis, we used a subcutaneous M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis infection model to examine early DC function within M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-induced granulomas. In this model, we first characterized the morphology, cellular composition, and cytokine profiles of <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>granulomas</b> that develop 7 days after subcutaneous inoculation with either vaccine or live M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis. Second, we isolated CD 11 c+ cells from within granulomas and measured their maturation status and ability to induce T-cell responses. Our results demonstrate that M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis or vaccine administration resulted in the formation of distinct granulomas with unique cellular and cytokine profiles. These distinct profiles corresponded to significant differences in the phenotypes and functional responses of DCs from within the granulomas. Specifically, the DCs from the M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-induced granulomas had lower levels of expression of costimulatory and chemokine receptors, suggesting limited maturation. This DC phenotype was associated with weaker induction of T-cell proliferation. Taken together, these findings suggest that M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis infection in vivo influences DC function, which may shape the developing granuloma and initial local protection...|$|R

However, the units of recovered collagenase inhibitor were several fold higher in all RP granulomas in comparison with DP granulomas (6. 88 +/- 2. 46 vs 1. 5 +/- 0. 53). Therefore, DP and RP tissues exhibited similar total amount of tissue inhibitor. By HPLC, collagenase inhibitor activity was localized in a fraction consistent with the size of TIMP. These results suggest a different balance of collagenase and collagenase inhibitor during the evolution of the granulom...|$|R
40|$|Rhinoplasty is {{regarded}} {{to be associated}} with many risks as the expectations of patient and physician are not always corresponding. Besides of postoperative deformities many other risks and complications have to be considered. Reduction-rhinoplasty e. g. can cause breathing disturbances which are reported in 70 % of all revision-rhinoplasty-patients. One has to be aware however that scars and loss of mucosal-sensation can also give the feeling of a “blocked nose”. The main risks of autogenous transplants are dislocation and resorption, while alloplasts can cause infection and extrusion. In this respect silicone implants can have a complication rate between 5 - 20 %. Less complications are reported with other materials like Gore-Tex. Complications of skin and soft tissues can be atrophy, fibrosis, numbness, cysts originating from displaced mucosa or <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>granulomas</b> caused by ointment material. Postoperative swelling depends mainly on the osteotomy technique. Percutaneous osteotomies cause less trauma, but may result in visible scars. Infections are rare but sometimes life-threatening (toxic-shock-syndrome). The risk is higher, when sinus surgery and rhinoplasty are combined. Osteotomies can also cause injuries of the orbital region. Necrosis of eye-lids by infections and blindness by central artery occlusion are known. There are reports on various other risks like rhinoliquorrhea, brain damage, fistulas between sinus-cavernosus and carotid artery, aneurysms and thrombosis of the cavernous sinus. Discoloration of incisors are possible by damage of vessels and nerves. Rhinoplasty can also become a court-case in dissatisfied patients, a situation that may be called a “typical complication of rhinoplasty”. It can be avoided by proper patient selection and consideration of psychological disturbances. Postoperative deformities are considered as main risks of rhinoplasty, causing revision surgery in 5 % to 15 % of the cases. The analysis of postoperative deformities allowes the identification of specific risks. The most frequent postoperative deformity is the “pollybeak” when a deep naso-frontal angle, cartilaginous hump and reduced tip projection are present preoperatively. The pollybeak is the indication in about 50 % of all revision rhinoplasties. Other frequent postoperative deformities are a pendant and wide nasal tip, retractions of the columella base or irregularities of the nasal dorsum. These deformities are very often combined and caused by a loss of septal support. This is why the stability of the caudal septum in septorhinoplasty is the key for a predictable result. Maintaining the position of the tip and the columella {{is one of the main}} issues to avoid typical postoperative deformities. The risks for rhinoplasty-complications can be reduced with increasing experience. A prerequisite is continuing education and an earnest distinction between complication and mistake...|$|R
