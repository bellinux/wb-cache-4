This review does not precisely locate the important fractures, but we establish a conceptual model and make recommendations on geophysical surveys that may be useful in siting new wells. We further make recommendations on potential drill sites based on existing data, data that should be taken during drilling, the importance of production-well diameters sufficient for pump settings, and the importance of re-injection wells.|$|R

40|$|The {{water budget}} in clay shale terrain is {{controlled}} by a complex interaction between the vertisol soil layer, the underlying fractured rock, land use, topography, and seasonal trends in rainfall and evapotranspiration. Rainfall, runoff, lateral flow, soil moisture, and groundwater levels were monitored over an annual recharge cycle. Four phases of soil–aquifer response were noted over the study period: (1) dry-season cracking of soils; (2) runoff initiation, lateral flow and aquifer recharge; (3) crack closure and down-slope movement of subsurface water, with surface seepage; (4) a drying phase. Surface flow predominated within the watershed (25 % of rainfall), but lateral flow through the soil zone continued {{for most of the}} year and contributed 11 % of stream flow through surface seepage. Actual flow through the fractured shale makes up {{a small fraction of the}} water budget but does appear to influence surface seepage by its effect on valley-bottom storage. When the valley soil storage is full, lateral flow exits onto the valley-bottom surface as seasonal <b>seeps.</b> <b>Well</b> response varied with depth and hillslope position.

40|$|The {{hydrothermal}} {{system at}} Vulcano, Aeolian Islands (Italy), {{is home to}} a wide variety of thermophilic,chemolithoautotrophic archaea and bacteria. As observed in laboratory growth studies, these organisms may use an array of terminal electron acceptors (TEAs), including O 2, NO- 3,Fe(III),elemental sulphur and CO 2; electron donors include H 2,Fe 2 +,H 2 S and CH 4. Concentrations of inorganic aqueous species and gases were measured in 10 hydrothermal fluids from <b>seeps,</b> <b>wells</b> and vents on Vulcano. These data were combined with standard Gibbs free energies () to calculate overall Gibbs free energies (DGr) of 90 redox reactions that involve 16 inorganic N-, S-, C-, Fe-, H- and O-bearing compounds. It is shown that oxidation reactions with O 2 as the TEA release significantly more energy (normalized per electron transferred) than most anaerobic oxidation reactions, but the energy yield is comparable or even higher for several reactions in which, or Fe(III) serves as the TEA. For example, the oxidation of CH 4 to CO 2 coupled to the reduction of Fe(III) in magnetite to Fe 2 + releases between 94 and 123 kJ/mol e–, depending on the site. By comparison, the aerobic oxidation of H 2 or reduced inorganic N-, S-, C- and Fe-bearing compounds generally yields between 70 and 100 kJ/mol e–. It is further shown that the energy yield from the reduction of elemental sulphur to H 2 S is relatively low (8 – 19 kJ/mol e–) despite being a very common metabolism among thermophiles. In addition,for many of the 90 reactions evaluated at each of the 10 sites, values of DGr tend to cluster with differences < 20 kJ/mol e–. However, large differences in DGr up to ~ 60 kJ/mol e–) are observed in Fe redox reactions, due largely to considerable variations in Fe 2 +, H + and H 2 concentrations. In fact, at the sites investigated, most variations in DGr arise from differences in composition and not in temperature...|$|R

We investigated the CH 4 concentration field around pockmarks in Lake Constance by application of membrane inlet mass spectrometry (Inspectr 200 - 200) combined with a submersible pump system.

40|$|The {{development}} of comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC x GC) has expanded the analytical window for studying complex mixtures like oil. Compared to traditional gas chromatography, this technology separates and resolves {{at least an}} order of magnitude more compounds, has a much larger signal to noise ratio, and sorts compounds based on their chemical class; hence, providing highly refined inventories of petroleum hydrocarbons in geochemical samples that was previously unattainable. In addition to the increased resolution afforded by GC x GC, the resulting chromatograms have been used to estimate the liquid vapor pressures, aqueous solubilities, octanol-water partition coefficients, and vaporization enthalpies of petroleum hydrocarbons. With these relationships, powerful and incisive analyses of phase-transfer processes affecting petroleum hydrocarbon mixtures in the environment are available. For example, GC x GC retention data has been used to quantitatively deconvolve the effects of phase transfer processes such as water washing and evaporation. In short, the positive attributes of GC x GC-analysis have led to a methodology that has revolutionized the analysis of petroleum hydrocarbons. Overall, this research has opened numerous fields of study on the biogeochemical "genetics" (referred to as petroleomics) of petroleum samples in both subsurface and surface environments.

Meiofauna abundance, diversity, and community composition at genus level were compared between these seep sites, and with those of tubeworms from hydrothermal vents of the East Pacific Rise (Gollner et al. 2007; Mar Ecol Prog Ser 337 : 39 – 49). The abundance was not significantly different between the 2 seep sites, and was also {{similar to those found}} at vents. A total of 150 meiobenthic genera were identified from the cold seep sites. While no significant difference in univariate measurements of diversity was detected, a shift in community composition between the shallow and the deep seep site was found. The hot vent communities included a total of only 17 genera and the diversity measurements were significantly lower at vents than at seeps. Also, Bray-Curtis dissimilarity was 97 % between the meiobenthic communities from seeps and vents. The genera richness was negatively correlated with maximum temperature and maximum sulfide concentration, and positively correlated with minimum pH value. We conclude that the harsh conditions tubeworms experience at vents compared to the moderate conditions at cold <b>seeps,</b> as <b>well</b> as the longevity of cold seeps surrounded by sedimented deep-sea plains but short-lived vents on basaltic mid-ocean ridges, might explain the contrasting diversity patterns...|$|R

Over 350 samples were collected for DIC and TA measurements on the first cruise and 115 samples were collected on the second cruise.

B. childressi, however, hosts only a single methanotrophic symbiont, {{and the possibility of}} trophic plasticity has not been fully examined in this species. Feeding strategies of archival specimens from 2 geochemically contrasting seeps from the Gulf of Mexico (Bush Hill and Brine Pool NR- 1) were characterized using 4 -source mixing analysis of δ 13 C, δ 15 N and δ 34 S values. Bush Hill mussels used a single thermogenic methane pool and derived N and S from different sources. Brine Pool mussels used 2 separate methane pools; the primary one being biogenic and the secondary possibly a mix of biogenic and thermogenic. Utilization of particulate material was less common at Brine Pool than at Bush Hill. Bush Hill appears to offer lower levels of methane-based resources with particulate material having a greater, and sometimes dominant role in nutrition. Spatial patterns within the seeps were found but were not reflective of simple gradients. Some temporal changes occurred at both yearly scales and between samples, which were collected 17 yr apart. The 4 -source mixing model used extrapolations of mussel isotope values and limited environment characterization to infer likely trophic sources. The actual sources, however, remain unidentified.

In terms of climate, fynbos is comparable with other Mediterranean systems found around the Mediterranean in Europe, {{in parts of}} Chile, south-western Australia and in the Chaparral in California (Aschmann, 1973). The Cape Floristic Region, of which fynbos is part, {{is one of the}} world's most botanically diverse regions, home to an estimated 9030 vascular species (Goldblatt, 1978; Goldblatt and Manning, 2002). The region has exceptionally high levels of endemism. Almost 69 % of its 8920 species of flowering plants are endemic (Goldblatt and Manning, 2002), and, despite its small area, it is {{regarded as one of the}} six global plant kingdoms (Takhtajan, 1986). Ericaceae, Iridaceae, Proteaceae and the Restionaceae are well represented and there are a number of families that are endemic or nearly so (Goldblatt and Manning, 2002).

The field research was conducted using a flux buoy designed to simultaneously measure the surface bubbling gas flux and the buoy’s position with differential GPS, and to collect gas samples. Results show that the flux from the five seeps surveyed a total of 11 times ranged from 800 – 5, 500  m 3  day− 1. The spatial distribution of flux from the five <b>seeps</b> was <b>well</b> described by two lognormal distributions fitted to two flux ranges. The seafloor and sea surface composition of bubbles differed, with the seafloor bubbles containing significantly more CO 2 (3 – 25 %) and less air (N 2 and O 2). At the sea surface, the mole fraction of N 2 correlated directly with O 2 (R 2 = 0. 95) and inversely with CH 4 (R 2 = 0. 97); the CO 2 content was reduced to the detection limit (< 0. 1 %). These data demonstrate that the bubble composition is modified by gas exchange during ascent: dissolved air enters, and CO 2 and hydrocarbon gases leave the bubbles. The mean surface composition at the five seeps varied with water depth and gas flux, with more CH 4 and higher CH 4 /N 2 ratios found in shallower seeps with higher flux. It is suggested that the CH 4 /N 2 ratio is a good proxy for total or integrated gas loss from the rising bubbles, although additional study is needed before this ratio can be used quantitatively...|$|R

Referenced to the California Air Resources Board (CARB) CO emissions inventory, total CH 4 emissions are 0. 44 +/- 0. 15 Tg each year. To investigate the possible contribution of fossil fuel emissions, we use ambient air observations of methane (CH 4), ethane (C 2 H 6), and carbon monoxide (CO), together with measured C 2 H 6 to CH 4 enhancement ratios in the Los Angeles natural gas supply. The observed atmospheric C 2 H 6 to CH 4 ratio during the ARCTAS (2008) and CalNex (2010) aircraft campaigns {{is similar to the}} ratio of these gases in the natural gas supplied to the basin during both these campaigns. Thus, at the upper limit (assuming that the only major source of atmospheric C 2 H 6 is fugitive emissions from the natural gas infrastructure) these data are consistent with the attribution of most (0. 39 +/- 0. 15 Tg yr- 1) of the excess CH 4 in the basin to uncombusted losses from the natural gas system (approximately 2. 5 - 6 % of natural gas delivered to basin customers). However, there are other sources of C 2 H 6 in the region. In particular, emissions of C 2 H 6 (and CH 4) from natural gas <b>seeps</b> as <b>well</b> as those associated with petroleum production, both of which are poorly known, will reduce the inferred contribution of the natural gas infrastructure to the total CH 4 emissions, potentially significantly.

Compositional data were combined with standard state reaction properties to determine the overall Gibbs free energy (deltaGr) for 120 potential lithotrophic and heterotrophic reactions. Lithotrophic reactions in the H-O-N-S-C-Fe system were considered, and exergonic reactions yielded up to 120 kJ per mole of electrons transferred. The potential for heterotrophy was characterized by energy yields from the complete oxidation of 6 carboxylic acids—formic, acetic, propanoic, lactic, pyruvic, and succinic—with the following redox pairs:O 2 /H 2 O, SO 4 2 -/H 2 S, NO 3 -/NH 4 +, S 0 /H 2 S, and Fe 3 O 4 /Fe 2 +. Heterotrophic reactions yielded 6 – 111 kJ/mol e-. Energy yields from both lithotrophic and heterotrophic reactions were highly dependent on the terminal electron acceptor (TEA); reactions with O 2 yielded the most energy, followed by those with NO 3 -, Fe(III), SO 4 2 -, and S 0. When only reactions with complete TEA reduction were included, the exergonic lithotrophic reactions followed a similar electron tower. Spatial variability in deltaGr was significant for iron redox reactions, owing largely to the wide range in Fe 2 + and H+ concentrations. Energy yields were compared to those obtained for samples collected in June 2001. The temporal variations in geochemical composition and energy yields observed in the Vulcano hydrothermal system between 2001 and 2003 were moderate. The largest differences in deltaGr over the 2 years were from iron redox reactions, due to temporal changes in the Fe 2 + and H+ concentrations.

The depression of the water table also resulted in a change in the source for set sample points in MC 4 and resulted in lower groundwater nitrate than historically measured. The depression of the water table also introduced oxygen and nitrate rich waters to greater depths below the ground surface than what was previously measured. Overall, the mean concentration of nitrate in the multi-level wells was less than the historical data. The decrease in nitrate for the domestic wells and multi-level wells might be related to changes in land management practices over the past three decades. Source identification for nitrate was constrained with the use of nitrate isotope ratios and artificial sweeteners. Domestic <b>wells,</b> groundwater <b>seeps,</b> and multi-level <b>wells</b> were all dominantly identified as nitrified chemical fertilizer, according to the dual isotope plot of nitrate. Artificial sweeteners were detected in 31 % and 35 % of the domestic <b>wells</b> and groundwater <b>seeps,</b> respectively, and were excellent tracers for septic wastewater. Further investigation into the proportion of nitrate derived from wastewater showed that septic systems contributed poorly to the nitrate pool in the LASA. Oxic conditions extended several meters below the water table in the LASA and provided conditions where nitrate could exist at high concentrations. Nitrate removal via denitrification was evident in all datasets, however it was often incomplete and did not remove nitrate entirely. The production of N 2 O in domestic wells and multi-level wells was generally attributed to denitrification in oxygenated groundwaters. In domestic wells, where nitrate was not present, and at the deepest sample points in the multi-level wells, redox conditions were classified having undergone nitrate, sulfate, and iron reduction. However, multi-level well data outlines that this occurs at depths of at least 15 m below the water table. Groundwater seeps were less reduced and did not show evidence for sulfate or iron reduction. Therefore, the capacity of the aquifer to remove nitrate is not sufficient to cope with the amount of nitrate leached from agricultural practices...|$|R
40|$|Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (P AH) are {{ubiquitous}} environmental contaminants {{released from}} different {{sources such as}} forest fires and ocean oil <b>seeps,</b> as <b>well</b> as land based runoff and creosote. These sources of P AHs are both natural and anthropogenic. Some P AHs {{have been known to}} be carcinogenic and mutagenic. In this project, the effects of phenanthrene, a P AH compound. on early embryogenesis involving somitogenesis (development of somites) were studied using zebrafish (Danio rerio) early embryos as an experimental system. The developmental stage relevant to this project was the segmentation stage, during which time somites develop. In early embryos, somite patterning is under the influence of Wnt signaling. Although the process of somitogenesis remains to be fully understood, the "clock and wavefront" model is widely accepted and the process involves a variety of cellular and molecular interactions. This research shows the developmental stage specific effects of phenanthrene on somitogenesis. Other developmental abnormalities due to phenanthrene exposure were also noticed and documented; these abnormalities included pericardiallyolk sac edema and scoliosis. Embryos treated at 2 hours post fertilization (hpt) were most sensitive to phenanthrene exposure and displayed abnormal development of somites and showed a decreased total somite number. Embryos treated at 8 and 12 hpf did not show such abnormalities, suggesting there is a critical time in development when somitogenesis is most affected by phenanthrene. Involvement of the Wnt signaling pathway in somitogenesis with an apparent increase in nuclear -catenin was tested through pharmacological and immunological studies. l-Azakenpaullone, an inhibitor of Glycogen Synthase Kinase- 3 (GSK- 3), was used to target a specific step in the pathway. The results from embryos exposed to this inhibitor were similar to embryos exposed to phenanthrene. Immunostaining of embryos exposed to both compounds reveals nuclear accumulation of -catenin, suggesting that phenanthrene may be causing abnormalities by disrupting a specific step in the Wnt signaling pathway. Preliminary Western blot analysis using antibodies to phosphorylated forms of GSK- 3 (anti-Ser 9 GSK- 3) also supports this notion...|$|R

There was no sewage system in Jerusalem at the time, and sewage often ran in the street, <b>seeping</b> into the <b>wells.</b> The pollution of the drinking water brought about a severe plague, which claimed hundreds of victims, and led to the city being placed under quarantine for four months.

40|$|Filamentous sulfur-oxidizing {{bacteria}} and geochemical parameters of sediments at the Makran accretionary wedge {{in the northeastern}} Arabian Sea off Pakistan were studied. The upper continental slope between 350 and 850 m water depth, {{which is in the}} center of the oxygen-minimum zone, is characterized by numerous sites of small-scale seeps of methane- and sulfide-charged porewater. White bacterial mats with diameters < 1 m were discovered at the surface of these sites using a photo-TV sled. <b>Seep</b> sediments, as <b>well</b> as non-seep sediments, in the vicinity were characterized by the occurrence of the bacterium Thioploca in near-surface layers between 0 and 13 cm depth. Thioploca bundles were up to 20 mm in length and contained up to 20 filaments of varying diameters, between 3 and 75 µm. Up to 169 ind. cm- 2 were counted. Maximum numbers occurred in the top 9 cm of sediment, which contained very low concentrations of soluble sulfide (< 0. 2 µM) and high amounts of elemental sulfur (up to 10 µmol cm- 3). Moderate sulfate reduction activity (between 20 and 190 nmol cm- 3 d- 1) was detected in the top 10 cm of these sediments, resulting in a gradual downcore decrease of sulfate concentrations. CO 2 fixation rates had distinct maxima at the sediment surface and declined to background values below 5 cm depth. The nutritional implications of the distinct morphology of Thioploca and of the geochemical setting are discussed and compared to other sites containing Thioploca communities...|$|R

The sediments at this site are rather flat, sandy and non-permeable, with the presence methane <b>seeps,</b> as <b>well</b> bacterial mats and seep-related fauna. The hydrography of the 70 m deep water column was characterized by a mixed surface layer extending to about 20 m depth and a well-mixed 30 m thick bottom layer that was separated by a stratified interior layer (Figure 1). Amplitudes of tidal velocities were as large as 0. 3 m s- 1 in the bottom boundary layer. Dissipation rates of turbulent kinetic energy (ε) etermined from microstructure shear profiles was weak (10 - 9 W kg- 1 - the detection limit of the profiler) in the thermocline but increased to 10 - 7 - 10 - 6 W kg- 1 approaching the sea floor and the surface (Figure 1). Vertical turbulent eddy diffusivities (KZ, Figure 2) ranged from 10 - 6 m 2 s- 1 in the stratified interior to 10 - 3 m 2 s- 1 and 10 - 4 m 2 s- 1 in surface and bottom boundary layers respectively; the pseudo-velocity, defined as t =L 2 / 2 Kz with L= 1 m (Figure 2) was {{on the order of}} hours to several weeks/months in the stratified interior. High-resolution dissolved oxygen (DO) profiles were measured with a fast galvanic AMT oxygen sensor (response time 0. 2 s) mounted on the microstructure probe. The sensor is capable of resolving oxygen fine structures (1 cm scale), i. e. the structures in the stratified interior, that are completely overlooked by standard slow DO sensors (Figure 1). Vertical turbulent DO fluxes were calculated using the gradient method with locally-measured dissipation rates of turbulent kinetic energy. The average downward turbulent DO flux from the thermocline to the bottom water was estimated to be 4. 4 ± 1. 4 mmol m- 2 d- 1. The AMT sensor now allows us to resolve the before unrealized steep gradient in DO, and to properly characterize the downward fluxes. With benthic DO fluxes from chambers on the order of 7 mmol m- 2 d- 1, the water column depletion should therefore be about 3 - 4 mmol m- 2 d- 1. This agrees with the observed DO concentrations of about 200 μmol L- 1 (67...|$|R
40|$|A Professional Project {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Master of Water Resources, Water Resources Program, University of New Mexico. This study examined the distribution of uranium in drainages in Cove wash in northeastern Arizona. The dispersion of uranium from reclaimed mine sites on the Navajo Nation is not well studied in soils, sediment, and water. During the 1950 s and 1960 s, the Cove mining region produced relative uranium and vanadium ore. Legacy uranium mines in Cove Mesa were reclaimed in phases between the early 1990 s to 1998. Following reclamation, however, in 1999, elevated concentrations of uranium were detected in <b>well,</b> <b>seeps</b> and surface water in the watershed, which are above the EPA’s MCL (30 μg/L). In August 2011, solid (sediment, soil, and rock), and water (surface and ground) samples were collected down-gradient from reclaimed uranium mines on Cove Mesa and in background areas to determine the distribution and characteristics of uranium and other trace metals. In addition, radiometric surveys were conducted in the study drainage area (4. 3 mi 2). Surface and groundwater samples were analyzed for major cations and anions, trace metals, alkalinity, and 18 O. Solid samples were analyzed to determine trace element composition. The results were compared with a 1999 EPA study to determine changes in water chemistry and provide a new baseline value for future investigation. The hypothesis that concentrations of uranium in surface water remain elevated since 1999 was supported. This research provides {{better understanding of the}} current distribution of uranium and other trace metals on the Navajo Nation...|$|R
40|$|Many {{biological}} seep studies {{focused on}} the distribution, structure, nutrition and food web architecture of <b>seep</b> communities as <b>well</b> as on their interaction with the seep geochemistry. However, overall respiration at cold seeps received only little attention. We conducted in-situ oxygen flux measurements in combination with ex-situ oxygen micro-profiles, respiration measurements, as well as rate determinations of microbial methane and sulfate turnover to assess respiration pathways as well as carbon turnover at a seep habitat that was recently discovered alongside the Hikurangi Margin offshore northern New Zealand. This habitat is dominated by dense beds of tube-building, heterotrophic ampharetid polychaetes. Average total oxygen uptake (TOU) from this habitat was very high (83. 7 ?mmol m-? 2 day-? 1). TOU at a non-seep reference site ranged between 2. 7 and 5. 8 ?mmol m-? 2 day-? 1. About 37 % (30. 8 ?mmol m-? 2 day-? 1) of the average TOU was consumed by ampharetids. Considering mean diffusive oxygen uptake (8. 5 ?mmol m-? 2 day-? 1) the remaining fraction of ~? 53 % of the TOU (44. 4 ?mmol m-? 2 day-? 1) might be explained by respiration of epibenthic organisms as well as aerobic methane and sulfide oxidation at the sediment-water interface. The strongly negative carbon isotopic signatures (-? 52. 9 ?±? 5 [per mille sign] VPDB) of the ampharetid tissues indicate a methane derived diet. However, carbon production via anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) was too low (0. 1 ?mmol C m-? 2 day-? 1) to cover the mean carbon demand of the ampharetid communities (21 ?mmol C m-? 2 day-? 1). Likely, organic carbon generated via aerobic methane oxidation represents their major carbon source. This {{is in contrast to}} other seep habitats, where energy bound in methane is partly transferred to sulfide via AOM and finally consumed by sulfide-oxidizing chemoautotrophs providing carbon that subsequently enters the benthic food web...|$|R
40|$|Carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{separated}} from natural gas has been stored successfully below the seabed off Norway {{for almost two}} decades. Based on these experiences several demonstration projects supported by the EU and its member states are now setting out to store CO 2 captured at power plants in offshore geological formations. The ECO 2 project was triggered by these activities and funded by the EU to assess the environmental risks associated with the sub-seabed storage of CO 2 and to provide guidance on environmental practices. ECO 2 conducted a comprehensive offshore field programme at the Norwegian storage sites Sleipner and Snøhvit and at several natural CO 2 seepage sites {{in order to identify}} potential pathways for CO 2 leakage through the overburden, monitor seep sites at the seabed, track and trace the spread of CO 2 in ambient bottom waters, and study the response of benthic biota to CO 2. ECO 2 identified a rich variety of geological structures in the broader vicinity of the storage sites that may have served as conduits for gas release in the geological past and located a seabed fracture and several <b>seeps</b> and abandoned <b>wells</b> where natural gas and formation water are released into the marine environment. Even though leakage may occur if these structures are not avoided during site selection, observations at natural seeps, release experiments, and numerical modelling revealed that the footprint at the seabed where organisms would be impacted by CO 2 is small for realistic leakage scenarios. ECO 2 conducted additional studies to assess and evaluate the legal framework and the public perception of CO 2 storage below the seabed. The following guidelines and recommendations for environmental practices are based on these experiences...|$|R
40|$|During R. V. Sonne cruise SO 191 - 3, {{part of the}} "New (Zealand Cold) Vents" expedition, RCMG {{deployed}} their CHEROKEE ROV "Genesis" on the Hikurangi Margin. This accretionary margin, on {{the east}} coast of New Zealand, is related to the subduction of the Pacific Plate under the Australian Plate. Several cold <b>seep</b> locations as <b>well</b> as an extensive BSR, indicating the presence of gas hydrates, have been found at this margin. The aim of the ROV-work were to precisely localize active methane seeps, to conduct detailed visual observations of the seep structures and activity, and to perform measurements of physical properties and collect samples at and around the seep locations. The ROV allowed first ever visual observations of bubble-releasing seeps at the Hikurangi Margin. Seeps were observed at Faure Site and LM- 3 in the Rock Garden area, at a flat to moderately undulating sea floor where soft sediments alternate with carbonate platforms. Bubble-releasing activity was very variable in time, with periods of almost non-activity (5 bubbles/second) alternating with periods of violent outbursts (190 bubbles/second). Bubbles sizes ranged from less than 5 mm to more than 20 mm. At Faure Site, bubble release was monitored over a period of 20 minutes, resulting in the observation of 6 outbursts, each lasting 1 minute at a 3 minute interval. These violent outbursts were accompanied by the displacement and resuspension of sediment grains and the formation of small depressions showing what is possibly an initial stage of pockmark formation. At the LM- 3 site only some small bubble seeps were observed near a large carbonate platform covered by Bathymodiolus mussels, Calyptogena shells and tube worms. Sediment-temperature measurements, in both areas, were largely comparable with the bottom-water temperature except at LM- 3, at a site densely populated by polychaetes, where anomalous low sediment-temperature was measured. Overall, both seep areas are very confined in space and bottom-water sampling revealed that the released methane has a microbial signature...|$|R
