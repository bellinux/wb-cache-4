50|$|After {{witnessing}} {{firsthand the}} dangers of deploying and retrieving BTs, James M. Snodgrass began developing the expendable bathythermograph (XBT). Snodgrass' description of the XBT:Briefly, the unit would break down in two components, as follows: the ship to surface unit, and surface to expendable unit. I have in mind a package which could be jettisoned, either by the “Armstrong” method, or some simple mechanical device, which would at all times {{be connected to the}} surface vessel. The wire would be paid out from the surface ship and not from the <b>surface</b> <b>float</b> unit. The <b>surface</b> <b>float</b> would require a minimum of flotation and a small, very simple sea anchor. From this simple platform the expendable BT unit would sink as outlined for the acoustic unit. However, it would unwind as it goes a very fine thread of probably neutrally buoyant conductor terminating at the float unit, thence connected to the wire leading to the ship. In the early 1960s the U.S. Navy contracted Sippican Corporation of Marion, Massachusetts to develop the XBT, who became the sole supplier.|$|E

The effect of texturing on cells front side reflectance was studied for alkaline texturing on Cz wafer materials and processes, acidic textured Cz wafers as well as polished Cz wafers and correlated to the electrical characteristics after encapsulation. The electrical performance on module level was studied indoor at STC (standard test conditions) with varying incident light angles and outdoor during one year of outdoor exposure at a location in southern Germany. To consider for optical effects of glass surface on module performance solar glass with various deep surface texture resp. a flat <b>surface</b> (<b>float</b> glass) were processed and characterized. We show that the degree of texturing hence the front side cell reflection has a small influence on the electrical performance after encapsulation with no measurable incident light angle dependency. Furthermore do we show that even for various textured glasses the cell texturing has no effect on the module performance, neither at STC nor at varying incident light angles.

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 A {{comprehensive}} system {{to locate and}} track objects {{in two or three}} dimensional space, using non-contact video sensing techniques is described. The need exists to be able to quantify range and proximity of objects that would be difficult or impossible to measure using standard contact based sensor technology. Available video technology is surveyed and classified. Then, a hardware system is assembled that fulfills the project goal, within given budgetary constraints. The individual components of the system are described in detail. The theoretical solution for single camera, 2 -D positioning, is developed. A device dependent computer algorithm is developed to perform the object location. An accurate multi-camera, 3 -D positioning algorithm is also developed. A method to calibrate the cameras is also described and applied. Computer algorithms to perform calibration and solve the multiple view, 3 -D location geometry are presented. The theoretical equations and most of the algorithms are transferable, not hardware specific. Examples using the 2 -D model are presented. The first test is a submerged, single degree of freedom model that was subjected to wave action. Video tracking data is compared with available positioning data from string potentiometers. The second test is a <b>surface</b> <b>float</b> application where contact sensing methods were not possible. The 3 -D algorithm is demonstrated in an above water test.

40|$|The {{discrete}} element {{method was}} applied to model the impact force of woody debris (trees) on hydrokinetic infrastructure in a river setting. The DEM model, termed the Hydrokinetic Debris Impact Simulator (HDIS) was used to investigate interactions of debris with UAF’s research debris diversion platform (RDDP). The RDDP was designed to protect river energy converters and other hydrokinetic energy infrastructure from floating, woody debris. The RDDP is typically tethered to a <b>surface</b> <b>float</b> that is connected by line and chain to an embedment anchor upstream and below the river bottom. Surface mounted turbines are then tethered behind the RDDP. In this way, the RDDP protects hydrokinetic infrastructure from the impact of trees. HDIS successfully models the interaction and dynamics of discrete bodies (in this case, debris and the RDDP) and determines the forces and torques acting on these bodies due to contact, water, and other, external forces. A key component of the discrete element method is the contact model describing particle-particle interactions. Overall, the discrete element method allows for a realistic simulation of debris-RDDP interactions. In order to improve the fidelity of the drag and buoyancy forces {{as well as the}} debris behavior, HDIS was coupled to a CFD package, OpenFOAM. The OpenFOAM package allows for realistic simulations of the complex hydrodynamics that contribute to the RDDP’s ability to effectively shed debris {{and at the same time}} broadens the utility of HDIS for simulating more complex debris-infrastructure interactions including evaluating failure modes of the RDDP. Example results from HDIS are shown in Figure 1 and output from an OpenFOAM simulation of the flow field around the RDDP are shown in Figure 2. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E

Here χ[subscript]T[superscript]IC was calculated over 120 -min intervals and compared with estimates of χ[subscript]T[superscript]o determined by scaling temperature gradient spectra at high wavenumbers (viscous-convective and viscous-diffusive subranges). Large differences up to a factor of 20 and of unknown origin occur infrequently, especially when both background currents and vertical temperature gradients are weak, but the results herein indicate that 75 % of the data pairs are within a factor of 3 of each other. Tests on 15 -, 30 -, 60 -, 120 -min intervals demonstrate that differences between the two methods are nearly random, unbiased, and less than estimates of natural variability determined from unrelated experiments at the same location. Because the inertial-convective subrange occupies a lower-frequency range than is typically used for turbulence measurements, the potential for more routine measurements of χ[subscript]T exists. The evaluation of degraded signals (resampled from original measurements) indicates that a particularly important component of such a measurement is the independent resolution of the surface wave–induced signal...|$|E

Originally identified by concentrations of <b>surface</b> <b>float</b> material, a drilling and trenching programme of the area in 1997 revealed a chert ‘pod’ in situ interbedded with hydrothermally altered fluvio-lacustrine sediments. This material has allowed further insights {{into the nature of}} the palaeoenvironments and palaeoecology of the Rhynie area during the Early Devonian. Chert morphotypes identified from float blocks and trench material range from laterally discontinuous tabular beds to lenticular pods displaying massive, nodular, lenticular, laminated and brecciated textures. A suite of floral and faunal associations, when combined with distinctive macro and microscopic chert textures, have been used to interpret depositional conditions.   These indicate a suite of palaeoenvironments related to deposition at the hotter and cooler ends of a thermal gradient. Palaeoenvironments ranged from terrestrial laminated, brecciated and vegetated sinter sheets to low temperature pools and marginal aquatic settings. The flora comprises six higher land plant species, nematophytes, charophytes, various fungi and probable cyanobacteria. Anthropods include branchiopods, euthycarcinoids, trigonotarbid arachnids, centipedes and enigmatic myriapods.   Aquatic elements of the biota probably represent normal freshwater organisms. New faunal elements described here include two trigonotarbids, two centipedes, and the first eoarthropleurids known from the area. The first branchipod nauplii from the cherts are described. The arthropod Leverhulmia is here interpreted as a hexapod of uncertain affinities. Comparisons are made with the Windyfield biota and that of other near contemporary assemblages.

Approximation of coordinates of each benthic photo was done based on the photo timestamp and GPS coordinate time stamp, using GPS Photo Link Software (www. geospatialexperts. com). Coordinates of each photo were interpolated by finding the gps coordinates that were logged at a set time before and after the photo was captured.

The method provides a comprehensive picture of nearly simultaneous surface water movements. It represents a significant improvement over conventional <b>surface</b> <b>float</b> and current meter methods because large areas may be covered in great detail with limited personnel and equipment. The goals of this study include the development and documentation of methodology for evaluating and displaying surface current velocities and two dimensional diffusion coefficients using dye tracers, oblique aerial photography and digital computers. Field procedures and data reduction techniques have been tested and modified {{in an attempt to}} provide a maximum amount of useful data with a minimum expenditure of manpower and materials. The study has demonstrated that fluorescent dye tracers, placed in articulated streaks, are conveniently deployed, easily interpreted photographically, conservative with respect to dye wastage and useful for diffusion studies as well as current studies. Individual oblique aerial photographs have been utilized in preference to stereo or vertical photogrammetric methods to eliminate reflected light problems and to allow the use of available aircraft and photographic equipment. Greater course variation and low altitude flights are permissible under some cloud covers that could otherwise preclude the use of other aerial photo methods. Digital computer procedures are described which analyze aerial photo data by (1) determining the six parameters of the camera and photograph orientation based on initial approximations of position and angular rotation and (2) calculating magnitudes and directions of currents and approximate diffusion rates. Computer graphic techniques are presented which are used to display estuary boundaries, velocity vectors and dye patch outlines. This report is intended to become a user's manual for the application of the Oregon State University photogrammetric equipment.
