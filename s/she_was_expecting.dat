5|$|Carrie {{had told}} me in an earlier writing {{appointment}} that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>expecting</b> this album to have darker tones than any of her earlier records.

Carrie really got into the story and making sure we didn't give away how the two women {{got rid of the}} man the song is about. This kind of song is really tricky because you need enough detail to tell the story and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we managed to pull that off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to leave out.|$|E

25|$|Parnell's {{leadership}} was first {{put to the}} test in February 1886 when he forced the candidature of Captain William O'Shea, who had negotiated the Kilmainham Treaty, for a Galway by-election.
