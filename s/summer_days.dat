5|$|A {{spin-off}} titled <b>Summer</b> <b>Days,</b> {{was released}} on June 23, 2006, retelling the original game during summer vacation and {{from the perspective of}} Setsuna Kiyoura. Unlike its predecessor, however, <b>Summer</b> <b>Days</b> was almost universally panned for its heavily bugged state, loads of patches, and recall. Another spin-off titled Cross Days {{was released on}} March 19, 2010. Set in the same continuity as School Days, Cross Days follows the life of another protagonist, Yuuki Ashikaga, a high school freshman who also finds himself caught between the affection of two girls, Roka Kitsuregawa and Kotonoha Katsura, during his second term at Sakakino Academy. The game also features yaoi scenarios, during which Yuuki cross-dresses as a maid. 0verflow released Shiny Days on February 2, 2012 which establishes a solid link between the Days series and Radish Vacation series. A third spin-off, Island Days, was developed for the Nintendo 3DS and was released in Japan on July 3, 2014. The game, developed by Klon, focuses on Makoto and the girls becoming trapped on a remote island and includes tower defense elements.|$|E
5|$|King Faysal, who {{recently}} returned to Iraq {{from a medical}} vacation, was very stressed during the crisis. His health deteriorated even more during the hot <b>summer</b> <b>days</b> in Baghdad. The British chargé d'affaires met him in his pajamas squatting in his bed on 15 August, where he denied that a massacre was committed in Simele. Faysal left Iraq again on 2 September 1933, seeking a cooler climate in London, where he died five days later.|$|E
5|$|Unlike in <b>Summer</b> <b>Days,</b> {{the story}} in Cross Days is not rewritten as a {{spin-off}} of the original story, but occurs during the events of it, making the game a parallel series to School Days. As such, the undisclosed location of the story remains the same with focus being around the school. All signature characters and their established relationships appear in the game, with six new cast members.|$|E

5|$|As was {{the case}} for School Days and <b>Summer</b> <b>Days,</b> the {{original}} soundtrack of Cross Days was reproduced for distribution alongside the game, initially scheduled for February 27, 2009. As this {{was the first of the}} later six postponements, however, the album was republished and deferred to June 26. Following the second delay, the soundtrack was held indefinitely until 0verflow announced on April 16, 2010 that it would be released April 21. The album contains all of the game's background music, all of which was composed by HIKO of KIRIKO/HIKO Sound, and theme songs performed by Yozuca*, iyuna, Ceui, Kotaro Odaka and Riryka, totaling 25 tracks.|$|E
5|$|Scarborough's {{climate is}} {{moderate}} for Canada {{due to its}} southerly location within the country and its proximity to Lake Ontario. It has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa/Dfb), with warm, humid summers and generally cold winters. Mean temperature and precipitation tends to be slightly lower than the downtown core or south Etobicoke for instance, {{due in part to}} the weather station being farther from the moderating influence of the lake and also because of its more northeast location. Conditions vary based on proximity to the lake, with fog more common in the south and areas close to the lake noticeably cooler on hot <b>summer</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E
5|$|Wales {{lies within}} the north {{temperate}} zone. It has a changeable, maritime climate {{and is one}} of the wettest countries in Europe. Welsh weather is often cloudy, wet and windy, with warm summers and mild winters. The long <b>summer</b> <b>days</b> and short winter days result from Wales' northerly latitudes (between 53° 43′ N and 51° 38′ N). Aberystwyth, at the midpoint of the country's west coast, has nearly 17hours of daylight at the summer solstice. Daylight at midwinter there falls to just over sevenandahalf hours.|$|E

5|$|Cross Days follows Yuuki Ashikaga, a bespectacled young lad whose {{withdrawn}} {{school life}} goes awry when his affection for two girls begins to affect his relationships {{with his friends}} and peers. Though unaware of each other, the girls in question constitute {{the premise of the}} game: Kotonoha Katsura, a character well known throughout the franchise as the pivotal love-interest of Makoto Itou, and Roka Kitsuregawa, a newcomer whose efforts to make Yuuki jealous only serve to further complicate her relationship with him. Chie Ashikaga, the mildly abusive older sister of Yuuki, and Kyouichi Kasannoin, Nanami Kanroji's boyfriend, having only previously made cameo appearances in the School Days anime, return to make more prominent roles, as does Ai Yamagata, a character last seen from <b>Summer</b> <b>Days.</b> Rounding up the set of the cast are Ion Ishibashi and Kira Youka, a couple of friends who also make first appearances in the game.|$|E
5|$|From birth, leopard sharks form large schools {{generally}} segregated {{by age and}} sex, {{which may}} intermingle with grey or brown smoothhounds (Mustelus californicus and M. henlei) or spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias). These schools are apparently nomadic, often appearing suddenly in an area {{for a few hours}} and then vanishing just as quickly. In captivity, larger sharks have been observed establishing their dominance over smaller individuals via light nips to the pectoral fins. During <b>summer</b> <b>days,</b> large aggregations of mature females assemble in shallow bays and estuaries, dispersing at night. As these females follow the warmest patches of water, allowing them to raise their internal body temperatures by up to 3°C (5.4°F), they are speculated to be taking advantage of the heat to speed their growth and that of their gestating young. The membership of these aggregations is inconstant, with individual females periodically switching between different sites scattered over several kilometers.|$|E

25|$|Because of Denmark's {{northern}} location, {{there are}} large seasonal variations in daylight. There are short days during the winter with sunrise coming around 8:45am and sunset 3:45pm (standard time), as well as long <b>summer</b> <b>days</b> with sunrise at 4:30am and sunset at 10pm (daylight saving time).|$|E
25|$|Runway 13 was the {{preferred}} departure runway for heavy aircraft {{due to the}} clear departure path, opposite that of the runway 31 departure. Heavy aircraft on departure using runway 13 would commonly be observed using nearly {{the entire length of}} the runway, particularly during <b>summer</b> <b>days</b> due to the air temperature.|$|E
25|$|Western Oregon's {{climate is}} heavily {{influenced}} by the Pacific Ocean. The western third of Oregon is very wet in the winter, moderately to very wet during the spring and fall, and dry during the summer. The relative humidity of Western Oregon is high except during <b>summer</b> <b>days,</b> which are semi-dry to semi-humid; Eastern Oregon typically sees low humidity year-round.|$|E

25|$|The {{southern}} {{third of}} the state, where the Las Vegas area is situated, is within the Mojave Desert. The area receives less rain in the winter but {{is closer to the}} Arizona Monsoon in the summer. The terrain is also lower, mostly below , creating conditions for hot <b>summer</b> <b>days</b> and cool to chilly winter nights.|$|E
25|$|Because of the city's {{location}} in the Whitehorse valley, the climate is milder than comparable northern communities such as Yellowknife. At this latitude winter days are short and <b>summer</b> <b>days</b> have up to about 19 hours of daylight. Whitehorse, as reported by Guinness World Records, is the city with the least air pollution in the world.|$|E

In order to score they must hit 4's (or 6's if allowed).|$|E

25|$|Under the Köppen climate classification, Aspen has a humid {{continental}} climate (Köppen: Dfb) owing to its high elevation. There {{is a large}} diurnal temperature variation between daytime and nighttime temperatures, rendering <b>summer</b> <b>days</b> moderately warm and winter nights very cold for the latitude. Summer lows and winter highs are relatively moderate, with frosts being rare in summer and winter days often averaging above freezing.|$|E
25|$|A {{distinctive}} feature of Tel Aviv’s town-scape are the pilotis on {{which most of}} the apartment buildings in the residential quarters are raised. This feature was achieved on the part of several avant-garde architects in the early thirties in a fierce struggle against the existing municipal bye-laws. The spacious voids between the pillars created a shaded street-scape, added to the natural ventilation during the hot <b>summer</b> <b>days</b> and connected the pavements with the green areas.|$|E
