50|$|Fracture {{energy is}} a {{function}} of displacement and not <b>strain.</b> <b>Fracture</b> energy deserves prime role in determining ultimate stress at crack tip.|$|E
50|$|As an {{alternative}} to J-Q theory, a parameter T can be used. This only changes the normal stress in the x-direction (and the z-direction {{in the case of}} plane strain). T does not require the use of FEM, but is derived from constraint. It can be argued that T is limited to LEFM, but as the plastic zone change due to T never reaches the actual crack surface (except on the tip), its validity holds true not only under small scale yielding. The parameter T also significantly influences on the fracture initiation in brittle materials using maximum tangential <b>strain</b> <b>fracture</b> criterion, as found by the researchers at Texas A&M University. It is found that both parameter T and Poisson's ratio of the material play important roles in prediction of the crack propagation angle and the mixed mode fracture toughness of the materials.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of <b>fracture</b> <b>strain</b> and <b>fracture</b> stress on oral breakdown, bolus {{formation}} and sweetness intensity of semi-solid food gels containing sucrose heterogeneously distributed in layers. The sweetness intensity of gels was mainly affected by the total surface area of gel fragments formed upon chewing. Gels with low values of <b>fracture</b> <b>strain</b> and <b>fracture</b> stress broke down into {{a large number of}} small fragments. These gels were perceived sweeter than gels with high values of <b>fracture</b> <b>strain</b> and <b>fracture</b> stress. <b>Fracture</b> <b>strain</b> had a larger impact on oral breakdown behavior and sweetness intensity than fracture stress. Results indicate that the oral breakdown behavior (i. e. formation {{of a large number of}} small fragments, which leads to an increase in the total surface area) is the driving factor for taste perception in semi-solid gels that have a heterogeneous distribution of sucrose. We suggest that the differences in sweetness intensity in gels containing sucrose heterogeneously distributed in layers and differing in fracture properties result from differences in the frequency of stimulation of taste receptors. An increase in the total surface area of fragments containing sucrose facilitates the release of tastants and increases the frequency of stimulation of taste receptors. Consequently, the taste intensity of gels is enhanced...|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} {{performed}} to determine the ductile <b>fracture</b> <b>strain</b> in uniaxial tensile test of plane specimen. In this project, uniaxial tensile test was performed for three difference material that is aluminum, brass and mild steel. The objective of the test is to identify the value of uniaxial <b>fracture</b> <b>strain</b> for these three difference materials. The specimens have been divided into three difference area: L, P-lateral and S-middle zones. The zones are measured using optical microscope {{before and after the}} tensile test to determine the value of ductile <b>fracture</b> <b>strain</b> at those zones. However, the result from tensile test gives an average value of ductile <b>fracture</b> <b>strain.</b> The second step was to determine the suitable point or area to get the accurate uniaxial ductile <b>fracture</b> <b>strain.</b> The element of the material with stress triaxiality,k = 0. 33 is the location where the uniaxial <b>fracture</b> <b>strain</b> was occurred. Finite element analysis using MSC Patran/Marc 2008 r 1 software was used to determine the element with stress triaxiality,k = 0. 33. In MSC Patran software, the specimen was divided into several nodes to represent the study location for lateral and middle zones. In this project, the model was divided into eleven points. Each point has differences values of stress triaxiality after ultimate tensile strength occurred. The finite element analysis data of engineering stress-strain curve was compared with experiment engineering stress-strain curve {{in order to determine the}} fracture point of the model. The state of stress for each material was determined in order to get the uniaxial ductile <b>fracture</b> <b>strain</b> nodes. The result shows that uniaxial ductile <b>fracture</b> <b>strain</b> occurred at nodes 2577 for aluminium and brass, while uniaxial ductile <b>fracture</b> <b>strain</b> for mild steel occurred at node 2598. It is also shown that the <b>fracture</b> <b>strain</b> at L and P-lateral zones was the nearest to the uniaxial ductile <b>fracture</b> <b>strain...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Concrete {{is a kind}} of {{engineering}} composites, which is broadly used in military and civil structures. The static performance on concrete can not be provided to estimate the variation of concrete under high strain rates concerning dynamic loads. by introducing three point bending test under static and dynamic loads, the plane <b>strain</b> <b>fracture</b> toughness KIC and KId was measured. And with the application of experimental-numerical method, tri-dimensional model has been established by FEM software Ansys/LS-DYNA, to operate transient analysis, and the response curves of stress intensity factor-time can be achieved through opening displacement of fracture. Thus, with obtaining the cracking time by the method of strain-gauge, the dynamic plane <b>strain</b> <b>fracture</b> toughness KId can be determined. Compared the KIc and KId we could conclude a result which meant concrete was more liable to crack under dynamic load.

40|$|Titanium based alloys {{reinforced}} uniaxially with {{silicon carbide}} fibres (Ti/SiC) are advanced and innovative materials for aerospace vehicles. To avoid potential problems, these new materials should be extensively tested and analyzed before application. This {{research focuses on}} experimental fracture toughness study on 0. 5 mm thick Ti/SiC composite materials for aerospace applications. The fracture toughness tests are mainly based on BS 7448 with some modifications for transversely isotropic behaviour of the composite materials. By loading on specimens in the direction perpendicular to the fibre axis, three critical values of fracture toughness parameters characterizing fracture resistance of material, plane <b>strain</b> <b>fracture</b> toughness [Plane <b>strain</b> <b>fracture</b> toughness }, critical crack tip opening displacement [Critical crack tip opening displacement] and critical J-integral [Critical {{at the onset of}} brittle crack extension or pop-in when Δa is less than 0. 2 mm. ]are measured for two kinds of titanium alloy specimens and three kinds of Ti/SiC composites specimens. The values of [Provisional value of Plane <b>strain</b> <b>fracture</b> toughness] obtained from the fracture toughness tests are not valid [Plane <b>strain</b> <b>fracture</b> toughness] for these materials, since the thickness of specimens is insufficient to satisfy the minimum thickness criterion; however, the results could be used as particular critical fracture toughness parameter for 0. 5 mm thick structures of the materials. The valid values of [Critical J at the onset of brittle crack extension or pop-in when Δa is less than 0. 2 mm. ] and [Critical crack tip opening displacement] could be used as fracture toughness parameters for all thickness of structures of the materials. The results also show that: fracture toughness of the titanium alloys decreases dramatically after being unidirectional reinforced with SiC fibre, which is mainly triggered by poor fibre/matrix bonding condition. Moreover, Ti-Al 3 -V 2. 5 reinforced with 25 % volume fraction SiC fibre performs better than the other two composites in fracture resistance...|$|E
40|$|Ease of {{preparation}} and testing are advantages {{unique to the}} chevron-notch specimen used for {{the determination of the}} plane <b>strain</b> <b>fracture</b> toughness of extremely brittle materials. During testing, a crack develops at the notch tip and extends stably as the load is increased. For a given specimen and notch configuration, maximum load always occurs at the same relative crack length independent of the material. Fracture toughness is determined from the maximum load with no need for crack length measurement. Chevron notch acuity is relatively unimportant since a crack is produced during specimen loading. In this paper, the authors use their previously determined stress intensity factor relationship for the chevron-notch short bar specimen to examine the performance of that specimen in determining the plane <b>strain</b> <b>fracture</b> toughness of silicon nitride and aluminum oxide...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimited. This thesis {{is the first}} in a series that is attempting to discover the mechanism by which the fracture toughness J sub 1 C, of HY-series steel decreases with increasing prestrain at room temperature. This decrease J sub 1 C is a function of yield strength and plane <b>strain</b> <b>fracture</b> strain. However, this reduction in J sub 1 C is shown to be caused by a reduction in the plane <b>strain</b> <b>fracture</b> strain. Fractographic examinations have verified this reduction in the fracture strain and also have shown that regions of very low ductility exist due to alloy segregation that is present in bands. The mechanism for the degradation in the toughness is believed to be such that stress relieving following prestraining would restore the toughness. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|Short bar, short rod, and four-point-bend chevron-notch {{specimens}} {{were used}} to determine the plane <b>strain</b> <b>fracture</b> toughness of hot-pressed silicon nitride and sintered aluminum oxide brittle ceramics. The unique advantages of this specimen type are: (1) the production of a sharp natural crack during the early stage of test loading, so that no precracking is required, and (2) the load passes through a maximum at a constant, material-independent crack length-to-width ratio for a specific geometry, so that no post-test crack measurement is required. The plane <b>strain</b> <b>fracture</b> toughness is proportional to the maximum test load and functions of the specimen geometry and elastic compliance.

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} {{identify}} experimental limit <b>strains</b> at <b>fracture</b> for metallic sheets under in-plane biaxial loadings, a specific specimen shape has to be defined. Ideally, the proposed geometry must lead to fracture at the specimen center whatever the strain path imposed by the experimental device. If such condition is ensured, the whole strain paths ranging from equi-biaxial to uniaxial could experimentally investigated. Based on literature review, four in-plane cross specimen shapes have been selected owing to strong potential to reach large <b>strain</b> and <b>fracture</b> in their central point. From finite element simulations, the behavior of these different shapes is evaluated. Based on these numerical results, a new shape is proposed and optimized for determining the forming limits at fracture of DP 600 sheet metal with a thickness of 2 mm.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the relationship between plane <b>strain</b> <b>fracture</b> toughness, KIc, the tensile properties, and the microstructure of the overaged 7449 aluminum-plate alloy, and compares them to the 7150 alloy. The 7449 alloy has a higher content of ??/? precipitates; and, the 7150 alloy contains a greater amount of coarse intermetallic particles, as it contains an appreciable amount of coarse S phase (Al 2 CuMg), which is largely absent in the 7449 alloy. The toughness of the alloys shows an increase on overaging, and the 7449 alloy shows a reasonably linear toughness—yield strength relation on extended overaging. Several mechanisms of failure occur: coarse voiding at intermetallics and a combined intergranular/transgranular shear fracture mode, with the former becoming more important as overaging progresses. Drawbacks of existing models for toughness are discussed, and a new model for plane <b>strain</b> <b>fracture</b> toughness, based on the microstructurally dependent work-hardening factor, KA, introduced in Ashby's theory of work hardening, is developed.

50|$|A general {{parameter}} {{that indicates}} the formability and ductility of a material is the <b>fracture</b> <b>strain</b> which {{is determined by}} a uniaxial tensile test (see also <b>fracture</b> toughness).

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results from characterization of the failure behaviour of hot stamped USIBOR® 1500 -AS steel sheet with tailored properties. A phenomenological approach is used in which failure strain is characterized {{as a function of}} stress state and as-hot stamped condition, {{based on the results of}} an extensive experimental campaign. A range of material quench conditions are investigated, resulting in a multitude of material microstructures. Considering the framework for tailored hot stamping using in die heating to achieve different material responses, six different material quench conditions were considered in this work, ranging from fully martensitic (Vickers microhardness of 485 HV) to a mixed ferrite-bainite microstructure (185 HV). Four of the material quench conditions investigated were produced using laboratory equipment, while the remainder were obtained from tailored axial crush components that were quenched with die temperatures of 400 and 700 °C. Miniature shear, butterfly, hole expansion, hole tensile, and hemispherical dome tests were developed for fracture characterization of sheet metal and digital image correlation (DIC) techniques were used extensively in order to obtain <b>fracture</b> <b>strains</b> and strain paths for the different experiments. Notched tensile specimens were also tested, however these specimens were not used for fracture characterization, due to their non-proportional loading paths and indeterminate fracture locations. Considering <b>fracture</b> <b>strain</b> to be a function of stress state and assuming the material investigated in this work to be isotropic and von Mises yielding, the equivalent <b>strain</b> at <b>fracture</b> and stress triaxiality of each experiment was determined from DIC-measured major and minor <b>strains.</b> <b>Fracture</b> loci were then calibrated for different material quench conditions. The validity of the experimental fracture locus was probed using a number of non-proportional loading experiments, in which specimens were initially pre-strained in equi-biaxial tension, before being subjected to loading states of simple shear or uniaxial tension. Additionally, work was done to adapt and apply the experimental fracture loci to impact simulations of hot stamped components with tailored properties, requiring development of “model dependent fracture loci”. There was found to be an inverse relationship between material hardness and measured <b>fracture</b> <b>strain,</b> with the fully martensitic material quench condition (485 HV) possessing the lowest ductility, while the greatest <b>fracture</b> <b>strains</b> were measured in the samples produced through die quenching at 700 °C (185 HV). For the range of material conditions considered, the lowest <b>fracture</b> <b>strains</b> corresponded to a plane strain loading condition, while the <b>fracture</b> <b>strains</b> measured in simple shear were considerably greater. The material quench conditions, ordered in increasing ductility, are as follows (<b>fracture</b> <b>strains</b> for simple shear and plane-strain tension included in parentheses) : fully martensitic (0. 54, 0. 15), intermediate forced air quench (0. 68, 0. 22), fully bainitic (0. 90, 0. 36), 400 °C die quench (1. 01, 0. 38), and 700 °C die quench (1. 05, 0. 44) ...|$|R

The material of the investigated pipe is a high-density polyethylene, (HDPE) which is commonly used in natural gas piping systems.

The crosshead speed ranged from 5 to 500 mm/min and specimen thickness ranged from 9 to 45 mm for both welded and unwelded specimens at room temperature, Ta equal 20 oC.
