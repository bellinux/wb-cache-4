5|$|The {{color of}} the <b>smoke</b> {{indicates}} the results to the people assembled in St Peter's Square. Dark <b>smoke</b> (fumata nera) indicates that the ballot {{did not result in}} an election, while white <b>smoke</b> (fumata bianca) announces that a new pope was chosen. Originally, in the event a pope was not elected, damp straw was added to the fire to create dark <b>smoke.</b> In the event a new pope was elected, the ballots were burned alone, creating white <b>smoke.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{primary risk}} factor for COPD {{globally}} is tobacco smoking. Of those who <b>smoke</b> about 20% will get COPD, and {{of those who are}} lifelong smokers about half will get COPD. In the United States and United Kingdom, of those with COPD, 80–95% are either current smokers or previously smoked. The likelihood of developing COPD increases with the total <b>smoke</b> exposure. Additionally, women are more susceptible to the harmful effects of <b>smoke</b> than men. In non-smokers, secondhand <b>smoke</b> is the cause of about 20% of cases. Other types of <b>smoke,</b> such as, marijuana, cigar, and water pipe <b>smoke,</b> also confer a risk. Water pipe <b>smoke</b> appears to be as harmful as smoking cigarettes. Problems from marijuana <b>smoke</b> may only be with heavy use. Women who <b>smoke</b> during pregnancy may increase the risk of COPD in their child. For the same amount of cigarette smoking, women have a higher risk of COPD than men.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 1945 (when Pius XII {{changed the}} form of ballot to use {{anonymous}} oaths, first carried out in 1958), the sealing wax on the complex type ballots illustrated above {{had the effect of}} making the <b>smoke</b> from burning the ballots either black or white, depending on whether or not damp straw was added. Until the 20th century, sealing wax customarily had beeswax mixed into its composition. The use of wax made solely from animal fat does not give as much white colored <b>smoke,</b> as does wax that includes beeswax. In the 1939 conclave there was some confusion over the <b>smoke</b> color, which was even more apparent in the 1958 conclave. This explains the confusion over the color of the <b>smoke</b> in the 1958 Papal conclave, caused by the lack of sealing wax on the ballots.

5|$|The {{amount of}} {{americium}} {{in a typical}} new <b>smoke</b> detector is 1microcurie (37kBq) or 0.29 microgram. This amount declines slowly as the americium decays into neptunium-237, a different transuranic element with a much longer half-life (about 2.14 million years). With its half-life of 432.2 years, the americium in a <b>smoke</b> detector includes about 3% neptunium after 19 years, and about 5% after 32 years. The radiation passes through an ionization chamber, an air-filled space between two electrodes, and permits a small, constant current between the electrodes. Any <b>smoke</b> that enters the chamber absorbs the alpha particles, which reduces the ionization and affects this current, triggering the alarm. Compared to the alternative optical <b>smoke</b> detector, the ionization <b>smoke</b> detector is cheaper and can detect particles which {{are too small to}} produce significant light scattering; however, it is more prone to false alarms.|$|E
