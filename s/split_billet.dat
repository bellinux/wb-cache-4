The objective of this work is to characterize the processing effects of equal channel angular extrusion (ECAE) on aluminum 6063, copper I 10, and filamentary Cu/NbTi composite superconductor. The major objective {{of this study is to}} measure strain uniformity throughout the workpiece after ECAE processing. Other objectives include the determination of the size and width of the shear zone, determination of the depth of the surface affected zone, and comparison of the magnitude of the experimental strain and the angle of element distortion with first order calculations. Several testing procedures have been used throughout this research project. Hardness measurements were used to measure the level of plastic deformation. Square grids were scribed on a <b>split</b> <b>billet</b> in order to record the flow of the metal throughout an ECAE extrusion. An aluminum billet with brass wire inserts oriented perpendicular to the extrusion direction were used to show the deformation of material through multiple extrusions. Electrical resistivity measurements were used to monitor the level of strain throughout the billet. The angle of shear of a material element after a single extrusion is measured to be 63. 63 '. This compares well with theory (63. 43 '). Hardness and resistivity measured across a billet extruded one pass through ECAE vary by less than 1 %. The surface affected zone along the bottom of a billet is determined to be less than 12 % of the billet width. The width of the shear zone varied from one-tenth to three-tenths of the billet height...|$|E
60|$|Gallwey {{did as he}} was bidden, half asleep, {{though he}} heard a beat of hoofs that grew louder. Then there was a {{stamping}} of feet outside, and Leland flung a few <b>split</b> <b>billets</b> through the open top of the stove. A sharp crackling followed, and a blaze sprang up, but the light only flickered here and there, leaving the room almost dark.|$|R

Unlike a froe's {{extended}} handle, the side knife does not permit twisting to lever the split open and so it must be driven through all the way.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Future {{applications}} of ultrafine-grained, high performance materials produced by equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) {{will most likely}} require processing on an industrial scale. There {{is a need for}} detailed microstructural and mechanical characterisation of large-scale, ECAP-processed billets. In the present study, we examine the microstructure and mechanical properties as a function of location and orientation within large (50 x 50 x 300 mm) billets of an Al- 6060 alloy produced by ECAP (90 ° channel angle) with different magnitudes of backpressure. The internal deformation is analysed using a grid-line method on <b>split</b> <b>billets.</b> Hardness is recorded in longitudinal and cross-sectional planes. In order to further characterise the local, post-ECAP mechanical properties, tensile tests in different layers are performed. Moreover, low-voltage scanning transmission electron microscopy observations highlight relevant microstructural features. We find that the homogeneity and anisotropy of mechanical properties within the billets depend significantly on the geometry of the shear zone. We demonstrate that deformation gradients can be reduced considerably by increasing the backpressure: The opening-angle of the fan-shaped shear zone is reduced from ψ ≈ 20 ° to ψ ≈ 7 ° when the backpressure is increased from 0 to 150 MPa. Backpressures of 150 MPa result in excellent homogeneity, with a relative variation of tensile mechanical properties of less than 7 %. Our investigation demonstrates that ECAP is suitable for processing homogenous, high performance materials on a large scale, paving the way for advanced industrial applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{renewable}} energy law (EEG) and the waste wood regulation will influence the energetic use of wood, especially of waste wood. It is foreseeable that from 2000 to 2004 in Germany the electrical energy generated by biomass will triple. The EEG guarantees the reimbursement for electricity generated from biomass in Germany. In the biomass regulation those biomasses are more clearly defined {{to which the}} purchase and reimbursement obligation of the grid operator relate. Since 3 / 1 / 2003 the waste wood regulation offers over and above these fundamentals a deposition for waste wood. This compels the bodies responsible for safe disposal and the disposer of wastes for waste wood to open up new disposal avenues. Up to now biogenic fuels (biomass) in Germany have accounted for {{only a small fraction}} of total energy generation. Financial incentives have strongly increased the use ofbiogenic fuels. In 2000, in Germany there were 280 Mw of installed electrical power from biomass and it is expected there will be 700 Mw electrical power developed from biomass. In Germany the annual growth increment of timber is 30 million ton. As of now 20 million ton of timber are felled. For this reason in the long term a further increase of the use of energy from biogenic fuels is to be expected. In addition to the known <b>split</b> <b>billets,</b> fuel use of wood also involves chips or pellets. These fuels are developed in the trade, under DIN 51731, ONORM M 7133, ONORM 7135, and CEN 335 classifications. In these classifications the mechanical and combustion properties and maximum values for attendant components are provided. The discussion covers properties ofbiogenic fuels; waste wood; and fuel beneficiation...|$|R
40|$|A Masters Dissertation, {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of the award of Master of Science of Loughborough University. Backward extrusion is a popular industrial technique for the manufacture of tube and cans. This report serves to examine the forming loads, metal flow and extrusion defects arising during the backward extrusion of aluminium cups. The report surveys the literature of extrusion with particular interest in backward extrusion. Extrusion was carried out {{with the aid of a}} specially constructed 50 mm backward extrusion tool designed and manufactured by the author. Five extrusion ratios were examined, using both the direct and indirect extrusion directions and flat, conical and nosed punch ends were used to examine metal flow and forming loads for various punch profiles. Forming loads were found to be much greater for direct extrusion and the usual relationship was derived for load/extrusion ratio characteristics. The effects of friction and lubrication were examined and these effects on load and flow patterns were noted. Incremental forming of <b>split</b> <b>billets</b> with grids scribed on the mid-plane was carried out for a variety of punch profiles. This revealed the evidence of a dead metal region forming and arc below the end of flat punches. The geometry of dead metal regions was compared with that derived by an upper bound technique and found to agree well. Also, upper bound loads using this model were derived and found to compare favourably. Forming using conical punch profiles showed that the adoption of a smooth profile similar in geometry to the dead metal zone reduced extrusion leads significantly. Extrusion defects were examined and found to fall into three categories, namely cavitation, internal cracking and shearing of the corner. Cavitation was found to occur when the base thickness becomes smaller than the wall thickness, which was also proved theoretically. Also cracking was found to occur only at large extrusion ratios during direct extrusion. Finally, in the light of conclusions drawn from the work, recommendations were made as to suggestions for further work which could usefully continue the present work...|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} construction starts with gangs of itinerant woodsmen who {{would buy a}} stand of timber for the felling. The regular gangs would operate {{in a similar fashion}} to coppice workers and circulate around 12 stands in 12 years to allow regrowth. The timber was felled and sawn to length. Logs from larger trees were split; that from smaller coppice wood did not require <b>splitting.</b> The <b>billets</b> were roughly shaped with a stock knife and a deep notch put in where the sole and heel meet. All the work was done in green wood which is easier to work than seasoned wood. The clog blocks were then generally stacked up in open pyramids to allow the air to circulate and seasoned for a few months. The offcuts and waste was sold on, either as pea-sticks and firewood to provide money for food or else as fuel to the wool dyeing trade.|$|R
60|$|There was no {{furniture}} in it whatever, beyond the wooden bunk he lay in, and a deerhide lounge chair {{he had made}} during the winter; but the stovepipe from the kitchen led across part of it, and then up again into the room beneath the roof above. It {{had been one of}} Sproatly's duties during the past two weeks to rise and renew the fire when the cold awakened his comrade soon after midnight. At present he was outside the house, whipsawing birch-logs and <b>splitting</b> them into <b>billets,</b> which was an occupation he cherished a profound dislike for.|$|R
60|$|He {{kicked the}} embers {{of the fire}} together, and, after laying on a few {{resinous}} <b>billets</b> <b>split</b> the night before, placed {{an inch or two}} of pork in the frying-pan, and then carefully shook out a double handful of flour from the almost-empty bag. This he beat up with water and poured into the hot pan when the pork was done. He watched it until it hardened a little on one side, when he flung it up into the air and caught it in the pan again. There is an art in making palatable flapjacks out of nothing but flour and water. When the meager breakfast was ready, he awakened Grenfell, who sat up grumbling.|$|R
60|$|Winter set in {{in three}} weeks after Godfrey reached Kara, and the work at the mine had to be abandoned. As much {{employment}} as possible was made for the convicts. Some were sent out to aid in bringing in the trees that had been felled during the previous winter for firewood, others sawed the wood up and <b>split</b> it into <b>billets</b> for the stoves, other parties {{went out into the}} forest to fell trees for the next winter's fires. Some were set to whitewash the houses, a process that was done five times a year; but in spite of all this there was not work for half the number. The time hung very heavily on the hands of those who were unemployed. Godfrey was not of this number, for as soon as the work at the mine terminated he received an order to work in the office as a clerk.|$|R
