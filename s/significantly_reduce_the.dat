5|$|Individual {{nations are}} {{beginning}} to note the effect of fishing on seamounts, and the European Commission has agreed to fund the OASIS project, a detailed study {{of the effects of}} fishing on seamount communities in the North Atlantic. Another project working towards conservation is CenSeam, a Census of Marine Life project formed in 2005. CenSeam is intended to provide the framework needed to prioritise, integrate, expand and facilitate seamount research efforts in order to <b>significantly</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> unknown and build towards a global understanding of seamount ecosystems, and the roles they have in the biogeography, biodiversity, productivity and evolution of marine organisms.|$|E
5|$|On July 20, Presidency Chief of Staff Dilma Rousseff {{announced}} plans to <b>significantly</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> number of flights operating at Congonhas. The plan included banning, within 60 days, all connection, stopover, charter, and international flights and {{the reduction in the}} number of private jets. The airport would only operate direct flights to certain cities in Brazil. The plan also called for a study of the expansion of São Paulo's two current airports and the construction of a third airport in the metropolitan area.|$|E
5|$|Preparedness {{refers to}} {{precautions}} {{that should be}} taken before a thunderstorm. Some preparedness {{takes the form of}} general readiness (as a thunderstorm can occur at any time of the day or year). Preparing a family emergency plan, for example, can save valuable time if a storm arises quickly and unexpectedly. Preparing the home by removing dead or rotting limbs and trees, which can be blown over in high winds, can also <b>significantly</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> risk of property damage and personal injury.|$|E

5|$|Tatum {{considered}} resigning {{in order}} to enter business. University president Byrd, a staunch patron of football at the school, was preparing to campaign for governor, and Tatum feared his successor would <b>significantly</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> number of athletic scholarships available. He and Byrd, however, had also disagreed over the decision to participate in bowl games in violation of conference rules. Tatum was opposed to it, as it greatly increased the difficulty of scheduling and had caused the reduction in number of home games.|$|E
5|$|The committee's {{final report}} {{determined}} that along {{the whole of}} the rocky coast between Land's End and Hartland Point, Padstow was the only potentially safe harbour for the coasting trade when the most dangerous north-westerly onshore gales were blowing. It noted that Padstow's safety was compromised by the Doom Bar and by the eddy-forming effect of Stepper Point. The report recommended initial expenditure of £20,000 to cut down the outer part of Stepper Point, which, in conjunction with the capstans, bollards and mooring rings, would <b>significantly</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> risk to shipping.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} garbage {{collection}} involves reading and rewriting {{data to the}} flash memory. This means that a new write from the host will first require a read of the whole block, a write of {{the parts of the}} block which still include valid data, and then a write of the new data. This can <b>significantly</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> performance of the system. Some SSD controllers implement background garbage collection (BGC), sometimes called idle garbage collection or idle-time garbage collection (ITGC), where the controller uses idle time to consolidate blocks of flash memory before the host needs to write new data. This enables the performance of the device to remain high.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Jatropha gossypifolia {{has been}} used in Indian {{traditional}} system but there is paucity of scientific data on anti-inflammatory activity of root. Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated by TPA (12 - O -tetradecanoylphorbol- 13 -acetate) induced ear inflammation, carrageenan-induced paw edema and cotton pellet granuloma. Topical application of 0. 5 and 1 mg extract <b>significantly</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>the</b> TPA induced ear inflammation. The extract (125 mg/kg p. o) <b>significantly</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>the</b> carrageenan induced edema. Seven days administration of 50 and 100 mg/kg of extract <b>significantly</b> <b>reduced</b> <b>the</b> cotton pellet granuloma.

5|$|To more {{effectively}} minimize recurrence {{and severity of}} epistaxis, other options {{may be used in}} conjunction with therapies listed above. Intravenously administered anti-VEGF substances such as bevacizumab (brand name Avastin), pazopinab and thalidomide or its derivatives interfere with the production of new blood vessels that are weak and therefore prone to bleeding. Due to the past experiences with prescribing thalidomide to pregnant women to alleviate symptoms of nausea and the terrible birth defects that followed, thalidomide is a last resort therapy. Additionally, thalidomide can cause neuropathy. Though this can be mitigated by tinkering with dosages and prescribing its derivatives such as lenolidomide and pomalidomide, many doctors prefer alternative VEGF inhibitors. Bevacizumab has been shown to <b>significantly</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> severity of epistaxis without side effects.|$|E
