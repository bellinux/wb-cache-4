40|$|Employing {{systematic}} {{document analysis}} and other methods, {{this article analyses}} a long-standing and still relevant issue related to the interpretation and application of the law regulating relationships {{in the field of}} European Union criminal justice {{within the framework of the}} national criminal proceedings that are taking place in EU member states. The article places special emphasis on the explanation and application of the principle <b>of</b> mutual <b>recognition</b> within the framework of one of the newest instruments of international cooperation in the European Union criminal proceedings meant to prevent conflicts of exercise of jurisdiction and to solve issues arising between two or more member states. The analysis of conflicts of exercise of jurisdiction provided in this paper is not limited to a mere explanation of the concept as such, but includes an essential analysis of other related issues, such as the principle <b>of</b> mutual <b>recognition,</b> its influence on the <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> criminal <b>proceedings</b> as parallel proceedings, and including other aspects related to the matching of the form of national criminal proceedings with the criminal proceedings taking place in another member state. Finally, significant attention is given to one of the objectives in terms of prevention and solution of conflicts of exercise of jurisdiction, namely, the ne bis in idem principle and its application in case of parallel criminal proceedings taking place in two or more member states. One of the key conclusions offered here is that in order to eliminate conflicts of exercise of jurisdiction, positive law in the process of conflicts of jurisdiction must become an effective measure in criminal justice; however, only on the condition that at least a minimum likelihood in the form of criminal proceedings adopted by different EU members states is ensured as a precondition necessary to enable a smooth application of the principle <b>of</b> mutual <b>recognition...</b>|$|R

40|$|With the Council {{regulation}} (EC) No. 1346 / 2000 of 29 May 2000 on insolvency proceedings, {{that came}} into effect May 31, 2002 the European Union has introduced a legal framework for dealing with cross-border insolvency proceedings. In order to achieve the aim of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of insolvency proceedings having cross-border effects within the European Community, the provisions on jurisdiction, recognition and applicable law {{in this area are}} contained in a Regulation, a Community law measure which is binding and directly applicable in Member States. The goals of the Regulation, with 47 articles, are to enable cross-border insolvency proceedings to operate efficiently and effectively, to provide for co-ordination of the measures to be taken with regard to the debtor’s assets and to avoid forum shopping. The Insolvency Regulation, therefore, provides rules for the international jurisdiction of a court in a Member State for the opening of insolvency <b>proceedings,</b> the (automatic) <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> these <b>proceedings</b> in other Member States and the powers of the ‘liquidator’ in the other Member States.

5000|$|Modified universalism or {{modified}} universality {{is a legal}} concept (particularly an English legal concept) relating to the general principle that in relation to corporate insolvency national courts should strive to administer the estate of insolvent companies {{in the spirit of}} international comity. [...] The broad concept is that it is desirable for cross-border insolvencies to be managed by a single officeholder as a single estate rather than a series of piecemeal and unconnected proceedings in different countries, and that this should be recognised globally. In practice, whilst many countries will recognise foreign bankruptcy proceedings, in many instances the courts have set some limits on the <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> insolvency <b>proceedings,</b> such that the courts apply this principle of modified universality whereby the courts retain a discretion to assess whether the overseas proceedings are consistent with their own principles of justice and public policy. But, subject to that safeguard, the courts will generally defer to the proceedings which are regarded as the [...] "main proceedings" [...] for the purposes of getting in and distributing assets of the insolvent company. [...] The principal is referred as to modified universalism in that it strives to find a balance between purely territorial bankruptcy systems, and entirely universal international bankruptcy system.|$|R
40|$|Background: In 2007 three {{researchers}} {{completed a}} 6 -month study in one 32 -bed acute care medical ward {{in a large}} hospital in New South Wales, Australia. The problem drawn {{to the attention of}} researchers was that approximately 60 % of older people were delirious on arrival or develop incident delirium during their hospital <b>stay.</b> Lack <b>of</b> <b>recognition,</b> underreporting and inadequate care responses to delirium in hospitalised older people signalled a major practice problem. Aim: To collaboratively explore ways in which clinical practice could be improved. Method: We selected Participatory Action Research (PAR) as the methodology to involve health practitioners in practice redesign. PAR is a process in which ‘we’, researchers and participants, systematically work together in cycles of ‘looking, thinking and acting’. Delirium and the high percentage of older people who succumb to this condition was the main practice problem requiring a response. Eight volunteer clinicians and three researchers met weekly as a group for 13 sessions over 6 months. Clinicians set the agenda for redesign of practice. Raising awareness about delirium and its prevention were the selected action strategies. A delirium alert protocol was developed for implementation by the clinicians and later evaluation as a separate study. Findings: There was evidence that practice had changed. Physical and chemical restraints had not been used for 3 months subsequent to the study’s completion. The nurse manager reported that early detection strategies had prevented episodes of acute hyperactive delirium. Whilst there continued to be older people admitted with a diagnosis of delirium, there were fewer incidences of delirium developing on the ward and there was less disruption to other patients, especially at night. The strategy of raising the awareness of delirium in older people was successful. We are confident that working collaboratively with practitioners is the way to bring evidence to practice in delirium care for older people in acute care settings...|$|R

40|$|Genetic {{evidence}} indicates that Drosophila defense against Gram-positive bacteria is mediated by two putative pattern recognition receptors acting upstream of Toll, namely Gram-negative binding protein 1 (GNBP 1) and peptidoglycan recognition protein SA (PGRP-SA). Until now however, the molecular <b>recognition</b> <b>proceedings</b> for sensing <b>of</b> Gram-positive pathogens were not known. In the present, we report the physical interaction between GNBP 1 and PGRP-SA using recombinant proteins. GNBP 1 was able to hydrolyze Gram-positive peptidoglycan (PG), while PGRP-SA bound highly purified PG fragments (muropeptides). Interaction between these proteins was enhanced {{in the presence of}} PG or muropeptides. PGRP-SA binding depended on the polymerization status of the muropeptides, pointing to constraints in the number of PGRP-SA molecules bound for signaling initiation.
