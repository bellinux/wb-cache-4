40|$|A new <b>suicide</b> <b>vector,</b> pRVS 3, was {{constructed}} to facilitate gene replacements in the genome of Paracoccus denitrificans. In control experiments, incorporation of this <b>suicide</b> <b>vector</b> into the genome did {{not depend on}} the presence of homologous DNA. Using appropriate restriction enzymes, the <b>suicide</b> <b>vector</b> and flanking DNA were recovered from the genomic DNA. Sequence analysis demonstrated that both up- and downstream of the ex-integrant vector there was an element that showed high homology with bacterial insertion sequences (IS). Southern blot analysis of wild-type and integrant strains revealed that at least four copies of this IS element reside in the P. denitrificans genome, one of which, designated IS 1248, had been involved in the transpositional event described here. IS 1248 is 830 bp long, has 13 -bp imperfect inverted repeats at the borders, and contains five open reading frames. With respect to the organization and primary sequences of the open reading frames, IS 1248 closely resembles IS 869 and IS 427 of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, IS 402 of Pseudomonas cepacia, and ISmyco found in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. ...|$|E
40|$|A model <b>suicide</b> <b>vector</b> (pBAP 19 h), {{designed}} for the potential containment of genetically engineered microorganisms, was made by constructing a plasmid with the hok gene, which codes for a lethal polypeptide, {{under the control of}} the lac promoter. The vector plasmid also codes for carbenicillin resistance. In the absence of carbenicillin, induction of the hok gene in vitro caused elimination of all detectable cells containing the suicide vector; pBAP 19 h-free cells of the culture survived and grew exponentially. In the presence of carbenicillin, however, the number of cells containing pBAP 19 h initially declined after induction of hok but then multiplied exponentially. The surviving cells still had a fully functional hok gene and had apparently developed resistance to the action of the Hok polypeptide. Thus, high selective pressure against the loss of the <b>suicide</b> <b>vector</b> led to a failure of the system. Soil microcosm experiments confirmed the ability of a <b>suicide</b> <b>vector</b> to restrict the growth of a genetically engineered microorganism in the absence of selective pressure against the loss of the plasmid, with 90 to 99 % elimination of hok-bearing cells within 24 h of hok induction. However, some pBAP 19 h-bearing cells survived in the soil microcosms after hok induction. The surviving cells contained an active hok gene but were not capable of normal growth even after elimination of the hok gene; it appears that a mutation that made them Hok resistant also reduced their capacity for membrane functions needed for energy generation and exponential cell growth. Thus, the model <b>suicide</b> <b>vector</b> was shown to be functional in soil as well as in vitro. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{elucidate}} {{the function of}} a gene in bacteria {{it is vital that}} targeted gene inactivation (allelic replacement) can be achieved. Allelic replacement is often carried out by disruption of the gene of interest by insertion of an antibiotic-resistance marker followed by subsequent transfer of the mutant allele to the genome of the host organism in place of the wild-type gene. However, due to their intrinsic resistance to many antibiotics only selected antibiotic-resistance markers can be used in members of the genus Burkholderia, including the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc). Here we describe the construction of improved antibiotic-resistance cassettes that specify resistance to kanamycin, chloramphenicol or trimethoprim effectively in the Bcc and related species. These were then used in combination with and/or to construct a series enhanced <b>suicide</b> <b>vectors,</b> pSHAFT 2, pSHAFT 3 and pSHAFT-GFP to facilitate effective allelic replacement in the Bcc.

40|$|Insertion {{duplication}} mutagenesis and allelic replacement mutagenesis {{are among}} the most commonly utilized approaches for targeted mutagenesis in bacteria. However, both techniques are limited by a variety of factors that can complicate mutant phenotypic studies. To circumvent these limitations, multiple markerless mutagenesis techniques have been developed that utilize either temperature-sensitive plasmids or counterselectable <b>suicide</b> <b>vectors</b> containing both positive- and negative-selection markers. For many species, these techniques are not especially useful due to difficulties of cloning with Escherichia coli and/or a lack of functional negative-selection markers. In this study, we describe the development of a novel approach for the creation of markerless mutations. This system employs a cloning-independent methodology and should be easily adaptable to a wide array of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species. The entire process of creating both the counterselection cassette and mutation constructs can be completed using overlapping PCR protocols, which allows extremely quick assembly and eliminates the requirement for either temperature-sensitive replicons or <b>suicide</b> <b>vectors.</b> As a proof of principle, we used Streptococcus mutans reference strain UA 159 to create markerless in-frame deletions of 3 separate bacteriocin genes as well as triple mutants containing all 3 deletions. Using a panel of 5 separate wild-type S. mutans strains, we further demonstrated that the procedure is nearly 100 % efficient at generating clones with the desired markerless mutation, which is a considerable improvement in yield compared to existing approaches...|$|R
40|$|A {{challenge}} in strain construction is that unmarked deletion and nucleotide substitution alleles {{generally do not}} confer selectable phenotypes.

The <b>suicide</b> <b>vector</b> containing the same allele is then integrated into the mutant chromosome, generating a tandem duplication homozygous for that allele. The resulting strain {{is used as a}} donor for transductional crosses, and selection is made for a marker carried by the integrated <b>suicide</b> <b>vector.</b> Segregation of the tandem duplication results in haploid individuals, each of which carries the desired allele. To demonstrate this mutagenesis strategy, we used bacteriophage P 22 Hint for generalized transduction-mediated introduction of unmarked mutations to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.

A definitive identification of virulence factors using the molecular version of Koch's postulates has been hindered because of difficulties in performing molecular genetic {{analysis of this}} opportunistic pathogen.

We therefore incorporated USER friendly cloning techniques into pCVD 442 -based allelic exchange <b>suicide</b> <b>vectors</b> and other expression vectors to enable the rapid and efficient capture of PCR amplicons. Upstream and downstream DNA sequences flanking genes targeted for deletion were cloned together in a single step. Based on results from Vibrio cholerae, we determined that V. vulnificus becomes naturally transformable with linear DNA during growth on chitin {{in the form of}} crab shells. By combining USER friendly cloning and chitin-based transformation, we rapidly and efficiently produced targeted deletions in V. vulnificus, bypassing the need for two-step, suicide vector-mediated allelic exchange. These methods were used to examine the roles of two flagellin loci (flaCDE and flaFBA), the motAB genes, and the cheY- 3 gene in motility and to create deletions of rtxC, rtxA 1, and fadR. Additionally, chitin-based transformation was useful in moving antibiotic resistance-labeled mutations between V. vulnificus strains by simply coculturing the strains on crab shells.

Recently we developed techniques to genetically manipulate the gliding bacterium Cytophaga johnsonae (M. J. McBride and M. J. Kempf, J. Bacteriol. 178 : 583 - 590, 1996). We now demonstrate that some of these techniques allow genetic manipulation of a number of environmentally or medically significant bacteria in this group.

The system consists of a collection of <b>suicide</b> <b>vectors</b> the Ralstonia chromosome (pRC) series that carry an integration element flanked by transcription terminators and two sequences of homology to the chromosome of strain GMI 1000, where the integration element is inserted through a double recombination event. Unique restriction enzyme sites and a GATEWAY cassette enable cloning of any promoter::gene combination in the integration element. Variants endowed with different selectable antibiotic resistance genes and promoter::gene combinations are described. We show that the system can be readily used in GMI 1000 and adapted to other R. solanacearum strains using an accessory plasmid. We prove that the pRC system can be employed to complement a deletion mutation with a single copy of the native gene, and to measure transcription of selected promoters in monocopy both in vitro and in planta. Finally, the system has been used to purify and study secretion type III effectors. These novel genetic tools will be particularly useful for {{the construction of}} recombinant bacteria that maintain inserted genes or reporter fusions in competitive situations (i. e., during plant infection) ...|$|R
