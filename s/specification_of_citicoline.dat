40|$|Cytidine- 5 ¢-diphosphocholine (citicoline or CDP-choline), an {{intermediate}} in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine (Ptd-Cho), has shown bene®cial effects {{in a number}} of CNS injury models and pathological conditions <b>of</b> the brain. <b>Citicoline</b> improved the outcome in several phase-III clinical trials of stroke, but provided inconclusive results in recent clinical trials. The therapeutic action <b>of</b> <b>citicoline</b> is thought to be caused by stimulation of PtdCho synthesis in the injured brain, although the experimental evidence for this is limited. This review attempts to shed some light on the properties of citico- 2 line that are responsible for its effectiveness. Our studies in transient cerebral ischemia suggest that citicoline might enhance reconstruction (synthesis) of PtdCho and sphingomyelin, but could act by inhibiting the destructive processes (activation <b>of</b> phospholipases). <b>Citicoline</b> neuroprotection may include: (i) preserving cardiolipin (an exclusive inner mitochondrial membrane component) and sphingomyelin; (ii) preserving the arachidonic acid content of PtdCho and phosphatidylethanolamine; (iii) partially restoring PtdCho levels; (iv) stimulating glutathione synthesis and glutathione reductase activity; (v) attenuating lipid peroxidation; and (vi) restoring Na + /K +-ATPase activity. These observed effects <b>of</b> <b>citicoline</b> could be explained by the attenuation of phospholipase A 2 activation.

[URL] biochemical and cellular events that lead to secondary neural damage after traumatic brain injury (TBI) contribute to long-term disabilities, including memory deficits.

The effects <b>of</b> <b>citicoline</b> and <b>of</b> voluntary physical exercise in a running wheel (3 weeks), alone or in combination, on TBI-related short-term (3 h) and long-term (24 h) object recognition memory (ORM) deficits, and on neurogenesis and neuroprotection were examined using a rodent model of TBI(controlled cortical impact injury). Citicoline improved memory deficits at the two times tested, while physical exercise only in the long-term test. Physical exercise had a clear neuroprotective effect as indicated by reduced interhemispheric differences in hippocampal formation and lateral ventricle volumes and in density of mature neurons in the hilus of the dentate gyrus and the perirhinal cortex. Physical exercise also increased cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus. Some degree <b>of</b> neuroprotection <b>of</b> <b>citicoline</b> was suggested by reduced interhemispheric differences in the volume of the hippocampal formation. Contrary to what was expected, the effects <b>of</b> <b>citicoline</b> and physical exercise did not sum up.

Good resolution between the analyte peak and peaks corresponding to process related impurities and degradation products was achieved on a Whatman Partisil SAX C 18 (250 X 4. 6 mm, 10 µm) column with a mobile phase constituted of phosphate buffer and acetonitrile (40 : 60 % v/v) and further comprises of 1 gm of 1 -hexane sulphonic acid sodium salt. The pH of the mobile phase was adjusted to 3. 4 with ortho phosphoric acid. Detection was performed at 280 nm. Citicoline sodium was subjected to stress conditions of hydrolysis (acid, base), oxidation, photolysis and thermal degradations. The method was validated in accordance with ICH guidelines and the validation data showed that the assay is sensitive, specific and reproducible for the determination <b>of</b> <b>citicoline</b> {{in the presence of}} related substances and degradation products...|$|R
40|$|We have {{evaluated}} the neuroprotective effects <b>of</b> <b>citicoline</b> in relevant phenotypic models of Huntington's disease induced {{by either the}} mitochondrial inhibitor 3 -nitropropionic acid or the N-methyl-D-aspartate agonist quinolinic acid, which, respectively, reproduce the metabolic defect or the excitotoxicity seen in the disease. We found that citicoline failed to reverse behavioural and histological alterations induced by both neurotoxins. In addition, citicoline did not reduce PC 12 cell death induced by the expression of an N-terminal fragment of mutated Huntingtin. Altogether, our results suggest that citicoline is not a potential therapeutic agent {{for the treatment of}} Huntington's disease. Journal Articleinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Citicoline, a {{naturally}} occurring precursor of phosphatidylcholine, is neuroprotective {{and is currently}} being assessed in clinical trials. To evaluate potential synergistic neuroprotective effects <b>of</b> prolonged <b>citicoline</b> treatment and early N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist therapy, suboptimal treatment regimens <b>of</b> <b>citicoline</b> and MK- 801 were tested alone and in combination in a rat model of temporary focal ischemia. METHODS: Four groups of Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 12 per group) underwent 90 minutes of temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with the suture model. Animals were randomly and blindly {{assigned to one of}} four treatment groups: (1) saline, vehicle; (2) MK- 801, 0. 5 mg/kg IV bolus at 60 minutes after MCAO followed by saline 1 mL/kg IP daily for 7 days; (3) saline IV at 60 minutes after MCAO followed by citicoline 250 mg/kg IP daily for 7 days; or (4) both MK- 801 and citicoline (daily for 7 days) active treatment. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining was used to assess postmortem infarct volume. Neurological scores were determined daily. RESULTS: Premature mortality between days 2 and 4 was 33. 3...|$|R
40|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) {{is a major}} cause of death and disability. In the United States alone {{approximately}} 1. 4 million sustain a TBI each year, of which 50, 000 people die, and over 200, 000 are hospitalized. Despite numerous prior clinical trials no standard pharmacotherapy for the treatment of TBI has been established. Citicoline, a naturally occurring endogenous compound, offers the potential of neuroprotection, neurorecovery, and neurofacilitation to enhance recovery after TBI. Citicoline has a favorable side-effect profile in humans and several meta-analyses suggest a benefit <b>of</b> <b>citicoline</b> treatment in stroke and dementia. COBRIT is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center trial of the effects of 90 days <b>of</b> <b>citicoline</b> on functional outcome in patients with complicated mild, moderate, and severe TBI. In all, 1292 patients will be recruited over an estimated 32 months from eight clinical sites with random assignment to citicoline (1000 [*]mg twice a day) or placebo (twice a day), administered enterally or orally. Functional outcomes are assessed at 30, 90, and 180 days after the day of randomization. The primary outcome consists of a set of measures that will be analyzed as a composite measure using a global test procedure at 90 days. The measures comprise the following core battery: the California Verbal Learning Test II; the Controlled Oral Word Association Test; Digit Span; Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale; the Processing Speed Index; Stroop Test part 1 and Stroop Test part 2; and Trail Making Test parts A and B. Secondary outcomes include survival, toxicity, and rate of recovery...|$|R
40|$|Pharmacological {{treatment}} of cerebrovascular disorders was introduced {{at the beginning}} of the 20 th Century. Since then, a multitude of studies have focused on the development of a consensus for a well defined taxonomy of these disorders and on the identification of specific patterns of cognitive deficits associated with them, but with no clear consensus. Nevertheless, citicoline has proved to be a valid treatment in patients with a cerebrovascular pathogenesis for memory disorders. A metanalysis performed on the entire database available from the clinical studies performed with this compound confirms the experimental evidence from the animal studies which have repeatedly described the multiple biological actions <b>of</b> <b>citicoline</b> in restoring both the cell lipid structures and some neurotransmitter functions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Cytidine 51 -diphosphocholine or {{citicoline}} is an endogenous {{compound that}} {{acts in the}} biosynthetic pathway of phospholipids of cell membranes, particularly phosphatidylcholine, and {{it is able to}} increase neurotrasmitters levels in the central nervous system. Citicoline has shown positive effects in Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease, as well as in amblyopia. Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease currently considered a disease involving ocular and visual brain structures. Neuroprotection has been proposed as a valid therapeutic option for those patients progressing despite a well-controlled intraocular pressure, the main risk factor for the progression of the disease. The aim of this review is to critically summarize the current evidence about the effect <b>of</b> <b>citicoline</b> in glaucoma...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{most common}} cause of {{physical}} disability in children is cerebral palsy. This study was aimed to evaluate the effect <b>of</b> <b>citicoline</b> in combination to physiotherapy versus physiotherapy alone, to improve the functional outcome in pediatric cerebral palsy. Methods: The clinical trial was performed on 50 pediatric patients aged 18 - 75 months with spastic diplegia or quadriplegic cerebral palsy. Patients were assessed in two groups: case group, under treatment, using injection <b>of</b> <b>citicoline</b> (10 mg/kg) every other day for 3 months and physiotherapy. Gross motor function classification system (GMFCS) levels were assessed in all patients before and after treatment. Results: Patient′s mean age was 38. 7 ± 17. 2 months, and 52 % were girls. Differences in the frequency of GMFCS levels between groups were not statistically significant, before (P = 0. 09) and after (P = 0. 47) treatment. In case group improving in GMFCS, level was occurred in 9 / 11 with level 2 to level 1, 3 / 5 with level 3 to other levels and 3 / 7 with level 4 to other levels. In the control group improving in GMFCS, level was occurred in 3 / 9 with level 2 to level 1, 3 / 10 with level 3 to other levels, and 2 / 4 with level 4 other levels. GMFCS level in 64 % of cases was improved, whereas in control group, 32 % was improved (P = 0. 02). Conclusions: Results demonstrated that citicoline in combination to physiotherapy appears to be a promising agent to improve gross motor function in patients with cerebral palsy versus physiotherapy alone.
