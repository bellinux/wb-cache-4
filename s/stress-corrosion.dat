50|$|The high {{nickel and}} {{molybdenum}} {{contents of the}} AL-6XN alloy give it good resistance to chloride <b>stress-corrosion</b> cracking. The molybdenum confers resistance to chloride pitting. The nitrogen content serves to further increase pitting resistance and also gives it higher strength than typical 300 series austenitic stainless steels, and thereby often allows it {{to be used in}} thinner sections.|$|E
50|$|Alloy 20 (Carpenter 20) is an {{austenitic}} stainless steel possessing excellent resistance to hot sulfuric acid and many other aggressive environments which would readily attack type 316 stainless. This alloy exhibits superior resistance to <b>stress-corrosion</b> cracking in boiling 20-40% sulfuric acid. Alloy 20 has excellent mechanical properties {{and the presence of}} niobium in the alloy minimizes the precipitation of carbides during welding.|$|E
50|$|Sheet {{assembly}} of light aircraft is accomplished predominantly with rivets of alloys 2017-T4, 2117-T4, or 2024-T4. Self-tapping sheet metal screws {{are available in}} aluminum alloys, but cadmium-plated steel screws are employed more commonly to obtain higher shear strength and driveability. Alloy 2024-T4 with an anodic coating is standard for aluminum screws, bolts, and nuts made to military specifications. Alloy 6262-T9, however, is superior for nuts, because of its virtual immunity to <b>stress-corrosion</b> cracking.|$|E

Structural metal fatigue was the problem in a major wing spar. Alloy 7075-T6 was used, which is susceptible to <b>stress-corrosion</b> cracking and low toughness. The airliner was grounded and modifications were made. The wing components were redesigned and the engines replaced. The changed type was designated the Martin 2-0-2A.|$|E

50|$|Season {{cracking}} {{is a form}} of <b>stress-corrosion</b> cracking {{of brass}} cartridge cases originally reported from British forces in India. During the monsoon season, military activity was temporarily reduced, and ammunition was stored in stables until the dry weather returned. Many brass cartridges were subsequently found to be cracked, especially where the case was crimped to the bullet. It was not until 1921 that the phenomenon was explained by Moor, Beckinsale and Mallinson: ammonia from horse urine, combined with the residual stress in the cold-drawn metal of the cartridges, was responsible for the cracking.|$|E
50|$|The {{corrosion}} resistance of Monel alloy K-500 is substantially {{equivalent to that}} of alloy 400 except that, when in the age-hardened condition, alloy K-500 has a greater tendency toward <b>stress-corrosion</b> cracking in some environments. Monel alloy K-500 {{has been found to}} be resistant to a sour-gas environment. The combination of very low corrosion rates in high-velocity sea water and high strength make alloy K-500 particularly suitable for shafts of centrifugal pumps in marine service. In stagnant or slow-moving sea water, fouling may occur followed by pitting, but this pitting slows down after a fairly rapid initial attack.|$|E
50|$|In {{materials}} {{where the}} maximum applied-stress-intensity factor exceeds the <b>stress-corrosion</b> cracking-threshold value, stress corrosion adds to crack-growth velocity. This {{is shown in}} the schematic on the right. In a corrosive environment, the crack grows due to cyclic loading at a lower stress-intensity range; above the threshold stress intensity for stress corrosion cracking, additional crack growth (the red line) occurs due to SCC. The lower stress-intensity regions are not affected, and the threshold stress-intensity range for fatigue-crack propagation is unchanged in the corrosive environment. In the most-general case, corrosion-fatigue crack growth may exhibit both of the above effects; crack-growth behavior is represented in the schematic on the left.|$|E
5000|$|For {{much of the}} Victorian [...] "age of steam", {{the only}} {{material}} used for boilermaking was the highest grade of wrought iron, with assembly by rivetting. This iron was often obtained from specialist ironworks, such as at Cleator Moor (UK), noted for the high quality of their rolled plate and its suitability for high-reliability use in critical applications, such as high-pressure boilers. In the 20th century, design practice instead moved towards the use of steel, which is stronger and cheaper, with welded construction, which is quicker and requires less labour. It should be noted, however, that wrought iron boilers corrode far slower than their modern-day steel counterparts, and are less susceptible to localized pitting and <b>stress-corrosion.</b> This makes the longevity of older wrought-iron boilers far superior to those of welded steel boilers.|$|E
5000|$|Mechanochemistry or {{mechanical}} {{chemistry is}} the coupling of mechanical and chemical phenomena on a molecular scale and includes mechanical breakage, chemical behaviour of mechanically stressed solids (e.g., <b>stress-corrosion</b> cracking or enhanced oxidation), tribology, polymer degradation under shear, cavitation-related phenomena (e.g., sonochemistry and sonoluminescence), shock wave chemistry and physics, {{and even the}} burgeoning field of molecular machines. Mechanochemistry {{can be seen as}} an interface between chemistry and mechanical engineering. It is possible to synthesize chemical products by using only mechanical action. The mechanisms of mechanochemical transformations are often complex and different from usual thermal or photochemical mechanisms. The method of ball milling is a widely used process in which mechanical force is used to achieve chemical processing and transformations. The special issue of Chemical Society Review (vol. 42, 2013) is dedicated to the theme of mechanochemistry. Fundamentals and applications ranging from nano materials to technology have been reviewed.|$|E
5000|$|Superaustenitic {{stainless}} steels, such as Allegheny Ludlum alloy AL-6XN and 254SMO, exhibit great {{resistance to}} chloride pitting and crevice corrosion {{because of high}} molybdenum content (>6%) and nitrogen additions, and the higher nickel content ensures better resistance to <b>stress-corrosion</b> cracking versus the 300 series. The higher alloy content of superaustenitic steels makes them more expensive. Other steels can offer similar performance at lower cost and are preferred in certain applications. For example ASTM A387 is used in pressure vessels but is a low-alloy carbon steel with a chromium content of 0.5% to 9%. Low-carbon versions, for example 316L or 304L, are used to avoid corrosion problems caused by welding. Grade 316LVM is preferred where biocompatibility is required (such as body implants and piercings). The [...] "L" [...] means that the carbon content of the alloy is below 0.03%, which reduces the sensitization effect (precipitation of chromium carbides at grain boundaries) caused by the high temperatures involved in welding.|$|E
5000|$|The {{important}} {{characteristic of}} these tests is that the strain rate is low, for example extension rates selected {{in the range from}} 10−8 to 10−3 s−1. The selection of the strain rate is very important because the susceptibility to cracking may not be evident from result of tests at too low or too high strain rate. For numerous material-environment systems, strain rates in range 10−5 - 10−6 s−1 are used; however, the observed absence of cracking at a given strain rate should not be taken as a proof of immunity to cracking. There are known cases wherein the susceptibility to <b>stress-corrosion</b> cracking only became evident at strain rates as low as 10−8 or 10−9 s−1. Nevertheless, the method is very suitable for mechanistic studies, as well as for relative ranking of susceptibility to cracking of different alloys, or the aggressiveness of environments and the effect of temperature, pH, metallurgical condition etc.The fastest strain rate that will still promote SCC for a given environment-material system is sometimes called the [...] "critical strain rate", some values are given in the table: ...|$|E
50|$|In true {{corrosion}} fatigue, the fatigue-crack-growth rate {{is enhanced}} by corrosion; this effect is seen in all three regions of the fatigue-crack growth-rate diagram. The diagram {{on the left is}} a schematic of crack-growth rate under true corrosion fatigue; the curve shifts to a lower stress-intensity-factor range in the corrosive environment. The threshold is lower (and the crack-growth velocities higher) at all stress-intensity factors. Specimen fracture occurs when the stress-intensity-factor range is equal to the applicable threshold-stress-intensity factor for <b>stress-corrosion</b> cracking. When attempting to analyze the effects of corrosion fatigue on crack growth in a particular, both corrosion type and fatigue load levels affect crack growth in varying degrees. Common types of corrosion include filiform, pitting, exfoliation, intergranular; each will affect crack growth in a particular material in a distinct way. For instance, pitting will often be the most damaging type of corrosion, degrading a material's performance (by increasing the crack-growth rate) more than any other kind of corrosion; even pits of the order of a material's grain size may substantially degrade a material. The degree to which corrosion affects crack-growth rates also depends on fatigue-load levels; for instance, corrosion can cause a greater increase in crack-growth rates at a low loads than it does at a high load.|$|E

40|$|Various {{concepts}} {{were evaluated}} for protecting titanium alloys from oxygen contamination at 922 K (1200 F) and from hot-salt <b>stress-corrosion</b> at 755 K (900 F). It is indicated that oxygen-contamination resistance {{can be provided}} {{by a number of}} systems, but for hot-salt <b>stress-corrosion</b> resistance, factors such as coating integrity become very important. Titanium aluminides resist oxygen ingress at 922 K through the formation of alumina (on TiAl 3) or modified TiO 2 (on Ti 3 Al, TiAl) scales. TiAl has some resistance to attack by hot salt, but has limited ductility.

For designing spacecraft structures that are free of <b>stress-corrosion</b> cracking for the service life of the vehicle the following rules apply: (1) identification and control of the environments to which the structure will be exposed during construction, storage, transportation, and use; (2) selection of alloy compositions and tempers which are resistant to <b>stress-corrosion</b> cracking in the identified environment; (3) control of fabrication and other processes which may introduce residual tensile stresses or damage the material; (4) limitation of the combined residual and applied tensile stresses to below the threshold stress level for the onset of cracking throughout the service life of the vehicle; and (5) establishment of a thorough inspection program...|$|E

The <b>stress-corrosion</b> cracking property was evaluated by the decrease ratio of maximum stress and elongation of the Al-Mg alloy with NaCl solution, (max) and (), respectively. (max) and () were lower with ECAP than without it, showing that the susceptibility of <b>stress-corrosion</b> cracking decreased with ECAP. The polarization curve and time dependence of the anodic current density at constant potential of the Al-Mg alloy in the NaCl solution revealed that the anodic current density was lower with ECAP than without it, or the corrosion resistance of the Al-Mg alloy was improved by ECAP. The decrease in <b>stress-corrosion</b> crack susceptibility of the Al-Mg alloy with ECAP is attributed to an improvement in corrosion resistance afforded by ECAP...|$|E

40|$|Evaluations are {{presented}} of potential coating systems for protection of titanium alloys from hot-salt <b>stress-corrosion</b> up to temperatures of 755 K (900 F) and from oxidation embrittlement up to temperature of 922 K (1200 F). Diffusion type coatings containing Si, Al, Cr, Ni or Fe as single coating elements or in various combinations were evaluated for oxidation protection, hot-salt <b>stress-corrosion</b> (HSSC) resistance, effects on tensile properties, fatigue properties, erosion resistance and ballistic impact resistance on an alpha and beta phase titanium alloy (Ti- 6 Al- 2 Sn- 4 Zr- 2 Mo). All of the coatings investigated demonstrated excellent oxidation protectiveness, {{but none of}} the coatings provided protection from hot-salt <b>stress-corrosion.</b> Experimental results indicated that both the aluminide and silicide types of coatings actually decreased the HSSC resistance of the substrate alloy.

40|$|The {{basic problem}} of main {{pipelines}} non-destructive examination is {{reliability and validity}} of obtained parameters of flaws (including <b>stress-corrosion</b> cracks). One of the most rapid and efficient NDT techniques for main pipelines is the method of magnetic flux leak (MFL) over defect. In accordance with magnetic method canon- the examination reliability (that is probability of crack detection starting from some preset threshold level) is a multiparameter task. The MFL technique is widely used for detection of internal and external <b>stress-corrosion.</b> The instruments implementing MFL method provide magnetization of pipeline wall material up to the technical saturation level; after that the magnetic filed flux leak is registered by magnetic field sensors. <b>Stress-corrosion</b> and corrosion like defects present in the pipeline wall are detected based on information picked up from those sensors. The difficulty in this case is the fact that basic measured parameter is subjected to impacts of numerous factors including material sensitivity towards magnetization, types of sensors and there location, pipeline wall thickness, the gap between pipeline surface and measuring element, etc. The magnetic instruments, as a rule, comprise: magnetic module inducing magnetic field in the pipeline wall; sensors placed between magnets at certain distance from each other. If it is required to evaluate the depth of the <b>stress-corrosion</b> crack the number of sensors and distance between them should be determined. Also it is necessary to evaluate and determine the distance between neighboring <b>stress-corrosion</b> cracks making it possible to differentiate them. In the paper posed is the problem and discussed are approaches of its solution, i. e. how to define the sufficient number of sensors to detect peak signal amplitude that can be correlated to the depth of <b>stress-corrosion</b> crack and how to determine minimal distances between cracks for which the last ones can be differentiated.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} was {{to develop}} models of fatigue crack growth and <b>stress-corrosion</b> cracking by investigating cohesive theories of fracture. These models were integrated in a finite-element framework embedding a contact algorithm and techniques of remeshing and adaptive meshing. For the fatigue model, we developed a phenomenological cohesive law which exhibits unloading-reloading hysteresis. This model qualitatively predicts fatigue crack growth rates in metals under constant amplitude regime for short and long cracks, as well as growth retardation due to overload. Quantitative predictions were obtained {{in the case of}} long cracks. We developed a chemistry-dependent cohesive law which serves as a basis for the <b>stress-corrosion</b> cracking model. In order to determine this cohesive law, two approaches, based on energy relaxation and the renormalization group, were used for coarse-graining interplanar potentials.
