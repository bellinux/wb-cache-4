40|$|Behind piers across spillway, <b>super</b> <b>critical</b> <b>flow</b> generates {{standing}} waves known as rooster tails. One {{of the most}} important parameter which has to be evaluated is the height of rooster tail. In fact, high rooster tails, especially occurring close to the side walls, increases the construction cost, as countermeasures to contain them have to be adopted. In this study, the scale model of the El Chaparral dam, with a downstream chute expansion of 50 ° slope, has been used and the maximum flood was simulated. Experiments have been done with different angles of vertical deflectors for different Froude numbers. The aim of the paper was to optimize the angle of vertical deflectors to minimize rooster tail height...|$|E

By using neutron radiography, Peterson et al. have studied salt precipitation processes in supercritical water and the flow pattern in a reverse-flow vessel for salt precipitation, and Balasko et al. have revealed the behaviour of supercritical water in a container.

40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of thermal {{conduction}} on the observational properties of a <b>super</b> <b>critical</b> hot magnetized <b>flow.</b> We obtained self-similar solution of a magnetized disc when the thermal conduction plays an important role. Follow of our first paper (Ghasemnezhad et al. 2012 (hereafter GKA 12)) we have extended our solution on the observational appearance of the disc to show how physical condition such as thermal conduction, viscosity, and advection will change the observed luminosity of the disc, Continuous spectra and surface temperature of such discs was plotted. We apply the present model to black-hole X-ray binary LMC X- 3 and narrow-line seyfert 1 galaxies, which are supposed to be under critical accretion rate. Our results show clearly that the surface temperature is strongly depends on the thermal conduction, the magnetic field and advection parameter. However we see that thermal conduction acts to oppose the temperature gradient as we expect and observed luminosity of the disc will reduce when thermal conduction is high. We have shown that in this model the spectra of <b>critical</b> accretion <b>flows</b> strongly depends on the inclination angle. Comment: Accepted for publication, AP&S...|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} of subaqueous slopes is often studied {{to determine the}} probability of failure of hydraulic structures. Slope failures have been widely studied to increase the understanding of this complex failure mechanism. However, after a failure it is often {{hard to figure out}} the type of failure mechanism: static liquefaction or breach flow. Densely packed soil show dilatant behavior when its subjected to shear, and therefore its stability is temporarily guaranteed. The slope gradual loses grains, which may initiate turbidity currents. This current can be accelerated over the entire slope, until far downstream the flow decelerates (decreased gravitational force and the bed friction) and settles eventually. 1 D-equations are derived from conservation of mass and momentum along slopes, which results in an adaptation with respect to the equations of Mastbergen (2013) in the model HMBreach, namely the system is extended to non-stationary conditions. The 1 D equations are the framework of the numerical model: BreachFlow. A first order upwind scheme is applied and the transition equations from Eke, Viparelli, & Parker (2011) form the boundary at the breach. This boundary provides initial conditions of thickness, velocity and density and are based on breach height, like in HMBreach and therefore change when the breach retrogrades in time. Due to the chosen numerical scheme hydraulic jumps cause errors when <b>super</b> <b>critical</b> <b>flows</b> decelerate and become sub-critical. Therefore, sedimentation cannot be modelled and the final slope is not found. However, several time steps at the toe of the breach can be modelled and provide information about the development of the breach height, which is important for the initial condition at the first grid point. In conclusion, with BreachFlow is not yet possible to model the entire final slope, when the breach height reduces to zero. However, it is compared to HMBreach/HMTurb and Retrobreach a promising model, which is easy to adapt to different parameters (including profile) and more accurate regarding the calculation of three variables instead of one (transport of sand). Future work should be based on the implementation of a higher order explicit scheme or even an implicit scheme, in order to model the sedimentation. Then the model can be compared to several case studies including tidal flat of Walsoorden (Van den Ham et al, 2015) in order gain insight what type of mechanism occurred and what parameters correspond to the final slope and retrogressive length.

In this thesis, {{we focus}} on the {{bandwidth}} allocation on the bottleneck link and provide several allocation schemes to minimize the potential damage caused by flooding attacks. Assume that we know which <b>flows</b> are <b>critical</b> <b>flows,</b> and all other flows on the bottleneck link are considered as suspicious flows [4], when the delivery path is under attacks. The proposed schemes try to provide more bandwidth to <b>critical</b> <b>flows</b> and reduce damages as much as possible. Using these schemes, the system can properly allocate the bandwidth among <b>critical</b> <b>flows</b> and suspicious flows on the bottleneck link. At the same time, the congestion of the bottleneck link will be identified and the non-critical flows are tagged as suspicious flows. Once the congestion of the bottleneck link is identified, the bandwidth allocation of suspicious flows is reduced based on the proposed methods. In other words, we can supply proper bandwidth to <b>critical</b> <b>flows,</b> such that <b>critical</b> <b>flows</b> will suffer less damage. Ideally, if a suspicious flow can be determined as an attack flow, this flow will be dropped completely. As a result, the whole system will suffer less damage...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{estimate}} myocardial oxygen needs {{by studying}} the effects of reduced coronary blood flow on segmental myocardial function. To study the tolerance of limited oxygen supply to a myocardial segment during propofol administration. DESIGN: A prospective experimental study. SETTING: An experimental animal laboratory in a university. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen adult dogs, weighing 20 to 35 kg. INTERVENTIONS: Open thorax open pericardium experiments were performed under standard anesthetic conditions. Segment length gauges were placed subendocardially in an anteroapical and in a basal segment. Flow to the anteroapical segment was reduced by tightening a micrometer-controlled snare placed around the second diagonal coronary artery. Left ventricular pressure-length signals allowed for identification of onset of relaxation dysfunction. Myocardial tissue flow at onset of relaxation dysfunction was defined as <b>critical</b> <b>flow.</b> Tracer microspheres were used to measure subepicardial, midwall, and subendocardial <b>flow</b> at <b>critical</b> <b>flow.</b> MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Stability of the model and reproducibility of <b>critical</b> <b>flow</b> were studied in a first series of six dogs with the hearts paced at 110 beats/min. Hemodynamics, left ventricular, and segmental myocardial function during <b>critical</b> <b>flow</b> were stable. Subendocardial <b>critical</b> <b>flow</b> was identical with each flow reduction (45 % +/- 5, 44 % +/- 8, and 43 % +/- 5 of baseline myocardial tissue flow). In a second series of six dogs, <b>critical</b> <b>flow</b> was measured at pacing rates 100 beats/min, 150 beats/min, and 100 beats/min with propranolol, 0. 1 mg/kg, pretreatment. <b>Critical</b> <b>flows</b> were 38 % +/- 5, 55 % +/- 6, and 17 % +/- 2 of baseline, respectively (p < 0. 05). In a third series of six dogs, <b>critical</b> <b>flow</b> was measured during sufentanil, 0. 6 microgram/kg/min, and increasing doses of propofol (P 0 : 0. 0 mg/kg/h, P 4 : 4. 0 mg/kg/h and P 8 : 8. 0 mg/kg/h). Heart rate was kept constant at 110 beats/min. When compared with P 0, hemodynamic and left ventricular contraction parameters were stable at P 4 but were decreased at P 8. At P 0, <b>critical</b> <b>flow</b> was: 0. 63 +/- 0. 14, at P 4 : 0. 34 +/- 0. 09, and at P 8 : 0. 25 +/- 0. 07 mL/min/g (p < 0. 05).
