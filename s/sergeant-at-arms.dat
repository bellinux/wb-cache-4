25|$|Women {{were not}} allowed to wear {{trousers}} on the US Senate floor until 1993. In 1993, Senators Barbara Mikulski and Carol Moseley Braun wore trousers onto the floor in defiance of the rule, and female support staff followed soon after, with the rule being amended later that year by Senate <b>Sergeant-at-Arms</b> Martha Pope to allow women to wear trousers on the floor so long as they also wore a jacket.|$|E
25|$|On October 22, 2014, several {{shooting}} incidents occurred around Parliament Hill. A gunman, after fatally {{shooting a}} Canadian Army soldier mounting the ceremonial {{guard at the}} National War Memorial, moved to the Centre Block of the parliament buildings. There, {{he was killed in}} a shootout with RCMP officers and the <b>Sergeant-At-Arms,</b> Kevin Vickers. The gunman also injured one House of Commons constable, who was shot in the foot.|$|E
25|$|The BCYP {{itself is}} led by a cabinet {{appointed}} by the Premier-elect. The Premier-elect also appoints various other officers, such as a Lieutenant Governor, a Speaker, a chief clerk, and a <b>Sergeant-At-Arms,</b> among others. The legislative year for a Premier and their cabinet runs from October 1 to September 30 of the following year. The Premier and Cabinet plan the government’s legislative plan and prepare the bills for consideration at the December sitting of the BCYP.|$|E
25|$|Officers in {{undergraduate}} chapters mostly have titles derived from Imperial Rome. The top officers of each chapter {{are known as}} the Consul (president), Pro Consul (vice-president), Annotator (minute-taker), Quaestor (treasurer), Magister (pledge trainer), Kustos (<b>sergeant-at-arms),</b> Tribune (communications), and Historian. Those titles are the primary officers common to all chapters. Chapters also have other positions, such as Social Chairman, Sports Chairman, Scholarship Chairman, House Manager, Rush Chairman, etc., plus other positions and titles varying from chapter to chapter.|$|E
25|$|The Bandidos {{reportedly}} {{declared war}} on the Hells Angels after an ambush on several Bandidos members outside the affiliated Diablos' clubhouse in Melton, Melbourne on March 1, 2013 in which over 30 shots were fired and two men, including Bandidos national <b>sergeant-at-arms</b> Toby Mitchell, were wounded. The Hells Angels Nomads chapter were blamed for the attack and brothers Daniel and Ben Pegoraro, both members of Hells Angels puppet club the Red Devils, were questioned by police. Within a week of the shooting, a clubhouse in Bendigo linked to the Hells Angels was burned down and the Pegoraro brothers' home in Epping, Melbourne was attacked in a drive-by shooting. Although prolonged violence was expected, the feud seemingly ended after {{senior members of the}} two clubs held peace talks.|$|E
25|$|In 2003 {{the society}} held a {{constitutional}} convention that updated the original document, adjusting {{the organization to}} suit changes that {{had happened in the}} previous 200 years, such as co-education. Nonetheless, the society has retained its traditional forms and rituals almost in their entirety. Philolexian has several officers, the Moderator (de facto president), Scriba, and Censor (emeritus president), as well as other enviable positions, including Herald, Keeper of the Halls, Chancellor of the Exchequer, <b>Sergeant-at-Arms,</b> Whip, Minister of Internet Truth, Nomenclaturist-General, Symposiarch, and Literary Czar, editor of the literary journal of the Society. These titles are derived from the roles performed at the meeting, at which the Moderator leads debate, the Scriba records minutes, and the Censor adds his or her views about the debates, censuring or commending members as necessary.|$|E

500|$|The Speaker of the Rhodesian parliament, ARW Stumbles, reconvened the Legislative Assembly on 25 November, resolving {{that if he}} did {{not there}} would be chaos. He feared that Gibbs might {{dramatically}} walk into the chamber in an attempt to stop the proceedings, but Gibbs did no such thing. The parliamentary opposition opened the meeting by asking whether the assembly was legal. Ahrn Palley, the lone white opposition MP, announced that as he saw it, [...] "certain Honourable Members in collusion have torn up the constitution under which this House meets. The proceedings have no legal validity whatsoever". Stumbles overruled this objection and two more interruptions from Palley, and suggested that any members with reservations might leave. Palley continued his loud protests until he was forcibly ejected by the <b>Sergeant-at-Arms,</b> shouting [...] "This is an illegal assembly! God save the Queen!" [...] Gondo and eight other opposition MPs followed Palley out; all ten of them rejoined the Legislative Assembly in February 1966.|$|E
500|$|Male {{survivors}} of the massacre {{have been subjected to}} criticism for not intervening to stop Lépine. In an interview immediately after the event, a reporter asked one of the men why they [...] "abandoned" [...] the women when it was clear that Lépine's targets were women. [...] René Jalbert, the <b>sergeant-at-arms</b> who persuaded Denis Lortie to surrender during his 1984 attack, said that someone should have intervened at least to distract Lépine, but acknowledged that [...] "ordinary citizens cannot be expected to react heroically in the midst of terror." [...] Newspaper columnist Mark Steyn suggested that male inaction during the massacre illustrated a [...] "culture of passivity" [...] prevalent among men in Canada, which enabled Lépine's shooting spree: [...] "Yet the defining image of contemporary Canadian maleness is not M Lepine/Gharbi but the professors and the men in that classroom, who, ordered to leave by the lone gunman, meekly did so, and abandoned their female classmates to their fate—an act of abdication that would have been unthinkable in almost any other culture throughout human history." ...|$|E
500|$|The Royal Assent {{ceremony}} {{takes place}} in the Senate, as the sovereign is traditionally barred from the House of Commons. On the day of the event, the Speaker of the Senate will read to the chamber a notice from the secretary to the governor general indicating when the viceroy or a deputy thereof will arrive. The Senate thereafter cannot adjourn until after the ceremony. The speaker moves to sit beside the throne, the Mace Bearer, with mace in hand, stands adjacent to him or her, and the governor general enters to take the speaker's chair. The Usher of the Black Rod is then commanded by the speaker to summon the members of parliament, who follow Black Rod back to the Senate, the <b>Sergeant-at-Arms</b> carrying the mace of the House of Commons. In the Senate, those from the commons stand behind the bar, while Black Rod proceeds to stand next to the governor general, who then nods his or her head to signify Royal Assent to the presented bills (which do not include appropriations bills). Once the list of bills is complete, the Clerk of the Senate states: [...] "in Her Majesty's name, His [...] Excellency the Governor General [...] doth assent to these bills." [...] If there are any appropriation bills to receive Royal Assent, the Speaker of the House of Commons will read their titles and the Senate clerk repeats them to the governor general, who nods his or her head to communicate Royal Assent. When these bills have all been assented to, the Clerk of the Senate recites [...] "in Her Majesty's name, His [...] Excellency the Governor General [...] thanks her loyal subjects, accepts their benevolence and assents to these bills." [...] The governor general or his or her deputy then depart parliament.|$|E

2500|$|Byrd {{also was}} known for using his {{knowledge}} of parliamentary procedure. Byrd frustrated Republicans with his encyclopedic knowledge of {{the inner workings of}} the Senate, particularly prior to the Reagan Revolution. From 1977 to 1979 he was described as [...] "performing a procedural tap dance around the minority, outmaneuvering Republicans with his mastery of the Senate's arcane rules." [...] In 1988, majority leader Byrd moved a call of the Senate, which was adopted by the majority present, in order to have the <b>Sergeant-at-Arms</b> arrest members not in attendance. One member (Robert Packwood, R-Oregon) was escorted back to the chamber by the <b>Sergeant-at-Arms</b> in order to obtain a quorum.|$|E
2500|$|By {{virtue of}} these {{provisions}} of the 1987 Philippine Constitution, the Senate adopts its own rules, otherwise known as the [...] "Rules of the Senate."

At McKinley, Conzelman was the quarterback of the football team, competed on the basketball and track teams, {{was president of the}} boys' athletic association, and served as <b>sergeant-at-arms</b> of the Class of 1916. [...] He led the 1915 McKinley football team to a league championship.|$|E
2500|$|In 1862, he {{was again}} elected {{district}} attorney. He {{seems to have}} moved into Monroe at about this time, as he was elected as a Village [...] "trustee" [...] (city council member) in 1862-1864. In 1866, {{he was elected to}} the first school board for the village. In 1869, Gardner was an unsuccessful candidate for county judge. In 1873 he was again elected a village trustee, as well as chairman of the board of trustees. In 1876, he served as <b>Sergeant-at-Arms</b> for the State Senate.|$|E
2500|$|On January 7, 1920, {{less than}} a week after the Palmer Raids had swept and stunned the country, a new session of the New York State Assembly was called to order. The {{majority}} Republicans easily elected their candidate for the Speaker, Thaddeus C. Sweet and after opening day formalities the body took a brief recess. Back in session, Sweet declared: [...] "The Chair directs the <b>Sergeant-at-Arms</b> to present before the Bar of the House Samuel A. DeWitt, Samuel Orr, Louis Waldman, Charles Solomon, and August Claessens", the Assembly's five Socialist members.|$|E
2500|$|Peter John [...] "Skitzo" [...] Hewat, <b>sergeant-at-arms</b> of the Hells Angels' East County {{chapter in}} Campbellfield, Melbourne, {{was arrested in}} March 2013 after {{striking}} a 64-year-old woman during a dispute over his dog, and was again arrested that October {{as part of a}} statewide raid targeting the Hells Angels in which thirteen people were arrested and weapons and drugs were seized. Hewat was sentenced to 10 months in jail in January 2014 after he pleaded guilty to assault, weapons offences, handling stolen goods and operating a tow truck without the proper licence.|$|E
2500|$|The premier, Sir John Forrest, {{was furious}} about the report {{because of its}} {{potential}} effect on investment in the state. [...] The government subsequently sued the proprietors of the Kalgoorlie Miner for publishing a libel, but the case was unsuccessful. [...] Forrest then ordered Colebatch to be barred from the press gallery. [...] On 19October, the <b>sergeant-at-arms</b> forcibly ejected Colebatch and, the following day, the latter indicated his intention to sue for assault. [...] Colebatch subsequently received plenty of support in the House from members who {{felt that he had}} been unfairly treated; and, shortly afterwards, his suspension was lifted.|$|E

In a fit of rage, the flamboyant Wall attempted to pull out a pistol from a boot holster. He was stopped by the <b>sergeant-at-arms</b> and Representative John C. Ensminger of Monroe from harming Gunter or any other colleague. Gunter was visibly shaken. When Representative Ron Gomez of Lafayette told him that Wall {{did not mean to}} harm him, Gunter replied with tears in his eyes, [...] "It ain't all right. Nobody pulls a gun on me and gets away with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rather than await trial, Blount posted bail {{and fled}} to Tennessee. [...] John Chisholm {{remained}} in England in a debtors' prison for several months, and confessed the entire scheme upon his return.

[...] The House continued to consider evidence for Blount's impeachment in early 1798. [...] At one session on January 30, a bizarre brawl erupted between two congressmen, Matthew Lyon and Roger Griswold. [...] Blount's trial in the Senate took place in January 1799, though Blount refused to attend, in spite of a visit to Knoxville from the Senate <b>sergeant-at-arms.</b> [...] On January 11, 1799, the Senate voted 14 to 11 to dismiss the impeachment, arguing that impeachment did not extend to senators.|$|E
2500|$|Brownlow {{began calling}} {{for civil rights}} to be {{extended}} to freed slaves, stating that [...] "a loyal Negro was more deserving than a disloyal white man." [...] In May 1866, he submitted the 14th Amendment for ratification, which the Radicals in Congress supported, but Johnson and his allies opposed. [...] The Pro-Johnson minority in the state house attempted to flee Nashville to prevent a quorum, and the House <b>sergeant-at-arms</b> was dispatched to arrest them. [...] Two were captured Pleasant Williams and A.J. Martin and confined to the House committee room, giving the House the necessary number of members present to establish a quorum. [...] After the amendment passed by a 43-11 vote, Heiskell refused to sign it and resigned in protest. [...] His successor signed it, however, and the amendment was ratified. [...] In transmitting the news to Congress, Brownlow taunted Johnson, stating, [...] "My compliments to the dead dog in the White House." [...] Tennessee was readmitted to the Union shortly afterward.|$|E
2500|$|In 1863, Saulsbury was a vehement {{critic of}} President Abraham Lincoln's administration. [...] Opposing {{the war in}} general and the {{suspension}} of habeas corpus specifically, Saulsbury attempted to prevent a vote sustaining that controversial executive order. [...] Apparently intoxicated, Saulsbury verbally attacked the President on the Senate floor in what John Hay described as [...] "language fit only for a drunken fishwife". [...] Senator Saulsbury called Lincoln [...] "an imbecile" [...] and stated that the President was [...] "the weakest man ever placed in a high office". [...] When Vice President Hannibal Hamlin called Saulsbury to order, the Senator refused to take his seat. [...] Finally, the Senate's <b>sergeant-at-arms</b> approached to remove Saulsbury from the Senate floor when the Senator suddenly brandished a revolver, placed it against the sergeant's head and said, [...] "Damn you, if you touch me I'll shoot you dead!" [...] Eventually, Saulsbury was calmed and removed from the Senate floor.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, Zehaf-Bibeau {{reached an}} alcove by the {{entrance}} to the Library of Parliament, and hid out of sight of RCMP officers, who ordered him to drop his gun and surrender. The location of the alcove is near the office of the <b>Sergeant-at-Arms</b> of the House of Commons, Kevin Vickers. Vickers, a distinguished policeman, commander and administrator with the RCMP before he joined the staff of the House of Commons in 2005, obtained a 9mm handgun from a lock-box and entered the hall. Vickers' security team, which had been chasing Zehaf-Bibeau, yelled to Vickers that the suspect was hiding in the alcove. Vickers immediately ran behind {{the other side of a}} nearby column, then dove past the column and fired upward at Zehaf-Bibeau. [...] Witnesses and reports show RCMP Constable Curtis Barrett, leading the tactical formation, fired the shot that killed Zehaf-Bibeau after Bibeau fired in his direction. CBC television cameras on the scene recorded over 30 shots fired in the final gunfight. Footage showed a group of RCMP officers converging near the alcove; two loud gunshots are heard, then a large number of gunshots in rapid succession, then silence.|$|E

60|$|Quickly Lonny {{pulled up}} his pony, and rounded the pillars. Spectators came running, too astounded to add {{speech to the}} commotion. The <b>sergeant-at-arms</b> of the House came forth, frowned, looked ominous, and then grinned. Many of the legislators crowded out to observe the tumult. Lonny's cowpunchers were {{stricken}} to silent horror by his mad deed.|$|E
60|$|It is true {{he had no}} {{effective}} recourse. He had an official called an 'Ordner,' whose help he could invoke in desperate cases, but apparently the Ordner is only a persuader, not a compeller. Apparently he is a <b>sergeant-at-arms</b> who is not loaded; a good enough gun to look at, but not valuable for business.|$|E
60|$|There {{is nothing}} of {{consequence}} new here. Congress is to organize to-morrow. Last night we held a Whig caucus for the House, and nominated Winthrop of Massachusetts for speaker, Sargent of Pennsylvania for <b>sergeant-at-arms,</b> Homer of New Jersey door-keeper, and McCormick of District of Columbia postmaster. The Whig {{majority in the}} House is so small that, together with some little dissatisfaction, [it] leaves it doubtful whether we will elect them all.|$|E
60|$|Give me a chance. Get me the thanks of Congress. Don't {{wait for}} others; there isn't time. I have stayed away and let Congress alone for seventy-one years and I am {{entitled}} to thanks.

Send me an order on the <b>Sergeant-at-Arms</b> quick. When shall I come? With love and a benediction.|$|E
