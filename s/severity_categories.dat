Pre-fire tree size classes showed a distinct pattern among <b>severity</b> <b>categories.</b> Small-tree density tended to be initially higher in plots that burned with greater fire severity (Figure 6).

30|$|User’s and producer’s {{accuracies}} for low {{and middle}} <b>severity</b> <b>categories</b> were low {{for at least}} two reasons (Table 4). First, in most of the low and middle categories, there were {{more than twice as many}} plots < 30 m from mapped category boundaries compared to the number of plots ≥ 30 m distant from boundaries (Table 2). It is therefore important to consider the registration accuracy of the satellite images and scale of the severity maps when using them for post-fire project planning. Plot location in relation to the boundary of the mapped severity polygons is important. Plots do not perfectly align with the 30 m satellite pixel, and as fire can transition from surface to crown within 30 m (Safford et al. 2012), fire effects can vary considerably within a pixel, resulting in lower accuracy for plots in the pixel adjacent to the edge of the polygon. The middle <b>severity</b> <b>categories</b> often occur in narrow bands around high severity patches. When the number of <b>severity</b> <b>categories</b> increases (i.e., BA 4 vs. BA 7), those bands decrease in width to only one to two pixels wide in many locations, leading to confusion between <b>severity</b> <b>categories</b> (Figure 3). Considering that pixels can be misregistered up to a pixel, it can also be impossible to identify the exact location of those moderate severity pixels on the ground. Second, mean plot values in the lowest <b>severity</b> <b>categories</b> were greater than indicated by the mapped categories (Figure 3). Kane et al. (2013) also detected tree mortality using LIDAR data in unchanged and low categories of maps calibrated to the CBI. All but two of the fires in our study occurred in areas that had not burned since at least the early 1900 s. Numerous stand composition studies throughout our study area have shown that areas that experienced frequent low- to mixed-severity pre-settlement fires have contemporary stand structures distinguished by relatively small numbers of old trees (> 300 yr) and abundant younger trees that established after fire suppression began (Vankat and Major 1978, Taylor and Skinner 2003, Leonzo and Keyes 2010, Scholl and Taylor 2010, Collins et al. 2011). Under- and mid-story trees can be killed in low intensity surface fire, which may not be detectable by a passive satellite (e.g., Landsat) under dense forest canopies (Stenback and Congalton 1990), leading to higher actual mortality measured in plots in the lower <b>severity</b> <b>categories.</b> Percent change in CC was based upon FVS calculations of pre- and post-fire live trees. The FVS estimates of CC were corrected for canopy overlap, but FVS uses random tree placement (Crookston and Stage 1999, Miller et al. 2009 a). Therefore, the percent changes in CC may not represent actual CC as seen from overhead by a satellite, thereby also leading to higher than expected CC change in the lowest <b>severity</b> <b>categories.</b> As a result, it may be more appropriate to combine the 0 % category (BA or CC) with the next higher category (Kolden et al. 2012). When the 0 % and > 0 % and < 25 % change categories are combined, user’s and producer’s accuracies increase from ≥ 26.0 % to ≥ 62.4 % (results not shown).|$|E
30|$|From a {{management}} perspective, {{it is desirable}} for the highest <b>severity</b> <b>categories</b> to be accurate because that is where most potential ecosystem damage occurs and where most post-fire management actions occur. User’s and producer’s accuracies of the high severity category ranged from 74.5 % to 86.6 %. But, more than half (54 % to 67 %) of the plots in our study were < 30 m from the boundary, between different mapped <b>severity</b> <b>categories</b> of percent change in BA (Table 2). When considering plots ≥ 30 m from the boundary, user’s and producer’s accuracies were ≥ 89.9 % (Table 4). More than 80 % of the plots ≥ 30 m from the boundary in the highest severity category had no live trees (Figure 5). As accuracy of IAs and EAs is similar, both appear to be adequate for producing broad-scale estimates and in identifying locations of complete tree mortality.|$|E

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was undertaken of patients who underwent fluoroscopic intra-articular steroid injection over the 9 -month study period. Comparative analysis of the Oxford hip pain score pre- and 6 - 8 weeks post-intra-articular injection was performed. Hip radiographs of all patients were categorised as normal, mild, moderate, or severe disease (four categories) based on the modified Kellgren-Lawrence severity scale, and improvement on the Oxford hip pain score on each of these four <b>severity</b> <b>categories</b> were assessed. RESULTS: Within the study cohort of 100 patients, the mean increase in post-procedure hip score of 7. 32 points confirms statistically significant benefits of the therapy (p< 0. 001, 95 % confidence interval: 5. 55 - 9. 09).

A small number of studies show differences in the response to diet and/or lifestyle intervention depending on the severity of disease.

Dietary changes to modify nutrient profiles, for example, the ratio of n- 3 :n- 6 fats, appear to have more potential than those that restrict specific food groups or macronutrients. Evidence suggests a combination of weight management and lycopene (30 mg per day), soy isoflavones or flaxseed supplementation may contribute to delaying prostate cancer proliferation for men on ‘active surveillance’.

Only an actuarial analysis based on a standard life table of cases of cerebral palsy will enable a valid estimate of survival. Construction of the table requires a total cohort of cases of cerebral palsy with their date of birth. Each case must conform to a specified definition of the syndrome.

She classified areas within the digitized fire history perimeters as unchanged if the severity was so low {{that she could not}} detect a change in the images that were one year post-fire, and she extended the perimeters to include areas that showed a change due to fire but were outside of the recorded perimeters.

Consulters with any of 115 morbidities classified on four ordinal scales of severity ("chronicity," "time course," "health care use," and "patient impact") were compared to all other consulters. Results: As hypothesized, in both countries, morbidity severity was associated with older age, female gender, more deprivation (all comparisons P ≤ 0. 05), and poor physical health (all trends P < 0. 001). The estimated strengths of association of poor physical health with the highest <b>severity</b> <b>category</b> expressed as odds ratios, {{for each of the four}} scales, were 5. 4 for life-threatening on the "chronicity" scale, 1. 8 for time course, 2. 8 for high health care use, and 3. 7 for high patient impact. Conclusions: Four scales of morbidity severity have been validated in English and Dutch settings, and they offer the potential to use simple routine consultation data as an indicator of physical health status in populations from general practice. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.
