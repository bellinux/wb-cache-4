40|$|Background: Physical {{activity}} declines {{during adolescence}} and strategies to combat this occurrence are both educational {{and public health}} priorities. Schools {{have been identified as}} central institutions for the promotion of physical activity among youth. While physical education is considered to be the major vehicle for physical activity promotion in the <b>school</b> setting, <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> provides another important opportunity to engage youth in physical activity. Little is known about students’ beliefs about the value of <b>school</b> <b>sport.</b> Purpose: The primary aim {{of this study was to}} explore the relationship between students’ beliefs about <b>school</b> <b>sport,</b> social support received during <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> and physical self-esteem in adolescents. Participants and setting: The sample included 249 adolescents (126 boys and 123 girls) from 10 secondary schools in New South Wales, Australia. The mean age of students was 14. 1 (± 1. 6) years. Research design: Cross-sectional. Data collection and analysis: Participants completed a detailed questionnaire assessing participation in <b>school</b> <b>sport,</b> <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> beliefs, perceived social support for <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> and physical self-esteem using the Physical Self-Perception Profile (PSPP). Independent samples t-tests were used to examine gender and age differences and hierarchical regression was used to determine the relationship between students’ <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> beliefs, social support received during <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> and physical selfesteem. Separate analyses were conducted for boys and girls. Findings: Both boys and girls considered <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> an important opportunity to be physically active. Students believed 'enjoyment’ and selecting activities with their friends were the most important reasons for selecting <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> activities. Boys reported significantly higher levels of perceived physical strength (F = 1. 58, p < 0. 05), sport competence (F = 0. 28, p < 0. 001), physical condition (F = 0. 36, p < 0. 01), body attractiveness (F = 1. 76, p < 0. 01), and physical self-worth (F = 3. 32, p < 0. 05). The model predicting boys’ beliefs about <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> explained 17 % of the variance (F = 4. 08, p < 0. 01) and the only statistically significant predictor was <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> social support (β = 0. 25, p < 0. 01). Similarly, <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> social support (β = 0. 31, p < 0. 01) was also the only significant predictor in the girls’ model which accounted for 28 % of the variance in <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> beliefs (F = 6. 46, p < 0. 001). Discussion: Students who recognised the value of <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> also reported higher levels of social support for <b>school</b> <b>sport.</b> <b>School</b> <b>sport</b> is an ideal opportunity for the promotion of physical activity and programs may be improved with increased diversity and choice for students. Furthermore, higher levels of teacher support and modelling may contribute to improved student outcomes for <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> programs...|$|R

5|$|Balukas was {{not just}} talented at pool but was an {{all-around}} good athlete. Starting at age 16, and for two other years, she was {{invited to participate in}} ABC-TV's Superstars. Held in Rotonda, Florida, the event pitted championship athletes from one sport competing in sports other than their own specialties, vying for cash prizes totaling $69,000. In her first appearance in 1976, while a junior in high school, she finished second taking titles in tennis and bowling where she won with 192 points. The winner that year was speed skater Anne Henning. Other competitors included, diver Micki King, tennis and golf pro Althea Gibson, Skier Kiki Cutter, sprinter Wyomia Tyus, and Tennis champ Martina Navratilova. The second place win was bittersweet for Balukas, because based on the award of prize money for placing at Superstars ($13,100), she lost amateur standing and was thereafter banned from competing in high <b>school</b> <b>sports,</b> also becoming no longer eligible for a college athletic scholarship.|$|E

40|$|PhD (Movement Education), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 In <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> the {{professionalisation}} {{of sport}} {{has reached the}} domain of <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> as a grassroots incubator for sporting talent and for providing positive experiences {{that might lead to}} lifelong engagement in physical activity. This has inevitably {{led to the development of}} specialised human resources required to manage <b>school</b> <b>sport.</b> In the South African context, despite the existence of a variety of sport management programmes, there is a need for continuously updated and adapted programmes to address the needs and demands of the market and workplace. To cope with the increased complexities surrounding <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> and the management thereof, a distinct body of knowledge and skills needs to be developed (Quatman & Chelladurai, 2008 a: 651) for the management of <b>school</b> <b>sport.</b> Concern over the lack of common knowledge, as well as a pertinent sport management programme for educator training to prepare educators for the diverse contemporary requirements and needs regarding the management of <b>school</b> <b>sport,</b> has resulted in current and prospective educators not necessarily meeting the needs or expectations of the industry in a diversity of South African schools to manage <b>school</b> <b>sport.</b> As a result there appears to be a gap between current sport management programmes‟ outcomes at Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) 1 in South Africa and the expected competencies of <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> managers. A need thus exists to have a sport management programme in place for educator training in accordance with the diverse needs of South African schools. Based on the preceding, the problem of identifying the needs and competencies of <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> managers required for the sport management training of educators according to the diverse context of South African schools is seen as the central point in this study. In coherence with the problem statement and the stated research questions, the purpose of this research was to determine the needs and competencies of <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> managers in order to develop a sport management programme for educator training according to the diverse needs of schools in South Africa. In order to achieve this, based on the problem statement, it was necessary to: * Determine the context of <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> within the education system; * Describe and delineate the current role of the <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> manager within the education system; * To analyse international and national sport management training programmes as part of educator training; * Determine the needs and competencies required by educators to manage <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> effectively according to the diverse needs of South African schools; and * Develop a sport management training programme for <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> managers according to the diverse needs of South African schools. To be able to develop a sport management programme for educator training, it was necessary to develop a related instrument that was content and context specific. Contextual, descriptive and explorative qualitative research was undertaken by means of a semi-structured interview. After the sport management competencies and needs were identified, a questionnaire (quantitative research), based on the qualitative research and the literature study in Chapters Two, Three and Four was compiled as part of the mixed-methods research design. To make a sound judgement of content and context specific sport management programmes for educator training, an occupation analysis of the identified <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> management competencies and a needs analysis of specific needs required to manage <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> was undertaken by means of a structured questionnaire. Once the competencies and needs required to manage <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> were defined, programme development principles were applied to develop a sport management programme for educator training in accordance with the diverse needs of South African schools. Conclusions drawn from the above-mentioned research include that the <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> management environment is exceptionally varied, politicised and complex. Another conclusion was that competencies required by the <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> manager can be divided into core, functional and specialist competencies, indicating a range of competencies necessary to equip and enable the <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> manager to manage <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> successfully. This phenomenon cannot merely be ignored by HEIs 2 when a content and context-specific market and needs-driven sport management programme for educator training in a diversity of South African schools is developed. It is therefore recommended that a <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> management programme be tailored to the content and context-specific needs of society and <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> managers. In the light of the preceding and a continuously changing education landscape in South Africa, it is necessary that the developed sport management programme and related guidelines for a sport management programme for initial educator training in accordance with the diverse needs of South African schools should continuously be supplemented and adapted in a dynamic <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> environment.

Fruits including apples, berries, peaches, plums and watermelons were cultivated after 1910. Omak served as a census-designated place (CDP) in 1910, and incorporated as a city on February 11, 1911. Omak and Okanogan have shared a rivalry in high <b>school</b> <b>sports.</b> During the Great Depression of 1933, several residents of Omak were forced to work in nearby communities. As a result, the United States Bureau of Reclamation promoted work which was available as part of an improvement project at Grand Coulee Dam in nearby Coulee Dam, which employed approximately 5,000 people between 1933 and 1951 when the megaproject ended. By 1950, the city was home to various buildings and structures including the St. Mary Mission church, which satisfied residential needs.|$|E
5|$|Also {{during his}} senior year, James was the {{centerpiece}} of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, he skirted state amateur bylaws by accepting a Hummer H2 from his mother, who had secured a loan for the vehicle by utilizing LeBron's future earning power as a professional athlete. This prompted {{an investigation by the}} Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) because its guidelines stated that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. James was cleared of any wrongdoing because he had accepted the gift from a family member and not from an agent or any outside source. Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an urban clothing store in exchange for posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting in him being stripped of his high <b>school</b> <b>sports</b> eligibility. James appealed the ruling and his penalty was eventually dropped to a two-game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the year. The Irish were also forced to forfeit one of their wins, their only official loss that season. In his first game back after the suspension, James scored a career-high 52 points.|$|E
40|$|M. Comm. Physical {{education}} and <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> {{are for the}} majority of students the only opportunity to be involved in physical activity and sport. In the new educational system, where physical education is being phased out due to the new teacherpupil ratios, <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> has to take over the role of physical education. The focus has shifted to <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> to fulfill the educational role, in terms of sport previously done by physical education. A case study was done at a school where the management of educationally justified <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> and physical activities was analyzed. The problem of what the management of the educationally justified <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> and physical activity would entail is seen as the central point of this study. To solve this main problem three sub-problems should be addressed, namely: • what educationally justified <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> and physical activities entail? • what the management of <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> and physical activities entail? • how the management of educationally justified <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> and physical activities manifested in a school? As a result of the problem statement, the all-encompassing aim {{of this study is to}} develop criteria for the management of educationally justified <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> and physical activities. In order to achieve this all-encompassing aim, it was necessary to: • describe the role of educationally justified <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> and physical activities~ • analyze and describe the management of <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> and physical activities; and • analyze the management of educationally justified <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> and physical activities in a school. To find possible solutions to the stated main- and sub-problems, the development of children and the role the school has to play in that development was described in the literature study. Management and all the different management functions were also described in the literature study. A case study was undertaken to analyze and describe the management of educationally justified sport and physical activities in a school. A questionnaire was compiled and handed out to the teachers involved in <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> and physical activities to complete. A structured interview was also compiled and iv the two members of the top management involved with sport and physical activities were interviewed. The following conclusions were drawn from the literature survey research: • <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> and physical activities will be educationally justified if children are led to achieving an all round development through their participation in <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> and physical activities. • it is essential that teachers realise that sport and physical activities are an extension of the classroom and it can be used as a tool in the development of children to total adulthood. • for management to be successful it needs to adhere to the following functional areas. This includes: • the marketing function; • the external relations function; • the financial function; • the human resources function; • facility and event management; • risk management. The following conclusions were drawn from the case study: • educationally justified sport and physical activities are not managed according to drawn up criteria. • some functional areas are managed properly while others don't get any attention. • a good starting point will be to set a vision and mission for <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> and physical activities. • more people could be involved in strategic management for <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> and physical activities...|$|R

40|$|M. Comm. The world-wide {{professionalisation}} {{of sport}} {{has created an}} increasing need for trained sport managers. In the South African context, a variety of Sport Management Programmes exist but guidelines and recommendations for training specifically of the South African <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> manager have neither been set nor implemented. In the view of scarce resources, demands and challenges posed by the holistic development in the new outcomes based education the <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> manager needs to be trained. Therefore, {{it is necessary that}} research be done in this area to identify and describe the competencies of the <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> manager. The aim of the study is to describe the competencies of the <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> manager in order to provide guidelines and recommendations for appropriate education and training. To find possible solutions, the historical development (longitudinal) of sport and other means of physical participation as well as the development of children and the role the school plays in that development is explored and described. Different sociological theories informed the conceptual framework for contextual description and analysis. The competencies of the <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> manager, within a commercialized context, are described with reference to its functional components and professional requirements. The methodology includes structured self-administrated interviews, preceded by a self-designed questionnaire that was completed by 12 secondary school representatives. The results indicated that the management of <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> is especially varied, politicized and complex. There is a statistically meaningful difference between the required competencies of <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> managers and what is currently in place. Relative small differences in the requirements of the management competencies of <b>school</b> <b>sport</b> managers exist according to the focus of various sport codes.

In football, catastrophic {{injuries are}} rare but are devastating when they occur. The rate of catastrophic head injuries has remained low since {{the introduction of}} the modern football helmet in the 1970s, but rates of injury are much higher {{at the high school level}} than the college level. A 2007 study found that, in high school and college football, there are an average of 7.23 catastrophic head injuries per year: there were 0.67 injuries per 100,000 high school players and 0.21 injuries per 100,000 college players. Over a 13-year period from September 1989 to June 2002, there were 94 players who sustained catastrophic head injuries—8 of these players died as a result of the injury, 46 sustained permanent neurological damage, and 36 made a full recovery. Fifty-nine percent of these players had a history of head injuries, 71% of them occurring in the same season as their catastrophic injury, and most of the catastrophic injuries resulted from being tackled or making a tackle. The study recommended that players exhibiting neurological symptoms should be strongly discouraged from returning to play.|$|E
