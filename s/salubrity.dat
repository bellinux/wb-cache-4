25|$|Bathurst {{was one of}} the {{locations}} to campaign to be the site of the new Federal Capital. In an essay prepared by a journalist with the Bathurst Times newspaper, Price Warung, in 1901 to promote Bathurst's candidacy, he responds to the Federal committees key requirements for the capital to have: centrality and accessibility of situation, <b>salubrity,</b> and capacity for impregnable defence.|$|E
25|$|The coins of Selinus are {{numerous}} and various. The earliest, as already mentioned, bear merely {{the figure of}} a parsley-leaf on the obverse. Those of somewhat later date represent a figure sacrificing on an altar, which is consecrated to Aesculapius, as indicated by a cock that stands below it. The subject of this type evidently refers to a story related by Diogenes Laertius that the Selinuntines were afflicted with a pestilence from the marshy character of the lands adjoining the neighboring river, but that this was cured by works of drainage, suggested by Empedocles. A figure standing on some coins is the river-god Selinus, who was thus made conducive to the <b>salubrity</b> of the city.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of this report the magistrates decided not to allow parish {{apprentices}} to be indentured to cotton mills where they worked at night or more than ten hours in the day. [...] Conditions at the Radcliffe mill were improved; in 1795 John Aikin's A Description of the Country from thirty to forty miles round Manchester said of Peel's mills [...] "The peculiar healthiness of-the people employed may be imputed partly to the judicious and humane regulations put in practice by Mr. Peel, and partly to the <b>salubrity</b> of the air and climate." ...|$|E
2500|$|The chief {{claim to}} fame of Sulmona is derived from its having been the birthplace of Ovid, who {{repeatedly}} alludes to it as such, and celebrates its <b>salubrity,</b> and the numerous permanent streams of clear water in which its neighbourhood abounded. But, like the whole district of the Paeligni, it was extremely cold in winter, whence Ovid himself, and Silius Italicus in imitation of him, calls it [...] "gelidus Sulmo" [...] Its territory was fertile, cultivation of both in grain and wine are common, and one district, the Pagus Fabianus, is particularly mentioned by Pliny for the care bestowed on the irrigation of the vineyards.|$|E
2500|$|The officers, {{having given}} their parole, were housed with local {{families}} and integrated themselves into local society. After [...] "several {{of the leading}} gentlemen of the county [...] been introduced to the officers, and others left their cards", the officers went riding, appearing [...] "delighted with the <b>salubrity</b> of the air", were invited to shoot on a local estate, succeeding in [...] "bagging a large quantity of game", and attended a charity concert in Brighton. Such freedom of movement left them [...] "frequently subjected to annoyance, insult, and even personal violence from the low characters who loiter in the streets", though the local magistrates dealt severely with such offences.|$|E

60|$|The 4th {{infantry}} {{went into}} camp at <b>Salubrity</b> {{in the month}} of May, 1844, with instructions, as I have said, to await further orders. At first, officers and men occupied ordinary tents. As the summer heat increased these were covered by sheds to break the rays of the sun. The summer was whiled away in social enjoyments among the officers, in visiting those stationed at, and near, Fort Jessup, twenty-five miles away, visiting the planters on the Red River, and the citizens of Natchitoches and Grand Ecore. There was much pleasant intercourse between the inhabitants and the officers of the army. I retain very agreeable recollections of my stay at Camp <b>Salubrity,</b> and of the acquaintances made there, and no doubt my feeling is shared by the few officers living who were there at the time. I can call to mind only two officers of the 4th infantry, besides myself, who were at Camp <b>Salubrity</b> with the regiment, who are now alive.|$|E
60|$|But I {{must not}} linger in Grahamstown now. When {{there in the}} body, I was sorely tempted to do so, too long, by the {{kindness}} of friends and the <b>salubrity</b> of the weather. Adieu, Grahamstown! thou art a green spot in memory, {{as well as in}} reality.|$|E

"Precisely so--alas! that we should, this day, be so {{far from}} those regions of peace, delight, intelligence, and <b>salubrity!</b> But the will of Providence be done!--doubtless there is a wise motive for our captivity and sufferings, which may yet lead to the further glory of the monikin race!" ...|$|E
60|$|All climates are comparative, {{and fixed}} {{residents}} naturally praise their own. I have visited many latitudes, and can truly say that I {{have found no}} two climates resembling each other, and that all alike are complained of. That of Dorjiling is above the average in point of comfort, and for perfect <b>salubrity</b> rivals any; while in variety, interest, and grandeur, the scenery is unequalled.|$|E

[...] "Of course when a body begins to expand, there comes in the {{possibility}} of bursting; but I nevertheless approve of a certain tension of one's being. It 's what a man is meant for. And then I believe in the essential <b>salubrity</b> of genius--true genius." ...|$|E
60|$|I can't not {{thank you}} for your {{interesting}} remittances, the one about the <b>Salubrity</b> of the Soldier perhaps in particular. That paper is indeed an admirable statement of what one is mainly struck with--the only at all consoling thing in all the actual horror, namely: the splendid personal condition of the khaki-clad as they overflow the town. It represents a kind of physical redemption--and that is something, is much, so long as the individual case of it lasts.|$|E
60|$|But to return, to {{the happy}} Regions of the Lunar Continent, I was no sooner Landed there, and had lookt about me, but I was surpriz'd with the strange Alteration of the Climate and Country; and {{particularly}} a strange <b>Salubrity</b> and Fragrancy in the Air, which I felt so Nourishing, so Pleasant and Delightful, that tho' I could perceive some small Respiration, {{it was hardly}} discernable, and the least requisite for Life, supplied so long that the Bellows of Nature were hardly imployed.|$|E
60|$|The {{immediate}} neighbourhood of Millbank Penitentiary is not {{one which}} we should, for its own sake, choose for our residence, either on account of its natural beauty, or the excellence of its habitations. That it is a salubrious locality must be presumed {{from the fact that}} it has been selected for the site of the institution in question; but <b>salubrity,</b> though doubtless a great recommendation, would hardly reconcile us to the extremely dull, and one might almost say, ugly aspect which this district bears.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You know in what {{direction}} my wishes tend, viz., that Coley, {{when he has}} come to suitable age, and has developed, as I have no doubt he will, a fitness for the work, should be the first island Bishop, upon the foundation, of which you and your brother Judge, and Sir W. Farquhar, are trustees; that Norfolk Island should be the see of the Bishop, because the character of its population, the <b>salubrity</b> of its climate, and its insular position, make it the fittest place for the purpose.|$|E
6000|$|... [16] The {{climate of}} Aden, {{it may be}} observed, has a {{reputation}} for <b>salubrity</b> which it does not deserve. The returns of deaths prove it to be healthy for the European soldier as London, and there are many who have built their belief upon the sandy soil of statistics. But it is the practice of every sensible medical man to hurry his patients out of Aden; they die elsewhere,--some I believe recover,--and thus the deaths caused by the crater are attributed statistically to Bombay or the Red Sea.|$|E
60|$|The {{beauty and}} the <b>salubrity</b> of Antium made it a very {{attractive}} place of summer resort {{for the people of}} Rome; and in process of time, when the city attained to an advanced stage of opulence and luxury, the Roman noblemen built villas there, choosing situations, in some instances, upon the natural terraces and esplanades of the promontory, which looked off over the sea, and in others cool and secluded retreats in the valleys, on the land. It was in one of these villas that Nero was born.|$|E
60|$|No {{man ever}} admits the unhealthiness {{of the place}} he dwells in (unless he is going away from it), and I shall therefore, I have no doubt, be at issue with the {{inhabitants}} of St. Louis, in questioning the perfect <b>salubrity</b> of its climate, and in hinting that I think it must rather dispose to fever, {{in the summer and}} autumnal seasons. Just adding, that it is very hot, lies among great rivers, and has vast tracts of undrained swampy land around it, I leave the reader to form his own opinion.|$|E
60|$|In those {{happy days}} when cash {{had begun to}} flow in plenteously to the young father of the family, he had taken it into his head to build for himself, or rather for his young female brood, a small neat house in the {{outskirts}} of Saratoga Springs. In doing so he was instigated as much by the excellence of the investment for his pocket as by the <b>salubrity</b> of the place for his girls. He furnished the house well, and then during some summer weeks his wife lived there, and sometimes he let it.|$|E
6000|$|Of the {{southern}} part of this district Lieutenant Wilkes, who commanded the late exploring expedition under the United States government, says, [...] "Few portions of the globe are so rich in soil, so diversified in surface, or so capable of being rendered the happy homes of an industrious and civilised community. For beauty of scenery and <b>salubrity</b> of climate it cannot be surpassed. It is peculiarly adapted for an agricultural and pastoral people, and no portion of the world beyond the tropics can be found that will yield so readily with moderate labour to the wants of man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Truly," [...] said Mr. Bulstrode, {{with some}} coldness. [...] "With regard {{to what you}} say, Mr. Lydgate, about the {{relaxation}} of my mental labor, I have for some time been entertaining a purpose to that effect--a purpose of a very decided character. I contemplate at least a temporary withdrawal from the management of much business, whether benevolent or commercial. Also I think of changing my residence for a time: probably I shall close or let 'The Shrubs,' and take some place near the coast--under advice of course as to <b>salubrity.</b> That would be a measure which you would recommend?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The Times special correspondent, in {{a letter}} from Vancouver's Island, {{published}} on 10th August, says, [...] "Productive fisheries, prolific whaling waters, extensive coalfields, a country well timbered in some parts, susceptible of every agricultural improvement in ethers, with rich gold fields on the very borders--these {{are some of the}} many advantages enjoyed by the colony of Vancouver's Island and its fortunate possessors. When I add that the island boasts a climate of great <b>salubrity,</b> with a winter temperature resembling that of England, and a summer little inferior to that of Paris, I need say no more, lest my picture be suspected of sharing too deeply of couleur de rose." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly, at present, {{our hands}} are much too full here to permit of our {{engaging}} in any enterprise {{of this kind}} but, at the same time, it is desirable that we should obtain some reliable information as to the situation there, {{the power of this}} rajah, and the advantages that the island offers in the way of ports, the <b>salubrity</b> of its climate, and other similar particulars. Its possession would certainly be desirable, not only as a centre for future trade with Bankok and the East, but as a port from which our vessels of war might suppress the piracy that prevails all along the Malay coast, and in the neighbouring island of Sumatra. Such information may be extremely useful in the future, and when our power in this country is consolidated.|$|E
60|$|A novel {{attraction}} {{about this}} young man, which a glancing stranger would know nothing of, {{was a rare}} and curious freshness of atmosphere that appertained to him, to his clothes, to all his belongings, even to the room {{in which he had}} been sitting. It might almost have been said that by adding him and his implements to an over-crowded apartment you made it healthful. This resulted from his trade. He was a lime-burner; he handled lime daily; and in return the lime rendered him an incarnation of <b>salubrity.</b> His hair was dry, fair, and frizzled, the latter possibly by the operation of the same caustic agent. He carried as a walking-stick a green sapling, whose growth had been contorted to a corkscrew pattern by a twining honeysuckle.|$|E
60|$|At Camp <b>Salubrity,</b> {{and when}} we went to New Orleans Barracks, the 4th {{infantry}} was commanded by Colonel Vose, then an old gentleman who had not commanded on drill for a number of years. He was not a man to discover infirmity in the presence of danger. It now appeared that war was imminent, and he felt that it was his duty to brush up his tactics. Accordingly, when we got settled down at our new post, he took command of the regiment at a battalion drill. Only two or three evolutions had been gone through when he dismissed the battalion, and, turning to go to his own quarters, dropped dead. He had not been complaining of ill health, but no doubt died of heart disease. He was a most estimable man, of exemplary habits, and by no means the author of his own disease.|$|E
60|$|I {{have said}} enough, dear sister, {{to make you}} see that I {{continue}} {{to see the world}} with perhaps even enviable profit. But don't envy me too much; for the British country-house has at moments, for a cosmopolitanised American, an insuperable flatness. On the other hand, to do it justice, there is no doubt of its being one of the ripest fruits of time--and here in Scotland, where you get the conveniences of Mayfair dovetailed into the last romanticism of nature--of the highest results of civilization. Such as it is, at any rate, I shall probably have a little more of it.... Scotland is decidedly a thing to see and which it would have been idiocy to have foregone. Did I tell you I was now London correspondent of the Nation? Farewell, dearest child and sister. I wish I could blow you a little of the <b>salubrity</b> of bonnie Scotland. The lunch-bell is striking up and I hurry off with comprehensive blessings.|$|E
60|$|It {{would not}} be at all {{difficult}} to prove that an army of an hundred thousand men, horse, foot, and artillery, might have been employed against the enemy, on the very soil which he has usurped, at a far less expense than has been squandered away upon tropical adventures. In these adventures {{it was not an}} enemy we had to vanquish, but a cemetery to conquer. In carrying on the war in the West Indies, the hostile sword is merciful, the country in which we engage is the dreadful enemy. There the European conqueror finds a cruel defeat in the very fruits of his success. Every advantage is but a new demand on England for recruits to the West Indian grave. In a West India war, the Regicides have for their troops a race of fierce barbarians, to whom the poisoned air, in which our youth inhale certain death, is <b>salubrity</b> and life. To them the climate is the surest and most faithful of allies.|$|E
6000|$|As {{a subject}} for the remarks of the evening [...] "The perpetuation of our {{political}} institutions" [...] is selected. In the great journal of things happening under the sun, we, the American people, find our account running under {{the date of the}} nineteenth century of the Christian era. We find ourselves in the peaceful possession of the fairest portion of the earth, as regards extent of territory, fertility of soil, and <b>salubrity</b> of climate. We find ourselves under the government of a system of political institutions conducing more essentially to the ends of civil and religious liberty, than any of which the history of former times tells us. We, when remounting the stage of existence, found ourselves the legal inheritors of these fundamental blessings. We toiled not in the acquirement or the establishment of them; they are a legacy bequeathed to us by a once hardy, brave, and patriotic, but now lamented and departed race of ancestors.|$|E
6000|$|If the North do {{conquer the}} South, and so arrange their matters that the Southern States shall again become {{members of the}} Union, it will be {{admitted}} {{that they have done}} all that they ought to do. If they do not do this--if instead of doing this, which would be all that they desire, they were in truth to do nothing; to win finally not one foot of ground from the South--a supposition which I regard as impossible--I think that we should still admit after awhile that they had done their duty in endeavoring to maintain the integrity of the empire. But if, as a third and more probable alternative, they succeed in rescuing from the South and from slavery four or five of the finest States of the old Union--and a vast portion of the continent to be beaten by none other in <b>salubrity,</b> fertility, beauty, and political importance--will it not then be admitted that the war has done some good, and that the life and treasure have not been spent in vain? ...|$|E
60|$|The 3d {{infantry}} {{had selected}} camping grounds {{on the reservation}} at Fort Jessup, about midway between the Red River and the Sabine. Our orders required us to go into camp in the same neighborhood, and await further instructions. Those authorized to do so selected {{a place in the}} pine woods, between the old town of Natchitoches and Grand Ecore, about three miles from each, and on high ground back from the river. The place was given the name of Camp <b>Salubrity,</b> and proved entitled to it. The camp was on a high, sandy, pine ridge, with spring branches in the valley, in front and rear. The springs furnished an abundance of cool, pure water, and the ridge was above the flight of mosquitoes, which abound in that region in great multitudes and of great voracity. In the valley they swarmed in myriads, but never came to the summit of the ridge. The regiment occupied this camp six months before the first death occurred, and that was caused by an accident.|$|E
6000|$|On October 10, 1856, {{about four}} hundred people were camped in Tasajara Valley, California. It {{could not have}} been for the prospect, since a more barren, dreary, monotonous, and uninviting {{landscape}} never stretched before human eye; it {{could not have been}} for convenience or contiguity, as the nearest settlement was thirty miles away; it could not have been for health or <b>salubrity,</b> as the breath of the ague-haunted tules in the outlying Stockton marshes swept through the valley; it could not have been for space or comfort, for, encamped on an unlimited plain, men and women were huddled together as closely as in an urban tenement-house, without the freedom or decency of rural isolation; it could not have been for pleasant companionship, as dejection, mental anxiety, tears, and lamentation were the dominant expression; it was not a hurried flight from present or impending calamity, for the camp had been deliberately planned, and for a week pioneer wagons had been slowly arriving; it was not an irrevocable exodus, for some had already returned to their homes that others might take their places. It was simply a religious revival of one or two denominational sects, known as a [...] "camp-meeting." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the mean}} time, Darius, leading the great {{body of the}} army, {{advanced}} from the Bosporus by land. The country which the troops thus traversed was Thrace. They met with various adventures as they proceeded, and saw, as the accounts of the expedition state, many strange and marvelous phenomena. They came, for example, to the sources of a very wonderful river, which flows west and south toward the Ægean Sea. The name of the river was the Tearus. It came from thirty-eight springs, all issuing from the same rock, some hot and some cold. The waters of the stream which was produced by the mingling of these fountains were pure, limpid, and delicious, and were possessed of remarkable medicinal properties, being efficacious for the cure of various diseases. Darius was so much pleased with this river, that his army halted to refresh themselves with its waters, and he caused one of his monuments to be erected on the spot, the inscription of which contained not only the usual memorials of the march, but also {{a tribute to the}} <b>salubrity</b> of the waters of this magical stream.|$|E
60|$|Similar {{announcements}} {{may be seen}} {{upon the}} walls concerning enlistments in the army. And never did auctioneer dilate with more rapture upon the charms of some country-seat put up for sale, than the authors of these placards do, upon the beauty and <b>salubrity</b> of the distant climes, for which the regiments wanting recruits are about to sail. Bright lawns, vine-clad hills, endless meadows of verdure, here make up the landscape; and adventurous young gentlemen, fond of travel, are informed, that here {{is a chance for}} them to see the world at their leisure, and be paid for enjoying themselves into the bargain. The regiments for India are promised plantations among valleys of palms; while to those destined for New Holland, a novel sphere of life and activity is opened; and the companies bound to Canada and Nova Scotia are lured by tales of summer suns, that ripen grapes in December. No word of war is breathed; hushed is the clang of arms in these announcements; and the sanguine recruit is almost tempted to expect that pruning-hooks, instead of swords, will be the weapons he will wield.|$|E
