For example, Microsoft featured Bing Pulse during the 2013 State of The Union (US) address by president Barack Obama. The system allowed registered users to input their responses (positive, negative, neutral) to the address and visualized the results as a trending graph in real time. Bing Pulse has since been used to cast over 35 million votes during national news broadcasts and other live meetings. Over 10,000 viewers powered the iPowow Viewer Vote [...] which tracked live viewer emotional response for Channel 7 during the 2013 Australian Federal Election debates and displayed as a live [...] "worm" [...] graph on the broadcast screen.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} iSee, a crowdsourced {{approach to}} detect-ing and localizing events in outdoor environments. Upon spotting an event, an iSee user only needs to <b>swipe</b> <b>on</b> her smartphone’s touchscreen {{in the direction}} of the event. These swiping directions are often inaccurate and so are the com-pass measurements. Moreover, the swipes do not encode any notion of how far the event is located from the user, neither is the GPS location of the user accurate. Furthermore, multiple events may occur simultaneously and users do not explicitly indicate which events they are swiping towards. Nonethe-less, as more users start contributing data, we show that our proposed system is able to quickly detect and estimate the locations of the events. We have implemented iSee on An-droid phones and have experimented in real-world settings by planting virtual “events ” in our campus and asking volunteers to <b>swipe</b> <b>on</b> seeing one. Results show that iSee performs ap-preciably better than established triangulation and clustering-based approaches, in terms of localization accuracy, detection coverage, and robustness to sensor noise.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} dehumanizing communication reified in higher institutions of learning, among undergraduates and lecturers.

40|$|The maximal {{sensitivity}} of the Smith-Waterman (SW) algorithm has enabled its wide use in biological sequence database search. Unfortunately, the high sensitivity comes {{at the expense of}} quadratic time complexity, which makes the algorithm computationally demanding for big databases. In this paper, we present SWAPHI, the first parallelized algorithm employing Xeon Phi coprocessors to accelerate SW protein database search. SWAPHI is designed based on the scale-and-vectorize approach, i. e. it boosts alignment speed by effectively utilizing both the coarse-grained parallelism from the many co-processing cores (scale) and the fine-grained parallelism from the 512 -bit wide single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) vectors within each core (vectorize). By searching against the large UniProtKB/TrEMBL protein database, SWAPHI achieves a performance of up to 58. 8 billion cell updates per second (GCUPS) on one coprocessor and up to 228. 4 GCUPS on four coprocessors. Furthermore, it demonstrates good parallel scalability on varying number of coprocessors, and is also superior to both <b>SWIPE</b> <b>on</b> 16 high-end CPU cores and BLAST+ on 8 cores when using four coprocessors, with the maximum speedup of 1. 52 and 1. 86, respectively. SWAPHI is written in C++ language (with a set of SIMD intrinsics), and is freely available at [URL] A short version of this paper has been accepted by the IEEE ASAP 2014 conferenc...|$|E
40|$|The Internet is a {{remarkable}} tool—so remarkable that using the word “tool” to describe it is painfully inadequate. With a click of a mouse, a few strokes on a keyboard, or a <b>swipe</b> <b>on</b> a screen, the Internet allows instant communication and transaction at any time by anyone in the world. Young people, especially, have embraced the Internet {{as a means of}} communicating with peers and interacting with the world around them. In fact, the Internet may {{be thought of as a}} social context—similar to school, church, or home—where young people’s identities are influenced and shaped. As a result, what takes place online may have implications in the off-line world. One of those offline places implicated by Internet expression is the public school system. Public elementary and high schools are unique institutions. They have long been recognized as playing a dominant role in maintaining our democratic society by inculcating in students certain values such as respect, honesty, citizenship, responsibility, and integrity. And, because public students enjoy less constitutional protections on school grounds and during school hours, public schools have been permitted to discourage expression and behavior that conflicts with those values. But there is a disagreement over whether public schools may discourage Internet expression that conflicts with those values. This Comment seeks to explain why permitting schools to limit certain Internet expression—regardless where or when the Internet expression occurred— promotes the educational mission of public schools...|$|E
40|$|In {{the realm}} of machine {{learning}} research and application, binary classification algorithms, i. e. algorithms that attempt to induce discriminant functions between two categories of data, reign supreme. Their fundamental property is the reliance {{on the availability of}} data from all known categories in order to induce functions that can offer acceptable levels of accuracy. Unfortunately, data from so-called "real-world" domains sometimes do not satisfy this property. In order to tackle this, researchers focus on methods such as sampling and cost-sensitive classification to make the data more conducive for binary classifiers. However, as this thesis shall argue, there are scenarios in which even such explicit methods to rectify distributions fail. In such cases, one-class classification algorithms become a practical alternative. Unfortunately, if the domain is inherently complex, the advantage that they offer over binary classifiers becomes diminished. The work in this thesis addresses this issue, and builds a framework that allows for one-class algorithms to build efficient classifiers. In particular, this thesis introduces the notion of learning along the lines sub-concepts in the domain; the complexity in domains arises due to the presence of sub-concepts, and by learning over them explicitly rather than on the entire domain as a whole, we can produce powerful one-class classification systems. The level of knowledge regarding these sub-concepts will naturally vary by domain, and thus we develop three distinct frameworks that take the amount of domain knowledge available into account. We demonstrate these frameworks over three real-world domains. The first domain we consider is that of biometric authentication via a users <b>swipe</b> <b>on</b> a smartphone. We identify sub-concepts based on a users motion, and given that modern smartphones employ sensors that can identify motion, during learning as well as application, sub-concepts can be identified explicitly, and novel instances can be processed by the appropriate one-class classifier. The second domain is that of invasive isotope detection via gamma-ray spectra. The sub-concepts are based on environmental factors; however, the hardware employed cannot detect such concepts, and quantifying the precise source that creates these sub-concepts is difficult to ascertain. To remedy this, we introduce a novel framework in which we employ a sub-concept detector by means of a multi-class classifier, which pre-processes novel instances in order to send them to the correct one-class classifier. The third domain is that of compliance verification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) through Xenon isotope measurements. This domain presents the worst case where sub-concepts are not known. To this end, we employ a generic version of our framework in which we simply cluster the domain and build classifiers over each cluster. In all cases, we demonstrate that learning in the context of domain concepts greatly improves the performance of one-class classifiers...|$|E

30|$|In {{the first}} variant, Pivot plane-casting, the plane rotated about a pivot point {{located in the}} center of the 3 D space.

Thus, by translating the object on the plane away from the pivot point and then rotating the plane, the object could be positioned at any point (Fig.  1). A disadvantage of Pivot plane-casting is that it requires a “clutch” button to disable plane rotation. Without this capability, users would have to always hold the device at a fixed orientation to stabilize the object’s position.
