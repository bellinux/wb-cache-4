Sound men who designed the showroom consulted with sound engineers at the University of California, Los Angeles.

In addition, Parker was named as a part owner in the resort. In April 1964, a fire started in one of the hotel rooms and caused smoke damage to part of the hotel. The fire was believed to have been started by a cigarette.|$|E
25|$|Two {{years prior}} to the Hawker Henley's arrival (Summer 1941) a Supermarine Spitfire Mk II, P7674 had been {{delivered}} to Hucknall and was fitted with a Crecy mock-up to enable cowling drawings and <b>system</b> <b>details</b> to be designed. It had been agreed that the first production Spitfire Mk III would be delivered to Hucknall in early 1942 minus its Merlin engine for fitment of an airworthy Crecy, but this delivery did not occur. A Royal Aircraft Establishment report (No. E.3932) of March 1942 estimated the performance of the Spitfire fitted with a Crecy engine and compared this to a Griffon 61-powered variant. The report stated that the Crecy's maximum power output would be too much for the Spitfire airframe but that a derated version would have considerable performance gains over the Griffon-powered fighter.|$|E

5000|$|Many OSS {{systems were}} {{initially}} not linked {{to each other}} and often required manual intervention. For example, consider the case where a customer wants to order a new telephone service. The ordering system would take the customer's details and details of their order, but {{would not be able to}} configure the telephone exchange directly--this would be done by a switch management <b>system.</b> <b>Details</b> of the new service would need to be transferred from the order handling system to the switch management system, and this would normally be done by a technician re-keying the details from one screen into another, a process often referred to as [...] "swivel chair integration".

50|$|Clarity is {{the extent}} of {{unambiguous}} comprehension the system's structure and behavior models convey. Completeness {{is the extent}} of specification for all the system's details. These two model attributes conflict with each other. On the one hand, completeness requires the full stipulation of <b>system</b> <b>details.</b> On the other hand, the need for clarity imposes an upper limit {{on the extent of}} detail within an individual model diagram, after which comprehension deteriorates because of clutter and overloading. Establishing an appropriate balance requires careful management of context during model development. However, the modeler may take advantage of the union of information provided by the entire OPD set of an OPM system model and have one OPD which is clear and unambiguous but not complete, and another that focuses on completeness for some smaller part of the system by adding more details.|$|E

50|$|The method {{developed}} by Bjerrum {{is still the}} main method in use today, though the precision of the measurements has greatly increased. Most commonly, a solution containing the metal ion and the ligand in a medium of high ionic strength is first acidified {{to the point where}} the ligand is fully protonated. This solution is then titrated, often by means of a computer-controlled auto-titrator, with a solution of CO2-free base. The concentration, or activity, of the hydrogen ion is monitored by means of a glass electrode. The data set used for the calculation has three components: a statement defining the nature of the chemical species that will be present, called the model of the <b>system,</b> <b>details</b> concerning the concentrations of the reagents used in the titration, and finally the experimental measurements in the form of titre and pH (or emf) pairs.|$|E
50|$|The {{most widely}} used {{operating}} system for the 1130 was the Disk Monitor System Version 2 (DM2) introduced in 1967. DM2 was a single-task batch-oriented system. It required a system with at least 4 KB of core memory and one integrated 2310 disk drive for system residence. The Supervisor was tiny by modern standards, containing assorted <b>system</b> <b>details</b> such as first-level interrupt routines, called Interrupt Level Subroutines, plus the disk driver and routines to load the interpreter of job control commands and the card reader driver. Device drivers for other I/O devices required by a job were incorporated {{as part of the}} loading of that job, which might also include the replacement of the basic disk driver by a more advanced driver. During the execution of a job, only a resident monitor, called the Skeleton Supervisor resided in memory. This Supervisor required just 1020 bytes, so a task's first available memory started with address /01FE (hexadecimal) or word 510. When the job ended or was aborted, the Supervisor loaded the Monitor Control Record Analyzer (MCRA) to read the job control for the next. While the job was running, the Supervisor was inactive. Aside from device drivers and interrupt processing all CPU time was entirely devoted to the job's activities. Other programs distributed as part of the operating system were a core dump utility, DUMP, and the Disk Utility Program, DUP.|$|E
