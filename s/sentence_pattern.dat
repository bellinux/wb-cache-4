40|$|This paper, {{the second}} in the series {{entitled}} 'On Grammar Teaching for Japanese Learners of English as a Foreign Language', presents a case for the teaching of <b>sentence</b> <b>patterns</b> in the beginning stages of English language learning at Japanese junior high school. First of all, several arguments are presented for teaching English grammar explicitly in the beginning stages of learning {{on the basis of}} the discussion of the nature of language as a system of systems, the characteristics of adolescent learners, the role of grammar in communication, and the educational and socio-linguistic factors associated with English language teaching at junior high school in Japan. After presenting a case for grammar teaching in the beginning stages, the paper presents a case for teaching <b>sentence</b> <b>patterns</b> in the beginning stages, arguing that <b>sentence</b> <b>patterns</b> represent basic syntagmatic and paradigmatic relations of English, that <b>sentence</b> <b>patterns</b> can facilitate the learning of a language as a system of systems, that the ability to deal with <b>sentence</b> <b>patterns</b> may lead to the formation of the common core of grammatical competence in English, and that <b>sentence</b> <b>patterns</b> can also generate linguistic creativity through the use of varying vocabulary. Finally, the paper discusses strategies for the teaching of <b>sentence</b> <b>patterns</b> in the beginning stages. The basic approach adopted in this paper is developmental and cognitive. It is developmental in a sense that it argues for the adaptation of <b>sentence</b> <b>patterns</b> to the developmental stages of learners. It is cognitive in a sense that it encourages the learners to make a conscious and deliberate use of <b>sentence</b> <b>patterns</b> in their attempt to comprehend and produce English sentences. The approach is also based upon the theory of information processing, which indicates that information is usually processed in terms of natural chunks. It is argued that elements of <b>sentence</b> <b>patterns</b> can function as natural chunks which enable the learners to process incoming information effectively. It is also argued that the whole process of English language learning can be equated with the process of the diversification and expansion of chunks in <b>sentence</b> <b>patterns...</b>|$|R

40|$|I {{present the}} result of a small {{investigation}} of the <b>sentence</b> <b>pattern</b> in a sample of spoken Swedish. As expected, the typical constituent order is SV – more than 70 percent of the declaratives displayed this constituent order. This result is in line with previous investigations, but the figure is higher. An absolute majority of sentences have a pronominal element in sentence initial position, in most cases a subject pronoun, but it could also be an object pronoun or an adverb. Since information structure and prosody are interrelated, this means that there is a strong bias in Swedish to have a backgrounded or thematic element that is prosodically light, immediately preceding the finite verb. Due to the fact that preverbal doubling, i. e. the <b>sentence</b> <b>pattern</b> XP – pronominal – FV, is quite common, I suggest, tentatively, a new definition of the V 2 constraint, which is based on semantics. In one sense this means that Swedish can be a V 3 language; V 3 is grammatical, provided the elements preceding the finite verb are semantically indistinct...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a sentence pattern-based English-Korean machine translation system {{backed up by}} a rule-based module {{as a solution to}} the translation of long sentences. A rule-based English-Korean MT system typically suffers from low translation accuracy for long sentences due to poor parsing performance. In the proposed method we only use chunking information on the phrase-level of the parse result (i. e. NP, PP, and AP). By applying a <b>sentence</b> <b>pattern</b> directly to a chunking result, the high performance of analysis and a good quality of translation are expected. The parsing efficiency problem in the traditional RBMT approach is resolved by sentence partitioning, which is generally assumed to have many problems. However, we will show that the sentence partitioning has little side effect, if any, in our approach, because we use only the chunking results for the transfer. The coverage problem of a pattern-based method is overcome by applying <b>sentence</b> <b>pattern</b> matching recursively to the sub-sentences of the input sentence, in case there is no exact matching pattern to the input sentence. ...|$|E

In addition, from the data, it showed that the subject used three types of codes which were English, Indonesian, and mixed one (Indonesian and English). Yet, the most frequently code used by the subject was Indonesian (56. 97 %).
