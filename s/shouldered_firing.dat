50|$|The M18 {{recoilless}} rifle was a 57 mm <b>shoulder</b> <b>fired</b> anti-tank {{recoilless rifle}} {{used by the}} U.S. Army in World War II and the Korean War. Recoilless rifles are capable of firing artillery-type shells at reduced velocities {{comparable to those of}} standard cannon, but with greater accuracy than anti-tank weapons that used unguided rockets, and almost entirely without recoil. The M18 was a breech-loaded, single-shot, man-portable, crew-served weapon. It could be used in both anti-tank and anti-personnel roles. The weapon could be both <b>shoulder</b> <b>fired</b> or fired from a prone position. The T3 front grip doubled as an adjustable monopod and the two-piece padded T3 shoulder cradle could swing down and to the rear as a bipod for the gunner. The most stable firing position was from the tripod developed for the water-cooled Browning M1917 machine gun.|$|R
2500|$|Rifles are <b>shoulder</b> <b>fired</b> guns with rifled barrels, {{and provide}} the {{greatest}} accuracy and range of all hunting weapons. Centerfire rifles are generally used for killing big-game species. Rimfire rifles, such as the [...]22 Long Rifle, are used for killing small-game species.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, NBC aired Kings {{which has}} a {{narrative}} loosely based on the Biblical story of King David, but set in a kingdom that culturally and technologically resembles the present-day United States. The part of Goliath is portrayed by a tank, which David destroys with a <b>shoulder</b> <b>fired</b> rocket launcher.|$|R
50|$|Operation Sure Win 202 (Vietnamese : Chiến dịch Quyết Thắng 202) was a 1964 Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) {{operation}} {{carried out}} with US support. ARVN commandos were transported by U.S. helicopters behind entrenched Viet Cong positions, attacking them with <b>shoulder</b> <b>fired</b> rockets and flame throwers. Sniper teams then tracked the fleeing rebels and engaged them.|$|R
50|$|The {{external}} look of {{the missile}} is similar to earlier QW missile {{with the exception of}} adding a booster with greater diameter than that of the missile. Due to the increased size and weight, the missile cannot be <b>shoulder</b> <b>fired</b> like other MANPAD, but must be fired from bipod or tripod like French Mistral missile and Swedish RBS 70.|$|R
50|$|The Main Battle Tank and Light Anti-tank Weapon (MBT LAW), {{also known}} as the NLAW, is a joint British and Swedish {{short-range}} fire-and-forget anti-tank missile system. Designed for use by infantry, the MBT LAW is <b>shoulder</b> <b>fired</b> and disposable, firing once before being disposed of. It is currently in use with the military forces of the United Kingdom, Finland, Luxembourg, and Sweden.|$|R
25|$|I learnt about weapons such as {{ballistic}} missiles, {{surface to}} surface and <b>shoulder</b> <b>fired</b> missiles, anti aircraft and anti-tank rockets, rapid fire heavy and light machine guns, pistols, AK47s, mines and explosives.

5000|$|The Henry rifle had {{a copper}} or brass {{cartridge}} that effectively sealed the breech {{of the gun}} so that the hot propellant gases would be held inside of the gun. The ignition source was a folded rim {{on the inside of}} the gun. The inventor of the gun was able to mass-produce a cartridge that had a powerful powder charge. The power of a Henry Rifle was comparable in power to military pistols, but that was not enough to be used as a <b>shoulder</b> <b>fired</b> rifle for the military. While most <b>shoulder</b> <b>fired</b> rifles during the time fired a bullet between 350 and 500 grains propelled by 40 to 60 grains of powder the Henry rifle shot a small [...]44 bullet of only 200 grains and 26 to 28 grains of black powder, giving it a quite short range. While the Henry was carried and used by men in the Civil War it was not widely accepted or popular by the military. Nonetheless, Henry and Spencer rifles were used at the December 1864 Battle of Nashville to quite devastating effect.|$|R
50|$|A {{previous}} {{requirement for}} 100 units of 81 mm mortar, 335 units of rocket launchers/light anti-tank weapons, 18 units 155 mm towed howitzers with 5-ton truck prime movers {{was announced in}} 2008. plus night fighting systems. The Serbian-made M69B 81 mm mortar was selected for the mortar requirement which were completely delivered in 2013, while the 155 mm towed howitzers requirements were revised. The acquisition for <b>shoulder</b> <b>fired</b> rocket launchers and night fighting systems are still in process.|$|R
50|$|The Zastava M77 B1 is {{a battle}} rifle {{developed}} and manufactured by Zastava Arms in Serbia (formerly Yugoslavia). It was introduced in 1977. It is a derivative of the Zastava M70 and modified copy of the Soviet AKM, chambered in Western 7.62×51mm caliber with an enlarged receiver, and Western type flash eliminator added. It is gas-operated, air-cooled, magazine-fed, <b>shoulder</b> <b>fired</b> and selective fire firearm with a fixed wooden stock. The M77 AB1 has a folding stock.|$|R
50|$|Only one similar {{weapon was}} ever constructed, the KPB-12.7 (КПБ-12,7). It was {{intended}} as a hand-held machine gun. Some sources state the weapon was uncontrollable when <b>shoulder</b> <b>fired</b> in fully automatic mode. The recoil-reducing system allowed this weapon to be <b>fired</b> from the <b>shoulder,</b> but it still had an insufficient reliability and an insufficient accuracy in single shots, and accurate bursts were also all but impossible from such large caliber but lightweight weapon with a limited magazine capacity.|$|R
5000|$|Events of {{the series}} are set into motion when young David Shepherd, a Gilboan soldier in a war against the Republic of Gath, single-handedly rescues a captive soldier from behind enemy lines and destroys a [...] "Goliath-Class" [...] tank with a <b>shoulder</b> <b>fired</b> missile launcher. The captive soldier is Prince Jack, and David not only becomes an instant star in the {{national}} media, but he also earns the gratitude of King Silas, much {{to the chagrin of}} the prince.|$|R

50|$|The Zastava M90 is the {{modified}} version of Zastava M80, itself {{a version of the}} Zastava M70 (chambered in Western 5.56×45mm NATO round), also comes with a flash eliminator and different magazine design, which means that like its predecessor, the M90 is a modified Soviet AKM. It is gas-operated, air-cooled and magazine-fed, <b>shoulder</b> <b>fired</b> weapon with selective fire capability, and like M70, can launch rifle grenades and has a rifle grenade sight added on the gas tube, instead of under barrel grenade launcher like on most other AK variants.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} morning of 18 January, Coalition {{aircraft}} began a major campaign against Iraqi forces {{in preparation for the}} ground invasion of Kuwait and Iraq. Many of these jets and air sorties were coming from aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships located in the Persian Gulf. Whilst jets were flying over the oil field they reported taking heavy fire from SAMs and <b>shoulder</b> <b>fired</b> rockets. The US suspected that there was a large garrison of Iraqi troops located there being used as an outpost for reporting Coalition aircraft movements back to Iraq.|$|R
5000|$|The weapon {{consists}} of a long barrel tube with a flared muzzle, supported by a simple carriage with two small solid wheels. A curved shoulder pad is attached to {{left side of the}} barrel, and a large shield is fitted to protect the crew from the back-blast produced by the rocket projectiles. The shield is not thick enough to provide protection from enemy fire. The weapon is normally fired from the carriage, but it can be dismounted and <b>shoulder</b> <b>fired</b> by two men working together to support the weapon.|$|R
40|$|This report briefly {{outlines}} {{the history of}} incidents involving civilian flights being hit by <b>shoulder</b> <b>fired</b> missiles and discusses the Directed Infrared Countermeasure (DIRCM) systems, which were developed to be mounted on commercial airliners for defense against infrared guided missiles and were never widely implemented. The report discusses the limitations of DIRCM systems, especially {{in the context of}} Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, which would not have been saved by such a system due to having been brought down by a radar-guided missile. The report also examines alternative ways to protect commercial airliners from missile attacks, such as flight techniques and ground-based systems...|$|R
5000|$|The SPG-9 {{is widely}} {{available}} to terrorists and maritime pirates in the Horn of Africa region, {{as well as}} in other regions to a lesser degree. It is not as popular as the RPG-7 because it has to be mounted on a vehicle or boat and cannot be easily carried and <b>shoulder</b> <b>fired.</b> The SPG-9 requires much more skill to fire accurately in comparison to the RPG-7. There have been reports of these mounted in skiffs and larger [...] "mother ships". The SPG-9 can typically be found mounted {{on a wide variety of}} vehicles known as [...] "technicals" [...] in Somalia.|$|R

5000|$|During this period, Hicks kept a {{notebook}} to document his training in weapon use, explosives, and military tactics, {{in which he}} wrote that guerrilla warfare involved [...] "sacrifice for Allah". He took extensive notes on, and made sketches of, various weaponry mechanisms and attack strategies (including Heckler & Koch submachine guns, the M16 assault rifle, RPG-7 grenade launcher, anti-tank rockets, and VIP security infiltration). Letters to his family detailed his training:I learnt about weapons such as ballistic missiles, surface to surface and <b>shoulder</b> <b>fired</b> missiles, anti aircraft and anti-tank rockets, rapid fire heavy and light machine guns, pistols, AK47s, mines and explosives.

50|$|Another {{important}} moment {{inspired by}} actual events is {{the execution of}} a village priest for acting in favour of the Fascist side: he has broken the seal of confessions, telling the fascists where the anarchists were hiding and causing their deaths. The priest is also shown to have a bruised <b>shoulder</b> from <b>firing</b> a rifle.|$|R
50|$|Vehicle mounted {{version for}} all QW series of missiles, {{development}} of CQW-2. In addition to QW series of missiles, other Chinese built MANPAD missiles such as HN-5 series and FN-6 series {{can also be}} used (though for QW-3, the launcher must be modified to accommodate the larger missile). The missiles are also mounted a high mobility 4 x 4 armored vehicle with same configuration, and the speed of the vehicle is greater than 85 km per hour and range is slightly greater than 600 km. The fire control system also works in the way similar to that of CQW-2, and the radar of FLV-1 has a range of 18+ km. The reaction of the entire system is less than 8 seconds. The missiles of FLV-1 can be directly removed from the vehicle mount and rapidly used by infantry in the field as <b>shoulder</b> <b>fired</b> missiles.|$|R
5000|$|The Folgore can be {{operated}} in two configurations. The first is as a <b>shoulder</b> <b>fired</b> weapon, {{where it has}} a maximum effective range of 500 meters. The other and more commonly used configuration when the Folgore began production in the 1980s is with the weapon mounted on a bipod or tripod with a coincidence type of range finder by Officine Galileo, which imposes a blinking light dot in the gunners sight, showing the gunner the time of flight and the aim point and the true impact point, similar to the type developed for the early Swedish Carl Gustav. [...] Today there are many laser rangefinders offered by various firms for even greater accuracy at longer ranges. This configuration requires a two-man crew and allows effective fire at ranges up to 1,000 meters. [...] The weapon is fitted with a 5x scope, a night vision sight can also be mounted.|$|R
5000|$|Since the {{beginning}} of November 2003 military helicopters have also been increasingly targeted.The insurgents, often concealed in palm groves, lie in wait for the helicopters and then attack the helicopter, usually from the rear. The weapons used include rocket-propelled grenades and heat-seeking <b>shoulder</b> <b>fired</b> missiles such as the SA-7, SA-14, and in one case the SA-16. Countermeasures taken by helicopter pilots, such as flying very low at a high speed, have considerably {{reduced the number of}} helicopters shot down, by reducing the time of target acquisition. Recently, the tactic of flying low has increased the vulnerability of these vehicles to [...]50 caliber machine gun fire. Helicopters, including Apache gunships, have been severely damaged or destroyed when multiple machine gunners have engaged helicopters at close ranges of 50-400 meters. At this range, the kinetic energy of these bullets is sufficient to penetrate the helicopter's armor.|$|R
50|$|The {{family is}} {{built in a}} bullpup layout (the action is behind the trigger group), with a forward-mounted pistol grip. The main {{advantage}} {{of this type of}} arrangement is the overall compactness of the weapon, which can be achieved without compromising the barrel length, hence the overall length of the L85 rifle is shorter than a carbine, but the barrel length is that of an assault rifle. However, the adoption of this layout also means that the rifle must be used exclusively right-handed since the ejection port and cocking handle (which reciprocates during firing) are {{on the right side of}} the receiver, making aimed fire from the left shoulder difficult. This can also give rise to a tactical disadvantage when firing around the left side of cover, where the shooter must expose the majority of his body. However left <b>shoulder</b> <b>firing</b> can be achieved by tilting the right hand side of the rifle downwards, reducing the impediments of the cocking handle and the ejection port.|$|R
5000|$|The ground force {{utilizes}} {{a variety}} of <b>shoulder</b> <b>fired</b> missiles, recoilless rifles and anti-tank guided missiles to provide infantry and mechanized units with an anti-armor capability. The 82mm B-300 is a reusable man-portable anti-tank shoulder-fired missile system. The 84mm AT4 is an unguided projectile that can destroy armor and bunkers at ranges up to 500 meters. The 90mm C90-CR is a disposable, shoulder-fired and one-man operated grenade launcher. Some motorized units are supported by the Pvpj 1110 and M40-A1 recoilless rifles that are mounted on high-mobility utility vehicles. The 115mm MILAN-2 with the night-firing ability and 148mm MAPATS laser-beam riding anti-tank guided missiles are the ground forces main anti-tank weapon systems. The purchase of the 127mm FGM-148 Javelin fire-and-forget anti-tank missiles will increase the ground forces anti-armor units capabilities. The 90mm Mistral is an infrared homing surface-to-air missile, [...] which along with the 23mm ZU-23-2 twin-barreled anti-aircraft cannons mounted on trucks make up {{the backbone of the}} defence forces air defence.|$|R
5000|$|The {{next day}} the air force lost an Mi-17 Helicopter to a <b>shoulder</b> <b>fired</b> missile near Tololing, killing the crew of four. This {{resulted}} in a change in strategy and technology. With the Israelis providing around 100 Laser-guided bomb kits to the Indian Military, the air force chose to make maximum use of this and retaliated with regular sorties on Pakistani occupied bunkers. The aircraft operated at 10,000 meters AGL (33,000 feet above sea level), well out of MANPADs range, leading to {{a drop in the}} accuracy rate of the bombs. The low number of airstrips for take off and landing of the flights also constrained the efficiency of the attacks. Despite this, there were hundreds of sorties on the intruders with no further material or personnel casualties enabling a gradual takeover of the mountain posts by Indian troops. According to IAF the [...] "air strikes against the Pakistani infiltrators, supply camps and other targets yielded rich dividends." ...|$|R
