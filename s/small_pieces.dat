5|$|A wooden motor barge, the Halfren of 1913, {{was also}} used in the {{demolition}} work, for collecting <b>small</b> <b>pieces</b> of wreckage. Worn out by this work and the frequent groundings, it was abandoned on the shore at Aust.|$|E
5|$|By 1897, Maundy {{recipients}} {{were being}} urged {{to sell the}} <b>small</b> <b>pieces</b> at a premium; there are tales of Americans paying high prices for a set that year, wanting a souvenir of Victoria's Diamond Jubilee.|$|E
30|$|The {{challenge}} is to model an infinite <b>small</b> <b>piece</b> of telegraph wire as an electric circuit since it has a load and a source as indicated by Ohm’s and Kirchhoff’s laws. The characteristics of a <b>small</b> <b>piece</b> of telegraph wire and that of a long transmission line are the same, thus it is sufficient to model an infinite <b>small</b> <b>piece</b> of telegraph wire to represent a transmission line over distance.|$|R
50|$|A {{theoretical}} model considered by Planck {{consists of a}} cavity with perfectly reflecting walls, initially with no material contents, into which is then put a <b>small</b> <b>piece</b> of carbon. Without the <b>small</b> <b>piece</b> of carbon, {{there is no way}} for non-equilibrium radiation initially in the cavity to drift towards thermodynamic equilibrium. When the <b>small</b> <b>piece</b> of carbon is put in, it transduces amongst radiation frequencies so that the cavity radiation comes to thermodynamic equilibrium.|$|R

5|$|All cnidarians can regenerate, {{allowing}} them to recover from injury and to reproduce asexually. Medusae have limited ability to regenerate, but polyps can do so from <b>small</b> <b>pieces</b> or even collections of separated cells. This enables corals to recover even after apparently being destroyed by predators.|$|E

There are several large {{interior}} holes and edge tears. A few pieces of plant material have adhered to the surface. A very <b>small</b> <b>piece</b> of cleaner linen fabric was found with this fragment. There is a small purple stain on the <b>small</b> <b>piece...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the name remains uncertain, but one {{suggestion}} {{is that it may}} derive from the word platt, meaning a <b>small</b> <b>piece</b> of ground, with miles being a corruption of mills. Hence Miles Platting may mean [...] "mills on a <b>small</b> <b>piece</b> of ground".|$|R

5|$|In the 1960s, {{while living}} in Palm Beach, Florida, Kalep began {{creating}} leather artworks which she sold to her neighbours to make a living. She created three-dimensional paintings made out of <b>small</b> <b>pieces</b> of coloured leather imported from France. Throughout the 1970s she showcased her art in exhibitions across the United States and sold works to high-profile customers including Eugene Ormandy.|$|E
5|$|Ba Cụt was {{publicly}} guillotined on 13 July 1956, in Cần Thơ. His {{body was}} later diced into <b>small</b> <b>pieces,</b> {{which were then}} buried separately. Some followers, led by a deputy named Bảy Đớm, retreated to a small area beside the Cambodian border, where they vowed not to rest until Ba Cụt was avenged. Many of his followers later joined the Việt Cộng—the movement that succeeded the Việt Minh their leader had fought—and took up arms against Diệm.|$|E
5|$|Burial 68 {{was found}} in the centre of the Group 18 plaza. The corpse was poorly preserved, it was laid out on its back with the skull towards the north. The remains were covered with <b>small</b> <b>pieces</b> of {{limestone}} mixed with brown soil. A piece of the upper jaw indicated that the remains were those of a child aged between 5 and 10 years old. Four ceramic pieces were deposited as an offering; two plates, an earthenware bowl and a bowl. Burial 68 is dated to the Late Preclassic.|$|E

Included among the <b>smaller</b> <b>pieces</b> was Basayev’s prosthetic lower right leg, which would lead FSB Director Nikolai Patrushev to confidently assert that Basayev was dead even before positive identification.|$|R
5|$|E. rabborum was {{remarkable}} {{in that the}} males appeared to provide nutrition to the tadpoles directly. During the day, the males backed into the tadpole-filled water of the tree holes and remained in that half-submerged state until night. During this time, the tadpoles swam around them, rasping <b>small</b> <b>pieces</b> of skin from their fathers' backs and eating them. This was the first observed instance of any frog species doing this, though it {{was similar to the}} way some female caecilians feed their young.|$|E
5|$|Foreign bodies, {{especially}} <b>small</b> <b>pieces</b> of hay or straw, {{can become}} {{lodged in the}} eyes of guinea pigs, resulting in excessive blinking, tearing, and in some cases an opaque film over the eye due to corneal ulcer. Hay or straw dust can also cause sneezing. While it is normal for guinea pigs to sneeze periodically, frequent sneezing may be a symptom of pneumonia, especially in response to atmospheric changes. Pneumonia may also be accompanied by torticollis and can be fatal.|$|E
5|$|Frank was autopsied twice, {{the second}} time to recover debris {{embedded}} in his body. The autopsy revealed that his lower extremities had been ripped off; his muscle tissue was extensively mutilated and torn; <b>small</b> <b>pieces</b> of wire, brass, and miscellaneous articles including a hat ornament were imbedded in various limbs; {{the fingers of his}} right hand were fractured and the bones splintered; and the distal phalanx of each finger on his left hand were missing. The coroner also observed numerous patches of blackened areas, similar to close-range gunshot residue. Four human finger bones were discovered among the wreckage at the primary crash site.|$|E

5|$|Music with a fast {{rhythm of}} 120 bpm {{was used in}} an attempt to keep the teams walking quickly around the stadium, and this was {{reinforced}} by the drummers in the stadium; nevertheless the parade part of the programme took 1 hour 40 minutes to complete, compared to the 1 hour 29 minutes estimated in the official media guide. Once all of the athletes were inside the stadium, 7 billion <b>small</b> <b>pieces</b> of paper were dropped from a Westland helicopter, each piece representing one person on Earth.|$|E
5|$|On 27 October, {{the same}} day Rhys-Davids died in action, a British {{intelligence}} officer finally gained access to the wreckage after it had lain {{a month in the}} open. He verified it was a triplane, and noted that its upper surfaces were camouflage green and its bottom surfaces were blue. Second Lieutenant Barfoot-Saunt removed some <b>small</b> <b>pieces</b> from the wreck to accompany his report, illustrating technical points. The technical information that was reported gave the British their first insight into the new craft, although Voss had swapped in a French Le Rhone engine.|$|E
5|$|Risotto is a dish {{made using}} Italian short-grain rice, {{which is both}} highly {{absorbent}} and resistant to turning into a pudding when cooked with stock and flavoured with onions and garlic, cooked in butter. Anna Gosetti della Salda's book of Italian regional cookery lists 37 risotto recipes, 18 {{of them from the}} Veneto. Variations among Veneto risottos include additions of fish and white wine; chicken; eel; mushrooms and grated Parmesan cheese; quails; <b>small</b> <b>pieces</b> of beef; courgettes (zucchini); clams; ragù; beans; mussels; prawns; cuttlefish; and asparagus.|$|E

5|$|The Akutan Zero was {{destroyed}} during a training accident in February 1945. While the Zero was taxiing for a take-off, a Curtiss SB2C Helldiver lost control and rammed into it. The Helldiver's propeller sliced the Zero into pieces. From the wreckage, William N. Leonard salvaged several gauges, which he {{donated to the}} National Museum of the United States Navy. The Alaska Heritage Museum and the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum also have <b>small</b> <b>pieces</b> of the Zero.|$|E
5|$|A hamster {{in captivity}} can {{occasionally}} eat mealworms or earthworms, which have high protein contents. Boiled {{egg whites and}} <b>small</b> <b>pieces</b> of clean, cooked chicken are also sources of extra protein. They can also eat wheat grain, sunflower seeds, and locusts. The teeth of Campbell's dwarf hamster never stop growing. Like all rodents, they must therefore gnaw regularly to keep their incisors from growing into {{the skin of the}} mouth and causing pain and irritation. Smooth, young wood from nontoxic trees, such as apple and willow, is readily used by most species in the genus. Most pet stores sell nontoxic wooden chews designed for rodents in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the props}} in The Wrath of Khan had been reused from The Motion Picture, or scrounged from other productions, but for The Search for Spock Winter wanted to design uniquely Star Trek items. George and artist Phil Norwood collaborated {{on many of}} the prop designs, {{creating}} updated and sleeker versions of the original television series communicators and phasers. Many props were created out of wood and embellished with <b>small</b> <b>pieces</b> from model kits. While the Federation tricorder was created using a model race car body, the Klingon props were intended to look dirtier, with sharp surfaces that looked uncomfortable to carry. George was insistent on using the shapes and materials, rather than blinking lights, to suggest the props were real and manufactured.|$|E
