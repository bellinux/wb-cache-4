500|$|Some {{meteorological}} {{processes are}} too small-scale or too complex to be explicitly included in {{numerical weather prediction}} models. Parameterization is a procedure for representing these processes by relating them to variables on the scales that the model resolves. For example, the gridboxes in weather and climate models have sides that are between [...] and [...] in length. [...] A typical cumulus cloud has a scale of less than , and would require a grid even finer than this to be represented physically by the equations of fluid motion. [...] Therefore, the processes that such clouds represent are parameterized, by processes of various sophistication. [...] In the earliest models, if a column of air within a model gridbox was conditionally unstable (essentially, the bottom was warmer and moister than the top) and the water vapor content at any point within the column became saturated {{then it would be}} overturned (the warm, moist air would begin rising), and the air in that vertical column mixed. [...] More sophisticated schemes recognize that only some portions of the box might convect and that entrainment and other processes occur. [...] Weather models that have gridboxes with sides between [...] can explicitly represent convective clouds, although they need to parameterize cloud microphysics which occur at a smaller scale. [...] The formation of large-scale (stratus-type) clouds is more physically based; they form when the relative humidity reaches some prescribed value. [...] <b>Sub-grid</b> scale processes need to be taken into account. [...] Rather than assuming that clouds form at 100% relative humidity, the cloud fraction can be related to a critical value of relative humidity less than 100%, reflecting the sub grid scale variation that occurs in the real world.|$|E

Space is modeled as a 2 D grid and the mobile robot path is unknown a priori. In this case, the exhaustive state space exploration of model-checking leads to the generation of many possible movements.

We show {{that the use of}} hierarchical clusters enables small cells to be tracked over short periods of time while using the movement of the larger scale features they are embedded in for longer periods. The motion estimator has been applied both to reflectivity data obtained from the National Weather Service Radar (WSR- 88 D) and to cloud-top infrared temperatures obtained from the GOES- 11 satellite. We demonstrate the results on both these sensors. 1. Short-term forecast methods The operational way of identifying storms from radar images involves the use of multiple thresholds and counting runs of values above a threshold along a radial. The centroids are then used as proxy for the storms (Johnson et al. 1998) and tracked either on the basis of proximity to expected position or through a a linear programming approach (Dixon 1994).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a grid-based distributed event detection scheme for wireless sensor networks. The network {{is divided into}} square-shaped grids of predefined grid size, where sensor nodes in each grid form a cluster with a cluster head. Event detection at each grid alone based on the readings of its member nodes is limited in event detection performance, especially for a small event region compared to the grid size. To improve the performance, each grid is further divided into 2 × 2 <b>sub-grids</b> of equal size. The decision on an event is made by finding a square region of 2 × 2 <b>sub-grids,</b> not necessarily in the same grid, that passed a predefined threshold. This process is conducted at each cluster head in a distributed manner by inter-cluster communications. Event detection is initiated when a cluster head receives an alarm from its member nodes. The cluster-head communicates with its neighboring cluster heads to exchange the number of nodes reporting an alarm. The threshold for event detection can be dynamically adjusted to reflect the number of sensor nodes in a grid and event size, if known. High event detection accuracy is achieved with a relatively low threshold without sacrificing false alarm rate by filtering most errors due to transient faults and isolating nodes with permanent faults. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed scheme can achieve high detection accuracy, while maintaining low false alarm rate...|$|R
