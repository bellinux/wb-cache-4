In the first part of my work I have studied the solutions to the problems of rotation measuring, followed by description of the stroboscopic effect. Individual chapter presents a market research of the commercial strobe tachometers. The practical part proposes and designs an own stroboscope. The stroboscope allows manual adjustment, external synchronization, phase shifting. Electronics is controlled by a microcontroller from Atmel, the light source are power LEDs. It was designed a two-sided circuit board by using Eagle Professional 6. 1. 0. The circuit board was brought to function by planting the components on it. Development continued by creating the driving program for the microcontroller. The end result of my work is functional <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>tachometer</b> in a box together with the necessary electronic components serving for its proper functioning...|$|E

The tunnel arrived at the University in 1947 and over the following few years the tunnel was heavily modified. The tunnel - which was originally designed to be operated in the horizontal plane - was converted into a vertical loop tunnel and the length was reduced by half. The original observation window was modified and two more added. Because of damage, a new impeller was constructed and numerous pieces of measuring equipment were added. This equipment included pitot tubes, a <b>tachometer,</b> <b>stroboscopic</b> lighting equipment, contact meters and a vacuum pump. The tunnel was connected to an electrical supply in 1949 and entered service late in 1950, after technical problems called for recalibration {{of some of the}} instruments. The Cavitation Tunnel is still housed in Newcastle University's old boiler house, where it was originally reconstructed.|$|R
