5|$|Even though Uncle Tom's Cabin was {{the best-selling}} {{novel of the}} 19th century, far more Americans of that time saw the <b>story</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> stage play or musical than read the book. Eric Lott, in his book Uncle Tomitudes: Racial Melodrama and Modes of Production, {{estimates}} that at least three million people saw these plays, ten times the book's first-year sales.|$|E

5|$|In {{a preview}} of the TGS demo, Ryan Geddes of IGN was left excited as to where the game would go after {{completing}} the demo, along with enjoying the improved visuals over Valkyria Chronicles II. Kotaku's Richard Eisenbeis was highly positive about the game, citing is <b>story</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> return to form after Valkyria Chronicles II and its gameplay being the best in the series. His main criticisms were its length and gameplay repetition, along with expressing regret {{that it would not be}} localized.|$|E

5|$|The Sundance Channel airings {{attracted}} more viewers in the 18-to-24 age range than was usual for their audience, which typically comprised men over age 25. After the second episode aired, cultural critic Lee Siegel {{wrote about the}} show for The New Republic. He pontificated on transgender experience, and characterized the <b>story</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> unique form of drama or tragedy. In his introduction, he commented on the general absence of reviews for the show in major news publications.|$|E
5|$|Vaan was {{conceptualized}} {{as the main}} character for Final Fantasy XII in order to contrast the older hero from Square's previous title Vagrant <b>Story</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of negative feedback received by fans. Critical reception to Vaan's character has been mixed {{as a result of}} his lack of involvement with the Final Fantasy XIIs plot although various video game publications still found him likable.|$|E
5|$|According to Sundaram Balachander's wife Shanta Balachander, the {{director}} had watched Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon (1950) at a film festival, {{was inspired by}} it, and wrote a play in the same narrative style, but the script was rejected by All India Radio. Balachander later approached A. V. Meiyappan, the founder of AVM Productions, and narrated the story for him. Although Meiyappan agreed to produce the <b>story</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> film, he was unconvinced with Balachander's idea of making it without songs or stunts; however, he agreed to finance the project because he liked the story and trusted Balachander's talent. Andha Naal thus became the first Tamil film {{that did not have}} any songs or dance sequences, and was the only film directed by Balachander for AVM Productions.|$|E

5|$|Benicio del Toro as Fred Fenster. Spacey {{suggested}} del Toro for the role. The {{character was}} originally written with a Harry Dean Stanton-type actor in mind. Del Toro met with Singer and the film's casting director {{and told them}} {{that he did not want}} to audition because he did not feel comfortable doing them. After reading the script, del Toro realized that his character's only purpose was to be killed to demonstrate Söze's power, and did not have any meaningful impact on the <b>story.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, del Toro developed Fenster's unique, garbled speech pattern to make him more memorable as a character.|$|E
5|$|Chinese {{historians have}} long debated whether Hanpu was of Silla, Goryeo, or Jurchen ethnicity. Since the 1980s, they have chiefly {{argued that he}} was a Jurchen who had lived in Silla, the state that had {{dominated}} the Korean peninsula until it was destroyed by Goryeo in 935. Western scholars usually treat Hanpu's <b>story</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> legend, but agree that it hints to contacts between some Jurchen clans and the states of Goryeo and Balhae (a state located between Jurchen lands and Silla until it was destroyed in 926) in the early tenth century. In Korea, a recent KBS history special treated Hanpu as a native Silla man who moved north and settled in Jurchen lands during the demise of Silla.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the series was mixed. While some reviewers praised the programme for being worthy of its publicity by focusing on history rather than spirituality, others remarked that it was dumbed down and went off on strange tangents. The reliability of the facial reconstruction was also questioned. Son of God first aired in the UK on BBC One during April 2001, where it received a viewership of sixmillion and an audience share of 25%. In the United States, the series was shown on the Discovery Channel under the name Jesus: The Complete <b>Story</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> single three-hour programme, two weeks after its UK broadcast. The show was also licensed to countries including France, Denmark and New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|Jun Maeda, {{the main}} {{scenario}} writer of Air, commented {{that in the}} early stages of Air production, it was already decided that it was to be an adult game, and he further assumes that if it was not at least first released with adult content, that it would not have been as commercially successful. Maeda also commented that he wanted to write Air to give players the chance to experience the entire <b>story</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole rather than just a sum of differing parts as typical bishōjo games do, including Kanon. While attempting to do this, Maeda also tried to simultaneously make it seem similar to typical visual novels in the same genre as Air to give the game appeal to the players who often play such games. As such, while the game incorporates stories from several characters, they are all of varying lengths.|$|E
5|$|Just {{like the}} player's pilot, {{most of the}} other {{characters}} are low-key. The non-player character Admiral Aken Bosch, however, plays a crucial part in moving the <b>story.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> prominent antagonist from the start, he sparks off a rebellion which escalates the scale of action, and brings in the other antagonist force, the Shivans, into the story. The storytelling took on a character-driven approach with expositions taking the form of cutscenes in which Bosch gives out monologues, revealing the purpose and driving forces behind his actions. A few established voice actors were brought in to give a polished touch to the voices in the game. Academy Award nominee Robert Loggia voiced the player's commanding officer, Admiral Petrarch, and Admiral Bosch was voiced by Ronny Cox. Kurtwood Smith and Stephen Baldwin participated in bit roles as well.|$|E
5|$|Marcel Pagnol's 1953 film Manon des Sources {{was four}} hours long, and {{subsequently}} cut by its distributor. The end result left Pagnol dissatisfied, {{and led him}} to retell the <b>story</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> novel. The {{first part of the}} novel, titled Jean de Florette, was an exploration of the background for the film; a prequel of sorts. Together the two volumes made up the work Pagnol called L'Eau des collines (The Water of the Hills). Berri came across Pagnol's book by chance in a hotel room, and was captivated by it. He decided that in order to do the story justice it had to be made in two parts.|$|E

5|$|Moore {{used the}} <b>story</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> means to reflect {{contemporary}} anxieties and to deconstruct and parody the superhero concept. Watchmen depicts an alternate history where superheroes {{emerged in the}} 1940s and 1960s and their presence changed history so that the United States won the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal was never exposed. In 1985, the country is edging toward World War III with the Soviet Union, freelance costumed vigilantes have been outlawed and most former superheroes are in retirement or working for the government. The story focuses on the personal development and moral struggles of the protagonists as {{an investigation into the}} murder of a government-sponsored superhero pulls them out of retirement.|$|E
5|$|Son of God was {{distributed}} by the BBC, who broadcast the show on BBC One. It premiered in the UK at 9:10p.m. on 1 April 2001, and ran for a single series of three episodes, with each episode being shown weekly on Sunday nights. As well as being shown in the UK, Son of God was also licensed to New Zealand and seven European territories, including France and Denmark. In the United States, the show was aired by the Discovery Channel under the name Jesus: The Complete <b>Story,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> single three-hour special at 8p.m. on 15 April, two weeks after its UK broadcast. It was also repeated in the US on Christmas Day 2002 and 2003.|$|E
5|$|The Missing Link {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Destructoid's Maurice Tan enjoyed the story despite it not adding {{anything to the}} overall experience of Human Revolution and noted that the major choices lacked impact. Simon Parkin of Eurogamer found no strong narrative hook, feeling it existed more to plug the main game's narrative gap. GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd praised the story for its emotive moments and strong voice acting. Official Xbox Magazines Edwin Evans-Thirlwell found the plot undermined by the villain and some poor dialogue. Tom Francis of PC Gamer, while giving minimal comment on the <b>story</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole, noted {{that it had a}} strong conclusion.|$|E
