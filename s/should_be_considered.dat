5|$|Although Sedna {{is officially}} {{considered}} a scattered-disc object by the MPC, its discoverer Michael E. Brown {{has suggested that}} because its perihelion distance of 76 AU is too distant {{to be affected by}} the gravitational attraction of the outer planets it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> an inner-Oort-cloud object rather than a member of the scattered disc. This classification of Sedna as a detached object is accepted in recent publications.|$|E

5|$|As Kupfer explains, Rehm did {{not justify}} why he {{believed}} Urnula craterium should be allied to Geopyxis, or why Podophacidium terrestre <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> an Urnula. Kupfer's macro- and microscopic {{analysis of tissues}} from these and related genera clearly showed the inconsistency in Rehm's taxonomical choices, and that Urnula craterium represented an entirely different genus not related to Geopyxis; Fries's naming was restored.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} above, John Scannella {{had argued}} in 2010 that Nedoceratops <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> a synonym of Triceratops. Andrew Farke (2011) maintained {{that it represents}} a valid distinct genus. Nick Longrich agreed with Scannella about Nedoceratops and made a further suggestion: that the recently described Ojoceratops was likewise a synonym. The fossils, he argued, are indistinguishable from the T. horridus specimens that were previously attributed to the defunct species T. serratus.|$|E
5|$|Atmospheric {{pressure}} changes due {{to change}} of altitude {{before or after}} diving can have a significant influence on decompression risk. Diving at high altitude requires special consideration in decompression planning. Such variations in ambient pressure caused by flying or surface travel involving changes in altitude will affect decompression and <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> during dive planning and therefore may influence a planned dive profile.|$|E

5|$|Dromaeosauroides {{has been}} {{considered}} an indeterminate dromaeosaur by some scientists. Bonde responded that since the teeth {{differ from those of}} other dromaeosaurs from the Early Cretaceous (and later members of the group, including Dromaeosaurus), it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> valid. He also said that these scientists had provided incorrect information about the location, strata and age of the specimen, and that the circumstances of its naming were no different from those of other tooth-based taxa.|$|E
5|$|Johann Georg Wagler {{gave the}} species its current {{binomial}} name in 1832 when he erected the new genus Eudocimus, whose only other species is the scarlet ibis (E.ruber). There {{has long been}} debate on whether the two <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> subspecies or closely related species, and the American Ornithologists' Union considers the two to be a superspecies as they are parapatric.

In this analysis, V.surrecta formed a subclade with V.hypopithys. Almost 90 years earlier, Paul Konrad and André Maublanc recognized the relatedness of these species, and proposed that V.surrecta <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> a subspecies of V.hypopithys.|$|E
