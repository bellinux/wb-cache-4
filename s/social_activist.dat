40|$|Abstract Networks of <b>social</b> <b>activists</b> {{traditionally}} lack {{financial and}} human resources, {{resulting in low}} interest in employing sophisticated IT. There are not many studies describing the {{development and use of}} computer systems for networks of <b>social</b> <b>activists.</b> Especially with regard to web 2. 0 applications, it is interesting to analyze how <b>social</b> <b>activists</b> appropriate <b>social</b> web platforms. In this paper we describe the usage of a collaborative platform called “OpenESF ” by <b>social</b> <b>activists</b> taking part in the European Social Forum. The results of this study will provide us with an understanding of the needs of <b>social</b> <b>activists</b> for effective computer support and highlight directions for the redesign of OpenESF...|$|R

5|$|As a Republican {{representing}} heavily-Democratic Maryland, Mathias faced {{a potentially}} difficult re-election {{bid for the}} 1974 election. State Democrats nominated Barbara Mikulski, then a Baltimore City Councilwoman who was well-known to residents in her city as a <b>social</b> <b>activist,</b> but with limited name recognition {{in the rest of}} the state. Mathias was renominated by Republicans, fending off a primary election challenge from conservative doctor Ross Pierpont. Pierpont was never a substantial threat to Mathias, whose lack of competition was due in part to fallout from the Watergate scandal.|$|E

40|$|We {{argue that}} when {{stakeholder}} protection {{is left to}} the voluntary initiative of managers, concessions to <b>social</b> <b>activists</b> and pressure groups can turn into a self-entrenchment strategy for incumbent CEOs. Stakeholders other than shareholders thus bene¯t from corporate governance rules putting managers under a tough replacement threat. We show that a minimal amount of formal stakeholder protection, or the introduction of explicit covenants protecting stakeholder rights in the ¯rm charter, may deprive CEOs of the alliance with powerful <b>social</b> <b>activists,</b> thus increasing managerial turnover and shareholder value. These results rationalize a recent trend whereby well-known <b>social</b> <b>activists</b> like Friends of the Earth and active shareholders like CalPERS are showing a growing support for each other's agendas...|$|R

40|$|As {{part of the}} {{movement}} to "construct a new socialist countryside", Chinese officials and <b>social</b> <b>activists</b> are experimenting with transforming rural social and economic relations. They often draw on discourses {{dating back to the}} Rural Reconstruction Movement of the 1920 s and 1930 s, which saw urban intellectuals making similar efforts to modernize the villages and their inhabitants. This paper analyses the different types of relationships between the state, <b>social</b> <b>activists,</b> and villagers in a number of rural reconstruction projects. The state is still the major player in this field, but traditional top-down procedures are often perceived to be unproductive when it comes to micro-level community building, so state actors are forced to find allies among village elites and <b>social</b> <b>activists...</b>|$|R
