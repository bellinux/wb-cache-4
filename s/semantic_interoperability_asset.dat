40|$|The {{application}} of Semantic Web technologies to service-oriented architectures (SOA) {{has promised to}} mitigate the problem of achieving <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> as the formal definition of semantics paves the way for higher automation in the mediation process between heterogeneous services. Recently, many ontology-based approaches for <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> have been developed. However, it remains difficult to compare the various approaches because only domain-specific conceptual frameworks for <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> exist. Moreover, in SOA practice ontology-based approaches are not widely adopted but still XML-based solutions are dominant. This paper targets to fill this gap and presents ongoing work towards a general conceptual framework for <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> in SOA {{as a foundation for}} comparative reflection. Based on the framework selected approaches both academic and industry-driven are compared. Furthermore, an inherent trade-off between efficiency an d effectiveness in achieving <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> is identified and a potential alleviation based on semantic mediation on domain level is outlined...|$|R

Other studies, of the construction industry and of the automobile manufacturing supply chain, estimate costs of over US$10 billion per year {{due to lack of}} <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> in those industries.

40|$|In {{advent of}} the Semantic Web and recent {{standardization}} efforts, Ontology has quickly become a popular and core semantic technology. Ontology {{is seen as a}} solution provider to knowledge based systems. It facilitates tasks such as knowledge sharing, reuse and intelligent processing by computer agents. A key problem addressed by Ontology is the <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> problem. Interoperability in general is a common problem in different domain applications and <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> is the hardest and an ongoing research problem. It is required for systems to exchange knowledge and having the meaning of the knowledge accurately and automatically interpreted by the receiving systems. The innovation is to allow knowledge to be consumed and used accurately {{in a way that is}} not foreseen by the original creator. While Ontology promotes <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> across systems by unifying their knowledge bases through consensual understanding, common engineering and processing practices, it does not solve the <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> problem at the global level. As individuals are increasingly empowered with tools, ontologies will eventually be created more easily and rapidly at a near individual scale. Global <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> between heterogeneous ontologies created by small groups of individuals will then be required. 	Ontology mapping is a mechanism for providing semantic bridges between ontologies. While ontology mapping promotes <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> across ontologies, it is seen as the solution provider to the global <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> problem. However, there is no single ontology mapping solution that caters for all problem scenarios. Different applications would require different mapping techniques. 	In this thesis, we analyze the relations between ontology, <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> and ontology mapping, and promote an ontology-based <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> solution. We propose a novel ontology mapping approach namely, OntoMogic. It is based on first order logic and model theory. OntoMogic supports approximate mapping and produces structures (approximate entity correspondence) that represent alignment results between concepts. OntoMogic has been implemented as a coherent system and is applied in different application scenarios. We present case studies in the network configuration, security intrusion detection and IT governance & compliance management domain. The full process of ontology engineering to mapping has been demonstrated to promote ontology-based <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability...</b>|$|R

40|$|In cloud {{computing}} environments, {{one of the}} most important barriers to the adoption of software as a service systems is interoperability. Generally, in {{cloud computing}} environments at software as a service level, interoperability refers to the ability of software as a service systems on one cloud provider to communicate with software as a service systems on another cloud provider. The current software as a service systems in cloud computing environments have not been built with interoperability as a primary concern. Software as a service systems in cloud computing environments are poorly developed to meet the interoperability challenges. A common tactic for enabling interoperability is the use of an interoperability framework or model. During the past few years, at software as a service level, various interoperability frameworks and models have been developed to provide interoperability between systems. The syntactic interoperability of software as a service systems have already been intensively researched. However, not enough consideration has been given to <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> issues. Both syntactic and <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> are necessary prerequisites to achieve <b>interoperability.</b> Achieving <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> is a challenge within the world of software as a service in cloud computing environments. Therefore, a <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> framework for software as a service systems in cloud computing environments is needed. In this thesis, we develop a <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> framework for software as a service systems in cloud computing environments. For this purpose, we illustrate how current technologies, such as service oriented architecture, can represent an adequate foundation for implementing such framework. The capabilities and value of service oriented architecture for <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> between software as a service systems in cloud computing environments will be studied and demonstrated. iv In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> framework for software as a service systems in cloud computing environments, extensive experimentation and statistical analysis have been performed. Overall, the effectiveness of <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> of software as a service systems in cloud computing environments with the proposed framework shows a significant improvement in comparison with the existing models and frameworks...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to compare two major international standardisation approaches that enable <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> in electronic health record (EHR), to identify harmonisation efforts between the two approaches and to suggest possibilities on future harmonisation. Archetypes and HL 7 are the two major approaches in current Electronic Health Record development, but their approaches to <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> are very different. Many countries, organisations, and companies have adopted the overlapping approaches. It is very difficult for systems adopting different approaches to communicate. Harmonisation is one possible way other than replacing each other to settle this issue. The thesis first presents overviews on <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> in information system, electronic health records and international interoperability standards. Then, detail studies in the two approaches are conducted by reviewing articles and international standards. A set of prerequisites of <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> is used to evaluate the approaches. Finally, differences between the two approaches and harmonisation efforts are identified.

The issue at hand is one of ensuring <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> between actors from disparate contexts.

40|$|Objectives: In {{the field}} of open {{electronic}} health records (EHRs), openEHR as an archetype-based approach is being increasingly recognised. It is {{the objective of this}} paper to shortly describe this approach, and to analyse how openEHR archetypes impact on health professionals and <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability.</b> Methods: Analysis of current approaches to EHR systems, terminology and standards developments. In addition to literature reviews, we organised face-to-face and additional telephone interviews and tele-conferences with members of relevant organisations and committees. Results: The openEHR archetypes approach enables syntactic <b>interoperability</b> and <b>semantic</b> interpretability – both important prerequisites for <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability.</b> Archetypes enable the formal definition ofclinical content by clinicians. To enable comprehensive <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability,</b> the development and maintenance of archetypes needs to be coordinated internationally and across health professions. Domain knowledge governance comprises a set of processes that enable the creation, development, organisation, sharing, dissemination, use and continuous maintenance of archetypes. It needs to be supported by information technology. Conclusions: To enable EHRs, <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> is essential. The openEHR archetypes approach enables syntactic <b>interoperability</b> and <b>semantic</b> interpretability. However, without coordinated archetype development and maintenance, ‘rank growth’ of archetypes would jeopardize <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability.</b> We therefore believe that openEHR archetypes and domain knowledge governance together create the knowledge environment required to adopt EHRs...|$|R
40|$|Sharing {{information}} and knowledge among heterogeneous health information systems requires <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability.</b> Most integration projects address <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> by implementing HL 7 version 3 standard interfaces. However, {{it is challenging to}} achieve computable <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> with HL 7 because of i) {{the complexity of}} the standard, requiring HL 7 experts in the interface implementation process ii) inconsistencies and overlapping of the different HL 7 information models (RIM, D-MIMs, R-MIMs, C-METs), and iii) instability of the different HL 7 version 3 models. In this paper, an ontology-based service for health systems´ <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> is proposed. This service includes three main components: i) the conceptual model formalization component, responsible to represent the conceptual information models of the applications to be integrated as formal application ontologies; ii) the ontology mapper component; responsible to realize the semantic mapping between the formal application ontologies using a domain ontology, therefore solving inconsistencies found in the source application ontologies; (iii) the automatic interface generator, responsible to create and to maintain HL 7 version 3 interfaces. The service presented in this paper is primary focused on the implementation of HL 7 interfaces to integrate legacy systems.

We introduce a federated semantic metadata registry framework by extending the ISO/IEC 11179 standard, and enable integration of data element registries through Linked Open Data (LOD) principles where each Common Data Element (CDE) can be uniquely referenced, queried and processed to enable the syntactic and <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability.</b> Each CDE and their components are maintained as LOD resources enabling semantic links with other CDEs, terminology systems and with implementation dependent content models; hence facilitating semantic search, much effective reuse and <b>semantic</b> <b>interoperability</b> across different application domains.
