40|$|Background. Nigeria has {{a growing}} spray {{painting}} industry, however, {{the burden of}} occupational health problems related to organic solvent exposure among <b>spray</b> <b>painters</b> in Nigeria is under-studied. Objectives. This study aimed to assess workshop characteristics and ambient concentration of total volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in spray painting workshops and to compare lung function status and total serum bile acid levels of <b>spray</b> <b>painters</b> and controls. Methods. A cross-sectional study design was employed to survey 120 <b>spray</b> <b>painters</b> and 120 controls (electronic technicians). A semi-structured questionnaire was used to obtain data on socio-demographics characteristics of the respondents. Weight, height and lung function of respondents were measured. In addition, a checklist was used to survey the spray painting workshops. Total VOC levels were determined in 37 spray painting and 31 electronic workshops. Data were analyzed using Statistical Program for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20 and a p-value of < 0. 05 {{was considered to be}} statistically significant. Results. Windows were present in only 5 (13. 5 %) spray painting workshops and 23 (62 %) workshops had a retractable tarpaulin at the entrance. Only 9 (24 %) workshops had changing rooms, while fire extinguishers and first aid kits were not present in any of the surveyed workshops. A respirator with filter was sighted in only 1 (3 %) workshop. The 8 -hour time weighted average concentration of total VOCs in spray painting workshops was 13. 4 ppm, which is above the national permissible exposure limits of 1. 9 ppm. Forced vital capacity (FVC) percent predicted was significantly lower in <b>spray</b> <b>painters</b> (93. 9 ± 10. 8 %) than controls (96. 7 ± 8. 2 %) (t = − 2. 326, df= 238 p< 0. 001). In addition, forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV 1) percent predicted was lower in <b>spray</b> <b>painters</b> (94. 6 ± 12. 2 %) than controls (100. 3 ± 9. 1 %) (t=− 4. 058, df= 238, p= 0. 002). FEV 1 /FVC% was significantly lower among <b>spray</b> <b>painters</b> (85. 48 ± 8. 70 %) compared with controls (87. 88 ± 6. 22 %) (t=− 2. 861 df= 238, p= 0. 005). Total serum bile acids was significantly elevated in painters (8. 71 ± 3. 39 mmol/l) compared to controls (4. 67 ± 2. 15 mmol/l) (t= 10. 358, df= 213, p< 0. 05).

40|$|Dermal {{contact with}} isocyanate-based {{coatings}} {{may lead to}} systemic respiratory sensitization. The most common isocyanates found in sprayed automotive coatings are monomeric and oligomeric 1, 6 -hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI). Most <b>spray</b> <b>painters</b> use thin (4 - 5 mil) latex gloves that are not effective at preventing dermal exposures when spraying isocyanate paints. Personal interviews with collision repair industry personnel and focus groups with <b>spray</b> <b>painters</b> were held to characterize risk awareness, to examine perceptions and challenges concerning protective glove use and selection, and to generate ideas for protective glove use interventions. The most popular gloves among <b>spray</b> <b>painters</b> were thin (4 - 5 mil) and thick (14 mil) latex. We found that medium to thick (6 - 8 mil) nitrile were not always perceived as comfortable and {{were expected to be}} more expensive than thin (4 - 5 mil) latex gloves. Of concern is the user's difficulty in distinguishing between nitrile and latex gloves; latex gloves are now sold in different colors including blue, which has traditionally been associated with nitrile gloves. Even though <b>spray</b> <b>painters</b> were familiar with the health hazards related to working with isocyanate paints, most were not always aware that dermal exposure to isocyanates could {{contribute to the development of}} occupational asthma.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{study the}} role of {{individual}} and occupational risk factors for asthma in furniture workers. METHODS: 296 workers were examined (258 men, 38 women) with a questionnaire of respiratory symptoms and diseases, baseline spirometry, bronchial provocative test with methacholine, and skin prick tests. Non-specific bronchial hyperreactivity was defined as when a provocative dose with a fall of 20 % in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (PD 20 FEV 1) was < 0. 8 mg and atopy {{in the presence of}} at least one positive response to skin prick tests. Workers were subdivided into <b>spray</b> <b>painters</b> (exposed to low concentrations of diisocyanates and solvents), woodworkers (exposed to wood dusts), and assemblers (control group). RESULTS: The prevalences of attacks of shortness of breath with wheezing and dyspnoea were higher in <b>spray</b> <b>painters</b> (13. 5 % and 11. 5 % respectively) than in woodworkers (7. 7 % and 6. 3 %) or in assemblers (1. 6 % and 1. 6 %); prevalences of chronic cough, asthma, and rhinitis were also slightly but not significantly higher in <b>spray</b> <b>painters</b> and in woodworkers than in assemblers. The difference in the prevalence of respiratory symptoms among the job titles was due to the atopic subjects, who showed a higher prevalence of chronic cough, wheeze, shortness of breath with wheeze, dyspnoea, and asthma in <b>spray</b> <b>painters</b> than in the other groups. The prevalence of non-specific bronchial hyperreactivity in subjects who performed bronchial provocative tests was 17. 7 %, with no significant difference among groups. Asthma symptoms were significantly associated with non-specific bronchial hyperreactivity. Asthma-like symptoms plus non-specific bronchial hyperreactivity was found in 4 % of assemblers, 10 % of woodworkers, and 13. 3 % of <b>spray</b> <b>painters</b> (chi 2 = 2. 6, NS). Multiple logistic analysis taking into account individual (smoke, atopy, age) and occupational (job titles) risk factors confirmed that <b>spray</b> <b>painters</b> had higher prevalence of chronic cough than assemblers, and a trend in increasing the prevalence of shortness of breath with wheeze, dyspnoea, and asthma. CONCLUSIONS: Painters in the furniture industry, particularly atopic subjects, are at higher risk of asthma-like symptoms than other job titles. In these workers asthma-like symptoms are more sensitive than non-specific bronchial hyperreactivity in detecting a negative effect of the occupational exposure...|$|R

40|$|Associations {{have been}} {{observed}} between exposure to isocyanates, consisting mainly of oligomers, and respiratory symptoms and isocyanate specific sensitisation in <b>spray</b> <b>painters.</b> The aim {{of the present study}} was to assess associations between isocyanate exposure and more objective respiratory effect measures such as bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), baseline spirometry and exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) in a subset of <b>spray</b> <b>painters.</b> Methacholine challenge and eNO measurements were performed in 229 workers. Questionnaires and blood samples were obtained. Specific immunoglobulin (Ig) E and IgG to hexamethylene di-isocyanate were assessed in serum using various assays. Personal exposure was estimated by combining personal task-based inhalatory exposure measurements and time-activity information. Workers with higher isocyanate exposure were more often hyperresponsive (prevalence ratio comparing the 75 th versus 25 th percentile of exposure 1. 8). In addition, significant exposure-related decreased forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), FEV 1 /forced vital capacity ratio and flow-volume parameters independent of BHR were found. BHR was more prevalent among sensitised workers. This was statistically significant for only IgG-ImmunoCAP (Phadia, Uppsala, Sweden) positive workers. eNO was not associated with exposure although slightly elevated eNO levels in specific IgG positive subjects were found.

Two field studies were conducted at an aerospace facility {{to determine the}} size distribution and speciation of Cr(VI) in paint spray aerosol. Sampled paint products consisted of sparingly soluble strontium chromate in an epoxy resin matrix, a matrix generally known for its durability and toughness. Personal aerosol samples were collected using Sierra Marple personal cascade impactors and analyzed for Cr(VI) and total Cr. The size distribution of total Cr particles in the paint aerosol had a Mass Median Aerodynamic Diameter (MMAD) of 7. 5 mm [Geometric Standard Deviation (GSD = 2. 7 mm) ] in both field studies.

Dermal concentrations of HDI, uretidone, biuret, and isocyanurate were significantly higher in 15 painters who did not wear coveralls or gloves (N = 51 paint tasks) than in 32 painters who did wear coveralls and gloves (N = 192 paint tasks) during spray painting. Regardless of whether protective clothing was worn, isocyanurate was the predominant species measured in the skin [geometric mean (GM) = 33. 8 ng mm− 3], with a 95 % detection rate. Other polyisocyanates (GM ≤ 0. 17 ng mm− 3) were detected in skin during < 23 % of the paint tasks. According to marginal R 2 statistics, mixed models generated in this study described no < 36 % of the variability in dermal concentrations of the different polyisocyanates measured in painters who did not wear protective clothing. These models also described 55 % of the variability in dermal concentrations of isocyanurate measured in all painters (N = 288 paint tasks). The product of analyte-specific breathing-zone concentration (BZC) and paint time was the most significant variable in all the models.

In the hospitability that he receives, the characteristic of complacency, and even life security seem to dwindle; the scholar begins having premonitions of death in a foreign land, which after all has been proven not so foreign since he saw the human Statue of Liberty which he {{was more likely to}} have seen from Brooklyn Bridge or Battery Park, back home. Rather than unfolding in a strictly Viennese culture the journey enters a more cosmopolitan arena with the above, and later the gypsies the traveller sees near the cathedral. He does not clarify whether he scorns the city for being non-unique in this ethnographic display of people and cultures or is grateful to it for its diversity of entrapments. However, towards the end we are shown a passage out of this binary by the author when he realizes how natively and unequivocally even Michael Jackson music in “thick German/Austrian” accent affected a lady in the wheelchair, thereby redefining the codes of travel itself. The work is an example of meta-travel wherein while the author is supposedly the traveller, and the city he treads upon was itself caught unawares in its ongoing flux. To any traveller a city is ideally a kaleidoscope sans ideological afflictions, and that is the last impression we are left with, of Vienna’s shadowed orange tiled rooftops...|$|E

Hexavalent chromium has been established as a carcinogen associated with cancers of the lung and nasal passages. Moreover, hexavalent chromium is associated with irritant and allergic contact dermatitis and gastrointestinal disorders. Previous studies have shown evidence of airborne overexposure to painters when utilizing traditional spray paint booth ventilation. The evaluation of work practices, specifically worker orientation in the spray paint booth and maintaining the proper spraying distance, may assist with further lowering the exposure to hexavalent chromium and complying with occupational exposure limits. The objectives {{of this study were}} to evaluate the effects of worker orientation within the spray paint booth and spraying distance (distance from the spray paint nozzle to the part being coated) in reducing paint aerosol exposures as a surrogate for hexavalent chromium exposure. Four orientations with respect to the flow of air into the booth were evaluated: 0 o, 45 o, 90 o, and 180 o. Three spray distances were evaluated: 3, 6, and 12 inches. Paint aerosol concentrations were measured using a Thermo Scientific PDR 1500 real-time aerosol monitor. Results showed an association between orientation and aerosol concentrations with the geometric mean concentration increasing as orientation moved from 0 o (directly upwind) to 180 o (directly downwind) : 0 o (0. 08 µg/m 3 /gram), 45 o (0. 47 µg/m 3 /gram), 90 o (2. 69 µg/m 3 /gram), and 180 o (14. 0 µg/m 3 /gram). Changing the spray distance did not reveal an association with aerosol exposure concentrations. Worker orientations that place the painter upwind of the target parts showed decreased paint aerosol exposures and potentially hexavalent chromium exposures. While additional research is required to establish the association between aerosol paint and hexavalent chromium exposures, this research suggests that optimizing <b>spray</b> <b>painter</b> work practices may aid in reducing hexavalent chromium exposures resulting from hexavalent chromium based paints and primers...|$|E
25|$|Surprisingly few artists {{used the}} spray gun {{technique}} to create large expanses and fields of color sprayed across their canvases during the 1960s and 1970s. Some painters who effectively used spray painting techniques include Jules Olitski, {{who was a}} pioneer in his spray technique that covered his large paintings with layer after layer of different colors, often gradually changing hue and value in subtle progression. Another important innovation was Dan Christensen's use of a spray technique to great effect in loops and ribbons of bright color; sprayed in clear, calligraphic marks across his large-scale paintings. William Pettet, Richard Saba, and Albert Stadler, used the technique to create large-scale fields of multi-colors; while Kenneth Showell sprayed over crumpled canvases and created an illusion of abstract still-life interiors. Most of the <b>spray</b> <b>painters</b> were active especially during the late 1960s and 1970s.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To study {{inhalation}} and {{dermal exposure}} to hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and its oligomers {{as well as}} personal protection equipment (PPE) use during task performance in conjunction with urinary hexamethylene diamine (HDA) in car body repair shop workers and industrial <b>spray</b> <b>painters.</b> Methods: Personal task based inhalation samples (n = 95) were collected from six car body repair shops and five industrial painting companies using impingers with di-n-butylamine (DBA) in toluene. In parallel, dermal exposure was assessed using nitril rubber gloves. Gloves were submerged into DBA in toluene after sampling. Analysis for HDI and its oligomers was performed by LC-MS/MS. Urine samples were collected from 55 workers (n = 291) and analysed for HDA by GC-MS. Results: Inhalation exposure was strongly associated with tasks during which aerosolisation occurs. Dermal exposure occurred during tasks that involve direct handling of paint. In car body repair shops associations were found between detectable dermal exposure and glove use (odds ratio (OR) 0. 22, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 09 to 0. 57) and inhalation exposure level (OR 1. 34, 95 % CI 0. 97 to 1. 84 for a 10 -fold increase). HDA in urine could be demonstrated in 36 % and 10 % of car body repair shop workers and industrial painting company workers respectively. In car body repair shops, the frequency of detectable HDA was significantly elevated {{at the end of}} the working day (OR 2. 13, 95 % CI 1. 07 to 4. 22 for 3 - 6 pm v 0 - 8 am). In both branches HDA was detected in urine of ∼ 25 % of the <b>spray</b> <b>painters.</b> In addition HDA was detected in urine of a large proportion of non-spray painters in car body repair shops. Conclusion: Although (spray) painting with lacquers containing isocyanate hardeners results in the highest external exposures to HDI and oligomers, workers that do not perform paint related tasks may also receive a considerable internal dose...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} exposure-response {{relationships}} between isocyanate exposure and respiratory health end-points and specific sensitization in <b>spray</b> <b>painters</b> were investigated. Isocyanates, {{a group of}} compounds characterized by reactive N=C=O groups, {{are among the most}} frequently identified causes of occupational asthma in industrialized countries. Isocyanates are used as polymerizing agents in polyurethane products, such as kits, glues, lacquers and insulation materials. <b>Spray</b> <b>painters</b> comprise a large population at risk with potentially high isocyanate exposure. Large scale (n= 566) personal task based inhalation sampling showed that hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) oligomers were dominant in frequency of occurrence and had the highest exposure levels. Exposure was highest during spray painting. Exposure to monomeric HDI was far below current occupational exposure levels. An ad hoc method was developed for dermal exposure sampling (n= 95) and showed that dermal exposure occurred during tasks that involve direct handling of paint. Personal inhalation exposure was estimated by combining results from task-based personal inhalation exposure assessment and task activity information. Association between exposure and respiratory symptoms were studied in 581 workers. Log-linear exposure-response associations were found for asthma-like symptoms (wheezing or chest tightness), COPD-like symptoms (chronic cough or phlegm or shortness of breath) and work-related chest tightness (prevalence ratios (PRs) for an interquartile range (IQR) increase in exposure of 1. 2, 1. 3 and 2. 0 respectively, p? 0. 05). Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), assessed by methacholine challenge (n= 229), was more prevalent among exposed workers than office workers and a positive association was found with exposure (PR (95 % CI) IQR: 1. 8 (1. 1 - 3. 0)). Exposure related obstructive effects on lung function, independent of BHR, were also found (FEV 1, FEV 1 /FVC and flow parameters associated with exposure, p< 0. 05). Specific IgE and IgG were assessed by various immunoassays based on HDI-HSA conjugates prepared with HDI in the liquid (HDIL) or vapor phase (HDIv), or with HDI-oligomers (N 100, N 3300) and the commercial ImmunoCAP assay (n= 581). The prevalence of specific IgE sensitization was low (up to 4. 2 % in <b>spray</b> <b>painters)</b> suggesting that at most, specific IgE plays a role in a minority of individuals with symptoms. The prevalence of specific IgG was higher (2 - 50 %) and strongly associated with exposure. When comparing the immunoassays, EIAs with HSA-conjugated HDI oligomers seemed to provide the best combination of sensitivity and specificity in this industry. This suggests that exposure to specific isocyanates should be taken into account when assessing isocyanate specific sensitization. In a subset of the population (n= 101) the use of a new cellular diagnostic test based on the production of the cytokine monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 (MCP- 1) by peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with isocyanate conjugates was explored. Crude data did not suggest that HDI-induced MCP- 1 release differed between exposure categories or between individuals with and without asthma-like symptoms, BHR or specific IgE or IgG antibodies. Taken together, the associations found in this study indicate that isocyanate oligomers can induce respiratory health effects at levels commonly found in this industry. No indications for a role of specific sensitization (IgE or IgG) were found. The results stress the importance of regulation and control of isocyanate oligomer exposure...|$|R
