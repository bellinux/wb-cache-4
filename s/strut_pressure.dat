40|$|Two {{concepts}} which {{reduce the}} A- 10 aircraft's wing/gear interface forces {{as a result}} of applying active control technology to the main landing gear are described. In the first concept, referred to as the alternate concept a servovalve in a closed pressure control loop configuration effectively varies the size of the third stage spool valve orifice which is embedded in the strut. This action allows the internal energy in the strut to shunt hydraulic flow around the metering orifice. The command signal to the loop is reference <b>strut</b> <b>pressure</b> which is compared to the measured <b>strut</b> <b>pressure,</b> the difference being the loop error. Thus, the loop effectively varies the spool valve orifice size to maintain the <b>strut</b> <b>pressure,</b> and therefore minimizes the wing/gear interface force referenced...|$|E
40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) {{seeks to}} license its Advanced Tire and <b>Strut</b> <b>Pressure</b> Monitor (TSPM) technology. The TSPM is a {{handheld}} system to accurately measure tire and <b>strut</b> <b>pressure</b> and temperature {{over a wide}} temperature range (20 to 120 OF), as well as improve personnel safety. Sensor accuracy, electronics design, and a simple user interface allow operators quick, easy access to required measurements. The handheld electronics, powered by 12 -VAC or by 9 -VDC batteries, provide the user with an easy-to-read visual display of pressure/temperature or the streaming of pressure/temperature data via an RS- 232 interface. When connected to a laptop computer, this new measurement system can provide users with automated data recording and trending, eliminating the chance for data hand-recording errors. In addition, calibration software allows for calibration data to be automatically utilized for the generation of new data conversion equations, simplifying the calibration processes that are so critical to reliable measurements. The design places a high-accuracy pressure sensor (also used as a temperature sensor) {{as close to the}} tire or strut measurement location as possible, allowing the user to make accurate measurements rapidly, minimizing the amount of high-pressure volumes, and allowing reasonable distance between the tire or strut and the operator. The pressure sensor attaches directly to the pressure supply/relief valve on the tire and/or strut, with necessary electronics contained in the handheld enclosure. A software algorithm ensures high accuracy of the device over the wide temperature range. Using the pressure sensor as a temperature sensor permits measurement of the actual temperature of the pressurized gas. This device can be adapted to create a portable calibration standard that does not require thermal conditioning. This allows accurate pressure measurements without disturbing the gas temperature. In-place calibration can save considerable time and money and is suitable in many process applications throughout industry...|$|E
40|$|Intermediate turbine ducts {{are used}} to guide the flow in {{turbofan}} engines from the short-radius high-pressure turbine to the large-radius low-pressure turbine. The demand for more efficient and silent jet engines and with a reduced environmental impact requires turbofans with increasingly higher by-pass ratios. Intermediate turbine ducts that could provide a greater radial offset in shorter length would contribute greatly to achieving this goal, especially if they maintained low pressure losses and avoided non-uniformities in the outlet flow that might affect the downstream low-pressure turbine. This thesis presents an experimental study of the flowfield and the heat transfer in an aggressive intermediate turbine duct. The goals of this research were to obtain {{an understanding of the}} mechanisms governing the heat transfer in intermediate turbine ducts; and as well, to provide detailed high-quality flow and heat transfer experimental data for CFD validation purposes. The experiments were carried out in a state-of-the-art aggressive intermediate turbine duct with structural struts in a large-scale low-speed turbine facility at realistic engine Reynolds numbers and inlet conditions. For the flow measurements, oil-film visualization, static pressure measurements, 5 -hole pressure probe and hot-wire anemometry were used. The heat transfer measurements were performed using a technique based on IR-thermography. The experiments were performed for three different turbine operating points in order to evaluate the effect of inlet swirl on the flow and heat transfer in the duct. The results showed that the stationary flow features arising from the upstream turbine had a large effect on both the flowfield and the heat transfer in the duct. The combination of tip leakage flow and structural struts gave rise to a large vortex with changing relative strength for different inlet swirl. This vortex locally dominated the heat transfer in the neighborhood of the suction side of the vane. Also, counter-rotating vortex pairs near the hub created streaks of low and high heat transfer coefficient that varied ± 20 % on the hub. For a lower inlet swirl angle, flow separation occurred at the corner between the shroud endwall and the <b>strut</b> <b>pressure</b> side due to the mismatch of the strut and flow angles in the tip leakage region. These flow separations created large circumferential variations in the duct outflow, and significantly modified the flowfield and heat transfer on the endwalls where an increase in the heat transfer coefficient of up to 25 % was seen. These and other important effects of the flowfield on the heat transfer distributions have been identified. The results provide valuable insights into duct flow phenomena and how they are coupled to the heat transfer. Together they represent a first step towards understanding the heat transfer phenomena in the duct. The results are already being used to improve design methods in industry.

40|$|The {{application}} of {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) and finite element analysis (FEA) has been growing rapidly in the various fields of science and technology. One of the areas of interest is in biomedical engineering. The altered hemodynamics inside the blood vessels {{plays a key role}} in the development of the arterial disease called atherosclerosis, which is the major cause of human death worldwide. Atherosclerosis is often treated with the stenting procedure to restore the normal blood flow. A stent is a tubular, flexible structure, usually made of metals, which is driven and expanded in the blocked arteries. Despite the success rate of the stenting procedure, it is often associated with the restenosis (re-narrowing of the artery) process. The presence of non-biological device in the artery causes inflammation or re-growth of atherosclerotic lesions in the treated vessels. Several factors including the design of stents, type of stent expansion, expansion pressure, morphology and composition of vessel wall influence the restenosis process. Therefore, the role of computational studies is crucial in the investigation and optimisation of the factors that influence post-stenting complications. This thesis focuses on the stent-vessel wall interactions followed by the blood flow in the post-stenting stage of stenosed human coronary artery. Hemodynamic and mechanical stresses were analysed in three separate stent-plaque-artery models. Plaque was modeled as a multi-layer (fibrous cap (FC), necrotic core (NC), and fibrosis (F)) and the arterial wall as a single layer domain. CFD/FEA simulations were performed using commercial software packages in several models mimicking the various stages and morphologies of atherosclerosis. The tissue prolapse (TP) of stented vessel wall, the distribution of von Mises stress (VMS) inside various layers of vessel wall, and the wall shear stress (WSS) along the luminal surface of the deformed vessel wall were measured and evaluated. The results revealed the role of the stenosis size, thickness of each layer of atherosclerotic wall, thickness of stent <b>strut,</b> <b>pressure</b> applied for stenosis expansion, and the flow condition in the distribution of stresses. The thicknesses of FC, and NC and the total thickness of plaque are critical in controlling the stresses inside the tissue. A small change in morphology of artery wall can significantly affect the distribution of stresses. In particular, FC is the most sensitive layer to TP and stresses, which could determine plaque’s vulnerability to rupture. The WSS is highly influenced by the deflection of artery, which in turn is dependent on the structural composition of arterial wall layers. Together with the stenosis size, their roles could play a decisive role in controlling the low values of WSS (< 0. 5 Pa) prone to restenosis. Moreover, the time dependent flow altered the percentage of luminal area with WSS values less than 0. 5 Pa at different time instants. The non- Newtonian viscosity model of the blood properties significantly affects the prediction of WSS magnitude. The outcomes of this investigation will help to better understand the roles of the individual layers of atherosclerotic vessels and their risk to provoke restenosis at the post-stenting stage. As a consequence, the implementation of such an approach to assess the post-stented stresses will assist the engineers and clinicians in optimizing the stenting techniques to minimize the occurrence of restenosis...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experimental study on a tractor-type podded propeller and strut. The {{focus is on}} the time varying pressure distribution around {{the leading edge of the}} strut where the propeller wake interacts strongly with the strut. Measurements were made of <b>strut</b> surface <b>pressures</b> and shaft forces on a podded propeller model at a sampling rate of 5000 Hz. Both the shaft forces and the surface pressures measured at 56 locations were broken into time-averaged and phase-averaged components. These are relevant to the propeller?s integrated and transient performance characteristics, respectively. The pressure measurements show low time-averaged pressure was concentrated in the area on the suction side around the leading edge of the <b>strut.</b> The lowest <b>pressure</b> was located near the junction of the strut and pod. The largest pressure fluctuation occurred on the leading edge where the tip-vortex impacted on the strut. The wake impingement effect on the propeller performance was evaluated based on the measurement of the propeller shaft forces. The evaluation was made by comparing the shaft forces measured over two tests with and without the installation of the pod and the strut. It showed that the presence of the pod and strut increased shaft forces and the propeller efficiency, but no significant effect on the amplitude of the phase-averaged propeller shaft forces was found.

Strips of emery cloth were wrapped in various positions around the body circumference in order to modify the thickness and characteristics of the boundary layer. The results show that the base suctions decrease with increasing boundary layer thickness.

40|$|An {{unsteady}} {{and strong}} vortical propeller wake can have significant interaction {{with a body}} in its race. Since the pod and strut is located downstream an operation propeller for a tractor-type podded propeller, it faces risks of earlier cavitation on the strut, severe vibration of the pod unit, and noise of the propulsor. The aim of this work {{is to develop a}} prediction method for the pressure fluctuation {{on the surface of the}} pod and strut. [...] The study consists of two parts, experimental and numerical. In the experimental study, a podded propeller was tested in a cavitation tunnel. The tip-vortex interacting with the strut was visually investigated, and the <b>strut</b> surface <b>pressure</b> and the propeller shaft loads were measured. By using a data processing procedure, the load and pressure measurements were broken down into time-averaged and phase-averaged components. These components were then linked to the steady and dynamic performance of the propulsor. Pressure measurements showed that the low time-averaged pressure was concentrated in the area around the leading edge of the <b>strut.</b> The lowest <b>pressure</b> was located on the strut suction side near the junction of the strut and pod. However, the largest amplitude of the phase-averaged pressure occurred on the strut leading edge where the tip-vortex impacts the strut. Based on measurement of the propeller shaft loads, the wake impingement effect on the propeller performance was evaluated. The evaluation was made by comparing the shaft loads measured in two tests with and without the installation of the pod and the strut. These showed that wake impingement had no significant effect on the propeller shaft loads, neither on the steady component nor the dynamic components. [...] In the numerical study, a Wake Impingement Model (WIM) was developed and inserted into a panel code, PROPELLA. Simulations of the pressure variation on the strut surface were then conducted using the software. The WIM starts from the relaxed and aligned propeller wake. The motion of the wake sheet was traced step by step. For each time step, every wake panel moved from its previous location to a new position. The new position was determined by the product of the time interval and the local induced velocity. When the wake approached the strut, a scheme was applied to keep the wake from penetrating the body surface. To avoid the large numerical disturbance resulting when two dipole panels get too close, the two dipole panels were merged before the calculation of influence coefficients. Numerical simulations on the same tractor-type podded propeller as that in the experimental study were conducted. Although the amplitude of the pressure fluctuation in the tip-vortex/strut interaction zone was under-predicted, comparisons of the numerical results with the experimental data indicated that the simulated pressure was in good agreement over most of the impingement area. Both experimental and numerical studies with the WIM show that WI has insignificant (around 2 %) effects on the propeller thrust and torque...|$|R
40|$|The {{rigidity}} {{increase of}} structures consisting of plates and shells is a relevant task. One way to obtain plates with enhanced stiffness performance is the corrugation, i. e. change of its topography elevation. Depending on the method, corrugation provides a plate with additional rigidity {{in one or}} several directions without weight gain. The most common way to get corrugated plates is pressure forming. The problem of finding the most energy saving method is very relevant. In this regard, a possible approach is to use buckling of thin cylinder. The idea of this technique {{comes from the fact}} that as a result of stability loss of cylindrical shell in compression along its elements, the cylinder walls are deformed periodically. The article considers the problem of corrugated plates manufacturing using smooth sheet metal. The method of manufacture is based on irreversible process of cylindrical buckling of a shell previously obtained from a worksheet. Such a deformation process may be useful if the energy spent on its implementation is smaller than the energy in standard process of forming. The task of defining the stiffness of a corrugated plate is quite difficult because it is difficult to experimentally measure the tension, bending and coupled stiffness. The numerical simulation of three ways to manufacture corrugated cylindrical shell made of smooth sheet by elastic-plastic deformation process are offered: the first way is to deform the cylindrical shell under the action of axial load on the butt end, and the second way is the influence of <b>strutting</b> internal <b>pressure.</b> In the third way the cylindrical shell is made of the leaf using the special techniques. In order to compare the effectiveness of the options presented for each case the internal energy is calculated. It is shown that the energy expenditure in buckling method is the smallest...|$|R
40|$|To {{fine tune}} the {{aerodynamic}} properties of road going vehicles the flow along the underbody is of outmost importance. Hence moving ground facilities has been introduced. In full-width mono-belt facilities the test vehicle {{is most often}} suspended over the ground plane by a sting system. To mount the wheels, two possibilities exist. The designer of the wind tunnel model is faced with the choice to have the wheels on or off the model. The first option gives the most satisfying boundary conditions from a fluid dynamics point of view, however, the designer will face the problem of creating a frictionless chassis suspension system for the model. The ”wheels off” type does not require such complex system but unfortunately creates a non-realistic flow due {{to the presence of}} so called wheel struts that carries the wheels. In the present work a numerical study of the flow around a ”wheels off” model has been conducted. The study was performed to quantify how the presence of the wheel struts would affect the flow field and hence how this influence flow related measurements made on the model. The work has been done using a commercial CFD-code, running a standard k-epsilon model on a tet-dominated mesh, counting roughly 6. 5 million cells. As expected the flow field {{in the vicinity of the}} wheels is affected due to the extra vorticity introduced by the <b>struts.</b> The modified <b>pressure</b> field alters the drag and of further significance is the influence from the wheel struts on the underbody flow field.

40|$|Scramjets are {{expected}} to {{be an integral part of}} future launch vehicles designed to be reliable, efficient alternatives to current all-rocket powered launchers. An access-to-space scramjet vehicle must operate over a wide range of Mach numbers, including in the hypervelocity regime i. e. Mach numbers in excess of 10. As flight speed increases, it becomes more difficult for scramjet engines to produce sufficient thrust to overcome the vehicle drag. There are two primary reasons for this. First, increasing flight speed leads to an increase in the length required to achieve adequate fuel/air mixing. Also, at high Mach numbers the specific kinetic energy of the captured air is comparable to or greater than the chemical energy released from the combustion of hydrogen fuel. Therefore, it is especially necessary to efficiently convert chemical energy to thrust at hypervelocity conditions. Oxygen enrichment is a thrust augmentation technique proposed for use in scramjet engines to increase the net thrust of a scramjet vehicle at hypervelocity conditions, where oxygen enrichment involves the premixing of oxygen with fuel prior to injection into the engine. This technique addresses the mixing length problems encountered at hypervelocity by providing a head start to the mixing process. In addition, the combustion of fuel at greater than stoichiometric proportions is possible. This work investigates the ways in which oxygen enrichment affects scramjet engine performance at hypervelocity conditions. A set of exploratory experiments was conducted in the T 4 Stalker tube at The University of Queensland at two altitude conditions and with varying levels of fuel/oxygen injection. The standard altitude condition represents flight at a Mach number of 12. 3 and a dynamic pressure of 40. 2 kPa. The high altitude condition represents flight at a Mach number of 11. 4 and a dynamic pressure of 9. 8 kPa. The experiments were conducted in a geometrically simple, rectangular combustor, which is followed by a short thrust nozzle. A 2 D intake compresses the test flow to the desired conditions at the entrance of the combustor. The tests are thus of a semi-direct-connect nature. The combustor inflow is at a Mach number of 3. 8 and a total enthalpy of ~ 7. 5 MJ/kg for both altitude conditions. This corresponds approximately to the expected combustor entry conditions of a representative engine operating at the equivalent flight conditions. Fuel/oxygen are injected from a slot in the base of a centrally mounted fuel injector <b>strut.</b> Wall static <b>pressures</b> are measured along the combustor and in the short thrust nozzle. A quasi-one-dimensional cycle analysis tool is used to model the combustor flow and provide estimates of combustion efficiency. The results with fuel injection without enrichment reveal that combustion at the standard altitude case is limited by the amount of mixing which can occur, whereas combustion at the high altitude case is limited by the rate of chemical reactions. However, at both conditions, ignition is limited by the rate of mixing. Approximately half the fuel is able to adequately mix and burn at the standard altitude condition. The same amount is able to mix at the high altitude condition, but at most 25 % is able to burn due to the reaction limited nature of the flow. Fuel injection with oxygen enrichment has several notable effects. For one, ignition length is reduced by an amount approximately proportional to the level of enrichment. When enough oxidiser to burn 15 % of the fuel is premixed, the ignition length is reduced to ~ 60 % of that with no enrichment. For mixing limited conditions the combustion efficiency is also increased by an amount roughly equal to the level of enrichment. Specific thrust increases with enrichment, however, specific impulse generally decreases. At the standard altitude condition the greatest impacts of enrichment are seen immediately upon ignition and in the first half of the duct. Shortening the combustor improves the performance of enriched scramjets at the standard altitude condition. At the high altitude condition oxygen enrichment mitigates the effects of slow chemical reaction rates allowing, at best, a near doubling of combustion efficiency...|$|R
