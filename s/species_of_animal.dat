5|$|A {{habitat is}} an {{ecological}} or environmental {{area that is}} inhabited by a particular <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal,</b> plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is the natural environment in which an organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population.|$|E
5|$|He {{argues that}} across the world, cannibals {{are viewed as}} {{non-human}} entities, committing acts that no human would ordinarily perpetrate. In this way they were akin to various non-human <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal,</b> and Arens notes that in some societies, cannibals are believed to physically transform into different species in order to kill and consume humans.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> {{are kept}} as pets, {{the most popular}} being mammals, {{especially}} dogs and cats. Plants are grown for pleasure in gardens and greenhouses, yielding flowers, shade, and decorative foliage; some, such as cactuses, able to tolerate dry conditions, are grown as houseplants.|$|E
50|$|The area {{serves as}} home to {{numerous}} <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> ranging from harmless insects to venomous snakes to large animals used in agriculture.

5|$|Several <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> can {{integrate}} cues {{of different}} types to orient themselves and navigate effectively. Insects and birds are able to combine learned landmarks with sensed direction (from the earth's magnetic field or from the sky) to identify {{where they are and}} so to navigate. Internal 'maps' are often formed using vision, but other senses including olfaction and echolocation may also be used.|$|E
5|$|The {{second half}} of the 20th century was the golden age of virus {{discovery}} and most of the over 2,000 recognised <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal,</b> plant, and bacterial viruses were discovered during these years. In 1957, equine arterivirus and the cause of Bovine virus diarrhoea (a pestivirus) were discovered. In 1963, the hepatitis B virus was discovered by Baruch Blumberg, and in 1965, Howard Temin described the first retrovirus. Reverse transcriptase, the enzyme that retroviruses use to make DNA copies of their RNA, was first described in 1970, independently by Howard Martin Temin and David Baltimore. In 1983 Luc Montagnier's team at the Pasteur Institute in France, first isolated the retrovirus now called HIV. In 1989 Michael Houghton's team at Chiron Corporation discovered Hepatitis C.|$|E
5|$|Putnam himself {{may be his}} own most {{formidable}} philosophical adversary. His frequent changes of mind have led him to attack his previous positions. However, many significant criticisms of his views have come from other philosophers and scientists. For example, multiple realizability has been criticized on the grounds that, if it were true, research and experimentation in the neurosciences would be impossible. According to William Bechtel and Jennifer Mundale, {{to be able to}} conduct such research in the neurosciences, universal consistencies must either exist or be assumed to exist in brain structures. It is the similarity (or homology) of brain structures that allows us to generalize across species. If multiple realizability were an empirical fact, results from experiments conducted on one <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> (or one organism) would not be meaningful when generalized to explain the behavior of another species (or organism of the same species). Other criticisms of metaphysical realism have been proposed by Jaegwon Kim, David Lewis, Robert Richardson and Patricia Churchland.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the major}} cases of {{poaching}} is for bushmeat, or meat consumed from non-domesticated <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> from all sorts of classes such as mammals or birds. Usually, bushmeat is considered a subset of poaching due to the hunting <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> regardless <b>of</b> the laws that conserve certain <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals.</b> Poachers hunt for bushmeat for both consumption and for profit.|$|R

25|$|Wild {{animals are}} often kept as pets. The term wild {{in this context}} {{specifically}} applies to any <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> which has not undergone {{a fundamental change in}} behavior to facilitate a close co-existence with humans. Some species listed here may have been bred in captivity for a considerable length of time, but are still not recognized as domesticated.|$|E
25|$|The Flood {{could explain}} extinctions of species at that date, on the {{hypothesis}} that the Ark had not contained all <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal.</b> A Flood that was not universal, on the other hand, had implications for the biblical theory of races and Noah's sons. The theory of catastrophism, which was as much secular as theological in attitude, could be used in analogous ways.|$|E

25|$|Because of the Oregon Coast's {{physical}} complexity, {{many different}} species {{of plant and animal}} {{can be found in the}} region, both terrestrial and marine in nature. However, past human interaction has caused a decline in several <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> along the coast, such as the sea otter. Strict regulations as well as modern human aid has seen a return of some species in recent years.|$|E

25|$|At least 100,000 <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal,</b> and {{possibly}} {{as many as}} 200,000, act as pollinators of the estimated 250,000 species of flowering plants in the world.

Besides birds and bats which are the most frequent visitors, these include monkeys, lemurs, squirrels, rodents and possums.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} Cuvier {{presented}} his 1796 paper on living and fossil elephants, {{it was still}} widely believed that no <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> had ever become extinct.

25|$|Echinostoma {{species have}} low {{specificity}} for their definitive hosts, and can infect {{a variety of}} different <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal,</b> including amphibians, aquatic birds, mammals and humans. A definitive host which is infected with Echinostoma will shed unembryonated Echinostoma eggs in their faeces. When the eggs are in contact with fresh water they may become embryonated, and will then hatch and release miracidia. The miracidia stage of Echinostoma is free-swimming, and actively penetrates the first intermediate snail host, which then becomes infected.|$|E
25|$|Orang Pendek's {{reported}} {{physical characteristics}} differentiate it {{from any other}} <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> known to inhabit the area. All witnesses describe it as an ape- or human-like animal. Its bipedality, fur coloring, and southerly location on the island make orangutans an unlikely explanation, and its bipedality, size, and other physical characteristics make gibbons, the only apes known to inhabit the area, unlikely as well. Many therefore propose that Orang Pendek could represent a new genus of primate or a new species or subspecies of orangutan or gibbon.|$|E
25|$|Like many forested {{regions of}} the western United States and Canada, many large <b>species</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> {{can be found in}} the woods of the region.

All four species, though common now, were {{uncommon}} in the past, having moved more heavily into the region with the beginning of timber harvest. Likewise, smaller species, including nutrias and opossum can also be found, as well as the Townsend's mole, which inhabits many lowland and floodplain areas.|$|E
