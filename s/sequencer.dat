5|$|Industrial metal is {{the fusion}} of heavy metal music and {{industrial}} music, typically employing repeating metal guitar riffs, sampling, synthesizer or <b>sequencer</b> lines, and distorted vocals. Founding industrial metal acts include Ministry, Godflesh, KMFDM, and Rammstein.|$|E
5|$|Along with manual exercises, several {{prominent}} automation companies attended the course. Biosearch of Novato, CA, Genetic Design of Watertown, MA, {{were two of}} several companies to demonstrate automated synthesizers at the course. Biosearch presented their new SAM I synthesizer. The Genetic Design had developed their synthesizer from the design of its sister companies (Sequemat) solid phase peptide <b>sequencer.</b> The Genetic Design arranged with Dr Christian Birr (Max-Planck-Institute for Medical Research) {{a week before the}} event to convert his solid phase <b>sequencer</b> into the semi-automated synthesizer. The team led by Dr Alex Bonner and Rick Neves converted the unit and transported it to Darmstadt for the event and installed into the Biochemistry lab at the Technische Hochschule. As the system was semi-automatic, the user injected the next base {{to be added to the}} growing sequence during each cycle. The system worked well and produced a series of test tubes filled with bright red trityl color indicating complete coupling at each step. This system was later fully automated by inclusion of an auto injector and was designated the Model 25A.|$|E
5|$|Arulpragasam's early {{compositions}} {{relied heavily}} on the Roland MC-505 music <b>sequencer</b> and drum machine. Her later work marked an evolution in her sound with rare instruments, electronics and unusual sound samples. Critics have acclaimed a distinctive style to her music. Lyrically incorporating a range of political, social, philosophical and cultural references that have defied existing pop music conventions, Arulpragasam {{was one of the}} first acts to come to public attention through the internet. She posted many of her songs and videos from 2002 onwards on platforms such as MySpace.|$|E
50|$|As the {{technology}} matured, <b>sequencers</b> gained more features, {{such as the}} ability to record multitrack audio. <b>Sequencers</b> used for audio recording are called digital audio workstations (or DAWs).|$|R
50|$|More recently, a third {{generation}} of DNA <b>sequencers</b> was introduced. The sequencing methods applied by these <b>sequencers</b> {{do not require}} DNA amplification (polymerase chain reaction - PCR), which speeds up the sample preparation before sequencing and reduces errors. In addition, sequencing data is collected from the reactions caused {{by the addition of}} nucleotides in the complementary strand in real time. Two companies introduced different approaches in their third-generation <b>sequencers.</b> Pacific Biosciences <b>sequencers</b> utilize a method called Single-molecule real-time (SMRT), where sequencing data is produced by light (captured by a camera) emitted when a nucleotide is added to the complementary strand by enzymes containing fluorescent dyes. Oxford Nanopore Technologies is another company developing third-generation <b>sequencers</b> data using electronic systems based on nanopore sensing technologies.|$|R
50|$|The MC-8 was {{the first}} in the Microcomposer family of <b>sequencers,</b> {{including}} the Roland MC-4 Microcomposer and Roland MC-202. The Roland MC-8 {{had a significant impact on}} electronic music, with the MC-8 and its descendants having more of an impact on electronic music production in the 1970s and 1980s than any other family of <b>sequencers.</b> CV/Gate <b>sequencers</b> such as the MC-8 and MC-4 were eventually succeeded by MIDI <b>sequencers</b> in the 1980s. The Microcomposer series continued with grooveboxes, including the Roland MC-202 (1983), MC-303 (1996), MC-505 (1998), MC-09 (1999), MC-307 (1999), MC-909 (2002) and MC-808 (2006).|$|R
5|$|FreeStyleGames {{teamed up}} with London based music {{production}} company Crossfade Cartel owned by Ofei Sakyi and Dan Neil to ensure {{the overall quality of}} the soundtrack. The 16 man music production team used a combination of MIDI software along with the music <b>sequencer</b> program, Ableton Live; the MIDI information was used to construct the gameplay elements such as crossfading and scratching with additional custom export software. Because of this nature, Neil stated that it was much easier to alter a mix to meet certain gameplay goals, taking only a few minutes to complete, compared with the development of songs for Guitar Hero.|$|E
5|$|The 808 was {{followed}} in 1983 by the TR-909, the first Roland drum machine to use samples (for its cymbal and hi-hat sounds) alongside analog sounds. In the 1990s, Roland included {{samples of the}} 808 in its successful Groovebox devices. In February 2014, Roland announced the TR-8 drum machine, which recreates the 808 and 909 {{through a combination of}} modeling and sampling. In August 2017, Roland announced the TR-08, a miniaturized 808 reissue with features including an LED display, MIDI and USB connections, expanded <b>sequencer</b> control, and a built-in speaker.|$|E
5|$|Tenebraes {{score is}} very {{different}} to those the band had produced for Argento previously. The early 1980s had seen Simonetti experimenting with dance music, and he decided on a more electronic sound for Tenebrae. Simonetti described the score as an electronica/rock hybrid, with the main theme including disco elements. So {{it would not be}} difficult to accommodate Argento's preference for long takes, Simonetti, Pignatelli and Morante made sure to play each song for 3â€“4 minutes. Recording the score, Simonetti used the Roland Jupiter-8, Roland Vocoder Plus and Minimoog synthesizers, as well as a piano, electric piano, the Oberheim DMX digital drum, a Roland TR-808 drum machine, and Roland MC-4 music <b>sequencer.</b> Pignatelli played bass and fretless guitar, while Morante played electric and acoustic guitar.|$|E
50|$|In 1987, {{software}} <b>sequencers</b> called trackers were developed. They {{became popular}} in the 1980s and 1990s as simple <b>sequencers</b> for creating computer game music, and remain {{popular in the}} demoscene and chiptune music.|$|R
50|$|Akai also {{produced}} several Digital MIDI <b>sequencers</b> and digital synthesizers {{such as the}} MPC range (Music Production Center), a line of integrated drum machines, MIDI <b>sequencers,</b> samplers and direct-to-disk recorders that resemble drum machines.|$|R
50|$|There are commercially {{available}} EL wire <b>sequencers</b> capable of lighting three, four, five, or ten lengths of EL wire. There are professional and experimental <b>sequencers</b> with {{many more than}} ten channels, but for most applications, ten channels is enough. <b>Sequencers</b> usually have options for changing the speed, reversing, changing {{the order of the}} sequence, and sometimes, to change whether the first wires remain lit or go off {{as the rest of the}} wires in the sequence are lit. EL wire <b>sequencers</b> tend to be smaller than a pack of cigarettes and most are powered by batteries. This versatility lends to the sequencers' use at nighttime events where mains electricity is not available.|$|R
5|$|Arkham Origins {{is an open}} world action-adventure game {{incorporating}} stealth game tactics. Batman can use his cape {{to glide}} around Gotham City and the grapnel gun's retracting rope to attach to hard-to-reach ledges and extend his flight. Some gadgets from previous Arkham games are present {{at the start of}} Arkham Origins, while others become available during play. Returning gadgets include the Cryptographic <b>Sequencer,</b> used to hack security consoles; the Batclaw, used for hooking onto surfaces; the Batarang, a throwing weapon; the Remote Batarang, its remote-controlled counterpart; Explosive Gel, used to destroy weak surfaces and knock down enemies; Smoke Pellets, used for stealthy exits and entrances; the Disruptor, which can remotely disable guns and explosive mines, and the Grapnel Accelerator, an earlier version of the Grapnel Boost. New equipment in Batman's arsenal include the Remote Claw; this allows Batman to target two objects and pull them together, allowing him to throw enemies into each other or hit them with objects (tethering two walled points creates a tightrope for Batman to cross); Shock Gloves, which allow Batman to block electric attacks, disable some enemies and stun shielded ones, and short-circuit objects, and the Concussion Detonator, capable of stunning large enemy groups.|$|E

25|$|The {{story of}} The Dream <b>Sequencer</b> {{continues}} the plot found in The Final Experiment, {{starting in the}} year 2084, when the final world war wiped out all life on Earth. During {{the final years of}} fighting on Earth, a number of humans escaped to live on Mars. These people brought supplies with them, but with Earth ravaged, {{there was no way to}} replenish their resources, and soon almost all humans perished. The Dream <b>Sequencer</b> tells the story of the last human being alive, living alone on the Martian colony.|$|E
25|$|Many {{locomotives}} manufactured {{during the}} 1990s {{made use of}} pushbutton controls. In addition, several North American locomotives incorporated a <b>sequencer</b> pedal built into the cab floor beneath the operators position; that when depressed, sounded the grade crossing sequence.|$|E
25|$|Commercialized as the Model 470A protein <b>sequencer,</b> {{it allowed}} {{scientists}} to determine partial amino acid sequences of proteins {{that had not}} previously been accessible, characterizing new proteins and better understanding their activity, function, and effects in therapeutics.

25|$|In the mid-to-late 1980s, Gerhard Lengeling and Chris Adam {{developed}} a MIDI <b>sequencer</b> {{program for the}} Atari ST platform called Creator. When musical notation capabilities were added, this became Notator, and later Notator SL. For simplicity these three are collectively referred to as Notator.|$|E
25|$|The {{two major}} direct methods of protein {{sequencing}} are mass spectrometry and Edman degradation using a protein sequenator (<b>sequencer).</b> Mass spectrometry methods {{are now the}} most widely used for protein sequencing and identification but Edman degradation remains a valuable tool for characterizing a protein's N-terminus.|$|E
25|$|There are percussion-specific sound modules {{that can}} be {{triggered}} by pickups, trigger pads, or through MIDI. These are called drum modules; the Alesis D4 and Roland TD-8 are popular examples. Unless such a sound module also features a <b>sequencer,</b> it is, strictly speaking, not a drum machine.|$|E
50|$|Since the 1980s, {{personal}} computers developed {{and became the}} ideal system for utilizing the vast potential of MIDI. This has created a large consumer market for software such as MIDI-equipped electronic keyboards, MIDI <b>sequencers</b> and Digital Audio Workstations. With universal MIDI protocols, electronic keyboards, <b>sequencers,</b> and drum machines can all be connected together.|$|R
