In 2015, the Serbian Ministry of Defence and Belgrade's Military Museum acquired the ship with the intent of restoring her.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} project became controversial as environmental protection non-governmental organizations (NGOs) drew public {{attention to a}} possible threat that may arise to seven species of bats. Subsequently, the NGOs alleged that the project is illegal, environmentally unsafe, financially not feasible, and technically questionable. Project legality was disputed because {{it is based on}} a 1999 environmental impact assessment (EIA), while Croatian legislation requires that EIAs must not be more than two years old. Flooding of Vilina Cave is cited as an environmental concern, while the financial issues are based on previous cost overruns by Hrvatska elektroprivreda—the <b>state-owned</b> <b>company</b> planning the development—in other projects. One objection to the technical aspects of the project is the possibility that the groundwater may trigger earthquakes. Opponents of the project have urged the Prime Minister of Croatia to cancel development of the plant.|$|E

25|$|As of 2007, {{the total}} cost of Porto Metro mass transit public {{transport}} system stands on 3,500 million euros - over 1% of Portugal's GDP. The first phase of the project alone, which was led by the mayors of several Grande Porto (Greater Porto) municipalities including Valentim Loureiro as a chairman of the <b>state-owned</b> <b>company,</b> was 140% more expensive than initially planned which means a slippage of over 1,500 million euros.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the prior literature revealed few studies on the capital budgeting practices of <b>state-owned</b> <b>companies</b> (SOCs). The goal {{of this study was}} therefore to investigate the capital budgeting techniques employed by decision-makers in South African <b>state-owned</b> <b>companies.</b> The results indicated that the NPV and IRR techniques were used by 43 % of respondents (the NPV was slightly more popular). WACC emerged as the preferred discount rate for capital budgeting purposes. In considering project risk, <b>state-owned</b> <b>companies</b> seem to prefer sensitivity analysis. It is thus recommended that academics emphasise the importance of NPV as a primary capital budgeting technique. [URL]...|$|R
