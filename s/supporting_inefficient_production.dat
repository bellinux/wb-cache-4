Progressive adrenal hyperplasia due to persistent elevation of ACTH results in extreme overproduction of 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) by mid-childhood.

With market forms other than perfect competition, such as monopoly, productive inefficiency can persist, because {{the lack of}} competition {{makes it possible to}} use <b>inefficient</b> <b>production</b> techniques and still stay in business. In addition to monopoly, sociologists have identified a number of ways in which markets may be organizationally embedded, and thus may depart in behavior from economic theory.|$|R

If the firm anticipates that its choice of capital stock will influence the price set by the regulator, <b>inefficient</b> <b>production</b> many result. An empirical study of 48 electric utilities in 1970 suggests that undercapitalization may be present and that regulators set price below that which unregulated firms would set given their chosen capital stock. ...|$|R

We utilize a nonparametric Malmquist productivity index for relevant cross-country and over time productivity growth, technological change, and technical efficiency change comparisons. We document that productivity growth differences between LAC countries and Western countries can only partially be attributed to human capital differences. We argue that along with <b>inefficient</b> <b>production,</b> differences in civil, political, and economic policies and institutions are promising factors in explaining the long-run economic performance of LAC countries. ...|$|R

For many years, students of regulation have argued that this type of regulation does not provide utilities with any incentive to be efficient in their provision of service. In 1962, Harvey Averch and Leland Johnson provided analytical support for the proposition that such regulation tends to result in <b>inefficient</b> <b>production.</b> Averch and Johnson demonstrate that the firm subject to a regulatory constraint has an incentive to use more capital in production than would be the case if costs were to be minimized...|$|R

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} licensing in a noncooperative R&D game. We ask two questions: What are {{the incentives}} for licensing a production technology {{and what is}} the impact of licensing on the pattern of innovation and the consequent evolution of industry costs and market structure? The gains from trading information through licensing contracts are achieved through the replacement of <b>inefficient</b> <b>production</b> techniques (the ex post incentive) and the elimination of inefficient research expenditures (the ex ante incentive). In a duopoly the availability of licensing encourages research when the firms' initial production technologies are close in costs and discourages research when initial costs are asymmetric. ...|$|R

40|$|Conventional {{economic}} theory predicts that medical insurance coverage causes an <b>inefficient</b> <b>production</b> of health because of "ex ante" and "ex post" moral hazard effects. However, no research has empirically examined {{the magnitude of}} the inefficiency. This study empirically examines the impact of medical insurance on the technical efficiency of health production at the metropolitan level. The underlying health production function allows for preventive care, curative care, and behavioral factors. Data envelopment analysis determines relative technical efficiency. The multiple regression results indicate that insurance coverage generates inefficiency but the efficiency loss appears to be relatively small on the extensive margin.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} managerial pay on the Post Keynesian model of growth and distribution. Introducing managerial pay explains why economies may exhibit both wage- and profit-led characteristics in response to changed income distribution. Second, managerial pay undoes Pasinetti's (1961 / 2) theorem regarding the irrelevance of worker saving behavior for long run growth outcomes. Third, managerial pay links neo-classical Marxist theory with Post Keynesian growth theory. Neo-classical Marxists focus on why firms may choose <b>inefficient</b> <b>production</b> techniques. Similar logic carries over to Post Keynesian growth theory and firms may choose techniques that lower growth because they increase profits.

40|$|This model {{analyses}} {{the interaction}} between inflation and the long-run levels of employment and output growth in a Schumpeterian growth model with quality improving innovations under nominal price rigidity. At the unique REE steady state equilibrium, both employment and growth are hump-shaped functions of money growth peaking at positive inflation rates. This is due to four effects of money growth under rigidity: Erosion of its relative price through inflation and the optimal initial mark-up set in anticipation of this influence a firm’s profits. Dispersion in relative prices causes <b>inefficient</b> <b>production</b> while {{the change in the}} average mark-up influences aggregate demand.

Bayesian random stochastic frontier model is used to account for <b>inefficient</b> <b>production</b> and heterogeneity across universities.

This paper evaluates why Latin America has not replicated Western economic success. We find that this failure is primarily due to TFP differences. Latin America’s TFP gap is not plausibly accounted for by human capital differences, but rather reflects <b>inefficient</b> <b>production.</b> We argue that competitive barriers are a promising channel for understanding low Latin TFP. We document that Latin America has many more international and domestic competitive barriers than do Western and successful East Asian countries. We also document a number of microeconomic cases in Latin America in which large reductions in competitive barriers increase productivity to Western levels...|$|R
40|$|Rural {{credit market}} imperfections, {{deriving}} from the informational asymmetries and costly monitoring, {{have been identified}} as one of the key factors to affect the productivity and economic growth in developing countries. The previous literature has extensively studied the impacts of credit constraints on rural pro-ductive behaviour. Foltz (2004) and Petrick (2004) both find that the subsidized credit programs significantly smooth rural investment. Other studies demonstrate that the production outputs are significantly lower for the credit constrained households (Carter 1989; Guirking and Boucher 2008; Briggeman et al. 2009).

This paper empirically examines the value of having local programming on DBS in those markets {{in which it is}} available.

40|$|In Russia, {{compliance}} with {{the rules and regulations}} that govern almost all aspects of economic life has created an extremely hostile environment for microenterprises. More serious than the regulations per se, however, is the potential niche they create for opportunistic behavior by the regulatory authorities. In Russia, the regulatory state has created a corrupt cadre of government bureaucrats who frequently engage in rent-seeking behavior while enforcing regulations. Firms are not uniformly impacted by corruption, however. This paper shows empirical evidence of differential incidence of extortion, based on certain firm and entrepreneurial characteristics. Corruption in Russia is similar to a regressive tax, and acts as a disincentive to innovation and growth, it may induce technologically <b>inefficient</b> <b>production</b> decisions, and can dilute economies of scale and scope...|$|R

This paper analyzes such rivalry {{with a focus on}} some specific features of these markets. While inviting foreign multinationals is always beneficial for local consumers, cost reduction at the local producers (i. e., former SOE's) is necessary to realize the full-fledged benefits of such entry. <b>Inefficient</b> <b>production</b> by the former SOE's is particularly detrimental when the cost difference vis-à-vis foreign entrants is above a threshold level, because the more efficient entrants exploit their cost advantages to raise prices instead of pricing aggressively for market share.
