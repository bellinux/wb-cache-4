25|$|In {{the seniors}} singles {{competition}} Scot Andy Murray {{made the most}} significant impact, becoming the first Brit since Tim Henman in 2004 to reach the quarterfinals. Murray, often castigated in the British media for his surly manner, won the crowd's affections with his five-set victory over Richard Gasquet (for further details on this match, <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>Day</b> 7 summary). In the UK, the Murray-Gasquet match was watched by over 10m people, and in his native Scotland more than 50% of the potential viewing public watched the match. Chris Eaton from Surrey, the ATP No. 661, began his campaign in qualifying, succeeded in doing so, and then beat ATP No. 114 Boris Pašanski, causing a huge surprise. No British women made it beyond the second round, although Anne Keothavong was the first British woman to directly qualify to the main draw since 1998.|$|E
500|$|The episode centres on the {{marriage}} of Torchwood employee Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) to her long-term partner Rhys Williams (Kai Owen). The wedding is complicated by Gwen's sudden impregnation by an alien, though she resolves to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> through. When the nuptials are interrupted by an attack from the biological mother of the alien fetus (played successively by Collette Brown, Nerys Hughes and John Barrowman), [...] Rhys and Gwen's Torchwood colleagues must neutralise the threat. Gwen and Rhys ultimately marry, and the wedding guests have their memories wiped.|$|E
500|$|One of Mayor Feinstein's first actions upon {{being elected}} was to {{announce}} the appointment of Cornelius Murphy as the new Chief of Police. Murphy declared that police cars {{would no longer be}} colored powder blue, but instead would be repainted as [...] "macho black-and-whites." [...] This pleased the rank and file, and restored confidence in police leadership. [...] Murphy also vowed to maintain the progressive policy towards gays that his predecessor had implemented. By 1980, one in seven new police recruits was either gay or lesbian. In one of his last public appearances, outgoing Police Chief Charles Gain stated that he fully expected to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> when San Francisco would have both a gay mayor and Chief of Police. By October 1985, an organization for gay law enforcement personnel in California, the Golden State Peace Officers Association, had incorporated as a non-profit organization. It was founded by Art Roth, an Oakland police officer who was present {{on the night of the}} riots.|$|E

500|$|Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic {{gave the}} episode a 4.6 out of 5 stars, {{and went on}} to {{describe}} the episode as [...] "A funny, touching, entertaining Glee episode that didn't feature a single line from Sue Sylvester? I never thought I'd <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> But that's exactly what transpired on 'Silly Love Songs', as the show stopped feeling like a Public Service Announcement for a week and actually focused on well-paced, well-written relationship developments among its core characters." [...] Joel Keller of TV Squad gave the episode a positive review, and wrote, Silly Love Songs' strikes an interesting contrast to Sunday night's post-Super Bowl episode in that tonight was more about the kids and where they are in their stories than about big production numbers and Sue's cartoon evilness. It was also the funniest episode of the season, in no small part because we got some insight into the lives of two New Directions members we rarely get to hang out with for any length of time: Santana and Lauren." [...] James Poniewozik of Time Magazine praised the storyline and the musical performances of the episode. However, Soraya Roberts of the Daily News gave the episode a negative review: [...] "This show sometimes sounds like it was written by a PIT, prime idiot TV writer. It's almost as bad as Tina breaking down into tears for no reason while singing 'My Funny Valentine' to Mike and Blaine attempting to channel Frank Sinatra while singing Paul McCartney's 'Silly Love Songs' in the middle of Breadsticks." [...] Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post praised the storyline, calling it cohesive.|$|E
2500|$|Roosevelt's biographer Joseph P.

2500|$|Justinian, in despair, {{considered}} fleeing, but {{his wife}} Theodora {{is said to have}} dissuaded him, saying, [...] "Those who have worn the crown should never survive its loss. Never will I <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> when I am not saluted as empress." [...] Although an escape route across the sea lay open for the emperor, Theodora insisted that she would stay in the city, quoting an ancient saying, [...] "Royalty is a fine burial shroud," [...] or perhaps, [...] " [...] Purple makes a fine winding sheet." ...|$|E

2500|$|As Sydney University's Challis Professor of Philosophy, Anderson was a {{formidable}} {{champion of the}} principle of academic freedom from authoritarian intervention. For example, he fought a successful battle to end the role of the British Medical Association in setting course standards and student quotas in the medical school. He also railed against the presence on campus of a military unit—the Sydney University Regiment—and lived to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> in 1960 when the regiment's campus HQ was destroyed by fire.

2500|$|Falwell {{repeatedly}} denounced certain teachings {{in public}} schools and secular education in general, calling them breeding grounds for atheism, secularism, and humanism, which he claimed to be in contradiction with Christian morality. He advocated that the United States change its public education system by implementing a school voucher system which would allow parents {{to send their children}} to either public or private schools. In his book America Can Be Saved he wrote that [...] "I hope I live to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> when, as in the early days of our country, we won't have any public schools. The churches will have taken them over again and Christians will be running them." ...|$|E

One Louisianan artillery soldier stated, [...] "I never want to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> when a negro is put on an equality with a white person.

Meanwhile, personal revelations contained within the flashforwards occupy the personal lives of the principal characters. Mark Benford sees himself relapsing into alcoholism; his wife sees herself with another man; Demetri Noh sees nothing, which could mean {{that he will not}} be alive to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> everyone else has glimpsed or, perhaps, that his future wasn't set {{on the day of the}} flashforward.

2500|$|A {{few years}} later, Vanessa Williams (Miss New York 1983) won {{the title of}} Miss America 1984 on September 17, 1983, making her the first African American woman to wear the crown.

For the first time in pageant history, a reigning Miss America was the target of death threats and hate mail.
