40|$|Background The {{ketogenic}} diet (KD) is an established, effective non-pharmacologic {{treatment for}} drug resistant childhood epilepsy. For a long time, the KD was {{not recommended for}} use in infancy (under the age of 2 years) because {{this is such a}} crucial period in development and the perceived high risk of nutritional inadequacies. Indeed, infants are a vulnerable population with <b>specific</b> <b>nutritional</b> requirements. But current research shows that the KD is highly effective and well tolerated in infants with epilepsy. Seizure freedom is often achieved and maintained in this specific patient group. There is a need for standardised protocols and management recommendations for clinical use. Method In April 2015, a project group of 5 experts was established {{in order to create a}} consensus statement regarding the clinical management of the KD in infants. The manuscript was reviewed and amended by a larger group of 10 international experts in the KD field. Consensus was reached with regard to guidance on how the diet should be administered and in whom. Results The resulting recommendations include patient selection, pre-KD counseling and evaluation, <b>specific</b> <b>nutritional</b> requirements, preferred initiation, monitoring of adverse effects at initiation and follow-up, evaluation and KD discontinuation.

40|$|The {{majority}} of patients with advanced cancer are recognised by impaired immune competence influenced by several factors, including the type and stage of the tumour {{and the presence of}} cachexia. Recently, a <b>specific</b> <b>nutritional</b> combination containing fish oil, specific oligosaccharide mixture, high protein content and leucine has been developed aimed to support the immune system of cancer patients {{in order to reduce the}} frequency and severity of (infectious) complications. In a recently modified animal model cachexia is induced by inoculation of C 26 tumour cells in mice. In a pre-cachectic state, no effect was observed on contact hypersensitivity, a validated in vivo method to measure Th 1 -mediated immune function, after adding the individual nutritional ingredients to the diet of tumour-bearing mice. However, the complete mixture resulted in significantly improved Th 1 immunity. Moreover, in a cachectic state, the complete mixture reduced plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and beneficially affected ex vivo immune function. Accordingly, the combination of the nutritional ingredients is required to obtain a synergistic effect, leading to a reduced inflammatory state and improved immune competence. From this, it can be concluded that the <b>specific</b> <b>nutritional</b> combination has potential as immune-supporting nutritional intervention to reduce the risk of (infectious) complications in cancer patients...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAge-related {{losses of}} muscle mass, strength, and {{function}} (sarcopenia) pose significant threats to physical performance, independence, {{and quality of}} life. Nutritional supplementation could positively influence aspects of sarcopenia and thereby prevent mobility disability. ObjectiveTo test the hypothesis that a <b>specific</b> oral <b>nutritional</b> supplement can result in improvements in measures of sarcopenia. DesignA multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind, 2 parallel-group trial among 380 sarcopenic primarily independent-living older adults with Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB; 0 – 12) scores between 4 and 9, and a low skeletal muscle mass index. The active group (n =  184) received a vitamin D and leucine-enriched whey protein nutritional supplement to consume twice daily for 13  weeks. The control group (n =  196) received an iso-caloric control product to consume twice daily for 13  weeks. Primary outcomes of handgrip strength and SPPB score, and secondary outcomes of chair-stand test, gait speed, balance score, and appendicular muscle mass (by DXA) were measured at baseline, week 7, and week 13 of the intervention. ResultsHandgrip strength and SPPB improved in both groups without significant between-group differences. The active group improved more in the chair-stand test compared with the control group, between-group effect (95 % confidence interval) : − 1. 01  seconds (− 1. 77 to − 0. 19), P = . 018. The active group gained more appendicular muscle mass than the control group, between-group effect: 0. 17  kg (0. 004 – 0. 338), P = . 045. ConclusionsThis 13 -week intervention of a vitamin D and leucine-enriched whey protein oral nutritional supplement resulted in improvements in muscle mass and lower-extremity function among sarcopenic older adults. This study shows proof-of-principle that <b>specific</b> <b>nutritional</b> supplementation alone might benefit geriatric patients, especially relevant {{for those who are}} unable to exercise. These results warrant further investigations into the role of a <b>specific</b> <b>nutritional</b> supplement as part of a multimodal approach to prevent adverse outcomes among older adults at risk for disability...|$|R

40|$|The authors {{evaluate}} the Vaso de Leche (VL) feeding program in Peru. They pose {{the question that}} if a community-based multistage targeting scheme {{such as that of}} the VL program is progressive, {{is it possible that the}} program can achieve its <b>nutritional</b> <b>objectives?</b> The authors address this by linking VL public expenditure data with household survey data to assess the targeting, and then to model the determinants of nutritional outcomes of children to see if VL program interventions have an impact on nutrition. They confirm that the VL program is well targeted to poor households and to those with low nutritional status. While the bulk of the coverage of the poor is attributed to targeting of poor districts, the fact that the poor receive larger in-kind transfers is attributed to intradistrict targeting. But the impactof these food subsidies beyond their value as income transfers is limited by the degree to which the commodity transfers are inframarginal. The authors find that transfers of milk and milk substitutes from the VL program are inframarginal for approximately half of the households that receive them. So, it is not entirely surprising that they fail to find econometric evidence of the <b>nutritional</b> <b>objectives</b> of the VL program being achieved. In models of child standardized heights, the authors find no impact of the VL program expenditures on the nutritional outcomes of young children-the group to whom the program is targeted.
