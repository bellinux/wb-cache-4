This article aims to respond to the following questions: What role do practical recommendations play in research on vocational education dropout? To which specific areas of the educational intervention do these recommendations refer? What specifically are the main practical recommendations for reducing vocational education dropouts? A review of the existing scientific literature has been conducted. A total of 60 documents have been located and analyzed. Results suggests that the main body of recommendations are focused on advising and counseling of students while the recommendations aimed at changing the institutional environment and organization and the teaching <b>staff</b> <b>competences</b> and characteristics are of less concern.|$|E
40|$|This article {{argues that}} the role of the {{lecturer}} in an internationalised higher education institution is not limited to teaching internationally or interculturally diverse groups of students. Teaching staff members will normally be required to undertake a variety of tasks, which require different competences. In addition, they will need specific competences to be able to function well in an international working environment. In order to foster the discussion on the topic of <b>staff</b> <b>competences</b> in relation to internationalisation, this article suggests the use an ‘International Competences Matrix. ’ This HRM tool is meant to alert both teaching staff and their heads of department to the fact that working in an international environment requires new and additional competences and that training teaching staff in ‘weak’ competence areas may be necessary to make a university’s internationalisation policy a success...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{decision}} to merge libraries generates stress, {{it is also a}} great opportunity to start a global reflection on the functioning of libraries. In 2003, the University of Liège decided to create a new physical and functional structure by combining the previously independent libraries of Medicine, Veterinary Medicine, Botany, Zoology, Psychology and Educational Sciences. The initial phase included a plan to remove the collections and standardise the academic teaching of IT literacy in the various disciplines. We now want to question our missions and evaluate our present working procedures in order to optimise our services, eventually develop new ones, and make them visible through a new website or any other types of support. The different populations of users need to be clearly identified, evaluated and anticipated. <b>Staff</b> <b>competences</b> must be evaluated to guarantee that users' expectations are met, and possibly to envisage any new services that may need to be created. In addition, <b>staff</b> <b>competences</b> must be improved through adapted education and tailored professional training. At the same time, the library involvement in academic teaching deserves to be properly highlighted. We are aware that there is not anything new in such an approach, but the pieces of evidence are scattered, outdated or not adapted to our present situation. As a consequence, we propose an overview of the literature concerning the marketing of academic libraries, conducted according to the principles of Evidence-Based Library and Information Practice. We shall select the most important publications providing strong theoretical support, and we shall collect existing tools, evaluation grids and procedure rules that might be useful during any step of the project. We shall organise them into a structured and pragmatic working strategy that could be used by any library interested in a marketing approach. It should integrate the different topics previously mentioned such as the library’s missions, the evaluation and optimisation of services, as well as the visibility of the teaching activities and the professional education programmes developed by academic libraries...|$|E

40|$|Background Low {{competence}} levels among nursing staff {{have been associated}} with lower quality of elderly care. However, interventions aimed at improving nursing <b>staff</b> <b>competence</b> have not always been evaluated for their possible impact on the quality of elderly care. An educational intervention {{in the form of a}} workplace “toolbox” was shown to have positive effects on nursing <b>staff</b> <b>competence</b> and work satisfaction. It was therefore of interest to investigate whether the intervention had any effect on residents’ and/or their family members’ ratings of the quality of elderly care. Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible effects of an educational intervention for nursing staff on care recipients’ and their relatives’ ratings of the quality of elderly care. Design The study was a prospective, non-randomized, controlled intervention. Participants and settings Care recipients and their relatives in two elderly care organisations in Sweden. Methods Practical instruments and educational materials for improving <b>staff</b> <b>competence</b> and work practices were collated in a workplace “toolbox”, which was introduced in the intervention organisation in February of 2003. Care recipients and their relatives’ ratings of the quality of care were measured pre and post-intervention by questionnaire and compared to quality ratings in a reference organisation, where no toolbox was introduced. Results Neither care recipients’ nor relatives’ ratings of the quality of care changed significantly over time in the intervention organisation. Furthermore, there were no significant interaction effects over time between organisations for quality of care ratings. Methodological weaknesses, such as low response rates, may have influenced results. Conclusions The results of this study raise questions regarding the alleged positive association between <b>staff</b> <b>competence</b> and work satisfaction and care recipients’ perceptions of the quality of care...|$|R

40|$|The {{decision}} about curriculum modification usually {{takes place at}} the knowledge level, mainly with consideration of individual academic <b>staff</b> <b>competences</b> and qualifications. However, traditional approaches to cost estimation of curriculum modification are focused on material resources only. In this paper we present a cost estimation method and decision model for curriculum modification in educational organizations. The proposed method works at the knowledge level and employs competence sets as knowledge representation models in educational organizations. Authors used the theory of hierarchical, multilevel systems in order to define the model of the decision-making process of curriculum modification and its dimension. Basing on this and also using a fuzzy competence model the cost estimation algorithm {{in the form of a}} group competences expansion algorithm is proposed. The algorithm focuses on the cost of staff competence expansion caused by the knowledge development process.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence of skill shortages in Australian commerce and industry, as global competition, changes {{in technology and}} in Government regulation place greater demands on company employees. There is, consequently, strong corporate interest in new educational paradigms, such as e-Learning, particularly web-based education, to maintain <b>staff</b> <b>competences</b> in a changing workplace environment. Simultaneously, workplace reform driven by the productivity imperative, and by unfavourable demographic changes in the Western world are increasing employee turnover and individual stress. Training managers, while addressing the corporate demands vigorously, are seriously challenged by the scope and difficulty of re-skilling a mobile and diverse workforce. Considerable difficulty, for example, has been experienced in introducing electronic content into new, or even existing, business training scenarios!

40|$|PurposeDue to the {{demographic}} change morbidity raises {{the demand for}} medical hospital services {{as well as a}} need for medical specialization, while economic and human resources are diminishing. Unlike other industries hospitals do not have sufficient data and adequate models to relate growing demands and increasing performance to growth in staff capacity and to increase in <b>staff</b> <b>competences.</b> MethodBased on huge medical data sample covering the years from 2010 to 2014 with more than 150, 000 operations of the Department for Anesthesiology at the University Hospital Muenster, Germany, comparisons are drawn between the development of medical services and the development of personnel capacity and expertise. ResultsThe numbers of surgical operations increased by 21 % and “skin incision to closure” time by 17 %. Simultaneously, personnel capacity grew by 16 % largely resting upon recruiting first-time employees. Expertise measured as “years of professional experience” dwindled from 10 [*]years to 5. 4 [*]years on average and staff turnover accelerated. ConclusionStatic benchmark data collected at fixed reference dates do not sufficiently reflect the nexus between capacity and competence and do not reflect the dynamic changes in a hospital’s requirements for expertise and specialization, at all. Staff turnover leads to a loss of experience, which jeopardizes patient safety and hampers medical specialization. In consequence of the dramatic shortage of medical specialists, drop-off rates must be reduced and retention rates must be increased. To that end, working conditions need to be fundamentally converted for a multigeneration, multicultural, and increasingly female workforce...|$|E

Kommers (Eds.), Proceedings of IADIS International Conference Web Based Communities 2009 (pp. 27 - 34). Carvoeiro, Algarve, Portugal: IADIS. Social Learning is {{the utilization of}} Social Networks and Social Technology for specific organizational learning outcomes. In the university’s organization contexts these outcomes are, for instance, academic staff professionalization. In this paper we present an initial exploration on how a social learning network to enhance academic <b>staff</b> <b>competences</b> can be designed. The starting point is to explore the use of social networks sites (SNS) in the academic staff and, considering the results, suggest what characteristics a social learning network should have to enhance competence development. A survey on the use and appreciation of SNS was conducted among our university staff. The responses showed that although staff is familiar with SNS, the actual use and participation is much lower. Staff tend to browse and visit special purpose SNS, but register to general and professional SNS. Reasons to join and participate are mostly social: finding and connecting to people. In a social learning network for competence development, a clear aim, next to indicators of quality of participants and learning material was considered important. Motivations to learn include usability, appealing interface, clear expectations and learning support services.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a part of the author`s wider {{research}} that examines the impact of operational risks on the functioning of financial organisations, with particular reference to central banks. The research clearly demonstrates the importance of the human factor in the timely identification and efficient management of operational risks. People are the basic strength of organisations; they are the source of innovation, as well as of good relations with customers and other interested parties. The paper highlights the illusion that people can be successful in improving products or providing better services without improving themselves as well. Any assessment of the impact of the human factor on the appearance, identification, and efficient management of operational risks is a very complex process. This has to be an ongoing process that develops through the development of the organisation, <b>staff</b> <b>competences</b> and motivation, as well as organisational culture. In particular, emphasis must be placed on the importance of learning and knowledge in both the recognition and the efficient management of operational risks. The paper identifies education as the foundation of knowledge and knowledge as the foundation of the long-term development of organisations. They grow in significance when employing a process approach to risk management, especially the connected roles of ?process owners? and ?risk owners? in effective process and risk management. It is also clearly shown that any defence against risk, is as strong as its weakest link, and the weakest link in the chain of defence is an untrained, demotivated or dissatisfied employee or team, who are unable to recognize risk on time...|$|E

40|$|Aim: The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate associations between patients’ satisfaction with different domains of inpatient substance use treatment and their perceived treatment outcome. The primary purpose was to identify domains of treatment satisfaction most strongly associated with a positive treatment outcome. Design: Data were based on a survey among 188 patients with alcohol and/or illicit substance use disorders completing a three–six-month inpatient stay at one of two public clinics in Central Norway. The survey was carried out shortly before discharge. The 15 -item questionnaire covered ratings of staff and programme factors, and services received for medical and mental problems and ancillary services. The outcome score was based on items measuring perceived substance use improvements and benefit of treatment. Results: A significant proportion of patients were dissatisfied with the support provided for housing, financial issues and employment. Confidence in <b>staff</b> <b>competence</b> was the domain of treatment satisfaction most strongly associated with the outcome score. Furthermore, patients were more likely to report a positive outcome when they were actively involved in the treatment, as indicated by satisfaction with opportunities to affect treatment plans.

Seven empirically distinct dimensions of staff behavior relevant to their relationships with parents were identified, including information transmission, clarity and honesty of communication, acceptance of parental efficacy, resolution of conflicts, personal contact with parents, empathy with the child, and <b>staff</b> <b>competence.</b> With respect to their experiences with the treatment of their child, parents also were asked to indicate their satisfaction with the medical staff in terms of changes in their respect and/or anger for the medical staff, changes in feelings about doctors, support received from doctors and nurses, and stress resulting from tense relations with the staff. The seven dimensions of parent-staff relationships were used as predictors in a series of multiple regressions employing these satisfaction measures as criteria. The overall quality of the parent-staff relationship was best predicted by positive personal contact. The strongest predictor of whether or not parents felt increased anger was staff empathy with child. Increased respect for the medical staff was predicted by a combination of information transmission and perception of <b>staff</b> <b>competence.</b> Experience of support by parents was best predicted by information transmission and staff acceptance of parental efficacy in treatment and decision making. This complex pattern supports the usefulness of disaggregating measures of staff behavior and parent satisfaction when examining the relations between medical consumers and service providers...|$|R

40|$|Insufficient <b>competence</b> among nursing <b>staff</b> is a {{major concern}} in elderly care {{worldwide}} as the healthcare needs of the elderly become increasingly complex. In previous research, insufficient competence has been associated with work dissatisfaction and stress among elderly care nurses, and with lower quality of care. This thesis describes the development, implementation and evaluation of an educational intervention for nursing staff in elderly care. In a prospective, controlled study, evaluation of the educational toolbox was based on nursing staff ratings of their competence and psychosocial work environment, as well as on care recipients’ and family relatives’ ratings of the quality of elderly care. Paper I validated a questionnaire measuring care recipient relatives’ perceptions of quality of care. Paper II compared self-rated competence, work strain, stress, and work satisfaction between staff working in home-based care and nursing homes. Papers III and IV evaluated the impact of the educational intervention on staff perceptions of their competence and psychosocial work environment (Paper III) and on care recipients’ and relatives’ perceptions of the quality of care (Paper IV). The results showed that staff ratings of their competence and psychosocial work environment, including work satisfaction and work stress, improved significantly over time in the intervention municipality, compared to the reference group. Neither care recipients’ nor relatives’ ratings of the quality of care changed significantly over time in the intervention organization. Furthermore, there were no significant interaction effects over time between the intervention and reference groups for quality ratings. These results indicate that an educational toolbox that can be used according to local workplace needs may be an effective and sustainable intervention for improving <b>staff</b> <b>competence</b> and the psychosocial work environment. However, further studies are needed to investigate whether, and under what conditions, improved <b>staff</b> <b>competence</b> and work environment have an impact on quality of care...|$|R
