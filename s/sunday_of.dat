5|$|The {{first major}} festivals {{of the year}} are the Dōsan Festival and the Gifu Festival, both of which occur on the first Saturday and {{following}} <b>Sunday</b> <b>of</b> April. Because the Dōsan Festival is a memorial to Saitō Dōsan, many of the festivities take place near Jōzai-ji, where his remains are buried. The Gifu Festival is a Shinto festival that begins at Inaba Shrine and winds its way through other shrines within the city. Both festivals include street vendors, flea markets, and floats paraded through the city. The Gifu Nobunaga Festival, which takes place on the first Saturday and following <b>Sunday</b> <b>of</b> October, also pays homage to a former lord of Gifu. This festival centers on the downtown area and includes a procession of horses and warriors down the city's main streets.|$|E

5|$|The {{period of}} Daylight Saving Time before the longest day is {{shorter than the}} period after, in several {{countries}} including the United States and Europe. This unequal split is an energy saving measure. For example, in the U.S. the period of Daylight Saving Time {{is defined by the}} Energy Policy Act of 2005. The period for Daylight Saving Time was extended by changing the start date from the first <b>Sunday</b> <b>of</b> April to the second <b>Sunday</b> <b>of</b> March, and the end date from the last Sunday in October to the first Sunday in November.|$|E

5|$|Bach {{followed}} a specific structure {{for most of}} the cantatas of his chorale cantata cycle, especially the 40 he presented consecutively from the first Sunday after Trinity of 1724 to Palm <b>Sunday</b> <b>of</b> 1725. In this chorale cantata format he retained the original text and melody of the chorale on which the cantata was based in the outer stanzas, typically treating the first as a chorale fantasia and the last as a four-part chorale setting, while the inner stanzas were reworded by a librettist as the basis for recitatives and arias, usually with music independent of the chorale tune.|$|E

5|$|Bach led {{the first}} {{performance}} of the cantata on 16 June 1715. The performance material for Weimar is lost. Bach performed the work again as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. Extant performance material was prepared by his assistant Johann Christian Köpping. The first possible revival is the Trinity <b>Sunday</b> <b>of</b> Bach's first year in office, 4 June 1724, also the conclusion of his first year and first Leipzig cantata cycle, because he had assumed the office on the first Sunday after Trinity the year before. Bach made presumably minor changes.|$|E
5|$|In the 2000s, {{photographer}} Mark Sadan informally led the Sunday Photo Group, {{which had}} about 24 members and met at All Saints', {{on the second}} <b>Sunday</b> <b>of</b> each month. In late 2006, the church was featured on Nightline and USA Today for hosting U2charists, Eucharists accompanying U2 songs; the church has held two such services. The church estimated that {{of the people to}} attend one of their U2charists, 70 percent were visitors.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Swift, as Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin, {{produced}} many sermons {{during his}} tenure from 1713 to 1745. Although Swift is better known today for his secular writings such as Gulliver's Travels, A Tale of a Tub, or the Drapier's Letters, Swift was known in Dublin for his sermons that were delivered every fifth <b>Sunday.</b> <b>Of</b> these sermons, Swift wrote down 35, of which 12 have been preserved. In his sermons Swift attempted to impart traditional Church of Ireland values to his listeners in a plain manner.|$|E

5|$|On a rainy <b>Sunday</b> <b>of</b> 1951, {{the crowd}} left Les Corts stadium after a 2–1 win against Santander by foot, refusing to catch any trams, and {{surprising}} the Francoist authorities. The reason was simple: {{at the same}} time, a tram strike was taking place in Barcelona, receiving the support of blaugrana fans. Events like this made CF Barcelona represent {{much more than just}} Catalonia and many progressive Spaniards saw the club as a staunch defender of rights and freedoms.|$|E

The first edition in 1934 was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the 1942 event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.|$|E

Half-naked men ring bells, and carry shrines and other devices that shoot off large sparks. Near the end of August, the city sponsors Takigi Noh, a traditional form of Japanese theater that takes place {{on the banks of}} the Nagara River, lit only by the surrounding bonfires and the fires of cormorant boats.|$|E

2500|$|Ember {{days are}} four {{separate}} sets of three days {{within the same}} week — specifically, the Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday — roughly equidistant in the circuit of the year, that were formerly set aside for fasting and prayer. These days set apart for special prayer and fasting were considered especially suitable for the ordination of clergy. The Ember Days are known in Latin as quatuor tempora (the [...] "four seasons"), or jejunia quatuor temporum ("fasts of the four seasons"). They occur in the weeks between {{the third and fourth}} <b>Sundays</b> <b>of</b> Advent, {{between the first and second}} <b>Sundays</b> <b>of</b> Lent, between Pentecost and Trinity Sunday, and beginning the first Wednesday after the Exaltation of the Holy Cross (September 14), which is between the liturgical third and fourth <b>Sundays</b> <b>of</b> September.|$|R
