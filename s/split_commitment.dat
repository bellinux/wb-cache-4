5000|$|Jarvis <b>split</b> <b>commitment</b> to the not-for-profit {{world of}} both rowing and {{diabetes}} ended up costing him big. On {{top of the}} 6-8 hours of training per day, 18 training sessions per week (with growing intensity as Beijing drew near), he also poured his passion into the diabetes community in Canada and tried to remain connected to the US community he had built. Emails came in from {{parents of children with}} diabetes and diabetic athletes from around the world, plus squeezing in over 75 speaking events in 2007 alone - Jarvis was stretched thin. In the peak of the racing season, Jarvis was pulled from a team meeting by the team manager to inform him of a [...] "whereabouts failure". As Jarvis was one of the 5 members of the Olympic rowing team selected for a new focused initiative to track the whereabouts of the worlds top athletes, to insure at any time a spot check on banned substance abuse could be possible, he needed to submit proper documentation to the Canadian Center for Ethics in Sport - a task he neglected to comply with. Jarvis was required to submit daily activities, time and locations 30-120 days in advance to comply with this legislation. This was something that all Canadian elite athletes were required to do. Jarvis was unable to manage his email stream and had missed two emails from the CCES who had faulted him with inadequate information and given 2 warnings.|$|E

40|$|To {{gain insight}} into the timing of twinning, we have {{examined}} a closely related event, X-chromosome inactivation, in female MZ twin pairs. X-inactivation patterns in peripheral blood and buccal mucosa were compared between monochorionic MZ (MC-MZ) and dichorionic MZ (DC-MZ) twins. Overall, the MC-MZ twins displayed highly similar X-inactivation patterns, whereas DC-MZ twins frequently differed in their X-inactivation patterns, when both tissues were tested. Previous experimental data suggest that commitment to X inactivation occurs when there are 10 - 20 cells in the embryo. Simulation of embryo <b>splitting</b> after <b>commitment</b> to X inactivation suggests that MC-MZ twinning occurs three or four rounds of replication after X inactivation, whereas a DC-MZ twinning event occurs earlier, before or {{around the time of}} X inactivation. Finally, the overall degree of skewing in the MZ twins was not significantly different from that observed in singletons. This indicates that X inactivation does not play a direct role in the twinning process, and it further suggests that extreme unequal splitting is not a common mechanism of twin formation. status: publishe...|$|R
