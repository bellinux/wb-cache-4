The {{lack of an}} ATC system on most of Britain's railways was at last seen as an urgent issue. From 1956 the BR-designed Automatic Warning System (AWS) was installed. It was similar to ATC but relied on an induced magnetic field rather than an electric current and featured a visual indicator in the cab. The receiving system was installed on the Coronation class locomotives from 1959 onwards. The outward evidence of on-board AWS comprised a protective shield behind the front <b>screw</b> <b>coupling,</b> a box to house the necessary batteries immediately {{in front of the}} cab on the right-hand side and a cylindrical vacuum reservoir above the right-hand running plate.|$|E

40|$|A shorted waveguide-stub {{coupling}} {{mechanism is}} presented for implementing narrow-band multimode coupled cavity filters without <b>coupling</b> <b>screws.</b> The <b>coupling</b> element is a shorted rectangular waveguide stub {{placed in the}} end walls of cylindrical filter cavities, using perturbation of the magnetic fields to obtain coupling between degenerate modes. This structure is well suited to analysis and design with the efficient and accurate mode-matching method. Coupling coefficients and resonator frequencies can be controlled by varying cavity dimensions and the length, width, and depth of the rectangular coupling element.

40|$|To {{study the}} fluid motion-vehicle {{dynamics}} interaction, {{a model of}} four, liquid filled two-axle container freight wagons was set up. The railway vehicle has been modelled as a multi-body system (MBS). To include fluid sloshing, an equivalent mechanical model has been developed and incorporated. The influence of several factors has been studied in computer simulations, such as track defects, curve negotiation, train velocity, wheel wear, liquid and solid wagonload, and container baffles. SIMPACK {{has been used for}} MBS analysis, and ANSYS for liquid sloshing modelling and equivalent mechanical systems validation. Acceleration and braking manoeuvres of the freight train set the liquid cargo into motion. This longitudinal sloshing motion of the fluid cargo inside the tanks initiated a swinging motion of some components of the coupling gear. The coupling gear consists of UIC standard traction hooks and <b>coupling</b> <b>screws</b> that are located between buffers. One of the <b>coupling</b> <b>screws</b> is placed in the traction hook of the opposite wagon thus joining the two wagons, whereas the unused <b>coupling</b> <b>screw</b> rests on a hanger. Simulation results showed that, for certain combinations of type of liquid, filling level and container dimensions, the liquid cargo could provoke an undesirable, although not hazardous, release of the unused <b>coupling</b> <b>screw</b> from its hanger. The <b>coupling</b> <b>screw's</b> release was especially obtained when a period of acceleration was followed by an abrupt braking manoeuvre at 1 m/s 2. It was shown that a resonance effect between the liquid's oscillation and the <b>coupling</b> <b>screw's</b> rotary motion could be the reason for the <b>coupling</b> <b>screw's</b> undesired release. Possible solutions to avoid the phenomenon are given. Acceleration and braking manoeuvres of the freight train set the liquid cargo into motion.

Cooke and his passengers were drinking and smoking in the van, and Cooke invited passengers to apply the van handbrake. Correct operation of the brake was necessary, not only to slow the train, but also to control the tension in the carriage couplings. There were three separate breakages of couplings ahead of the rear brake van on the outward journey: at Brettell Lane and Hagley both the main screw couplings and side safety chains failed, and at Droitwich it was found that another <b>screw</b> <b>coupling</b> was failed, but its associated side chains had held. Cooke made temporary repairs on all three occasions. To repair the first two breakages, Cooke managed to find spare three-link or screw couplings; but at Droitwich he was only able to patch up the side chains, which were not designed to hold the full weight of a train. On arrival at Worcester, the train was examined by the inspector of rolling stock: the repaired/replaced side chains were replaced by four-link goods couplings before the return journey, but no attempt was made to repair or replace failed centre couplings: these were difficult to access, and the inspector considered that a re-made <b>screw</b> <b>coupling</b> was weaker than the goods couplings (which he considered adequate).|$|E
