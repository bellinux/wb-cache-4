50|$|Throughout the 1960s, 1970s {{and early}} 1980s, Kingsway Trunk <b>Switching</b> <b>Centre</b> (as it became known) was a trunk <b>switching</b> <b>centre</b> and {{repeater}} station with Post Office engineering staff totalling over 200 at its peak. Also located on site was the Radio Interference Investigation Group, whose function was to prevent television viewers and radio listeners in north and central London from suffering interference to their service from external {{sources such as}} thermostats, fluorescent tubes and injection moulding equipment. The country's first Radiopaging terminal was also installed on this site in the 1970s.|$|E

50|$|The Gateway Mobile Location Centre {{contains}} functionality {{required to}} support LBS (Location-based Service). In one PLMN (Public Land Mobile Network), {{there may be}} more than one GMLC. The GMLC is the first node an external LBS client accesses in a GSM, UMTS or LTE network. The GMLC may request routing information from the HLR (Home Location register) or HSS (Home Subscriber Server). After performing registration authorization, it sends positioning requests to either the VMSC (Visited Mobile <b>Switching</b> <b>Centre),</b> SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node) or MSC (Mobile <b>Switching</b> <b>Centre)</b> Server and receives final location estimates from the corresponding entity.|$|E
50|$|One {{business}} that located on Doxford International is mobile phone operator EE Limited, {{which has a}} customer support centre that now employs around 1,000 people. The site operates as a <b>switching</b> <b>centre,</b> underpinning the company's network between Leeds and Edinburgh.|$|E
5000|$|It {{originally}} formed one of {{a network}} of 18 Zone <b>Switching</b> <b>Centres</b> within the United Kingdom (UK) telephone system that provided trunk switching facilities within its own charge group and to Group <b>Switching</b> <b>Centres</b> (GSC) within an area broadly comprising the West Midlands and central Wales. The exchange formed part of the trunk mechanisation plan commenced in 1939 to permit operators from originating GSCs to dial through to a distant UK subscriber without requiring further operator intervention. Later, it was additionally used to switch subscriber dialled trunk calls after its introduction at Bristol in 1958.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} days of manual exchanges, {{outlying}} areas (eventually called dependent exchanges) were connected through progressively larger locations (eventually called group <b>switching</b> <b>centres)</b> into one of the main cities - Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, London, and Manchester. As automation began to be established in the network, this was refined into a system of approximately fifty tandem locations for Group <b>Switching</b> <b>Centres,</b> with an additional layer of perhaps a dozen Wide Area Tandems to provide for busy periods, emergency routing, etc. There were also some additional Local Tandems to handle traffic in the London Metropolitan Area without involving the GSCs, although this was a later development, as it required common control signalling for identification.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{adaptive}} traffic routing in telephone networks. At present di mens i oni ng and traffi c routi ng are determi ned {{once a year}} {{in order to meet}} some predefi ned grade of servi ce requirements. For technological reasons, i. e. electromechanical <b>switching</b> <b>centres,</b> call routing is now defined according to some fixed static procedure. In order to provide protection against important di sturbances, the network has then to be overdimensioned at the planning stage. The emergence of stored program control networks consisting of electronic <b>switching</b> <b>centres</b> inter-connected by common channel signalling links is making possible a new strategy- adaptive traffic routing-, which allows real-time reaction to changes of the network state due to overloads or failures. Several adaptive traffic routing algo-ri thms are therefore descri bed and compared on a testbed network in order to improve network performances...|$|R
50|$|SS6 or CCITT No 6 Signalling System was {{introduced}} in the 1970s as an early common channel signalling method for telephone trunks between International <b>Switching</b> <b>Centres</b> (ISCs). It had limited applications since at that time C4 and C5 signalling systems were still flourishing but there was a need to experience common channel working on a fast digital basis.|$|R
50|$|GSM {{consists}} of two components: the mobile radio telephone and Subscriber Identity Module. GSM is a cellular network, which is a radio network {{made up of a}} number of cells. For each cell, the transmitter (known as a base station) is transmitting and receiving signals. The base station is controlled through the Base Station Controller via the Mobile <b>Switching</b> <b>Centre.</b>|$|E
5000|$|It was {{subsequently}} augmented and superseded by a Transit <b>Switching</b> <b>Centre</b> (TSC) {{equipped with a}} crossbar switching system (TXK4) which formed part of the Transit Network. It parented two {{of the first three}} GSCs at Worcester and Wolverhampton [...] to go-live when the transit network was inaugurated in 1971 which eventually provided universal UK automatic subscriber dialling and was completed in 1979.|$|E
5000|$|When someone {{places a}} call to a mobile phone, they dial the {{telephone}} number (also called a MSISDN) associated with the phone user and the call is routed to the mobile phone operator's Gateway Mobile <b>Switching</b> <b>Centre.</b> The Gateway MSC, as the name suggests, acts as the [...] "entrance" [...] from exterior portions of the Public Switched Telephone Network onto the provider's network.|$|E

50|$|Group <b>switching</b> <b>centres</b> were {{required}} {{because it was}} not cost effective to have direct circuits between every exchange in the country. The GSC serving the calling party would act as a concentrator for trunk calls and an operator or, if an STD dialled routing was available, it would establish the call to the appropriate GSC serving the called party's exchange.|$|R
5000|$|Until the Transit System was {{introduced}} in 1971, directly dialled call routings could only involve one intermediate GSC due to transmission requirements, all other calls requiring an operator assisted routing. GSC's were initially based on the Strowger step-by-step system as adopted by the British Post Office for the United Kingdom telephone network. Subsequent developments permitted the use of Crossbar switches designated as TXK1 which offered enhancements such as 2nd attempt routing; a facility not available on Strowger systems. Each of the 639 charging areas was associated or coterminous with one of 230 Group <b>Switching</b> <b>Centres</b> which contained register-translators (Also referred to as GRACE - Group Routing And Charging Equipment) required for local subscribers to originate self dialled trunk calls. During the introduction of International Direct Dialling (IDD), initially referred to as International Subscriber Dialling (ISD) within the UK, Group <b>Switching</b> <b>Centres</b> were equipped with international call timers and international register-translators to route calls to the relevant international exchange for onward routing abroad.|$|R
50|$|Late in the 20th {{century the}} {{smallest}} offices {{were replaced by}} remote concentrators connected to a host office in an adjacent exchange area, which may be several miles away. Others were replaced with distributed switching hardware (a remote <b>switching</b> <b>centre</b> controlled by a digital switch in the city) or with small digital switches such as Nortel's DMS-10 (a self-contained exchange for up to 8000 subscribers).|$|E
50|$|In {{cellular}} wireless networks, such as GSM, the picocell {{base station}} is typically a low-cost, small (typically {{the size of}} a ream of A4 paper), reasonably simple unit that connects to a base station controller (BSC). Multiple picocell 'heads' connect to each BSC: the BSC performs radio resource management and hand-over functions, and aggregates data to be passed to the mobile <b>switching</b> <b>centre</b> (MSC) or the gateway GPRS support node (GGSN).|$|E
5000|$|A CSD call {{functions}} {{in a very}} similar way to a normal voice call in a GSM network. A single dedicated radio time slot is allocated between the phone and the base station. A dedicated [...] "sub-time slot" [...] (16 kbit/s) is allocated from the base station to the transcoder, and finally, another time slot (64 kbit/s) is allocated from the transcoder to the Mobile <b>Switching</b> <b>Centre</b> (MSC).|$|E
