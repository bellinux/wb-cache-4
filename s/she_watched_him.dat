5|$|Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) warns the FBI and BATF that Ephesian and {{his wives}} will be {{released}} in a day unless they can track down Sidney and the Temple's reported weapons cache. The agents question Ephesian, who states {{that there is no}} member of the temple named Sidney. When they interview Melissa, she suddenly begins to talk like Sidney, claiming that Harry Truman is president. Scully believes Melissa is exhibiting multiple personality disorder, but Mulder thinks she is recalling a past life. The agents take her back to the temple, where she takes on the personality of a woman from the Civil War period and says that the weapons were hidden in another secret bunker in the field. She also states that Mulder, in a past life, was a Confederate soldier in the field with her, her beloved, and <b>she</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> die.|$|E
25|$|Diana {{first met}} Charles, Prince of Wales, {{when she was}} 16 in November 1977; he was dating her older sister, Lady Sarah. They were guests at a country weekend {{during the summer of}} 1980 when <b>she</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> play polo and he took a serious {{interest}} in Diana as a potential bride. The relationship progressed when he invited her for a sailing weekend to Cowes aboard the royal yacht Britannia. This was followed by an invitation to Balmoral (the Royal Family's Scottish residence) to meet his family one weekend in November 1980. Lady Diana was well received by the Queen, the Queen Mother and the Duke of Edinburgh. Prince Charles subsequently courted Diana in London. The Prince proposed on 6 February 1981, and Lady Diana accepted, but their engagement was kept secret for the next few weeks.|$|E
2500|$|Goodall's {{research}} at Gombe Stream {{is best known}} to the scientific community for challenging two long-standing beliefs of the day: that only humans could construct and use tools, and that chimpanzees were vegetarians. While observing one chimpanzee feeding at a termite mound, <b>she</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> repeatedly place stalks of grass into termite holes, then remove them from the hole covered with clinging termites, effectively “fishing” for termites. The chimps would also take twigs from trees and strip off the leaves to make the twig more effective, a form of object modification which is the rudimentary beginnings of toolmaking. Humans had long distinguished ourselves {{from the rest of}} the animal kingdom as [...] "Man the Toolmaker". In response to Goodall's revolutionary findings, Louis Leakey wrote, [...] "We must now redefine man, redefine tool, or accept chimpanzees as human!".|$|E

50|$|Buckley Salmon, Susie's {{younger brother}} by 10 years. His {{unplanned}} birth forced Abigail to cancel her {{plans for a}} teaching career. He sometimes sees Susie while <b>she</b> <b>watches</b> <b>him</b> in her heaven.|$|R
2500|$|After Robert Kennedy {{was assassinated}} in 1968, Alice again {{supported}} her friend Richard Nixon, {{just as she had}} done in his 1960 campaign against John F. Kennedy. Her long friendship with Nixon ended {{at the conclusion of the}} Watergate Scandal, specifically when Nixon quoted her father's diary at his resignation, saying, [...] "Only if you've been to the lowest valley can you know how great it is to be on the highest mountain top." [...] This infuriated Alice, who spat curse words at her television screen as <b>she</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> compare his early departure from the White House (in the face of probable impeachment and possible criminal prosecution) to her idealistic young father's loss of his wife and mother on the same day due to illness. Nixon, however, called her [...] "the most interesting [...] " [...] and said, [...] "No one, no matter how famous, could ever outshine her." ...|$|E

50|$|Juniper {{is equally}} taken with Thomas. She and Meredith {{climb to the}} roof, where <b>she</b> <b>watches</b> <b>him</b> walk into the distance. She confides that her {{greatest}} fear is become like her father - trapped and delusional. From that point they become very close friends.|$|R
50|$|Thus, he {{searches}} for her via the newspaper advertisements. Bulldog tells Biscuit that Sea Wife {{died on the}} rescue ship. Heartbroken, Biscuit leaves the grounds and walks past two nuns without noticing that Sea Wife is one of them. <b>She</b> <b>watches</b> <b>him</b> go in silence.|$|R
60|$|He {{came back}} to his place. <b>She</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> a little curiously.|$|E
60|$|He made no answer. <b>She</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> with a {{great and}} growing curiosity.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> closely. The fire in {{his eyes}} was not yet quenched.|$|E
6000|$|... "The word's horrible--say {{rather it}} has 'changed.' Perhaps," [...] Fanny went on, [...] "she did {{wish to see}} how much she can bear. In that case she HAS seen. Only it was she alone who--about the visit--insisted. Her father insists on nothing. And <b>she</b> <b>watches</b> <b>him</b> do it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Eve {{is dressed}} in a long {{raincoat}} and follows the handyman around as he makes his appointed rounds. <b>She</b> <b>watches</b> as he has humorous run-ins while cleaning toilets, taking scrap metal to the dump, cleaning windows, delivering a tree, climbing poles, and remaining a gentleman while trying to help a topless hitchhiker.

60|$|<b>She</b> was <b>watching</b> <b>him,</b> and <b>she</b> {{told herself}} the shot {{had gone to}} its mark.|$|R

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> quietly, but he sat {{very still}} with the rope in his hand.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> with wide, troubled eyes. His {{face was}} {{incandescent}} in its abstract earnestness.|$|E
60|$|Then for {{a moment}} or two she was silent. <b>She</b> was <b>watching</b> <b>him</b> a little curiously.|$|R
50|$|The King comes. She hears {{his steps}} and falls on her face. He stands {{over her and}} grieves over her, himself, and his kingdom, reproaches her, and forgives her. <b>She</b> <b>watches</b> <b>him</b> leave and repents, hoping they will be reunited in heaven. She serves in the abbey, is later chosen Abbess, and dies three years later.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> was <b>watching</b> <b>him</b> {{with that}} curious {{look in her}} eyes which he never wholly understood--half mocking, half tender.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him,</b> watched. And {{he sat in}} {{the chair}} near the door, without moving.|$|E
60|$|He made no answer. <b>She</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> anxiously, {{but there}} was no sign in his face.|$|E

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> {{now through}} the glass with all the unpenetrating minuteness of an impassioned woman's observation.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him,</b> bewildered, {{while he}} put her maid into a cab, and by an effort roused herself.|$|E
60|$|She laughed softly upon him, laughed {{more with}} her eyes than with her lips. <b>She</b> <b>watched</b> <b>him</b> curiously.|$|E
50|$|Marge {{worries that}} her {{listening}} to Kiss albums while pregnant with Bart made {{him what he}} is today as <b>she</b> <b>watches</b> <b>him</b> acting out during Chip Davis' funeral with Milhouse, including removing the church's pew kneelers, hurting everyone's knees when everyone kneels to pray, stealing the collection plates and using them as swords, and stealing Reverend Lovejoy's gown, mocking him.|$|R
6000|$|He sank his {{handsome}} head to his hands, and covered his face. A while he sat huddled there, <b>she</b> <b>watching</b> <b>him</b> with gleaming, crafty eyes. At length he rallied. He looked up, tossing back the auburn hair from his white brow, still fighting, though weakly, against persuasion. [...] "It is not possible," [...] he, cried. [...] "They could not! They could not!" ...|$|R
60|$|The woman kneels {{upon the}} floor, {{with her arms}} crossed on the coverlet of the bed, close by him, and her chin upon them.

Upon that he speaks, {{as if she had}} spoken.|$|R
