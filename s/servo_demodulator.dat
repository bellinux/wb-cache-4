40|$|This paper {{describes}} a <b>servo</b> <b>demodulator</b> which provides dramatically improved performance over the currently used servo demodulation methods for disk drives. The demodulation algorithm proposed here makes {{better use of}} knowledge about the readback signal coming from the disk to provide better noise immunity and more immunity to other non-idealities in the magnetic head response. The net result is a demodulated Position Error Signal (PES) which has a much cleaner response. 1 Introduction This paper {{describes a}}n algorithm for servo demodulation in a disk drive that can significantly lower the Position Sensing Noise (PSN) that gets into the servo channel of a disk drive. It does this by mixing the servo burst signal with an idealized version of the dibit response and integrating over a finite, integral number of periods of the waveform. This di#ers from demodulation schemes which use rectifiers (almost all disk drives). It is also di#erent from the amplitude modulated (AM) signal demodul [...] ...|$|E
