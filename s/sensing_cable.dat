5000|$|With {{regards to}} the {{construction}} of the <b>sensing</b> <b>cable,</b> although it is based on standard fibre optics, care must be taken {{in the design of the}} individual <b>sensing</b> <b>cable</b> to ensure that adequate protection is provided for the fibre. This must take into account operating temperature (standard cables operate to 85°C but it is possible to measure up to 700°C with the correct design), gaseous environment (hydrogen can cause deterioration of the measurement though [...] "hydrogen darkening" [...] - aka attenuation - of the silica glass compounds) and mechanical protection.|$|E
50|$|The {{temperature}} {{measuring system}} {{consists of a}} controller (laser source, pulse generator for OTDR or code generator for Code Correlation or modulator and HF mixer for OFDR, optical module, receiver and micro-processor unit) and a quartz glass fibre as line-shaped temperature sensor. The fibre optic cable (can be 30 km+ in length) is passive in nature and has no individual sensing points and therefore can be manufactured based on standard telecoms fibres. This offers excellent economies of scale. Because the system designer/integrator {{does not have to}} worry about the precise location of each sensing point the cost for designing and installing a sensing system based on distributed fibre optic sensors is greatly reduced from that of traditional sensors. Additionally, because the <b>sensing</b> <b>cable</b> has no moving parts and design lives of 30 years +, the maintenance and operation costs are also considerably less than for conventional sensors. Additional benefits of fibre optic sensing technology are that it is immune to electromagnetic interference, vibration and is safe for use in hazardous zones (the laser power falls below the levels that can cause ignition), thus making these sensors ideal for use in industrial sensing applications.|$|E
5000|$|Manufacturers such as TTK from France [...] have {{introduced}} hi-tech variants like FG-NET touch screen panels with interactive maps on screen. The <b>sensing</b> <b>cables</b> are fitted with micro-controllers patented, that allows unique ability to pin-point faults on every individual <b>sense</b> <b>cable</b> simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|Digital <b>Sense</b> <b>Cables</b> {{consist of}} a braid of {{semi-permeable}} internal conductors protected by a permeable insulating moulded braid. An electrical signal is passed though the internal conductors and is monitored by an inbuilt microprocessor inside the cable connector. Escaping fluids pass through the external permeable braid and {{make contact with the}} internal semi-permeable conductors. This causes a change in the electrical properties of the cable that is detected by the microprocessor. The microprocessor can locate the fluid to within a 1-metre resolution along its length and provide an appropriate signal to monitoring systems or operators. The <b>sense</b> <b>cables</b> can be wrapped around pipelines, buried sub-surface with pipelines or installed as a pipe-in-pipe configuration.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} detect {{distributed}} ground surface deformation, an elastic helical structure Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) <b>sensing</b> <b>cable</b> {{is shown in}} this paper. This special <b>sensing</b> <b>cable</b> consists of three parts: a silicone rubber rope in the center; a couple of parallel wires coiling around the rope; a silicone rubber pipe covering the <b>sensing</b> <b>cable.</b> By analyzing {{the relationship between the}} impedance and the structure of the <b>sensing</b> <b>cable,</b> the impedance model shows that the <b>sensing</b> <b>cable</b> impedance will increase when the cable is stretched. This specific characteristic is verified in the cable stretching experiment which is the base of TDR sensing technology. The TDR experiment shows that a positive reflected signal is created at the stretching deformation point on the <b>sensing</b> <b>cable.</b> The results show that the deformation section length and the stretching elongation will both affect the amplitude of the reflected signal. Finally, the deformation locating experiments show that the <b>sensing</b> <b>cable</b> can accurately detect the deformation point position on the <b>sensing</b> <b>cable...</b>|$|E
40|$|A soil-embedded {{optical fiber}} <b>sensing</b> <b>cable</b> is {{evaluated}} for an embedded cavity detection and sinkhole warning system in railway tunnels. Tests {{were performed on}} a decametric structure equipped with an embedded 110 m long fiber optic cable. Both Brillouin optical time-domain reflectometry (B-OTDR) and optical frequency-domain reflectometry (OFDR) sensing techniques were used for cable interrogation, yielding results that were in good qualitative agreement with finite-element calculations. Theoretical and experimental comparison enabled physical interpretation {{of the influence of}} ground properties, and the analysis of embedded cavity size and position. A 5 mm embedded cavity located 2 m away from the <b>sensing</b> <b>cable</b> was detected. The commercially available <b>sensing</b> <b>cable</b> remained intact after soil collapse. Specificities of each technique are analyzed in view of the application requirements. For tunnel monitoring, the OFDR technique was determined to be more viable than the B-OTDR due to higher spatial resolution, resulting in better detection and size determination of the embedded cavities. Conclusions of this investigation gave outlines for future field use of distributed strain-sensing methods under railways and more precisely enabled designing a warning system suited to the Ebersviller tunnel specificities...|$|E

40|$|International audienceDistributed Fiber Optic Systems (DOFS) are an {{emerging}} and innovative technology that allows long-range and continuous strain/temperature monitoring {{with a high}} resolution. However, strain profiles measured in the optical fiber may differ from actual strain in the structure, due to the shear transfer through the intermediate material layers between the optical fiber and the host material (i. e., in the protective coating of the <b>sensing</b> <b>cable</b> and in the adhesive). Therefore, fiber optic sensors need to be qualified {{in order to provide}} accurate quantitative strain measurements. This study presents a methodology for the qualification of a DOFS. It is proposed to establish a numerical modeling of the system, in which the mechanical parameters are calibrated from experiments. A specific surface-mounted <b>sensing</b> <b>cable</b> connected to an Optical Frequency Reflectometry Domain (OFDR) interrogator is considered as case study.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{deals with}} the testing of {{innovative}} Optical Fibre Sensing (OFS) cables deployed on ducts, with the aim to perform distributed temperature and strain measurements. Such cables contain several optical fibres devoted to be interrogated by Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometry (OFDR). The methodology has first been developed and qualified in laboratory. Then, real tests have been performed on a Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) drain system to demonstrate the industrial feasibility of such technology. To do so, two small diameter sensing cables, compatible with distributed temperature and strain measurements, have been qualified and afterwards installed along a sodium drain line at Superph NPP (liquid sodium coolant fast breeder reactor in current dismantling). Measurements have been performed during the preheating operation. Recorded data were post-processed according to a semi-empirical model taking into account temperature dependence and thermo-mechanical <b>sensing</b> <b>cable</b> behaviour. Optical fibre distributed temperature measurements were then successfully compared to thermocouple reference measurements, whereas optical <b>sensing</b> <b>cable</b> data were processed to provide distributed strain, then distributed curvature radius, which will enable, after numerical integration, to compute distributed displacement data.

40|$|International audienceStructural Health Monitoring (SHM) {{is a key}} {{procedure}} in infrastructure lifecycle management, since it enables a real-time diagnosis {{of the state of}} damage of the structure. As a complement to conventional sensors, Distributed Optical Fiber Sensors (DOFS) have gradually played a prominent role in SHM for the last decade. DOFS are composed of an optoelectronic device paired with an optical fiber in a cable. DOFS can provide strain profiles over several kilometers with few microstrains accuracy. Several optoelectronic devices exist based on the analysis of backscattered light in the silica of the optical fiber. An Optical BackscatterReflectometer (OBR) performs strain measurements with a centimeter spatialresolution. Embedding a <b>sensing</b> <b>cable</b> in a concrete structure developing cracks led to the appearance of peaks on strain profile provided by the OBR. These strain peaks measured in the optical fiber {{can be explained by the}} shear deformation of the protective coating of the cable. The relation between the strain in the optical fiber and the actual one in the embedding medium is called the Mechanical Transfer Function (MTF) of the cable. Knowing the cable's MTF, strain profiles and especially strain peaks could be analyzed by a deconvolution algorithm, so as to automatically detect, localize and determine the evolution of cracking in the concrete structure. The developed algorithm was applied on OBR measurements performed in a reinforced concrete beam, equipped with a <b>sensing</b> <b>cable,</b> and submitted to a 4 points bending loading. For an end-user point of view, this kind of algorithm really completes DOFS devices, so as to get an efficient tool for SHM...|$|E
40|$|When {{it comes}} to {{evaluating}} traditional computational leak detection technologies pipeline operators have a suite of simulated testing methods available. In {{the last several years}} however External Leak Detection Technologies have become more mature and potentially could provide operators with another layer of leak detection with more sensitivity than seen in traditional methods. The challenge with these technologies is in the evaluation of their sensitivity, reliability, and robustness. ENBRIDGE INC (Enbridge) and C-FER Technologies 1999 Inc. (C-FER) begun a comprehensive study to assess the state-of-the-art external, continuously distributed sensors for leak detection in early 2012. Initially, a technology review was undertaken to identify commercial, off-the-shelf technologies with the potential to detect small leaks of oil from buried pipelines. From this literature review, four technologies were identified; Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS), Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS), Vapor Sensing Tubes (VST), and Hydrocarbon <b>Sensing</b> <b>Cables</b> (HSC). All four methods require proprietary materials and technology, which have had limited independent testing efforts to date. To evaluate these four leak detection methods and their vendors in an objective way, Enbridge and C-FER initiated the design and construction of a large-scale External Leak Detection Experimental Research apparatus (ELDER) that can accommodate a full-size segment of pipeline within a trench, at the same scale used in pipeline construction in North America. An instrumented pipe segment is buried in the trench with <b>sensing</b> <b>cables</b> laid alongside. The apparatus generates leaks with controlled variables including rate, pressure and temperature, and at various locations to accurately represent pipeline leaks. This paper summarizes the literature review on the four selected leak detection technologies that were identified as candidates for large-scale evaluation. The discussion will also include features of the ELDER apparatus, and re-engineered pipeline construction techniques that were required to accurately represent a full-scale pipeline trench within a laboratory environment.

40|$|AbstractHigh-sensitivity {{monitoring}} {{solutions are}} crucial for early warning systems of earth structures. In this paper, {{we discuss the}} design and implementation of such systems for natural and engineered slopes using two case studies. At the Gradenbach Observatory, one key element of the monitoring system is a large fiber optic strain rosette embedded in the slope. We demonstrate that the strain rosette can depict landslide deformations much earlier than geodetic sensors like GPS or total stations and is therefore well suitable for an early warning system. In a second application we report {{the construction of a}} reinforced earth structure using geogrids. A distributed fiber optic measurement system was installed to measure the current operating grade of the geogrids within the earth structure.

30|$|This paper {{presents}} the testing results of {{three types of}} fire detectors: electrical heat <b>sensing</b> <b>cable,</b> optical fiber Raman temperature sensing detector, and optical fiber Bragg grating (FBG) temperature sensing detector, in two simulated fire scenes in a cable tunnel. In the small-scale fire with limited thermal radiation and no flame, the fire alarm only comes from the heat sensors which directly contact with the heat source. In the large-scale fire with about 5 °C/min temperature rising speed within a 3 -m span, the fire alarm response time of the fiber Raman sensor and FBG sensors was about 30 seconds. The test results can be further used for formulating regulation for early fire detection in cable tunnels.|$|E
40|$|Distributed Optical Fiber Systems (DOFS) are an {{emerging}} and innovative technology that allows long-range and continuous strain/temperature monitoring {{with a high}} resolution. Sensing cables are either surface mounted or embedded into civil engineering structures to ensure long-term structural monitoring and early crack detection. However, strain profiles measured in the optical fiber (OF) may differ from actual strain in the structure, due to the shear transfer through the intermediate material layers between the OF and the host material (i. e., in the protective coating of the <b>sensing</b> <b>cable</b> and in the adhesive). Therefore, optical fiber sensors (OFS) need to be qualified to provide accurate quantitative strain measurements. This study presents a methodology for the qualification of a DOFS. This qualification is achieved through the calculation of the so-called Mechanical Transfer Function (MTF), which relates the strain profile in the OF to the actual strain profile in the structure. It is proposed to establish a numerical modeling of the system, in which the mechanical parameters are calibrated from experiments. A specific surface-mounted <b>sensing</b> <b>cable</b> connected to an Optical Frequency Reflectometry Domain (OFDR) interrogator is considered as case study. It was found that (i) tensile and pull-out tests can provide full information about materials and interfaces of the numerical modeling; (ii) the calibrated model {{made it possible to}} compute strain profiles along the OF and therefore to calculate the MTF of the system, (iii) which proved to be consistent with experimental data collected on a cracked concrete beam during a 4 -point bending test. This paper is organized as follows: first, the technical background related to DOFS and interrogators is briefly recalled. Then, the MTF is defined and the abovementioned methodology is presented. In a second part, this methodology is applied to the specific cable. Finally, a confrontation with experimental evidences validates the proposed approach...|$|E

A robust sensor package can be designed with either circumferential <b>sensing</b> <b>cable</b> or radial sensing rake for quasi-distributing multiple fiber sensors in the gas turbine environment.

The fibre <b>sensing</b> <b>cable</b> is deployed at the predefined failure surface and interrogated by means of optical frequency domain reflectometry. The strain evolution is measured with centimetre spatial resolution until the occurrence of the slope failure.

40|$|Triggered remote seismic {{events have}} been widely studied in the {{earthquake}} engineering context where various possible explanations have been provided, including directivity of dynamic stresses, a critically stressed environment, the presence of hydrothermal geological environments at remote distances, and so on. Similar events have been observed in underground mining regions; however, they have rarely been studied {{in terms of the}} underlying mechanisms such as the presence of faults of marginal stability, increases in the stress gradient between mined out regions as a result of connective fractures, unclamping effect on geological features such as dikes or joint swarms, and so on. This research was triggered in part by the hypothesis that remote seismic events in mines could be triggered when gravity-driven displacements are transferred to distances far from active mining (10 ’s to 100 ’s of metres). Accordingly, the thesis focuses on experimental research on a novel deformation sensing sensor for future verification of this assumption. A secondary focus is mathematical modeling to help understand the deformation mechanisms and magnitudes that may take place in a jointed rock mass. Distributed Brillouin sensing systems (DBSs) have found growing applications in engineering and are attracting attention in the field of underground structures including mining. The capability for continuous measurements of strain over large distances makes DBSs a promising monitoring approach for understanding deformation field evolution within a rock mass, particularly when the sensor is installed away from “excavation damaged zones” (EDZ). A purpose-built fiber optic <b>sensing</b> <b>cable,</b> a vital component of DBSs, was assessed in laboratory conditions to establish the capability and limitations of this technology to monitor deformation fields over large distances. A test program was performed to observe DBSs response to various perturbations including axial and shear strain resulting from joint movements. These tests included assessments of the strain-free cable response and the application of extensional and lateral displacement to various <b>sensing</b> <b>cable</b> lengths (strained lengths from 1 m down to 1 cm). Furthermore, tests were done to evaluate the time-dependent behavior of the cable and to observe the effect of strain transfer using a soft host material (i. e., a soft grout) under lateral displacement. The noise level of the DBSs range was ± 77 µε, determined through repeated measurements on an unstrained cable. Stretching test results showed a linear correlation between the applied strain and the Brillouin frequency shift change for all strained lengths above half the spatial resolution of the DBSs. However, for strained lengths shorter than half the spatial resolution, no strain response was measurable and {{this is due to the}} applied internal signal processing of the DBSs to detect peak Brillouin gain spectrum and noise level. The stability with time of the measurements was excellent for test periods up to 15 hours. Lateral displacement test results showed a less consistent response compared to extension tests for a given applied displacement. The Brillouin frequency shift change is linearly correlated with the applied displacement in tension but it shows a parabolic variation with lateral displacement. Moreover, the registered frequency response (correlated with strain) of the system decreased significantly when the <b>sensing</b> <b>cable</b> was embedded in a sand-filled tube compared with direct cable displacement. A comprehensive laboratory scale testing program was undertaken to study the response of the system to different loading paths in time and space domains. Purely extensional displacement fields were applied to demonstrate that the system could produce repeatable displacement responses for three different configurations of distributed strained patterns. A borehole installation method was developed by testing the sensing cable’s response while embedded in mortar beams. When the cable is directly embedded in the mortar, uncontrolled self-debonding happens that introduces uncertainties in the measurements. This limitation was overcome by anchoring debonded sections of the <b>sensing</b> <b>cable</b> at regular spacing. This arrangement produced consistent strain patterns for each strained interval. It was shown that the performance of the debonded sections changes for longer anchor spacing and for closely spaced joints where more than one joint crosses the debonded interval. The influence of borehole diameter and strength of the filling material were evaluated for their possible effects on the strain transfer process to the <b>sensing</b> <b>cable.</b> With the anchored arrangement of debonded cables, these properties of the grout did not have a measurable effect on the results, and as long as the tensile strength of the grout is low enough to break at the joint locations, the strain transfer performance from the rockmass to the <b>sensing</b> <b>cable</b> was excellent. A study was devoted to understanding such a deformation monitoring system under various shear displacement conditions. These included the difference in response of the system in direct shear compared to tests performed in direct tension. The system response was evaluated for various strained lengths as well as distances over which the bending strains are acting (kink lengths). The latter was found to be an important factor influencing monitoring results. In addition, the system behavior under shear displacement where the sensor is inclined with respect to the joint strike was evaluated to understand the effect of a combined extension and shear displacement. The effect of the existence of two joints over the strained lengths was assessed in both direct and inclined shear. A new relation was established between the registered Brillouin frequency shift change and all contributing components of deformation when the sensor is elongated while under shear displacement. The testing program shows that Distributed Brillouin Sensing (DBS) technology has promise for detecting deformations over long distances. Not only strain localization occurring at pre-existing discontinuities or at developing cracks can be detected by this sensor, but also strain levels well below the typical damage initiation threshold (~ 0. 1 %) for hard brittle rocks are above the basic noise level of the system. However, the sensing element is quite fragile when under shear displacement and can easily break at small shear displacements. Therefore, it is better to have an idea of the dominant deformation mechanism in the rock mass before the installation of the sensor. The sensor would be much more durable where the rock mass experiences less shearing. Mathematical simulations of a 2 D rock mass were carried out using the distinct element method. Two major parameters including interlocking degree and pre-existing conditions such as mined-out zones at higher levels were studied. Different rock mass models with varying block sizes, joint set orientations, and joint persistency were built to study the effect of interlock on the displacement pattern away from mining. In general, displacement as large as 5 cm could travel distances as far as 500 m away from the active mining zone. The exact displacement pattern is largely controlled by the characteristics of the joints sets. However, the transfer of large displacements was limited to distances of the size of the mining boundary, where rock mass interlocking promote arching. Furthermore, with non-persistent joint sets, a few shear slip events were noticed at higher levels whereas more remote joints did not show slip. All slip events were close to the mining boundary. Remote shear slip events, could not be generated by changing parameters representing the degree of interlock in the rock mass. When a backfilled old mine was added to the middle height of the model, some 500 m away from active mining, results showed that a large number of joints around the old mining zone slipped due to displacements induced by the distant deeper mining. It was found that the pre-existing excavation and the mine extraction strategy is a critical factor for providing conditions under which such slip events at remote distances occur from active mining...|$|E

In this study, distributed fibre optic <b>sensing</b> (DFOS) <b>cables,</b> embedded in a pile during concreting, are used to measure the changes in concrete curing temperature profile to infer concrete cover thickness through modelling of heat transfer processes within the concrete and adjacent ground. A field trial was conducted at a high-rise building construction site in London during the construction of a 51 m long test pile. DFOS cables were attached to the reinforcement cage of the pile at four different axial directions to obtain distributed temperature change data along the pile. The monitoring data shows a clear development of concrete hydration temperature with time and the pattern of the change varies due to small changes in concrete cover. A one-dimensional axisymmetric heat transfer finite element (FE) model is used to estimate the pile geometry with depth by back analysing the DFOS data.

40|$|Distributed {{fiber optic}} sensing {{presents}} unique features that have no match in conventional sensing techniques. The ability to measure temperatures and strain at thousands of points along a single fiber is particularly interesting for the monitoring of elongated structures such as pipelines, flow lines, oil wells and coiled tubing. Sensing systems based on Brillouin and Raman scattering are used for example to detect pipeline leakages, verify pipeline operational parameters, prevent failure of pipelines installed in landslide areas, optimize oil production from wells and detect hot-spots in high-power cables. Recent developments in distributed fiber sensing technology allow the monitoring of 60 km of pipeline from a single instrument and of up to 300 km {{with the use of}} optical amplifiers. New application opportunities have demonstrated that the design and production of sensing cables is a critical element for the success of any distributed sensing instrumentation project. Although some telecommunication cables can be effectively used for sensing ordinary temperatures, monitoring high and low temperatures or distributed strain present unique challenges that require specific cable designs. This contribution presents advances in long-range distributed sensing and in novel <b>sensing</b> <b>cable</b> designs for distributed temperature and strain sensing. The paper also reports a number of significant field application examples of this technology, including leakage detection on brine and gas pipelines, strain monitoring on gas pipelines and combined strain and temperature monitoring on composite flow lines and composite coiled-tubing pipes...|$|E
40|$|This Project {{develops}} {{the design and}} implementation of a mechanical and electronic flight controls system, to enable a flight simulation in a real McDonell Douglas DC- 9 - 34 cabin using the real airplane flight controls. At first are shown the objectives and requirements to be achieved with the project implementation. Then it is performed an study of the airplane {{to know more about}} the real flight controls operation, which are inoperative for having only the front fuselage section. Being a project with a practical part, the working environment develops in the fuselage, therefore the different workspaces are described. The current airplane condition and flight control mechanical systems are analized before starting design development. The design of the new system is based on two characteristic points for theoretical development. The data acquisition point, corresponding to mechanical part ant the sensor that performs reading of data system, corresponding to electronic part. With the previous analysis of the aircraft, choosing the data acquisition point and sensor type, the final design is developed to use like a roadmap for practice implementation in the airplane. At last describe in detail the implementation process of the new flight control system in the airplane. The movement transmission of cabin flight controls is done with mechanical control cable system, this is the movement data acquisition point of flight controls. Data <b>sensing</b> of <b>cable</b> system movement is done with a potentiometer sensor. Then the output signal of sensors may be transformed and adapted for use in a flight simulation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHighly {{distributed}} {{temperature data}} {{are used as}} input and as calibration data for a temperature model of a first order stream in Luxembourg. A DTS (Distributed Temperature <b>Sensing)</b> fiber optic <b>cable</b> with a length of 1500 m is used to measure stream water temperature with a spatial resolution of 0. 5 m and a temporal resolution of 2 min. With the observations four groundwater inflows are found and quantified (both temperature and relative discharge). They are used as input for the distributed temperature model presented here. The model calculates the total energy balance including solar radiation (with shading effects), longwave radiation, latent heat, sensible heat and river bed conduction. The simulated temperature along the whole stream is compared with the measured temperature at all points along the stream. It shows that proper knowledge of the lateral inflow is crucial to simulate the temperature distribution along the stream, and, {{the other way around}} stream temperature can be used successfully to identify runoff components. The DTS fiber optic is an excellent tool to provide this knowledge...|$|R

The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at Springer via [URL] Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011 Being able to significantly reduce system installation time and cost, wireless sensing technology has attracted much interest in the structural health monitoring (SHM) community. This paper reports the field application of a wireless sensing system on a 4 -span highway bridge located in Wayne, New Jersey in the US. Bridge vibration due to traffic and ambient excitation is measured. To enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, a low-noise high-gain signal conditioning module is developed for the wireless sensing system. Nineteen wireless and nineteen cabled accelerometers are first installed along the sidewalk of two neighboring bridge spans. The performance of the wireless sensing system is compared with the high-precision <b>cabled</b> <b>sensing</b> system. In the next series of testing, sixteen wireless accelerometers are installed under the deck of another bridge span, forming a 4 × 4 array. Operating deflection analysis is successfully conducted using the wireless measurement of traffic and ambient vibrations. National Science Foundatio...|$|R
