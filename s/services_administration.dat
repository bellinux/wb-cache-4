5|$|In {{what would}} later become the second of two {{tropical}} cyclones to form within the basin during November 1988, an area of disturbed weather was first noted by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) early on November1. Six hours later, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started following the system. The same day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical <b>Services</b> <b>Administration</b> also started to track the storm and assigned it with the local name Welpring.|$|E

5|$|The {{base was}} {{reactivated}} on 15 July 1961, {{but the only}} personnel based there were a fifteen-man firefighting detachment. By 1962, when the base was again deactivated, only 128 of the original 668 buildings remained. The General <b>Services</b> <b>Administration</b> (GSA) wanted to sell the base {{to the town of}} Wendover, leaving only the bombing ranges and radar site with the Air Force. The base was renamed Decker Field, and again declared surplus in 1972. The base continued to be used occasionally for training by Air National Guard units, and the firefighting detachment remained until 1977.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Rammasun, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Butchoy, was {{recognized}} as the second typhoon of the 2008 Pacific typhoon season by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) and the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical <b>Services</b> <b>Administration</b> (PAGASA). Rammasun was also recognised as the third tropical storm, the second typhoon and the first super typhoon of the 2008 Pacific typhoon season by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC).|$|E
5|$|Upon being {{classified}} as a tropical depression, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical <b>Services</b> <b>Administration</b> issued Public Storm Warning Signal #1 for Samar, Leyte, the Camotes Islands, Surigao del Norte, Siargao Island, and Dinagat Island as winds up to 60km/h (37mph) were expected to affect those areas. Three hours later, Biliran Island was also put under the warning signal. On January4, all signals, except in Eastern Samar, were lifted as Auring recurved and {{moved away from the}} Philippines. The warning signal for Eastern Samar was lifted early the next day.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance developed northeast of Yap on July 7 and slowly increased in organization. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the disturbance {{later that day}} as it moved northwestward. By July 8, it had developed sufficient convection to be designated a tropical depression by the JTWC and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). The depression continued to strengthen, and was designated Tropical Storm Bilis by the JMA early on July 9. The JTWC upgraded Bilis to tropical storm status later that day. On July 10, Bilis moved into the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical <b>Services</b> <b>Administration</b> (PAGASA), and was designated Tropical Storm Florita for local warnings.|$|E
5|$|About 18 hours later, the {{depression}} was upgraded to {{a tropical storm}} and given the name Dan. The cyclone moved westward at , and convection continued to mature. Outflow was good across most of the system, except the northwestern corner where it was restricted by interaction with a nearby typhoon. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical <b>Services</b> <b>Administration</b> also monitored the storm, assigning it with the local name Saling. The JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm on October 9; both agencies recognized it as a typhoon the next day after an eye became visible and outflow improved in the northwestern quadrant. Dan made landfall on the southeastern coast of Luzon in the Philippines, and its center tracked {{just south of the}} Ninoy Aquino International Airport.|$|E
5|$|By July15, Typhoon Ma-on had a {{well-defined}} eye with the strongest convection in its southern periphery. It continued intensifying, and the JTWC estimated 1-minute sustained winds of 220km/h (135mph). Late on July15, Ma-on weakened slightly due to stronger wind shear, which caused its eyewall to break {{apart in the}} northwest quadrant. It re-intensified the next day after an eyewall replacement cycle commenced. At 0600UTC on July16, the JMA estimated peak 10-minute sustained winds of 175km/h (110mph) while the typhoon was located about 1185km (735mi) southeast of Okinawa. Around that time, Ma-on began a motion to the northwest due to a weakening of the subtropical ridge, and it briefly entered the area warned by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical <b>Services</b> <b>Administration</b> (PAGASA); the agency gave it the local name Ineng.|$|E

5|$|Following the system's {{classification}} as {{a tropical}} cyclone, the depression maintained a west-southwesterly track {{in response to}} a subtropical ridge to the north. On July12, it is estimated that the depression intensified into a tropical storm, at which time it was given the name Gordon by the JTWC. Due to the cyclone's proximity to the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical <b>Services</b> <b>Administration</b> also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Goring. During the afternoon of July13, Gordon briefly turned southwestward as it attained typhoon status before returning to a more westerly track later that day.|$|E

In late June 2013 Lovato announced {{the creation of the}} Lovato Treatment Scholarship Program, named for her late father, to pay treatment costs for mentally-ill patients. In August 2013, she traveled to Kenya for her 21st birthday to participate in a program of the international charity organization Free the Children.|$|E
5|$|Nelson tracked westward, staying {{south of}} a large {{subtropical}} ridge. Despite the aforementioned favorable environment, Nelson briefly weakened late on March19, but re-intensified slightly the following morning. Shortly thereafter, the JTWC upgraded the system into a typhoon. Further intensification was halted due to increased easterly wind shear, and the storm began to level off in intensity as it accelerated on a westward course. On March21, the JMA declared Nelson a severe tropical storm. According to the JTWC, the storm fluctuated between tropical storm and typhoon status for about 60hours, even though the JMA suggest that Nelson did not become a typhoon until March24. Around this time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical <b>Services</b> <b>Administration</b> (PAGASA) also started monitoring the storm, assigning it with the local name Bising.|$|E
