5|$|Bond {{attacks the}} house where Breed is <b>staying</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> children, and incapacitates the mercenary, leaving him for dead. He {{establishes}} that the children are being used as drug mules to smuggle raw heroin into the country and locates Solomon Adeka, {{who had not been}} killed in Africa, but been turned into a heroin addict in order to control him. Adeka's older brother had been killed in London, ensuring Solomon became chief of the tribe whose lands held massive amounts of oil: as he was an addict, these rights were signed away in favour of Hulbert Linck. Linck was killed by the CIA during the raid on the house.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} and most important surveyors of Kīlauea was James Dwight Dana, who, <b>staying</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> missionary Titus Coan, studied the island's volcanoes in detail for decades first-hand. Dana visited Kīlauea's summit and described it in detail in 1840. After publishing a summary paper in 1852, he directed a detailed geological study of the island in 1880 and 1881 but did not consider Kīlauea a separate volcano, instead referring {{to it as a}} flank vent of Mauna Loa; it was not until another geologist, C. E. Dutton, had elaborated on Dana's research during an 1884 expedition that Kīlauea came to be generally accepted as a separate entity.|$|E

5|$|After {{seeing a}} {{production}} of Hamlet starring Sir Frank Benson, Richardson decided to become an actor and made his stage debut, playing a gendarme in The Bishop's Candlesticks in December 1920. After touring and appearing in rep, he made his London debut in July 1926 as the stranger in Oedipus at Colonus. In 1930 he joined the Old Vic where he first met Gielgud, <b>staying</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> company until the following year. After service during the Second World War with the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, he returned to acting, preferring {{the works of the}} more modern authors Luigi Pirandello, Joe Orton, Harold Pinter, George Bernard Shaw and J. B. Priestley to the classic plays of Shakespeare. A radio career ran in parallel to that on the stage, and Richardson was first broadcast in The City in 1929.|$|E
5|$|As Emma, Mary Margaret, and Graham {{search the}} wooded area for John Doe, they {{are joined by}} Henry. Henry {{believes}} that the patient is looking for Mary Margaret. They soon discover the patient lying near the bridge seen in the fairytale flashback, and Mary Margaret revives him. As they take {{him back to the}} hospital, Regina shows up with a woman named Kathryn (Griffith), and states that she is his wife and that the patient's name is David Nolan. This devastates Mary Margaret, as she had begun to develop feelings for the patient. Emma becomes suspicious of Regina's ability to find Nolan's wife and questions why Kathryn never bothered to search for him before. Although Regina claims that past hospital surveillance tapes had David mentioning Kathryn's name in his sleep, Emma still believes that Regina is lying. Later that evening, Emma arrives at Mary Margaret's place and agrees to take up the offer of <b>staying</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> teacher.|$|E
5|$|Henry's 2006–07 {{season was}} marred by injuries. Although he scored 10 goals in 17 {{domestic}} appearances for Arsenal, Henry's season was cut short in February. Having missed games due to hamstring, foot, and back problems, he was deemed fit enough to come on as a late substitute against PSV in a Champions League match, but began limping shortly after coming on. Scans the next day revealed that he would need at least three months to heal from new groin and stomach injuries, missing {{the rest of the}} 2006–07 season. Wenger attributed Henry's injuries to a protracted 2005–06 campaign, and reiterated that Henry was keen on <b>staying</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Gunners to rebuild for the 2007–08 season.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} met in Limoges {{and then}} withdrew to Poitiers and Bordeaux, {{but as the}} French military situation deteriorated, became split over what should happen. The government was split between those who supported staying in France or <b>staying</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> French government and those who supported withdrawing to the United Kingdom. Pierlot supported retreating to London, but was keen to preserve the unity of his government, most of which supported remaining in France. Hoping to keep the Belgian Congo under Belgian sovereignty, Pierlot allowed the Minister of the Colonies, Albert de Vleeschauwer, to leave France while the government met to consider whether it should resign {{to make way for}} a new constitutional authority in occupied Brussels.|$|E
5|$|In 1828, Ernest was <b>staying</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> King at Windsor Castle when severe {{disturbances}} {{broke out}} in Ireland among Catholics. The Duke was an ardent supporter of the Protestant cause in Ireland, and returned to Berlin in August, believing that the Government, led by the Duke of Wellington, would deal firmly with the Irish. In January 1829, the Wellington Government {{announced that it would}} introduce a Catholic emancipation bill to conciliate the Irish. Disregarding a request from Wellington that he remain abroad, Ernest returned to London, {{and was one of the}} leaders against the Catholic Relief Act 1829, influencing King George against the bill. Within days of his arrival, the King instructed the officers of his Household to vote against the Bill. Hearing of this, Wellington told the King that he must resign as Prime Minister unless the King could assure him of complete support. The King initially accepted Wellington's resignation, and Ernest attempted to put together a government united against Catholic emancipation. Though such a government would have considerable support in the House of Lords, it would have little support in the Commons, and Ernest abandoned his attempt. The King recalled Wellington. The bill passed the Lords and became law.|$|E
5|$|The 2014 Yellow Jackets, {{despite being}} {{predicted}} to finish 5th in Coastal Division by ESPN, garnered a 10-2 regular season record (6-2 ACC), including wins over then No. 19 Clemson and No. 9 Georgia {{to finish the}} regular season ranked No. 11 by the College Football Playoff Committee. The highlight of the season came when Georgia Tech defeated the Bulldogs in Athens in an overtime game that featured numerous swings in momentum. After a couple of controversial calls that gave UGA the advantage, the Rambling Wreck fought back, <b>staying</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Bulldogs. With 18 seconds left, the Yellow Jackets delivered 30-yard drive that ended up with Harrison Butker's 53-yard field goal sending the game into overtime. After a 1-yard rushing touchdown by Georgia Tech RB Zack Laskey, the win was clinched by the Jackets when cornerback D.J. White intercepted UGA quarterback, Hutson Mason. Georgia Tech won the Atlantic Coast Conference Coastal Division and met No. 4 Florida State in the 2014 ACC Championship Game in Charlotte, North Carolina, losing 37-35. The 2014 appearance marked Georgia Tech's third ACC Championship Game in seven seasons under Paul Johnson. With {{the advent of the}} College Football Playoff, Florida State was chosen in the top four (ranked No. 3), under which circumstance the Orange Bowl selected Georgia Tech, now ranked No. 12, as its replacement to face the No. 7 Mississippi State Bulldogs on December 31, 2014. In the orange bowl game, Justin Thomas led the Jackets to a dominating 49-34 win over No. 7 Mississippi State.
