5000|$|The {{full stroke}} {{begins with the}} tip of the {{drumstick}} held 8-12" [...] above the <b>striking</b> surface. The <b>drummer</b> <b>strikes</b> the <b>drum</b> and then returns the stick back up to its original position.|$|R
25|$|The Thammattama is flat, two-faced <b>drum.</b> The <b>drummer</b> <b>strikes</b> the <b>drum</b> {{on the two}} {{surfaces}} on {{top with}} sticks, unlike the others where you drum on the sides. This is a companion drum to the afore mentioned Dawula.|$|R
50|$|The Thammattama is a flat, two faced <b>drum.</b> The <b>drummer</b> <b>strikes</b> the <b>drum</b> {{on the two}} {{surfaces}} on {{top with}} sticks, unlike the other traditional Sri Lankan drums, which are played by striking {{the sides of the}} instrument. In the Hewisi Ensemble, this may be a companion drum to the aforementioned Dawula.|$|R
50|$|One of John Donald's {{signature}} techniques is the <b>striking</b> <b>drum</b> or crown mount. Framed by {{a protective}} basket of textured gold, gems are {{set at the}} end of tiny rods to form glittering openwork constellations. He has modestly said that the method was developed as a way round his lack of conventional skills, however fixing the narrow rods into their tiny screw-holes requires a high level of technical expertise. The mounts are wholly unique and allow a delicacy of setting almost impossible with more traditional designs.|$|R
50|$|In Japan, the Shinto god Raijin is {{considered}} the god of lightning and thunder. He is depicted as a demon who <b>strikes</b> a <b>drum</b> to create lightning.|$|R
25|$|Although {{not totally}} silent {{because they are}} still an {{instrument}} you <b>strike,</b> electronic <b>drums</b> and their counterpart devices usually produce considerably less acoustic noise than a traditional drum kit.|$|R
25|$|Muffled or mute tone (tono ahogado): {{like the}} open tone, {{is made by}} <b>striking</b> the <b>drum</b> with the four fingers, but holding the fingers against the head to muffle the tone.|$|R
50|$|In other genres, {{particularly}} in the traditional music of many countries, drummers use individual drums of various sizes and designs rather than drum kits. Some use only their hands to <b>strike</b> the <b>drums.</b>|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the usual}} {{technique}} of stroking with wrist motion, in fingersnapping, the drummer uses {{his finger to}} cause the stick to <b>strike</b> the <b>drum.</b> There should be very little, if any, wrist motion.|$|R
50|$|The {{down stroke}} {{begins with the}} tip {{at the same height}} as the full stroke, but upon <b>{{striking}}</b> the <b>drum</b> head, the drummer keeps the stick low (about an inch above the striking surface).|$|R
50|$|Music is also {{important}} among the Ibaloi, with the Jew’s harp, nose flute, native guitar, bamboo <b>striking</b> instruments, <b>drums,</b> gongs, and many others. They are considered sacred, and must always be played for a reason.|$|R
50|$|Symbols moving {{horizontally}} along {{a timeline}} show what to hit and when. Home versions distinguish single and double strikes, arcade versions hard and soft <b>strikes.</b> A <b>drum</b> simulating the taiko is played {{in time with}} music.|$|R
50|$|Clapsticks or clappers are {{a type of}} drumstick, {{percussion}} mallet or claves {{that serve}} to maintain rhythm in Aboriginal voice chants. Unlike drumsticks, which are generally used to <b>strike</b> a <b>drum,</b> clapsticks are intended for striking one stick on another.|$|R
2500|$|The bass {{sound is}} {{produced}} by <b>striking</b> the <b>drum</b> with the palm and flat fingers {{near the center of}} the skin. Tone and slap are produced by <b>striking</b> the <b>drum</b> closer to the edge; the contact area of the fingers determines whether the sound is a tone or a slap. For a tone, most of the area of the fingers and the edge of the palm contact the skin whereas, for a slap, the contact area is limited to the edge of the palm and the fingertips. The basic sounds are played [...] "open", meaning that the hands rebound immediately after a strike, so the contact time with the skin is as short as possible.|$|R
25|$|Following {{the release}} of the Busted at Oz LP, Fisher was briefly {{replaced}} by <b>Strike</b> Under <b>drummer</b> Bob Furem. DA! recorded the Time Will Be Kind EP with Powell at Sound Impressions in late 1981, but by the time of its 1982 release, the group had disbanded.|$|R
50|$|A clapstick {{is a type}} {{of musical}} {{instrument}} that, according to western musicological classification, falls into the category of percussion. Unlike drumsticks, which are generally used to <b>strike</b> a <b>drum,</b> clapsticks are intended for striking one stick on another. They are of oval shape with paintings of snakes, lizards, birds and more.|$|R
25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{standard}} beaters mentioned above, implements used to <b>strike</b> the <b>drum</b> may include keyboard percussion mallets, timpani mallets, and drumsticks. The hand or fingers {{can also be used}} (it. con la mano). The playing techniques possible include rolls, repetitions and unison strokes. Bass drums can sometimes be used for sound effects. e.g. thunder, or an earthquake.|$|R

50|$|Last is {{the spectator}} (often a scholar or {{connoisseur}} of the art) who strikes a trống chầu (praise drum) in praise (or disapproval) of the singer's performance, usually with every {{passage of the}} song. The {{way in which he}} <b>strikes</b> the <b>drum</b> shows whether he likes or dislikes the performance, but he always does it according to the beat provided by the vocalists' phách percussion.|$|R
5000|$|A shaman's baton is an {{important}} object for religious celebrations, where it represents the shaman's spirit helper and serves as the tool for <b>striking</b> his <b>drum,</b> which is perceived as [...] "driving the reindeer." [...] The Evenks utilise the baton {{to predict the future}} regarding the growth and welfare of their reindeer herds by throwing the baton towards the inquiring person and determining the answer based on how it falls.|$|R
50|$|The up stroke {{begins with}} the tip of the stick {{hovering}} about an inch above the head of the <b>drum.</b> The <b>drummer</b> <b>strikes</b> the surface, then brings the stick up to full stroke or down stroke position.|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the location at which a drum membrane was struck {{and the quality of}} sound produced was investigated by <b>striking</b> the <b>drum</b> at several distances between the center and the rim. Through analyzing the harmonics of the wave produced from the impact, it was shown that as the striking location changes, the relative amplitudes of different modes of vibration also changes. It was found that sound of a higher pitch is produced at the rim of the drum than anywhere else on the drum head due to higher modes of vibration becoming dominant...|$|R
5000|$|The {{effect can}} be easily {{simulated}} by evenly and repeatedly counting to four. As a background against which to compare these various rhythms a bass <b>drum</b> <b>strike</b> on the downbeat and a constant eighth note subdivision on ride cymbal have been added, which would be counted as follows (bold denotes a stressed beat): ...|$|R
40|$|The {{bass drum}} {{is driven by}} a pedal that {{promotes}} muscle fatigue and can cause injuries. In order to provide engineers with valuable tools, this research aimed at analyzing {{the use of the}} drum pedal and to evaluate qualitatively the muscle groups involved and their possible relationship with any injuries resulting from fatigue. Through the analysis, it was found that <b>striking</b> the <b>drum</b> pedal provides health risks; therefore, some actions were suggested to avoid injuries to drummers. All data collected can be used as parameters for the development of products that would prevent health problems or improve the drummers´ performance...|$|R
50|$|In high school, Kerman {{formed a}} garage band with guitarist Greg Conway and bassist Jon Beck. They {{began as a}} cover band playing a mixture of Deep Purple, King Crimson and Lynyrd Skynyrd songs but soon {{switched}} to experimenting with noise music. Kerman also modified his drum kit to extend its capabilities, including adding telescoping metal tubing that changed pitch (made from old fire extinguishers), and stringing the bass drum shell with heavy-gauge strings that produced an un-tuned zither sound. He also started {{using a variety of}} objects to <b>strike</b> his <b>drum</b> kit with, including kitchen utensils, golf clubs and Barbie dolls.|$|R
5000|$|The tamak' [...] is a stick-struck double-headed drum of the Santal {{people of}} India. The {{body of the}} drum is made from metal and shaped like a large bowl. The head of the drum is usually cowhide and 14-18 inches in diameter. The player <b>strikes</b> the <b>drum</b> {{with a pair of}} drum sticks. The Santal believe that the tamak' has special {{religious}} powers and it is often used for religious ceremonies and Santal festivals. The rhythm of the Tamak' often sets the basic metric/rhythmic pattern for Santal dances and is an essential instrument for traditional Santal music.|$|R

5000|$|The bangu (...) , often simply gu (...) , is a Chinese frame drum that, when {{struck by}} one or two small bamboo sticks, creates a sharp dry sound {{essential}} to the aesthetics of Chinese opera. <b>Striking</b> the <b>drum</b> in different places produces different sounds. It is also used in many Chinese chamber music ensembles. The percussion section {{is very important in}} Chinese Opera, with battle or 'martial' scenes, which are called wu-chang. The bangu player is the director or conductor of the orchestra. He works with {{the other members of the}} percussion section to create the right mood for the audience and actors on stage.|$|R

The number of wheels used, great and small, is [...] in all, with a total of 285 teeth. Thus the motion is transmitted as if by the links of a chain, the [...] "dog-teeth" [...] mutually engaging with each other, so that by due revolution everything comes back to its original starting point.|$|R
50|$|The bukhalo (Ukrainian folk drum kit {{based on}} a bass drum) {{is a type of}} large drum often used in dance music, {{particularly}} popular in Western Ukraine. It is fixed to the player with a belt so that the performer can also dance and move about when needed. The bukhalo is struck with a stick and often has a cymbal joined {{to the side of the}} instrument which is struck by a metal rod, or another cymbal, to produce unexpected rhythmic devices. The sticks are called bubinky. The one used to <b>strike</b> the <b>drum</b> is made of wood, and the one used to strike the cymbal is made of metal.|$|R
50|$|In the 17th century, it was {{believed}} that elephants had very advanced intellectual abilities. Following Pliny, it was thought that the elephant was the nearest to man in intelligence, and that elephants could understand speech, follow orders, and had a sense of religion and conscience. Pliny even reports that an elephant had learned to write words in the Greek alphabet. Hansken did not live up to these expectations, but she could wave a flag, fire a pistol, <b>strike</b> a <b>drum,</b> hold out her front feet, pinch money from pockets, put on a hat, carry a bucket of water, and pick up coins from the ground.|$|R
