500|$|Gregory Ward visits Mary at the daycare {{center where}} she works. Mary admits, [...] "It {{would be easier}} if Jacqueline were dead." [...] At the {{beginning}} of the scene—which remains in the final cut—Mary's supervisor <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> [...] "Aren't you the popular one? You've a visitor again," [...] the last word making it clear she'd had an earlier visitor, Ward.|$|E
500|$|Years later, when Andrew Jackson was {{corresponding}} with Edward Livingston {{he wrote}} [...] "Present {{me in the}} most respectful terms to your aged sister [...] <b>Says</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> if I ever should be within one hundred miles of her dwelling I will visit and have the high honor of shaking by the hand the revered relict of the patriotic Genrl. Montgomery, who will ever live {{in the hearts of}} his countrymen." [...] Three months after this letter, Janet died, on November 6, 1824.|$|E
500|$|TGS head writer Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), {{along with}} {{producer}} Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), decides {{to take the}} show's staff to Miami for a week, due to Liz's hate of the cold weather and the staff's case of [...] "winter madness". Her boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), decides {{to take them to}} Boston instead, so he can see Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore), a woman Jack ponders having a possible romance with. He learns that Nancy's husband has left her as a way of getting her to ask for a divorce, but Nancy refuses to do so, fearing [...] what others might think. Jack admits his true feelings to Nancy and insists that the two talk. She suggests that they should say four words to each other as a way of putting their relationship on hold; Jack <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> [...] "I'll wait. Not forever", while Nancy tells him [...] "I'll try. Wicked hard." ...|$|E

500|$|Miles and Richard get to {{the boat}} they left at the dock. As they are {{undocking}} the boat he reveals to Richard that he is starting to age. When they are rowing to Hydra Island they spot Frank Lapidus drifting in the water in life vests. When they {{get him on the}} boat Frank proposes they leave the island on the plane before the Man in Black comes. Richard and Miles agree. Miles then radios Ben again, saying they have made it to Hydra Island and about his plan about the plane. As he is talking, Claire comes out from the bushes and fires two warning shots to tell them not to come closer. Richard manages to calm her down but she refuses to go on the plane with them. Miles radios a third time. Kate picks up. He <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> they are patching up the plane and getting ready to take off. He tells Kate about Claire not wanting to come with them. Kate then smashes the radio she has. Miles asks Frank how the plane was doing. Frank says he has to check the electrical outlet before they take off. [...] Miles and Richard repair the hydraulics with duct tape, then rejoin Frank in the cockpit.|$|E
2500|$|Atia and Mark Antony have {{resumed their}} affair in [...] "A Necessary Fiction", and Octavian's darker side emerges further when he discovers this {{betrayal}} (and {{the fact that}} Octavia is involved with his friend, Marcus Agrippa). He commands Antony to leave Rome indefinitely, or be publicly shamed with Octavia's adultery, and sends Atia and Octavia into seclusion (under armed guard) at Atia's villa. Antony manages a goodbye at Atia's doorstep with guards keeping them from embracing, and promises that {{when the time is}} right he will send for her. This never happens, and these are the last words he ever <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Most Bond {{girls are}} {{apparently}} (and sometimes expressly) sexually {{experienced by the}} time they meet Bond. Quite often those previous experiences have not been positive, and many Bond girls have had sexual violence inflicted on them in the past which has caused them to feel alienated from all men—until Bond comes along. Tiffany Case was gang-raped as a teenager; Honey Ryder, too, was beaten and raped as a teenager by a drunken acquaintance. Pussy Galore was sexually abused at age 12 by her uncle. While there is no such clear-cut trauma in Solitaire's early life, there are suggestions that she, too, avoids men because of their unwanted sexual advances in her past. Kissy Suzuki reports to Bond that during her brief career in Hollywood, when she was 17, [...] "They thought that because I am Japanese I am some sort of an animal and that my body is for everyone." [...] The implication is often that these violent episodes have turned the Bond girls in question against men, though upon encountering Bond they overcome their earlier antipathy and sleep with him not only willingly but eagerly. The cliché reaches its most extreme (perhaps absurd) level in Goldfinger. In this novel Pussy Galore is portrayed as a practising lesbian when she first meets Bond, {{but at the end of}} the novel she sleeps with him. When, in bed, he <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> [...] "They told me you only liked women," [...] she replies, [...] "I never met a man before." ...|$|E

2500|$|The persuasive {{power of}} {{language}} is first alluded to by Charles, who tells Joan after she has assured him she can end {{the siege of}} Orléans, [...] "Thou hast astonished me with thy high terms" [...] (1.2.93). This sense is repeated when the Countess of Auvergne is wondering about Talbot and <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> servant, [...] "Great is the rumour of this dreadful knight,/And his achievements of no less account./Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears,/To give their censure of these rare reports" [...] (2.3.7–10). Like Charles, Auvergne has been astonished with the 'high terms' bestowed on Talbot, and now she wishes {{to see if the}} report and the reality conflate. Later in the play, the persuasive power of language becomes important for Joan, as she uses it as a subterfuge to sneak into Rouen, telling her men, [...] "Be wary how you place your words;/Talk like the vulgar sort of market men/That come to gather money for their corn" [...] (3.2.3.5). Later, she uses language to persuade Burgundy to join with the Dauphin against the English. As Burgundy realises he is succumbing to her rhetoric, he muses to himself, [...] "Either she hath bewitched me with her words,/Or nature makes me suddenly relent" [...] (3.3.58–59). Here, language is shown to be so powerful as to act on Burgundy the same way Nature itself would act, {{to the point where he}} is unsure if he has been persuaded by a natural occurrence or by Joan's words. Language is thus presented as capable of transforming ideology. As Joan finishes her speech, Burgundy again attests to the power of her language, [...] "I am vanquish'd. These haughty words of hers/Have battered me like roaring canon-shot,/And made me almost yield upon my knees" [...] (3.3.78–80). Later, something similar happens with Henry, who agrees to marry Margaret merely because of Suffolk's description of her. In a line that echoes Burgundy's, Henry queries what it is that has prompted him to agree to Suffolk's suggestion: [...] "Whether it be through force of your report,/My noble lord of Suffolk, or for that/My tender youth was never yet attaint/With any passion of inflaming love, I cannot tell" [...] (5.6.79–83). Here, again, the power of language is shown to be so strong as to be confused with a natural phenomenon.|$|E

60|$|LADY WINDERMERE. [Shaking her head.] No, I {{am talking}} very seriously. You mustn't laugh, I am quite serious.
