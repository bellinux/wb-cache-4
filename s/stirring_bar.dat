40|$|A novel {{method for}} the {{separation}} of heterogeneous catalysts from liquid-phase reactions in High Throughput Experimentation (HTE) libraries was developed based on a magnetic recuperation procedure. Separation of heterogeneous catalysts from their reaction mixture is an essential step both for catalyst regeneration and for sampling in time from a batch reactor {{with the aim of}} determining the kinetic parameters of the chosen reaction. In a conventional approach, separation is achieved through centrifugation and/or filtration steps, which are difficult to automate and to apply with HTE catalyst libraries. Magnetic separation represents an attractive alternative for HTE applications. In this work, a library of ferromagnetic zeolite catalysts was prepared by impregnation of a set of H-zeolite structures with different amounts of iron particles (Fe 3 +) followed by calcination and reduction under H 2. These magnetic zeolites can be efficiently stirred in the catalytic reaction mixture using conventional magnetic <b>stirring</b> <b>bars</b> (magnetic field of 15 - 25 mT) and they automatically separate from the reaction mixture by depositing on the magnetic <b>bar</b> when the <b>stirring</b> is stopped. In order to reach 100 % recovery using conventional magnetic <b>stirring</b> <b>bars</b> a minimum iron content of 10 wt. % is required. TEM analysis shows that the iron (Fe 0) particles have an average size of ~ 10 nm, implying that they are too large to fit inside the zeolite micropores and, therefore, are located on the exterior surface of the zeolite crystals, where the interference with the catalytic active sites is limited. For the efficient application of magnetic separation in HTE studies of libraries of catalysts, the activity of the heterogeneous catalysts should not be affected significantly by the presence of the iron particles. To investigate this, the library of 10 %Fe magnetic zeolites was tested in the acid-catalysed benzylation of toluene with benzyl alcohol and the results were compared to those obtained with the corresponding untreated zeolites. Reaction conditions were: 5 ml toluene and 1 mmol benzyl alcohol with 100 mg of catalyst, at 80 ºC. The catalytic test of the library of magnetic zeolites was performed on a HTE automated liquid-handling workstation. Separation of the catalyst from the reaction medium when stopping the magnetic stirring, followed by sampling via septum piercing and transfer to a 98 position rack, took around 17 s for each reactor. The conversions and products yields were determined by Ultra-fast GC analysis (3 min per sample). All the magnetic zeolites showed comparable but slightly lower activity than the unmodified samples. Such decrease is ascribed to the covering of some of the active Brönsted acid sites located at the external surface and/or partial blockage of the pore entrances by the iron particles. The selectivity among the mono-alkylated isomers obtained with the magnetic zeolites is analogous to that found with the unmodified materials. The highest catalytic activity was observed with an Ultrastable zeolite Y (USY), presenting large pores and an optimum combination of Brönsted site concentration and strength. Smaller pore zeolites, ZSM 5 and Mordenite, display higher selectivity towards the less bulky para-benzyltoluene, while with the USY zeolites the ortho- and the para-isomers are obtained with similar yields. In summary, a novel and efficient method for {{the separation of}} heterogeneous catalysts from liquid-phase reactions in HTE libraries was achieved through the introduction of a ferromagnetic function into the catalysts, without significantly affecting their catalytic performance. status: publishe...|$|R

A. SCOPE This method describes test procedures for determination of sulfate content of soils and waters. These results are used in determining the corrosive nature of the environment for concrete structures, as well as for other purposes. In this test method the sulfate ion is precipitated with barium chloride, in an acidic medium, to barium sulfate crystals of uniform size. The barium sulfate present in suspension is determined by a measurement of its turbidity and comparison with a known standardization curve. Color or suspended materials in large quantities may interfere with this test method. If the amount of color or suspended materials are small in comparison to the sulfate concentration, interference can be corrected by running blanks from which the barium chloride is missing. Large amounts of organic materials and silica in excess of 500 mg/L may inhibit satisfactory barium sulfate precipitation. B. APPARATUS 1. A Photometer shall be operative at 420 mm, or nephelometer.

Starting from commercially available chemicals, the IMPCSP is prepared in several steps: (i) reaction of β-CD with 1 -(p-toluenesulfonyl) -imidazole to afford mono- 6 A-(p-toluenesulfonyl) - 6 A-deoxy-β-cyclodextrin (B); (ii) nucleophilic addition between B and 1 -vinylimidazole and followed by treatment with anionic-exchange resin to give mono-vinylimidazolium-CD chloride (C); (iii) electrophilic addition between C and phenyl isocyanate to generate 6 A-(3 -vinylimidazolium) - 6 -deoxyperphenylcarbamate-β-CD chloride (D); (iv) reaction of silica gel with 3 -methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane to engender vinylized silica (E); (v) immobilization of C onto vinylized silica via radical copolymerization with 2, 3 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -butadiene in the presence of 2, 2 ’-azobis(2 -methylpropionitrile) (AIBN) to afford the desired chiral stationary phases. The overall IMPCSP preparation and column packing protocol requires ~ 2 weeks. ### Introduction Chromatographic methodologies have been extensively explored for accurate sample analyses, online monitoring of reaction progress and purifying of synthesized products (1). Especially, modern chromatographic techniques have been developed as powerful tools for chiral separation and preparation of enantiomers, most of which are of biological and pharmaceutical interests. Whatever chiral chromatographic techniques are used, chiral selectors either dissolved as mobile phases or mobilized onto supporting materials as stationary phases are crucial for successful and robust enantioseparations. Among the chiral selectors used so far, cyclodextrins (CDs) and their derivatives have been widely used in chiral chromatography since its first introduction by Armstrong et al. (2). In order to obtain a better solubility, the charged moieties are favorably introduced onto CD rims for capillary electrophoresis (CE). The self-mobility of CD in the ionized form enhances the separation ability when it is opposite to the electrophoretic mobility of the analytes (3). The hydrophobic moieties on the analytes could be included or adsorbed into the chiral cavity of CDs. Meanwhile, the analytes could also interact with the substituents on the CD rims (4, 5). The native CDs and their chemically-modified derivatives afford fine-tuned hydrophobicities, charges and cone shapes etc., which ultimately result in different tightness and interactions for CD-analytes complexes selectors and thus chemically-manipulated diving forces for chiral recognitions (6 - 14). The charged CD-based chiral mobile phases and chiral stationary phases (CSPs) have been extensively explored in drug chiral analyses (15 - 20). A sulfated β-CD based CSP was developed which enabled great enantioseparations towards 33 racemic drugs in high-perfomace liquid chromatography (HPLC) 9. Recently, ionic-liquids featured positively-charged CDs have been covalently bonded onto silica gels to prepare novel CSPs, which exhibited dual selectivity in HPLC for the enantioseparation of both polar and non-polar compounds (18). The additional electrostatic interactions are significant to achieve separations of polar analytes which may interact with the neutral CDs too weakly, where 16 aromatic alcohol racemates and 2 drugs were achieved in polar organic mobile phases 19. In our previous report, a series of coated CSPs based on fully derivatized cationic β-CD were prepared. These cationic β-CD CSPs have shown strong enantioseparation abilities and moderate retention times towards a series of α-phenyl alcohols in both supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) and HPLC 20. However, polar organic solvents in the mobile phase could cause damage to the coated CSPs. Besides, the efficiencies of the coated CSPs are usually low as the surface thickness of chiral selectors is hard to control (21). Figure- 1 (R Wang) Syntheses of Ts-CD (B), compounds C and D. The immobilization of functionalized CD onto silica gel is generally achieved by chemical reactions between highly reactive substituent on CD and the functional groups on silica gel (14, 16 - 18). Tedious synthetic approaches with possible protecting and de-protecting steps are usually required for successful grafting. Comparatively, the facile co-polymerization method is more accessible and reliable, universally employed in producing non-silica fillings for columns applicable for size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) or ion-exchange applications (22). The polymerized materials used for chromatography have wide applicable pH ranges and improved retentions for polar analytes, although lower mechanic strength and efficiency are often observed than the silica-based CSPs. The co-polymerization approach was also explored in the immobilizing of polysaccharide or enantiopure small molecules onto silica gel for the preparation of CSPs (23, 24). Figure- 2 (R Wang) Preparation of IMPCSP via radical copolymerization. In view of the our continuous and successful research endeavors in developing powerful cationic CDs as chiral selectors for both CE and HPLC (12, 25, 26), we recently developed the facile copolymerization methodology in preparing novel covalently-bonded cationic β-CD CSPs via co-polymerization approach (see Figs. 1 and 2). These as-prepared CSPs have successfully expanded the enatioseparation windows towards a broader range of chromatographic conditions for both HPLC and SFC application (27, 28). The linkage between CD selector and silica-support was built by using diene (ca. 2, 3 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -butadiene) as the third monomer for the dual copolymerization system with vinyllated CD and silica gel. The extended linkage can effectively improve the surface loading issue of CD onto silica gel, a challenge faced when direct immobilizing CD derivatives onto silica surface with short spacers due to steric hindrance (29). The as-developed CDs CSPs exhibited great potential in drug enantioseparations in both HPLC and SFC applications. The protocol describes herein the synthesis of imidazolium-based IMPCSP. This methodology can also be applied for the synthesis of other ammonium-based cationic CD CSPs (27, 28), which may find wide applications for both drug enantioseparations and NOM assessments. ### Reagents 1. β-Cyclodextrin (β-CD; > 95 %; TCI, cat. no.

The geometry of the resulting discs could be easily adjusted by the magnetic stirring time and speed, the <b>stirring</b> <b>bar</b> weight, and the amount of organic solvent. Our strategy is simple, scalable, and hardly dependent on the nature of the organic solvent and the PS sphere diameter; PS spheres with diameters ranging from 200 nm to 5 μm were deformed into discs with almost 100 % yield. When organic solutions of fluorescent dyes and nanoparticles were used instead of pure organic solvents for PS sphere liquefaction, fluorescent discs were obtained, underlining the effective, efficient encapsulation of the fluorescent substance in the discs...|$|E

30|$|The esters yields {{are higher}} than {{reported}} for the trans-esterification of RSO using methanol and NaOH as the catalyst (85  %, 6 : 1 molar ratio of methanol to oil, 1  wt% catalyst {{with respect to the}} oil, 30  °C) [14]. This suggests that the ethanolysis of RSO is faster than methanolysis, supported by other studies [24, 25]. However, literature data are conflicting and others report that the reaction with methanol is faster than with ethanol [26 – 28]. These contradictory results are likely {{due to the fact that}} the reaction is a reactive liquid-liquid system, for which the overall kinetics are not only determined by intrinsic kinetics of the reaction but also by mass transport of reactive components between the L-L interfaces. As such, differences in stirring speed, the type of impeller (simply a magnetic <b>stirring</b> <b>bar</b> or a well-designed impeller) and geometry of the reactor may play an important role. Regarding mass transfer limitations, these are expected to be less of importance for ethanol as the solubility of the plant oil in ethanol is better than in methanol [25].|$|E
