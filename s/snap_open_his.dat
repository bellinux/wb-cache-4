60|$|Quashy had a habit, {{when his}} risible faculties were only gently tickled, of {{shutting}} his eyes, throwing back his head, opening his great mouth wide, and indulging {{in a silent}} laugh. Having done so on the present occasion, he shut his mouth with a <b>snap</b> and <b>opened</b> <b>his</b> eyes.|$|R
60|$|He {{heard the}} {{trampling}} and <b>his</b> eyes <b>snapped</b> <b>open.</b> Never sleep on a strange planet, {{he told himself}} futilely.|$|R
5000|$|Intensity {{control was}} {{provided}} via a mechanical shutter (the discharge lamp being non-dimmable). A second, [...] "strobe" [...] shutter, designed to <b>snap</b> <b>open</b> and closed {{as fast as}} possible, was incorporated into the intensity mechanism.|$|R
60|$|The little window {{vanished}} with a click, another {{beside it}} <b>snapped</b> <b>open</b> and instantly closed, {{and then a}} third, {{and for a moment}} I had to close my eyes because of the blinding splendour of the waning moon.|$|R
6000|$|He <b>snapped</b> <b>open</b> {{the case}} he carried, glancing inside for a second. Then he closed it again, {{grasping}} the handle firmly. [...] "Let's go," [...] he said. He stood up slowly. [...] "You two come up beside me. I {{want to make}} sure you look the way you should." ...|$|R
50|$|The bee nests in salt-saturated soil.It is an {{effective}} pollinator for alfalfa. They are known to perform a specialized technique for opening alfalfa flowers for pollination, by which the bee applies pressure to <b>snap</b> <b>open</b> the keel of the flower. Due to the bees' unusual nesting needs, farmers have developed ways to accommodate them.|$|R

50|$|When {{the police}} arrive, {{one of the}} policemen finds the carnage in the store. Jennifer and Craig are then implicated by the injured Bill who claims they are {{responsible}} for the attack. The policemen do not listen to their protests that this is untrue. They are arrested.

50|$|Shortly {{after their}} arrival, Sara and Paul attend a {{dinner on the}} opening night of the Los Ni√±os Santos festival, leaving Hannah {{in the care of}} her nanny, Catalina. Strange occurrences begin to occur around the finca, and a {{sleeping}} Hannah is woken by the door of the dumbwaiter <b>snapping</b> <b>open.</b> Seeing her favorite stuffed toy, Hannah climbs into the dumbwaiter to retrieve it, becoming trapped.|$|R
5000|$|Although rigid {{handcuffs}} are advantageous {{when the}} arresting officer has {{to break the}} resistance of a violent individual, they are rather bulky to carry. Therefore, Hiatts developed a folding rigid handcuff they called the [...] "Ultimate" [...] handcuff. It can be folded away when carried, e.g., on a duty belt. When extracted from the holster, it <b>snaps</b> <b>open</b> to a flat profile and locks into position, becoming rigid for use.|$|R
50|$|In either case, the {{standard}} method for minimizing arc formation and preventing contact damage {{is to use}} a fast-moving switch mechanism, typically using a spring-operated tipping-point mechanism to assure quick motion of switch contacts, regardless of the speed at which the switch control is operated by the user. Movement of the switch control lever applies tension to a spring until a tipping point is reached, and the contacts suddenly <b>snap</b> <b>open</b> or closed as the spring tension is released.|$|R
5|$|Later, Doggett confronts Kersh, {{who was not}} {{implicated in}} the conspiracy. Kersh {{explains}} to Doggett that he left the evidence that helped Doggett, {{and that he had}} told Mulder to flee, but ultimately it was Scully who actually convinced Mulder to do so. Meanwhile, Scully dreams of McMahon's and Rohrer's lifeless bodies below the harbor. Suddenly, she sees McMahon's eyes <b>snap</b> <b>open.</b> Scully wakes up and the episode cuts to William's mobile; it begins to move on its own accord.|$|R
50|$|While {{under the}} will of the Queen Bee, he and his team travel to the French embassy of Justice League International. The Queen, in an attempt to raise {{positive}} public perception for her brainwashed team, sends a robot, created {{by a member of the}} Dominators to attack both teams. During the battle, Bushmaster demonstrates the ability to blend like a chameleon, use of a technological shield that can <b>snap</b> <b>open</b> in a moment and the ability to construct large weaponry in seconds.|$|R
5000|$|The {{plentiful}} inflorescences {{are long}} clusters of white flowers. The fruit is a three-lobed capsule a few millimeters long which <b>snaps</b> <b>open</b> explosively to expel the three seeds onto the soil, {{where they may}} remain in a buried seed bank for well over 200 years before sprouting. The seed is coated in a very hard outer layer that must be scarified, generally by wildfire, before it can germinate. Like most other ceanothus, this species fixes nitrogen via actinomycetes on its roots.|$|R

50|$|David is able {{to break}} free of his bonds, but by doing so he sets off a timer {{on the back of}} the device. Across the room, he finds the body that the puppet mentioned, but also finds that the man is {{actually}} alive but under paralysis. David panics and stabs his cellmate before starting to look for the key. He slices into the man's stomach and after finding the key, David unlocks the device and throws it to the ground, just as it <b>snaps</b> <b>open.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Another widely {{available}} Nalgene Outdoor product is a 650 ml (22 fl oz) [...] "All-Terrain" [...] or [...] "bike" [...] bottle. The bottle itself {{is made from}} low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and its screw top has two moving parts: a drinking nozzle that seals until <b>snapped</b> <b>open</b> by pulling on it, and a hinged Lexan dome, that when closed both snaps the nozzle closed and protects the nozzle against contamination. Unlike traditional Nalgene containers, this item can be damaged and potentially ruined by filling it with very hot water.|$|R
5000|$|Antirrhinum majus (common snapdragon; often - {{especially}} in horticulture - simply [...] "snapdragon") is {{a species of}} flowering plant belonging to the genus Antirrhinum. The plant {{was placed in the}} Plantaginaceae family following a revision its prior classical family, Scrophulariaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region, from Morocco and Portugal north to southern France, and east to Turkey and Syria. The common name [...] "snapdragon", originates from the flowers' reaction to having their throats squeezed, which causes the [...] "mouth" [...] of the flower to <b>snap</b> <b>open</b> like a dragon's mouth.|$|R
50|$|The Super Controller is an {{accessory}} for the Nintendo Entertainment System video game console. It {{was released by}} Bandai and was a plastic clip-on device {{that was supposed to}} allow the player to have a better NES playing experience. The original NES controller could be inserted inside by <b>snapping</b> <b>open</b> the back. The Super Controller still allowed the player to use the original A, B, Start, and Select buttons on the NES controller; the only difference was an arcade stick-like knob that fit over the D-pad of the original NES controller.|$|R
50|$|The {{technique}} {{consisted of}} positioning three wooden or bamboo boards, connected by rope, around {{and between the}} suspect's bare feet. The construction of the device enabled the boards to be either <b>snapped</b> <b>open</b> and closed (like {{the wings of a}} butterfly) or gradually tightened. Each time the prisoner refused to testify or confess, the rope was pulled smartly and the boards either whacked sharply at the ankles or slowly squeezed the feet ever more tightly. A similar device called the tean zu, applied exclusively to women, employed essentially identical mechanics to squeeze and crush the finger-bones.|$|R
5000|$|To {{start the}} engine, the {{regulator}} valve V was opened and steam admitted into the cylinder from the boiler, filling the space beneath the piston. The regulator valve was then {{closed and the}} water injection valve V briefly <b>snapped</b> <b>open</b> and shut, sending a spray of cold water into the cylinder. This condensed the steam and created a partial vacuum under the piston. Pressure differential between the atmosphere above the piston and the partial vacuum below then drove the piston down making the power stroke, bringing the beam [...] "into the house" [...] and raising the pump gear.|$|R

5000|$|The Quick Dump Valve is {{a recent}} {{addition}} to the choices of valves for spudding. A QDV is a spool valve that is balanced under pressure with {{one end of the}} spool oriented toward the barrel. The spool is manually unbalanced allowing pressure between the end of the spool and the projectile in the barrel. The air pressure then forces the spool back and the projectile forward. Since the valve is triggered with no pilot pressure, the valve <b>snaps</b> <b>open</b> with no pilot pressure to hinder it. Currently it is not commercially for sale and must be hand built by the hobbyist like most piston valves.|$|R
50|$|The first Snappy Snaps {{one hour}} photo store opened in 1983. A further three trial stores were added during the {{following}} three years and, following {{the success of these}} stores, the first franchised Snappy <b>Snaps</b> store <b>opened</b> for business in 1987.|$|R

50|$|In his {{autobiography}} The Moon's A Balloon (1972), Academy Award-winning actor David Niven described a trip from New York to Florida {{in the late}} 1930s, during which he decided {{to spend the night}} at the Jefferson Hotel. Niven said that, as he was signing the guest registry in the lobby, <b>his</b> eyes <b>snapped</b> <b>open</b> with amazement when he noticed a full-sized alligator swimming in a small pool located six feet from the reception desk. The alligators at the Jefferson became world famous. Old Pompey, the last alligator living in the marble pools of the Jefferson's Palm Court, survived until 1948. Bronze statues of the alligators now decorate the hotel. Its restaurant, Lemaire, has a theme of alligator motifs.|$|R

2500|$|Early work of Kerim Seiler is {{characterized}} by two-dimensional, life-size paintings of ordinary city objects, such as park benches and ticket machines. He diversified into larger works, such as colorful and inflatable molecule sculptures, a 250-meter-long permanent neon light installation at Z√ºrich's central train station and his vaguely habitable brick structure Gulliver in Pfungen (2009). Appearing to maintain a classical view of harmony, Seiler has said that space and structure are key elements in his work.

5000|$|Heart murmurs (or cardiac murmurs) are audible noises {{through a}} stethoscope, {{generated}} by a turbulent flow of blood. Heart murmurs need to be distinguished from heart sounds which are primarily generated by the beating heart and the heart valves <b>snapping</b> <b>open</b> and shut. Generally, heart murmurs are classified as innocent (also called physiological or functional) or pathological (abnormal). Innocent murmurs are usually harmless, often caused by physiological conditions outside the heart, {{and the result of}} certain benign structural defects. Pathological murmurs are most often associated with heart valve problems but may also be caused by a wide array of structural heart defects.Various characteristics constitute a qualitative description of heart murmurs, including timing (systolic murmur and diastolic murmur), shape, location, radiation, intensity, pitch and quality.CAA systems typically categorize heart sounds and murmurs as Class I and Class III according to the American Heart Association: ...|$|R
