Results: Of the 2, 220 patient records examined, 66 patients developed <b>seizure.</b> <b>Seizure</b> was more common in men (33 patients), and most common in the 15 - 40 year age group (28 patients). The most common causes of seizure were tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) (39. 7 %), organophosphates (17. 5 %), carbamazepine (7. 9 %) and organochlorines (6. 3 %). However, status epilepticus was more common in organochlorine (25 %), organophosphate, TCA (18. 75 %), and carbamazepine (12. 5 %) poisoning. There was a negative relationship between age and type of seizures. Seizure was not related to previous history of seizure. Midazolam alone (25 %) was the most effective drug for controlling seizures. Death occurred in six patients with or without renal complication. The mortality rate among poisoned patients with seizure was 37. 5 %. Conclusion: The incidence of seizure in our study reflects the availability of certain drugs and toxins that require more steadfast control.

Though there are effective medications available to reduce the symptoms of the disease, their side effects have limited their usage. Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) has been shown to attenuate seizure in different animal models. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the role of CB 1 and CB 2 receptors in this attenuation. Male wistar rats were used for the current experiment. PTZ was injected to induce chemical kindling in animals. After verification of kindling in animals, treatment was performed with PEA, AM 251 and AM 630 in different groups. Latency to induce <b>seizure,</b> <b>seizure</b> stages and latency and duration of fifth stage of seizure was recorded for each animal. Injection of PTZ led to seizure in the animals. Pretreatment with PEA increased the latency to initiate seizures and reduced the duration of seizure. Pretreatment with different dosages of AM 251 had contrary effects so that at lower doses they increased the seizure in animals but at higher doses led to the attenuation of seizure. AM 630 increased seizures in a dose dependent manner. Combination of the antagonists increased the seizure parameters and attenuated the effect of PEA on seizure. PEA attenuated the PTZ-induced seizures and pretreatment with CB 1 and CB 2 antagonists diminished this effect of PEA, but still PEA was effective, which might be attributed to the contribution of other receptors in PEA anti-epileptic properties.

The proposed algorithm incorporates an automatic channel selection (ACS) engine as a pre-processing stage to the seizure detection procedure. The ACS engine consists of supervised classifiers which aim to find iEEG channels which contribute the most to a <b>seizure.</b> <b>Seizure</b> detection stage involves feature extraction and classification. Feature extraction is performed in both frequency and time domains where spectral power and correlation between channel pairs are calculated.

The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of abnormal neuroimaging and related factors in children with the first unprovoked seizure. Materials & MethodsA 7 -year retrospective chart review was done on all children who were visited at Ali-Asghar Children’s Hospital with the first unprovoked seizure and underwent neuroimaging including brain computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The diagnostic criteria for the first unprovoked seizure in this study werebased on the absence of any immediate or acute cause for the first seizure such as fever, head trauma, hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, electrolyte imbalance and etc. We compared the rate of abnormal neuroimaging in patients according to different clinical and electroencephalographic (EEG) parameters. ResultsOne hundred and forty two patients (63 females, 79 males) were included in the study. Twenty eight patients (20 %) had abnormal neuroimaging. CT scan and MRI were done in 63 % and 37 % of the patients, respectively. The most common abnormalities were cerebral dysgenesis (n= 9) and cortical brain atrophy (n= 6).

40|$|Abstract Background The Belgian {{shepherd}} Groenendael and Tervueren {{is believed}} to be at higher risk of developing epilepsy than dogs of the common population. This epidemiological study was designed to estimate the prevalence of epilepsy in the Danish population of Groenendael and Tervueren born between 1995 and 2004. Furthermore, it was the intention to describe the clinical manifestation (seizure types and phenomenology) of epilepsy and to identify risk factors for euthanasia once the dog was diagnosed as having epilepsy. Methods All owners of Groenendael and Tervueren dogs born between January 1995 and December 2004 and registered in the Danish Kennel Club (1, 248 dogs) were contacted and asked to answer a mailed questionnaire concerning epilepsy. Positive responders were subsequently validated in a follow-up interview conducted by telephone using a standardized questionnaire. Owners were questioned about age at first <b>seizure,</b> <b>seizure</b> frequency, seizure duration, a detailed description of seizure phenomenology, post-ictal signs and if a veterinarian had diagnosed the dog with epilepsy. Results Prevalence of epilepsy was estimated at 9. 5 %. Mean age of epilepsy debut was 3. 3 years (range 0. 5 – 8. 0 years). There was an almost equal number of Groenendael (25) and Tervueren (24). The distribution of females and males was 31 and 18 respectively. Twenty-five per cent experienced focal seizures, 53 % experienced focal seizures with secondary generalization and 18 % experienced primary generalized seizures. In four percent seizures were unclassifiable. The most commonly reported focal seizure phenomenology included ataxia, crawling, swaying, fearful behavior, salivation, excessive attention seeking and disorientation. In 16 % of the cases, epilepsy led to euthanasia. Intact dogs with epilepsy had a significantly increased risk of being euthanized because of epilepsy compared to neutered dogs with epilepsy. In 22 % of the cases the owners reported that anxiety/hyperactivity/stress could act as a seizure provoking factor. Conclusion A high prevalence of epilepsy appears to be present in the Danish Groenendael and Tervueren population. The relatively late debut age of epilepsy in this breed contributes greatly to the increased prevalence of epileptic individuals, because dogs developing epilepsy late in life are used for breeding unintended. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The primary aim of {{our study}} was to compare the {{health-related}} quality of life (HRQL) of children with epilepsy in Hong Kong with that of children with epilepsy in Canada, and to explore possible factors affecting these findings. A second interest was to determine agreement between proxy reports and self-ratings among children with epilepsy in Hong Kong, compare these with findings in Canada, and identify factors that influence the concordance. Methods: Child self-report and parent-proxy questionnaires on an epilepsy-specific HRQL measure, appropriately translated and validated in Chinese, were administered to 266 Hong Kong children and their parents. An unpaired t {{test was used to}} compare the scores with published results from 381 Canadian children and their parents, who used the original English version of the measure. Demographic characteristics of the two groups were compared using t tests, χ 2 tests, and Fisher’s exact tests. Agreement between parents’ and children’s scores was evaluated with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and standardized response means (SRMs). The total HRQL score differences between parents and children in Hong Kong were compared with those in Canada using an unpaired t test. Factors that might affect the parent–child score difference were studied using Pearson correlation analysis, χ 2 test, and analysis of variance. Factors studied included: sex, current age, age at diagnosis, duration of epilepsy, number of antiepileptic drugs used, type of <b>seizure,</b> <b>seizure</b> severity, cognition of the child, the type of school attended, presence of neurological problems, presence of behavioral problems, recent health care usage, education and employment status of both parents, housing status of the family, and relationship of the proxy respondent to the child. Results: (1) In contrast to the Canadian sample, Hong Kong children with epilepsy were older (P 3 ̆c 0. 01), had a longer duration of epilepsy (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) and less severe seizures (P 3 ̆c 0. 01), and were more likely to attend normal schools (P 3 ̆c 0. 01). Children in Hong Kong reported more interpersonal/social difficulties (P 3 ̆c 0. 01), more worries (P 3 ̆c 0. 01), and more secrecy about their epilepsy (P 3 ̆c 0. 01). Parents in Hong Kong believed that their children perceived more worries (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) and were more secretive about their epilepsy (P 3 ̆c 0. 01). (2) Moderate to good agreement between parent-proxy response scores and child self-report scores was demonstrated (ICC = 0. 50 – 0. 69, SRM = 0. 19 – 0. 33). The total HRQL score differences between parent and child in Hong Kong were not different from those in Canada. None of the factors studied were related to the parent–child score difference. Conclusions: Youth with epilepsy in Hong Kong and their parents reported poorer quality of life than children with epilepsy in Canada. Further studies are necessary to identify the determinants of HRQL in children with epilepsy in different cultures. Acceptable agreement between the two ratings suggests that proxy reports can be used when child self-reports cannot be obtained...|$|E
40|$|Eclampsia {{is defined}} as de novo seizure in a woman with the {{hypertensive}} complication of pregnancy known as preeclampsia (PE), and is {{a leading cause of}} maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality worldwide. The pathogenesis of eclamptic seizure remains unknown, but is considered a form of hypertensive encephalopathy where an acute rise in blood pressure causes loss of cerebral blood flow (CBF) autoregulation and hyperperfusion of the brain that results in vasogenic edema formation and subsequent seizure. However, eclamptic seizure can occur during seemingly uncomplicated pregnancies, in the absence of hypertension and PE, suggesting that normal pregnancy may predispose the brain to hypertensive encephalopathy or seizure, independently of PE. The overall goal of this dissertation was to investigate the effect of pregnancy and PE on the cerebrovasculature and neurophysiological properties that may promote brain injury and eclamptic seizure. For this dissertation project, a rat model of PE was established that combined placental ischemia, induced by restricting blood flow to the uteroplacental unit, and maternal endothelial dysfunction that was induced by a prolonged high cholesterol diet. Rats with PE developed several PE-like symptoms, including elevated blood pressure, fetal growth restriction, placental dysfunction, and were in a state of oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. We found that pregnancy had an overall protective effect on the maintenance of CBF that was potentially due to a nitric-oxide dependent enhancement of the vasodilation of cerebral arteries to decreased intravascular pressure. Further, maintenance of CBF during acute hypertension was similar in pregnancy and PE. Thus, it does not appear that pregnancy and PE are states during which CBF autoregulation is compromised in a manner that would promote the development of hypertensive encephalopathy. However, the brain was found to be in a hyperexcitable state during normal pregnancy that was augmented in PE, and could contribute to onset of eclamptic seizure. Under chloral hydrate anesthesia, generalized seizure was induced by timed infusion of the convulsant pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), with simultaneous electroencephalography that was stopped at the first onset of spikewave discharge indicative of electrical <b>seizure.</b> <b>Seizure</b> threshold was determined as the amount of PTZ required to elicit seizure. Compared to the nonpregnant state, seizure threshold was ~ 44 % lower in pregnant rats and ~ 80 % lower in rats with PE. Further, pregnant rats were more susceptible to seizure-induced vasogenic edema formation than the nonpregnant state. Mechanisms by which pregnancy and PE lowered seizure threshold appeared to be through pregnancy-associated decreases in cortical gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABAAR) subunits and PE-induced disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and microglial activation, indicative of neuroinflammation. Magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4), the leading treatment for seizure prophylaxis in women with PE, restored seizure threshold to control levels by reversing neuroinflammation in PE rats, without affecting BBB permeability. Overall, this dissertation provides evidence that pregnancy increases susceptibility of the brain to seizure and vasogenic edema formation that likely contribute to the onset of eclampsia during seemingly uncomplicated pregnancies. Further, the pathogenesis of eclampsia during PE likely involves breakdown of the BBB and subsequent neuroinflammation, resulting in a state of greater seizure susceptibility that is ameliorated by MgSO 4 treatment...|$|E
