5000|$|Manila Water, on {{the other}} hand, {{initially}} did not invest in system expansion in its Eastern Zone. It focused on reducing non-revenue water and initially borrowed only small amounts in local currency. It bid out works competitively and gained the trust of former MWSS employees who were trained in relevant fields. Only a few top positions were filled with outsiders seconded from its mother company Ayala or its foreign partners. Manila Water used a [...] "territory management" [...] approach to reduce non-revenue water, under which decentralized operating units were responsible for decisions about appropriate actions. <b>Staff</b> <b>evaluation</b> and compensation were linked to their performance. [...] Despite its successful management Manila Water's concession could not survive based on the extremely low tariffs it had committed itself to charge. As early as 1998 Manila Water requested an increase of the 5.2 percent rate of return it had included in its own bid to calculate its tariff. The MWSS Regulatory Office refused to grant the increase. Manila Water then seized an international arbitration panel. The panel granted an increase to 9.3 percent, {{which resulted in a}} substantial tariff increase. Civil society groups criticized the decision, saying it undermined the integrity of the original bid at the expense of customers and competitors. Manila Water made a profit as early as 1999, gained the confidence of banks and could gradually increase its borrowing.|$|E
