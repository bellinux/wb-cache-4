40|$|The natural {{initiation}} {{and growth}} of short cracks in Inconel® 718 U-notch specimens has been studied at 600 °C in air. <b>U</b> <b>notches</b> were introduced through broaching, and hardness traces and optical microscopy on cross-sections through the <b>U</b> <b>notch</b> broaching showed that the broaching process had introduced a deformed, work hardened layer. Fatigue tests were conducted under load control using a 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 trapezoidal waveform, on specimens with as-broached and polished U-notches. Multi-site crack initiation occurred in the notch root. Many of the cracks initiated at bulge-like features formed by volume expansion of oxidising (Nb,Ti) C particles. In unstressed samples, oxidation of (Nb,Ti) C particles occurred readily, producing characteristic surface eruptions. Scanning electron microscopy on metallographic sections revealed some sub-surface (Nb,Ti) C oxidation and localised matrix deformation around oxidised particles. A mechanism for crack initiation by carbide expansion during oxidation is discussed. Surface short crack growth rates in the notch root of polished specimens were measured using an acetate replica technique. Observed short-crack growth rates were approximately constant across {{a wide range of}} crack lengths. However, there was a transition to rapid, accelerating crack growth once cracks reached several hundred micrometers in length. This rapid propagation in the latter stages of the fatigue life was assisted by crack coalescence. Polishing the U-notch to remove broaching marks resulted in a pronounced increase in fatigue life...|$|R

Depending on the quench rate, the ultimate tensile strength (UTS), 0. 2 % proof stress (PS), percentage of elongation and Charpy <b>U</b> <b>notch</b> impact energy values of the steel in the as cast condition after heat treatment varied at ranges of 1550 - 1560 MPa, 1500 - 1520 MPa, 8 - 12. 5 % and 370 - 790 kJ m 22 respectively. The microstructure of the 0. 3 C-CrMoV steel is reported to consist of martensite and bainite.

Interestingly, the percentage of elongation also increased to 14 % simultaneously with UTS and PS without any drop in the Charpy <b>U</b> <b>notch</b> impact energy. The improvement in the mechanical properties of the steel with increasing chromium content may be attributed to an increase in the volume fraction of the martensite in the mixed martensite and bainite microstructure...|$|R

40|$|In {{reference}} to the crack deflection ability of multi-layered keratin and the fibers reinforcement of the dorsal cortex in the turtle shell carapace, a bio-inspired composite of Ti-intermetallic multi-layered/SiCf-reinforced Ti matrix was successfully fabricated through vacuum hot-pressing sintering using pure titanium foils, pure aluminum foils and continuous SiC ceramic fibers. Our observation reveals that Ti-intermetallic multi-layers were well bonded to each other {{with the formation of}} in situ Ti 3 Al, TiAl, TiAl 2 and TiAl 3 phases between Ti layers. At the same time, SiC fibers were firmly bonded to the Ti matrix through a circular joining of TiC achieved by the reaction between the deposited coating of C and the Ti matrix. Due to the strengthen effect of continuous-SiCf-reinforced Ti-matrix part, the tensile and the flexural strengths of the hybrid composite along the longitudinal direction of the fibers were about 636 +/- 40 and 889 +/- 50 MPa (Ti-intermetallic multi-layered part stressed in tension) or 984 +/- 50 MPa (continuous-SiCf-reinforced Ti-matrix part stressed in tension), respectively. These values were much higher than those obtained from Ti-intermetallic multi-layered composite, corresponding to 404 +/- 30 and 462 +/- 30 MPa. In addition, the Ti-intermetallic multi-layered composite showed higher fracture toughness value (34. 7 +/- 1. 2 MPa m(1 / 2)) than that of continuous-SiCf-reinforced Ti-matrix composite (24. 8 +/- 0. 1 MPa m(1 / 2)). In drop hammer impact test, the hybrid composite exhibited better crack resistance and higher absorb energy when the <b>U</b> <b>notch</b> was in Ti-intermetallic multi-layered side, other than <b>U</b> <b>notch</b> in continuous-SiCf-reinforced Ti-matrix part.

The samples were loaded by means of an instrumented impact pendulum. The evaluation and classification of different fracture behaviour modes have been based on evaluation of load – flexure traces supported by fractographic analysis.

The surface hardening showed the minimal negative effect on crack initiation and relatively small fracture resistance decrease...|$|R

Beyond these obstacles, they crested the southeast ridge, and climbed a series of granite blocks to the summit.|$|R

Stress distribution {{in the vicinity of}} the <b>U</b> <b>notch</b> has been obtained, as well as numeric solutions of K for crack front geometries with rectilinear, corner and unconventional crack front shapes.

Additionally, a stress triaxility parameter was used in order to confirm the stress state condition in the crack propagation region. The conclusions of this study are encouraging concerning the possibility of using ZENCRACK® as an advantageous computational tool for obtaining K solutions in the case of particular crack front geometries as obtained from fatigue experimental testing...|$|R

FP in UN have shown to be preferably accommodated at U vacancies in bound [100]-Schottky defects, nevertheless, similar incorporation energies were found at a <b>single</b> <b>U</b> vacancy. From the investigated incorporation and migration mechanism, we found that fission products in UN predominately migrate along U-U vacancies, since the incorporation energies for all FP are lowest at <b>single</b> <b>U</b> vacancy or at the U vacancy in a Schottky defect. The energy required to induce a migration of a volatile FP from an N vacancy to U vacancy is about 4 – 5. 5 eV. The local volume changes caused by the fission-product substitution have been assessed by means of DFT and combined with the fission-product concentrations obtained by means of neutron calculations (SCALE) to predict fission product swelling in UN. The linear swelling of nitride fuel resulting from these calculations, and the assumption that fission products do not interact and form secondary phases, leads to a reasonable estimation for the swelling rate {{as a function of}} burn-up (or time) when compared with empirical correlations in the open literature.

The mathematic model based on physical equations for the valve is also established in Matlab Simulink, the dynamic responses are analyzed for the valve with three different notch types separately. The results show that the minimum pressure positions in flow fields are on the valve body near the notches. The value of the minimum pressure with K notches is the highest among three kind notch types. The minimum pressures will decrease greatly along with the flow rate increased. The efflux angles for the valve with three kind notch types separately are different, so are the steady flow forces. The valve with V notches responses quickest, but the ram moves quickest with <b>U</b> <b>notch</b> valve.
