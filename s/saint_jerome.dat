5|$|Christians in late antiquity might insert Hebrew into Greek exorcisms. <b>Saint</b> <b>Jerome</b> reports an odd {{story about}} a Frankish-Latin bilingual man of the Candidati Imperial {{bodyguard}} who, {{in a state of}} demonic possession, began speaking perfect Aramaic, a language he did not know.|$|E
5|$|The {{octagonal}} font {{dates from}} the 15th century; its carved panels alternate images of the symbols of the Four Evangelists with seated figures of the Doctors of the Church (Saint Ambrose, Saint Augustine, <b>Saint</b> <b>Jerome,</b> and Pope Gregory I). The central column carries shields depicting the Instruments of the Passion and the Holy Wounds. The eastern shield is unusual in that a sword is shown with an ear stuck to it. This refers {{to the story of}} Saint Peter striking off the ear of Malchus, the High Priest's servant, in the garden of Gethsemane.|$|E
5|$|Æthelbald lived until 757 {{and carried}} Mercian {{power to a}} new height. His debt to Crowland was not forgotten: soon after his {{accession}} he richly endowed a new church on the site where Guthlac had lived as a hermit. The first Life of Guthlac, written by the monk Felix, appeared soon after Guthlac's death. Nothing is known about Felix, although Bertram Colgrave has observed {{that he was a}} good scholar who evidently had access to works by Bede and Aldhelm, to a Life of Saint Fursey and Latin works by <b>Saint</b> <b>Jerome,</b> Saint Athanasius and Gregory the Great. Felix was either an East Anglian or was living in the kingdom when he wrote the book, which was written at the request of Ælfwald. In the Life, Felix portrays Æthelbald's exile at Crowland and asserts Ælfwald's right to rule in East Anglia. Two Old English verse versions of the Life drawn on the work of Felix were written, which show the vigour of vernacular heroic and elegiac modes in Ælfwald's kingdom.|$|E

The splays {{on each side of}} the portal are filled with statues, among them are statues of King Manuel I and Queen Maria of Aragón kneeling in a niche under a lavishly decorated baldachin, flanked by their patrons: <b>Saint</b> <b>Jerome</b> and Saint John the Baptist, respectively. The supporting corbels are decorated with little angels holding the coat-of-arms and, at the side of the king, an armillary sphere and, at the side of the queen, three blooming twigs. Renaissance elements include angels in Roman garb, cherubs, the detail and realism of the kings and the nude study of <b>Saint</b> <b>Jerome.</b>|$|E

25|$|Melencolia I is a 1514 {{engraving}} by the German Renaissance master Albrecht Dürer. It is an allegorical composition {{which has}} been the subject of many interpretations.

25|$|Two ancient testimonies exist {{about the}} mission of Saint Bartholomew in India. These are of Eusebius of Caesarea (early 4th century) and of <b>Saint</b> <b>Jerome</b> (late 4th century).

The origin of the name {{is a source of}} controversy with historians, some writing that it was appeals by the soldiers to <b>Saint</b> <b>Jerome</b> ("Jeronimo!") for help. Others source it as the mispronunciation of his name by the Mexican soldiers.|$|E
