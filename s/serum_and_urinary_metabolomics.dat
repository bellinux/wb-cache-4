However, <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) activities did not change after renal ischemia in the dogs that had received hypothermic renal perfusion or in those that had not. Histologically, severe degenerative changes of the renal parenchyma were observed in dogs when ischemia was prolonged long without hypothermic renal perfusion. 2) Thirty-six patients with renal calculi had nephrotomy. In situ hypothermic renal perfusion was performed in 9 of the cases and it was not used in the other cases. <b>Serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> enzyme activities were studied in these two groups of patients following renal ischemia.

40|$|Background: The {{severity}} of ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) kidney injury is {{highly correlated with}} mortality and morbidity rate. Research on human and animal prove that NGAL predicts kidney injury at early phase. The objective {{of this study is}} to prove that the increase in <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> NGAL are correlated with kidney tubular epithelial damage, and this increase has occurred in initiation phase, indicated by rat kidney histopathology in an early I/R model. Methods: Twenty eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups: 4 hour sham (Sham 4), 8 hour sham (Sham 8), 10 minute ischemia 4 hour reperfusion (I/R 4) and 10 minute ischemia 8 hour reperfusion (I/R 8). Blood, urine and kidney samples were collected. Serum creatinine level was analyzed with Jaffe method, while <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> NGAL level were analyzed with direct sandwich ELISA method. Evaluation of kidney damage were measured semi quantitatively in tissue stained with HE. Further evaluation to confirm cellular changes on kidney was performed by electron microscope <b>and</b> immunohistochemistry. Results: <b>Serum</b> NGAL was found significantly correlated with degree of kidney tissue damage (ρSpearman NGAL serum = 0. 701, p < 0. 001), also urinary NGAL (ρSpearman = 0. 689, p < 0. 001). NGAL expression differs significantly between I/R group and sham (t-test, t = - 26635. 056, p < 0. 001), also kidney damage (t-test, t = - 5. 028, p < 0. 001), <b>and</b> <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> NGAL levels (Mann-Whitney, U = 0, p < 0. 001).

Aim: To measure <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> AGEs in non-diabetic volunteers and relate their concentration to body composition, blood chemistry and dietary ingestión. Methods: We studied 41 adult men (31 middle-aged adults and 10 elderly). A nutritional assessment including a dietary recall designed for detection of AGE ingestión (specifically carboxymethyl-lysine(CML)), and anthropometric measurements were performed. Also serum lipoproteins, insulin, glucose, leptin and C reactive protein (CRP).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cushing's {{syndrome}} {{is associated with}} an increased cardiovascular risk. Although a series of cardiovascular risk factors have been identified, sulfur amino acids (SAAs), recently indicated as independent cardiovascular risk factors, have been poorly investigated in patients with Cushing's syndrome. AIM: The aim of this cross-sectional controlled study was to evaluate <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> levels <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> excretion rate (ER) of SAAs in patients with Cushing's disease (CD) during the active disease and after long-term disease remission. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Forty patients with CD (20 with active disease and 20 with cured disease for at least 5 yr) and 40 controls entered the study. <b>Serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> concentrations <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> ER of SAAs, namely methionine, cystine, homocysteine, and taurine, were measured by means of cationic exchange HPLC. <b>Serum</b> folic acid <b>and</b> vitamin B 12 levels were also evaluated in patients and controls and correlated to SAA levels. RESULTS: CD patients with active disease had higher <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> concentrations of cystine and homocysteine, <b>and</b> lower <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> higher <b>urinary</b> concentrations <b>and</b> ER of taurine than cured patients and controls. Vitamin B 12 levels were significantly decreased in patients with active disease compared with cured patients and controls, whereas folic acid levels were slightly decreased in patients than in controls. In patients with active CD, urinary cortisol concentrations were significantly and inversely correlated to <b>serum</b> taurine <b>and</b> directly correlated to taurine <b>urinary</b> ER, <b>and</b> fasting <b>serum</b> glucose levels were significantly correlated to taurine urinary ER. At the multiple regression analysis, urinary cortisol concentrations were the best predictors of taurine ER. CONCLUSIONS: CD is associated with hyperhomocysteinemia and hypotaurinemia.

Twenty patients with CD (10 active and 10 cured) and 20 sex- and age-matched healthy controls entered the study. Measurement of <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> levels of the complete series of natural amino acids was performed in all patients analyzed by cationic exchange high performance liquid cromatography (HPLC) after 2 weeks of a standardized protein intake regimen. The renal clearance (renal excretion rate) of each amino acid was calculated {{on the basis of}} the <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> concentrations of creatinine and the specific amino acid. Fasting glucose and insulin levels, glucose and insulin response to standard glucose load, insulinogenic and homeostasis model insulin resistance (Homa-R) indexes were also evaluated and correlated to the circulating levels and renal clearances of each amino acid. Significantly higher serum (p< 0. 01) <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> (p< 0. 05) levels of alanine <b>and</b> cystine, lower <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> higher <b>urinary</b> levels of leucine, isoleucine and valine (p< 0. 05) and higher renal excretion rates of leucine, isoleucine and valine (p< 0. 01) were found in patients with active CD than in patients cured from the disease and in controls. No difference was found between cured patients and controls. Creatinine clearance was similar in active and cured patients and in controls. In patients with active CD, urinary cortisol levels were significantly correlated to urinary cystine levels (r= 0. 85; p< 0. 01) and renal excretion rate of leucine (r=- 0. 76; p< 0. 05), isoleucine (r=- 0. 76; p< 0. 05) and valine (r=- 0. 66; p< 0. 05).

40|$|Introduction: The {{accomplished}} {{studies show}} that stress can cause changes in biochemical and physiological parameters in healthy people. Materials & Methods: The present study was a cross sectional study conducted on 50 healthy university students selected randomly. <b>Serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> free cortisol was measured by immunoassay a month (control) before the examinations. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 11. 5. The significance of differences was considered P< 0. 05. Findings: The average of systolic blood diastolic blood pressures {{in the control group}} were 110. 70 ± 9. 25 (mmHg), 73 ± 8. 97 (mmHg), respectively, while in the case group, 30 minutes prior to the examinations, they were 120. 20 ± 11. 29 (mmHg), and 77. 6 ± 8. 76 (mmHg), but immediately after the exams 108. 80 ± 9. 97 (mmHg), 73. 2 ± 6. 39 (mmHg). There was a statistical significance between the three groups. Also the average of <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> cortisol concentrations in the control group was 151. 83 ± 48. 86 (), 133. 03 ± 47. 1 (), 30 minutes prior to examination 201. 13 ± 62. 46 (), 175. 10 ± 44. 99 () and immediately after the examinations 141. 48 ± 49. 25 (), 165. 98 ± 46. 08 () respectively. There was also a statistical significance among the three groups. Discussion &Conclusion: Examination is a potent stressor in students. It causes biochemical and physiological changes such as enhancement of blood pressure, <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> cortisol...|$|R
40|$|Two {{hydroxyl}} containing dithiocarbamates, sodium N-methyl-D-glucamine dithiocarbamate (NaG) {{and sodium}} dihydroxyethyl dithiocarbamate (NaY) {{have been examined}} as agents for {{the control of the}} renal dysfunction in rats given cisplatin. Of these, NaG was found to be the more effective in controlling such renal dysfunction when administered at 1 and 3 h after 5 mg cisplatin kg- 1, i. p. Renal function was examined 5 days after the administration of cisplatin by measurement of <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> levels of creatinine and urea, creatinine clearance, <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> levels of Na+, K+, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, as well as the concentrations of these ions in the renal medulla and cortex. Treatment of rats given cisplatin with NaG at 1 and 3 h post cisplatin resulted in indices of renal function which were not significantly different from those of animals which had received no cisplatin. The sole difference was found to be a slight increase in renal cortical Na+ concentration...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to learn changes, which occur in <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> {{electrolytes}} after cardiopulmonary bypass. Twenty-three patients were studied, of which 14 had VSD, 5 ASD and one each T/F, PS+ASD, Ebstein malformation and MS. They were classfied into two group : one group was perfused for sixty minutes or more; the other for less than sixty minutes. <b>Serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> electrolytes were measured after cardiopulmonary bypass from time to time. All patients were perfused with 2, 000 ml of priming solution in which homologous heparinized blood was diluted to be 20 percent with buffered lactate Ringer's solution. Tris buffer was added to the solution (400 mg/ 500 ml of blood) to prevent metabolic acidosis. The body temperature of all patients except the 5 with ASD was lowered by a heat exchanger to 25 ℃ and rewarmed to 33 - 34 ℃ after completion of the intracardiac repair...|$|R
40|$|Neopterin is a pyrazino-pyrimidine compound, and {{is known}} to be a marker {{associated}} with cell-mediated immunity in various diseases. We hypothesized that the levels of <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> urine neopterin would be elevated in renal disease, and would correlate with certain clinical parameters. We evaluated <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> neopterin levels in patients with several renal diseases, including nephrotic syndrome (NS, n= 19), chronic renal failure (CRF, n= 8), end stage renal disease (ESRD, n= 64) and controls (n= 22). Serum neopterin was elevated in patients with CRF and ESRD, as compared to controls. Urinary neopterin levels were also found to be elevated in patients with CRF and ESRD, as compared to controls. Serum neopterin levels showed significant positive correlation with age, <b>serum</b> BUN <b>and</b> creatinine levels, and inverse correlation with WBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit, <b>serum</b> albumin <b>and</b> total iron binding capacity. Urine neopterin levels exhibited positive correlation with age <b>and</b> <b>serum</b> creatinine levels, <b>and</b> inverse correlation with WBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit, BUN <b>and</b> <b>serum</b> albumin. In conclusion, increased <b>serum</b> <b>and</b> <b>urinary</b> neopterin levels were found in some patients with renal disease and were correlated with certain clinical parameters...|$|R
