40|$|The {{construction}} of a compacted mineral barrier for covering a wide MSW landfill involves many relevant problems. As the wastes underlying the barrier are often very compressible, a specific degree of compaction {{may be difficult to}} achieve. Furthermore, climate conditions have a great influence on the actual compaction energy and water content of clayey liner and then on its hydraulic conductivity. This study shows the results of an experimental investigation, carried out on a full-scale landfill liner. The soil liner was first compacted by a heavy dumper, the effective degree of compaction was checked by in situ density measurements, and permeability tests were then carried out with Guelph and Boutwell permeameters, in order to validate data from previous laboratory tests and to verify whether regulations for compaction degree and barrier hydraulic conductivity had been respected. The test site is located at Grumolo delle Abbadesse (province of Vicenza, NE Italy). One of the functions of a permanent cover system for MSW landfill is to control the percolate production, to limit the infiltration of meteoric water. In these conditions, the key parameter controlling the efficiency of the mineral barrier is the coefficient of hydraulic conductivity. This coefficient can be determined by laboratory or/and on site permeability testing. The on site tests provide a value of permeability more realistic than one evaluated by laboratory tests, since greater volumes of soil are involved and therefore the important effects of soil macrostructure are also taken into account. The rollers used to compact cohesive soils are generally heavy <b>sheep</b> <b>foot</b> <b>rollers</b> with <b>feet</b> capable of penetrating the layer properly, to produce a kneading type of compaction. The choice of type of roller depends {{on the nature of the}} soil, on the availability and requirements of each site. The site operators have a powerful dumper, used on the site for other purposes, which was tested as a compaction vehicle, as its rear compartment has been loaded with different weights. Crucial aspects turned out to be not only the type of soil, but also how it had been prepared before compaction (choice of water content and clod size) which influenced the value of the coefficient of hydraulic conductivity. Using both types of in situ permeameter turns out to be essential: the Guelph instrument can be used to check the quality of compaction in a relatively short period of time during compaction and to intervene during preparation of the clay cover; testing with the Boutwell permeameter takes longer, but the final result is a coefficient which is reliable and can be used as a test parameter of the barrier. The initial results of compaction operations showed that the dumper could provide adequate compaction energy, changing the weight of the load on the rear compartment. Overall, the test results also highlighted the important aspect of driver training. The workers were familiar with the dumper, and quickly acquired the expertise to use it in this new way, as shown by the good spatial homogeneity of the characteristics of the final barrier...|$|R

40|$|Key words: {{continuous}} casting; round bloom; minimum mould exit {{shell thickness}}; <b>foot</b> <b>roller</b> designing Abstract: The minimum mould exit shell thickness (MEST) {{is one of}} key factors to consider for continuous casting machine design. Based on the shell strength at elevated temperatures, a concept of shell integral average strength, from its very top surface to the solidus frontier, has been introduced to judge its bulging tendency under ferrostatic pressure. Considering the contribution for the <b>foot</b> <b>roller</b> designing, a mathematic model for {{the determination of the}} minimum MEST has been brought forward. It is shown that, when the minimal foot roll pitch is fixed, the minimum MEST is steady. But at the same time, when the MEST does not exceed the minimum value, the round bloom off-round would happen, it is worse for the round bloom than the bulging for the normal strand. And there is the cross point with the curve of the minimum MEST by the minimum roll pitch and the minimum MEST by the fluting include angle of the support roller and the lateral support roller against the cross section...|$|R

An example of this limitation can be demonstrated in dicing an onion—a Western knife generally slices downward and then rocks the tip forward to complete a cut; the Santoku relies more on a single downward cut and even landing from heel to tip, thus using less of a rocking motion than Western style cutlery.|$|R

40|$|It has {{previously}} been shown that a bipedal model consisting of a point mass supported by spring limbs can be tuned to simulate periodic human walking. In this study, we incorporated <b>roller</b> <b>feet</b> into the spring-mass model and evaluated the effect of roller radius, impact angle, and limb stiffness on spatiotemporal gait characteristics, ground reactions, and center-of-pressure excursions. We also evaluated {{the potential of the}} improved model to predict speed-dependent changes in ground reaction forces and centerof-pressure excursions observed during normal human walking. We were able to find limit cycles that exhibited gait-like motion across a wide spectrum of model parameters. Incorporation of the <b>roller</b> <b>foot</b> �R� 0. 3 m � reduced the magnitude of peak ground reaction forces and allowed for forward center-of-pressure progression, making the model more consistent with human walking. At a fixed walking speed, increasing the limb impact angle reduced the cadence and prolonged stance duration. Increases in either limb stiffness or impact angle tended to result in more oscillatory vertical ground reactions. Simultaneous modulation of the limb impact angle and limb stiffness was needed to induce speed-related changes in ground reactions that were consistent with those measured during normal human walking, with better quantitative agreement achieved at slower speeds. We conclude that a simple mass-spring model with <b>roller</b> <b>feet</b> can well describe ground reaction forces, and hence center of mass motion, observed during normal human walking. �DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 3005147...|$|R
