The types of financial transactions which a customer may transact through online banking {{are determined by the}} financial institution, but usually includes obtaining account balances, a list of the recent transactions, electronic bill payments and funds transfers between a customer's or another's accounts. Most banks also enable a customer to download copies of bank statements, which can be printed at the customer's premises (some banks charge a fee for mailing hard copies of bank statements). Some banks also enable customers to download transactions directly into the customer's accounting software. The facility may also enable the customer to order a cheque book, statements, report loss of credit cards, <b>stop</b> <b>payment</b> on a cheque, advise change of address and other routine actions.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "bubble" [...] burst {{at the end}} of 1720, when {{opponents of}} the {{financier}} attempted to convert their notes into specie en masse, forcing the bank to <b>stop</b> <b>payment</b> on its paper notes. By the end of 1720 Philippe d'Orléans had dismissed Law from his positions. Law then fled France for Brussels, eventually moving on to Venice, where he lived off his gambling. He was buried in the church San Moisè in Venice.|$|E

60|$|At {{this moment}} the {{messenger}} whom Skindeep had despatched returned, and informed him with great regret that his banker, {{to whom he}} had entrusted his whole fortune, had been so unlucky as to <b>stop</b> <b>payment</b> during his absence. It was expected, however, that when his stud was sold a respectable dividend might be realised. This was the personage of prepossessing appearance who had presented Popanilla with a perpetual ticket to his picture gallery.

6000|$|We {{ignored his}} noise. But Hermann's {{excitement}} suddenly {{went off the}} boil as when you remove a saucepan from the fire.

He, Hermann, would not, perhaps, turn up again {{in this part of the}} world for years to come, since he was going to sell the Diana at the end of this very trip ("Go home passenger in a mail boat," [...] he murmured mechanically). He was therefore safe from Falk's malice.

60|$|The {{enemies of}} the late House of Commons resolved, if possible, to bring on that event. They {{therefore}} endeavored to misrepresent the provident means adopted by the House of Commons for keeping off this invidious necessity, as {{an attack on the}} rights of the East India Company: for they well knew, that, on the one hand, if, for want of proper regulation and relief, the Company should become insolvent, or even <b>stop</b> <b>payment,</b> the national credit and commerce would sustain a heavy blow; and that calamity would be justly imputed to Parliament, which, after such long inquiries, and such frequent admonitions from his Majesty, had neglected so essential and so urgent an article of their duty: on the other hand, they knew, that, wholly corrupted as the Company is, nothing effectual could be done to preserve that interest from ruin, without taking for a time the national objects of their trust out of their hands; and then a cry would be industriously raised against the House of Commons, as depriving British subjects of their legal privileges. The restraint, being plain and simple, must be easily understood by those who would be brought with great difficulty to comprehend the intricate detail of matters of fact which rendered this suspension of the administration of India absolutely necessary on motives of justice, of policy, of public honor, and public safety.|$|E
