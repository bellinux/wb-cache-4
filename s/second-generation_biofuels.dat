40|$|An {{important}} but little understood aspect of bioenergy production is its overall impact on soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. Increased energy production from biomass will inevitably {{lead to higher}} input of its by-products to the soil as amendments or fertilizers. However, it is still unclear how these by-products will influence microbial transformation processes in soil, and thereby its greenhouse gas (GHG) balance and organic C stocks. In this study, we assess C and N dynamics and GHG emissions following application of different bioenergy by-products to soil. Ten by-products were selected from different bioenergy chains: anaerobic digestion (manure digestates), first generation biofuel by-products (rapeseed meal, distilled dried grains with solubles), <b>second-generation</b> <b>biofuel</b> by-products (nonfermentables from hydrolysis of different lignocellulosic materials) and pyrolysis (biochars).

The agent-based approach introduces interactions among farmers about new technologies and market opportunities, and includes the updating of forecast expectations and uncertainties using Bayesian inference. The model is applied to a semi-hypothetical example case of farmers in the Salt Creek Watershed in Central Illinois, and a sensitivity analysis is performed to effect a first-order assessment of the plausibility of the results. The results show that the most influential factors affecting farmers' decisions are crop prices, production costs, and yields. The results also show that different farmer behavioral profiles can lead to different predictions of farmer decisions. The farmers who are predicted to be more likely to adopt new practices are those who interact more with other farmers, are less risk averse, quick to adjust their expectations, and slow to reduce their forecast confidence. The decisions of farmers have direct water quality consequences, especially those pertaining to the adoption of the <b>second-generation</b> <b>biofuel</b> crop, which are estimated to lead to reductions in stream nitrate load.

Thermotolerant yeast strains that can undergo fermentation at temperatures above 40 °C are suitable alternatives for developing the simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) process to overcome the limitations of SHF. This review describes the various approaches to screen and develop thermotolerant yeasts via genetic and metabolic engineering. The advantages and limitations of SSF at high temperatures are also discussed. A critical insight into the effect of high temperatures on yeast morphology and physiology is also included.
