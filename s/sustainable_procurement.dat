40|$|The {{possibility}} to integrate sustainability considerations {{in the public}} procurement process has been debated over recent decades, resulting in several legislative changes. Collaboration {{between public and private}} sectors is emphasised as important in the development of <b>sustainable</b> public <b>procurement</b> but few studies focus on public-private collaboration related to <b>sustainable</b> public <b>procurement.</b> This article contributes to this area of research through an empirical case study of the integration of social and environmental considerations in Swedish public procurement of construction work. A pilot project to enable employment of youth in a construction project is used as a case study. An analysis is conducted of the institutional incentives that exist regarding sustainability considerations, both {{from the perspective of the}} public sector actor (the procuring authority) and the private sector actor (the contractor). A model of institutional incentives is developed that broadens the concept of incentives for use beyond merely regulative incentives or financial or contractual incentives. The findings show that regulative incentives have been subordinated other types of institutional incentives in <b>sustainable</b> public <b>procurement</b> practice. The complexity of institutional incentives is important to highlight in order to understand <b>sustainable</b> public <b>procurement</b> in practice, and what factors may contribute as well as hinder the decision-making processes related to sustainability objectives...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the regulation of}} <b>sustainable</b> public <b>procurement</b> in the Republic of Turkey {{in the context of}} Turkey’s membership negotiations with the European Union. <b>Sustainable</b> public <b>procurement</b> is the procurement whereby contracting authorities take account of all three pillars of sustainable development (economic, social and environmental) when procuring goods, services or works. The thesis aims to clarify whether and to what extent sustainable development concerns can be taken into account under the Public Procurement Act numbered 4734, which is the main legal framework of public procurement in Turkey. Furthermore, it aims to identify possible options for improving <b>sustainable</b> development-oriented public <b>procurement</b> regulation in Turkey. The thesis essentially uses black letter and comparative legal research methods in order to achieve its objectives. This thesis argues that the correlation between public <b>procurement</b> and <b>sustainable</b> development is strong in the EU, whereas such a correlation shows a weak profile in Turkey. In that regard, this thesis proposes the rules that need to be improved for establishing a <b>sustainable</b> public <b>procurement</b> system in Turkey, taking into account the local dynamics of the Turkish public procurement system, and {{in the context of the}} membership negotiations with the EU. This thesis argues that the existence of a clear mandate for sustainability concerns, putting forward a strong political backing, establishing a coherent institutional framework and laying down a consistent and clear legal framework and an effective enforcement/remedy system are the essential peripheral conditions for promoting <b>sustainable</b> public <b>procurement</b> in Turkey.

40|$|Growing {{concerns}} regarding sustainability {{have led the}} construction sector to adopt various policy instruments for reducing the impacts caused by construction activities. One such policy instrument includes impact assessment, which enables the construction sector to evaluate the environmental consequences of proposed developments at project (environmental impact assessment) and strategic (strategic environmental assessment) level. In recent years, the construction sector has also adopted green public procurement, which is a process whereby contracting authorities aim to procure services and products that meet environmental requirements. In certain contexts, green public procurement has extended to <b>sustainable</b> public <b>procurement,</b> which involves the incorporation of both environmental and social considerations in the procurement of services and products. Promoting sustainability in the constructor sector is a significant challenge. This challenge is primarily due to the requirement of high levels of cooperation among project stakeholders, on the one hand, {{and a lack of}} coordination between project planning and implementation on the other hand. Therefore, procurement plays a significant role as it establishes the tone for the interaction between contracting authorities and contractors. The overall aim of this thesis is to bolster the knowledge of promoting sustainability in the construction sector, with the specific aim of analysing the ways in which policy instruments such as environmental impact assessment and green public procurement can be reinforced to improve the coordination between planning and the implementation of sustainability considerations. This thesis conceptualises an inter-link between impact assessment and green public procurement, and identifies the opportunities to develop the inter-link. It is appropriate to plan for green public procurement at the pre-decision phase of an environmental impact assessment. The inter-link can be strengthened by involving contractors in planning for green and <b>sustainable</b> public <b>procurement.</b> One way to involve contractors is with the aid of competitive dialogue procedure, which is a procurement procedure that allows contracting authorities to hold discussions with contractors regarding the authority’s requirements. This study strengthens the conceptualisation that competitive dialogue procedure can facilitate green and <b>sustainable</b> public <b>procurement.</b> The various elements in a competitive dialogue procedure can enable the contracting authorities to ensure the consistency between the weight for environmental considerations in contract award criteria and the relevant preferences. This thesis also discusses key concerns for progress towards <b>sustainable</b> public <b>procurement,</b> which includes among others the incorporation of sustainability values in procurement decisions. In addition, this study identified certain discourses on future trends for green and <b>sustainable</b> public <b>procurement.</b> The discourses provide an opportunity for reflection, and thereby indicate that analytical support is required to develop criteria in a way that enables the evaluation of <b>sustainable</b> public <b>procurement</b> against the background of sustainability and justice regarding natural capital. Innovation must be promoted with a focus on sustainability values. Moreover, green or <b>sustainable</b> public <b>procurement</b> must be discussed between contracting authorities and contractors in light of its contribution to sustainability.

40|$|Sustainable {{or green}} public {{procurement}} is a growing trend that is beginning to lead vast supply chains towards implementing more sustainable practices and achieving environmental, social and economic objectives. The use of product-service systems (PSS) by public entities can also result in sustainability benefits. PSS are an innovative business approach that shifts the traditional business focus from selling physical products only (e. g. a washing machine) to selling a mix of products and services (e. g. cleaning services) that are jointly capable of meeting specific client demand (clean clothes). The key idea behind PSS is that consumers do not demand products per se, but are seeking the utility provided by products and services. One value-added of PSS lies in their potential to decouple consumption from economic growth, as they offer the possibility of meeting more needs with lower material and energy requirements. This technical report, Using Product-Service Systems to Enhance Public Procurement, examines the nexus between product-service systems and <b>sustainable</b> public <b>procurement,</b> drawing together international experience. The aim of this report is, in particular, to demonstrate how product-service systems {{can be used by}} governments in the context of <b>sustainable</b> public <b>procurement</b> (SPP) policies and initiatives, thus contributing to a more resource-efficient, lowcarbon and inclusive green economy. Some examples of the use of product-service systems by government organizations are given in the case studies in Annex I. The 10 -Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production Patterns (10 YFP) is a global framework that enhances international cooperation to accelerate the shift towards sustainable consumption and production (SCP) in both developed and developing countries. One of the key objectives of the 10 YFP is to encourage innovation and cooperation among all countries and stakeholders. This technical report is a direct outcome of activities that were part of the 10 YFP <b>Sustainable</b> Public <b>Procurement</b> Programme  the first formal programme launched under this new framework of international cooperation. The report was developed by partners in the <b>Sustainable</b> Public <b>Procurement</b> Programme of the 10 YFP, in Working Group 3 A on "product-service systems and their insertion in sustainable public procurement". This technical report is intended to assist governments in evaluating the potential of productservice systems to act as a driver in achieving their sustainability goals.
