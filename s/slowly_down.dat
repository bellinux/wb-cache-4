5|$|Activated in 1949, the {{regiment}} trained {{for more than}} a year before the outbreak of the war on June 25, 1950. On that day, half of {{the regiment}} led North Korean forces against South Korean troops by land and sea, pushing them back after several days of fighting. Over the next six weeks the regiment advanced <b>slowly</b> <b>down</b> the Korean Peninsula, acting as a forward unit of the North Korean army. Suffering from a lack of supplies and mounting casualties, the regiment was committed to the Battle of Pusan Perimeter as part of a push to force United Nations (UN) troops out of Korea.|$|E
5|$|The jaguar is a stalk-and-ambush {{rather than}} a chase predator. The cat will walk <b>slowly</b> <b>down</b> forest paths, {{listening}} for and stalking prey before rushing or ambushing. The jaguar attacks from cover and usually from a target's blind spot with a quick pounce; the species' ambushing abilities are considered nearly peerless in the animal kingdom by both indigenous people and field researchers, and are probably a product of its role as an apex predator in several different environments. The ambush may include leaping into water after prey, as a jaguar is quite capable of carrying a large kill while swimming; its strength is such that carcasses {{as large as a}} heifer can be hauled up a tree to avoid flood levels.|$|E
25|$|Landslide {{in which}} the sliding surface is located within the soil mantle or {{weathered}} bedrock (typically to a depth from few decimetres to some metres)is called a shallow landslide. They usually include debris slides, debris flow, and failures of road cut-slopes. Landslides occurring as single large blocks of rock moving <b>slowly</b> <b>down</b> slope are sometimes called block glides.|$|E

Towed from her mooring on 27 July 2008, she was guided <b>slowly</b> <b>down</b> the Tyne at low tide by two tugs. She passed under the Gateshead Millennium Bridge, which had been {{designed}} to accommodate this move when installed in November 2000. Due to fog at the coast, she was moored overnight at Northumbria Quay, North Shields and left the next day, with an ocean-going tug towing her to Greece.|$|E
25|$|Sheridan {{began moving}} aggressively in September. He {{defeated}} Early in the Third Battle of Winchester on September 19 and the Battle of Fisher's Hill on September 21–22. With Early damaged and pinned down, the Valley lay {{open to the}} Union. Coupled with Sherman's capture of Atlanta and Adm. David Farragut's victory at Mobile Bay, Lincoln's re-election seemed assured. Sheridan pulled back <b>slowly</b> <b>down</b> the Valley and conducted a scorched earth campaign that presaged Sherman's March to the Sea in November. The goal was to deny the Confederacy the means of feeding its armies in Virginia, and Sheridan's army burned crops, barns, mills, and factories.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{flush toilet}} is a vitreous, ceramic bowl {{containing}} water, plus plumbing to rapidly {{fill it with}} more water. The water in the toilet bowl is connected to a hollow drain pipe shaped like an upside-down U connecting the drain. One side of the U channel is arranged as a hollow siphon tube longer than {{the water in the}} bowl is high. The siphon tube connects to the drain. The top of the upside-down U-shaped drain pipe limits the height of the water in the bowl before it flows down the drain. If water is poured slowly into the bowl it simply flows over the rim of the upside-down U and pours <b>slowly</b> <b>down</b> the drain—thus the toilet does not flush. The standing water in the bowl acts as a barrier to sewer gas coming out of the sewer through the drain, and also as a receptacle for waste. Sewer gas is vented through a separate vent pipe attached to the sewer line.|$|E

25|$|The {{guns were}} still {{operable}} so Brooke had his men return the pirates' fire. No hits were made but near hits forced the pirates {{to leave their}} wounded and abandon ship without fighting. Brooke then decided on rescuing the survivors {{though most of the}} Sulus took their weapons into the water and continued to fight. The captain also had his men refloat the steamer which was done somewhat easily. Few pirates were recovered according to McDougall and when they saved all that could be, the Rainbow and the Jolly Bachelor continued on <b>slowly</b> <b>down</b> the coast. During this time one of the pirates said that there were three more prahus nearby which were waiting for the three already engaged to rejoin them. After an hour the weather was very calm and a lookout at the masthead spotted the three enemy ships to the starboard, lining up to bear their bow guns on the approaching steamers. However, when the wind picked up again the pirates changed their tactics and hoisted sail to move their ships into broadside position. As the Sarawakians neared the pirates they opened up with their swivels but Brooke waited until his ships were 250 yards away before he gave his men the order to return the fire.|$|E
25|$|On 10 November 2006 Raviraj led a {{demonstration}} outside the UNICEF office in Colombo protesting against the Vaharai bombing in which 45 {{civilians were killed}} by army shelling. The following morning Raviraj {{took part in a}} live discussion on TV Derana between 7.00am and 7.30am. Afterwards he returned to his home in Manning Town, Narahenpita, had breakfast and changed for work. Raviraj had to drive to work himself as his driver was on leave. He had intended to use his wife's car but finding its battery drained got into his Toyota Land Cruiser Prado (reg WP KE 1279). Raviraj's police bodyguard Sergeant Lokuwellamurage Shantha Laxman Lokuwella got onto the passenger seat. At 8.39am, as Raviraj was driving <b>slowly</b> <b>down</b> Martha Road and turning into Elvitigala Mawatha, a motorcycle (reg JE 3507) coming from the opposite direction stopped nearby. The motorcycle's passenger got down, removed his helmet, crossed the road and waited on the pavement with a bag over his shoulder. As Raviraj's vehicle went past, the motorcycle passenger ripped open the shoulder bag and fired the T-56 hidden inside. Raviraj's vehicle was hit from the front, side and rear at point blank range. After firing an entire magazine the assassin ran back to the motorcycle which then sped off, turning into Martha Road. The shoulder bag, with the T-56 inside, and the assassin's helmet were left at the roadside. According to the police a rickshaw parked nearby also drove off after the shooting. They believed that its driver had been a look out who had tipped off the assassins about the location of Raviraj's vehicle using a mobile phone.|$|E
500|$|Indeed, {{far from}} being a radical or {{threatening}} manifestation of womanhood, recent academics have noted {{the extent to which the}} character of She conforms to traditional conceptions of Victorian femininity; in particular her deferring devotion to Kallikrates/Leo, whom she swears wifely obedience to at the story's climax: [...] "'Behold!' and she took his [...] hand and placed it upon her shapely head, and then bent herself <b>slowly</b> <b>down</b> till one knee for an instant touched the ground – 'Behold! in token of submission do I bow me to my lord!

500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Early Winter" [...] {{was directed by}} Stefani's frequent collaborator Sophie Muller, who had previously directed the music videos of [...] "Cool" [...] and [...] "Wind It Up". Filming of the music video took place at destinations like Budapest, Milan, and Prague, where Stefani had been touring during The Sweet Escape Tour in October 2007. It opens with a black-and-white scene of Stefani {{lying on the ground}} in a long white gown. In the next scene, Stefani is shown walking on the street under red street lights and then holds her love interest, played by her tour backup dancer Steelo Vazquez, against the wall and talks to him. The scene then changes to Stefani walking on a street and later walking into the railway station. In the next scene, Stefani is seen singing under falling red-coloured feathers in a huge palace-type hall. Scenes of Stefani staring {{at herself in the mirror}} with her hair up and snow falling <b>slowly</b> <b>down,</b> with the lights turning on and off intermittently, are interspersed throughout the video. Stefani is also seen sitting on the ground and singing while crying. She is then shown at a railway station walking besides a moving train. The video ends with Stefani running out of the hall. Tamar Anitai from MTV Buzzworthy praised the video for being [...] "acutely artful, immeasurably stylish" [...] and commented that [...] "Gwen’s managed to raise the bar on her own superlatively supreme style in her new video." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1977, Davis Publications {{launched}} Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine, {{and after}} Bova's departure, Joel Davis, {{the owner of}} Davis Publications, contacted Condé Nast {{with a view to}} acquiring Analog. [...] Analog had always been something of a misfit in Condé Nast's line up, which included Mademoiselle and Vogue, and by February 1980 the deal was agreed. [...] The first issue published by Davis was dated September 1980. [...] Davis was willing to put some effort into marketing Analog, so Schmidt regarded the change as likely to be beneficial, and in fact circulation quickly grew, reversing a gradual decline over the Bova years, from just over 92,000 in 1981 to almost 110,000 two years later. [...] Starting with the first 1981 issue, Davis switched Analog to a four-weekly schedule, rather than monthly, to align the production schedule with a weekly calendar. [...] Instead of being dated [...] "January 1981", the first issue under the new regime was dated [...] "January 5, 1981", but this approach led to newsstands removing the magazine much more quickly, since the date gave the impression that it was a weekly magazine. [...] The cover date was changed back to the current month starting with the April 1982 issue, but the new schedule remained in place, with a [...] "Mid-September" [...] issue in 1982 and 1983, and [...] "Mid-December" [...] issues {{for more than a decade}} thereafter. [...] Circulation trended <b>slowly</b> <b>down</b> over the 1980s, to 83,000 for the year ending in 1990; by this time the great majority of readers were subscribers, as newsstand sales declined to only 15,000.|$|E

2500|$|By September 15, {{the fire}} had burned [...] and was 60 percent contained. [...] Fire crews {{continued}} to work on rehabilitating fire line along the northwestern side of the fire area.

[...] This activity was expected to continue until a season ending rain or snow fall naturally extinguished the last pockets of fire. On September 24, the Forest Service announced that the Milli Fire was 100 percent contained.

2500|$|Ring 3: Against God, Art, and Nature: The {{third round}} of the seventh circle is a great Plain of Burning Sand {{scorched}} by great flakes of flame falling <b>slowly</b> <b>down</b> from the sky, an image derived from the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen. 19:24.) The Blasphemers (the Violent against God) are stretched supine upon the burning sand, the Sodomites (the Violent against Nature) run in circles, while the Usurers (the Violent against Art, which is the Grandchild of God, as explained in Canto XI) crouch huddled and weeping. Ciardi writes, [...] "Blasphemy, sodomy, and usury are all unnatural and sterile actions: thus the unbearing desert is the eternity of these sinners; and thus the rain, which in nature should be fertile and cool, descends as fire". Dante finds Capaneus {{stretched out on the}} sands; for blasphemy against Jove, he was struck down with a thunderbolt during the Siege of Thebes; he is still scorning Jove in the afterlife.
