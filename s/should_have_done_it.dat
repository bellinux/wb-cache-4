500|$|Reid {{believes}} that ex-Republic of Ireland manager, Steve Staunton, {{should not have}} been sacked, the midfielder explained, [...] "I do not believe they <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it.</b> I believe he should have been given more time".|$|E
500|$|The better {{conditions}} in {{here are not}} down to the prison department. But for the riot, we would {{still be in the}} same old jail banged up all day and slopping out ... The rioters brought this about. These conditions ... should not have cost the lives of a prisoner, a prison officer and two huge court trials. They <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> years ago but it took a riot to get them to do it.|$|E
500|$|... {{all came}} down to one {{sentence}} in the [...] "X" [...] article where I said that wherever these people, meaning the Soviet leadership, confronted us with dangerous hostility anywhere in the world, we should {{do everything possible to}} contain it and not let them expand any further. I should have explained that I didn't suspect them of any desire to launch an attack on us. This was right after the war, and it was absurd to suppose {{that they were going to}} turn around and attack the United States. I didn't think I needed to explain that, but I obviously <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} corporal, [...] "I guess I didn't see anybody, after all. It was quite dark, anyway, {{in among the}} trees. Winter's {{shutting}} down on us 'most a month before <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done.</b> <b>It's</b> kind of fortunate we sent the horses out when we did. I don't know {{what they wanted to}} bring them for. Nobody has any use for horses in this country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; {{simply because}} she {{happened}} {{to know that the}} other one had cared for him first. Why <b>should</b> she <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it?</b> What right <b>had</b> she?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose you're right," [...] she muttered. [...] "I know {{my father}} thinks so; but--I <b>should</b> never <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> myself. I can't take things lying down." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers in both races {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Although Bird spoke of his satisfaction of controlling {{the pace of the}} feature race, he believed he was fortunate because of him receiving a new rear wing after being impacted by Ceccon at the first start, [...] "It’s an amazing to be able to win my first GP2 race in Monaco. Maybe I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> already in the past in GP2, but it felt pretty right today." [...] Ceccon stated he was [...] "happy" [...] to secure second place and praised his team for his strategy that enabled him to move ahead of Evans, [...] " [...] It’s my first GP2 podium and it’s {{two years in a row}} that I finish on the podium here since I finished third last year in GP3 here as well. Today, I finished in P2 in race 1. It’s good." [...] When asked if he was disappointed over his third place finish, Evans replied yes as he struggled with grip on his supersoft compound tyres at the restart and was being pressured by Bird on the harder soft compound tyres. Evans believed that had he overtaken Ceccon he could have had similar pace levels to Bird and felt the best possible result he could have achieved was second but stated he would accept the result.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{before the}} {{commencement}} of construction, the tunnel was criticised for not being high enough. Critics argued {{that it would not}} be able to accommodate heavy goods vehicles higher than 4.65m (15ft) and that it should be built with an operating height of 5.5m to accommodate virtually all sizes of trucks. Proponents of the chosen design argued that it made best economic sense and that it would be able to accommodate most heavy vehicles with only a minor percentage having to use the surface road network. Construction went ahead as planned, but speaking at the breakthrough ceremony, Jimmy Quinn of the Irish Road Haulage Association stated that a future generation may look back and say (about the tunnel not being high enough for very high trucks): [...] "Maybe they <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> when they were building it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2008, The Times {{reported}} that Lewis had {{turned down a}} seven-figure sum from Mohamed Al Fayed to open a Harrods sale. Lewis commented that she turned down the deal {{on the grounds that}} Harrods is the only UK department store that continues to stock clothing made from animal fur: [...] "It wasn't a million pounds that I was offered, as the papers reported, but even if it had been, I still would have turned it down". [...] "I got a lot of flak for that. There were people who said I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> and given the money to charity, but that would have been such a contradiction." [...] She announced in October 2008 that she was in the [...] "bargaining period" [...] of launching her own ethical line of accessories through Topshop and that she was in the late stages of releasing her own perfume in Europe. Her perfume, Leona Lewis, was launched by LR in July 2009. In 2010, she set up a fashion company with her then-boyfriend, Lou Al-Chamaa, called LOA Clothing Ltd, which was dissolved in 2012.|$|E
60|$|MARGARET. I cant tell you. I <b>dont</b> {{understand}} <b>it</b> myself. The prayer meeting set me free, somehow. I <b>should</b> never <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> if it {{were not}} for the prayer meeting.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Allah! How he fought! We <b>should</b> never <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> {{but for the}} drugs. That was {{his white}} blood, I take it,' said Mahbub testily. 'Go on with the dawut [invocation]. Give him full Protection.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Slowly Coblich {{turned toward}} the door. [...] "You are right," [...] he said, [...] "but may God have mercy on my soul. I never thought that I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> with my own hands." ...|$|R
2500|$|Publicist Marvet Britto stated, [...] "Jackson embodies grace, {{style and}} integrity...She {{has never been}} known as a bad person." [...] Britto {{describes}} Jackson’s videotaped apology as [...] "impersonal", saying, [...] "She has never been an impersonal artist, so it made it seem like she was guilty of something, and she wasn't. I would have had her and Timberlake apologizing side by side right from the beginning, since they performed side by side. Otherwise, it made the whole apology seem calculated and contrived." [...] Jackson said of the apology, [...] "I probably <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> live. But {{there was so much}} going on at the time that I needed to just get it done. It is what it is. And it will pass, and I'm fine with it." [...] At one point Jackson was scheduled to be interviewed about the incident by Diane Sawyer on the ABC newsmagazine Primetime, however, the interview never came to fruition. Jackson later briefly discussed the incident on Good Morning America and the Late Show with David Letterman. Jackson's outfit was designed by famed designer Alexander McQueen, with Jackson later commenting [...] "I don't blame him; he didn't rip it. Alexander is so great at what he does – he's a genius." [...] In an interview with Australia's Herald Sun, Jackson commented on Timberlake (whom, as mentioned, Jackson had previously known personally and aided when she selected his former group 'N Sync to open for her Velvet Rope World Tour at the start of their career) distancing himself from the incident and seemingly changing with fame. [...] "I really want to be honest about this, but I just feel that anything I say about him will be taken the wrong way", said Jackson. [...] "I do think that Justin is very talented and that he has a very big career ahead of him. But he seems to have changed recently. He's gotten a bit cocky. You know, some people can handle success and some people can't. I'm starting to wonder if (the latter) is the case with Justin. And it hurts me to say that." [...] Producer Jimmy Jam revealed Jackson considered writing a song about the incident for her Damita Jo album, saying, [...] "I don't know whether it will or not. But I have a feeling it probably will, because kind of whatever's happening in her life tends to be what she writes about [...] It'd be kind of interesting to see what her feeling is about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it,</b> Jasper, we <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it,</b> had it {{not been}} for a circumstance; these {{circumstances}} are serious matters, and no prudent man will overlook them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, I ought, I know. In fact, {{some years}} ago I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> immediately, because I had a reason for pushing on that way just then.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It must be awful," [...] Rupert agreed. [...] "I do {{not know}} what I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> been me, and you know it might just as well have been me as Edgar. I wish it were five o'clock!" ...|$|R
60|$|JACK. I don't {{know about}} the gravity. Of course, I 'm very sorry {{if you think it}} was wrong. Have n't I said so! I <b>should</b> never <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> at all if I had n't been so jolly hard up.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{will be a}} near thing, senor," [...] one of them said, towards morning. [...] "The current {{counts for}} three or four miles against us. If it hadn't been for that, we <b>should</b> {{certainly}} <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it.</b> As it is, it is doubtful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{had thought}} of the Marconigram," [...] Aynesworth said, [...] "I am sure I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it.</b> But {{as a matter of}} fact, I did not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And, if I {{have not}} said so as I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> <b>it</b> {{has not been}} from want of feeling. I do believe you did what you thought best when Mary told you that story at Matching." ...|$|E
60|$|M. le Duc sighed when {{he thought}} it all out. Though Lydie had done exactly what he himself wanted her to do, he hated {{the idea that she}} <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> because Gaston de Stainville had persuaded her.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't believe you. You {{brought him}} back because this man whom you call Fisher got to know of your plans. Why <b>should</b> you <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> because of me? Why <b>should</b> you <b>have</b> put my {{interests}} before Mrs Ford's? I am nothing to you.' ...|$|R
60|$|MRS BRIDGENORTH. No: {{marriage}} came {{natural to}} me. I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> thought <b>it</b> <b>did</b> to you too.|$|R
60|$|Mark you, I am not {{defending}} James Datchett. I hold no brief for James. On the contrary, I am very decidedly of {{the opinion}} that he <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it.</b> I merely say that there were extenuating circumstances. Just that. Ext. circ. Nothing more.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it,</b> my dear, I'm afraid," [...] {{returned}} Caleb, [...] "if I {{could have}} made her better than she was. But I must have changed her for the worse, if I had changed her at all. Nothing could improve her, Bertha." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I admire you for it, old boy. I don't believe I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> at your age--too {{much of a}} Forsyte, I'm afraid. But I {{suppose the}} type gets thinner with each generation. Your son, if you have one, may be a pure altruist; who knows?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{once thought}} {{of going to a}} factory town," [...] she answered, without wilful evasion, [...] "to begin my {{practice}} there among the operatives' children. I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> {{if it had not been}} for coming here with Mrs. Maynard. It would have been better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{more than}} I can tell you. There's no glass about {{that he could}} have drunk it from. He might have got it in capsule form. But why <b>should</b> he <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it?</b> He was always a pretty cheerful sort of old man, wasn't he?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My word!" [...] he said, {{between his}} gasps, [...] "that was touch and go. If I hadn't managed to catch that rock, and {{known how to}} swim, I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been <b>done.</b> <b>It</b> runs like a mill-race, and I could feel no bottom." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What, with Hugh? No; Hugh and I <b>do</b> not hit <b>it</b> off together. If I shot at Clavering I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> {{as a sort}} of head-keeper. It's {{a higher}} position, I know, than that of an usher, but it doesn't suit me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 3. For {{the matter}} with which they worshipped. Instead of {{bringing}} according to the commandment, they brought the lame, the torn, and the sick; they would sanctify themselves in gardens, with swine's flesh and mice, when they <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> at Jerusalem, with bullocks and lambs (Isa 66:17).|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, Mr Nickleby,' said Squeers, insinuating {{himself into}} the warmest corner, 'you did very right to catch hold of them horses. I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> myself if I had come to in time, but I am very glad you did it. You did it very well; very well.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No;--nor should I. I {{never did}} such a {{thing in my life}} before. But as he was there I had to show that I was not ashamed of him! Do you think I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> if you all had not been there?" [...] Then again she burst into tears.|$|E
6000|$|... "And just {{at present}} I could very ill afford <b>it.</b> I <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> I not felt it a pity to neglect such {{a chance of}} rising in the world. After all, {{a seat in the}} British House of Commons is an honour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{what else}} <b>should</b> we <b>have</b> <b>done?</b> <b>It</b> would <b>have</b> been very dull and stupid to {{have stayed in}} together," [...] said Cecil, with a world of {{innocent}} wonder in her eyes. Then turning to her neighbour, [...] "Surely, Julius, you went about and saw things!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Julia, dear, I {{will never}} speak of Mr. Shoreham again. I <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>it</b> now <b>had</b> I not thought his attentions were {{acceptable}} to you, as I am {{sure they are}} to your parents.
