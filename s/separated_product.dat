This leads us to impose five conditions P 1 to P 5 on L. We show that conditions P 1 to P 4 are physically necessary and prove that if L satisfies conditions P 1 to P 5, then L is the <b>separated</b> <b>product</b> proposed by Aerts in 1982 to describe independent quantum systems (theorem 2). Finally, we explain why the <b>separated</b> <b>product</b> {{may not be the}} right candidate and therefore ask whether there exists a cao-lattice not isomorphic to the <b>separated</b> <b>product</b> that satisfies conditions P 1 to P 4...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the description of}} two independent quantum systems by a complete atomistic ortho-lattice (cao-lattice) L. It is known that since the two systems are independent, no Hilbert space description is possible, i. e. L ̸ = P(H), the lattice of closed subspaces of a Hilbert space (theorem 1). We impose five conditions on L. Four of them are shown to be physically necessary. The last one relates the orthogonality between states in each system to the ortho-complementation of L. It can be justified if one assumes that the orthogonality between states in the total system induces the ortho-complementation of L. We prove that if L satisfies these five conditions, then L is the <b>separated</b> <b>product</b> proposed by Aerts in 1982 to describe independent quantum systems (theorem 2). Finally, we give strong arguments to exclude the <b>separated</b> <b>product</b> and therefore our last condition. As a consequence, we ask whether among the ca-lattices that satisfy our first four basic necessary conditions, there exists an ortho-complemented one different from the <b>separated</b> <b>product...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{illustrate}} {{some problems}} {{that are related to}} the existence of an underlying linear structure {{at the level of the}} property lattice associated with a physical system, for the particular case of two explicitly separated spin 1 / 2 objects that are considered, and mathematically described, as one compound system. It is shown that the <b>separated</b> <b>product</b> of the property lattices corresponding with the two spin 1 / 2 objects does not have an underlying linear structure, although the property lattices associated with the subobjects in isolation manifestly do. This is related at a fundamental level to the fact that separated products do not behave well with respect to the covering law (and orthomodularity) of elementary lattice theory. In addition, we discuss the orthogonality relation associated with the <b>separated</b> <b>product</b> in general and consider the related problem of the behavior of the corresponding Sasaki projections as partial state space mapping...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Let L be the poset describing, in {{the sense}} of Birkhoff and von Neumann [4], the {{experimental}} propositions about a physical system S. In quantum logic, it is generally assumed that L is an orthocomplemented lattice. Here, we show that L is not orthocomplemented if S consists of two separated quantum systems. By separated, we mean non-interacting and prepared independently (hence only product states). We proceed as follow: First we define s−tensor products of complete atomistic lattices in terms of four axioms, weaker than those of previous works [3, 18, 19]. Then we prove that a s−tensor product is orthocomplemented if and only if it is isomorphic to the <b>separated</b> <b>product</b> of Aerts [1] (Theorem 5. 4). Finally, we point out two paradoxes if S is described by the <b>separated</b> <b>product.</b> As a corollary of our representation theorem, we recover previous results about orthomodular tensor products in quantum logic [18]. 1...|$|E

In our model, firms invest in productivity-enhancing worker training before Cournot competition takes place. When two <b>separated</b> <b>product</b> markets become integrated {{and are thus}} replaced with a market with greater demand and greater firm number, training by each firm increases provided the two countries are sufficiently small. When barriers between large markets are eliminated, training is reduced. Similar results hold when firms in countries with different training systems face globalization of product markets. In particular, apprenticeship sys-tems are threatened by a large-scale integration of product markets.

40|$|Physical {{separation}} {{with class}} refinements and method refinements à la AHEAD and virtual separation using annotations à la #ifdef or CIDE are two competing groups of implementation approaches for software product lines with complementary advantages. Although both {{groups have been}} mainly discussed in isolation, we strive for an integration to leverage the respective advantages. In this paper, we {{provide the basis for}} such an integration by providing a model that supports both, physical and virtual separation, and by describing refactorings in both directions. We prove the refactorings complete, such that every virtually <b>separated</b> <b>product</b> line can be automatically transformed into a physically separated one (replacing annotations by refinements) and vice versa. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we have implemented the refactorings in our tool CIDE and conducted four case studies. ...|$|E
40|$|To {{effectively}} {{extract the}} typical {{features of the}} bearing, a new method that related the local mean decomposition Shannon entropy and improved kernel principal component analysis model was proposed. First, the features are extracted by time–frequency domain method, local mean decomposition, and using the Shannon entropy to process the original <b>separated</b> <b>product</b> functions, so as to get the original features. However, the features been extracted still contain superfluous information; the nonlinear multi-features process technique, kernel principal component analysis, is introduced to fuse the characters. The kernel principal component analysis is improved by the weight factor.

40|$|Given two {{complete}} atomistic lattices L_ 1 and L_ 2, {{we define}} a set S(L_ 1,L_ 2) of complete atomistic lattices {{by means of}} three axioms (natural regarding the description of separated quantum compound systems), or {{in terms of a}} universal property with respect to a given class of bimorphisms.

With some additional hypotheses on L_ 1 and L_ 2 (true for instance if L_ 1 and L_ 2 are moreover irreducible, orthocomplemented and with the covering property), we characterize the automorphisms of weak tensor products in terms of those of L_ 1 and L_ 2...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{distillation}} {{is widely}} used separation technique in oil and gas refineries. Accurate measurement of the composition of separated constituents is necessary to estimate {{the purity of the}} products. Composition measurement using online analysers causes process delay and requires large initial investment. As a solution to this problem, soft sensor estimators can be used to determine the composition of <b>separated</b> <b>product.</b> In this work soft sensor estimators are used for predicting top and bottom compositions in benzene toluene distillation column. More sensitive tray temperatures, re-boiler duty and reflux rate (measured variables) of distillation column were used to predict top and bottom composition (unmeasured). Data used for soft sensor based estimation are generated using process simulation software HYSYS. NARX based ANFIS algorithm was proposed for soft sensor modelling. In this method, most influential inputs for soft sensor modelling were selected using exhaustive search. Neural network model and ANFIS model are also compared using statistical criteria like root mean square error and correlation coefficient (R 2) values. It has been shown by the results that ANFIS performs better while comparing neural network method and ANFIS with the same number of iteration...|$|E
