40|$|Thermal energy {{transfer}} {{in the atmosphere}} occurs from a high temperature zone to a low one by means of convective vortices where mechanical energy is produced. There are two ways of driving vertical flow {{in the core of}} a vortex: (1) by the direct action of buoyancy acting on hot air and (2) by producing a vertical pressure gradient along the axis of a vortex because of core development involving the lateral spread of the vortex with height. In particular, it indicates that the intensity of convective vortices depends on the depth of the convec-tive layer via thermodynamic efficiency, the enthalpy perturbation across them, and the existence of sources of vorticity. The atmospheric vortex engine (AVE) is a device for producing an artificial vortex. The operation of AVE is {{based on the fact that}} the atmosphere is heated from the bottom and cooled at the top.

40|$|Large-scale {{atmospheric}} {{removal of}} greenhouse gases (GHGs) including methane, nitrous oxide and ozone-depleting halocarbons could reduce global warming more quickly than atmospheric removal of CO 2.

Nitrous oxide {{can be reduced to}} nitrogen and oxygen by photocatalysis; meanwhile halocarbons can be mineralized by red-ox photocatalytic reactions to acid halides and CO 2. Photocatalysis avoids the need for capture and sequestration of these atmospheric components. Here review an unusual hybrid device combining photocatalysis with carbon-free electricity with no-intermittency based on the <b>solar</b> updraft <b>chimney.</b> Then we review experimental evidence regarding photocatalytic transformations of non-CO 2 GHGs. We propose to combine TiO 2 -photocatalysis with <b>solar</b> <b>chimney</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> (SCPPs) to cleanse the atmosphere of non-CO 2 GHGs. Worldwide installation of 50, 000 SCPPs, each of capacity 200 MW, would generate a cumulative 34 PWh of renewable electricity by 2050, taking into account construction time. These SCPPs equipped with photocatalyst would process 1 atmospheric volume each 14 – 16 years, reducing or stopping the atmospheric growth rate of the non-CO 2 GHGs and progressively reducing their atmospheric concentrations. Removal of methane, as compared to other GHGs, has enhanced efficacy in reducing radiative forcing because it liberates more °OH radicals to accelerate the cleaning of the troposphere. The overall reduction in non-CO 2 GHG concentration would help to limit global temperature rise. By physically linking greenhouse gas removal to renewable electricity generation, the hybrid concept would avoid the moral hazard associated with most other climate engineering proposals...|$|R

The collector outlet height was kept constant while the collector outlet diameter and the chimney throat diameter were varied in the second part. The collector inlet opening was also varied.

Detailed measurements of temperature variations along the collector and along the chimney height were performed. The air velocity at the location of turbine was measured and the power available to the turbine was estimated. It was found that, at higher wind speeds, the temperatures along the collector and along the chimney height drop a little; however, the air velocity and available power increase.

An implicit solution procedure (SIP-semi implicit procedure) as an alternative to a direct solution procedure for the calculation of the flow field on nonstaggered grids is investigated, presented and evaluated in this study. The Rhie and Chow interpolation practice was employed with the pressurecorrection equation to eliminate the presence of pressure oscillations on nonstaggered grids. The computer code for the solution of the three-dimensional thermo-flow fields is developed in FORTRAN 77. The code is evaluated against simple test cases for which analytical and experimental results exist.

Research within the South African context and particularly on increasing the effectiveness of the <b>solar</b> <b>chimney</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> technology is lacking; as such this study proposes the development of a solar chimney plant and associated technology to ensure the effectiveness of this plant...|$|E
40|$|Solar chimney {{thermal power}} {{technology}} {{that has a}} long life span is a promising large-scale solar power generating technology. This paper performs economic analysis of power generation from floating <b>solar</b> <b>chimney</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> (FSCPP) by analyzing cash flows during the whole service period of a 100 Â MW plant. Cash flows are influenced by many factors including investment, operation and maintenance cost, life span, payback period, inflation rate, minimum attractive rate of return, non-returnable subsidy rate, interest rate of loans, sale price of electricity, income tax rate and whether additional revenue generated by carbon credits is included or not. Financial incentives and additional revenue generated by carbon credits can accelerate {{the development of the}} FSCPP. Sensitivity analysis {{to examine the effects of}} the factors on cash flows of a 100 Â MW FSCPP is performed in detail. The results show that the minimum price for obtaining minimum attractive rate of return (MARR) of 8 % reaches 0. 83 Â yuanÂ (kWh) - 1 under financial incentives including loans at a low interest rate of 2 % and free income tax. Comparisons of economics of the FSCPP and reinforced concrete <b>solar</b> <b>chimney</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> or solar photovoltaic plant are also performed by analyzing their cash flows. It is concluded that FSCPP is in reality more economical than reinforced concrete <b>solar</b> <b>chimney</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> (RCSCPP) or solar photovoltaic plant (SPVP) with the same power capacity.

40|$|A <b>solar</b> <b>chimney</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> {{consists}} of four main parts, a solar collector, a chimney, an energy storage layer, and a wind turbine. So far, several investigations {{on the performance of}} the <b>solar</b> <b>chimney</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> have been conducted. Among them, different approaches have been applied to model the turbine inside the system. In particular, a real wind turbine coupled to the system was simulated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in three investigations. Gholamalizadeh et al. simulated a wind turbine with the same blade profile as the Manzanares SCPP’s turbine (FX W- 151 -A blade profile), while a CLARK Y blade profile was modelled by Guo et al. and Ming et al. In this study, simulations of the Manzanares prototype were carried out using the CFD model developed by Gholamalizadeh et al. Then, results obtained by modelling different turbine blade profiles at different turbine rotational speeds were compared. The results showed that a turbine with the CLARK Y blade profile significantly overestimates the value of the pressure drop across the Manzanares prototype turbine as compared to the FX W- 151 -A blade profile. In addition, modelling of both blade profiles led to very similar trends in changes in turbine efficiency and power output with respect to rotational speed...|$|E

40|$|A {{floating}} <b>solar</b> <b>chimney</b> <b>power</b> station (FSCPS) {{has three}} major components: A circular solar collector A floating <b>solar</b> <b>chimney</b> {{in the center}} of the solar collector A set of air turbines geared to electric generators around the bottom of the <b>solar</b> <b>chimney</b> The efficiency of the FSCPSs is roughly proportional to the height of their floating <b>solar</b> <b>chimneys.</b> The floating <b>solar</b> <b>chimneys</b> (FSCs) are made by successive balloon tubes, that are filled with He or NH 3. This permits to the FSCs to float in the air and thus to have heights a few Kms. In the present paper the effect on the FSCPS's operation of the thermal storage, due to ground or water in plastic bags or closed plastic tubes, is examined. It is shown that the FSCPSs equipped with thermal storage can operate 24 hours per day 365 days per year with a minimum guaranteed power production. This means that the FSCPSs, although renewable by nature, have a similar operation to conventional power stations. Large FSCPSs (above 20 MW) can be very cost competitive to any conventional power station due to their low construction, maintenance and operation costs...|$|R
