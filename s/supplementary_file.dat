5000|$|The {{purpose of}} Technometrics is to {{contribute}} to the development and use of statistical methods in physical, chemical, and engineering sciences as well as information sciences and technology. This vision includes developments on the interface of statistics and computer science such as data mining, machine learning, large databases, and so on. The journal places a premium on clear communication among statisticians and practitioners of these sciences and an emphasis on the application of statistical concepts and methods to problems that occur in these fields. The journal will publish papers describing new statistical techniques, papers illustrating innovative application of known statistical methods, expository papers on particular statistical methods, and papers dealing with the philosophy and problems of applying statistical methods, when such papers are consistent with the journal's objective. Every article shall include adequate justification of the application of the technique, preferably by means of an actual application to a problem in the physical, chemical, engineering or information sciences. All papers must contain a short, clear summary of contents and conclusions. Mathematical derivations not essential to the flow of the text should be placed in an appendix or a <b>supplementary</b> <b>file.</b> Brief descriptions of problems requiring solution and short technical notes that clearly pertain to the journal's purpose will also be considered for publication. Concise letters to the editor will be published when they are considered timely and appropriate.|$|E

40|$|International audienceOregon State University's ScholarsArchive@OSU {{institutional}} repository contains over 26, 000 undergraduate, masters, {{and doctoral}} level theses and dissertations published from 1902 to the present. Increasingly, these electronic theses and dissertations have multiple <b>supplementary</b> <b>files</b> {{associated with them}} including datasets and software code. In addition, deposit of faculty research articles that build on the research contained in ETDs and supplementary datasets is becoming increasingly common. In our current repository, supplementary data and related content files for ETDs are co-located with the thesis document without regard for representation of the relationships among file types or differentiation {{in the description of}} files. The metadata primarily describes the thesis document (PDF) but does not adequately describe the accompanying <b>supplementary</b> <b>files</b> and related documents. This creates a problem for reporting, description, discovery, and reuse of those <b>supplementary</b> <b>files</b> and for contextualizing the research contained in the ETD with other content in the repository. In 2015, Oregon State University Libraries and Press (OSULP) began to migrate the ScholarsArchive@OSU institutional repository from DSpace to the Hydra-Sufia platform. The selection of the Hydra-Sufia repository platform, which takes advantage of the Portland Common Data Model (PCDM), provides the library with an opportunity to represent the intellectual and structural relationships among distinct but related files (ETDs, appendices, datasets, presentations, papers, external resources, etc.). This paper describes and demonstrates OSULP's prototype repository architecture that explicitly defines relationships between ETDs and their <b>supplementary</b> <b>files</b> and datasets. We demonstrate the benefits of describing individual files as primary objects in the repository and using PCDM to contextualize the file in relationship with other resources in the repository. We provide concrete examples of how this architectural migration improves the representation of repository content to end-users. Last, we will demonstrate that this data model allows us to improve the discovery, and facilitate the publication, of datasets...|$|R

The current article contains flowcharts of the different scenarios. Additionally, six <b>supplementary</b> <b>files</b> including inventory data on the different scenarios, data on the different damage assessment categories, normalization, and single scores are presented (<b>Supplementary</b> <b>files</b> 1 – 6).
