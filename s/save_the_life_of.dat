5|$|In ancient Athens, {{a person}} who {{committed}} suicide without {{the approval of the}} state was denied the honors of a normal burial. The person would be buried alone, {{on the outskirts of the}} city, without a headstone or marker. However, it was deemed to be an acceptable method to deal with military defeat. In Ancient Rome, while suicide was initially permitted, it was later deemed a crime against the state due to its economic costs. Aristotle condemned all forms of suicide while Plato was ambivalent. In Rome some reasons for suicide include volunteering death in a gladiator combat, guilt over murdering someone, to <b>save</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>of</b> another, as a result of mourning, from shame from being raped, as an escape from intolerable situations like physical suffering, military defeat, or criminal pursuit.|$|E
