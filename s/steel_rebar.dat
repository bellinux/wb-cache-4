40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{summarizes}} {{an investigation}} undertaken {{to study the}} bond characteristics of Micro-composite Multi-structural Formable reinforcing <b>steel</b> <b>rebars,</b> commercially known as MMFX, with concrete. The objective of the investigation {{is to examine the}} applicability of the current equation of the ACI 318 - 02 Code on bond to predict the bond capacity of the MMFX <b>steel</b> <b>rebars.</b> The experimental program consisted of testing eight beam-splice specimens reinforced with MMFX <b>steel</b> <b>rebars.</b> The bond behaviour of the MMFX <b>steel</b> <b>rebars</b> was found to be similar to that of conventional Grade 420 MPa (60 ksi) steel up to the proportional limit of 550 MPa (80 ksi). The bond strength of the MMFX significantly changes as the tensile stresses developed in the rebar exceed the proportional limit. Therefore, test results indicated that the current ACI 318 - 02 Code equation on bond is adequate and resulted in conservative prediction at low stress levels. However, at high stress levels, the prediction is unconservative due to the nonlinear behaviour of MMFX stress-strain curve. This paper proposes a modification to the ACI 318 - 02 Code equation, using same format, to predict the bond forces beyond the proportional limit for MMFX <b>steel</b> <b>rebars...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to investigate the influence of FRP confinement on the buckling behavior of longitudinal <b>steel</b> reinforcing bars (<b>rebars)</b> in RC columns subjected to monotonic and cyclic axial compression. Test results of 12 FRP-confined RC columns and 12 FRP-confined plain concrete columns (control specimens) are presented with particular attention to the evolution of strains in the longitudinal <b>steel</b> <b>rebars</b> and the FRP jacket as the load increases. For an FRP-confined RC column subjected to monotonic axial compression, the contribution of longitudinal <b>steel</b> <b>rebars</b> to the overall axial load carried by the column was deduced by subtracting the contribution of the FRP-confined plain concrete from the total axial load. The test results showed that the compressive stress-strain response of longitudinal <b>steel</b> <b>rebars</b> in FRP-confined RC columns follows that from tensile testing before the axial stress reduces gradually due to the onset of buckling deformation. Significant interactions were found to exist between FRP confinement and the buckling of longitudinal <b>steel</b> <b>rebars.</b> This interaction should be carefully considered when formulating constitutive laws for both the longitudinal <b>steel</b> <b>rebars</b> and the FRP-confined concrete for use in theoretical modeling.

25|$|In wet {{and cold}} climates, {{reinforced}} concrete for roads, bridges, parking structures and other structures {{that may be}} exposed to deicing salt may benefit from use of corrosion-resistant reinforcement such as uncoated, low carbon/chromium (micro composite), epoxy-coated, hot dip galvanised or stainless <b>steel</b> <b>rebar.</b> Good design and a well-chosen concrete mix will provide additional protection for many applications. Uncoated, low carbon/chromium rebar looks similar to standard carbon <b>steel</b> <b>rebar</b> due to its lack of a coating; its highly corrosion-resistant features are inherent in the steel microstructure. It can be identified by the unique ASTM specified mill marking on its smooth, dark charcoal finish. Epoxy coated rebar can easily be identified by the light green colour of its epoxy coating. Hot dip galvanized rebar may be bright or dull grey depending on length of exposure, and stainless rebar exhibits a typical white metallic sheen that is readily distinguishable from carbon steel reinforcing bar.

25|$|Passivation is {{primarily}} determined by metallurgical and environmental factors. The effect of pH is summarized using Pourbaix diagrams, {{but many other}} factors are influential. Some conditions that inhibit passivation include high pH for aluminium and zinc, low pH or the presence of chloride ions for stainless steel, high temperature for titanium (in which case the oxide dissolves into the metal, rather than the electrolyte) and fluoride ions for silicon. On the other hand, unusual conditions may result in passivation of materials that are normally unprotected, as the alkaline environment of concrete does for <b>steel</b> <b>rebar.</b> Exposure to a liquid metal such as mercury or hot solder can often circumvent passivation mechanisms.|$|E

By the time the “conventional facility” (the shell for the laser) was complete in 2001, more than 210,000 cubic yards of soil had been excavated, more than 73,000 cubic yards of concrete had been poured, 7,600 tons of reinforcing <b>steel</b> <b>rebar</b> had been placed, and more than 5,000 tons of structural steel had been erected. In addition to its sheer size, building NIF presented a number of unique challenges. To isolate the laser system from vibration, the foundation of each laser bay was made independent {{of the rest of}} the structure. Three-foot-thick, 420-foot-long and 80-foot-wide slabs, each containing 3,800 cubic yards of concrete, required continuous concrete pours to achieve their specifications.|$|E
25|$|The {{material}} properties of FRP or GRP bars differ markedly from steel, {{so there are}} differences in the design considerations. FRP or GRP bars have relatively higher tensile strength but lower stiffness, so that deflections are likely to be higher than for equivalent steel-reinforced units. Structures with internal FRP reinforcement typically have an elastic deformability comparable to the plastic deformability (ductility) of steel reinforced structures. Failure in either case is more likely to occur by compression of the concrete than by rupture of the reinforcement. Deflection is always a major design consideration for reinforced concrete. Deflection limits are set to ensure that crack widths in steel-reinforced concrete are controlled to prevent water, air or other aggressive substances reaching the steel and causing corrosion. For FRP-reinforced concrete, aesthetics and possibly water-tightness will be the limiting criteria for crack width control. FRP rods also have relatively lower compressive strengths than <b>steel</b> <b>rebar,</b> and accordingly require different design approaches for reinforced concrete columns.|$|E

40|$|Corrosion of the {{embedded}} <b>steel</b> reinforcements (<b>rebars)</b> {{in concrete}} {{is the major}} reason for the deterioration of concrete structures. One of the effective methods of overcoming this serious problem is by applying a barrier coating to the <b>steel</b> <b>rebars.</b> The barrier coating on <b>steel</b> <b>rebars</b> isolates the <b>steel</b> from the immediate environment and also acts as an insulator to prevent the corrosion. Four different coatings have been formulated using resins such as epoxy silicone-polyamide, polyester polyol-aromatic isocyanate, and acrylic polyol-aromatic isocyanate.

The performance against atmospheric corrosion of the aforementioned <b>steel</b> <b>rebars</b> was evaluated by means of microscopy techniques and corrosion rate measurements. In particular, we studied the influence of corrosion products of a set of reinforcement steels on the bond strength between concrete and steel bars, during the hydration process of cement. Furthermore, microscopy techniques. and visual observation were used to identify the rust strains and the corrosion product morphology of steel reinforcements before their installation into the concrete. The experimental results shown that the steel type, which exhibits the higher resistance. as far as atmospheric corrosion concerns, was S 220 reinforcing steel. In contrary, S 500 s Tempcore has the least corrosion resistance. The bond strength between concrete and the <b>steel</b> <b>rebars</b> was found to decrease with increasing weathering from 45 to 122 days. due to the morphology and to the thickness of the rust layers formed on steel surface, as observed by the ESEM.
