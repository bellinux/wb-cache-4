5|$|In the 1996–97 season, Sakic only {{played in}} 65 games {{due to a}} lacerated calf, yet still managed to score 74 points as the Avalanche earned their first Presidents' Trophy and third {{straight}} division title. He had another great playoff season with eight goals and 17 assists, and took the Avalanche {{all the way to}} the conference finals, where they eventually lost to the Detroit Red Wings in six games. As a free agent during the summer of 1997, Sakic signed a three-year, $21 million offer <b>sheet</b> <b>with</b> the New York Rangers as a restricted free agent. Under the collective bargaining agreement at the time, the Avalanche had one week to match the Rangers' offer or let go of Sakic. Colorado would match the offer, which instigated a salary raise for many NHL players.|$|E
5|$|When the NHL lockout {{ended and}} play resumed for the 2005–06 NHL season, Kesler joined the Canucks {{for his first}} full season with the team, playing in all 82 games and {{finishing}} the season with 23 points. With his entry-level contract expiring in the off-season, Kesler rejected a $564,000 qualifying offer from the Canucks before becoming a restricted free agent on July 1, 2006. Unable {{to come to terms}} on a new deal with the Canucks, Kesler signed a one-year, $1.9-million offer <b>sheet</b> <b>with</b> the Philadelphia Flyers on September 12. The offer sheet from Flyers general manager Bobby Clarke was the first in the NHL since the Tampa Bay Lightning extended one to Brett Hauer in July 1999. The move was highly controversial with many NHL general managers criticizing how Kesler's inflated salary would affect future free agent signings. The Canucks had one week to either match the offer or receive a second round draft pick from the Flyers in 2007 as compensation. Two days after the signing, the Canucks matched the Flyers' offer.|$|E

25|$|The first {{postage stamp}} {{issued by the}} Confederate States (1861) was a 5¢ green {{depicting}} Jefferson Davis. It was printed by the lithograph process by Hoyer and Ludwig of Richmond, Virginia.

25|$|The first postage stamp, the Penny Black, {{was issued}} by Britain in May 1840 and pictured a young Queen Victoria.

30|$|FRP anchors {{significantly}} improved {{the performance of}} the anchored and bonded FRP system over bonded-only sheets. A comparison in behavior between bonded sheets and bonded <b>sheets</b> <b>with</b> supplemental FRP anchors tested by Niemitz et al. (2010) and McGuirk and Breña (2012) revealed increases in peak load that varied depending on number of anchors and pattern. Single ply <b>sheets</b> <b>with</b> two anchors achieved increases between 155 and 182  % relative to systems relying solely on bonding. Single ply <b>sheets</b> <b>with</b> four anchors were able to develop up to 224  % higher load than the bonded companion specimens. Double ply systems with two and four anchors developed up to 273 and 366  % increases, respectively, relative to the companion bonded specimens.|$|R
