5000|$|<b>Serotinal</b> (late summer): Generally begins {{mid to late}} August. Deciduous leaves {{begin to}} change color. Young birds reach {{maturity}} and join other adult birds preparing for autumn migration. The traditional [...] "harvest season" [...] begins.|$|E
50|$|In {{temperate}} and subpolar regions, four calendar-based seasons {{are generally}} recognized: spring, summer, autumn or fall, and winter. Ecologists often use a six-season model for temperate climate regions: prevernal, vernal, estival, <b>serotinal,</b> autumnal, and hibernal. Many tropical regions have two seasons: the rainy, wet, or monsoon {{season and the}} dry season. Some have a third cool, mild, or harmattan season. Seasons often held special significance for agrarian societies, whose lives revolved around planting and harvest times, and the change of seasons was often attended by ritual.|$|E
5000|$|Ecological {{reckoning}} {{of winter}} differs from calendar-based by avoiding {{the use of}} fixed dates. It is one of six seasons recognized by most ecologists who customarily use the term hibernal for this period of the year (the other ecological seasons being prevernal, vernal, estival, <b>serotinal,</b> and autumnal). [...] The hibernal season coincides with the main period of biological dormancy each year whose dates vary according to local and regional climates in temperate zones of the Earth. The appearance of flowering plants like the crocus can mark the change from ecological winter to the prevernal season as early as late January in mild temperate climates.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{provides}} {{the results of}} the ecological research conducted on the avifauna of the reservoirs located in the middle valley of the Arges River during the <b>serotinal</b> season. The <b>serotinal</b> season was one of the richest in species (we identified 169 species belonging to 15 orders, 45 families and 99 genera) as it is the season when the autumn agglomeration specific to migration is formed; 66 species are dependent on wetlands. We also performed an analysis of the avifauna based on ecological indices ((IR, constancy, dominancy, the Dzuba index of ecological significance, etc.). The Anseriformes, Passeriformes and Charadriiformes were overdominant. According to the dominance index and the Dzuba index of ecological significance, there were 5 characteristic species (eudominant and dominant) : Anas platyrhynchos, Aythya ferina, Fulica atra, Phalacrocorax carbo and Larus ridibundus. The high number of subrecedent species (122 species) emphasizes a high fluctuation of bird species in the area under research, especially on the Goleşti Lake, also {{due to the fact that}} these lakes are on the route of the Rucăr-Bran migration corridor. We also notice in the <b>serotinal</b> season (as well as in the hiemal and prevernal seasons) the great importance of the reservoirs for birds. These reservoirs are immense stretches of water, whose value should be considered in correlation with their large valleys, where there are various agricultural crops and large areas of forest. This high habitat heterogeneity explains the presence of a high number of bird species during migration, even though there is a strong anthropogenic influence in the area under research. 33 species are enlisted in Annex 1 of the Birds Directive...|$|E
