40|$|Most {{mergers and}} {{acquisitions}} involve at least four parties with competing interests — acquiring firm shareholders, acquiring firm management, target firm shareholders, and target firm management. We consider the choice between hostile and friendly takeovers in this context and offer {{an explanation for the}} prevalence of friendly mergers between large acquirers and small targets. Negotiated mergers, by virtue of the ability to make side payments to the target managers, allow the target manager to be better compensated for his loss of private benefits while simultaneously mitigating the agency conflict in the bidder firm. The direct cost of the side payment is borne by the target shareholders, but they benefit indirectly from the bidding manager having an increased incentive to investigate takeover targets. Target shareholders, therefore, accept the lower payoffs in a negotiated merger to increase the odds that a merger occurs. When the private benefits accruing to the bidding manager are correlated with size, bidder <b>shareholders</b> <b>grant</b> the manager relative autonomy in negotiating small mergers and monitor large mergers more closely. This induces the bidding manager to prefer to expend resources investigating small targets. The model generates specific predictions about the relation between principal-agent conflicts of both the bidder and the target firm and the division of gains from mergers...|$|R

Shareholder bylaws that set general rules of corporate governance and procedure should be valid unless more specific statutory provisions remove a specific matter from the bylaw power. Applied to poison pill and proxy access bylaws, both are valid under the general analysis, although poison pill bylaws may not be valid due to a more specific provision of Delaware law. The SEC should require boards to include bylaw proposals unless the particular proposal is clearly invalid under relevant state law.

40|$|Provisions in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 {{have made}} it much easier for firms to avoid federal {{periodic}} disclosure obligations, but these provisions were enacted based upon a virtually nonexistent legislative record and upended rules established only after careful consideration almost fifty years earlier. Determining when firms {{should be required to}} comply with federal periodic disclosure requirements is best done {{in the context of a}} broader understanding of the history and economics of periodic disclosure regulation.

The history of periodic disclosure regulation in the United States is traced back to its origins in the eighteenth century, and the economic analysis of periodic disclosure regulation is updated and refined to incorporate recent findings. Building on this historical and economic understanding of periodic disclosure regulation, I identify a flaw in the underlying structure of the rules currently used to determine when firms must make periodic disclosures. To rectify this structural problem, I conclude that firms with a market capitalization of less than $ 35 million or fewer than one hundred beneficial <b>shareholders</b> should be <b>granted</b> an automatic exemption from periodic disclosure requirements. All other firms should be provided a choice between: (1) complying with federal periodic disclosure obligations, or (2) implementing measures that would mitigate the need for periodic disclosure regulation, such as severely restricting the tradability of the firm’s shares or committing to an acceptable alternative disclosure regime...|$|R

It billed itself as [...] "The People Company", a title which was especially espoused by its CEO, Ferris Boyle, belying his true corrupt nature. One of GothCorp's employees, Victor Fries, pursued {{a project to}} develop cryogenic freezing technology. This was not only done for the company's sake: Fries hoped to preserve (and eventually cure) his terminally ill wife, Nora. Just as he was making progress, however, even having successfully put his wife in suspended animation, Boyle decided that the project was taking {{too much of the}} company's resources, and attempted to pull the plug. Determined to save his wife, Victor tried to stop him; in the ensuing struggle, the lab was destroyed. Victor was bathed in some of its chemicals, presumed dead. Victor later resurfaced as Mister Freeze, determined to have his revenge on Boyle. He launched a series of raids on GothCorp facilities, stealing several pieces of hardware that, put together, could be modified into what amounted to a gigantic freezing cannon. Batman was ultimately able to thwart his attempt, subdue Freeze, and save Boyle's life. However, his own investigation into the incident led him to the shocking facts of Boyle's betrayal, which he presented to the press. Though it is not shown what became of Boyle, it can be safely assumed that his reputation was irredeemably tarnished by the revelation.

40|$|The {{shareholder}} primacy norm {{defines the}} objective of the corporation as maximization of shareholder wealth. Law and economics scholars have incorporated the shareholder primacy norm into their empirical analyses of regulatory efficiency. An increasingly influential body of scholarship uses empirical methodology to evaluate legal rules that allocate power within the corporation. By embracing the shareholder primacy norm, empirical scholars offer normative assessments about regulatory choices based on the effect of legal rules on measures of shareholder value such as stock price, net profits, and Tobin’s Q. This Article challenges the foundations of using the shareholder primacy norm to judge corporate law. As this Article explains, existing legal doctrine and economic theory provide only limited support for shareholder primacy. Similarly, shareholder primacy cannot be justified as a necessary consequence of existing limits on the enforcement of management fiduciary duties. This Article demonstrates that, rather than defining the corporation’s objectives, the limited scope of a fiduciary duty claim provides a mechanism for institutional specialization in responding to the needs of different corporate stakeholders. Comparative institutional analysis suggests that the courts are uniquely positioned to protect the interests of shareholders in the context of inter-stakeholder conflicts. Implementation of this role through rules that <b>grant</b> <b>shareholders</b> a unique degree of judicial access does not privilege the interests of shareholders in the evaluation of firm value. The presence of other stakeholders, whose interests in the firm may not be reflected in an assessment of shareholder value, offers reasons to question the conclusions of existing empirical research. In addition, the measures of shareholder value typically employed by empirical scholars—particularly short-term stock price—are problematic as indicators of firm value and may reinforce inappropriate managerial decisions. This Article maintains that empirical scholars need to offer better and explicit justifications for their reliance on shareholder wealth and, more importantly, for their argument that shareholder wealth effects should dominate regulatory policy...|$|R
40|$|The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 {{mandated}} {{a number}} of regulatory reforms including a requirement that large U. S. public companies provide their shareholders {{with the opportunity to}} cast a non-binding vote on executive compensation. The “say on pay” vote was designed to rein in excessive levels of executive compensation and to encourage boards to adopt compensation structures that tie executive pay more closely to performance. Although the literature is mixed, many studies question whether the statute has had the desired effect. Shareholders at most companies overwhelmingly approve the compensation packages, and pay levels continue to be high. Although a lack of shareholder support for executive compensation is relatively rare, say on pay votes at {{a number of}} companies have reflected low levels of shareholder support. A critical question is what factors drive a low say on pay vote. In other words, is say on pay only about pay? In this article, we examine that question by looking at the effect of three factors on voting outcomes [...] pay level, sensitivity of pay to performance, and economic performance. Our key finding is the importance of economic performance to say on pay outcomes. Although pay-related variables affect the shareholder vote, even after we control for those variables, an issuer’s economic performance has a substantial effect and, perhaps most significantly, shareholders do not appear to care about executive compensation unless an issuer is performing badly. In other words, the say on pay vote is, to a large extent, say on performance. This finding has important implications. First, it raises questions about the federally-mandated shareholder voting right as a tool for concerns about executive compensation. Say on pay has limited effectiveness if it is only being used to discipline managers who are underperforming or alternatively is not a vote on outsize or inordinate pay as it was intended to be. Second, and more important, {{to the extent that the}} shareholder vote influences board behavior, <b>granting</b> <b>shareholders</b> another forum for signaling their dissatisfaction with a firm’s economic performance may be counterproductive. If investors are signaling concerns over near-term stock performance through their say on pay votes, they may be increasing director incentives to focus on short-term stock performance rather than firm value...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of “majority rule” {{within the company}} {{has the potential to}} lead to unfair results either for the minority shareholders or for the company itself, hence, it is the task of the legislature to provide minority shareholders with a matrix of rules that seek to protect them from misguided managerial behaviour. In that regard, this thesis set out to examine to what extent the Libyan shareholder protection regime offers equivalent protection to that found in the English and Moroccan corporate law regimes. It evaluates the current level of protection that is offered to minority shareholders in Libya in comparison with that available in England and Morocco in order to participate in a reform programme aimed at establishing a sufficient system of corporate governance in Libya via enhancing the rules that protect the minority shareholder. The reliance on a comparative study in this thesis is based on an assumption that law should be assessed from a wide perspective and the experience of other jurisdictions should be taken into account in order to reform the current law by establishing a high standard level of protection for the minority shareholders. Such reform would <b>grant</b> <b>shareholders</b> a degree of confidence which is considered a necessary step to attract investments and develop the economic strength of the whole country. The conclusion of this work reveals several weaknesses and serious shortcoming in the Libyan corporate law regime, thereby it provides a basis for suggestions on how to improve minority shareholder protection in Libya based on the English and Moroccan experience. In that process, some suggestions and recommendations are provided which is the purpose of this work and the hope is that they will be taken on board in any proposal for reform in Libya. The study recommends a reform in the existing rules of minority shareholder protection in order to create an effective system of safeguards for the minority shareholders. Such reforms promise domestic and foreign investors that all companies under Libyan laws are managed, directed and controlled by upright, truthful, honest and efficient managers. This work will also pave the way for further studies that might be conducted in order to further enhance a robust system of corporate governance in Libya which would contribute to the growth of the national economy...|$|R
40|$|Part I of the Article {{outlines}} {{the problems with}} the current method of board selection and functioning. Management or management-sympathetic board members often select the board nominees, who share social ties with other board members. Boards tend to avoid 2 ̆ 2 rocking the boat 2 ̆ 2 by questioning management 2 ̆ 7 s recommendations, and {{because of the way the}} proxy process is structured, shareholders cannot effectively use their votes to oust unsatisfactory board members. Part II analyzes the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s recent proposals for reform, which center on <b>granting</b> <b>shareholders</b> more opportunities to nominate candidates to the board. These proposals attempt to give shareholders a greater voice in the election process, but do so circuitously. They require that nominating shareholders be independent from the candidates they nominate, missing the point that it is precisely those individuals with a stake in the corporation that will make the best monitors. Part III presents the mechanics of the proposed solution, suggesting that the company offer the largest shareholder independent of management a spot on the company 2 ̆ 7 s slate of director candidates (an offer tantamount to a board seat, given the structure of the proxy process). If the largest such shareholder did not accept the position, it would be offered to the next-largest shareholder, and so on until the seat was filled. Because adoption of such a nomination process would be voluntary, only companies that strongly desired to signal their status as upstanding practitioners of responsible corporate governance would be likely to implement it. The Part concludes by pointing out that in the venture capital context, investors routinely sit on the board in order to monitor and protect their investments. Part IV then explains how having a shareholder representative on the board solves many of the problems that other proposed reforms do not. Part IV responds to potential criticisms, chief among which is that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other corporate reforms render further action unnecessary. The Article 2 ̆ 7 s response is that regulators, like generals, always fight the last war. Sarbanes-Oxley, and the new listing rules instituted by NASDAQ and the NYSE, prohibit Enron- and WorldCom style problems, such as loans to corporate officers, off-balance sheet transactions, and conflicts of interest in company auditors. None of these reforms contemplate structural changes that will prevent new kinds of frauds in the future. The Article concludes that it makes sense to let corporations, and therefore the market, decide whether putting a shareholder on the board is desirable...|$|R
40|$|I study {{executive}} compensation in various situations, including the cases where (i) CEOs have relative wealth concerns (RWCs); (ii) inside debt {{can be a}} part of an optimal contract; (iii) there are ambiguous information about firm value. ^ The first chapter, 2 ̆ 2 Relative Wealth Concerns and Executive compensation 2 ̆ 2, studies the implications of RWCs on {{executive compensation}}. I first study the case in which a CEO 2 ̆ 7 s effort increases firm value without changing firm risk. In this case, RWCs will result in an increase in CEO incentives. This effect is larger if aggregate risk is higher, so RWCs can lead to a positive relation between CEO incentives and aggregate risk. CEOs with RWCs willingly risk exposure to aggregate shock to keep up with their peers. This help to reduce risk premium paid to the CEOs. As a result, RWCs can be beneficial to shareholders 2 ̆ 7 payoffs. I also provide a simple explanation for the pay-for-luck puzzle. I next examine the case in which the CEO 2 ̆ 7 s effort affects both the mean and variance of firm value. I show that RWCs can lead to a negative relation between CEOs 2 ̆ 7 risk-taking behavior and their incentives, which is consistent with some empirical evidence. Lastly, I show that RWCs render options preferable to stock where aggregate risk is much larger than idiosyncratic risk. ^ The second chapter, 2 ̆ 2 Inside Debt 2 ̆ 2, is a coauthored paper with my advisor Alex Edmans. We justify the use of debt as efficient compensation. We show that inside debt is a superior solution to the agency costs of debt than the solvency-contingent bonuses proposed by prior literature, since its payoff depends not only on the incidence of bankruptcy but also firm value in bankruptcy. Contrary to intuition, granting the manager equal proportions of debt and equity is typically inefficient. The optimal ratio depends on the trade off of the importance between project selection and effort. The model generates a number of empirical predictions consistent with recent evidence. ^ In the last chapter, 2 ̆ 2 Incentive Contracting under Ambiguity-Aversion 2 ̆ 2, I study the effect of ambiguity on the pay structure of executive compensation. I show that when there is ambiguity in firm risk and if a manager is risk-averse and ambiguity-averse, stock-based contracts always impose a high risk premium. But option-based contracts can induce the manager to perceive a low risk and thus pay a low risk premium, which makes options less costly than stock. I also show that a manager tends to perceive a higher risk when she is granted higher incentives, which makes <b>shareholders</b> reluctant to <b>grant</b> managers high incentives and take advantage of some small improvements. As a result, compensation contracts exhibit an inertia property. Lastly, if ambiguity comes from the expected market returns, tying CEO pay to the market is optimal, which provides an explanation for the pay-for-luck puzzle. ...|$|R
40|$|The SEC {{recently}} adopted {{rules on}} proxy access. These rules <b>grant</b> <b>shareholders</b> who hold at least 3 % {{of the company}} stock for three years the right to nominate directors and to have their nominees included in the company’s proxy statement. Because proxy access is viewed as dramatically lowering the costs of an election contest, both proponents and opponents of these rules predict {{that they will have}} a significant impact. Contrary to this conventional wisdom, we argue that proxy access will lead to few shareholder nominations, that most of these nominees will be defeated, and that the occasional nominee who does get elected will have little impact. Based on past involvement in shareholder activism, we believe that neither mutual funds nor private pension funds will make significant use of proxy access. Certain large public pension funds have shown a modest interest in activism and may make some nominations. The entities with the greatest interests in activism [...] hedge funds and union-affiliated funds [...] will generally not satisfy the ownership and holding period requirements. When compared to traditional proxy contests and to withhold campaigns, proxy access involves significant disadvantages, while promising only modest advantages. The cost savings of proxy access compared to traditional contests are overstated because most proxy contests expenses are discretionary campaign expenses or relate to other expense items that are unaffected by the proxy access rule. By contrast, the limitations that come with proxy access are significant: the number of nominees a shareholder can propose is limited; the level of shareholder support required to gain a seat, as a practical matter, is increased; the company retains control over the design of the proxy cards; and the company retains exclusive access to preliminary voting information. When compared to withhold-vote campaigns, the more certain effect on board makeup and governance from a successful proxy access campaign must be weighed against countervailing factors that reduce the likelihood of success: the higher level of shareholder support required for success; the greater challenge of positive versus negative campaigning; and the vulnerability of the dissident shareholders and their nominees to attacks by the company for lack of qualification or conflicts of interest. Such attacks will resonate especially for nominees by unions and public pension funds. Their inability or unwillingness to defend against such attacks without incurring significant expense may make it difficult to find qualified nominees. Overall, we believe that proxy access will have some undesirable effects – it will result in some increase in company expenses and may, rarely, increase the leverage of shareholders whose interest conflict with those of shareholders at large – and some desirable ones [...] it may occasionally lead to the election of nominees at recalcitrant boards, where such nominees may have a modest impact on governance and a marginal impact on company value. None of these effects is likely to be very material, and the net effect is likely to be close to zero...|$|R
