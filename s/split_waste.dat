40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of numerical analysis of <b>splitting</b> without <b>waste</b> on the basis of cross wedge rolling in double rolling mechanism. The analysed process concerns rolling the charge of V-shaped groove, and rotary bending causing the split of the material. In the calculations a method of finite elements (FEM) was used. The obtained results allowed detailed analysis of the splitting process in terms of the level of deformation, strains, material breaking, flow kinematics and strength parameters...|$|R

Results show {{that it is possible to}} <b>split</b> features into <b>waste</b> disposal which included animal/human waste and those which probably did not.

30|$|Multiple studies, mostly {{based on}} iron oxide-based redox metal pairs have {{reported}} the conversion efficiencies and operating {{conditions for conversion}} of methane into syngas over metal oxides [26, 34, 45]. Such studies also include the limiting operation range based {{on the need to}} prevent carbon deposition reactions as crucial for the system operation. Thermodynamics of Ceria reduction with hydrogen have been investigated to explore the maximum extent of reaction and reported in the literature [28]. Solar-driven thermal reduction for ceria coupled with either CO 2 or H 2 O splitting has been studied extensively by Welte [41, 56] and other researchers [5, 43]. However, limited literature on the thermodynamic assessment regarding methane reduction of ceria followed by <b>splitting</b> of <b>waste</b> gas (a mixture of CO 2 and H 2 O) is available [27]. Additionally, the need to identify the regimes for carbon formation is crucial to ensure the suitable operation regimes of the reaction system further.|$|R
30|$|To {{avoid the}} {{deficiency}} in resolution of some EEIOA models, a reasonable approach {{could be to}} disaggregate products and sectors in more detailed categories. The new classification may contribute to monitor specific resource flows in a circular economy model (as shown by Choi et al. 2011; Li et al. 2013). However, disaggregating sectors in EEIOA presents a challenge by itself because sectoral data may not be available at the required level of detail. This is particularly the case in waste input–output frameworks, in which many studies show a limited dataset to <b>split</b> and link <b>waste</b> treatment sectors {{to the rest of}} the economy (Salemdeeb et al. 2016).|$|R
40|$|AbstractEnergy {{economics}} increasingly develop {{awareness of}} Efficiencies. From extraction through transformation, storage, distribution, etc. {{to the use}} of energy efficiency is topic. Some of it is addressed by going local in feedstock and distributed in generation, also opening new opportunities for energy use of biomass, usually limited to logistic constraints. Hydrogen recently has taken a prominent position in contributing towards flexibility of Renewable Energy generation and could potentially save a part of the 80 % crude oil energy loss for transformation into gasoline for the transportation sector. <b>Splitting</b> organic <b>waste</b> and biomass into Hydrogen and Carbon in a bio-refinery, flexible product outputs could be enabled, as demonstrated at the European Centre for Renewable Energies in Guessing, Austria. By applying our thermo catalytic splitting of Carbon Hydrate gases at 55 % of the energy needs of SMR only, no scarce water needs to be used nor CO 2 is generated. Bio refineries could uplift energy efficiency of biomass use, from today's limitation to electricity and heat to flexible synthetic fuels or electricity on demand, potentially providing economic back-up solutions for volatile renewable energy generation. A model for a 200. 000 capita MSW installation will be introduced...|$|R
40|$|Waste {{pollution}} {{is becoming an}} ever increased challenge and this is even more so the case in Indonesia. Landfills are notoriously overfilled which, together with little spatial opportunity for appropriate waste storage and separation on a local scale, {{as well as a}} lack of knowledge leads to a majority of waste being disposed of on road sides, rivers or burned openly. The project ‘crafting the disused’ focuses on waste flows and a proposal to support recycling by means of spatial facilities, encouraging the recycling of waste into new materials for the built environment on a decentralised scale. Using only local materials such as bamboo and the locally produced waste as construction material, the design is organised around the community with a self-built approach and as a means to facilitate future densification and enabling the local community to organise their own <b>waste</b> management. <b>Split</b> into a <b>waste</b> storage and recycling facility and a reprocessing facility, local inhabitants are encouraged to consider their approach to waste and furthermore to use this in a creative way, while also generating income for the neighbourhood by means of an integrated waste bank. Key of the project is to clear the current waste pollution and diminish the stigma of waste as something ‘unwanted’ but instead as a new material that can be shaped to desire...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this model report is to develop the summary {{cladding}} degradation abstraction {{that will be used}} in the Total System Performance Assessment for the License Application (TSPA-LA). Most civilian commercial nuclear fuel is encased in Zircaloy cladding. The model addressed in this report is intended to describe the postulated condition of commercial Zircaloy-clad fuel as a function of postclosure time after it is placed in the repository. Earlier total system performance assessments analyzed the waste form as exposed UO{sub 2 }, which was available for degradation at the intrinsic dissolution rate. Water in the waste package quickly became saturated with many of the radionuclides, limiting their release rate. In the total system performance assessments for the Viability Assessment and the Site Recommendation, cladding was analyzed as part of the waste form, limiting the amount of fuel available at any time for degradation. The current model is divided into two stages. The first considers predisposal rod failures (most of which occur during reactor operation and associated activities) and postdisposal mechanical failure (from static loading of rocks) as mechanisms for perforating the cladding. Other fuel failure mechanisms including those caused by handling or transportation have been screened out (excluded) or are treated elsewhere. All stainless-steel-clad fuel, which makes up {{a small percentage of the}} overall amount of fuel to be stored, is modeled as failed upon placement in the waste packages. The second stage of the degradation model is the splitting of the cladding from the reaction of water or moist air and UO{sub 2 }. The splitting has been observed to be rapid in comparison to the total system performance assessment time steps and is modeled to be instantaneous. After the cladding splits, the rind buildup inside the cladding widens the split, increasing the diffusion area from the fuel rind to the waste package interior. This model report summarizes the component models, developed for the two stages noted above, that are used as inputs to TSPA-LA. The model concludes that less than two percent of the fuel, including all of the stainless-steel clad fuel, received at the repository is failed (perforated) upon receipt at the repository. All failed fuel is assumed to axially <b>split</b> upon <b>waste</b> package failure exposing the fuel to oxidation from the in-package environment. TSPA-LA then calculates the release of radionuclides from the exposed volume of oxidized fuel...|$|R
40|$|Kerbside {{recycling}} in Australia {{has focused}} on paper, cardboard, plastics and bottles and in some areas green waste. Another area for potential kerbside recycling is organic waste. This study uses a dichotomous choice contingent valuation format with follow-up open-ended willingness to pay question to estimate the household willingness {{to pay for the}} introduction of a kerbside recycling scheme for kitchen waste. Two provision rules were used. The first sample split contained a majority decision rule while the second sample split contained a provision rule where participation is voluntary. Households across the Brisbane statistical sub-division currently pay in the order of $ 250 per annum for their kerbside waste collection scheme. This study indicates that on average Brisbane households would be WTP an additional $ 32 to $ 35 per year for a general waste bin where food <b>waste</b> is <b>split</b> from general <b>waste.</b> There {{was no significant difference in}} results between sample splits with majority or voluntary provision rules. Whether the provision of a food waste recycling scheme is economically efficient requires a consideration of all the potential costs and benefits. Other relevant costs and benefits for inclusion in a benefit cost analysis would include those associated with bin replacement, any additional collection and transport costs, composting costs, revenues from compost sales and avoided landfill costs. If a compulsory food waste recycling scheme could be provided to all households for less than $ 32 to $ 35 per household per annum then the benefits of the scheme would exceed the costs and would be considered to be economically efficient and desirable from a community welfare perspective. Given the difficulties of estimating precise WTP values from dichotomous choice data, any BCA of a compulsory scheme incorporating the results of this study should undertake sensitivity testing that includes the range of values reported including dichotomous choice and open-ended means to determine the robustness of BCA results to variations in the welfare estimate. Notwithstanding, the results of any BCA, decision-makers also need to be cognisant of the high proportion of respondents who did not support a kerbside food waste recycling scheme. The data from the study could also be used to undertake a BCA of a voluntary scheme. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to develop and analyze the {{engineered}} barrier system (EBS) radionuclide transport abstraction model, consistent with Level I and Level II model validation, as identified in Technical Work Plan for: Near-Field Environment and Transport: Engineered Barrier System: Radionuclide Transport Abstraction Model Report Integration (BSC 2005 [DIRS 173617]). The EBS radionuclide transport abstraction (or EBS RT Abstraction) is the conceptual model used in the total system performance assessment (TSPA) to determine the rate of radionuclide releases from the EBS to the unsaturated zone (UZ). The EBS RT Abstraction conceptual model consists of two main components: a flow model and a transport model. Both models are developed mathematically from first principles {{in order to show}} explicitly what assumptions, simplifications, and approximations are incorporated into the models used in the TSPA. The flow model defines the pathways for water flow in the EBS and specifies how the flow rate is computed in each pathway. Input to this model includes the seepage flux into a drift. The seepage flux is potentially split by the drip shield, with some (or all) of the flux being diverted by the drip shield and some passing through breaches in the drip shield that might result from corrosion or seismic damage. The flux through drip shield breaches is potentially <b>split</b> by the <b>waste</b> package, with some (or all) of the flux being diverted by the waste package and some passing through waste package breaches that might result from corrosion or seismic damage. Neither the drip shield nor the waste package survives an igneous intrusion, so the flux splitting submodel is not used in the igneous scenario class. The flow model is validated in an independent model validation technical review. The drip shield and <b>waste</b> package flux <b>splitting</b> algorithms are developed and validated using experimental data. The transport model considers advective transport and diffusive transport from a breached waste package. Advective transport occurs when radionuclides that are dissolved or sorbed onto colloids (or both) are carried from the waste package by the portion of the seepage flux that passes through waste package breaches. Diffusive transport occurs {{as a result of a}} gradient in radionuclide concentration and may take place while advective transport is also occurring, as well as when no advective transport is occurring. Diffusive transport is addressed in detail because it is the sole means of transport when there is no flow through a waste package, which may dominate during the regulatory compliance period in the nominal and seismic scenarios. The advective transport rate, when it occurs, is generally greater than the diffusive transport rate. Colloid-facilitated advective and diffusive transport is also modeled and is presented in detail in Appendix B of this report...|$|R
