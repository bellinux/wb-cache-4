40|$|The kink {{stability}} of self-similar solutions of a massless scalar field with circular symmetry in 2 + 1 gravity is studied, {{and found that}} such solutions are unstable against the kink perturbations along the <b>sonic</b> <b>line</b> (self-similar horizon). However, when perturbations outside the <b>sonic</b> <b>line</b> are considered, and taking the ones along the <b>sonic</b> <b>line</b> as their boundary conditions, we find that non-trivial perturbations do not exist. In other words, the consideration of perturbations outside the <b>sonic</b> <b>line</b> limits the unstable mode of the perturbations found along the <b>sonic</b> <b>line.</b> As a result, the critical solution for the scalar collapse remains critical even after the kink perturbations are taken into account.

40|$|The {{problem of}} kink {{stability}} of isothermal spherical self-similar flow in newtonian gravity is revisited. Using distribution theory we first develop a general formula of perturbations, linear or non-linear, {{which consists of}} three sets of differential equations, one in {{each side of the}} <b>sonic</b> <b>line</b> and the other along it. By solving the equations along the <b>sonic</b> <b>line</b> we find explicitly the spectrum, $k$, of the perturbations, whereby we obtain the stability criterion for the self-similar solutions. When the solutions are smoothly across the <b>sonic</b> <b>line,</b> our results reduce to those of Ori and Piran. To show such obtained perturbations can be matched to the ones in the regions outside the <b>sonic</b> <b>line,</b> we study the linear perturbations in the external region of the <b>sonic</b> <b>line</b> (the ones in the internal region are identically zero), by taking the solutions obtained along the line as the boundary conditions. After properly imposing other boundary conditions at spatial infinity, we are able to show that linear perturbations, satisfying all the boundary conditions, exist and do not impose any additional conditions on $k$. As a result, the complete treatment of perturbations in the whole spacetime does not alter the spectrum obtained by considering the perturbations only along the <b>sonic</b> <b>line.</b> Comment: latex file, including two figure...|$|E

The shapes of the <b>sonic</b> <b>line</b> and the shock wave are obtained by iteration techniques.

40|$|An {{approximate}} method, {{based on}} a simplified form of the con-tinuity relation, is developed to predict the location of detached shock waves ahead of two-dimensional and axially s_unmetric bodies. In {{order to reduce the}} problem to an equivalent one-dimensional form, it %_s assumed that: (1) The form of the shock between its foremost point and its sonic point is adequately represented by an hyperbola asymptotic to tile free-stream Mach lines; and (2) the <b>sonic</b> <b>line</b> between the shock and the body is straight and inclined at an angle that depends only on the free-stream Mach nn_ber. With these assumptions, the location of the shock relative to the body sonic point is independent of the form of the nose or leading edge ahead of the sonic point and becomes a single-valued function of the Mach rmmber. A simple geometric method for estimatir _ shock location is also presented, but this method agrees less closely with experiment than the continuity method. When the location of the detached wave and the <b>sonic</b> <b>line</b> relative to the body are known, the drag of the portion of the body upstream of its sonic point can be estimated from the momen-tum change of the fluid that crosses the <b>sonic</b> <b>line.</b> Comv_rison with available experimental results indicates t_mt the estimated drag coefficients are good approximations except for very blunt bodies and for free-stream Mach numbers close to 1. 0.

40|$|Same as Version 1. In {{preprint}} format. Some typo errors corrected. A rescaled matrix-valued dissipation is reformulated for the Roe {{scheme in}} low Mach-number flow regions from a well known family of local low-speed preconditioners popularized by Turkel. The rescaling is obtained by suppressing the iterative preconditioning and by deriving explicitly the {{full set of}} eigenspaces of the Roe-Turkel matrix dissipation.

The dissipation matrix achieves by construction the proper scaling in low-speed flow regions and returns the original Roe scheme at the <b>sonic</b> <b>line.</b> We find that all eigenvalues are nonnegative in the subsonic regime. By removing the iterative preconditioning, it becomes necessary to formulate a stringent stability condition to the explicit scheme in the low-speed flow regions based on the spectral radius of the rescaled matrix dissipation.
