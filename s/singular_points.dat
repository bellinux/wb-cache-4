25|$|This {{implies that}} the number of <b>singular</b> <b>points</b> is finite as long as p(x,y) or P(x,y,z) is square free. Bézout's theorem implies thus {{that the number of}} <b>singular</b> <b>points</b> is at most (d−1)2, but this bound is not sharp because the system of {{equations}} is overdetermined. If reducible polynomials are allowed, the sharp bound is d(d−1)/2, this value being reached when the polynomial factors in linear factors, that is if the curve is the union of d lines. For irreducible curves and polynomials, the number of <b>singular</b> <b>points</b> is at most (d−1)(d−2)/2, because of the formula expressing the genus in term of the singularities (see below). The maximum is reached by the curves of genus zero whose all singularities have multiplicity two and distinct tangents (see below).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A planar cam {{theoretical}} profile can {{be considered}} as cycloid of the roller center. There is <b>singular</b> <b>point</b> on the cycloid when the roller center is located on the instantaneous axis. Then, the curvature of the cycloid at the <b>singular</b> <b>point</b> is likely to be infinite and interference may be inevitable. Thus, avoiding such <b>singular</b> <b>point</b> is imperative in cam profile design. But, in analyzing the characteristics of the tangent vector and curvature at such <b>singular</b> <b>point,</b> it reveals that the curvature may be finite, even zero, if the cycloid fulfills some condition at the <b>singular</b> <b>point.</b> This leads to a very important property that at the <b>singular</b> <b>point</b> the tangent of the cycloid is parallel to the normal of the instantaneous center curve. The pressure angle is very small even zero. These results would be very efficacious in planar cam mechanism applications. The characteristics of <b>singular</b> <b>point</b> on cycloid are detailed in this paper. As application, a novel kind of parallel indexing cam mechanism is developed. Its configuration and principle are described...|$|R

In 3-manifold theory, the theory of Seifert fiber spaces, initiated by Seifert, can be phrased in terms of 2-dimensional orbifolds. In geometric group theory, post-Gromov, discrete groups have been studied in terms of the local curvature properties of orbihedra and their covering spaces.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{objects of}} study in algebraic geometry are algebraic varieties, which are geometric manifestations of solutions of systems of polynomial equations. Examples of the most studied classes of algebraic varieties are: plane algebraic curves, which include lines, circles, parabolas, ellipses, hyperbolas, cubic curves like elliptic curves and quartic curves like lemniscates, and Cassini ovals. A point of the plane belongs to an algebraic curve if its coordinates satisfy a given polynomial equation. Basic questions involve {{the study of the}} points of special interest like the <b>singular</b> <b>points,</b> the inflection points and the points at infinity.
