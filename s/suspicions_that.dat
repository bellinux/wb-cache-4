5|$|In 1974, {{there was}} a bomb {{explosion}} in the Mortar Room in the White Tower, leaving one person dead and 35injured. No one {{claimed responsibility for the}} blast, but the police investigated <b>suspicions</b> <b>that</b> the IRA was behind it.|$|E
5|$|Meinertzhargen {{had been}} {{banned from the}} Natural History Museum's Bird Room for 18months for {{unauthorised}} removal of specimens, and <b>suspicions</b> <b>that</b> he was stealing specimens and library material were documented by staff for over 30years, twice reaching the verge of prosecution.|$|E

5|$|Another sauropod of the Nemegt-Formation, Nemegtosaurus, {{is known}} {{only from a}} skull. Opisthocoelicaudia, on the other hand, lacks both the skull and neck, precluding a direct {{comparison}} and leading to <b>suspicions</b> <b>that</b> it may represent a synonym of Nemegtosaurus. According to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), the oldest name has priority over younger synonyms – if Opisthocoelicaudia would {{be shown to be}} a synonym of Nemegtosaurus, the name Nemegtosaurus would remain valid while Opisthocoelicaudia would become invalid.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{publication}} of Industrial Society and Its Future, Ted Kaczynski's brother, David Kaczynski, was encouraged by his wife Linda {{to follow up on}} <b>suspicions</b> <b>that</b> Ted was the Unabomber. David was at first dismissive, but began to take the likelihood more seriously after reading the manifesto a week after it was published in September 1995. He browsed through old family papers and found letters dating back to the 1970s written by Ted and sent to newspapers protesting the abuses of technology and which contained phrasing similar to that found in Industrial Society and Its Future.|$|E
5|$|Bessell {{noted that}} Thorpe, {{for all his}} gregariousness and warmth, {{appeared}} to have no female friends and lacked any interest in girls. The former Liberal MP Frank Owen confided to Bessell his <b>suspicions</b> <b>that</b> Thorpe was a homosexual; other West Country Liberals had formed the same opinion. Aware that exposure as a homosexual would end Thorpe's career, Bessell became his self-appointed protector, even to the extent, he later said, of falsely claiming to be bisexual, {{as a means of}} acquiring his friend's confidence.|$|E

5|$|Figures from WRAP {{revealed}} {{the most efficient}} method of collecting food waste to be separate collections, followed by mixed green and food waste on a weekly basis. A mixed fortnightly collection was shown {{to be the worst}} performing. This was considered confirmation of earlier <b>suspicions</b> <b>that,</b> if carried out correctly, separate collections can result in less wastage of biodegradable waste. A widespread pilot scheme for separate food waste collection, involving nineteen English local authorities, achieved success and 'high levels of satisfaction' from households.|$|E
5|$|Humanitarian {{workers and}} foreign {{military}} observers had <b>suspicions</b> <b>that</b> the Croats deliberately abandoned Jajce, {{as well as}} territories lost in Operation Corridor 92, to the VRS {{in exchange for the}} Prevlaka Peninsula south of Dubrovnik. Even though Croatia and several Western diplomats denied this claim, European Community envoy David Owen urged the UN to impose sanctions against Croatia. The suspicion was fueled by an October 1992 agreement between Croatian President Franjo Tuđman and Yugoslav President Dobrica Ćosić to withdraw the JNA from Prevlaka. However, the JNA withdrawal from Croatian soil had also {{been a part of the}} Vance plan, which was accepted by both Croatia and Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Chandler confronted {{his ex-wife}} June, who had custody of Jordan, with <b>suspicions</b> <b>that</b> their {{son had been}} in an {{inappropriate}} relationship with Jackson but June dismissed his worries. According to several sources, Chandler threatened {{to go public with}} the evidence he claimed he had on Jackson, who asked his lawyer Bert Fields to intervene. Chandler's lawyer, Barry K. Rothman, called psychiatrist Mathis Abrams and reported a situation of sexual molestation mirroring what his son had alleged.|$|E

5|$|Nasser's {{return to}} Egypt coincided with Husni al-Za'im's Syrian coup d'état. Its success and evident popular {{support among the}} Syrian people {{encouraged}} Nasser's revolutionary pursuits. Soon after his return, he was summoned and interrogated by Prime Minister Ibrahim Abdel Hadi regarding <b>suspicions</b> <b>that</b> he was forming a secret group of dissenting officers. According to secondhand reports, Nasser convincingly denied the allegations. Abdel Hadi was also hesitant to take drastic measures against the army, especially in front of its chief of staff, who was present during the interrogation, and subsequently released Nasser. The interrogation pushed Nasser to speed up his group's activities.|$|E
5|$|Salaam invites Ferris back to Jordan {{and shares}} his <b>suspicions</b> <b>that</b> Omar Sadiki is a terrorist, though Ferris feigns ignorance. Ferris later tries to save Sadiki from being kidnapped by Al-Saleem's henchmen but fails and sees his partner nearly {{killed in the}} {{subsequent}} car crash. Under interrogation, Sadiki denies any knowledge of the attack though he is later found beaten and killed. Ferris {{goes back to his}} apartment and finds out that Aisha has been kidnapped. He desperately asks Salaam for help, admitting he fabricated Omar Sadiki's terrorist cell and the attack. Salaam refuses to help because of Ferris earlier having lied to him.|$|E

Petrović wanted to dismiss Marić as commander of the 27th Infantry Division Savska due to <b>suspicions</b> <b>that</b> he was an Ustaše sympathiser, but could not identify a suitable replacement.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} international {{reaction was}} extremely critical of Lumumba. Lumumba's attack on colonialism was especially {{interpreted as an}} attack on Belgium itself and nearly provoked a diplomatic incident between the two countries. International observers though the speech unwise, ungrateful and tactless. The confrontational attitude taken by Lumumba appeared to confirm Belgian and American <b>suspicions</b> <b>that</b> Lumumba was a dangerous radical. Between September 1960 and January 1961, partly at the instigation of the two countries, Lumumba was deposed from power, arrested and executed with the complicity of both the Congolese and Katangese governments.|$|E
5|$|Erik and Ashley begin dating, but {{on their}} first date at a restaurant, Erik has hot soup spilled accidentally on his legs, so Ashley brings him to her room to clean up. As Ashley rubs lotion on Erik's thigh, he {{develops}} an involuntary erection and accidentally ejaculates over her possessions. Erik apologizes and explains to Ashley that, after breaking up with Tracy, he has not ejaculated in four months, masturbation being a taboo in his house because of a previous incident. Meanwhile, Cooze {{falls in love with}} Ashley's roommate Denise; however, she is nervous about showing her genitalia and having sex with him, so she gives Cooze a handjob instead. After talking with Erik, Bobby, and Dwight about Denise, Cooze develops <b>suspicions</b> <b>that</b> Denise might have a penis, so Dwight encourages him to find out.|$|E
5|$|In 1602 Frederico Spinola, {{younger brother}} of Ambrogio Spinola had {{distinguished}} himself greatly {{as a soldier}} in the Army of Flanders and had succeeded in 1599 going through the English Channel passing the straits of Dover unmolested; this led to a panic called the Invisible armada as it encouraged <b>suspicions</b> <b>that</b> the attempt might be renewed and on a larger scale. Buoyed by this achievement he had indulged Philip III of Spain, the Duke of Lerma and Martín de Padilla in a vision of a massive galley-borne invasion of England from Flanders. However the council brought him down to a mere eight galleys, provided at Spinola's expense. He was on his way from San Lucar to Lisbon but he was defeated by Sir Richard Leveson at Sezimbra Bay which cost him two galleys.|$|E

5|$|On 9 July 1960, {{there was}} a Force Publique mutiny at Camp Massart at Elizabethville; five or seven Europeans were killed. The army revolt and {{resulting}} rumours caused severe panic across the country, and Belgium despatched troops and the naval Task Group 218.2 to protect its citizens. Belgian troops intervened in Elisabethville and Luluabourg (10 July), Matadi (11 July), Leopoldville (13 July) and elsewhere. There were immediate <b>suspicions</b> <b>that</b> Belgium planned to re-seize the country while doing so. Large numbers of Belgian colonists fled the country. At the same time, on 11 July, Moise Tshombe declared the independence of Katanga province in the south-east, closely backed by remaining Belgian administrators and soldiers.|$|E
5|$|About 19:45, the 1st Army Group held {{a conference}} in Zagreb, just as German tanks were {{entering}} the city. Nedeljković told Petrović that {{he could no longer}} hold his positions, but despite this, Petrović ordered him to hold for at least 2–3 days to enable the withdrawal of the 7th Army to the Kupa river. Nedeljković replied that he no longer had an army, and suggested that all Serb officers and men be ordered back to form a defensive line along the Sava and Una rivers. Petrović refused to consider this, but ordered the 1st Cavalry Division to form a defensive line along the Sava between Jasenovac and Zagreb. The XLVI Motorised Corps encountered little resistance from the 4th Army, particularly from the 27th Infantry Division Savska and 40th Infantry Division Slavonska on its right, and by the evening of 10 April the whole 4th Army was disintegrating. Petrović wanted to dismiss Marić as commander of the 27th Infantry Division Savska due to <b>suspicions</b> <b>that</b> he was an Ustaše sympathiser, but could not identify a suitable replacement.|$|E
5|$|After {{finding out}} where the Ning-Po unloaded, Bond flies over the area in a heavily armed {{autogyro}} created by Q. Near a volcano, Bond is attacked by helicopters, which he defeats, confirming his <b>suspicions</b> <b>that</b> the enemy's base is nearby. A Soviet spacecraft is then captured in orbit by another unidentified craft, heightening tensions between Russia and the United States. The mysterious spaceship lands in an extensive base hidden inside the volcano. It soon {{turns out that the}} true mastermind behind this is SPECTRE, whose mysterious leader is revealed to be Ernst Stavro Blofeld, who has been hired by the People's Republic of China to start a Soviet-American war. Blofeld summons Osato for not having killed Bond, who immediately blames his assistant, Helga Brandt. Blofeld then gives Osato a last chance, but as Brandt leaves, he activates a mechanism that drops her into a pool filled of piranhas. Brandt is forced to pay for her failure with her life by being devoured alive, and Blofeld instructs Osato to kill Bond.|$|E
