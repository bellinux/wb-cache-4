5|$|During Wilfrid's {{lifetime}} Britain and Ireland {{consisted of}} a number of small kingdoms. Traditionally the English people were thought to have been divided into seven kingdoms, but modern historiography has shown that this is a simplification of a much more confused situation. A late 7th-century source, the Tribal Hidage, lists the peoples south of the Humber river; among the largest groups of peoples are the West Saxons (later Wessex), the East Angles and Mercians (later the Kingdom of Mercia), and the Kingdom of Kent. <b>Smaller</b> <b>groups</b> who at that time had their own royalty but were later absorbed into larger kingdoms include the peoples of Magonsæte, Lindsey, Hwicce, the East Saxons, the South Saxons, the Isle of Wight, and the Middle Angles. Other even <b>smaller</b> <b>groups</b> had their own rulers, but their size means that they do not often appear in the histories. There were also native Britons in the west, in modern-day Wales and Cornwall, who formed kingdoms including those of Dumnonia, Dyfed, and Gwynedd.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{importance}} of <b>small</b> <b>group</b> activity {{has recently been}} emphasized in the gifted education in science because of the increased needs to foster the human resources that could explore through the communication and collaboration. In this study, we investigated {{the characteristics of the}} verbal interaction according to the learning styles of the gifted-students in science in the <b>small</b> <b>group</b> activity and examined how learning style affected the interaction within a group in order to seek an effective grouping strategy. The competition, cooperative, and dependent students with learning style in the <b>small</b> <b>group</b> 1 and the cooperative, cooperative, dependent students in the <b>small</b> <b>group</b> 2 were assigned by the 6 science high school stu-dents. The analyses of the results revealed that the <b>small</b> <b>group</b> 1 showed the asymmetric interaction of the low level, whereas the <b>small</b> <b>group</b> 2 showed the symmetric interaction of the high level. In other words, the frequencies of in-depth interaction in the <b>small</b> <b>group</b> 2 were higher than those in the <b>small</b> <b>group</b> 1, and also students in the <b>small</b> <b>group</b> 2 were equally involve...|$|R

5|$|The American robin {{is active}} mostly during the day, {{and on its}} winter grounds it assembles in large flocks at night to roost in trees in secluded swamps or dense vegetation.

5|$|The two strongest {{succession}} {{candidates were}} Brigham Young, senior member {{and president of}} the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and Sidney Rigdon, the senior member of the First Presidency. In a church-wide conference on August 8, most of the Latter Day Saints elected Young, who led them to the Utah Territory as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Membership in Young's denomination surpassed 14 million members in 2010. <b>Smaller</b> <b>groups</b> followed Sidney Rigdon and James J. Strang, who had based his claim on an allegedly-forged letter of appointment. Others followed Lyman Wight and Alpheus Cutler. Many members of these <b>smaller</b> <b>groups,</b> including most of Smith's family, eventually coalesced in 1860 under the leadership of Joseph Smith III and formed what was known {{for more than a century}} as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (now Community of Christ), which now has about 250,000 members. , members of the denominations originating from Smith's teachings number approximately 15 million.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, the {{butterflies}} have been divided into the superfamily Papilionoidea excluding the <b>smaller</b> <b>groups</b> of the Hesperiidae (skippers) {{and the more}} moth-like Hedylidae of America.

5|$|Adult males live mostly {{alone or}} in groups of two to three, and join pods for short periods of time. Adult females and young {{dolphins}} normally live in groups of up to 15 animals. However, they live in fission-fusion societies of varying group size, within which individuals change associations, often on a daily or hourly basis. Group compositions are usually determined by sex, age, reproductive condition, familial relations and affiliation histories. In a dolphin community near Sarasota, Florida, the most common group types are adults females with their recent offspring, older subadults of both sexes and adult males either {{alone or in}} bonded pairs. <b>Smaller</b> <b>groups</b> can join to form larger groups of 100 or more, and occasionally exceed 1,000.|$|E
5|$|Common elands are nomadic and crepuscular. They eat in {{the morning}} and evening, rest in shade when hot and remain in {{sunlight}} when cold. They are commonly found in herds of up to 500, with individual members remaining in the herd anywhere from several hours to several months. Juveniles and mothers tend to form larger herds, while males may separate into <b>smaller</b> <b>groups</b> or wander individually. During estrus, mainly in the rainy season, groups tend to form more regularly. In southern Africa common elands will often associate with herds of zebras, roan antelopes and oryxes.|$|E

5|$|Coprinellus disseminatus resembles C.impatiens, {{but may be}} {{distinguished}} by its slightly larger fruit body, somewhat deliquescent gills, and tendency to fruit in <b>smaller</b> <b>groups</b> on the ground, rather than on or around rotting wood. Also, C.disseminatus has smaller spores than C.impatiens, typically 6.6–9.7 by 4.1–5.8μm. C.eurysporus is similar to C.disseminatus but usually grows in groups on fallen branches, and has broader spores that measure 8.3–10.3 by 6.7–8.4µm. C.hiascens usually grows in small dense clumps, has narrower spores (typically 9–11 by 4.5–5.5μm, and produces smaller fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|In 1911 {{the city}} adopted a {{commission}} form of government, which had three members elected by at-large voting.
