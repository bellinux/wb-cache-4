[...] "Glazebrook told me of one--flushed like a woman at a bargain sale, he said--and when he pointed out {{to her that the}} silk she'd got was bloodstained, <b>she</b> <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> 'Oh, bother!' and threw it aside and went back...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some soldier {{took me to}} an officer's tent. Nell was there, {{some white}} an' all in. <b>She</b> <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> 'Laddy!' Thorne was there, too, an' he was bein' worked over by the camp doctor. I didn't ask no questions, because I seen quiet was needed round that tent. After {{satisfying}} myself that Nell was all right, an' Thorne in no danger, I went out.|$|E
60|$|So <b>she</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> {{nothing at}} all about the matter, not even when Tom came next day with the rest for sweet things. He was horribly afraid of coming: but he was still more afraid of staying away, lest any one should suspect him. He was dreadfully afraid, too, lest there should be no sweets--as was to be expected, he having eaten them all--and lest then the fairy should inquire who had taken them. But, behold! she pulled out just as many as ever, which {{astonished}} Tom, and frightened him still more.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Mool waited, {{and waited}} in vain. He {{reminded}} his client of what <b>she</b> had <b>just</b> <b>said.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Of that, your Highness, I {{can recall}} nothing, or very little," [...] then, doubtless remembering what <b>she</b> had <b>just</b> <b>said</b> to me, <b>she</b> made obeisance and {{passed from the}} chamber.|$|R
60|$|With some difficulty, Mountjoy {{controlled}} himself. After what <b>she</b> had <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> {{his lips}} were sealed {{on the subject of}} Mrs. Vimpany's true character. He could only persist in appealing to her duty to her father.|$|R
6000|$|... "At first <b>she</b> <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> 'My dear, I cannot {{attend to}} you now, run away;' {{but then in}} the midst, a thought seemed to strike her, and she said, rather frightened, 'Is any one hurt?' and I said, Oh no; only my {{umbrella}} has gone right through {{the roof of the}} conservatory, and I thought I ought to come and tell her directly. 'That was the noise,' said some of the people, and everybody {{got up and went to}} look. And there were Fly and Ivy, who had got in some other way, and the umbrella was sticking right upright in the top of one of those palm-trees with leaves like screens, and somebody said it was a new development of fruit. Lady Rotherwood asked them what they were doing there, and Ivy said they had come to see what harm was done. Dear Fly ran up to her and said, 'We were all at play together, mother; it was not one more than another;' but Lady Rotherwood only said, 'That's enough, Phyllis, I will come to you by-and-by in the schoolroom,' and she would have sent us away if Cousin Rotherwood himself had not come in just then, and asked what was the matter. I heard some of the answers; they were very odd, mamma. One was, 'A storm of umbrellas and of untimely confessions;' and another was, 'Truth in undress.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|Corp {{tried to}} think. [...] "I said, 'This cows, Grizel, {{but thank you}} kindly,'" [...] he answered, much pleased with his effort of memory, but the doctor {{interrupted}} him rudely. [...] "Nobody wants {{to hear what you}} said, you dottrel; what more did she say?" [...] And thus encouraged Corp remembered that she had said she hoped he would not forget her. [...] "What for should I forget her when I see her ilka day?" [...] he asked, and was probably about to divulge that this was his reply to her, but without waiting for more, McQueen turned his beast's head and drove to the entrance to the Double Dykes. Here he alighted and hastened up the path on foot, but before he reached the house he met Dite Deuchars taking his ease beneath a tree, and Dite could tell him that Grizel was not at home. [...] "But there's somebody in Double Dykes," [...] he said, [...] "though I kenna wha could be there unless it's the ghost of the Painted Lady hersel'. About an hour syne I saw Grizel come out o' the house, carrying a bundle, but she hadna gone many yards when she turned round and waved her hand to the east window. I couldna see wha was at it, but there maun have been somebody, for first the crittur waved to the window and next she kissed her hand to it, and syne she went on a bit, and syne she ran back close to the window and nodded and flung more kisses, and back and forrit she went a curran times as if she could hardly tear hersel' awa'. 'Wha's that you're so chief wi'?' I speired when she came by me at last, but <b>she</b> <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> 'I won't tell you,' in her dour wy, and she hasna come back yet." ...|$|E
50|$|When Erwiana {{heard the}} news, <b>she</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> {{that she was}} surprised, hoping that no more women be treated under such circumstances.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Broughton," [...] {{continued}} Clara, [...] "I must beg you {{to understand}} that mamma has not the slightest right {{in the world to}} tell you what <b>she</b> <b>just</b> now <b>said</b> about me. Nothing on earth would induce me to become the wife of Mr. Broughton's partner." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{kissed her}} serene and humid eyes, and {{repeated}} what <b>she</b> had <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> syllable for syllable. Anna {{has not been}} unmindful of her words; for rarely, indeed, has she touched on the past, and then oftener in allusion to her own sorrows, than in reference to my impressions.|$|R
60|$|Fortunately {{she knew}} at once {{what to do}} 'It must be sewn on,' <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>just</b> a little patronisingly.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{she said}} [...] "Jinkies," [...] <b>she</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Oh My!" [...] Velma Dinkley is the {{youngest}} member of the gang. Her parents pushed her from an early age, and as a result, she has earned hundreds of awards for achievement.|$|E
5000|$|... {{she just}} {{continued}} on and <b>she</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> that she couldn't stand {{to listen to}} me whistle, that every time I touched her, she felt sick, that I was a lousy fuck and that I had a little penis and that she's never going to fuck me again, and I'm just sitting there with my head down; and by this time, she's kneeling on the seat and she's yelling this in my face.|$|E
5000|$|Since mid-2003, {{voice artist}} Emma Clarke has {{provided}} recordings for the 1992 Stock DVA, which were again revised in 2006. Emma continues to voice the line, despite London Underground allegedly 'sacking' her after {{an article by}} the Daily Mail was published in 2007. The article took her words from an interview out of context; saying that she [...] "hated the tube," [...] when in actual fact, <b>she</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> {{that she would not}} like to be in a tube carriage voiced by herself for self-conscious reasons.|$|E
60|$|What did she mean? Was she {{clinging}} {{desperately to}} {{the hope of}} melting Michael Vanstone's heart? Mr. Clare could draw no other conclusion from what <b>she</b> had <b>just</b> <b>said</b> to him. At {{the beginning of the}} interview he would have roughly dispelled her delusion. At the end of the interview he left her compassionately in possession of it.|$|R
60|$|At {{those last}} words her voice--quiet and {{even through the}} earlier part of her sad story--began to falter once more. She stopped, {{following}} silently the memories and associations roused in her by what <b>she</b> had <b>just</b> <b>said.</b> Had <b>she</b> forgotten the presence of another person in the room? Grace's curiosity left Grace no resource but {{to say a word}} on her side.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Everything but {{the name}} of her rival. To that she would not listen. It was not <b>just,</b> <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> to one so unfortunate and so unhappy.' ...|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} afternoon while Mrs. Huber is away, Julie and Susan play frisbee; {{it flies}} into Martha's yard. Julie puts gloves on, slips through the doggy door, {{and grabs the}} measuring cup. As this is happening, Susan is being the lookout. Mike comes over, and invited her to see a show with him. Edie pulls up, causing Susan to panic. She stalls them by suggesting that Mike take Edie to the show since she is busy. Edie happily agrees {{and at that moment}} Julie walks up behind, causing Susan to regret what <b>she</b> <b>just</b> <b>said.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Simpson {{described}} her sister's advice {{on having a}} reality show: [...] "She said I'd {{have to put it}} all on the table and just be myself, so that's what I've done." [...] She also said that [...] "Having a reality show could be scary, but I don't have anything to hide." [...] In one interview, she referred to the awkwardness of realizing something <b>she</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> was filmed. Regarding the camera crews taping her, she has said: [...] "The MTV crew became my close friends so {{we had a lot of}} fun." ...|$|E
5000|$|Substantially [...] "daughter of evil" [...] {{was at the}} {{position}} of a queen, however, out of deference to her mother the queen she decided she would rule the kingdom as a princess and would not take over the throne until she came of age. One day, a mighty famine suddenly struck the kingdom and many people lost their lives for hunger except some haves. Some lieges told her how people were impoverished and offered their opinions to provide relief for them, but <b>she</b> <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "If they don't have bread, they had better eat cake!" [...] (a reference to the apocryphal line supposedly spoken by Marie Antoinette; [...] "Qu'ils mangent de la brioche") ...|$|E
6000|$|... "John," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>just</b> before <b>she</b> went to bed, [...] "if {{there be}} {{anything}} wrong {{between you and}} Patience, I conjure you to tell me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Truth, Sir Archie, she's a {{woman and}} wilful, and <b>she</b> <b>just</b> laughed and <b>said</b> that you would know you could not keep her in order yourself, and could not {{therefore}} expect me to rule her." ...|$|R
5000|$|Girl Men Can't Hear, a {{woman who}} tries to put forward an idea {{to a group of}} men but is {{completely}} ignored, only for a man in that group to repeat what <b>she</b> has <b>just</b> <b>said</b> and receive congratulations from the others for having had such a good idea. This character was apparently invented by Arabella Weir to parody similar experiences she'd had with the men in the Fast Show team.|$|R
5000|$|... "Mercy" [...] {{was written}} by Duffy and Steve Booker during {{the final stages of}} {{completion}} for Rockferry. In an interview with Mojo, Duffy noted that she [...] "felt something was missing and 'Mercy' was that missing thing", saying that herself and Booker were [...] "writing it literally at the end, when the strings were being put on 'Rockferry' and 'Warwick Avenue". Duffy first met Booker by chance because she bought the flat in Ladbroke Grove that Booker had been renting. Booker's girlfriend met Duffy and then introduced the pair. Duffy has later noted of the experience:"We went for coffee and I had this gut feeling that we should write together. I asked Jeanette Lee what she thought and <b>she</b> <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> we’ve made this record so go and have fun, be creative. By the end of hanging out in the studio for two weeks we had 'Mercy' and 'Stepping Stone'." ...|$|E
5000|$|Very shortly thereafter, Jovin {{headed out}} on {{foot to the}} Yale police {{communications}} center under the arch at Phelps Gate on Yale’s Old Campus to return {{the keys to the}} car she had borrowed. Shortly before reaching her destination, at about 9:22pm, Jovin encountered classmate Peter Stein who was out for a walk. Stein is quoted by the Yale Daily News as saying [...] "She did not mention plans to go anywhere or do anything else afterward. <b>She</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> that she was very, very tired and that she was looking forward to getting a lot of sleep." [...] Stein also said Jovin was not wearing a backpack, was holding one or more sheets of white 8 ½ x 11 inch paper in her right hand, that she was walking at a [...] "normal" [...] pace and did not look nervous or excited, and that their encounter lasted only two to three minutes.|$|E
50|$|At work, Betty {{shows up}} in her outfit... only to {{discover}} that there is no costume party (it looks like Marc made a series of prank e-mails). Betty is about to have her work cut out for her when Daniel asks her to track down his lost watch, which he left at a girlfriend's place, but he can't remember which one. He tells Betty to get Amanda to help her, but it appears that Amanda may be holding back in a jealous fit, for it turns out that she has the watch. Betty finally puts two and two together, and confronts Amanda in the bathroom. Amanda reveals to Betty that she always wanted Daniel for herself but she is tired of his constant one-night stands with other women and admits her hope that he'll pick her, knowing it'll never happen. Having got this off her chest, Amanda pulls herself together, and tells Betty to forget what <b>she</b> <b>just</b> <b>said.</b> She gives the watch to Betty, who in turn passes it back to Daniel.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's over," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>just</b> audibly, [...] "and there's nothing now--it was dead, you know. I don't want to live. Oh, Mrs. Fiorsen, why can't {{they let}} me die, too?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It is a King's ship, sure enough, and <b>she</b> lies <b>just</b> there,' <b>said</b> Long John, {{pointing}} {{out over the}} quarter. 'Merchant adventurers have civil tongues. It's your blue-coated, gold-braided, swivel-eyed, quarter-deckers that talk of canes. Ha! did I not tell ye!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't see the {{necessity}} of her being so mysterious about it," [...] declared the girl. [...] "Josie ought to know I'm worthy of her confidence. And <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>just</b> the other day, that we're partners." ...|$|R
50|$|Skye {{showed up}} in Llanview in July 1999 {{at the request of}} Asa Buchanan. Asa hoped that she would help him destroy his enemy, Ben Davidson. Skye did this by using Asa's money to bribe a member of the Nevada Medical Board to revoke Ben's medical license. Skye got a job at The Banner, one of Llanview's newspapers, as Styles Editor and became {{friendly}} with the publisher, Viki Carpenter. She seemed especially interested in Viki's romantic relationship with Ben Davidson. The reason for this soon became clear. At a party, in front of all of Viki's friends and family, Skye announced that she was Ben Davidson's wife. Ben had thought the marriage was over, since they had filled out annulment papers, but Skye never filed them. Skye resisted all of Ben's attempts to get her to sign divorce papers and dropped another bombshell on Ben. The reason she didn't file for the annulment was that she was pregnant and they have a son together. But Skye soon admitted she was lying; they did not have a child, <b>she</b> <b>just</b> <b>said</b> that to try to hold onto him. Skye eventually agreed to sign the divorce papers and Ben was free to be with Viki.|$|E
5000|$|She {{was just}} the sweetest, most {{wonderful}} person in the world... and then she killed herself. Her husband came and stayed with me at my house, because he said, [...] "I can't stay over there, it's too painful." [...] And about a week later, {{they asked me to}} audition for Daphne ... and I didn't know what to do, because I just thought, [...] "Gosh, I just don't know if I can do that." [...] I told him, [...] "They asked me to audition, but I'm not going to audition, because it's just weird." [...] And he said, [...] "Grey, you have to do it, because Mary Kay would've wanted you to do it. You were her star student, she loved you, and she would've wanted you to do Daphne. Somebody's going to do it. It might as well be someone who loved her." [...] And I was, like, [...] "I didn't really think about it like that." [...] So I went in, and I didn't study it, because I just thought, [...] "You know what? I’m just going to go in, and I’m just going to do my best interpretation of the character. I'm not going to try and sound-match her, because it would just be too sad to listen to her voice." [...] So I went in, and Eddie - the engineer at the time - and Collette Sunderman, the director, <b>she</b> <b>just</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "When you came in, Grey, it was just eerie. It was like there was some other hand in it, because you sounded exactly like Mary Kay." [...] So I guess it was meant to be, because I didn't try. It just came out that way. They wanted me to speak at her memorial, and her husband really wanted me to speak, but I just couldn't talk. I just kept crying and crying and... oh, would you look at me with the crying? Here I am talking about crying again. (Laughs) You're thinking, [...] "This girl's a mess!" [...] But, yeah, it was an interesting turn of events to get to play Daphne, but I'm so glad that I have the role, and I was glad that I was able to carry that on for her. She set the bar very high.|$|E
5000|$|... "I played {{these songs}} to Susan {{the other day}} - <b>she</b> <b>just</b> laughed and <b>said</b> I was being spiteful because she wouldn't sleep with me when we first met. She also said {{to tell you that}} she's {{perfectly}} happy where she is at the moment, thank you very much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-evening!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>just</b> {{a trifle}} condescendingly, as she shook hands. [...] "How {{do you find}} Woodhouse, after being away so long?" [...] Her way of {{speaking}} was so quiet, as if she hardly spoke aloud.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I shall {{tell you}} the truth, Fred. I think mother got a letter, {{but she did not}} shew it me. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> <b>just</b> a word, but nothing more. Father Marty will {{certainly}} know if she knows." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Crawford's countenance, as Julia spoke, {{might have}} amused a disinterested observer. She looked almost aghast {{under the new}} idea she was receiving. Fanny pitied her. [...] "How distressed she will be at what <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>just</b> now," [...] passed across her mind.|$|R
