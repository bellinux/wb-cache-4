50|$|Self-fulfilling {{currency}} crisis {{lies in the}} center of the 2nd generation {{currency crisis}} theory. First proposed by Obstfeld, the <b>Self-fulfilling</b> <b>mechanism</b> is constructed as a complement of 1st generation theory. In the 1st generation theory a country’s currency will be attacked by speculators only if fundamental inconsistency exists in domestic policies, typically inflationary budget deficits and fixed exchange rate. Obstfeld etc. provided another way to analyze the happening of currency crisis focusing effect of self-confirming of pessimism.|$|E
50|$|In its weekly auctions {{of bonds}} during December 1994 and January 1995, the Banco de Mexico found it {{difficult}} to roll over its government debt. The fear of a government default led to an inability of the government to issue new debt, which in turn seemed about to confirm the fears of a default until the United States intervened with a rescue package. The crisis occurred {{despite the fact that the}} Mexican government’s fiscal behavior in terms of a standard measures such as its debt/GDP ratio, appears to have been healthy with respect to both its own past performance and the performance of many other governments that had not experienced similar crises. At the time of the crisis, the average maturity of Mexico’s debt had become very short. When the crisis occurred, the Mexican government found itself unable to sell either dollar-indexed bonds or domestically denominated debt, which seems hard to explain on the basis of economic fundamentals but easy to explain by <b>self-fulfilling</b> <b>mechanism.</b>|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{theoretical}} literature on currency crisis, this paper analyses {{the heritage of}} F. H. Cardoso? two mandates. Hyper-inflation has been defeated. But recent Asian and Russian crisis have brought about {{the collapse of the}} currency peg and a huge depreciation. After a fast recovery, the international slowdown and the uncertainties involved by the next elections (4 th quarter 2002) have triggered a new speculative attack. The first section investigates the causes of Brazil weak credibility on international capital market. Highlighting the very sources of fiscal imbalances, the second section emphasises the need from deepening public sector reforms. Following these arguments, this paper concludes that conventional models of currency crises ¿ focusing inconsistencies in macroeconomic policy ¿ give a better explanation of Brazilian vulnerability than recent models based on <b>self-fulfilling</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> multiple equilibria, or credibility factors. ...|$|R
50|$|During {{the ongoing}} European debt crisis, several {{countries}} in the euro area find it difficult or impossible to roll over their government debt {{without the help of}} the third parties. The debt levels of European countries kept rising since 2007, mostly due to the large bailout packages provided to the financial sector during the late-2000s financial crisis. However, high debt levels alone may not explain the crisis. The budget deficit for the euro area as a whole is much lower and the euro area's government debt/GDP ratio of 86% in 2010 was about the same level as that of the U.S.Prior to development of the crisis it was assumed by both regulators and banks that sovereign debt from the eurozone was safe. Banks had substantial holdings of bonds from economies such as Greece which offered a small premium and seemingly were equally sound. As the crisis developed it became obvious that Greek, and possibly other countries', bonds offered substantially more risk. The loss of confidence is marked by rising sovereign CDS prices, indicating market expectations about countries' creditworthiness. Beginning in early 2010, renewed anxiety about excessive national debt of investors demanded ever higher interest rates from several government with higher debt leveles, deficits and current account deficits. This in turn made it difficult for some governments to finance further budget deficits and service existing debt, particularly when economic growth rates were low, {{as in the case of}} Greece and Portugal. The loss of confidence and the consequent government behaviors can be explained by the <b>self-fulfilling</b> <b>mechanism.</b>|$|E

40|$|In a Bayesian game G, {{the players}} first receive private {{information}} {{on the state of}} nature and then simultaneously choose an action. We assume that the vector of actions a generates a signal g(a). A mechanism for G is a mapping [mu] from the set of states of nature S to the product sert of players’ actions A. [mu] is self-fulfilling if, given the information revealed by [mu] (namely, g([mu]) (s)) if the state of nature is s), no player can gain in unilaterally deviating from the action prescribed by the mechanism. Let SF(G) denote the set of payoffs achievable through an incentive compatible <b>self-fulfilling</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Examples show that SF(G) may not intersect the set N(G) of Nash equilibrium payoffs of G. Obviously, SF(G) and N(G) coincide if G is a game of complete information. Let E be an exchange economy with differential information. We associate a (Bayesian) market game GE with E. In GE, the signal generated by the players’ actions is a vector of prices. We prove that the allocations achieved through a <b>self-fulfilling</b> <b>mechanism</b> in GE coincide with the rational expectations equilibrium allocations in E. In order to understand how self-fulfillingness can be achieved in a dynamic framework, we analyze the relationship between SF(G) and the Nash equilibria of the infinitely repeated game G [infinity] generated by G. We show in particular that SF(G) can be interpreted as a set of inert solutions of G [infinity]. communication equilibrium, Nash equilibrium, rational expectations equilibrium...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the joint {{determination}} of gender differentials in labor market outcomes and in the household division of labor. Specifically, we explore the hypothesis that incentive problems in the labor market amplify differences in earnings due to gender differentials in home hours. In turn, earnings differentials reinforce the division of labor within the household, leading to a potentially <b>self-fulfilling</b> feedback <b>mechanism.</b> The workings of the labor market are key in our story. The main assumptions are that the utility cost of work effort is increasing in home hours, and that higher effort should correspond to higher incentive pay. Household decisions are Pareto efficient, leading to a negative correlation between relative home hours and earnings across spouses. We use the Census and the PSID to study these predictions and find that they are supported by the data. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a standard New Keynesian model with heterogeneous expectations {{on the future}} level of inflation and output. A biased perception of the target pursued by the Central Bank may arise due to idiosyncrasies in information processing, leading to heterogeneous beliefs about the target. We consider an arbitrarily large number of agents’ beliefs and apply the concept of Large Type Limit. We find that {{an increase in the}} sensitivity of agents in selecting the optimal prediction strategy or in the spread of beliefs is crucial for the extent of the Central Bank to stabilize the economy. When the predictors are largely dispersed around the target, the Taylor principle is a requisite for stability since it prevents the <b>self-fulfilling</b> reinforcement <b>mechanism</b> between the realizations of the relevant macroeconomic variables and the forecasts of the agents. When the set of beliefs is somehow anchored to the target, stability can be achieved with weaker monetary policy...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} underground {{activities and}} tax evasion into a one sector dynamic {{general equilibrium model}} with aggregate external effects. The model presents a novel <b>mechanism</b> driving the <b>self-fulfilling</b> prophecies, which is characterized by well behaved (downward sloping) labor demand schedules. This mechanism differs from the customary one, and it is complementary to it. Compared to traditional labor market income, the income derived from underground labor activity is subject to a lower expected tax rate when considering both the probability of detection and the evasion penalty. During a belief-driven expansion, the household allocates more time to both traditional and underground labor supply. In equilibrium, this action serves to lower the effective labor tax rate faced by the household, thus providing stimulus to aggregate labor supply {{so as to make}} the initial expansion <b>self-fulfilling.</b> The <b>mechanism</b> here is akin to a “regressive tax”; the household’s effective tax rate depends negatively on the level of total labor income. We argue that an underground sector, and the associated tax evasion, offer a good economic rationale for a regressive tax rate...|$|R
40|$|We extend an {{equivalence}} theorem proved by Forges and Minelli [Journal of Economic Theory 75 (1997) 388] to {{a market}} game, which does not require that a specific commodity is used as money. Under {{the assumption that the}} set of commodities is a net, we show an equivalence between the set of allocations generated by self-fulfilling mechanisms and the set of rational expectations equilibrium allocations. We construct an example, which shows that this equivalence breaks down when the net assumption fails to hold: in such cases, traders cannot obtain, through a <b>self-fulfilling</b> <b>mechanism,</b> the information revealed by rational expectations equilibrium prices.

40|$|We study {{immigration}} policy {{in a small}} open receiving economy under self-selection of migrants. We show that a non-discriminatory {{immigration policy}} choice affects and {{is affected by the}} migratory decisions of skilled and unskilled foreign workers. From this interaction multiple equilibria may arise, which are driven by the natives' expectations on the welfare effects of immigration. In particular, pessimistic (optimistic) beliefs induce a country to impose higher (lower) barriers to immigration, which crowd out (crowd in) skilled migrants and thus confirm initial beliefs. This <b>self-fulfilling</b> <b>mechanism</b> sustains the endogenous formation of an anti or pro-immigration prejudice. We discuss how the adoption of a skill-selective policy affects this result...|$|E

5000|$|Debord {{was deeply}} distressed by {{the hegemony of}} governments and media over {{everyday}} life through mass production and consumption. He criticized both the capitalism of the West and the dictatorial communism of the Eastern bloc {{for the lack of}} autonomy allowed to individuals by both types of governmental structure. Debord postulated that Alienation had gained a new relevance through the invasive forces of the 'spectacle' - [...] "a social relation between people that is mediated by images" [...] consisting of mass media, advertisement, and popular culture. The spectacle is a <b>self-fulfilling</b> control <b>mechanism</b> for society. Debord's analysis developed the notions of [...] "reification" [...] and [...] "fetishism of the commodity" [...] pioneered by Karl Marx and Georg Lukács. Semiotics was also a major influence, particularly the work of his contemporary, Roland Barthes, who was the first to envisage bourgeois society as a spectacle, and to study in detail the political function of fashion within that spectacle. Debord's analysis of [...] "the spectaclist society" [...] probed the historical, economic, and psychological roots of the media and popular culture. Central to this school of thought was the claim that alienation is more than an emotive description or an aspect of individual psychology: rather, it is a consequence of the mercantile form of social organization that has reached its climax in capitalism, as theorized by Herbert Marcuse of the Frankfurt School. The Situationist International (SI), a political/artistic movement organized by Debord and his colleagues and represented by a journal of the same name, attempted to create a series of strategies for engaging in class struggle by reclaiming individual autonomy from the spectacle. These strategies, including [...] "dérive" [...] and [...] "détournement," [...] drew on the traditions of Lettrism. As founder of the SI, {{it has been suggested that}} Debord felt driven to generalize and define the values, ideas, and characteristics of the entire group, which may have contributed to his hand-picking and expulsion of members. The hierarchical and dictatorial nature of the SI existed, however, in the groups that birthed it, including the Letterists and the Surrealists.|$|R
40|$|If workers {{anticipate}} a technological innovation, some workers {{may decide to}} quit their job and retrain themselves to acquire the skills which are needed by this new technology. However, this may facilitate the innovation {{and make it a}} self-fulfilling prophecy. This <b>self-fulfilling</b> <b>mechanism</b> is reinforced if the anticipated innovation causes job insecurity for workers who do not retrain themselves and keep their current job, but realize that the innovation may make their job obsolete. If these workers engage in precautionary saving and cut their consumption expenditures, aggregate output contracts. This gives the other workers an extra incentive to quit their job and acquire new skills, and therefore facilitates even more the innovation which consumers were worried about. This paper formalizes this idea. It also provides an illustration of how a first-order Taylor-approximation of the Euler equation yields an effect of precautionary saving. ...|$|E
40|$|I {{show how}} {{multiple}} equilibria or development traps {{occur in a}} two sector partial equilibrium model given an externality among interme-diate inputs. The final goods sector achieves a higher productivity by adopting more roundabout ways of production. The growing de-mand by the final goods sector, in turn, induces more and more firms to enter the intermediate goods sector facilitating {{a wider range of}} production services to become available. This leads to a circular-ity or a <b>self-fulfilling</b> <b>mechanism</b> that triggers the economy to take off. The positive externality that arises because of the interaction be-tween the sectors is the key to my model. Although the complemen-tarity of newly arrived technologies effect the degree of the externality the equlibrium path of the economy is determined only by the initial degree of the intermediate input variety.

40|$|Abstract: Can {{immigration}} policy {{be driven by}} self-fulfilling beliefs? This column argues that pessimistic (optimistic) beliefs on the skill composition of the migrant population (and, hence, {{on the effects of}} immigration on welfare) induce a country to impose higher (lower) barriers to immigration, which crowd out (crowd in) skilled migrants and thus confirm initial beliefs. This <b>self-fulfilling</b> <b>mechanism</b> sustains the endogenous formation of an anti or pro-immigration "prejudice " and may help rationalize the cross-country variation in attitudes towards immigration and choices of {{immigration policy}}. Immigration policy varies across receiving countries, sometimes to a large extent. While virtually all countries in the world impose restrictions on the mobility of people, different countries impose different levels of restrictions to immigration. These differences reflect the perception of the relative costs and benefits of immigration for the recipient countries in terms of economic performance, redistributive consequences, effects on public finances and the labor market, crime, capacity to integrate, etc. (see Facchini and Mayda, 2008). In particular, these costs and benefits are affected, among others, by the skill composition of the migrant population. It is widely believed that skilled migrants are more beneficial to the receiving country than unskilled migrants. Several arguments have been advanced to maintain this claim, such as: positive spillovers of skilled migrants for the receiving economy, higher production complementarities between skilled labor and capital, greater flexibility of the skilled labor market, higher fiscal cost of low-skill immigrants (see Borjas...|$|E
