Richards, this linker may be cleaved by subtilisin between residues 20 and 21 without causing the N-terminal helix to dissociate from the rest of RNase A. The peptide-protein complex is called RNase S, the peptide (residues 1-20) is called the S-peptide and the remainder (residues 21-124) is called the <b>S-protein.</b> The dissociation constant of the S-peptide for the <b>S-protein</b> is roughly 30 pM; this tight binding can be exploited for protein purification by attaching the S-peptide to the protein of interest and passing a mixture over an affinity column with bound <b>S-protein.</b> smaller C-peptide The RNase S model system has also been used for studying protein folding by coupling folding and association.

Key words: Gametophytic self-incompatibility — Japanese pear — Pyrus serotina Rehd. — RNase — Self-compatible mutant — Stylar proteins. Self-incompatibility is a system for promotion of out-crossing.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of the thesis, {{experiments}} are described where self-compatible tetraploids of L. peruvianum were isolated from tissue culture and the expression and inheritance of their S-related proteins was explored. The S-related protein profiles of styles of self-compatible tetraploids were indistinguishable from the diploid self-incompatible explant source based on SDS-PAGE. Progenies obtained from self-fertilization of two tetraploids were all found to be self-compatible. Cloned cDNA sequences of the S-related proteins were used to determine the inheritance at the locus in these progenies through Southern hybridization. The allelic ratio consistent with the predicted ratio obtained if only the pollen bearing two different alleles was successful in achieving fertilization. This work demonstrates that the observed self-compatibility in the tetraploids was due to failure of recognition of heterogenic pollen by the style, while the expression and activity of the S-related stylar proteins remained unaffected. ^ In the second part of the thesis, periclinal chimeras between the SI L. peruvianum (P) and the SC L. esculentum (E) were utilized to analyze the relative influence of apical cell layers as they relate to SI and Unilateral incompatibility (UI). Irrespective of the expression of <b>S-proteins</b> in the chimeral styles, the chimeras were compatible with P component indicating that there was failure of recognition of the 2 ̆ 2 self 2 ̆ 2 pollen (the chimeras and the P component are genetically similar at the S-locus). The breakdown of SI was not related to the RNase activity of the <b>S-proteins</b> which was intact in all chimeras. Therefore <b>S-proteins</b> are not sufficient to maintain the SI response. Since the response was lost if either of the two layers (L 1 and L 2) was composed of E component, we conclude that both L 1 and L 2 are required for the SI phenotype. On the other hand, UI response was maintained in all the chimeras in which the L 1 or L 2 layer was P.

40|$|Many {{flowering}} plants are hermaphrodite, which poses {{the problem of}} self-fertilisation and the subsequent loss of genetic fitness in the offspring. To prevent this, plants have developed a genetically controlled mechanism called self-incompatibility (SI) which allows self (incompatible) pollen to be recognised and rejected before fertilisation can occur. The SI response of Papaver rhoeas (field poppy) has been extensively studied at the molecular and cellular level. Rejection of incompatible pollen occurs on the stigma surface when the pollen S-determinant PrpS, a transmembrane protein, interacts with the stigmatic S-determinant, secreted <b>S-proteins.</b> This triggers a calcium-mediated signalling cascade that targets the cytoskeleton and results in programmed cell death (PCD) of incompatible pollen. Work presented in this thesis investigated the localisation of PrpS and <b>S-proteins.</b> Other studies investigated {{the role of the}} cytoskeleton in SI. These demonstrated the involvement of the microtubule cytoskeleton for the first time. Microtubules were rapidly depolymerised and this was implicated in signalling to PCD. The actin cytoskeleton has previously been shown to exhibit biphasic alterations during SI involving depolymerisation, followed by formation of F-actin foci. Studies described here represent the first steps toward characterisation of the F-actin foci. Their potential involvement in PCD and signalling is discussed.

40|$|Pigs {{coexist with}} diverse and dense {{commensal}} microbiota in their gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Lactobacilli, identified as common members of porcine intestinal microbiota, {{have been considered}} to be an important group of bacteria in maintaining the stability of GIT, in preventing intestinal infections and generally, in supporting intestinal health. Because several species of lactobacilli have GRAS (generally regarded as safe) status and some of them have an ability to interact with intestinal epithelial cells, thus promoting host-bacterial interactions, their possible applications as mucosal vaccine vector and/or probiotics have aroused interest. Selection criteria for lactobacilli to be used as vaccine vector or probiotic include the abilities to adhere to the intestinal epithelium cells and colonize the lumen of the GI tract. The adherence to host tissues, which enables the organism to overcome local defences such as mucociliary function and peristaltis, is usually mediated by specialized proteins called adhesins. These adhesins are responsible for recognizing and binding to specific receptor structures of the host cells. Bacterial adhesins are often found in hair-like appendages called pili or fimbriae that extend outward from bacterial surface. Alternatively, they can be directly associated with the microbial cell surface. Surface layer proteins (Slps) of lactobacilli have been shown to confer tissue adherence. In this study, S-layer positive lactobacilli from the intestine and faeces of pigs were isolated and their ability to adhere to pig and human intestinal cells as well as to extracellular matrix (ECM) components, collagen, laminin and fibronectin were studied. The adherence of S-layer carrying lactobacilli varied from strong to moderate for human and porcine small intestine enterocytes and for the components of ECM and basal membranes (BM). Removal of the intact Slps reduced the adhesion of some strains to fibronectin and laminin, whereas, the adhesiveness to laminin increased with some strains. Besides the putative binding properties of Slps, {{a very large number of}} surface layer protein subunits present in an S-layer make the use of the S-layer structure a very 7 interesting alternative to surface display antigens. Therefore, the aim of this study was to characterize the S-layer proteins. Two new surface layer proteins (SlpB and SlpD), with potential to be tested as antigen carriers, were characterized, and three S-layer protein (slpB, slpC and slpD) genes were isolated, sequenced, and studied for their expression in Lactobacillus brevis neotype strain ATCC 14869. Under different growth conditions, L. brevis strain was found to form two colony types, smooth (S) and rough (R), and to express the <b>S-proteins</b> differently by mechanism not involving DNA rearrangements. The adhesion studies indicate that L. brevis adheres to human and pig intestinal epithelial cells but it is not currently known whether the binding is mediated by the surface proteins in this L. brevis strain of human origin. To identify the S-layer positive lactobacilli strains used in this study, a polyphasic taxonomic approach was applied. The methods used included 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis, numerical analysis of 16 and 23 rRNA gene ribotypes and DNA-DNA reassociation. In addition, all strains were included in a multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) study for species identification using housekeeping genes encoding the phenylalanyl-tRNA synthase alpha subunit (pheS) and RNA polymerase alpha subunit (rpoA). These results indicated that six out of eight porcine lactobacilli strains from Finland and the related L. sobrius strains, originating from porcine intestine from elsewhere, constitute a single species, L. amylovorus, and that the name L. sobrius should be considered as a later synonym of L. amylovorus. In the final part of this study, the adhesin FedF of Eschrichia coli F 18 fimbriae was characterized. The work aims at developing lactobacilli as a live mucosal vaccine vector for pigs against diseases caused by F 18 + E. coli. The F 18 fimbriae carrying E. coli strains colonize the microvilli of porcine small intestinal epithelial cells and cause post-weaning diarrhoea (PWD) and edema disease (ED) in pigs. It has been shown that oral immunization of weaned piglets with adhesins can induce a protective mucosal immune response. Naked FedF appeared to be very unstable but in our study it could be produced as a fusion protein with maltose binding protein (MBP). Specific adhesion to isolated porcine intestinal epithelial cells was demonstrated with MBP-FedF fusions as well as the ability of anti-MBP-FedF antibodies to prevent binding of E. coli F 18 to porcine epithelial cells...|$|R

Metal ions play vital roles in many cellular functions such as gene expression/regulation and DNA transcription and repair. The study of metal-protein-DNA/RNA interactions has been relatively unexplored. It is important {{to understand the}} role of metalloprotein interactions with DNA/RNA as this enhanced knowledge may lead to better understanding of diseases and therefore more effective treatments. A major milestone in the development of this field was the discovery of the cytotoxic properties of cisplatin in 1965 and its FDA approval in 1978. Since then, two other chemotherapeutic drugs containing platinum, carboplatin and oxaliplatin, have been used in the clinic. These three compounds are all bifunctional with the ligands surrounding platinum In the cis conformation and rearrangement of the ligands to the trans orientation results in a loss of cytotoxic properties due to rapid deactivation through binding to S-containing proteins. This enhanced reactivity yields new opportunities to study the reactions between proteins and DNA. One of the first crosslinking experiments used transplatin to crosslink NCp 7 to viral RNA in order to understand how/where the protein bound to RNA. We have studied the interaction between cis and trans dinuclear platinum complexes and the C-terminal zinc finger (ZF). The trans complex reacts at a faster rate than the cis isomer and causes N- terminal specific cleavage of the ZF. The dinuclear structure plays a critical role in the peptide cleavage as studies with transplatin (the mononuclear derivative) does not result in cleavage. Monofunctional trans platinum-nucleobase complexes (MPNs) {{serve as a model for}} the binding of transplatin to DNA. This provides an interesting opportunity to study their reactions with S-containing proteins, such as HIV 1 NCp 7. MPNs have been shown to bind to the C-terminal ZF of HIV 1 NCp 7, resulting in zinc ejection. This occurs through a two-step process where the nucleobase π-stacks with Trp 37 on the ZF, followed by covalent binding at the labile Cl site to Cys. MPNs have also shown antiviral activity in vitro. The labile Cl on MPNs reduces specificity of these compounds, as it leaves an available coordination site on the platinum center for binding to other <b>S-proteins</b> or DNA. Therefore, we have moved to an inert PtN 4 coordination sphere, [Pt(dien) L] 2 + (dien= diethylenetri- amine). Due to the strong bond between platinum and nitrogen, covalent reactions are highly unlikely to occur at rapid rates. The strength of the pi-stacking interaction between nucleobases (free and platinated) and the aromatic amino acid, tryptophan (Trp), showed an enhanced binding constant for platinated nucleobases. This was confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations as the difference in energy between the HOMO of Trp and the LUMO of the nucleobase was smaller for the platinum complex. The studies were extended to the Trp-containing C-terminal ZF of HIV 1 NCp 7 and an increase in association constant was seen compared to free Trp. Reaction of PtN 4 nucleobases compounds with a short amino acid sequence con- taining either Ala (no pi-stacking capabilities) or Trp (pi-stacking interactions) revealed an enhanced rate of reactivity for the Trp-containing peptide. This result supports the theory of a two-step reaction mechanism where the platinum-nucleobase complex recognizes the pep- tide through a pi-stacking interaction with Trp followed by covalent binding to the platinum center. The [Pt(dien) L] 2 + motif allows for systematic modification of the structural elements surrounding platinum in a search for the most effective compound. Methylation of the dien ligand should, in theory, increase lipophilicity of the compounds, however, due to 2 + charge of the compounds, this simple association does not hold true. Analysis of the cellular accumulation profiles showed little change in the uptake with the addition of methyl groups to the dien ligand, in agreement with the non-linear change in lipophilicity. Modification of L using different nucleobases allows for the tuning of the strength of the π-stacking interaction between Trp and the platinum complex. The addition of inosine (which lacks a H-bonding donor/acceptor at the C 2 position) resulted in a lower association constant with both N-AcTrp and the C-terminal zinc finger of HIV 1 NCp 7. Interestingly, the addition of xanthosine resulted in an ehanced pi-stacking interaction with the C-terminal zinc finger of HIV 1 NCp 7; likely as a results of the addition of a H-bonding donor (double-bonded O) at the C 2 position. The ability of PtN 4 nucleobase complexes to inhibit formation of the NCp 7 complexation with viral RNA was studied by mass spectrometry and gel electrophoresis. Dissociation of the NCp 7 -RNA complex was seen upon addition of PtN 4 compounds. These compounds were also able to retard formation of the NCp 7 -RNA complex when pre-incubated with the protein. These results have important implications as inhibition of complex formation between NCp 7 and viral RNA has negative implications for viral replication. Despite the success of platinum-nucleobase compounds, it is important to evaluate all potential pi-stacking ligands. A series of pyridine- and thiazole-based compounds were evaluated for the strength of the pi-stacking interaction with N-AcTrp and the C-terminal ZF of HIV 1 NCp 7. There was notable increase in association constant for the platinum- DMAP (4 -dimethylaminopyridine) complex compared to other ligands studied. This result highlights the importance of exploring multiple avenues for the design of specifically targeted inhibitors and further confirms the viability of the medicinal chemistry dual approach of target recognition (non-covalent) followed by target fixation (covalent) ...|$|R
40|$|S-{{proteins}} are proteins {{which form}} a regular structure (S-layer) {{on the outside}} of the cell walls of many bacteria. Two S-protein-encoding genes are located in opposite directions on a 6. 0 -kb segment of the chromosome of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 bacteria. Inversion of this chromosomal segment occurs through recombination between two regions with identical sequences, thereby interchanging the expressed and the silent genes. In this study, we show that the region involved in recombination also has a function in efficient <b>S-protein</b> production. Two promoter sequences are present in the <b>S-protein</b> gene expression site, although only the most downstream promoter (P- 1) is used to direct mRNA synthesis. <b>S-protein</b> mRNA directed by this promoter has a half-life of 15 min. Its untranslated leader can form a stable secondary structure in which the 5 ' end is base paired, whereas the ribosome- binding site is exposed. Truncation of this leader sequence results in a reduction in protein production, as shown by reporter gene analysis of Lactobacillus casei. The results obtained indicate that the untranslated leader sequence of <b>S-protein</b> mRNA is involved in efficient <b>S-protein</b> production...|$|E
40|$|The {{function}} of the S-layer, a regularly arranged structure {{on the outside of}} numerous bacteria, appears to be different for bacteria living in different environments. Almost no similarity exists between the primary sequences of S-proteins, although their amino acid composition is comparable. <b>S-protein</b> production is directed by single or multiple promoters in fron of the <b>S-protein</b> gene, yielding stable mRNAs. Most bacteria secrete S-proteins via the general secretory pathway (GSP). Translocation of <b>S-protein</b> across the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria sometimes occurs by S-protein-specific branches of the GSP. O-polysaccharide side-chains of the lipopolysaccharide component of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria appear to function as receptors for attachment of the S-layer. Silent <b>S-protein</b> genes have been found in Campylobacter fetus and Lactobaccillus acidophilus.

The <b>S-protein</b> complex with FP exhibits the pyrimidine specificity toward substrates in both reactions catalyzed by RNase S, transesterification and hydrolysis.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between ribonuclease (RNase) <b>S-protein</b> and S-peptide is examined by studying their limited oxidation within the RNase-S complex and free forms using radicals. The limited oxidation of the RNase-S complex and each component is effected through their reaction {{with a high}} flux of oxygen-based radicals generated by an electrical discharge within an electrospray ion source. Their exposure to radicals occurs on short millisecond time scales and has been consistently found not to cause any measurable structural damage or conformational change to proteins {{in a number of}} published reports. Consistent with these studies, S-peptide is preferentially protected from reactions with radicals under conditions in which it is bound to <b>S-protein.</b> Conversely, a region of <b>S-protein</b> comprising residues 96 - 100 constitutes the S-peptide binding domain based on its diminished reactivity with radicals within the RNase-S complex over the free <b>S-protein.</b> The results, for the first time, demonstrate the use of radicals generated by an electrical discharge to study protein complexes.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{expression}} of <b>S-protein</b> on the muscle from patients with X-linked vacuolated myopathy [characterized by the deposition of the complement C 5 b- 9 membrane attack complex (MAC) over abnormal muscle fibers] and controls by immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting. No expression was detected on muscle from controls and patients with X-linked vacuolated myopathy. These findings suggest that <b>S-protein</b> does not render the MAC inactive in X-linked vacuolated myopathy. This situation {{may be due to}} the fact that the pathways of MAC activation and the expression of <b>S-protein</b> in X-linked vacuolated myopathy are different from the ones observed in ischemic and/or necrotic, or immune diseases. These results emphasize the role of the membrane complement regulatory proteins (i. e., CD 59) in X-linked vacuolated myopathy...|$|E
40|$|Limited {{proteolysis}} of RNAase-Aa 1 (monodeamidated ribonuclease-A) by subtilisin {{results in}} the formation of an active RNAase-S type of derivative, namely RNAase-Aa 1 S. RNAase-Aa 1 S was chromatographically distinct from RNAase-S, but exhibited very nearly the same enzymic activity, antigenic conformation and susceptibility to trypsin as did RNAase-S. Fractionation of RNAase-Aa 1 S by trichloroacetic acid yielded RNAase-Aa 1 <b>S-protein</b> and RNAase-Aa 1 S-peptide, both of which are inactive by themselves, but regenerate active RNAase-Aa 1 S′ when mixed together. RNAase-Aa 1 S-peptide was identical with RNAase-S-peptide, whereas the protein part was distinct from that of RNAase-S-protein. Titration of RNAase-Aa 1 <b>S-protein</b> with S-peptide exhibited slight but noticeably weaker binding of the peptide to the deamidated <b>S-protein</b> as compared with that of native protein. Unlike the subtilisin digestion of RNAase-A, which gives nearly 100 % conversion into RNAase-S, the digestion of RNAase-Aa 1 gives only a 50 % conversion. The resistance of RNAase-Aa 1 to further subtilisin modification after 50 % conversion is apparently due to the interaction of RNAase-Aa 1 with its subtilisin-modified product. RNAase-S was also found to undergo activity and structural changes in acidic solutions, similar to those of RNAase-A. The initial reaction product (RNAase-Sa 1) isolated by chromatography was not homogeneous. Unlike the acid treatment of RNAase-A, which affected only the <b>S-protein</b> part, the acid treatment of RNAase-S affected both the <b>S-protein</b> and the S-peptide region of the molecule...|$|E

40|$|Infection of receptor-bearing cells by coronaviruses is {{mediated}} by their spike (S) proteins. The coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that causes {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS) infects cells expressing the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2). Here {{we show that}} codon optimization of the SARS-CoV <b>S-protein</b> gene substantially enhanced <b>S-protein</b> expression. We also found that two retroviruses, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and murine leukemia virus, both expressing green fluorescent protein and pseudotyped with SARS-CoV S protein or <b>S-protein</b> variants, efficiently infected HEK 293 T cells stably expressing ACE 2. Infection mediated by an <b>S-protein</b> variant whose cytoplasmic domain had been truncated and altered to include a fragment of the cytoplasmic tail of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 envelope glycoprotein was, in both cases, substantially more efficient than that mediated by wild-type S protein. Using S-protein-pseudotyped SIV, we found that the enzymatic activity of ACE 2 made no contribution to S-protein-mediated infection. Finally, we show that a soluble and catalytically inactive form of ACE 2 potently blocked infection by S-protein-pseudotyped retrovirus and by SARS-CoV. These results permit studies of SARS-CoV entry inhibitors without the use of live virus and suggest a candidate therapy for SARS...|$|E

Intranasal immunization of young mice with the Protollin-formulated vaccine elicited significant levels of antigen-specific lung IgA in contrast to mice immunized with the intramuscular vaccine in which no antigen-specific lung IgA was detected.

40|$|We {{developed}} a mouse model {{to compare the}} virulence of Campylobacter fetus strains with (S-plus) and without (S-minus) surface array protein (<b>S-protein)</b> capsules. In adult HA/ICR mice pretreated with ferric chloride, the LD 50 for S-plus strain 84 - 32 was 43. 3 times lower than its spontaneous S-minus mutant 84 - 54. Seven strains of inbred mice were no more susceptible than the outbred strain. In contrast to the findings with Salmonella typhimurium by others, 3 X 10 (7) CFU of strain 84 - 32 caused 90 % mortality in C 3 H/HeN (LPSn) mice and 40 % mortality in C 3 H/HeJ (LPSd) mice. High-grade bacteremia in HA/ICR mice occurred after oral challenge with S-plus C. fetus strains and continued for at least 2 d, but was not present in any mice challenged with S-minus strains. Bacteremia at 30 min after challenge was 51. 6 -fold lower in mice pretreated with 10 microliters of rabbit antiserum to purified <b>S-protein</b> than after pretreatment with normal rabbit serum. Challenge of mice {{with a mixture of}} S-minus strain 84 - 54 and free S-proteins at a concentration 31. 1 -fold higher than found in wild-type strain 84 - 32 caused 30 % mortality, compared with 0 % with strain 84 - 54 or <b>S-protein</b> alone. These findings in a mouse model point toward the central role of the <b>S-protein</b> in the pathogenesis of C. fetus infection.

40|$|Thirty-eight {{isolates}} of Lactobacillus gallinarum cultured {{from the}} crops of broiler chickens were screened {{for the presence}} of genes encoding S-layer proteins. All of the isolates had two <b>S-protein</b> genes, which were designated Lactobacillus gallinarum <b>S-protein</b> (lgs) genes. One gene in each isolate was either lgsA or lgsB. The Lactobacillus isolates were further characterized by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of DNA digests, which grouped the isolates into 17 genotypes (strains). The second gene in each of eight representative strains was sequenced and shown to differ among strains (lgsC, lgsD, lgsE, lgsF, lgsG, lgsH, and lgsI). The genome of each strain thus encoded a common <b>S-protein</b> (encoded by either lgsA or lgsB) and a strain-specific <b>S-protein.</b> The extraction of cell surface proteins from cultures of the eight strains showed that each strain produced a single <b>S-protein</b> that was always encoded by the strain-specific lgs gene. Two of the strains were used to inoculate chickens maintained in a protected environment which were Lactobacillus-free prior to inoculation. DNAs and RNAs extracted from the digesta of the chickens were used for PCR and reverse transcription-PCR, respectively, to demonstrate the presence and transcription of lgs genes in vivo. In both cases, only the strain-specific gene was transcribed. Both of the strains adhered to the crop epithelium, consistent with published data predicting that S-proteins of lactobacilli are adhesins. The results of this study provide a basis for the investigation of gene duplication and sequence variation as mechanisms by which bacterial strains of the same species can share the same habitat...|$|E

Recombinant DNA technology was used to produce a fusion protein having three parts: carrier, spacer, and target. The two carriers used were the first 15 residues of S-peptide (S 15) and a mutant S 15 in which Asp 14 had been changed to Asn (D 14 N S 15). The spacer consisted of three proline residues and a four-residue sequence recognized by factor Xa protease. The target was beta-galactosidase. The interaction between the S-peptide portion of the fusion protein and immobilized <b>S-protein</b> allowed for affinity purification of the fusion protein under denaturing (S 15 as carrier) or nondenaturing (D 14 N S 15 as carrier) conditions. A sensitive method was developed to detect the fusion protein after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis by its ribonuclease activity following activation with <b>S-protein.</b> S-peptide has distinct advantages over existing carriers in fusion proteins in that it combines a small size (> or = 15 residues), a tunable affinity for ligand (Kd > or = 10 (- 9) M), and a high sensitivity of detection (> or = 10 (- 16) mol in a gel) ...|$|E
