50|$|An ultrasensitive <b>switch</b> {{has been}} <b>engineered</b> by {{combining}} a simple linear signaling protein (N-WASP) with {{one to five}} SH3 interaction modules that have autoinhibitory and cooperative properties. Addition of a single SH3 module created a switch that was activated in a linear fashion by exogenous SH3-binding peptide. Increasing number of domains increased ultrasensitivity. A construct with three SH3 modules was activated with an apparent Hill coefficient of 2.7 and a construct with five SH3 module was activated with an apparent Hill coefficient of 3.9.|$|R
50|$|After {{the initial}} batch of airfields was {{completed}} using SMT, the Army aviation <b>engineers</b> <b>switched</b> {{almost exclusively to}} another surfacing material known as prefabricated hessian (burlap) surfacing (PBS). Light and easily transportable, PBS did not create the dust problem encountered with SMT fields. Made of an asphalt-impregnated jute delivered in rolls 300 feet in length and 36 inches or 43 inches in width, PBS was laid in overlapping layers to produce a dust-free fair weather surface. It was also common to build airstrips using both SMT and PBS, laying SMT on top.|$|R
5000|$|The Channel 26 license {{has been}} in {{existence}} since the 1960s, when it was utilized by WNYP-TV from 1966 to 1969. The station's majority shareholder was Lowell W.

40|$|AbstractRibo{{switches}} {{are natural}} RNA-based genetic switches that sense small-molecule metabolites and regulate in response {{the expression of}} the corresponding metabolic genes. Within the last years, several engineered riboswitches have been developed that act on various stages of gene expression. These <b>switches</b> can be <b>engineered</b> to respond to any ligand of choice and are therefore of great interest for synthetic biology. In this review, we present an overview of engineered riboswitches and discuss their application in conditional gene expression systems.

50|$|Initially, {{communications}} between posts and controls were made using former Army-issue head-and-breast communication sets via above-ground telephone lines, these being manually <b>switched</b> by telephone <b>engineers</b> prior to use. Army head-and-breast sets were replaced in 1964 by metal housed “Teletalk” units which only permitted one-way communications when the push-to-talk switch was depressed. The Teletalk units also used manually switched telephone lines, but with integral transistorisation to boost transmission and reception power. In 1981 a new design of Teletalk (AD8010) {{was introduced by}} British Telecom together with underground, permanently wired, landline connections that were hardened against the effects of electromagnetic pulse (EMP) from nuclear bursts.|$|R
50|$|Siemens Brothers Ltd (later {{taken over}} by Associated Electrical Industries Ltd, who renamed each section {{accordingly}} e.g. AEI Telecoms) had set up an electronic switching lab at Blackheath in London.

40|$|Applications of {{conditional}} gene expression, {{whether for}} therapeutic or basic research purposes, are increasingly requiring mammalian gene control systems that exhibit far tighter control properties. While numerous approaches {{have been used}} to improve the widely used Tet-regulatory system, many applications, particularly with respect to the engineering of synthetic gene networks, will require a broader range of tightly performing gene control systems. Here, a generically applicable approach is described that utilizes intronically encoded siRNA on the relevant transregulator construct, and siRNA sequence-specific tags on the reporter construct, to minimize basal gene activity in the off-state of a range of common gene control systems. To demonstrate tight control of residual expression the approach was successfully used to conditionally express the toxic proteins RipDD and Linamarase. The intronic siRNA concept was also extended to create a new generation of compact, single-vector, autoinducible siRNA vectors. Finally, using improved regulation systems a mammalian epigenetic toggle <b>switch</b> was <b>engineered</b> that exhibited superior in vitro and in vivo induction characteristics in mice compared to the equivalent non-intronic system...|$|R

50|$|On the B5500, either Processor A or Processor B {{could be}} {{designated}} as Processor 1 by a <b>switch</b> on the <b>engineer's</b> panel, {{with the other}} processor being Processor 2; both processors shared main memory and had hardware access to the I/O processors hence the peripherals, but only Processor 1 could respond to peripheral interrupts. When a job on Processor 2 required an operating system service it would be rescheduled on Processor 1, which was responsible for both initiating I/O processor activity and responding to interrupts indicating completion. In practice, this meant that while user jobs could run on either Processor 1 or Processor 2 and could access intrinsic library routines that didn't require kernel support, the operating system would schedule them on the latter whenever possible.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{identifies the}} problems encountered in transmitting {{voice over the}} Internet and proposes approaches to solve these problems. The current Internet is not very suitable for transmitting real-time data because its underlying protocols and <b>switches</b> were only <b>engineered</b> to transmit non-real time data. The problems posed by voice over the Internet are studied by conducting a series of experiments. These problems caused by high loss, large delay, and jitter will seriously affect the transmission quality. A good design thus needs to combine different components that solve these problems together. Silence removal and compression is used to reduce bandwidth usage. Jitter buffers are used to smooth the burstiness in the received stream caused by the network. To conceal loss, we investigate existing methods and propose two new nonredundant reconstruction algorithms based on a simple but effective average reconstruction scheme. One is to apply adaptive filtering on top of average reco [...] ...|$|R

RNA aptamers specific for small ligands and a trans-activation-responsive (TAR) -RNA were connected by random RNA sequences. RNAs that were allosterically bound to a trans-activator of transcription (Tat) -peptide in response to ligands were selected by repeated negative and positive selection in the absence and presence of the ligands, respectively.

40|$|SNi-like mechanisms, {{which involve}} front-face leaving group {{departure}} and nucleophile approach, {{have been observed}} experimentally and computationally in chemical and enzymatic substitution at α-glycosyl electrophiles. Since SNi-like, SN 1 and SN 2 substitution pathways can be energetically comparable, <b>engineered</b> <b>switching</b> could be feasible. Here, engineering of Sulfolobus solfataricus β-glycosidase, which originally catalyzed double SN 2 substitution, changed its mode to SNi-like. Destruction of the first SN 2 nucleophile through E 387 Y mutation created a β-stereoselective catalyst for glycoside synthesis from activated substrates, despite lacking a nucleophile. The pH profile, kinetic and mutational analyses, mechanism-based inactivators, X-ray structure and subsequent metadynamics simulations together suggest recruitment of substrates by π-sugar interaction and reveal a quantum mechanics-molecular mechanics (QM/MM) free-energy landscape for the substitution reaction {{that is similar to}} those of natural, SNi-like glycosyltransferases.
