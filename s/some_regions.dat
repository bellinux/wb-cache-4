In an {{expanding}} universe, an observer may find that <b>some</b> <b>regions</b> of the past cannot be observed ("particle horizon"), and <b>some</b> <b>regions</b> of the future cannot be influenced (event horizon). Even in flat Minkowski space, when described by an accelerated observer (Rindler space), there will be horizons associated with a semi-classical radiation known as Unruh radiation.|$|E

5|$|The {{size of the}} Universe is {{somewhat}} difficult to define. According to a restrictive definition, the Universe is everything within our connected spacetime that could {{have a chance to}} interact with us and vice versa. According to the general theory of relativity, <b>some</b> <b>regions</b> of space may never interact with ours even in the lifetime of the Universe due to the finite speed of light and the ongoing expansion of space. For example, radio messages sent from Earth may never reach <b>some</b> <b>regions</b> of space, even if the Universe were to exist forever: space may expand faster than light can traverse it.|$|E
5|$|East Antarctica {{is a cold}} {{region with}} a ground base above sea level and {{occupies}} most of the continent. This area is dominated by small accumulations of snowfall which becomes ice and thus eventually seaward glacial flows. The mass balance of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet {{as a whole is}} thought to be slightly positive (lowering sea level) or near to balance. However, increased ice outflow has been suggested in <b>some</b> <b>regions.</b>|$|E

5000|$|An {{example of}} a moment measure is the first moment measure of a point process, often called mean measure or {{intensity}} measure, which gives the expected or average number of points of the point process being located in <b>some</b> <b>region</b> of space.

5|$|Ocean {{circulation}} patterns have {{a strong}} influence on climate and weather and, in turn, the food supply of both humans and other organisms. Scientists have warned of the possibility, {{under the influence of}} climate change, of a sudden alteration in circulation patterns of ocean currents that could drastically alter the climate in <b>some</b> <b>regions</b> of the globe. Ten per cent of the world's population—about 600 million people—live in low-lying areas vulnerable to sea level rise.|$|E

50|$|One {{realization}} {{refers to}} the observation of an object (Zeno's arrow, or any quantum particle) as it leaves <b>some</b> <b>region</b> of space. In the 20th century, the trapping (confinement) of a particle in <b>some</b> <b>region</b> by its observation outside the region was considered as nonsensical, indicating some non-completeness of quantum mechanics. Even as late as 2001, confinement by absorption was considered as a paradox. Later, similar effects of the suppression of Raman scattering was considered an expected effect, not a paradox at all. The absorption of a photon at some wavelength, {{the release of a}} photon (for example one that has escaped from some mode of a fiber), or even the relaxation of a particle as it enters <b>some</b> <b>region,</b> are all processes that can be interpreted as measurement. Such a measurement suppresses the transition, and is called the Zeno effect in the scientific literature.|$|R

The Eastern and northern European countries have a tradition for separate winter uniforms rather than oversuits. During the Second World War, the Waffen-SS went a step further, developing reversible uniforms with separate schemes for summer and autumn, as well as white winter oversuits.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{factorial}} moment {{measure of a}} point process coincides with its first moment measure or intensity measure, which gives the expected or average number of points of the point process located in <b>some</b> <b>region</b> of space. In general, {{if the number of}} points in <b>some</b> <b>region</b> is considered as a random variable, then the moment factorial measure of this region is the {{factorial moment}} of this random variable. [...] Factorial moment measures completely characterize a wide class of point processes, which means they can be used to uniquely identify a point process.|$|R

5|$|Another {{effect of}} the common European {{currency}} is that differences in prices—in particular in price levels—should decrease because {{of the law of}} one price. Differences in prices can trigger arbitrage, i.e., speculative trade in a commodity across borders purely to exploit the price differential. Therefore, prices on commonly traded goods are likely to converge, causing inflation in <b>some</b> <b>regions</b> and deflation in others during the transition. Some evidence of this has been observed in specific eurozone markets.|$|E

The Company for purposes of liquidation maintained its formal existence until 1874. India was thereafter directly ruled by the Crown as a colony of the United Kingdom, and officially known as the Empire of India after 1876.
