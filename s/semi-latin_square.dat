40|$|AbstractThere is {{a regular}} graph with 12 {{vertices}} and valency 6 which has three mutually orthogonal 1 -factorizations. Any pair of these {{can be interpreted as}} a Howell design or <b>semi-Latin</b> <b>square.</b> The automorphism group of the graph is A 5 × Z 2; it preserves the above three 1 -factorizations as a set, interchanging two of them. This can be interpreted as a <b>semi-Latin</b> <b>square</b> isomorphic to its transpose with a unique Latin square orthogonal to it...|$|E
40|$|Let n and k be integers, with n> 1 and k> 0. An (n×n) /k <b>semi-Latin</b> <b>square</b> S is an n × n array, whose {{entries are}} k-subsets of an nk-set, {{the set of}} symbols of S, such that each symbol of S is in exactly one entry in each row and exactly one entry in each column of S. Semi-Latin squares form an {{interesting}} class of combinatorial objects which are useful {{in the design of}} comparative experiments. We say that an (n × n) /k <b>semi-Latin</b> <b>square</b> S is uniform if there is a constant µ such that any two entries of S, not in the same row or column, intersect in exactly µ symbols (in which case k = µ(n − 1)). We prove that a uniform (n × n) /k <b>semi-Latin</b> <b>square</b> is Schur-optimal in the class of (n × n) /k semi-Latin squares, and so is optimal (for use as an experimental design) with respect to a very wide range of statistical optimality criteria. We give a simple construction to make an (n×n) /k <b>semi-Latin</b> <b>square</b> S from a transitive permutation group G of degree n and order nk, and show how certain properties of S can be determined from permutation group properties of G. If G is 2 -transitive then S is uniform, and this provides us with Schur-optimal semi-Latin squares for many values of n and k for which optimal (n × n) /k semi-Latin squares were previously unknown for any optimality criterion. The existence of a uniform (n × n) /((n − 1) µ) <b>semi-Latin</b> <b>square</b> for all 1 integers µ> 0 is shown to be equivalent to the existence of n − 1 mutually orthogonal Latin squares (MOLS) of order n. Although there are not even two MOLS of order 6, we construct uniform, and hence Schur-optimal, (6 × 6) /(5 µ) semi-Latin squares for all integers µ> 1. ...|$|E
40|$|An (n × n) /k <b>semi-Latin</b> <b>square</b> is an n × n {{square array}} in which nk {{distinct}} symbols (representing treatments) {{are placed in}} such a way that there are exactly k symbols in each cell (row-column intersection) and each symbol occurs once in each row and once in each column. Semi-Latin squares form a class of row-column designs generalising Latin squares, and have applications in areas including the design of agricultural experiments, consumer testing, and via their duals, human-machine interaction. In the present paper, new theoretical and computational methods are developed to determine optimal or efficient (n × n) /k semi-Latin squares for values of n and k for which such semi-Latin squares were previously unknown. The concept of subsquares of uniform semi-Latin squares is studied, new applications of the DESIGN package for GAP are developed, and exact algebraic computational techniques for comparing efficiency measures of binary equireplicate block designs are described. Applications include the complete enumeration of the (4 × 4) /k semi-Latin squares for k = 2, [...] ., 10, and the determination of those that are A-, D- and E-optimal, the construction of efficient (6 × 6) /k semi-Latin squares for k = 4, 5, 6, and counterexamples to a long-standing conjecture of R.
