The Upanishad states that these loners have advanced far in their path of reaching Brahman – they are pure in mind, they are the Paramahamsas.|$|E

Lisa chooses to enter, takes a trip to Springfield Forest, and is inspired to write her essay when she sees the forest's natural beauty and when an eagle lands right by the branch she is <b>sitting</b> <b>under.</b> Lisa's article is approved for entry in the national finals in Washington, D.C. after the contest judge observes Homer's poor vocabulary and realizes that he could not have written Lisa's essay for her.|$|E
5|$|In the Lord High Steward's Court, a {{group of}} Lords Triers, <b>sitting</b> <b>under</b> the {{chairmanship}} of the Lord High Steward, acted as judge and jury. By custom the number of Triers was not fewer than 23, so that a majority was a minimum of 12, but in fact the number ranged from 20 to 35. The power to choose which peers served as Triers lay with the Crown and was sometimes subject to abuse, as only those peers who agreed with the monarch's position would be summoned to the Court of the Lord High Steward, thereby favouring the desired verdict. This practice was ended by the Treason Act 1695, passed during the reign of King William III. The Act required that all peers be summoned as Triers. All subsequent trials were held before the full House of Lords.|$|E

As they leave, Candace spots them and it brings back upsetting memories of never being able to bust the boys. She takes her mother Linda to the museum where the boys leave, right before Linda can see them.|$|E
5|$|The video commences with Swift, clothed {{by a black}} {{sweater and}} jeans, walking through a {{university}} campus and spotting Gaston <b>sitting</b> <b>under</b> a tree, reading a textbook. As they make eye contact, the video then transitions to an earlier era, in an seemingly 18th century castle (though the castle was built in 1973), where Swift stands, wearing a corset and gown, and performs in a balcony. After, Gaston enters a party and sees Swift, wearing an elaborate gown, conversing with other females. The two, along with others, engage in ballroom dancing. After dancing, Gaston whispers into Swift's ear and Swift is then seen pondering at night with a lantern. She meets with Gaston and the two walk, hold hands, and feed a horse by a well. The two then go their separate paths. Afterward, Swift stands in the balcony, looking out from the window. She sees Gaston running toward her and immediately runs down the staircase. Swift and Gaston meet each other and hold each other. The video then transcends back into modern-day as Gaston walks toward Swift and they gaze into each other's eyes, where the video concludes. Cut-scenes feature ballroom dancing and Swift performing in the balcony setting. To date, the video has over 400 million views on YouTube.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurposeThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} to test whether blocking the serotonin receptors by intravenous [IV] ondansetron; can help in reducing the hypotensive bradycardic events [HB events] associated with shoulder arthroscopy done in the <b>sitting</b> position <b>under</b> interscalene plexus block [ISB]. MethodsOne hundred and fifty patients, scheduled for shoulder arthroscopy in the <b>sitting</b> position <b>under</b> ISB, were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three groups receiving either: 4 mg ondansetron, or 8 mg ondansetron or saline. ResultsIV injection of ondansetron 4 mg or 8 mg significantly reduced the incidence of HB events from 20. 4 % in the saline group to 6. 1 % after injection of 4 mg ondansetron and 6 % after injection of 8 mg ondansetron; p value [0. 030]. ConclusionIV ondansetron either 4 mg or 8 mg reduces the HB events during shoulder arthroscopy in the <b>sitting</b> position <b>under</b> ISB...|$|R

Meliboeus and Corydon discuss whether {{it is appropriate to}} compose such a poem in a rustic style. Corydon mentions that his brother, Amyntas, also writes similar poems/songs. This leads Meliboeus to remind Corydon that he used to tell Amyntas to abandon his compositions and to concentrate on his agricultural duties. However, Corydon says that times have now changed: there is a new divine emperor.|$|E

Hodgson with his friend, S. J. Davey had staged fake séances for educating the public (including SPR members). Davey gave <b>sittings</b> <b>under</b> an assumed name, duplicating the phenomena produced by Eglinton, and then proceeded {{to point out to}} the sitters {{the manner in which they}} had been deceived.

The platoon divided into three lines, one for each section of the platoon, the outboard two sections <b>sitting</b> <b>under</b> the protection of the troop well's armoured decks, the centre section crouched on the low seating bench down the middle. Despite the wires holding the craft to a fender, the LCA rolled with the motion of the ship.|$|E

Jain College except for examinations and used his free time {{to work for a}} few months as an assistant editor at a local newspaper. He began speaking in public at the annual Sarva Dharma Sammelan (Meeting of all faiths) held at Jabalpur, organised by the Taranpanthi Jain community into which he was born, and participated there from 1951 to 1968. He resisted his parents' pressure to get married.

25|$|The early A-3 {{variants}} had {{a crew of}} three: pilot, bombardier/navigator (BN) and crewman/navigator (aka: third crewman). An unusual cockpit configuration {{was incorporated}} with the three crew <b>sitting</b> <b>under</b> a framed canopy. In the raised compartment, the pilot and bombardier/navigator sat in a side-by-side arrangement with the pilot's station {{on the port side}} having full flight controls. On initial variants, a third crew member, who also acted as a gunner for the twin tail-mounted 20mm cannons that briefly equipped the original bomber version of the A3D/A-3A (removed and replaced by ECM equipment), sat behind the pilot in an aft-facing seat. The third crewman station had the sextant for celestial navigation and the defensive electronic counter measures equipment. Later electronic reconnaissance variants could accommodate a crew of seven with the flight crew consisting of a pilot, co-pilot and navigator plus four electronic systems operators occupying stations in the former bomb bay in the spacious fuselage.|$|E

25|$|The Kirkwall scroll is a floor cloth which {{contains}} many masonic symbols, many more opaque images, and cryptic writing which may either be a code or badly painted Hebrew. It {{hangs on the}} west wall of the temple of Lodge Kirkwall Kilwinning No. 38(2) in Orkney, but is too long to be completely displayed. It is 18ft 6in long and 5ft 6in wide, and is composed of a full-width central strip stitched at each side to two half-width side strips. The left border appears to show the wanderings of the Israelites before they arrived in Egypt, and reads from top to bottom. The right shows their wanderings in the wilderness after the Exodus, with the route marked in years from 1 to 46, and branching many times at the end. The central cloth contains seven painted scenes and tableaux. The bottom scene shows an altar flanked by two pillars, all surrounded by more or less familiar masonic symbols. Working upwards, the second has an altar surrounded by {{a different set of}} symbols, the third has the altar and pillars together with the cherubim present on the arms of the Antient Grand Lodge of England, the Grand Lodge of Ireland and the United Grand Lodge of England. Above this is a schematic of the tabernacle of the Ark of the Covenant, followed by what may be the last judgement. The sixth shows a cross atop a pyramid, surmounted by a rainbow, surrounded by masonic and alchemical symbols, and at the top a naked woman, assumed by early authors to be Eve, <b>sitting</b> <b>under</b> a tree surrounded by animals. In the distance is a sea or lake full of fish, and beyond this are mountains. The whole is painted in oil, mainly in pale blue. In the top tableau the woman, fish and animals are pink, the sea green, and the tree and mountains brown.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{being caught}} {{unprepared}} by the attack, Sherman rallied his division and conducted an orderly, fighting retreat that helped avert a disastrous Union rout.

In what would become one of the most notable conversations of the war, Sherman said simply: [...] "Well, Grant, we've had the devil's own day, haven't we?" [...] After a puff of his cigar, Grant replied calmly: [...] "Yes. Lick 'em tomorrow, though." [...] Sherman proved instrumental to the successful Union counterattack of April 7, 1862. At Shiloh, Sherman was wounded twice—in the hand and shoulder—and had three horses shot out from under him. His performance was praised by Grant and Halleck and after the battle, and he was promoted to major general of volunteers, effective May 1, 1862.|$|E
