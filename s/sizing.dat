Life-history theory predicts that increased environmental stress {{results in a}} shift in reproductive allocation from offspring quantity to quality and a stronger trade-off between egg <b>size</b> and clutch <b>size.</b> To test this prediction, we investigated patterns of variation in life-history traits (i. e. age, body <b>size,</b> clutch <b>size</b> and egg <b>size)</b> among four populations of Bufo andrewsi from Baoxing County, western China, at different altitudes. We found that body <b>size,</b> age, egg <b>size</b> and total reproductive output, but not clutch <b>size,</b> differed between populations. Clutch <b>size</b> and total reproductive output increased with female <b>size</b> and age. However, egg <b>size</b> decreased with female <b>size</b> and did not change with female age. The egg <b>size</b> and clutch <b>size</b> trade-off was evident for all populations except at lowest altitude, {{and the strength of}} trade-off between egg <b>size</b> and clutch <b>size</b> increased with altitude.

25|$|When a {{cartridge}} is fired, {{the internal}} pressure expands {{the case to}} fit the chamber in a process called obturation. To allow ease of chambering the cartridge when it is reloaded, the case is swaged back to size. Competition shooters, using bolt action rifles {{that are capable of}} camming a tight case into place, often resize only the neck of the cartridge, called neck <b>sizing,</b> as opposed to the normal full length resizing process. Neck <b>sizing</b> is only useful for cartridges to be re-fired in the same firearm, as the brass may be slightly oversized in some dimensions for other chambers, but the precise fit of case to chamber will allow greater consistency and therefore greater potential accuracy. Some believe that neck <b>sizing</b> will permit a larger number of reloads with a given case in contrast to full size resizing, although this is controversial. Semi-automatic rifles and rifles with SAAMI minimum chamber dimensions often require a special small base resizing die, that sizes further down the case than normal dies, and allows for more reliable feeding.|$|E
