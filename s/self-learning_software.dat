40|$|This paper {{describes}} a <b>self-learning</b> <b>software</b> agent who collects and learns knowledge from {{the web and}} also exchanges her knowledge via dialogues with the users. The agent is built on top of information extraction, web mining, question answering and dialogue system technologies, and users can freely formulate their questions within the gossip domain and obtain the answers in multiple ways: textual response, graph-based visualization of the related concepts and speech output...|$|E
40|$|Modular {{fixturing}} is {{an important}} concept in advanced manufacturing and tool design courses in the Industrial Technology (IT) curriculum. The wide variety of tooling and fixtures are difficult to cover within a single semester (or quarter) through traditional methods, especially if consideration of related topics on cutting tools or geometric dimensioning and tolerancing are included. Therefore <b>self-learning</b> multimedia <b>software</b> entitled ToolTRAIN © for modular fixturing applications was developed to address this need. The original concept to develop the ToolTRAIN © courseware evolved from an interest in courseware applications available in manufacturing technology curriculum. The lack of multimedia based tutorials in this area was the impetus for developing this courseware. Although multimedia tutorials and courseware tools can greatly enhance learning in ways that traditional instruction can not, {{research has shown that}} poor design of the tutorial and user interface (e. g., tutorial fails to run from the CD, or is incompatible across multiple operating system platforms) can limit its use by students. ToolTRAIN © Plus addresses these issues and was developed and tested on multiple platforms, and the user interface developed using feedback fro...|$|R
40|$|SLIM is a {{prototype}} interactive multimedia <b>self-learning</b> linguistic <b>software</b> for foreign language stu- dents at beginner-false beginner level. It {{allows students to}} work both in an autonomous self-direct- ed mode or in a way of programmed learning in which the process of self-instruction is pre-pro- grammed and monitored. In this latter mode it incorporates assessment and evaluation tools in order to behave as an automatic tutor. It is organized into three basic components: audiovisual materials; a linguistic database recording all language material in text format; the supervisor. Audiovisual mate- rials are partially taken from commercially available courses; the linguistic database is a highly sophisticated classification of all words and utterances of the course, both in written and spoken form, from all possible linguistic aspects. The supervisor is both an attractive, enjoyable and strong- ly pedagogically based software that allows the user to work on language materials. The most out- standing feature of SLIM {{is the use of}} speech analysis and recognition which is a fundamental aspect of all second language learning programmes. We also assume that a learning model can be repre- sented by a finite state automaton made up by a fixed number of possible states – corresponding to the macro and microlevels at which the student’s competence may be modelled – each one being internally constituted by the actual linguistic objects of knowledge of the language that make it up...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{paper is}} {{addressing}} {{the needs of}} the universities regarding qualification of students as future R&D specialists in efficient techniques for successfully running innovation process. It briefly describes the program of a novel one-semester-course of 150 hours in new product development and inventive problem solving with TRIZ methodology, offered for the master students at the Beuth University of Applied Sciences in Berlin. The paper outlines multi-source educational approach, which includes a new product development project (about 50 % of the complete course), theory, practical work, <b>self-learning</b> with the <b>software</b> tools for computer-aided innovation, and demonstrates examples of the students work. The research part analyses the learning experience, identifies the factors that impact the innovation and problem solving performance of the students, and underlines the main difficulties faced by the students in the course. It describes a method for measurement of education efficiency and compares the results with educational experience in the industry. The presented results can help universities to establish the education in new product development or to improve its performance...|$|R
40|$|Computer systems {{become more}} {{powerful}} and more popular. It is not easy for computer users to comprehend how computers work because of their complex properties like as black box. It is necessary to understand the internal structure and behavior of computer. We have developed a visual simulator written in Java, which can illustrate graphical computer structure, interpret sample assembly programs, demonstrate data transfer between registers of CPU and memory, and visualize computer's internal mechanism. This paper describes that our visual simulator will be a useful tool at computer introductory courses. It can realize graphical demonstration for lecturers as well as <b>self-learning</b> <b>software</b> for students...|$|E
40|$|Some {{research}} on new technologies for music learning {{carried out in}} 2005 is reported here. Going beyond the usage of easy <b>self-learning</b> <b>software,</b> these works brought to experimentation of explorative trial-and-error teaching methodologies based on the latest computer music applications. The two reported projects were designed with two different approaches (action-research and scientific experimentation), in both cases involving school-aged pupils (9 - 11 years old) as research subjects. The first piece of research gave as a result a series of learning units, together with a selection of existing software and literature, and {{a report of the}} action-research. The second piece of research reported some scientific data on variation of musical abilities according to time and to the level of presence of the information technology in teaching. Also, the two inquiries brought up some important points for future development of research in this field...|$|E

5000|$|Developed by {{the team}} led by Dr. Wes Cobb of Behavioral Recognition Systems, Inc., (BRS Labs) this <b>self-learning,</b> non-rule-based A.I. <b>software</b> takes the data from video cameras and {{continuously}} classifies objects and events that it sees. The system is called AISight (as in [...] "A.I. Sight"). It has been deployed by government agencies, transit authorities, police departments and is rolling into commercial use. For example, a person crossing a street is one classification. A group of people is another classification. A vehicle is one classification, but with continued learning a public bus would be discriminated from a small truck and that from a motorcycle. With increasing sophistication, the system recognizes patterns in human behavior. For example, it might observe that individuals pass through a controlled access door one at a time. The door opens, the person presents their proximity card or tag, the person passes through and the door closes. This pattern of activity, observed repeatedly, forms a basis for what is normal {{in the view of}} the camera observing that scene. Now if an authorized person opens the door but a second [...] "tail-gating" [...] unauthorized person grabs the door before it closes and passes through, that is the sort of anomaly that would create an alert. This type of analysis is much more complex than the rule-based analytics. While the rule-based analytics work mainly to detect intruders into areas where no one is normally present at defined times of day, the behavioral analytics works where people are active to detect things that are out of the ordinary.|$|R
