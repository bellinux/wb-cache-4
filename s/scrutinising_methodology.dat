40|$|AbstractPreviously, {{life cycle}} {{assessment}} (LCA) focussing on principles or applications has been considerably reviewed. Still, an up-to-date review on LCA methodology development (rather than application) in a chronological order which embraces all life-cycle phases is lacking. The objectives of this article include <b>scrutinising</b> <b>methodology</b> development of conventional LCA phase by phase, providing clarification on goal and scope definition and life cycle inventory (LCI) analysis, discussing recent substantial development on life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methodology and interpretation, and introducing an LCA framework for marine photovoltaic (PV) systems. For the study presented here, literature on LCA methodology development was categorised into Sample Groups A, B and C, comprising 15 review articles published in the last decade, 95 pieces of other literature types (with 83 % journal articles), and 38 additional materials necessary for complementing an in-depth discussion respectively. A threefold analysis was performed to scrutinise and compare the literature in these sample groups. The analysis shows that for Sample Group A, the focus has steered from overarching LCA of all-embracing life cycle phases to single phase and then sole engagement with a specific topic; and for Sample Group B, 44 % has reported the scientific endeavour on LCIA compared to other life cycle phases. Following clarification on system boundary, cut-off and existing LCI approaches including attributional, consequential, process based, input–output (IO) based etc., the methodology development of impact categories (covering impacts of water use, noise and working environment), uncertainty and sensitivity analyses are discussed. In addition, classification involving series and parallel mechanisms, LCIA development for space use, odour, non-ionising radiation and thermal pollution, rebound effects, renewability of resources, dynamic of environment and future scenario modelling in LCA context are identified as research needs and areas for future development. In compliance with ISO Standards {{and based on the}} findings, an LCA framework for marine PV systems (which exemplify the state-of-the-art development of renewable and sustainable energy in marine industry) is introduced to enhance the practical applicability and usefulness of the findings to LCA researchers...|$|E
40|$|The {{supposedly}} already-degraded {{state of}} coral reef ecosystems is sometimes {{claimed to be}} a reason why anthropogenic global warming will {{have a major impact on}} the reefs, i. e. they are already close to extinction and can easily be tipped over the edge. Recently published work by Pandolfi et al. (2003) in Science has outlined a method for measuring the decline of coral reef ecosystems throughout the world according to which the outer and inner Great Barrier Reef (GBR) are claimed to be 28 % and 36 % respectively, down the path towards ecological extinction. This is a highly significant claim given the important status of the GBR, so the result deserves attention and objective scrutiny. This paper sets out to <b>scrutinise</b> the <b>methodology</b> used by Pandolfi et al. (2003) under four headings: (i) the guilds are poorly weighted and focus largely on human target species, rather than species that are ecologically important to reefs; (ii) the numerical scale used to “measure ” the state of the reefs is not well-founded and hence distorts the result; (iii) the analysis fails to recognize that the GBR is of relatively recent origin and therefore never existed in the pre-human/pristine cultural period as defined by PAN; and (iv) in many cases it is doubtful that the literature cited demonstrates the claimed decline in ecological state. It is concluded that the work of Pandolfi et al. (2003) cannot be used as justification that the Great Barrier Reef has lost significant resilience, or that it is particularly susceptible to global warming because of its present supposedly degraded state...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{study is}} an {{exploratory}} {{study of a}} media event in Australia based on the publication of two separate systematic analyses of complementary medicine (CM) therapies. The objective {{of the study was}} to measure the scientific quality of Australian newspaper media reports about two international peer-reviewed research papers reporting results on complementary medicines published in biomedical journals during Feb/March 2007. For purposes of clarity, we refer to the papers as the 2 ̆ 7 Antioxidant Study 2 ̆ 7 (Bjelakovic et al 2007) and the 2 ̆ 7 Prenatal Multivitamin Study 2 ̆ 7 (Goh et al 2007). Methods: We sourced articles that were published about the two research papers in mainstream metropolitan and national Australian newspapers during February and March 2007. We then applied a model of analysis called the Index of Scientific Quality (ISQ) to measure the scientific quality of the news reports. Results: We identified 14 newspaper articles and one newswire article about the Antioxidant Study and two newspaper articles about the Prenatal Multivitamin Study. Of the seven ISQ criteria, 2 ̆ 7 validity 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 precision 2 ̆ 7 were rated the least adequate, 2 ̆ 7 important consequences 2 ̆ 7 of the research were reported partially in the Antioxidant Study and wholly in the Prenatal Multivitamin Study, and 2 ̆ 7 opinion from fact 2 ̆ 7 was adequate in the majority of articles. Conclusion: This exploratory study conveyed an overall inadequacy in the scientific quality of the newspaper reporting about the two CM studies in major metropolitan and national Australian newspapers. Whilst we found that journalists were careful to attribute opinions to their sources, their reports conveyed a very limited understanding of biomedical research methodologies and a subsequent incapacity to <b>scrutinise</b> these <b>methodologies</b> with rigour...|$|R
40|$|As {{a result}} of various social and {{economic}} factors, many historic townscapes in the United Kingdom and elsewhere have declined over the last half century. There have been many attempts throughout the world to revitalise such urban heritage areas, but the actual effectiveness of few of these schemes has been systematically evaluated. Good public policy choices would greatly benefit from such evaluation. The UK's Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) decided in 1999 that their Townscape Heritage Initiatives would be an exception. A research team from Oxford Brookes University was engaged to undertake a ten-year study of the � 52 million being spent in about sixty British towns and cities. A sample of about one third of projects receiving HLF support are being <b>scrutinised.</b> The evaluation <b>methodology</b> is outlined, along with explanations of some challenges faced in such a large programme. The four mechanisms for gathering research data are explained, the origin and rationale for the sixteen indicators being employed are described, and the approach to overall evaluation outlined. Finally there is {{an overview of the}} baseline stage of the work, highlighting key issues from a research perspective, and briefly reflecting on findings to date. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{strategic}} report {{is the latest}} iteration of non-financial reporting in the UK. This project empirically analyses the practical implications and relevance of {{the production of a}} {{strategic report}} for shareholders and especially other stakeholders (e. g. employees, customers, suppliers, environmental agencies, social, community, and human rights bodies). The strategic reports of the FTSE 100 companies from 2015 and 2016 are <b>scrutinised,</b> using a <b>methodology</b> involving compliance coding. This study is especially significant as the practical implications and relevance of the production of a strategic report by company directors have not been discussed in depth in prior literature. This paper fills this gap by first providing empirical evidence on compliance with the relevant statutory provisions. It sheds light on the manner in which companies consider environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues in decision-making {{and the extent to which}} disclosure represents an effective strategy for engaging stakeholders in that process. It also evaluates the type and quality of information transferred from the company to stakeholders in the form of the strategic report. This first systematic review of strategic reporting in the UK carries international implications due to the high international shareholder base in FTSE 100 companies...|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates Jerzy Grotowski's {{influence}} on British theatre from a historical point of view. It examines {{a series of}} telling case studies between 1966 and 1980 which represent instances of both direct and indirect connections with the Teatr Laboratorium, and which exemplify how Grotowski's practice/ideas have been adapted, borrowed, misunderstood, and used as a catalyst by different British theatre artists. These case studies include: Peter Brook's production of US with the Royal Shakespeare Company, the work of 'fringe' groups Freehold and Triple Action Theatre, {{and a number of}} individuals who participated in paratheatrical activities (Anna Furse, [ennifer Kumiega, etc.). In order to better assess the UK's relationship with Grotowski, this thesis also analyses the British response to his company's performances in 1968 and 1969, as well as discussing Towards a Poor Theatre as the primary channel for the dissemination of his ideas. This thesis concludes by proposing an alternative way of mapping Grotowski's influence, not in a linear or hierarchical manner, but using a model which foregrounds diversity and simultaneity. In doing so it emphasises the multiplicity of Grotowski's legacies and embraces the complex processes by which they have spread. The connections between Grotowski and the UK and the British relationship to his practice have not previously been <b>scrutinised.</b> Therefore the <b>methodology</b> adopted by the thesis is based on archival research, field work, and extensive interviews with key individuals.

40|$|The {{early stages}} of {{engineering}} design are formidable terrain for human designers {{as well as their}} methodologies and tools. The large uncertainties, fluidity of concept, and frequent lack of quantitative relationships and data make the formal design methods difficult to apply. This project sought to develop a methodology that could help manage the process. The literature on the processes and methodologies engineering design were investigated, and interpreted with respect to a proposed generic design process. Existing methodologies are generally unsuitable for early design stages as they require relatively complete information and problem definition, which may be unavailable. There is need for methodologies that can support the designer even though the design uncertainties are high. A methodology called Design for System Integrity (DSI) was developed to support the management of uncertainty at the {{early stages of}} design. Essential features of this methodology are the ability to simulate system behaviour (i. e. functional modelling) based on quantitative as well as qualitative information, the accommodation of uncertainty of analysis and process variability, and the provision of multiple viewpoints on the design, including but not limited to performance, cost, and reliability. The methodology is computationally demanding, and requires a supportive interface between the user and the algorithms, so it was necessary to embody it in software. The software development was from the ground up using the Delphi programming language rather than an expert system or database shell. The software development was a critical enabling mechanism in transforming the DSI methodology from a philosophy and design principle into an embodiment that could be explored and <b>scrutinised.</b> The <b>methodology</b> was applied to a case study of dishwasher engineering design. One of the viewpoints in this model was wash performance, and the system was able to successfully simulate this parameter in a probabilistic manner despite the uncertainties. Other views including electric shock hazard, reliability and cost were also simulated. Being able to produce not only an outcome but also measure its likelihood, is valuable information for evaluating and managing the integrity of a design. The DSI methodology may be applied in the early designs stages when uncertainty is high, {{as well as in the}} more mature stages. In addition a catalogue system was developed for functional modelling. This permits the designer to select a device from a database, and inherit the default properties of that device. Importantly, the functional modelling may occur over several viewpoints simultaneously, and placing a device into one view will cause the system to automatically create and populate additional viewpoints in the background with other properties of that device. It is also possible to substitute one device for another, corresponding to the testing of various candidates, and the properties of the device are changed to those of the new one. The results demonstrate that it is possible to develop a methodology for modelling qualitative and quantitative performance at early design stages, so as to manage the integrity of a design...|$|R
