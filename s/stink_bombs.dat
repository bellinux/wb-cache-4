5000|$|Comments on <b>Stink</b> <b>Bomb</b> and Cannon Fodder {{were less}} favorable. T.H.E.M Anime {{reviewer}} Carlos Ross stated that [...] "the other two entries don't quite equal the sheer excellence of ‘Magnetic Rose’. McPherson referred to <b>Stink</b> <b>Bomb</b> by saying [...] "compared {{to the other}} episodes of Memories, it's the weakest and less creative of the bunch", while Anime Jump’s Chad Clayton thought Cannon Fodder did not [...] "match {{the complexity of the}} preceding two films." [...] <b>Stink</b> <b>Bomb</b> was nonetheless praised for its humor and high quality visuals. Cannon Fodder was viewed as [...] "the strongest work in terms of its allegorical message" [...] by DVD Talk, and visually [...] "inventive" [...] by both Anime Jump and Anime Academy. Tasha Robinson at SciFi.com described the animation of every episode as [...] "stellar", claiming the film as a whole went [...] "well beyond memorable".|$|R
25|$|Betar {{has been}} at the {{forefront}} of Jewish activism in Australia. Betar Australia began protesting Nazi supporters and sympathizers in 1952, when it released pigeons and <b>stink</b> <b>bombs</b> during a concert by allegedly pro-Nazi German pianist Walter Gieseking in Melbourne. The group battled neo-Nazi groups in the 1960s, and in the 1970s and 1980s, it spearheaded the protests of the Sydney Jewish community on behalf of Soviet Jewry. The group was instrumental in supporting the annual protest outside the Soviet Consulate in Trelawney Street, Woollahra, which occurred each Pesach, and has supported mass protests outside the Bolshoi Ballet and the Moscow Circus on Ice at the Sydney Entertainment Centre. It also protested Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze's visit to Canberra and Sydney. In the 1970s, the group demonstrated against a visit of the General Union of Palestine Students to the Australian Union of Students after the latter had moved to the political left. In later years, Betar Australia took the initiative to organize community protests outside the Iraqi Embassy in Canberra during the Gulf War and outside the Iranian Embassy to protest Iranian state sponsorship of terrorism. The group also marched in front of the German Consulate in Sydney to protest what it perceived to be a resurgence of anti-Semitism in postwar Germany. In 2004, Betar Sydney was active in protesting Dr. Hanan Ashrawi's receiving of the Sydney Premier's peace prize.|$|E

The Daily Chronicle reported: [...] "The rest of Miss Lind-af-Hageby's indignation was lost in a beautiful 'eggy' atmosphere that was now rolling heavily across the hall. 'Change your socks!' shouted one of the students." [...] Furniture was smashed and clothing torn.|$|E
500|$|The atomic {{bombings of}} Hiroshima and Nagasaki are {{identified}} {{as the cause of}} Japanese whaling. The two Japanese cities were destroyed by atomic weapons during the final stages of World War II under orders by U.S. President Harry Truman, which killed about 220,000 people. In [...] "Whale Whores", the Japanese are presented with a doctored picture of the Enola Gay, the B-29 Superfortress bomber that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. The picture shows a dolphin and a whale piloting the plane to bomb the city. The Miami Dolphins, a National Football League professional football team, are killed along with real dolphins by the whalers in [...] "Whale Whores". Near the end of the episode, Stan and the crew of the MY Steve Irwin encounter fishing ship captain Sig Hansen and his crew from the Discovery Channel reality series, Deadliest Catch. The scene with Paul Watson's crew throwing [...] "stinky butter" [...] at the whalers refers to Watson and his crew's practice of throwing <b>stink</b> <b>bombs</b> containing butyric acid, an acid found in rancid butter and cheese, at Japanese whaling vessels, including the factory vessel, the Nisshin Maru.|$|E

500|$|When Sørli came to Stockholm in January 1944 he {{took over}} for Gjems-Onstad, while Gjems-Onstad was {{to take over the}} {{leadership}} of Lark as well as to reorganise Milorg. Gjems-Onstad also founded the propaganda organisation Durham when he came back to Trondheim in March 1944. Lark and Durham were to be kept completely separate, with Gjems-Onstad as their only mutual connection. Durham's mission was to influence the moral of the enemy, mainly through distributing brochures (an estimated 115,000 copies in total) and posters (an estimated 257,000), while also to cause irritation by minor sabotage. The brochures were chiefly distributed in the enemy's quarters, and the posters were put up throughout Trondheim. Members of the group also tore down Nazi posters, sabotaged German vehicles, threw <b>stink</b> <b>bombs</b> into restaurants and cinemas, and applied itching powder—notably in condoms for sale to German soldiers. Sabotage on a bigger scale had to be authorised from London, and was largely discouraged as it would risk unnecessary German reprisals. Gjems-Onstad reported back in Stockholm at the end of June. Eager to bring supplies to Trondheim, he and Sørli soon decided to transport propaganda material, handguns and explosives to the Norwegian border. After finding a lost resistance member in the mountains, Gjems-Onstad joined a course in Alby near Stockholm where he worked as instructor in [...] "silent killing" [...] for a month. He went for a short mission to Trondheim in July in order to insert Egil Løkse as Lark's new radio operator there.|$|E

2500|$|According to NME critic Dan Martin, {{other critics}} {{might have found}} Idlewild to be [...] "a bit long and uneven and self-indulgent". In a {{negative}} review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Jim DeRogatis viewed the album as unfocused and stated, [...] "it's all about heavy-handed, faux Scott Joplin ragtime piano; showy but lame Cab Calloway horn arrangements; fake Rudy Vallee crooning (courtesy of Benjamin's nasal, off-key whine) and ultra-hammy vaudeville shucking and jiving". The Washington Posts J. Freedom du Lac noted a [...] "creative schism" [...] in the duo and wrote, [...] "For all of its flashes of greatness -- the brassy marching-band rap of 'Morris Brown', the psychedelic hip-hop flashback 'Train', the Stevie Wonder-inspired acoustic blues number 'Idlewild Blue (Don'tchu Worry 'Bout Me)' -- the staggeringly eclectic 'Idlewild' includes too much filler and too many outright <b>stink</b> <b>bombs</b> to deserve a place alongside the best pop offerings of 2006, let alone Aquemini, et al". Preston Jones from Slant Magazine called it [...] "frustrating, uneven, and strained ... an interesting failure". Spin magazine's Charles Aaron called it [...] "a perplexing album", despite how it [...] "grasps for a distinctive sound, departing almost entirely from rap per se" [...] in favor of music from [...] "the jazz/jump blues from the film's '30s/40's demimonde, as well as shades of Prince's most fitfully eclectic periods".|$|E
50|$|On April 20, 2007, former Ponderosa student Caleb Pegues, as a prank, {{set off a}} <b>stink</b> <b>bomb</b> in an area {{frequented by}} {{students}} who allegedly smoked marijuana in the area. The date (4/20) holds some significance to many people, {{as well as being}} the anniversary of the Columbine massacre. The <b>stink</b> <b>bomb</b> consisted of a combination of various household chemicals. Reports indicated that either a toilet bowl cleaner or ammonia was put in a plastic bottle along with a piece of tin foil. This reaction created a gas, causing the plastic bottle to expand until it burst. The gas created by such a mixture reportedly smells like rotten eggs.|$|R

5000|$|At {{the lower}} end of the spectrum, {{relatively}} harmless <b>stink</b> <b>bombs</b> consist of ammonium sulfide, which smells strongly of rotten eggs. When exposed to air, the ammonium sulfide reacts with moisture, hydrolyzes, and a mixture of hydrogen sulfide (rotten egg smell) and ammonia is released. Other popular substances on which to base <b>stink</b> <b>bombs</b> are thiols with lower molecular weight, e.g., methyl mercaptan and ethyl mercaptan—the chemicals that give odor to skunks and are added in minute quantities to natural gas in order to make gas leaks detectable by smell.
