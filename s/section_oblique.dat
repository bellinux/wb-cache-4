40|$|A new {{approach}} to improve {{the performance of a}} butterfly gyroscope is developed. The methodology provides a simple way to improve the gyroscope’s sensitivity and stability, by reducing the resonant frequency mismatch between the drive and sense modes. This method was verified by simulations and theoretical analysis. The size of the hexagonal <b>section</b> <b>oblique</b> beam is the major factor that influences the resonant frequency mismatch. A prototype, which has the appropriately sized oblique beam, was fabricated using precise, time-controlled multilayer pre-buried masks. The performance of this prototype was compared with a non-tuned gyroscope. The scale factor of the prototype reaches 30. 13 mV/ ˚/s, which is 15 times larger than that obtained from the non-tuned gyroscope. The bias stability of the prototype is 0. 8 ˚/h, which is better than the 5. 2 ˚/h of the non-tuned devices...|$|E
40|$|The Tortonian biocalcarenitic {{succession}} in Amantea Basin was {{deposited in}} a ramp setting of a peri-Tyrrhenian shelf embayment, whose northern part was {{linked with the}} southern part by a tectonic graben {{referred to as the}} Monte Pellegrino strait. The graben was 1. 5 – 2 km wide and 4 km long, had shallowly submerged margins and a south-sloping sublittoral floor dominated by strong, asymmetrical tidal currents. The water depth fluctuated due to episodes of rapid subsidence driven by extensional tectonics. The strait-fill biocalcarenites are up to 120 m thick and consist of planar cross-stratified beds that range in thickness from b 0. 2 m to N 20 m and represent 2 -D dunes accumulated as a mounded longitudinal complex. Bed thicknesses have been measured in four vertical logs along an outcrop <b>section</b> <b>oblique</b> to the palaeostrait. The stratigraphic pattern of bed-thickness variation has been analyzed by using two versions of the runs test, the Moore–Wallis test, the median-crossing test, the mean squared successive difference test, the Hurst statistic, the Spearman rank-correlation test and the Meacham rank-difference test. The statistical tests indicate that the axial zone and inner flank of the tidal complex show alternating clusters, 5 – 15 m thick, of thinner and thicker beds, whereas the outer flank and marginal zone show thinning-upward bed packages, 15 – 25 m thick. An overall thinning-upward trend characterizes the transitional flank zone. The bed packages are considered to form aggradational parasequences, whose varied lateral development is attributed to a differential response of the subtidal system to bathymetric changes. The data set indicates that the bed thicknesses are self-similar, but beds thinner than 250 cm have a different fractal dimension than the thicker beds. The pattern of bed-thickness variation {{is considered to be a}} result of internal forcing of a sedimentary system in a state of self-organized criticality, perturbed by bathymetric changes. Fractal property bears important implications for the spatial characteristics of sedimentary succession, allowing bed geometries and volumes to be assessed on the basis of thickness data from isolated logs or drilling cores...|$|E

LaPrade et al. [106] demonstrated that the sensitivity of a 1.5 -T MRI scanner for diagnosis of a PLC lesion is 66.7 – 100 % and specificity is 66.7 – 100 %, depending on the anatomical structures.

Several papers [12, 105, 106] suggest that MRI diagnosis of a PCL lesion is difficult, even with the most advanced technologies. We believe that stress radiographs are mandatory in evaluation of an unstable knee but do not help the clinician to identify the injured structures. MRI does not solve this problem, because it cannot fully visualize posterolateral structures in at least 50 % of patients [105]. This is still a problem in PLC lesion diagnosis.|$|R

This article presents a spine needle biopsy simulator, based on visual and force feedback, which can be used to plan the optimal path of a needle and to practice the procedure without risk. Materials and Methods: The simulator is composed of a 3 D human model, a visual-feedback component, a force-feedback component, and an evaluation module. The human model is based on 3 D CT data. The visual-feedback component provides an <b>oblique</b> <b>section,</b> multiplanar reformatting images, and a volume-rendered image.

40|$|Abstract: Constructing {{balanced}} sections across inverted basins {{is difficult}} because of the different directions of tectonic transport during extension and compression and the imprecise estimates of the magnitude and timing of inversion events. Sections oriented within 25 ~ of all transport directions can be restored and result in < 10 % error {{in the amount of}} extension-compression. Extensional faults are commonly oblique to the transport direction, so the inferred extension direction may be verified by dip analysis of the pre-rift <b>section.</b> Where <b>oblique</b> extensional faults are reactivated uring compression, the compressional vector is best determined from the orientation and magnitude of large, curved inversion a ticlines.

The holes, joints and/or slots are permeable and are diagonally introduced to the surface. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The method for adhering components from same or different metals in the automotive-, aircraft- and engineering- and related industries, comprises coating adhesive surfaces of the components to be joined with an adhesive for actual adhesion process, introducing conical holes, joints and/or slots in the adhesion surfaces by a neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser after coating, filling the holes, joints and/or slots with fast-hardening adhesives and then hardening. The holes, joints and/or slots are permeable, are diagonally introduced to the surface during tensile stress of the adhered components, and have changing directions. Contour sections act as the holes, joints and/or slots, where slots are S-shaped with <b>oblique</b> <b>sections.</b> <b>Oblique</b> boring and oblique cutting edge are implemented {{for the production of}} holes, joints and/or slots after trepanning process. Cyanacrylate and/or low-viscous 2 -K-epoxide resin and/or ultraviolet activated- or ultraviolet hard adhesive system are used as fast hardening adhesives. The holes, joints and/or slots are introduced into the join parts and then the adhesion surfaces are coated with the adhesive that penetrates into the join parts. The adhesive is temporarily heated and then flows into the holes, joints and/or slots. The temperature lies under the hardening temperature. Hot-melts are used as adhesive, are heated up to melting and flow into the holes. The heating and cooling of the adhesive in the holes, joints and/or slots take place before hardening the adhesive surfaces. The low-melting metals are introduced into the holes, joints and/or slots. The hardening of the adhesive surfaces is integrated into a continuous overall process. The hardening of the adhesive surfaces takes place in the cathodic immersion lacquer process during the application in the automobile industry. The already hardened adhesive is displaced with specified adhered rivet. The strengthening takes place by filling materials. The adhesives are strengthened in the holes, joints and slots to increase their firmness. The fiber strengthening of the adhesive takes place by carbon fibers, glass fibers and or textile fibers. Carbon-nanotubes and/or particles in micro- or nano-size are used as the filling materials. USE - Method for adhering components from same or different metals useful in the automotive-, aircraft- and engineering- and related industries.

Regional mapping and Pb/U zircon geochronology reveal structural continuity through this crustal section for volcanic, plutonic and metamorphic assemblages developed at ~ 100 Ma, {{making it one}} of the youngest sections in the world.

The synthetic cross-section depicts the state of the sialic crustal section during its ~ 100 Ma petrogenesis. Critical features of the section are as follows: (1) Much of the pre-Cretaceous crust was completely reconstituted by batholith generation; (2) Major influxes of mantle-derived tonalitic to gabbroic magmas drove crustal-level melting and magma mixing; (3) Pre-existing sialic components within the batholithic magmas were contributed primarily from partial to complete melts of craton derived metasedimentary material; (4) Silicic magmas emplaced at shallow crustal levels represent moderately to well-mixed and fractionated systems, while those frozen at deeper levels appear to be more heterogeneous both lithologically and geochemically; (5) Granulite facies metamorphic assemblages in the deep crustal rocks developed primarily in a retrograde regime descending from gabbro and tonalite solidus conditions; (6) Upward rise of silicic magmas was accompanied by downward return flow of metamorphic host rocks, and locally ignimbrite sections of only slightly older age than enclosing plutons were transported to considerable depth as well; (7) Much of the upper crust responded to the intrusion of silicic magmas by large-scale extension which also promoted major ignimbrite eruptions; and (8) Within the deeper levels of the composite batholith and off its flanks, at moderate to shallow crustal levels, low-angle detachments may have developed as a primary structural feature.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{upper part}} of the Almond Formation records the overall retreat of a wave-dominated {{shoreline}} and associated lagoons or bays. Exposures of these strata on the eastern flank of the Rock Springs Uplift, Wyoming, U. S. A., enable analysis of their stratigraphic architectures along <b>sections</b> oriented <b>oblique</b> to depositional strike. The upper Almond Formation comprises at least nine vertically stacked regressive–transgressive cycles. The regressive component of each cycle consists of thick (up to 22 m), laterally continuous wave-dominated shoreface and overlying coastal-plain deposits that occur in paleoseaward locations and have abrupt (, 400 m) paleolandward pinchouts. The transgressive component of each cycle consists of one or more bay-fill successions that occur in paleolandward locations and gradually thin in a paleoseaward direction. Transgressive bay-fill deposits in each cycle are thick (up to 18 m) and associated with preservation of surfaces that record, in progressively paleoseaward locations: initiation of a lagoon or bay (transgressive surface), erosional retreat of tidal-inlet channels (tidal ravinement surface) and the shoreface (wave ravinement surface), and marine flooding (marine flooding surface). This architecture records regression of a strandplain or wave-dominated delta, and subsequent transgression of a barrier island and spit with associated lagoon or bay. The occurrence of such thick and fully preserved bay-fill successions indicates that accretionary transgressive shoreline trajectories were developed. Strongly-aggradational-to-weakly-retrogradational stacking of successive regressive–transgressive cycles results in a layered stratigraphic architecture, with laterally continuous shoreface sandstone layers interbedded with bay-fill shale layers.

The obtained value of refractive index n(0) at the center axis almost agreed with the value obtained by the interference method. As the application of this mode analyzer, the measurement of group-delay differences of modes and amplitude distribution of modes in a long fiber, and the measurement of the constants of fiber are considered...|$|R
40|$|When {{the fine}} {{structure}} of the mitochondrion was first described (1, 2), Palade commented that the internal membranes of adrenocortical mitochondria were arranged as filaments and not as cristae. Such membranous filaments appear oval in <b>oblique</b> <b>section,</b> sausage-shaped in longitudinal section, and near-circular in cross-section (Figs. 1 and 3). In this connection the terms "folds " and "villi " should only be used with caution with the adrenal cortex since seldom can it unequivocally be shown that an inner lamina of the mitochondrial enclosing membrane does, in fact, fold inwards villus-fashion. There is considerable diversity in {{the appearance of the}} mitochondrial internal membranes at various cortical levels. In the zona glomerulosa these membranes are frequently seen as long filaments in parallel alignment while in the outer fasciculata (Fig. 1) the filaments are shorter and more irregularly disposed. In the inner zona fasciculata and the zona reticularis a predominance of circular cross-sectional outlines suggests that mitochondrial internal membranes there are saccular or vesicular rather than filamentous in shape (Fig. 2). These observations...|$|R
