40|$|Within EU {{marketing}} <b>authorization</b> <b>procedures</b> {{of human}} and veterinary medicinal products (HMP and VMP), an environmental risk assessment (ERA) has to be performed. In the event that an unacceptable environmental risk is identified, risk mitigation measures (RMM) shall be applied {{in order to reduce}} environmental exposure to the pharmaceutical. Within the <b>authorization</b> <b>procedures</b> of HMP, no RMM have been applied so far, except for specific precautions for the disposal of the unused medicinal product or waste materials. For VMP, a limited number of RMM do exist. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop consistent and efficient RMM. Therefore, existing RMM were compiled from a summary of product characteristics of authorized pharmaceuticals, and new RMM were developed and evaluated. Based on the results, appropriate RMM were applied within the <b>authorization</b> <b>procedures</b> of medicinal products. For HMP, except for the existing precautions for disposal, no further reasonable measures could be developed. For VMP, two specific precautions for disposal and 17 specific precautions for use in animals were proposed as RMM...|$|R

40|$|A {{programmable}} authorization {{mechanism for}} an engineering document database is described. The database stores documents and their versions {{in a commercial}} relational database. Documents and other objects contain user-defined attributes.

The system consists of centralized server and client programs, which communicate with the server using a specific protocol. The database administrator {{must be able to}} formulate rules that tell who is allowed to do particular database operations; rules that tell which operations are allowed in particular document states; and rules that describe consistency invariants between attributes.

40|$|Abstract—Problems in {{organizational}} authorization result in productivity impacts and in security risks, for example, from over-entitlements and non-compliance. Many {{of the problems}} originate from organizational dynamics in combination with problematic <b>authorization</b> <b>procedures</b> for permission changes. To mitigate these problems and to improve the processes or craft supporting tools, a solid understanding of the processes and interactions between stakeholders is required. However, little prior empirical research covers <b>authorization</b> <b>procedures.</b> This paper presents an exploratory study of the procedures {{in organizational}} contexts. To enable a systematic analysis, an authorization process model is introduced {{that focuses on the}} interrelation of stakeholders and activities. The study discusses process characteristics, including the degree of centralization and the formality of interactions. Beyond this study, the model should serve as a basis for further research and support process designers to identify potentials of improvements.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{memorandum}} is to reiterate the high priority OSW places on RCRA Subtitle C State authorization by providing guidance that will enhance {{the use of the}} streamlined <b>authorization</b> <b>procedure</b> promulgated in the HWIR-media final rule (November 30, 1998, 63 FR 65874). I consider the promulgation and implementation of this new procedure to be a major component of our efforts to speed the authorization of States for the RCRA program. This new <b>procedure</b> <b>simplifies</b> State <b>authorization</b> applications for minor or routine rules by not requiring a revision to a State’s Attorney General’s statement, Program Description, and Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with EPA. The procedure also shortens the authorization process by setting a deadline of 60 days from receipt of a complete application for EPA to publish a Federal Register notice on its authorization decision. This new procedure can be used for rules that are listed in Table 1 to 40 CFR 271. 21. We will continue to add new rules to this table as they are published. As discussed in the preamble to the HWIR-media rule, the existing authorization regulations provide EPA with the flexibility to determine what specific documents must be included in a State’s authorization application (see 40 CFR 271. 21 (b)). EPA also has the programmatic discretion to commit to specific time frames for the review of a State’s application, depending on factors such as th...|$|R

In this case, the rationality of political decision making should be more comprehensive than scientific risk assessment.|$|R

30|$|The {{argument}} is still quite clear and plausible if a layperson’s perspective interested in issues {{of justice and}} in values of a good life confronts the rationality of administrative, formalized procedures for evaluating risk. In a study of <b>authorization</b> <b>procedures</b> with citizen involvement that concerned the release of genetically modified organisms, Bora and Hausendorf have shown how these formalized legal procedures systematically exclude core concerns of laypeople. The value-oriented arguments of citizens do not fit into the procedure’s scheme designed to process factual issues of scientific risk evaluation. The narrow definition of “technological citizenship”—as something whose content is related to scientific issues of truth—that the procedure prescribes is forced through, systematically disappointing the understanding of technological citizenship held by the participating citizens as extended civil rights in technology policy.|$|R
