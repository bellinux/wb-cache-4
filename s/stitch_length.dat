In apparel industry both garment manufacturers and thread suppliers predict thread consumption per unit <b>length</b> of <b>stitch</b> for their thread purchasing and logistics processes. Inaccurate thread consumption predictions lead to inaccurate costing and reduction of warehouse utilization for both garment manufacturers and sewing thread manufacturers. Purchase of excess or shortage quantities of thread cones make suppliers to endure those excess or shortage thread quantities, so that both parties undergo inflexible logistic process (Jaouadi et al. 2006). In this context sewing thread manufacturers and garment manufacturers are looking for accurate method predicting sewing thread consumption for given <b>stitch</b> <b>lengths</b> so that wastages could be minimized.|$|R

Future aircrafts engines {{are expected to be}} more efficient with lower operation costs and without compromising safety. Concerning the complex requirements for fan systems or fan containments, composite materials are able to fully avail their high potential with regard to a significant weight reduction and an increased efficiency by using their high specific strength and stiffness. However, the insufficient delamination behaviour of 2 D-reinforced composites is often opposed to a broad application in impact resistant lightweight structures. In this respect, through thickness reinforcements, e. g. by stitching, are expected to be a very promising way to optimise 2 D textile reinforced materials. An experimental investigation approach for 3 D reinforced materials under impact loading conditions is presented in this article, which includes the description of the testing procedure as well as the tested material configurations and the experimental results. The focus of the experimental investigation was set on the examination of damage due to delamination failure depending on various stitching configurations using a multi-layered weft knitted fabrics (MKF). Concerning the implementation of the 3 D-reinforcement by stitching with the double locked stitch technology, two different stitching thread materials, glass and aramid, were used.

[...] The size of the new stitch is determined {{in large part by}} the diameter of the knitting needle used to form it, because that affects the length of the yarn-loop drawn through the previous stitch. [...] Thus, large stitches can be made with large needles, whereas fine knitting requires fine needles.

40|$|In {{this article}} the {{influence}} of the friction forces on <b>stitch</b> <b>length</b> is analysed. In the course of research, fabrics with different mechanical and structural properties have been used. Internal friction of fabric has been assessed using resonant oscillations. When correlating <b>stitch</b> <b>length</b> with internal friction of fabric it has been established that internal friction influences the <b>stitch</b> <b>length.</b> With minor internal friction of fabric <b>stitch</b> <b>length</b> is unstable and may vary by up to 0. 5 mm. As internal friction of fabric increases, average <b>stitch</b> <b>length</b> stabilises or varies within the limits of 0. 1 mm. In order to assess quality of the sewing garment it is important to establish how deformation of the sewing garment changes both in the course of sewing and when some time passes after sewing. This is the internal friction that determines relaxation time of the sewing garment {{and at the same time}} variation of <b>stitch</b> <b>length</b> after sewing. With minor internal friction of fabric relaxation time of the sewing garment is short (~ 10 min). When fabrics with higher internal friction are sewn together relaxation time is longer (up to 60 – 240 hours). It has been established that different external forces lead to different feeding conditions of fabric. If external friction force is minor <b>stitch</b> <b>length</b> has no tendency of constant variation, i. e. it may either increase or decrease within the limits of 0. 1 mm – 0. 3 mm.

This paper concerns with the theoretical research of fabric load and external friction forces that have influence on change in <b>stitch</b> <b>length</b> along the seam.

The carried out calculations illustrate that at a low ratio between the fabric mass and load mass, influence of the ratio between the friction coefficients of the sewing garment and load on change in length is different: when the ratio between friction coefficients is below 1, increase of the mass ratio leads to higher change in stitch length; when the ratio of friction coefficients is above 1, increase of the mass ratio leads to lower change in stitch length; when the mass ratio fluctuates within greater limits, a tendency of <b>stitch</b> <b>length</b> change variation is not subject to the friction ratio, and change increases in all cases.

40|$|The term sashiko {{refers to}} the {{stitching}} {{of one or more}} layers of cloth with a simple running stitch and can also apply to the completed fabric. Sashiko is the noun of the verb sasu, meaning to pierce. Sashiko probably was initially a way to recycle or extend the life of cloth. Among the textiles in the Shoso-in, the Imperial Repository built circa 752 to preserve thousands of objects of art and other belongings of the Emperor Shomu, is an 8 th Century 2 ̆ 2 distant mountain 2 ̆ 2 pattern monk 2 ̆ 7 s robe covered with a purple silk running stitch. This running stitch is superfluous to the actual structure of the robe. This is a development of an earlier ritual robe, evolved {{to the point where the}} stitches have lost their original function to strengthen and attach the patches of cloth, but retained to give the appearance of the original 2 ̆ 2 robe of rags. 2 ̆ 2 This is the oldest example of sashiko extant in Japan. There is a gap in recorded history from this point until the 17 th Century when other sashiko are mentioned. Sashiko was done throughout Japan, primarily by women. It is not known to have been done commercially with the possible exception of some of the firemen clothing. Often it was done by and for people who were too poor to buy new cloth. Sashiko developed from necessity rather than as a luxury, so the art of sashiko wasn 2 ̆ 7 t highly competitive, with some exceptions. That is, the product was not regarded as a statement of fashion. Originally a practical technique for making cloth thicker, warmer, and more durable, sashiko can also be purely decorative. Clothing that has been over stitched is not only very strong, but warm. Therefore, it was reasonable to reinforce the cloth by stitching before the cloth wore out. Presently it is done on new cloth, for garments and textiles to be sold in folk craft shops. Typically, sashiko stitching is done with white cotton thread on an indigo-dyed fabric. Most sashiko uses one strand of thread through the needle, doubled so that both strands account for the stitch although it can be done with a single strand. The <b>length</b> of the <b>stitch</b> varies with the number of layers being stitched together. Keeping the <b>stitches</b> even in <b>length,</b> as well as straight, requires skill and practise. There are approximately five to ten stitches per inch (five to ten stitches per 2. 5 cm.) with certain districts noted for having particularly fine stitching. Sashiko was done on balanced weave textiles, that is the warp and weft are the same thickness and weight of thread. Although the ground fabric threads were not usually counted, the stitches were. Within a pattern, per line, the same number and <b>length</b> of <b>stitch</b> is held constant and is consistent (from point A to B are always x number of <b>stitches</b> and the <b>length</b> of each <b>stitch</b> is held constant). Many patterns consist of straight lines that intersect at right angles, so counting the stitches made the patterns quite exact. At the point of intersection either the stitching threads cross creating a pattern, or the absence of the threads create a pattern such as a star or the center of a flower. Sashiko can be either a single repeating pattern or a combination of several patterns on one fabric...|$|R
40|$|Textile {{process and}} textile {{structures}} that {{are suitable for}} composites are carefully studied and chosen to have weft knitted fabrics. The aim {{of this research is}} to knit the carbon and Dyneema® fibres in circular weft knitting to fit contour shapes. Carbon/Dyneema® can also be knitted in warp knitting machines to get properties in multi axial direction. But the fabric was flat and can be used only for 2 D shape products which are having less drapabiity. According to previous research, weft knitting is the best suitable for complex preforms. Before knitting these fibres properties were studied {{in order to avoid the}} damage to the carbon fibres. The carbon fibres have high bending rigidity, low resistance to friction and are very brittle. A small damage to the carbon fibre in knitting subsequently affect directly on the composite properties. The strongest manmade fibre manufactured till date is Dyneema® and these fibres could be used in composites due to its performance, properties and light weight. But, the Dyneema® fibres are expensive when compared to common polyester, so polyester fibres are used to compare the properties and cost performance ratio. The critical bending of the carbon fibres causes friction between the fibres and also between fibre and machine. This was considered carefully during the knitting of carbon fibres and the idea chosen is mentioned in this thesis. Between the two layers of Dyneema®/polyester, carbon fibres are laid circularly in unidirectional and in un-crimped condition. This makes the carbon yarn to possess good mechanical properties. The 2 layers of Dyneema®/polyester fibres exchange the loops at certain points to increase the inter-laminar strength and decrease the carbon fibre distortion. This structure helps to withstand external load. It is also lighter than the carbon composite with additional properties. This makes much more space in the future for the Dyneema® fibres in the 3 D carbon composite manufacturing. The internal carbon fibres are fully covered by the Dyneema® fibres to withstand the external impact load and not to damage the carbon fibres. So the loop <b>length,</b> <b>stitch</b> density, fibre volume fractions are considered before knitting...|$|R
