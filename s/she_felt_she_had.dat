Dunderdale ran against Liberal cabinet minister Oliver Langdon, and while she knew she would not win the election <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to send premier Clyde Wells a message about the way he was treating municipalities. In the 1995 Progressive Conservative leadership election Dunderdale served as co-chair of Lynn Verge's successful campaign.|$|E

25|$|Sackville-West was {{a writer}} and author of novels. The Edwardians (1930) and All Passion Spent (1931) are perhaps her best-known novels today. In the latter, the elderly Lady Slane courageously embraces a long {{suppressed}} sense of freedom and whimsy {{after a lifetime of}} convention. This novel was dramatised by the BBC in 1986 starring Dame Wendy Hiller. All Passion Spent appears to reflect Woolf's influence, as Lady Slane, who has only existed while married to her late husband, a former prime minister, finally begins to live after his death, and becomes friends with the servants on her estate, discovering that the lives of people she had ignored until then are also interesting. At the end of the novel, Lady Slane persuades her granddaughter to break off an arranged marriage to pursue her career as a musician. Sackville-West took up writing again in 1930 after a six-year break {{for a variety of reasons}} as she needed money to pay for the Sissinghurst Castle which had just been purchased; Nicolson having left the Foreign Office no longer had a diplomat's salary to draw upon; she had to pay tuition for her two sons to attend Eton, one of the most expensive public schools in England; and it because <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> become a better writer thanks to the mentorship of Woolf who had taught her how to write better.|$|E
25|$|By her own account, Casco {{began working}} with women's groups around 1946, mainly because she {{had the support of}} her brother Adolfo. While as a woman she had no real {{political}} power, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been less marginalized than others. Initially, women helped each other with social service needs, but in 1953, she and other professional women founded the Intituto Cultural de Amparo a la Mujer (Cultural Institute of Refuge for Women). Made up primarily of teachers, with a few doctors and lawyers, their objective was to counsel women and assist them in overcoming societal impediments, such as poor pay, discrimination, poverty, lack of health care, though at times they provided material support. They also attempted to refer women to other benevolent associations that {{might be able to help}} them. In 1954, a coup d'etat brought the dictator Alfredo Stroessner to power and within two years, he issued a decree banning the Institute and placing the women who organized it on lists of suspicious persons. The group did not disband, but instead transformed into the Women's Department of the Liberal Party, though in fact, the Liberal Party was still an illegal organization, as the one-party state was limited to the Colorado Party. Women were not allowed to run for office or participate in any decision-making process. Instead they performed benevolent works, visiting prisoners, raising money, hosting meetings and providing food for functions.|$|E
25|$|Several weeks later, Kathy {{has escaped}} Gavin, and she {{contacts}} her old friend Tracey (Jane Slaughter), at The Queen Vic, giving her {{an address to}} pass on to Phil. Gavin follows Phil to a small hotel. He reaches Kathy first and takes her to a small airfield, with the intent of flying away from England. Phil and Ronnie intercept them and convince Kathy to come back to Walford with them. While Phil arranges a hotel for her to stay in, she hides in The Arches, where she comes face to face with Sharon, who is stunned to find she is alive. They have an angry confrontation which leads to a physical fight, before Phil moves Kathy to a nearby hotel. Within a week, Kathy is revealed to have Gavin hidden in her bathroom, with him controlling her again. After Ian's wife Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) talks him out of suicide, Ian is shocked to see Kathy is alive and has witnessed the event. As Ian crosses the road to meet Kathy, he is hit by an oncoming car and rushed to hospital. Ian eventually regains consciousness and breaks down in happiness when he realises that Kathy is alive, but reveals he wants answers for her faking her death. As Ian is leaving hospital, Jane threatens Kathy to stay away from Walford in a bid to protect Ian. Ian demands to see Kathy and she explains to him that Gavin forced her to go on the run with him as part of an insurance scam and he had controlled her for years and <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> no choice. Ian persuades her to go to the police and she agrees, however, she lies about why she is there when she enters the station by claiming her handbag is stolen and later tells Ian that she told them everything and they are looking for Gavin. She then secretly meets Gavin who reminds her of their plan.|$|E

After she believed she had accomplished that, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> freedom to make the type of music she [...] "really love". Furtado said her previous problem with hip hop was that she did not think it was good enough to base one of her albums on, but that she then asked herself why she was being [...] "pretentious".|$|E
500|$|Barlow {{decided to}} leave Hollyoaks in early 2011, as <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> given all she could to the role. This {{prompted}} the producers to devise a memorable exit storyline for Rae. Barlow was informed of their plans in March 2011, but her exit, and details of the storyline, were concealed from viewers. Speculation arose that Rae would become the next victim of serial killer Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle); Barlow tried to discredit these rumours, and denied that she was leaving Hollyoaks as she wanted viewers to be [...] "surprised and shocked" [...] by her exit.|$|E
500|$|Zaini-Lajoubert opines {{that the}} story {{promotes}} a treatment of women as persons with feelings and opinions, {{as opposed to the}} patriarchial view common during the period that women were unfeeling objects. She finds {{that the story}}'s female characters feel grief and joy, quoting several passages, including one where Siti Akbari confesses that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> waited [...] "dozens of years" [...] for Abdul Moelan. Zaini-Lajoubert notes that the female characters are not all of the same opinion: although Siti Akbari was willing to enter a polygamous relationship, Siti Bida Undara had to be coaxed. Ultimately, however, she finds that Siti Akbari conveys the message that women should be faithful and obedient to their husbands.|$|E

500|$|Paramount {{changed the}} way that {{individual}} episodes were funded, with overspending on some episode budgets allowed on the proviso {{that it would be}} recouped by a reduction in others.

The role of Lt. Ilia was rewritten in the story to become a part for Marina Sirtis as Counselor Deanna Troi. Sirtis praised this development, as <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been overlooked during the first season due to the presence of both McFadden and Denise Crosby.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} {{to the success of}} the , Paramount Television increased the budget per episode for , but also changed the financing structure so that funds could be carried over from episode to episode. But due to the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike, the work on the [...] was delayed and the length of it overall was reduced. The producers sought to go into production immediately upon the strike being lifted, so they studied the story ideas put forward as part of Phase II. [...] "The Child" [...] was held up as one possibility, with the position of Ilia in the story changed to become Troi. Sirtis praised this development, as <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been overlooked during the first season due to the presence of both Gates McFadden and Denise Crosby.|$|E
500|$|Hepburn {{stuck to}} her {{decision}} not to remarry, and made a conscious choice not to have children. She believed that motherhood should be a full-time commitment, {{and said it was}} not one she was willing to make. [...] "I would have been a terrible mother," [...] she told Berg, [...] "because I'm basically a very selfish human being." [...] <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> partially experienced parenthood through her much younger siblings, which fulfilled any need to have children of her own. Rumors have existed since the 1930s that Hepburn may have been a lesbian or bisexual, which she often joked about. In 2007, William J. Mann released a biography of the actress in which he argued this was the case. In response to this speculation about her aunt, Katharine Houghton said, [...] "I've never discovered any evidence whatsoever that she was a lesbian." [...] However, in a 2017 documentary, columnist Liz Smith, who was a close friend, attested to the fact that she was.|$|E

After Ziskin's death Field expressed her gratitude at being a part of both Ziskin's first and last films. Director Webb felt that [...] "when you cast someone like Sally, they come with a certain level of awareness and real genuine affection, which for Aunt May is an incredibly important thing to have."

500|$|Since her death, McClintock {{has been}} the subject of a {{biography}} by the science historian Nathaniel C. Comfort's The Tangled Field: Barbara McClintock's Search for the Patterns of Genetic Control. Comfort's biography contests some claims about McClintock, described as the [...] "McClintock Myth", which he claims was perpetuated by the earlier biography by Keller. Keller's thesis was that McClintock was long ignored or met with derision because she was a woman working in the sciences. For example, when McClintock presented her findings that the genetics of maize did not conform to Mendelian distributions, geneticist Sewall Wright expressed the belief that she did not understand the underlying mathematics of her work, a belief he had expressed towards other women at the time. In addition, geneticist Lotte Auerbach recounted that Joshua Lederberg returned from a visit to McClintock's lab with the remark: 'By God, that woman is either crazy or a genius.' [...] " [...] As Auerbach tells it, McClintock had thrown Lederberg and his colleagues out after half an hour 'because of their arrogance. She was intolerant of arrogance... <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> crossed a desert alone and no one had followed her.'" ...|$|E
500|$|At an {{industry}} showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift {{caught the attention}} of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form his own independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had met Borchetta in 2004. She {{became one of the first}} signings, and her father purchased a three percent stake in the fledgling company at an estimated cost of $120,000. The singer began working on her eponymous debut album shortly after signing the record deal. She persuaded Big Machine to hire her demo producer Nathan Chapman, with whom <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> the right [...] "chemistry". Swift wrote three of the album's songs alone, and co-wrote the remaining eight with writers Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia. Taylor Swift was released on October 24, 2006. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times described it as [...] "a small masterpiece of pop-minded country, both wide-eyed and cynical, held together by Ms. Swift's firm, pleading voice". Taylor Swift peaked at number five on the Billboard 200 and spent 157 weeks on the chart, marking the longest stay by any release in the 2000s. As of August 2016 the album has sold over 7.75 million copies worldwide.|$|E

500|$|... "You're Not Sorry" [...] {{was written}} by Swift and {{produced}} by Nathan Chapman alongside Swift.

[...] As the relationship continued, Swift was informed of numerous secrets about her boyfriend she was not aware of. [...] "And one by one, I would figure them out.

500|$|In {{the late}} winter of 1867, Stowe {{followed}} {{her son to}} Florida, finding that the warmer weather allowed her {{to spend more time}} on two novels she was writing. Her first weeks in Orange Park utterly transformed her and she became enchanted with Florida at once, writing that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> sprouted wings and become [...] "young & frisky". She accompanied her son one day to collect the mail, which was deposited in Mandarin, about [...] across the St. Johns River.

Stowe's transformation in Florida was rooted in her identification and familiarity with Puritan New England: industry and thrift in a climate where cold sharpened one's senses and values. The laid-back attitude of the people and warmth of the Southern climate were seductive. She at first attempted to persuade her brother Charles to purchase the land in Mandarin, writing to him and asking [...] "How do you think New England theology would have fared had been landed here instead of Plymouth Rock?" [...] She wrote about the land and climate intoxicating her and pondered the effect it might have had on literature when she posed an idea to her publisher: [...] "I hate to leave my calm isle of Patmos—where the world is not and I have such quiet long hours for writing.
