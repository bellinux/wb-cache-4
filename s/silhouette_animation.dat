25|$|Anime {{follows the}} typical {{production}} of animation, including storyboarding, voice acting, character design, and cel production (Shirobako, itself a series, highlights {{many of the}} aspects involved in anime production). Since the 1990s, animators have increasingly used computer animation to improve {{the efficiency of the}} production process. Artists like Noburō Ōfuji pioneered the earliest anime works, which were experimental and consisted of images drawn on blackboards, stop motion animation of paper cutouts, and <b>silhouette</b> <b>animation.</b> Cel animation grew in popularity until it came to dominate the medium. In the 21st century, the use of other animation techniques is mostly limited to independent short films, including the stop motion puppet animation work produced by Tadahito Mochinaga, Kihachirō Kawamoto and Tomoyasu Murata. Computers were integrated into the animation process in the 1990s, with works such as Ghost in the Shell and Princess Mononoke mixing cel animation with computer-generated images. Fuji Film, a major cel production company, announced it would stop cel production, producing an industry panic to procure cel imports and hastening the switch to digital processes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Earth Intruders" [...] was {{directed}} by Michel Ocelot. It features Björk's face floating in the background, first upside down, then upright, singing with her eyes closed. In the foreground, {{a large group of}} silhouetted tribal warriors dance in time to the music. The video features psychedelic colours and patterns imposed on an earthy backdrop. The video ends with Björk's face slowly fading into the middle of a glade, her eyes being opened just as she sings the last lyric. Ocelot stated that Björk had originally wanted Kirikou to be featured as a 20-year-old in the video. It was accomplished within strict time constraints through a combination of live-action, <b>silhouette</b> <b>animation,</b> 3D computer graphics, traditional animation, cut-outs and other special effects. [...] "Kirikou" [...] was danced by Legrand Bemba-Debert in a costume made, based on Ocelot's ideas, by paper sculptor Anne-Lise Kœhler. The full video was made available in the iTunes Store on April 24, 2007. It was nominated for the 2007 Q Award for Best Video.|$|E

The so-called Animagica program, originally performed at the Branchage Film Festival in Jersey, has now been performed at Latitude, Sydney Festival, Mona Foma in Tasmania, St. Leonard’s Church London, Perth International Art Festival, National Museum of Singapore and Reykavik‘s Children Festival. When performing the Animagica program amiina plays usually as a trio or a quartet.|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Marcus Nispel and {{the style of the}} video was a major trendsetter in the early 1990s. It featured <b>silhouetted</b> <b>animation</b> of dancers jumping and dancing in front of a white background, with a stage visible, but also in silhouette. The story of the song was also interpreted with black and gold cut-out animation that was a departure from the in-vogue 3D CGI animation of the time; however, these 2-D cut-outs ended up being even more progressive.|$|R

5|$|The French {{animator}} Émile Cohl {{produced a}} version of the stories using <b>silhouette</b> cutout <b>animation</b> in 1913; other animated versions were produced by Richard Felgenauer in Germany in 1920, and by Paul Peroff in the United States in 1929. Colonel Heeza Liar, the protagonist of the first animated cartoon series in cinema history, was created by John Randolph Bray in 1913 as an amalgamation of the Baron and Teddy Roosevelt. The Italian director Paolo Azzurri filmed The Adventures of Baron Munchausen in 1914, and the British director F. Martin Thornton made a short silent film featuring the Baron, The New Adventures of Baron Munchausen, the following year. In 1940, the Czech director Martin Frič filmed Baron Prášil, starring the comic actor Vlasta Burian as a 20th-century descendant of the Baron.|$|R
5000|$|Stemmle {{likened the}} game's episodic {{development}} to a relay race, {{and the development}} of a full game, such as Escape from Monkey Island, to a [...] "marathon". This production method meant that certain aspects, such as the game's graphics, were worked on until the release deadline. Each episode took around four months to complete. Only a few environmental resources were reused between episodes; while Telltale Games had built previous games such as Sam & Max Save the World and Wallace & Gromit's Grand Adventures around one set of locations, using the protagonists' homes and nearby streets consistently in each episode, the developers forwent such central hubs and [...] "comfort zones" [...] in Tales of Monkey Island, instead having each episode move off to a new primary location, only occasionally revisiting past locations. However, reusable skeletons and animations were developed for the supporting cast, including generic body types that could be visually altered to suit each character. While four of these were created, size constraints resulted in only two being included in the final game. By the game's third episode, Telltale became unsatisfied with this system, and began diversifying facial features, and providing supporting characters with unique <b>silhouettes</b> and <b>animations.</b>|$|R
5000|$|As {{with the}} song, {{the video is}} based on [...] "The Veldt" [...] by Ray Bradbury. It shows two {{children}} entering [...] "The Nursery", and running through a savannah landscape with lions and vultures eating bloody dead remains. They stop, and the boy begins to climb up a small mountain. He then suddenly finds his sister standing {{on the edge of}} a precipice. He then approaches her and after pushing her off the edge, jumps off. They slide down the ledge and meet at the ground. The video ends with the two children holding hands as a lion walks off in the distance, leaving behind broken glasses and a trail of blood, presumably of their parents. The video is dedicated to Ray Bradbury, who died weeks before the video was published. The video's art style, which makes heavy use of dark <b>silhouettes</b> and puppet-like <b>animation,</b> bears a strong resemblance to the independent video game Limbo.|$|R

5000|$|His œuvre is characterised {{by having}} {{worked in a}} variety of {{animation}} techniques, typically employing a different medium for each new project, but almost exclusively within the genres of fairy tales and fairytale fantasy. Some, such as Kirikou and the Sorceress, are loose adaptations of existing folk tales, others are original stories constructed from the [...] "building blocks" [...] of such tales. He describes the process as [...] "I play with balls that innumerable jugglers have already used for countless centuries. These balls, passed down from hand to hand, are not new. But today I'm the one doing the juggling." [...] Visually, they are characterised by a rigid use, excepting brief transitions between them, of the side-on, straight-on and ¾ viewpoints http://dvdrama.net/news.php?19910 of <b>silhouette</b> and cutout <b>animation</b> (such as that of Lotte Reiniger and Karel Zeman) even when working in mediums which allow for greater flexibility and dynamic viewpoints. Though often likened to Reiniger, he himself finds her films [...] "rather archaic and not very attractive" [...] and does not list them among his favourites. He also admires the art of ancient Egypt, pottery of ancient Greece, Hokusai and illustrators such as Arthur Rackham, W. Heath Robinson and his brothers and, most of all, Aubrey Beardsley. He was president of the Association international du film d'animation (ASIFA) from 1994 to 2000.|$|R
50|$|In the 1910s the German {{animator}} Lotte Reiniger pioneered <b>silhouette</b> <b>animation</b> as a format, whereby shadow-play-like puppets are filmed frame-by-frame. This {{technique has}} been kept alive by subsequent animators {{and is still}} practised today, though cel animation and computer animation has also been used to imitate the look of shadow play and <b>silhouette</b> <b>animation.</b> Traditional Chinese shadow puppetry was brought to audiences in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s {{through the efforts of}} Pauline Benton. Contemporary artists such as Annie Katsura Rollins have perpetuated the medium, sometimes combining the form with Western theatre.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Silhouette</b> <b>{{animation}}</b> is {{a variant}} of cutout animation in which the characters are backlit and only visible as silhouettes. Examples include The Adventures of Prince Achmed (Weimar Republic, 1926) and Princes et princesses (France, 2000).|$|E
50|$|However, traditional, cutout <b>silhouette</b> <b>animation</b> {{is still}} practised {{to this day}} by such people as Edward S. de Leon and Reza Ben Gajra, where it is often {{combined}} with other forms of stop motion animation such as Lumage.|$|E
50|$|By the Light of the Moon is a 1911 American single-reel silent film {{directed}} and filmed by Edwin S. Porter. It was produced for the Rex Motion Picture Company. It {{is one of}} the earliest examples of <b>silhouette</b> <b>animation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Traditional <b>silhouette</b> <b>animation</b> as {{invented by}} Reiniger is {{subdivision}} of cutout animation (itself {{one of the}} many forms of stop motion). It utilises figures cut out of paperboard, sometimes reinforced with thin metal sheets, and tied together at their joints with thread or wire (usually substituted by plastic or metal paper fasteners in contemporary productions) which are then moved frame-by-frame on an animation stand and filmed top-down with a rostrum camera - such techniques were used, albeit with stylistic changes, by such practitioners as Noburō Ōfuji in the 1940s and Bruno J. Böttge in the 1970s.http://ottawa.awn.com/archives/ottawa76.html Michel Ocelot's television series Ciné si (Cinema If, 1989) was a little different, combining cutouts and cels and also, more occasionally, live-action and clay animation (this series is better known as Princes et princesses, the feature film version mentioned below). This was also the first <b>silhouette</b> <b>animation</b> to successfully make characters appear to speak for themselves (traditionally, either intertitles or voice-over narration had been used) as the mixed medium made accurate lip syncing possible.http://www.heeza.fr/description.php?lang=2&path=64&sort=Article&page=0&id=296 Traditional animation {{can also be used to}} imitate <b>silhouette</b> <b>animation,</b> as seen regularly in Be-PaPas' Shōjo Kakumei Utena (Revolutionary Girl Utena, 1997).|$|E
50|$|<b>Silhouette</b> <b>{{animation}}</b> is animation {{in which}} the characters are only visible as black silhouettes. This is usually accomplished by backlighting articulated cardboard cut-outs, though other methods exist. It is partially inspired by, but {{for a number of}} reasons technically distinct from, shadow play.|$|E
50|$|More complex figures {{depicted}} in cutout animation, {{such as in}} <b>silhouette</b> <b>animation,</b> often have joints made with a rivet or pin or, when they are made on a computer, an anchor. These connections act as mechanical linkage, which {{have the effect of}} a specific, fixed motion.|$|E
5000|$|Their offbeat short films enjoy a small cult following, {{especially}} [...] "Mysterious Mose" [...] {{which was}} made in their garage in 1997-98, using a hand-wound bolex camera and an old 78rpm record as the soundtrack.

5000|$|Tales of the Night (French: [...] ) is a 1992 French <b>silhouette</b> <b>animation</b> {{television}} special {{written and}} directed by Michel Ocelot. It aired on Canal+ in France, ZDF in Germany and Channel 4 in the United Kingdom. It is a trilogy of three further fairy tales in much the same format as Ciné si.|$|E
50|$|The series, which Ocelot also voice acted in, co-produced, art {{directed}} and designed, {{returns to the}} format of short <b>silhouette</b> <b>animation</b> fairy tales established by 1989's Ciné si and continued in 1992's Tales of the Night to produce further stories originally conceived for the then-unsuccessful Ciné si, episodes of which have since enjoyed popularity {{in the form of}} the compilation movie Princes and Princesses.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} {{animation}} {{is as old}} as the film industry itself. Independent animators have produced innovative, often experimental, shorts since the silent era. One of the earliest feature-length animated films was The Adventures of Prince Achmed, made in 1926 by Lotte Reiniger, a German artist who made <b>silhouette</b> <b>animation</b> using intricate cut-out figures and back-lighting. She made another feature, Dr. Dolittle, in 1928.|$|E
50|$|Today, pure {{silhouette}} films made professionally are rare, {{and fewer}} still are animators who work primarily within its confines. However, sequences of digital and drawn <b>silhouette</b> <b>animation</b> can be seen, for example, in South Park {{when the lights}} are turned off, in an episode of Mona the Vampire (1999) and intermittently in the animation of Sayonara Zetsubō-Sensei (2007) {{and in a few}} levels in Donkey Kong Country Returns (2010).|$|E
50|$|Following {{the death}} of {{pioneering}} animator Noburō Ōfuji in 1961, Mainichi established a new award in his honour to recognise animation excellence. A specialist in <b>silhouette</b> <b>animation,</b> Ōfuji {{was one of the}} earliest Japanese animators to gain international recognition, winning accolades at the 1952 Cannes Film Festival and the 1956 Venice Film Festival. This award was first presented in 1962 for Tale of a Street Corner (Aru Machi Kado no Monogatari) by Osamu Tezuka.|$|E
50|$|Graveyard Jamboree with Mysterious Mose is a {{short film}} made in 1998 by film makers Seamus Walsh and Mark Caballero of Screen Novelties. The film {{utilizes}} puppetry, stop motion and <b>silhouette</b> <b>animation</b> {{to tell the story}} of an otherworldly creature preparing a celebration in a cemetery. Walsh and Caballero used the song Mysterious Mose recorded in 1930 by Harry Reser and his Radio All-star Novelty Orchestra. The film has gained world wide attention in film festivals and has retained a small cult audience.|$|E
50|$|Ocelot {{had many}} more ideas for stories in this format but {{the series was}} not as {{successful}} as he had expected and no further episodes than the initial eight were commissioned. A few years later, three of these stories were made into the TV special Les Contes de la nuit (Tales of the Night); in 2008 he returned to direct another ten of them as another television series, Bergères et dragons (Shepherdesses and Dragons), this time using computer animation to imitate the <b>silhouette</b> <b>animation</b> of Ciné si and Les Contes de la nuit.|$|E
5000|$|Charlotte [...] "Lotte" [...] Reiniger (2 June 1899 - 19 June 1981) was a German film {{director}} and the foremost pioneer of <b>silhouette</b> <b>animation.</b> Reiniger made more than 40 films over her career, all using her invention. Her best known films are The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926) - the oldest surviving feature-length animated film, preceding Walt Disney's feature-length Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) by over ten years - and Papageno (1935), featuring music by Mozart. Reiniger is also noted for devising a predecessor to the first multiplane camera.|$|E
