50|$|Petty {{officers}} serve a {{dual role}} as both technical experts and as leaders. Unlike the sailors who rank below them, {{there is no}} such thing as an undesignated petty officer. Every petty officer has both a rank and rating (job, similar to an MOS or AFSC in other branches). The rank and rating combined are known collectively as a sailor's rate. A petty officer's full title is a combination of the two. Thus, a petty officer third class who has the rating of Aviation <b>Structural</b> <b>Mechanic</b> is called an Aviation <b>Structural</b> <b>Mechanic</b> Third Class. The term petty officer is only used in abstract, the general sense, when referring to a group of petty officers of different ratings, or when the petty officer's rating is unknown.|$|R

2500|$|In January 1989 Robert Hood was {{appointed}} to lead McDonnell Douglas, replacing retiring Worsham. [...] McDonnell Douglas then introduced a major reorganization called the Total Quality Management System (TQMS).

This {{was replaced by a}} product-oriented system where they focus on one specific airplane. As part of reorganization, 5,000 managerial and supervisory positions were eliminated at Douglas. The former managers could apply for 2,800 newly created posts; the remaining 2,200 would lose their managerial responsibilities.
