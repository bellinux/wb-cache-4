5|$|Diefenbaker was the {{favourite}} {{throughout the}} leadership campaign. At the convention in Ottawa in December, {{he refused to}} abide by the custom of having a Quebecer be either the proposer or <b>seconder</b> of his candidacy, and instead selected an Easterner (from New Brunswick) and a Westerner to put his name in nomination. With most Quebec delegates backing his opponents, Diefenbaker felt that having a Quebecer as a nominator would not increase his support. Diefenbaker was elected on the first ballot, and a number of Quebec delegates walked out of the convention after his victory. Other Diefenbaker opponents, such as those who had urged Smith to run, believed that the 61-year-old Diefenbaker would be merely a caretaker, who would serve a few years and then step down in favour of a younger man, and that the upcoming election would be lost to the Liberals regardless of who led the Tories.|$|E
25|$|Wilson {{was elected}} to White's in 1889. Although White's {{membership}} books for the period do not survive, when his brother Jemmy {{was elected to}} Brooks's in 1894, his proposer and <b>seconder</b> were prominent members of the Anglo-Irish elite in London.|$|E
25|$|In the Scout Association, Sixes {{are led by}} a 'Sixer' {{and have}} a 'Seconder' as a backup. The Sixer wears two stripes on his/her uniform and the <b>Seconder</b> one stripe. When a Cub Scout is made a Sixer, the Second's badge (with one stripe) should be removed and {{replaced}} with the Sixer's badge. The members of a six are distinguished by the colour of the woggle they wear on their Group neckerchief (known elsewhere as a Group scarf).|$|E

25|$|In August 2011 this {{proposal}} was ruled {{out by the}} Western Regional Authority but the proposal continues to be discussed. During 2013 the idea twice failed to get a <b>seconder</b> at Galway and Mayo Co. Councils and was also defeated (16-3) at Roscommon Co Council. The Co Managers’ reports in respect of the new Co Development Plans for both Galway and Mayo pointed to the strategic importance of protecting the railway infrastructure and to having proposed walking and cycling routes located elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|The mood {{within the}} BCCI {{was one of}} gloom and doom as members fumed and fretted over the murky state of affairs that has made Indian cricket an object of global ridicule. Even though a {{majority}} of members wanted Srinivasan out and had the numbers to do so, they were rendered powerless by a technicality. The Tamil Nadu strongman had all but made sure he will be elected unopposed as his rivals didn't have a proposer and <b>seconder</b> from South Zone for their candidate. Under BCCI rules, a contender for the top post must have the endorsement {{of at least two}} units from the zone whose turn it is to elect the president.|$|E
25|$|On {{nomination}} day, {{the returning}} officer {{and his or}} her representatives will be present at designated nomination centres between 11:00am and 12:00 noon to receive prospective candidates' nomination papers, political donation certificates, and minority certificates (if required). Each nomination paper must contain a statement signed by the prospective candidate that he or she consents to the nomination; must include a statutory declaration by the prospective candidate {{that he or she is}} qualified to be elected; and must be signed by a proposer, a <b>seconder,</b> and four or more persons as assentors, each of whom must be a person on the register of electors for the electoral division in which the person seeks election.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes {{called the}} 'patrol method.' Scouts are {{organised}} {{in small groups}} (about five to seven Scouts) {{because this is the}} natural way boys work together. These patrols are therefore more important than the Scout troop. Patrols must be kept intact under all circumstances, including working, tenting, learning, cooking, and surviving together. In a Patrol the Scouts learn to work with others, while the Patrol leader learns responsibility for others. Both have to give up part of their personal interest for this. However, Scouting deals with the individual, not with the Company. A Scout has his own identity within the group and learns as an individual. The Patrol serves as the character school for the individual. Younger sections, such as Cub Scouts and Beaver Scouts, are divided into sixes (Cubs) or lodges (Beavers). While Beaver lodges have no leader structure, Cub sixes have a sixer and <b>seconder.</b>|$|E
500|$|To sound a {{theme of}} unity, Lincoln in 1864 ran {{under the banner of}} the National Union Party, rather than the Republicans. At the party's {{convention}} in Baltimore in June, Lincoln was easily nominated, although there had been some talk of replacing him with a Cabinet officer or one of the more successful generals. After the convention backed Lincoln, former Secretary of War Simon Cameron offered a resolution to nominate Hamlin, but it was defeated. Johnson was nominated for vice president by C.M. Allen of Indiana with an Iowa delegate as <b>seconder.</b> On the first ballot, Johnson led with 200 votes to 150 for Hamlin and 108 for Dickinson. On the second ballot, Kentucky switched to vote for Johnson, beginning a stampede. Johnson was named on the second ballot with 491 votes to Hamlin's 17 and eight for Dickinson; the nomination was made unanimous. Lincoln expressed pleasure at the result, [...] "Andy Johnson, I think, is a good man." [...] When word reached Nashville, a crowd assembled and the military governor obliged with a speech contending his selection as a Southerner meant that the rebel states had not actually left the Union.|$|E
2500|$|Nomination {{papers and}} {{certificates}} must be personally {{delivered to the}} returning officer in duplicate by the person seeking nomination. The person's proposer, <b>seconder</b> and at least four assentors must also be present in person. Each nomination paper is then posted outside the place of nomination; and candidates, their proposers, seconders, assentors and one other person appointed by each candidate to be present may examine the nomination papers of other candidates which have been received for that electoral division.

2500|$|The {{tradition}} of Cub Scouting in Hong Kong was {{inherited from the}} British. [...] It is the largest section of the Scout Movement in Hong Kong. A Pack is headed by a Cub Scout Leader (團長), with several Assistant Cub Scout Leaders (副團長) and Instructors (教練員). The division within a Pack is called a Six (小隊). [...] Each Six has a Sixer (隊長) and a <b>Seconder</b> (隊副 or 副隊長). [...] Each Six is distinguished by a colour and is named after it. [...] Each member of the Six wears a woggle with the colour of his Six. The Promise and Law for the Cub Scouts are simplified from those for Scouts. Traditionally, the logo of the Wolf Cub denotes the Cub Scouts, but it is rarely used.|$|E

60|$|The {{question}} {{having been}} launched, Spruce arose, a very neat speaker; {{a little too}} mechanical, but plausible. Endymion was astonished at the dexterous turns in his own favour which he gave {{to many of the}} statements of Hortensius, and how he mangled and massacred the <b>seconder,</b> who had made a mistake in a date.|$|E
60|$|One or two asked questions, {{which he}} {{answered}} candidly, {{and then there}} was a pause and somebody moved the adoption of the chairman's report and balance sheet.

She pushed back her veil, took out her handkerchief, put her hand on a chair in front, and gave the directors an apologetic smile.|$|E

6000|$|We owe great {{thanks to}} Mrs. Sturge for first {{surveying}} the place, to [...] ascertain {{the possibility of}} finding a mountain rock sufficiently [...] striking in position; to Mr. Richardson, jun., for his etching of the [...] rock, upon which the inscription is to be made; to his father for the [...] kind trouble he took in the measurement of the said rock; and [...] particularly to the <b>seconder</b> of the original proposal, and my [...] coadjutor in the task of final selection and superintending the work, [...] Mr. W.

60|$|Next, a tall, thin gentleman, {{in a very}} stiff white neckerchief, {{after being}} {{repeatedly}} desired by the crowd to 'send a boy home, to ask whether he hadn't left his voice under the pillow,' begged to nominate a fit and proper person to represent them in Parliament. And {{when he said it}} was Horatio Fizkin, Esquire, of Fizkin Lodge, near Eatanswill, the Fizkinites applauded, and the Slumkeyites groaned, so long, and so loudly, that both he and the <b>seconder</b> might have sung comic songs in lieu of speaking, without anybody's being a bit the wiser.|$|E
6000|$|Among {{the earlier}} {{speakers}} not one {{was inspired by}} a feeling of mercy for the audience. The chairman reveled in words. The mover and <b>seconder</b> of the first Resolution (not having so much as the ghost of an idea to trouble either of them), poured out language in flowing and overflowing streams, like water from a perpetual spring. The heat exhaled by the crowded audience was already becoming insufferable. Cries of [...] "Sit down!" [...] assailed the orator of the moment. The chairman was obliged to interfere. A man {{at the back of the}} hall roared out, [...] "Ventilation!" [...] and broke a window with his stick. He was rewarded with three rounds of cheers; and was ironically invited to mount the platform and take the chair.|$|E
50|$|By 26 April 2006, the {{opposition}} had {{indicated that they}} would contest {{at least half of the}} seats in the 84 member Parliament.

Candidates standing for election had only an hour to present their nomination papers and must be accompanied by their proposers, <b>seconders</b> and assentors. Observers projected that 37 People's Action Party candidates from seven Group Representative Constituencies would return unopposed and the PAP would be denied a majority on nomination day, an eventuality that proved to be true.|$|R

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{contentious}} issues facing the newly elected government was {{the decision of the}} province's capital city. The federal legislation creating the province had fixed Edmonton as the provisional capital, much to the chagrin of Calgary. Neither party had taken a position on the divisive question during the campaign, but selecting a permanent capital was {{high on the list of}} the new legislature's orders of business. Calgary's case was made most enthusiastically by Minister of Public Works Cushing, Edmonton's by Attorney-General Cross. Banff and Red Deer were also possibilities, but motions to select each failed to find <b>seconders.</b> In the end, Edmonton was designated by a vote of sixteen members—including Rutherford—to eight.|$|R
