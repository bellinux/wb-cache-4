Suspecting that Ray had a new lover, when Hackman saw her in the theatre with William Hanger, 3rd Baron Coleraine, he left, fetched two pistols, and waited in a nearby coffee house. After Ray and Galli came out of the theatre, Hackman approached the ladies just as they were about to get into their carriage. He put one pistol to Ray's forehead and shot her dead. With the other he then tried to kill himself but made only a flesh wound. He then beat himself with both discharged pistols until he was arrested and taken, with Martha Ray's body, into a tavern in St James's Street. Two letters were found on Hackman, one addressed to his brother-in-law, Frederick Booth, and a love letter to Martha Ray: both later appeared in evidence at the murder trial.|$|E
25|$|After the {{dispersal}} {{of the family}} of kings and queens, the aborigines became ungovernable, and constituted themselves into a serious threat to the survival of Ife. Thought to be supporters of Obatala who had ruled the land before the arrival of Oduduwa, these people turned themselves into marauders. They would come to town in costumes made of raffia with terrible and fearsome appearances, and burn down houses and loot the markets. It is at this point that Moremi Ajasoro, a princess of Offa, of the lineage of Olalomi Olofagangan, the founder of Offa-Ile and the paramount head of Ibolo region of old Oyo kingdom, of Ooduan dynasty by Oranmiyan, is said to have come onto the scene; she subsequently {{played a significant role in}} restoring normalcy back to the situation through a spying mission. She allowed herself to be captured and taken away with them. Subsequent to this she got married to the king of the Ugbo. Her new husband wanted pleasures from her but she wouldn't give in because she was married previously and was on a mission. She told him to tell her the secret of the marauders, he didn't want to but after a great deal of prodding, he gave in. He told her that the only thing they fear was FIRE, if they saw fire they would run. After this information she concocted an escape plan. She asked for some oranges and made the juice have a sleeping effect on the palace people. When they woke up after eating them, they found that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> tell her people. They were soon prepared for the marauders.|$|E
25|$|Within a {{month of}} Baldwin's arrival, Marie left Constantinople for Western Europe, {{assuming}} they followed the instructions of Blanche of Castille, Marie's great-aunt, who had arranged for her visit and had given Baldwin 20,000 livres in exchange for two promises: not to sell his properties at Namur, and to send Marie to visit her within a month after his return to Constantinople. Baldwin {{is said to have}} prepared four armed ships to take Marie and her escort abroad. Marie arrived in Cyprus while Louis IX and the Crusaders were there, only to have a strong wind blow her ship free of its anchor, taking it and all its cargo to Acre, leaving Marie with only the clothes on her back and a cloak. The Crusaders there took care of her. Presumably soon after leaving Cyprus, Marie arrived in Negropont 30 January 1249, from where she reached France in May. According to the Chronique de Flandres, Marie stayed with her great-aunt until Blanche died in 1252, after which, it reports, Marie went to live in her husband's estates at Namur. For the next years Marie contested unsuccessfully with Henry of Luxembourg for control of those properties—which were the source of income for both Emperor and Empress—until her cession of these lands and castles 17 June 1258 to Margaret of Flanders. Despite this, the Castle of Namur refused to surrender to Henry of Luxembourg, the vassal of Margaret of Flanders, until St. Vincent's Day (21 January 1259). After this <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> the court of Castile where she successfully raised the money to ransom her son Peter, who was held hostage by bankers in Venice and who was released at some date between June 1258 and 1 May 1261.|$|E

25|$|In {{her junior}} year, Krieger made 20 {{appearances}} for Penn State, ten of those appearances being in conference matches. She made seven {{goals in the}} season, which tied for second in the season at Penn State. Three of those goals were game winning goals. Penn State was the 2004 Big Ten Conference regular season champion and was No.1 seed in the Big Ten Women's Soccer Tournament. They {{made it to the}} quarterfinals of the tournament, when they were defeated by Michigan on November 3. Penn State earned the No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament, its highest seed ever. However, two days before the tournament, Krieger broke her leg while playing against a men's soccer team in preparation for the tournament. The injury required surgery, where they inserted a plate and five screws in her leg. A few months later in January, after traveling to visit her family, Krieger began experiencing shortness of breath and checked into the hospital as a precaution. As a result of her broken leg and subsequent plane rides, she had developed blood clots in her legs that traveled up to her lungs and caused a pulmonary embolism, affecting her blood flow and triggering multiple mini-heart attacks. The doctor informed her that if <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> sleep that night, there as a high probability that she would not have woken up. She was required to do a series of self-injections of enoxaparin for several months, but eventually made a full recovery and joined the Nittany Lions for her senior season. At the end of her shortened 2004 season, Krieger was given NSCAA All-America First Team honors, NSCAA All-Mid-Atlantic Region First Team honors, All-Big Ten First Team honors, and Academic All-Big Ten honors.|$|E

25|$|After a brief 1957 {{engagement}} to GMO vocalist Lorry Peters, Hambro met vocalist and beauty queen Lynn Michels in 1958, {{when he was}} 34 and she was 18. Michels, born Charlotte Joyce Wexler, was from Chester, Pennsylvania. She was on stage from an early age, working alongside a number of Pennsylvania-based acts, including The Four Aces and Bill Haley and the Comets. At age 10, she took first place during an appearance on Paul Whiteman's Philadelphia-based Saturday morning talent show, TV Teen Club (an indirect predecessor to American Bandstand). Later, she was a regular on the Sunday morning children's talent show, The Horn and Hardart Children's Hour, hosted by Stan Lee Broza on WCAU TV in Philadelphia and broadcast on WNBT TV in New York. While still in High School, Michels sang with the Al Raymond big band, playing the many ballrooms and lounges in the Tri-State area, as well as performing for weddings, ballroom dances, and senior proms at many Tri-State area high schools and colleges. However, the band's steady gig was Sunday nights at Upper Darby's St. Alice's Social Center. When she met Hambro in 1958, Michels was in her {{senior year of high}} school and singing with Al Raymond. She was introduced to Hambro by the manager of the El Rancho Club in Woodlyn, Pennsylvania, where <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> see Ray McKinley's Glenn Miller Orchestra. Hambro called her later that year to invite her to a GMO performance at a ballroom in Philadelphia. That evening, Hambro told her that he would pursue and marry her, but it was an extended and often long-distance courtship. When Michels graduated from high school, she went to work for the Matys Brothers, a rockabilly and later polka band from the Philadelphia area that was part of Bill Haley's stable. She would be with them until June 1960, touring the U.S. and Canada, while continuing to see Hambro when she could. Hambro and Michels were engaged July 23, 1960, after a GMO gig at the Brandywine Music Box and married on November5,1960, at The Wynne catering hall on North 54th Street in Philadelphia (Wynnefield), with Ray McKinley as their best man, and Ray's wife, Gretchen, looking on. They moved into an apartment at 159-15 83rd Avenue in Kew Gardens, Queens, New York. Son, Larry was born in the late summer of 1961, followed by brother Lee, in the winter of 1963.|$|E
