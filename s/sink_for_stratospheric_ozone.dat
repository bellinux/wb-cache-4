40|$|Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} greenhouse gases and a major <b>sink</b> <b>for</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone.</b> Estuaries are sites of intense biological production and N 2 O emissions. We aimed to identify hot spots of N 2 O production and potential pathways contributing to N 2 O concentrations in the surface water of the tidal Elbe estuary. During two research cruises in April and June 2015, surface water N 2 O concentrations were measured along the salinity gradient of the Elbe estuary by using a laser-based on-line analyzer coupled to an equilibrator. Based on these high-resolution N 2 O profiles, N 2 O saturations, and fluxes across the surface water/atmosphere interface were calculated. Additional measurements of DIN concentrations, oxygen concentration, and salinity were performed. Highest N 2 O concentrations were determined in the Hamburg port region reaching maximum values of 32. 3 nM in April 2015 and 52. 2 nM in June 2015. These results identify the Hamburg port region as a significant hot spot of N 2 O production, where linear correlations of AOU-N 2 Oxs indicate nitrification as an important contributor to N 2 O production in the freshwater part. However, in the region with lowest oxygen saturation, sediment denitrification obviously affected water column N 2 O saturation. The average N 2 O saturation over the entire estuary was 201 % (SD: ± 94 %), with an average estuarine N 2 O flux density of 48 ?mol m- 2 d- 1 and an overall emission of 0. 18 Gg N 2 O y- 1. In comparison to previous studies, our data indicate that N 2 O production pathways over the whole estuarine freshwater part have changed from predominant denitrification in the 1980 s toward significant production from nitrification in the present estuary. Despite a significant reduction in N 2 O saturation compared to the 1980 s, N 2 O concentrations nowadays remain on a high level, comparable to the mid- 90 s, although a steady decrease of DIN inputs occurred over the last decades. Hence, the Elbe estuary still remains an important source of N 2 O to the atmosphere...|$|E

5000|$|Since {{the time}} of Laplace (1799), {{scientists}} had been puzzled as to why pressure variations measured at the Earth's surface associated with the semi-diurnal solar tide dominate those of the diurnal tide in amplitude, when intuitively one would expect the diurnal (daily) passage of the sun to dominate.

By the second half of the twentieth century, however, observations had failed to confirm this hypothesis, and an alternative hypothesis was proposed that something must instead suppress the diurnal tide.

For example, the reaction of N 2 O 5 with ice surfaces gnerates HNO 3 which remains in the solid phase. Depending on temperature HNO 3 is transformed into NAT either in the alpha- or beta-form. The heterogeneous reaction of HBr with solid nitric acid yielded BrNO as one of the new reaction products...|$|R

(2006). A wide range of grades is obtained, both for different diagnostics applied to a single model and for the same diagnostic applied to different models, highlighting the wide range in ability of the CCMs to simulate key processes in the stratosphere. No model scores high or low on all tests, but differences {{in the performance of}} models can be seen, especially for transport processes where several models get low grades on multiple tests. The grades are used to assign relative weights to the CCM projections of 21 st century total ozone. However, only small differences are found between weighted and unweighted multi-model mean total ozone projections. This study raises several issues with the grading and weighting of CCMs that need further examination, but it does provide a framework that will enable quantification of model improvements and assignment of relative weights to the model projections...|$|R

Instituto de Astrofisica de Andalucia) science-oriented processor from high spectral resolution data (until March 2004) {{measured by the}} Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) aboard the environmental satellite Envisat. Bias determination and precision validation is performed {{on the basis of}} correlative measurements by ground-based lidars, Fourier transform infrared spectrometers, and microwave radiometers as well as balloon-borne ozonesondes, the balloon-borne version of MIPAS, and two satellite instruments (Halogen Occultation Experiment and Polar Ozone and Aerosol Measurement III). Percentage mean differences between MIPAS and the comparison instruments <b>for</b> <b>stratospheric</b> <b>ozone</b> are generally within ± 10 %. The precision in this altitude region is estimated at values between 5 and 10 % which gives an accuracy of 15 to 20 %. Below 18 km, the spread of the percentage mean differences is larger and the precision degrades to values of more than 20 % depending on altitude and latitude. The main reason for the degraded precision at low altitudes is attributed to undetected thin clouds which affect MIPAS retrievals, and to the influence of uncertainties in the water vapor concentration...|$|R
