This condition is very influenced by the selling price and the cost of fertilizer distribution. The use of distribution channels and pricing are very important, because it can affect the sales volume, the level of capital gains, risks, and the benefits. The general objective of each industry is certain to make a profit, and it will be achieved if the sales activities can be carried out successfully as planned. Cost element in the distribution of activity became an important thing because without the cost, the distribution will not running. This research will explain more about the influence of distribution channel cost on sales volume in Sarana Tani Manado that sell and provide the fertilizers, usually marketed in the field of agriculture in the region.
