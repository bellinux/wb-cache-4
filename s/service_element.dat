40|$|Background: Today’s {{healthcare}} organizations are challenged by pressures to meet growing population demands and enhance community health through improving service quality. Quality function deployment {{is one of}} the widely-used customerdriven approaches for health services development. In the current study, quality function deployment is used {{to improve the quality of}} chemotherapy unit services. Methods: First, we identified chemotherapy outpatient unit patients as chemotherapy unit customers. Then, the Delphi technique and component factor analysis with orthogonal rotation was employed to determine their expectations. Thereafter, data envelopment analysis was performed to specify user priorities. We determined the relationships between patients’ expectations and <b>service</b> <b>elements</b> through expert group consensus using the Delphi method and the relationships between <b>service</b> <b>elements</b> by Pearson correlation. Finally, simple and compound priorities of the <b>service</b> <b>elements</b> were derived by matrix calculation. Results: Chemotherapy unit patients had four main expectations: access, suitable hotel services, satisfactory and effective relationships, and clinical services. The chemotherapy unit has six key <b>service</b> <b>elements</b> of equipment, materials, human resources, physical space, basic facilities, and communication and training. There were four-level relationships between the patients’ expectations and <b>service</b> <b>elements,</b> with mostly significant correlations between <b>service</b> <b>elements.</b> According to the findings, the functional group of basic facilities was the most critical factor, followed by materials. Conclusion: The findings of the current study can be a general guideline as well as a scientific, structured framework for chemotherapy unit decision makers in order to improve chemotherapy unit services...|$|R
2500|$|The General Staff {{perceived}} {{its creation}} {{as a means}} of lessening Air Corps autonomy, not increasing it, however, and GHQ Air Force was a [...] "coordinate component" [...] equal to the Air Corps, not subject to its control. The organizations reported separately to the Chief of Staff, the Air Corps as the <b>service</b> <b>element</b> of the air arm, and GHQAF as the tactical element. However all GHQ Air Force's members, along with members of units stationed overseas and under the control of local ground commanders, remained part of the Air Corps. This dual status and division of authority hampered the development of Air Corps for the next six years, as it had the Air Service during World War I, and was not overcome until the necessity of expanding the force occurred with the onset of World War II. The commanding general of GHQ Air Force, Maj. Gen. Frank M. Andrews, clashed philosophically with Westover over the direction in which the air arm was heading, adding to the difficulties, with Andrews in favor of autonomy and Westover not only espousing subordination to the Army chain of command, but aggressively enforcing his prohibitions against any commentary opposed to current policy. Andrews, by virtue of being out from Westover's control, had picked up the mantle of the radical airmen, and Westover soon found himself on [...] "the wrong side of history" [...] as far as the future of the Air Corps was concerned.|$|E

40|$|A {{first step}} towards better {{efficiency}} of in-orbit systems {{is the introduction}} of serviceable platforms which, after retrieval and return to Earth, will be refurbished for a follow-on mission. Elements of a permanent orbital infrastructure, however, require in-orbit servicing to ascertain functioning during the entire scheduled operational phase. Moreover, there is an increasing demand for concepts which would alleviate astronaut activities by means of teleoperated or automated, i. e. unmanned, elements. As a general guideline, unmanned <b>servicing</b> <b>elements</b> in the primary phase of development should assume servicing tasks requiring outline manipulations, while EVA tasks requiring cognitive and strategic capabilities should be progressively assigned to unmanned <b>servicing</b> <b>elements.</b> It is the objective to derive technological requirements from the servicing scenarios of orbital infrastructure elements, in order to ascertain high operational efficiency of the infrastructure and payload systems during their entire lifetime by implementing unmanned servicing systems. This concept {{is based on a}} system engineering approach for the functional analysis of a reference concept for in-orbit servicing, in order to define the operational and technological requirements for a prospective <b>servicing</b> <b>element</b> {{on the basis of a}} contemporary model outlook w. r. t. potential technological solutions. To concentrate task definition of a prospective <b>servicing</b> <b>element</b> on evident application scenarios, the reference concept will be restrained to unmanned servicing in low earth orbit. Servicing tasks in other orbits, however, are assumed to be quite similar w. r. t. task definition and technology requirements. (orig.) SIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: D. Dt. F.

40|$|Emotions {{constitute}} a crucial element in understanding a service experience. When a service experience is evaluated by airport visitors, their evaluation {{is influenced by}} their emotional reactions. Furthermore, since emotions represent a primary source of human motivation, positive emotions are {{likely to lead to}} positive responses, increased satisfaction and favourable behaviour. These introductory statements give rise to the aim of this article, which is to explore those <b>service</b> <b>elements</b> influencing visitors‟ emotions and, consequently, also their experiences at an international airport. In order to achieve the aim, a questionnaire survey (N= 490) was conducted at an international airport in South Africa after which a factor analysis was performed to identify the primary elements of the airport service environment that influence the emotions of visitors. Structural equation modelling was then employed to test the significance {{of the relationship between the}} <b>service</b> <b>elements</b> and the emotions of visitors. Five distinct <b>service</b> <b>elements</b> were identified, namely Physical comfort, Amenities, Visitor facilities, Passenger services and Accessibility. These elements further showed significant correlations with the emotions of visitors. This research was the first of its kind conducted at an international airport in South Africa and contributes significantly to management practices regarding specific elements of an international airport environment, i. e. the emotions, experiences and behaviour of international airport visitors.

40|$|Service {{management}} {{involves the}} responsibility of ensuring the effectiveness of business operations in terms of meeting customer requirements. A good service is judged not only by meeting customer requirements {{but also by the}} way the customers perceive and interpret the received service. To know how effective the service is, the quality of the service can be measured. For this aim it is necessary to target actual <b>service</b> <b>elements</b> to improve and to weigh the evaluation of <b>service</b> <b>elements</b> relative to the importance that customers place on them. The literature shows that service quality outcome and measurement are dependent on the type of service setting, situation, needs and other factors. General instruments to measure perceived service were developed in the context of main dimensions proposed by general service quality models. However, it is important to develop new instruments which are directly targeted to the context reality. Based upon conceptual models the goal {{of this study is to}} target actual <b>service</b> <b>elements</b> that customers from an academic library in Costa Rica deem important. Using the identified elements the dimensions of service quality are developed and validated to measure user perceived service. It was discussed how appropriable knowledge on quality service can spurred the innovative capacity to improve library services...|$|R
