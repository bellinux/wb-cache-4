The bendy circuits {{could be used to}} make wearable medical sensors or 'smart ' surgical gloves, the researchers say. The circuits are composed of nanoribbons of single crystalline silicon. They're made using transfer printing techniques similar to those already used by the silicon industry, but modified to yield ultrathin circuit sheets with a total thickness of about 1. 5 micrometers- 50 times thinner than a human hair. These ultrathin circuit sheets are then bonded to a prestretched piece of rubber. Allowing the rubber to snap back to its original size makes the circuit <b>sheet</b> <b>buckle</b> like an accordion's bellows. These compressed circuits (see link to video below) can then be bent or stretched with no ill-effects. The circuits can be used to build transistors, amplifiers and logic gates with electrical performances as good as those on brittle semiconductor wafers. John Rogers of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who led the team, says the circuits could have many new applications for which conventional wafer-based systems are unsuitable.

Therefore, aluminum alloy sheets in sheet forming {{have been used in}} various areas as automotive components and so forth. During the process of sheet forming, wrinkling which is caused by compression stress might occur and the formability of sheets was affected by occurrence of wrinkling. A few studies of uniaxial compressive test by using square tubes, pipes and sheets were carried out to clarify the each wrinkling behavior. However, on uniaxial compressive test, deformation behavior of the sheets hasn’t be cleared. Then, it is necessary to clarify the relationship between the buckling behavior and the forming conditions.

This result is derived by means of ab initio calculations of the complex dielectric function for optical interband transitions applied to two-dimensional (2 D) crystals with honeycomb geometry. The assumption of chiral massless Dirac fermions is not necessary. The low-frequency absorbance {{does not depend on}} the group-IV atom, neither on the <b>sheet</b> <b>buckling</b> nor on the orbital hybridization. We explain these findings via an analytical derivation of the relationship between absorbance and fine-structure constant for 2 D Bloch electrons.

It consists in developing the unknowns (in plane stress components and out-of-plane displacement) in Fourier series and solving von Karman equations of thin strip buckling, in an energetic formulation. For application to cold rolling, certain simplifications are made and commented.

Measurement of {{hardening}} under reversed uniaxial loading is, {{because of}} its simplicity, very effective mechanical test to achieve several important features of material behavior. A special fixture {{which serves as a}} prevention of the <b>sheet</b> <b>buckling</b> during the cyclic tension-compression test is described in this paper. Result of the cyclic tension-compression test can consider several important features of the material behavior, which are necessary to be defined in the numerical simulation process. Experimental part of this paper consists of comparison results of strain path obtained from numerical simulation and real experiment. While a material model describing isotropic hardening was used in numerical simulation process, the real material behaved differently. Difference between strain paths also causes differences between results of springback values obtained in numerical simulation.

This manipulation involves grasping {{the sides of the}} sheet and utilizing the convex area resulting from bending the sheet. This sheet manipulation requires the development of a model of a bent sheet grasped with fingertips. We investigated the relationship between the grasping force and bending of the sheet and developed a bent sheet model. We also performed experiments on the sheet grasping stability with a focus on the resistible force, which is defined as the maximum external force at which a fingertip can maintain contact when applying an external force. The main findings and contributions are as follows. 1) After the <b>sheet</b> <b>buckles,</b> the grasping force only increases slightly even if the fingertip pressure is increased. 2) The range of the applicable grasping forces depends on the stiffness of the fingertips. Stiffer fingertips cannot provide a small grasping force but can resist large external forces.

A coupled rolling – buckling model has been developed [Abdelkhalek et al. 2011]. It has shown that (i) taking buckling into account results in completely different stress fields and fits correctly the measured on-line residual stresses under tension (“stress-meter rolls”); (ii) coupling buckling in the post-bite area and the rolling model, whatever the technique, changes little the in-bite fields.

It uses an implicit velocity formulation with P 1 -discretisation on hexahedra. A steady state formulation based on streamlines is used, which requires EVP constitutive equations integration along streamlines, with an heterogeneous time step strategy called ELDTH. The roll stack deformation model is based on advanced beam theory, Boussinesq solution of a half-space under general loading, and Hertz contact mechanics. This model is discretized by an influence function method, resulting in a system of equations in the roll rigid body displacement, contact line displacement field roll / roll and contact pressures.

Ill. (some col.) Steel sandwich panels with integrated structural and thermal insulating performance offer several advantages over conventional construction methods for residential roofs. These advantages include improved energy efficiency, reduced construction time, architectural benefits, and amenability to other energy-saving {{technologies such as}} integrated solar photovoltaic panels. Traditional foam core panels are unsuitable for roofs, however, because they rely on the core material (which has low stiffness and is subject to creep) for long-term structural performance. This work focuses on an alternative solution, web core panels, consisting of foam-filled panels with interior webs, with or without an additional insulating layer. The structural performance of web core panels {{is provided by the}} face sheets and webs. The core is used both as an insulating material and to strengthen the thin sheet metal components against local buckling failure. The webs, in particular, must be thin and widely-spaced to minimize their impact on thermal performance. As a result, they are subject to a variety of potential local failure modes that limit the range of feasible roof designs. The influence of the core material on local failure modes is examined in this work. Models are developed by treating the webs as plates on a Pasternak elastic foundation, with expressions for the foundation constants derived using energy methods. The models are validated through finite element analysis and prototype testing. The factors that limit the range of feasible web core designs are investigated. The limiting factors for design are thermal performance, panel deflection, face <b>sheet</b> <b>buckling,</b> and shear buckling of the webs. Thermal performance is particularly limiting due to the high thermal conductivity of the steel webs, and large panel depths are generally required. Panel depth can be reduced by using a web material with lower thermal conductivity, such as stainless steel, or by providing an external insulating layer. Design procedures are developed for panels with and without an external insulating layer and used to investigate the tradeoff between panel depth and weight. Based on minimum weight design, panels with stainless steel webs are recommended, especially as the applied load and R-value requirements increase...|$|R

The difference in stiffness between h-BN and GE results in unequal responses to external uniaxial and shear stress and different buckling transitions. In contrast to a GE <b>sheet,</b> the <b>buckling</b> transition of a h-BN sheet depends strongly on the direction of the applied compression. The molar heat capacity, thermal expansion coefficient and the Gruneisen parameter are estimated to be 25. 2 J mol− 1 K− 1, 7. 2 × 10 − 6 K− 1 and 0. 89, respectively. Fil: Singh, Sandeep Kumar.
