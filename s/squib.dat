5|$|The lawyers {{argued the}} case before the Appellate Division in Brooklyn on October 21, 1927. On December 9, the Appellate Division affirmed the trial court's judgment, 3–2. Albert H. F. Seeger wrote the {{majority}} opinion for the five justices hearing the case, and was joined by Justices William F. Hagarty and William B. Carswell. Seeger {{had been born in}} Stuttgart and came to the United States as a child; he had been elected to the Supreme Court in 1917 and was elevated to the Appellate Division by Governor Al Smith in 1926. Aged 68 at the time of Palsgraf, he could serve only two more years before mandatory retirement. Justice Seeger ruled that the finding of negligence by the jury was supported by the evidence, and speculated that the jury might have found that helping a passenger board a moving train was a negligent act. He wrote that while the set of facts might be novel, the case was no different in principle from well-known court decisions on causation, such as the <b>Squib</b> case, in which an explosive (a <b>squib)</b> was lit and thrown, then was hurled away repeatedly by people not wanting to be hurt until it exploded near the plaintiff, injuring him; his suit against the man who had set the <b>squib</b> in motion was upheld. The majority also focused on the high degree of duty of care that the LIRR owed to Palsgraf, one of its customers.|$|E
5|$|The rain did not hinder Bears' return man Devin Hester, who {{ran back}} the opening kickoff 92yards for a {{touchdown}} to give Chicago the then earliest lead in Super Bowl history, after only 14 seconds. The Colts avoided kicking to Hester {{for the rest of}} the game, allowing him only one punt return, and choosing to <b>squib</b> kick whenever Hester was in the deep kickoff return position.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Percival Graves {{approaches}} Mary Lou Barebone's adopted son Credence {{and offers}} to free {{him from his}} abusive mother. In exchange, Graves wants Credence to find an Obscurus, which he believes has caused the mysterious destructive incidents around the city. Credence finds a wand under his adopted sister Modesty's bed. Mary Lou assumes it is Credence's wand, but Modesty says it is hers. When {{she is about to}} be punished, the Obscurus attacks and kills Mary Lou and her eldest daughter Chastity. Graves arrives and after Credence leads him to the location of Modesty, dismisses him as being a <b>Squib</b> and refuses to teach him magic. Credence reveals he is the Obscurus's host, having lived longer than any other host due to the intensity of his magic. In a fit of rage, Credence transforms into an Obscurus and attacks the city.|$|E

5|$|On {{the ensuing}} kickoff, Egekeze {{attempted}} {{to kick the}} ball as it fell off the tee. This resulted in an unintentional <b>squib</b> that was returned 36yards to the Terps' nine-yard line. Nevada's Kaepernick attempted to rush but was stopped for no gain. On the next play, he threw {{the ball into the}} end zone, but it was intercepted by Maryland safety Kenny Tate, resulting in a touchback. The Terps started on their own 20-yard line, and running back Davin Meggett rushed for 13yards and a first down. Turner then linked up with freshman receiver Ronnie Tyler for another first down at the Maryland 49-yard line. After a false start penalty, the Terps were unable to gain a first down and punted the ball away. The ball rolled into the end zone for a touchback, and Nevada started the final drive of the quarter at its 20-yard line. Kaepernick then passed for two first downs, picked up another due to a pass interference call against Maryland, and scrambled for yet another. He then handed off to Taua, who rushed 17yards for a touchdown. Nevada re-took the lead, 14–13, with 46 seconds remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|The Bears {{fell behind}} early after Cordarrelle Patterson's 105-yard kickoff {{return for a}} touchdown. Devin Hester {{attempted}} to respond on the ensuing kickoff, but was pushed out of bounds at the Vikings' 32-yard line. The Bears fought back with a one-yard touchdown pass by Jay Cutler to Martellus Bennett, which Chicago added to with Cutler's touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall. In the second quarter, Jared Allen stripped the ball from Cutler, and Brian Robison returned the fumble 61 {{yards for a touchdown}} with 7:34 to go in the half. Afterwards, Hester returned the kickoff 80 yards to Minnesota's 23-yard line. The Bears offense later reached Minnesota's one-yard line, but Cutler had his pass intercepted by Kevin Williams in the end zone for a touchback. The Vikings failed to capitalize on the turnover after Tim Jennings intercepted Christian Ponder and scored on a 44-yard interception return. Minnesota retaliated with Ponder's 20-yard touchdown pass to Kyle Rudolph with 1:11 remaining, and the half ended with the Bears settling for a field goal. In the second half, the Vikings scored two field goals from Blair Walsh to take the 30–24 lead. However, the Bears scored on Cutler's 16-yard touchdown pass to Bennett, and ultimately prevailed after recovering a fumbled <b>squib</b> kick.|$|E
5|$|The Raiders won {{the coin}} toss and {{deferred}} {{in the second}} half. The Bears managed to record an 80-yard drive to score on the opening possession via Jay Cutler's seven-yard touchdown pass to Eddie Royal. During the drive, lineman Charles Leno landed on center Will Montgomery's leg, injuring the latter and prompting Matt Slauson to replace him. Robbie Gould's extra point was blocked, and his struggles continued with the following kickoff when his <b>squib</b> kick bounced out of bounds. After the game's four next drives culminated with punts, the Raiders scored on Carr's 26-yard touchdown pass to Cooper; despite initially being ruled out of bounds, the Raiders challenged the call and the ruling was overturned. On the Bears' next series, Slauson botched the snap to Cutler, and the Raiders' Dan Williams recovered. Oakland capitalized on the takeaway with Roy Helu scoring on a four-yard touchdown reception, though the Bears responded with Cutler taking advantage of an open Martellus Bennett to score on a five-yard touchdown. On Oakland's next drive, Carr's swing pass to Murray was deflected and landed towards Pernell McPhee, intercepting the pass; Gould eventually kicked a 19-yard field goal. In the second half, the Raiders punted on the first drive, though they reclaimed the ball after Stacy McGee recovered Matt Forte's fumble. Oakland eventually took the lead with Sebastian Janikowski's 29-yard field goal. Gould eventually gave the Bears the lead back with Gould's 54-yard kick, and reclaimed possession of the ball with Murray dropping a pitch and Sam Acho recovered. However, the Bears gave the ball back when Cutler's pass for Bennett fell short and was intercepted by Woodson, leading to Janikowski's 41-yard field goal.|$|E

50|$|<b>Squibs</b> {{are used}} in {{emergency}} mechanisms where gas pressure needs to be generated quickly in confined spaces, while not harming any surrounding persons or mechanical parts. In this form, <b>squibs</b> may be called gas generators. One such mechanism is the inflation of automobile air bags. In military aircraft, <b>squibs</b> are used to deploy countermeasures, and are also implemented during ejection to propel the canopy and ejection seat away from a crippled aircraft.

5|$|The game {{started with}} Maryland {{receiving}} the kick-off {{and on the}} first series, quarterback Chris Turner linked up with freshman Adrian Cannon for a 59-yard touchdown. However, placekicker Obi Egekeze missed the extra point. Nevada quarterback and Western Athletic Conference offensive player of the year, Colin Kaepernick, responded with a drive which included a 68-yard pass to the Maryland 3-yard line. The Terrapin defense stopped two rushing attempts by Vai Taua, but a short pass {{was good for the}} score, and with the extra point, Nevada took the lead 6–7. The Wolf Pack then kicked a 69-yard kick-off to Torrey Smith, who returned it 99yards for a second Maryland touchdown. Egekeze made good the extra point and Maryland regained the lead, 13–7. On the next kick-off, Egekeze attempted to kick the ball as it fell off the tee, resulting in a short <b>squib,</b> which was returned to the Terrapins' 9-yard line. Kaepernick threw into the endzone where it was intercepted by Maryland safety Kenny Tate for a touchback, but the Terrapins were soon forced to punt. Kaepernick advanced the ball downfield before a Taua 17-yard touchdown run. In the next series, Maryland sophomore Morgan Green rushed for threeyards and then a 53-yard touchdown breakaway. Later, Turner converted on third down with a 16-yard toss to Ronnie Tyler and threw again to Tyler for a 14-yard touchdown. Turner tallied a two-point conversion with a throw to Davin Meggett, and Maryland led at halftime 28–14.|$|E

Seattle decided to <b>squib</b> kick the ensuing kickoff to prevent a long return, but Bears tight end Gabe Reid gave Chicago good field position with a 20-yard return to the 43-yard line. After the two-minute warning, Grossman completed a 21-yard pass to Muhsin Muhammad and followed it up with an 18-yard completion to Rashied Davis, advancing the ball to the 7-yard line.
