The three-dimensional structure of a protein is required for a protein to be functional.

40|$|Leucine zippers are alpha helical {{monomers}} dimerized to a coiled coil structure. Various {{scenarios for}} dimerization span interaction of unstructured monomers that form alpha helices {{in the process}} of dimerization to preformed alpha helical monomers dimerizing. Another suggested possibility, a trigger <b>sequence</b> <b>hypothesis</b> (M. O. Steinmetz et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007, 104, 7062 - 7067), is that a C terminal (CT) part of each monomer is a trigger sequence that is dimerized and, subsequently, the remainder N terminal (NT) part of each monomer (that is partially ordered) zips together to form the coiled coil. In this work, methods are developed to computationally explore the trigger <b>sequence</b> <b>hypothesis</b> based on an extension of a previously introduced (R. I. Cukier, J. Chem. Phys. 2011, 134, 045104) Hamiltonian Temperature Replica Exchange Method Mean Square (HTREM_MS) procedure, which scales the Hamiltonian in both potential and kinetic energies, to enhance sampling generically, along with additional restraints to enhance sampling in desired regions of conformational space. The method is applied to a 31 -residue truncation of the 33 -residue leucine zipper (GCN 4 -p 1) of the yeast transcriptional activator GCN 4. Using a variety of HTREM_MS simulations, we find that the NT of one monomer of the dimer becomes disordered when the NT parts of the monomers are separated. In contrast, when the CT parts of the monomers are separated, both monomers remain alpha helical. These simulations suggest that the CT does act as a trigger sequence and are consistent with a disordered NT. We also investigate whether the disordered NT can be induced to re-form the dimerized leucine zipper. It does, but with some lack of recovery of alpha helical hydrogen bonding structure in the NT...|$|E

40|$|Individual life {{courses are}} dynamic {{and can be}} {{represented}} as a sequence of states for some portion of their experiences. More generally, study of such sequences {{has been made in}} many fields around social science; for example, sociology, linguistics, psychology, and the conceptualisation of subjects progressing through a sequence of states is common. However, many models and sets of data allow only for the treatment of aggregates or transitions, rather than interpreting whole sequences. The temporal aspect of the analysis is fundamental to any inference about the evolution of the subjects but assumptions about time are not normally made explicit. Moreover, without a clear idea of what sequences look like, it is impossible to determine when something is not seen whether it was not actually there. Some principles are proposed which link the ideas of <b>sequences,</b> <b>hypothesis,</b> analytical framework, categorisation and representation; each one being underpinned by the consideration of time. To make inferences about sequences, one needs to: understand what these <b>sequences</b> represent; the <b>hypothesis</b> and assumptions that can be derived about sequences; identify the categories within the sequences; and data representation at each stage.

40|$|The {{idea that}} {{development}} is the expression of information accumulated during evolution and that heredity is the transmission of this information is surprisingly hard to cash out in strict, scientific terms. This paper seeks to do so using the sense of information introduced by Francis Crick in his <b>sequence</b> <b>hypothesis</b> and central dogma of molecular biology. It focuses on Crick's idea of precise determination. This is analysed using an information-theoretic measure of causal specificity. This allows us to reconstruct some of Crick's claims about information in transcription and translation. Crick's approach to information has natural extensions to non-coding regions of DNA, to epigenetic marks, and to the genetic or environmental upstream causes of those epigenetic marks. Epigenetic information cannot be reduced to genetic information. The existence of biological information in epigenetic and exogenetic factors is relevant to evolution {{as well as to}} development...|$|E

The exactMWE criterion {{is similar to the}} Minimum Word Error (MWE) criterion but uses the exact word error instead of an approximation based on time alignments as used in the MWE criterion. It is shown that the exact word error for all word sequence hypotheses can be represented on a word lattice. This can be accomplished using transducer-based methods. The result is a word lattice of slightly refined topology. The accumulated weights of each path through such a lattice then represent the exact number of word errors for the corresponding word <b>sequence</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> Using this compressed representation of the word error of all word sequences represented in the original lattice, exactMWE can be performed using the same latticebased re-estimation process as for MWE training.

The question could be raised as to whether these children also progress through Piagetian stages of cognitive development more rapidly than their chronologi-cal age (CA) peers, perhaps at a rate predicted by the mental age (MA) calculated from their intelligence test scores (e. g., the 8 -year-old with a mental age of 12 should show formal operational abilities since 12 is the age often cited as the beginning of formal operations.)
