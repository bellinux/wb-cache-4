2500|$|Between 1976 and 1980, three {{prototype}} {{cars were}} built. The first immediately demonstrated {{a problem with}} the rubber-wheeled bogies. The linear induction motor required very accurate positioning about 15mm above its [...] "reaction rail" [...] in order to work efficiently and the slight give in the wheels was enough to make this a problem. The obvious solution to this would be to use steel wheels instead, but that would re-introduce the noise problem as the trains rounded curves in the tracks. A new solution was selected, using steel wheels with an articulated bogie that would steer each wheel into the direction of the track and thereby avoid the rubbing between the flange and track that caused the <b>screeching</b> <b>noise.</b> UTDC bought two modern articulated bogie patents from a private developer in the United States, which were further developed by Dofasco.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the valley}} along the Squamish River, {{there was a}} large two-headed serpent called Sínulhḵay̓ which terrorized the people, eating them and making a loud <b>screeching</b> <b>noise.</b> In the village of Stá7mes, a young man named Xwechtáal had {{recently}} become married and was enjoying the days after the big feast, when his father told him, [...] "You must go kill that serpent."

5000|$|Squeaking: It {{is done by}} {{inflating}} the balloon, {{then slowly}} release the air by stretching the neck or the mouth sideways. The stretched part creates a very tight and tiny gap for air to flow, then the air pressure causes the opening to oscillate and vibrate, creating a loud high-pitched squeaking or <b>screeching</b> <b>noise.</b> The sound can be changed by adjusting the tension of the stretching.

50|$|Early console {{games with}} {{streaming}} audio were on CD-based {{systems such as}} the PC Engine CD-ROM² System in 1988, and the CD-i and Mega CD in 1991. With their increased storage size over previous media such as cartridges, streaming audio and video could be added to games. These games typically used Mixed Mode CD audio, similar to audio CDs, except on a Mixed Mode CD, the data and audio coexist. Because of this, many early games with streaming audio can be played in any CD player, although the first track, which typically makes up the game itself, will either not play or result in an unpleasant <b>screeching</b> <b>noise</b> which can damage the listener's speakers.|$|E

5000|$|Braindead Soundmachine {{was founded}} in Los Angeles, California, United States, in 1989 as a joint effort between Coonce and speed metal record {{producer}} Croyle, as they conceptualized [...] "metaldisco," [...] a genre that melded Black Sabbath riffs topped by disco-y rhythm guitar and ethereal female vocals.

40|$|The {{near-field}} of the <b>screech</b> <b>noise</b> source {{structure of}} an under-expanded supersonic rectangular jet was studied in detail. A miniature probe microphone was used {{along with a}} reference microphone to determine the amplitude and phase of the sound pressure near and in the high speed flow field. The transverse structure of the unsteady pressure field was investigated by moving the probe microphone sufficiently far into the jet so that pressure fall-off was observed. Five islands of high sound pressure level have been distinguished which {{may be associated with}} the actual local sources of sound production. These sources of <b>screech</b> <b>noise</b> are closely associated with the jet shock structure as would be expected, with the peak region of noise level being found slightly downstream of each of the five observed shocks. The third and fourth noise sources have the highest levels and are about equal in strength. All of the apparent noise sources have their peak levels in the subsonic flow region. Strong cancellations in the acoustic field are observed in the downstream and sideline directions which may account for the predominant upstream propagation of the fundamental tone noise...|$|R
50|$|One way to {{understand}} the paradox of the wheel is to reject {{the assumption that the}} smaller wheel indeed traces out its circumference, without ensuring that it, too, rolls without slipping on a fixed surface. In fact, it is impossible for both wheels to perform such motion. Physically, if two joined concentric wheels with different radii were rolled along parallel lines then at least one would slip; if a system of cogs were used to prevent slippage then the wheels would jam. A modern approximation of such an experiment is often performed by car drivers who park too close to a curb. The car's outer tire rolls without slipping on the road surface while the inner hubcap both rolls and slips across the curb; the slipping is evidenced by a <b>screeching</b> <b>noise.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The P. mayeri live in dreys, or nests, “in the forks of trees, {{less than}} four meters off the ground.” These nests consist of foliage similar to moss and lichen and they enter into “states of partial torpor” during the day. Therefore, they “are nocturnal, solitary, {{arboreal}} herbivores” that do not travel far at night from their drey because they are small and slow moving. P. mayeri can use sound to communicate. For example, young P. mayeri “use a twitter-like call when in search for their mother and make a <b>screeching</b> <b>noise</b> as an alarm call.” However, they mainly {{communicate with one another}} through their olfactory. For example, males produce a pheromone in the sternal gland that [...] "deters other males" [...] while both females and males [...] "establish home ranges" [...] or [...] "display reproductive status using feces and pheromones." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show that {{computations}} with an aeroacoustic feedback loop, the jet <b>screech</b> <b>noise,</b> can be obtained using truly unstructured grid technology. Numerical results are presented for a nozzle with two different lip thicknesses which will be referred to in this paper as a thin and a thick lip nozzle respectively. The space-time conservation element and solution element (CE/SE) method is used to solve the conservation laws of the compressible axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations. The equations are time marched to predict the unsteady flow and the near-field <b>screech</b> tone <b>noise</b> issuing from an underexpanded circular jet. The CE/SE method uses an unstructured grid based data structure. The unstructured grids for these calculations are generated based on the method of Delaunay triangulation. Comparisons of numerical results with available experimental data are shown for flows corresponding to several different jet Mach numbers. Generally good agreement is obtained in terms of flow physics, screech tone frequency, and sound pressure level...|$|R

5000|$|Güney and Çehre {{were married}} on 30 January 1967, at the Hilton Hotel in Istanbul, Turkey, {{and it was}} the first {{marriage}} for each of them. However, their marriage was, at many stages, not without its disputes, troubles or violence. According to witnesses, Güney and Çehre were [...] "madly in love with one another." [...] Abdurrahman Keskiner, who had been Güneys close friend and personal manager and a close acquaintance of both Güney and Çehre during the time, would later describe in an interview that, [...] "they and Çehre had a very passionate and intensely severe love, full of quarrels and beatings. Nebahat would get beaten up a lot by Yılmaz." [...] A particularly renowned incident that had occurred between Güney and Çehre and which has been described by several individuals who knew them, involves Çehre to leave home and board a train with her brother Tayyar without the knowledge of Güney, and go to the northwestern Turkish city of Eskişehir, to visit her relatives. Güney, upon discovering this, pursues the train within his car, drives ahead and parks his automobile on the train tracks. As the train reaches Güney with a <b>screeching</b> <b>noise,</b> Güney maintains his calm composure, enters the train after it has stopped, collects Çehre and takes her back home to Istanbul.|$|E
40|$|A {{focus of}} the railway {{industry}} over the past decades has been to research, find and develop methods to mitigate noise and vibration resulting from wheel/rail contact along track infrastructure. This resulted {{in a wide range}} of abatement measures that are available for today’s engineers. The suitability of each method must be analysed through budget and timeframe limitations, which includes building, maintenance and inspection costs and time allocation, while also aiming at delivering other benefits, such as environmental impact and durability of infrastructure. There are several situations that need noise and vibration mitigation methods, but each design allocates different priorities on a case-by-case basis. Traditionally, the disturbance caused by railways to the community are generated by wheel/rail contact sound radiation that is expressed in different ways, depending on the movement of the rolling stock and track alignment, such as rolling noise, impact noise and curve noise. More specifically, in special trackworks such as turnouts (or called “switches and crossings”), there are two types of noise that can often be observed: impact noise and <b>screeching</b> <b>noise.</b> With respect to the screeching (or flanging), its mitigation methods are usually associated with curve lubrications. In contrast, the impact noise emerges from the sound made by the rolling stock moving through joints and discontinuities (i. e., gaps), resulting in various noise abatement features to minimise such noise impact. Life cycle analysis is therefore vital for cost efficiency benchmarking of the mitigation methods. The evaluation is based on available data from open literature and the total costs were estimated from valid industry reports to maintain coherency. A 50 -year period for a life cycle analysis is chosen for this study. As for the general parameters, an area with a high density of people is considered to estimate the values for a community with very strict limits for noise and vibration...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of nozzle exit geometry on jet mixing and noise production was studied experimentally {{for a series}} of rectangular nozzles operating at supersonic jet velocities. Both converging (C) and converging-diverging (C-D) nozzles were built with asymmetrical (single bevel) and symmetrical (double bevel) exit chambers and with conventional straight exits for comparison. About a four decibel reduction of peak mixing noise was observed for the double bevelled C-D nozzle operated at design pressure ratio. All bevelled geometries provided <b>screech</b> <b>noise</b> reduction for under-expanded jets and an upstream mixing noise directivity shift which would be beneficial for improved acoustic treatment performance of a shrouded system...|$|R

Bunnell's commentary was often characterized by multiple clichés, over-dramatic descriptions of the struggle between good and evil, the police and criminals, victims and abusers, etc. Although Bunnell hosted and commented {{on most of the}} show, most police video segments were dubbed with the actual law enforcement officials acting in the situation presented. Tire <b>screeching</b> <b>noises,</b> horn beeps, automobile collision sounds and sirens are often overdubbed into these segments. This is especially noticeable in footage where vehicles are driving over dry grass or sand, and the sounds of tire screeching can still be heard.|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of hydrodynamic instability modes self-excited by harmonically related natural screech tones was experimentally investigated. A convergent rectangular nozzle with an aspect ratio of 9. 63 {{was used to}} produce a supersonic shock containing jet. Measurements in the flow-field were made using standard hot-film probes positioned only in the subsonic (outer) portions of the flow. The hydrodynamic instability mode observed in the shear layer at the screech frequency was observed to be antisymmetric (sinuous) about the smaller dimension of the jet, whereas its harmonic was observed to be symmetric (varicose). In addition, the near-field noise measurements indicated that the radiated <b>screech</b> tone <b>noise</b> was out of phase {{on either side of}} the small jet dimension whereas its harmonic was in phase over the same region. To our knowledge such an observation on the nature of the harmonic has thus far gone unreported and therefore is the focus of the present work. The hydrodynamic instability modes occurring at the screech frequency and its harmonic satisfied the conditions for resonance. Detailed measurements of the coherent wave evolution in the streamwise and spanwise directions indicated that strong spanwise variations were present beyond x/h = 8. Details of the <b>screech</b> <b>noise</b> radiated by the coherent instability modes are also presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The noise {{reduction}} and nozzle performance characteristics of large-scale, high-aspect-ratio multielement nozzle arrays operated at low velocities {{were determined by}} test. The nozzles are selected for application to high-aspect-ratio augmentor suppressors {{to be used for}} augmentor wing airplanes. Significant improvements in noise characteristics for multielement nozzles over those of round or high-aspect-ratio slot nozzles are obtained. Elliptical noise patterns typical of slot nozzles are presented for high-aspect-ratio multielement nozzle arrays. Additional advantages are available in OASPL {{noise reduction}} from the element size and spacing. Augmentor-suppressor systems can be designed for maximum beam pattern directivity and frequency spectrum shaping advantages. Measurements of the nozzle wakes show a correlation with noise level data and frequency spectrum peaks.

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to explore the effects of vortex generators, {{in the form of}} tabs projecting normally into the jet, on the mixing and the far-field noise characteristics of a jet. A converging-diverging nozzle with a design Mach number of 1. 36 was used in the experiments. The flow regimes from subsonic to highly underexpanded supersonic conditions were studied. One, two, and four tabs were used and some of the findings of previous investigators were examined and confirmed. The tabs eliminated <b>screech</b> <b>noise</b> from moderately overexpanded cases to highly underexpanded cases. Detailed flow visualizations and measurements showed that two tabs bifurcated the jet at all Mach numbers. While the effect of two tabs was persistent and the jet remained bifurcated, the distortions produced by one and four tabs disappeared by a streamwise distance of approximately 16 jet diameters. Two and four tabs significantly increased the entrainment of ambient air into the jet...|$|R
