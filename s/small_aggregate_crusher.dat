40|$|ABSTRACT: In acute lung injury, a {{decrease}} in surface-active large aggregates {{and an increase in}} the less surface-active <b>small</b> surfactant <b>aggregates</b> are observed. The objective of the current study was to determine if the increase in <b>small</b> <b>aggregates</b> interfered with the function of large aggregates, thereby independently contributing to lung dysfunction. Isolated large <b>aggregates,</b> <b>small</b> <b>aggregates,</b> and large aggregatezsmall aggregate combinations were analysed for in vitro surface activity utilizing a pulsating bubble surfactometer. Subsequently, large <b>aggregates,</b> <b>small</b> <b>aggregates,</b> and large aggregatez <b>small</b> <b>aggregate</b> combinations were administered to surfactant-deficient, adult Sprague-Dawley rats. Physiological parameters were measured during 1 h of ventilation. After sacrifice, the whole lung lavage was analysed for protein concentration, and surface activity of the recovered large aggregates. The minimum surface tension of the large aggregatezsmall aggregate preparations (10 mN?m- 1) was significantly higher than large aggregates alone (1 mN?m- 1), but lower than <b>small</b> <b>aggregates</b> alone (21 mN?m- 1) after 100 pulsations. In vivo, rats receiving large aggregateszsmall aggregates showed immediate increases in oxygena-tion, similar to animals given large aggregates, whereas animals given <b>small</b> <b>aggregates</b> and control animals maintained low oxygenation values. In conclusion, <b>small</b> <b>aggregates</b> interfered with large aggregates function in vitro, but this was not observed in vivo in this experimental model...|$|R
40|$|Pulmonary {{surfactant}} {{obtained from}} lung lavages can be separated by differential centrifugation into two distinct subfractions known as large surfactant <b>aggregates</b> and <b>small</b> surfactant <b>aggregates.</b> The large-aggregate fraction is the precursor of the small-aggregate fraction. The {{ratio of the}} small non-surface-active to large surface-active surfactant aggregates increases after birth and in several types of lung injury. We have utilized an in vitro system, surface area cycling, to study the conversion of large into <b>small</b> <b>aggregates.</b> <b>Small</b> <b>aggregates</b> generated by surface area cycling were separated from large aggregates by centrifugation at 40, 000 g for 15 min {{rather than by the}} normal sucrose gradient centrifugation. This new separation method was validated by morphological studies. Surface-tension-reducing activity of total surfactant extracts, as measured with a pulsating-bubble surfactometer, was impaired after surface area cycling. This impairment was related to the generation of <b>small</b> <b>aggregates.</b> Immunoblot analysis of large and <b>small</b> <b>aggregates</b> separated by sucrose gradient centrifugation revealed the presence of detectable amounts of surfactant-associated protein B (SP-B) in large aggregates but not in <b>small</b> <b>aggregates.</b> SP-A was detectable in both large and <b>small</b> <b>aggregates.</b> PAGE of cycled and non-cycled surfactant showed a reduction in SP-B after surface area cycling. We conclude that SP-B is degraded during the formation of <b>small</b> <b>aggregates</b> in vitro and that a change in surface area appears to be necessary for exposing SP-B to protease activity...|$|R

The study was conducted for medium grade concrete (concrete having cube compressive strength at 28 days between 6 Mpa to 50 Mpa). There is a general belief that <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates</b> contribute higher strength in concreting compared to uncrushed aggregates. Contrary to this belief, our study revealed: uncrushed aggregates perform better than <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates</b> in gaining strength for medium grade concrete. From the laboratory test of strength determination it was explored that uncrushed aggregate provide more strength (22 % at 28 days) than <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates</b> for medium grade concrete. Similar results were found for low grade concrete (cube strength at 28 days up to 15 Mpa) in a previous study relevant to mention: uncrushed aggregate is cheaper than <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregate</b> in the market of Bangladesh. Consequently, concrete with uncrushed aggregates will be cheaper. It can be concluded that uncrushed aggregates are appropriate for medium grade concrete for better performance {{in terms of strength}} and economy.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a laboratory investigation on the characterization of recycled crushed brick when blended with recycled concrete <b>aggregate</b> and <b>crushed</b> rock for pavement sub-base applications. The engineering properties of the crushed brick blends were compared with typical state road authority specifications in Australia for pavement sub-base systems to ascertain the potential use of crushed brick blends in these applications. The experimental programme included particle-size distribution, modified Proctor compaction, particle density, water absorption, California bearing ratio (CBR), Los Angeles abrasion, pH, organic content, and repeated load triaxial tests. Laboratory tests were undertaken on mixtures of 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, 25 %, 30 %, 40 %, and 50 % crushed brick blended with recycled concrete <b>aggregate</b> or <b>crushed</b> rock. The research indicates that up to 25 % crushed brick could be safely added to recycled concrete <b>aggregate</b> and <b>crushed</b> rock blends in pavement sub-base applications.

40|$|Due to {{increasingly}} strict {{environmental regulations}} regarding extraction of gravel the concrete industry {{need to reduce}} the use of gravel {{and replace it with}} <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates</b> in concrete. Gravel is very suitable for concrete because of its round grain shape with a smooth surface and very often also a suitable particle size distribution. <b>Crushed</b> <b>aggregates</b> very often have a more flake grain shape and higher content of fine particles. The characteristic of <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates</b> depends on parameters such as; type of rock, crushing method and degree of refinement. With a suitable rock type and by choosing the right crushing setup it is possible to produce <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates</b> for concrete. The use of VSI crushers may improve the grain shape but is not always necessary. In case of very high content of fines an air classifier can be used to reduce the filler content (or by washing). Concrete consists of cement, water, aggregates and very often also additional materials and admixtures. Replacing gravel with <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregate</b> as a direct 1 : 1 substitute might be difficult because of the grain shape of <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates</b> and its higher fine content. Very often mix-design adjustments are required to achieve the same concrete properties as with gravel and to ensure the fresh concrete workability it might be needed to increase the cement paste. For environmental and concrete technical reasons, it is desirable to substitute gravel with <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates</b> without increasing the cement paste and to succeed, it requires some kind of refinement of the hard rock. When choosing crush methods to improve the properties of the <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates</b> decisions always include economic considerations and it is necessary to understand how varying degrees of processing effect the concrete properties. This include a need for test methods that makes it possible to determine if a crushed material is good enough for concrete. This master thesis aims to investigate if it is possible to determine if a <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregate</b> is suitable for concrete by using some practical and simple aggregate test methods. Aggregates with different degree of refinement has been used in the study; conventional crushed and materials processed with a VSI and an air classifier. Fine aggregates 0 / 4 mm and also the properties of the fines, particles smaller than 0, 25 mm, {{have a major impact on}} the concrete workability so focus in this investigation is <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates</b> <b>smaller</b> than 4 mm. The results from this work show that there are correlations between the outcomes from aggregate tests and from concrete tests and that it is possible to assess if a crushed material is suitable for concrete without carry out a large scale concrete tests. It is difficult to assess a material with only one single aggregate test method but a combination of two tests methods describes well how the material will behave in a concrete. Important when producing <b>crushed</b> <b>aggregates</b> for concrete is the particle shape and the particle size distribution. These two parameters are important for how the material affects the concrete properties and aggregate test methods that can describe these parameters are desirable.
