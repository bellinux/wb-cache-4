5|$|Mehldau has {{expressed}} an interest in, and knowledge of, philosophy and literature. In a 2003 interview he commented on romanticism and nostalgia, linking pleasure and pain to musical expression: I love {{the part of the}} Orpheus myth where he is allowed to take his wife out of Hades on the condition that he doesn't look back at her for the trip on the river Styx. When he can't help himself, he looks back, and she is pulled back downstream away from him, taken away forever. Music is that moment right when he looks at her: <b>seeing</b> <b>something</b> that you love for an instant being taken away forever. There's an element of folly to the whole thing – you look even though you know you shouldn't. Music kind of yokes together the feeling of attainment and the feeling of loss at the same time.|$|E

According to critics, the eyewitness testimony was actually a collection of inconsistent and contradictory accounts.

His family {{told investigators that}} Tobares was once taken {{to one of his}} boss' private islands to cook at an exclusive party, so they suspect he encountered problems there. While on the island, he was not allowed to leave for a few days and was prohibited from using his cellphone. Investigators also believe Tobares may have been kidnapped by a rival gang as part of a retaliation campaign against his employers. His car was located two weeks after his disappearance in Michoacán, but no traces of Tobares' whereabouts were identified.|$|E
500|$|In {{the video}} for [...] "Single Ladies", {{emphasis}} is laid on Beyoncé's more aggressive and sensual side, her alter ego Sasha Fierce. It shows {{her in an}} asymmetrical leotard and high-heels, with two backup dancers, Ebony Williams and Ashley Everett. Beyoncé's mother, Tina Knowles, designed the high-cut leotards after <b>seeing</b> <b>something</b> similar in the American musical films A Chorus Line and All That Jazz. The dance routine incorporates many styles, including jazz, tap, and hip hop, and is credited with popularizing J-Setting, a flamboyant lead and follow dance style prominent in many African American gay clubs across Atlanta and used by the all-female Prancing J-Settes dance troupe of Jackson State University.|$|E
500|$|A {{philosophy}} {{of mind that}} regards the degrees of freedom between mental and physical well-being as not necessarily synonymous and thus implying an experiential dualism between body and mind. [...] As example of these disparate degrees of freedom is given by Allan Wallace who notes that it is, [...] "experientially apparent that one may be physically uncomfortable—for instance, while engaging in a strenuous physical workout—while mentally cheerful; conversely, one may be mentally distraught while experiencing physical comfort." [...] Experiential dualism notes that our subjective experience of merely <b>seeing</b> <b>something</b> {{in the physical world}} seems qualitatively different than mental processes like grief that comes from losing a loved one for instance. [...] This philosophy also is a proponent of causal dualism which is defined as the dual ability for mental states and physical states to affect one another. [...] Mental states can cause changes in physical states and vice versa.|$|E

500|$|... another non-fiction travelogue which Steinbeck {{wrote in}} 1962, {{is seen as}} a more rounded view of the author late in life, but The Log from the Sea of Cortez is {{regarded}} as showing the direct influence of Ed Ricketts and his philosophies on Steinbeck, and provides clues to the underlying rationales for some events in his novels. In particular, [...] "About Ed Ricketts" [...] reveals how closely he was tied to the characters in Steinbeck's novels: parts are taken almost verbatim from descriptions of [...] "Doc" [...] in Cannery Row. The book is also important for <b>seeing</b> <b>something</b> of Ed Ricketts himself. It was the only example of his philosophical writings published in his lifetime. The [...] "Essay on Non-teleological Thinking" [...] was part of a trilogy of philosophical essays he had written before the trip, and which, with Steinbeck's help, he continued to try to have published until his death.|$|E
500|$|Nolan {{chooses to}} {{minimize}} the amount of computer-generated imagery for special effects in his films, preferring to use practical effects whenever possible, only using CGI to enhance elements which he has photographed in camera. For instance, his films Batman Begins, Inception and Interstellar featured 620, 500 and 850 visual-effects shots, respectively, which is considered minor when compared with contemporary visual-effects epics which may have upwards of 1,500 to 2,000 VFX shots: [...] "I believe in an absolute difference between animation and photography. However sophisticated your computer-generated imagery is, if it's been created from no physical elements and you haven't shot anything, it's going to feel like animation. There are usually two different goals in a visual effects movie. One is to fool the audience into <b>seeing</b> <b>something</b> seamless, and that's how I try to use it. The other is to impress the audience {{with the amount of}} money spent on the spectacle of the visual effect, and that, I have no interest in".|$|E
500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised it as [...] "a {{new movie}} {{landmark}} of cruelty and transcendence" [...] and as [...] "a {{movie about a}} life that gets taken away, and that's why it lets us touch what life is". He also commented very positively about Ejiofor's performance, while further stating, [...] "12 Years a Slave lets us stare at the primal sin of America with open eyes, and at moments {{it is hard to}} watch, yet it's a movie of such humanity and grace that at every moment, you feel you're <b>seeing</b> <b>something</b> essential. It is Chiwetel Ejiofor's extraordinary performance that holds the movie together, and that allows us to watch it without blinking. He plays Solomon with a powerful inner strength, yet he never soft-pedals the silent nightmare that is Solomon's daily existence." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone, gave the film a four-star rating and said: [...] "you won't be able to tuck this powder keg in the corner of your mind and forget it. What {{we have here is a}} blistering, brilliant, straight-up classic." [...] He later named the film the best movie of 2013.|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker {{gave the}} episode an A, posing the question: [...] "Has there {{ever been a}} TV show more aptly named than Glee? It both embodies and inspires exactly that quality." [...] Glee was the top ranked topic on social {{networking}} site Twitter {{on the night of}} its initial airing. Alessandra Stanley for The New York Times called the show [...] "blissfully unoriginal in a witty, imaginative way", saying the characters are [...] "high school archetypes" [...] but noted [...] "a strong satiric pulse that doesn’t diminish the characters’ identities or dim the showmanship of a talented cast". The Daily News David Hinckley wrote that the show [...] "isn't close to perfect" [...] but [...] "has likable characters, {{a good sense of humor}} and a reasonably deft touch with music." [...] He called the pilot episode [...] "not very plausible" [...] but [...] "potentially heartwarming", writing of the musical choices: [...] "The duet of [...] "You're the One That I Want" [...] from Grease may be a little obvious, but setting a group dance routine to Amy Winehouse's [...] "Rehab" [...] shows some inspiration. Whether Glee can hold that note remains a very unanswered question. But it will at least be worth watching to see." [...] USA Today Robert Bianco assessed: [...] "There's a lot to like here: the exuberance of the musical numbers, the bite to the comedy and the joy of <b>seeing</b> <b>something</b> different. It has casting and tone problems, but it has all summer to fix them." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 25, 1983, Jackson {{reunited with}} his {{brothers}} for a performance taped at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium for , an NBC television special. The show aired on May 16, 1983, to an estimated audience of , and featured the Jacksons and other Motown stars. It is best remembered for Jackson's solo performance of [...] "Billie Jean", which earned Jackson his first Emmy nomination. Wearing a distinctive black-sequined jacket and a golf glove decorated with rhinestones, he debuted his signature dance move, the moonwalk, which former Soul Train dancer and Shalamar member Jeffrey Daniel had taught him three years earlier. Jackson had originally turned down the invitation to perform at the show, believing {{he had been doing}} too much television at the time; at the request of Motown founder Berry Gordy, he agreed to perform in exchange for time to do a solo performance. According to Rolling Stone reporter Mikal Gilmore, [...] "There are times when you know you are hearing or <b>seeing</b> <b>something</b> extraordinary ... that came that night." [...] Jackson's performance drew comparisons to Elvis Presley's and the Beatles' appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show. Anna Kisselgoff of The New York Times wrote in 1988: [...] "The moonwalk that he made famous is an apt metaphor for his dance style. How does he do it? As a technician, he is a great illusionist, a genuine mime. His ability to keep one leg straight as he glides while the other bends and seems to walk requires perfect timing." [...] Gordy said of the performance: [...] "From the first beat of 'Billie Jean', I was mesmerized, and when he did his iconic moonwalk, I was shocked, it was magic, Michael Jackson went into orbit, and never came down." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ann Snitow’s {{reaction}} to Beloved neatly illustrates how Morrison criticism began to evolve and move toward new modes of interpretation. In her 1987 review of Beloved, Snitow argues that Beloved, the ghost {{at the center}} of the narrative, is [...] "too light" [...] and [...] "hollow", rendering the entire novel [...] "airless". Snitow changed her position after reading criticism that interpreted Beloved in a different way, <b>seeing</b> <b>something</b> more complicated and burdened than a literal ghost, something requiring different forms of creative expression and critical interpretation. The conflicts at work here are ideological as well as critical: they concern the definition and evaluation of American and African-American literature, the relationship between art and politics, and the tension between recognition and appropriation.|$|E

2500|$|The {{rudiments of}} a {{biological}} {{basis for the}} mind's eye {{is found in the}} deeper portions of the brain below the neocortex, or where the center of perception exists. [...] The thalamus {{has been found to be}} discrete to other components in that it processes all forms of perceptional data relayed from both lower and higher components of the brain. [...] Damage to this component can produce permanent perceptual damage, however when damage is inflicted upon the cerebral cortex, the brain adapts to neuroplasticity to amend any occlusions for perception. [...] It can be thought that the neocortex is a sophisticated memory storage warehouse in which data received as an input from sensory systems are compartmentalized via the cerebral cortex. [...] This would essentially allow for shapes to be identified, although given the lack of filtering input produced internally, one may as a consequence, hallucinate - essentially <b>seeing</b> <b>something</b> that isn't received as an input externally but rather internal (i.e. an error in the filtering of segmented sensory data from the cerebral cortex may result in one seeing, feeling, hearing or experiencing something that is inconsistent with reality).|$|E
2500|$|Jason Matthews of Legacy Effects, {{successor}} to Stan Winston Studios, {{was hired to}} turn production designer Tom Meyer's robot designs into practical animatronic props. He said, [...] "We have 26-and-a-half total live-action robots that were made for this film. They all have hydraulic neck controls. Atom has RC [...] hands as well." [...] According to Jackman, executive producer Spielberg [...] "actually said to Shawn, 'You should really have real elements where you can.' ... Basically if they're not walking or fighting, that's a real robot." [...] Levy added that Spielberg gave the example of Jurassic Park, where Winston's animatronic dinosaurs [...] "got a better performance from the actors, as they were <b>seeing</b> <b>something</b> real, and gave the visual effects team {{an idea of what}} it would look like." [...] As Real Steel was not based on a toy, Meyer said that [...] "there was no guideline" [...] for the robots, and each was designed from scratch, with an attempt to put [...] "different personality and aesthetics," [...] according to Levy. In Atom's case, it tried to have a more humanizing design to be an [...] "everyman" [...] who could attract the audience's sympathy and serve as a proxy to the viewer, with a fencing mask that Meyer explained served to show [...] "his identity was a bit hidden, so you have to work harder to get to see him." [...] Executive producer Robert Zemeckis added that the mask [...] "became a screen so we can project what we want on Atom's face." [...] Damage was added to the robots' decoration to show how they were machines worn out by intense battles.|$|E
