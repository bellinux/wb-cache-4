For the sphere, the problem is to construct all the circles (the boundaries of spherical caps) that are tangent to three given circles on the sphere. This spherical {{problem can be}} rendered into a corresponding planar problem using <b>stereographic</b> <b>projection.</b> Once the solutions to the planar problem have been constructed, the corresponding solutions to the spherical problem can be determined by inverting the <b>stereographic</b> <b>projection.</b> Even more generally, one can consider the problem of four tangent curves that result from the intersections of an arbitrary quadratic surface and four planes, a problem first considered by Charles Dupin.|$|E

Some explicit formulas {{for the basic}} fields and for the connection components in stereographic and in spherical coordinates are presented. 1. <b>Stereographic</b> <b>projections</b> of the sphere S 3. It is known that the closed homogeneous and isotropic universe is described by a manifold diffeomorphic to the Cartesian product of the three-dimensional sphere S 3 by a straight line: M = R × S 3 (see § 111 and § 112 in [1]). The sphere S 3 is a manifold that can be covered with two local charts. We choose <b>stereographic</b> <b>projections</b> from two diametrically opposite points (we call them North and South poles) to their equatorial hyperplane. The sphere S 3 is naturally presented as a threedimensional hypersurface in the four-dimensional space R 4 with the standard Euclidean metric. Let z be a point on such a sphere with the radius R. Then z/R is a point on the unit sphere. Let x and y be the <b>stereographic</b> <b>projections</b> of z/R.

The development of this technique as an element-specific real-space surface crystallography that is sensitive to interatomic spacings in the surface and subsurface layers of a crystal is described. This projection imaging method {{is based on the}} blocking of atomic trajectories scattered from subsurface layers by atoms in layers nearer to the surface. The resulting magnification of the blocking cones, as captured by a gated position-sensitive microchannel plate detector, is similar to 10 (9). The images of the blocking patterns provide direct information on interatomic spacings and surface symmetry and structure. Classical ion trajectory simulations using the three-dimensional scattering and recoiling imaging code (SARIC) are used to simulate the <b>stereographic</b> <b>projections</b> and blocking patterns and to provide quantitative interpretations. The method is sensitive to interatomic spacings in the surface and subsurface layers.
