Ratnakara, in his text Haravijaya, also describes this feat of Chamunda, but solely credits Chamunda, not the other matrikas of <b>sipping</b> the blood of Andhaka. Having drunk the blood, Chamunda's complexion changed to blood-red. The text further says that Chamunda does a dance of destruction, playing a musical instrument whose shaft is Mount Meru, the spring is the cosmic snake Shesha and gourd is the crescent moon. She plays the instrument during the deluge that drowns the world.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Session Initiation Protocol (<b>SIP)</b> is {{a general}} {{protocol}} for session setup and management, e. g., for VoIP. Current <b>SIP</b> networks build on a fixed infrastructure that relies on static network entities. General problems with this infrastructure, e. g., in ubiquitous ad-hoc networks, lead to a trend of integrating peer-to-peer mechanisms into <b>SIP.</b> We propose a generic architecture for decentralised <b>SIP</b> networks. The <b>SIP</b> location service of our architecture is based on JXTA for message routing. This allows <b>SIP</b> networks without central location services, and in extreme even without central <b>SIP</b> proxies. Unlike other approaches, we do not modify <b>SIP.</b> Thus, standard <b>SIP</b> clients can be seamlessly integrated. Due to the flexibility of JXTA, various peer-to-peer algorithms can be integrated according to current requirements. Additionally, our architecture supports registration, discovery and locating of services based on <b>SIP.</b> This saves resources in end terminals and also benefits from the peer-to-peer approach. ...|$|R
