40|$|Research on convective-diffusive fluid motions in porous {{media has}} a notable {{relevance}} (increasing {{with the number}} of salts dissolved in the fluid) either for geophysical applications (engineering <b>geology,</b> <b>subsurface</b> and structural <b>geology,</b> <b>subsurface</b> contaminant transport, underground water flow, [...] .) or because porous materials occur very frequently in real life (fiber materials for insulating purposes, metallic foams in heat transfer devices ([1, 13]). In the present paper porous horizontal layers, heated from below and salted from above and below, in the Darcy-Boussinesq scheme, are investigated. By virtue of the absence of subcritical instabilities ([20]), the bifurcating competition of Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers for promoting or inhibiting the onset of convection, investigated through the linearized equations, allows to show ([20]) that this competition can be restricted to the inequalities (2) which are necessary and sufficient for inhibiting the onset of convection. But while the onset of convection requires that only one of (3) holds, the stability requires that, at least, all the reverse of (3) hold. Therefore, either for theoretical reasons or for practical use of stability conditions, the problem of overcoming this gap arises. We call one stability condition (OSC) problem the looking for inequalities of type (4) able to inhibit the onset of convection for large sets of values of the bifurcating parameters with special attention to the case {α= 3,g= 0 } since in this case (4) is necessary and sufficient for inhibiting the onset of convection. To this goal new fields for the salts densities are introduced. These transformations allow to: i) discover skew-symmetries hidden in the Darcy-Boussinesq equations; ii) obtain meaningful contributions to the OSC proble...|$|R

40|$|Integrated geophysical, geochemical and hydrogeological {{modelling}} {{techniques have}} been used in this PhD research study to characterise the ground contamination at four study sites. The primary aim of the research is to study the efficiency of using an integrated approach to study hydrocarbon and heavy metal contamination in the <b>subsurface</b> soil, <b>geology</b> and groundwater systems. Each of the four sites have different industrial legacies (hence types of contamination) and periods of operation. The sites in increasing age are: Bromsgrove landfill, Cathays Railway Depot, Barry Docks and Weston-Super-Mare gasworks. The geophysical methods used in this study are Electrical Resistivity imaging (IRIS) and multifrequency ground conductivity (Gem- 2). These techniques can map the electrical properties of the sub-surface in both 2 D and 3 D. The electrical properties are then compared with independent professional geochemical sampling programmes for both soil and groundwater. The results of this project show that the geophysical methods provide a clear indication of the zones of ground contamination (hydrocarbons and heavy metals) in both 2 D and 3 D. Electrical resistivity/conductivity mapping using both independent techniques show consistent results. The geophysical results also show a good correlation with the geochemical sampling programmes for soil, water and gas. The results are encouraging in that geophysics could be used more widely in professional contaminated land site investigations to supplement conventional invasive techniques and sampling programmes. The research has also investigated whether geophysical parameters such as electrical conductivity {{could be used as a}} groundwater modelling parameter in the Visual Modflow software. The advantage being that geophysics can provide a high intensity of data in 3 D and even temporal 4 D at a site. The geophysical results can define an accurate spatial distribution of the contaminated area. This can be used to assign a ‘concentration recharge’ in the modelling compared to the normal practice of using chemical data from a small number of discrete sampling points.

40|$|In {{this opinion}} paper we contend that {{high-resolution}} characterization, monitoring, and prediction {{are the key}} elements to advancing and reducing uncertainty in our understanding and prediction of subsurface processes at basin scales. First, we advocate that recently developed tomographic surveying is an effective and high-resolution approach for characterizing the field-scale subsurface. Fusion {{of different types of}} tomographic surveys further enhances the characterization. A basin is an appropriate scale for many water resources management purposes. We thereby propose the expansion of the tomographic surveying and data fusion concept to basin-scale characterization. In order to facilitate basin-scale tomographic surveys, different types of passive, basin-scale, CAT scan technologies are suggested that exploit recurrent natural stimuli (e. g., lightning, earthquakes, storm events, barometric variations, river-stage variations, etc.) as sources of excitations, along with implementation of sensor networks that provide long-term and spatially distributed monitoring of excitation as well as response signals on the land surface and in the subsurface. This vision for basin-scale subsurface characterization faces many significant technological challenges and requires interdisciplinary collaborations (e. g., surface and <b>subsurface</b> hydrology, geophysics, <b>geology,</b> geochemistry, information and sensor technology, applied mathematics, atmospheric science, etc.).

We measured the variability of the dune morphology in this desert on the basis of LANDSAT ETM+ data, and we detected the bedrock landforms beneath the aeolian sands by applying gravity methods. Wind records from stations at the periphery of the desert and SRTM topographical data were examined also to augment the interpretation.

In addition to coseismic deformation related to the deep earthquake source, InSAR revealed three sharp surface displacement gradients. One of them is extensional and is inconsistent with the westward interseismic shortening of ~ 45 mm yr- 1 in this region. The gradient sharpness suggests slip triggering on shallow structures, {{some of which were}} not well documented before. To characterize these shallow structures, we investigated potential surface ruptures in the field. Sets of ~NS tension cracks distributed over 25 - 300 m width, with cumulative extension in the same order as InSAR observations, were found along 5. 5 km distance along the extensional gradient and are interpreted as surface rupture. We build two E-W regional balanced cross-sections, based on surface <b>geology,</b> <b>subsurface</b> data, and coseismic and interseismic geodetic data.
