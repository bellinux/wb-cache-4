50|$|Unlike other printer types, pen plotter {{speed is}} {{measured}} by pen speed and acceleration rate, instead of by page printing speed. A pen plotter's speed is primarily limited {{by the type of}} pen used, so the choice of pen is a key factor in pen plotter output speed. Indeed, most modern pen plotters have commands to control <b>slewing</b> <b>speed,</b> {{depending on the type of}} pen currently in use.|$|E
40|$|Project RAEGE (Red Atlantica de Estaciones Geodinamicas y Espaciales) {{intends to}} set up a Spanish-Portuguese network of four Geodetic Fundamental Stations in Yebes (1), Canary Islands (1), and A cores Islands (2), as part of the {{developments}} needed for the IVS VLBI 2010 scenario. It is envisaged that each Geodetic Fundamental Station will be equipped with one radio telescope of VLBI 2010 specifications (at least 12 -m diameter, fast <b>slewing</b> <b>speed,</b> but also able to operate up to 40 GHz), one gravimeter, one permanent GNSS station, and, at least at the Yebes site, one SLR facility. The National Geographical Institute of Spain (IGN) has experience in VLBI, having {{been a member of the}} European VLBI Network since 1993 and being one of the founding institutions of the Joint Institute for VLBI in Europe (JIVE), and it has been participating in geodetic VLBI campaigns with the 14 -m radio telescope in Yebes since 1995. A new 40 -m radio telescope has been built and was recently put into operation. It regularly participates in IVS sessions. There is infrastructure available for the new stations at Yebes and the Canary Islands. An agreement between IGN, the Portuguese Geographical Institute (IGP), and the Regional Government of the A cores ensures that the RAEGE project can become a reality by 2013...|$|E
50|$|The ex-GNR {{low level}} lines are now {{electrified}} and {{known as the}} East Coast Main Line, they carry heavy express traffic at 100 mph and more. When the line was electrified the tracks were <b>slewed</b> to increase <b>speeds</b> and all trace of the low level station was erased.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a combined nonlinear and circular features extraction-based condition monitoring method for low <b>speed</b> <b>slewing</b> bearing. The proposed method employs the largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE) algorithm {{as a signal}} processing method based on vibration data. LLE is used to detect chaos existence in vibration data in discrete angular positions of the shaft. From the processed data, circular features such as mean, skewness and kurtosis are calculated and monitored. It is shown that the onset and the progressively deteriorating bearing condition can be detected more clearly in circular-domain features compared to time-domain features. The application of the method is demonstrated with laboratory run slewing bearing data...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel application of circular domain features calculation based condition monitoring method for low rotational <b>speed</b> <b>slewing</b> bearing. The method employs data reduction process using piecewise aggregate approximation (PAA) to detect frequency alteration in the bearing signal when the fault occurs. From the processed data, circular domain {{features such as}} circular mean, circular variance, circular skewness and circular kurtosis are calculated and monitored. It is shown that the slight changes of bearing condition during operation can be identified more clearly in circular domain analysis compared to time domain analysis and other advanced signal processing methods such as wavelet decomposition and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) allowing the engineer to better schedule the maintenance work. Four circular domain features were shown to consistently and clearly identify the onset (initiation) of fault from the peak feature value which is not clearly observable in time domain features. The application of the method is demonstrated with simulated data, laboratory slewing bearing data and industrial bearing data from Coal Bridge Reclaimer used in a local steel mill...|$|R
