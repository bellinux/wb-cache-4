5|$|Cal Neva Resort & Casino, {{previously}} {{known as}} the Calneva Resort, Cal-Neva Lodge, is a resort and casino <b>straddling</b> <b>the</b> border between Nevada and California {{on the shores of}} Lake Tahoe. The original building was constructed in 1926, and became famous when the national media picked up a story about actress Clara Bow cancelling checks she owed to the Cal Neva worth $13,000 in 1930. After a fire, the building burnt down in 1937 and was rebuilt over the course of 30 days. In 1960, entertainer Frank Sinatra purchased the Resort alongside Dean Martin and Chicago mobster Sam Giancana.|$|E
5|$|E.J.H. Corner {{defined the}} {{varieties}} M.inclinata var. kinabaluensis and var. subglobospora in his 1994 publication on Agaric mushrooms of Malesia, a biogeographical region <b>straddling</b> <b>the</b> {{boundary of the}} Indomalaya and Australasia ecozones. The variety kinabaluensis (named after its type locality, Kinabalu) has a cap margin that is not scalloped, little or no odor, and cheilocystidia with shorter processes. It was found growing on the dead wood of Lithocarpus havilandii, a stone oak tree in the beech family. Variety subglobospora, found in Sabah, has spores that are almost spherical.|$|E
5|$|From Gallery Place – Chinatown through Judiciary Square, {{the line}} runs southeast, turning east again at D Street to reach Union Station. There it turns north and {{surfaces}} adjacent to Union Station's platforms, follows the Washington Terminal yard tracks north to Brentwood {{where the line}} turns northwestward and again joins CSX Transportation's Metropolitan Subdivision tracks, running in a unique gauntlet arrangement with the freight railroad tracks <b>straddling</b> <b>the</b> Metro tracks. The Red Line continues in this manner northwest across the District-Maryland line, through Takoma and past Silver Spring. It reenters a tunnel at 16th Street and heads north under Georgia Avenue to the end at Glenmont. There is a maintenance yard between the NoMa and Rhode Island Avenue stops.|$|E

5|$|Hannah retired {{following}} {{completion of}} his term as Governor of Queensland. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in August 1977 (backdated to March) as part of Queen ElizabethII's Silver Jubilee visit to Australia. Hannah {{died of a heart}} attack on 22May 1978 at his home in Surfers Paradise, Queensland. He was given a state funeral and cremated; his wife and daughter survived him. Hannah Community Park, <b>straddling</b> <b>the</b> suburbs of Fadden and Gowrie in Canberra, was established in his honour in 2002.|$|E
5|$|The stated {{reason for}} the move was a {{campaign}} promise of Kiribati President Teburoro Tito to eliminate the confusion of Kiribati <b>straddling</b> <b>the</b> Date Line and therefore being constantly in two different days. However, Kiribati officials were not reluctant to attempt {{to capitalize on the}} nation's new status as owners of the first land to see sunrise in 2000. Other Pacific nations, including Tonga and New Zealand's Chatham Islands, protested the move, objecting that it infringed on their claims to be the first land to see dawn in the year 2000.|$|E
5|$|Continuing into Onondaga County and {{the village}} of Jordan, NY31 begins to make a turn northward while {{connecting}} to {{the northern end of}} NY317 (the former northern terminus of NY31C) a short distance north of the village center. With the turn complete, NY31 traverses the CSX mainline and the Thruway via successive overpasses before returning to level ground and resuming an eastward alignment {{in the shadow of the}} Thruway. Once inside the limits of Van Buren, NY31 separates from the Thruway, curving north and intersecting the western terminus of NY173 in quick succession. The alignment remains fairly straight to the outskirts of Baldwinsville, where NY31 turns to the right onto Downer Street to avoid the Seneca River to the immediate north. The eastward progression is limited, however, as NY31 merges with NY690 northward, traversing the Seneca River and <b>straddling</b> <b>the</b> western edge of Baldwinsville.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Ark Royal, the Swordfish loaded torpedoes equipped with contact detonators. The second attack comprised fifteen aircraft and was launched at 19:10. At 20:47, the torpedo bombers began their attack descent through the clouds. As the Swordfish approached, Bismarck fired her main battery at Sheffield, <b>straddling</b> <b>the</b> cruiser with her second salvo. Shell fragments rained down on Sheffield, killing {{three men and}} wounding several others. Sheffield quickly retreated under cover of a smoke screen. The Swordfish then attacked; Bismarck began to turn violently as her anti-aircraft batteries engaged the bombers. One torpedo hit amidships on the port side, just below the bottom edge of the main armour belt. The force of the explosion was largely contained by the underwater protection system and the belt armour but some structural damage caused minor flooding.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the first}} {{skirmish}} in Pakrac in March, a predominantly Serb-populated area {{east of the}} town, <b>straddling</b> <b>the</b> Pakrac–Bučje–Požega road, remained generally {{beyond the control of}} Croatian authorities. In early July, the insurrection spread to the entire area between the towns of Pakrac and Požega and north to the northern slopes of Papuk and Bilogora. This development threatened to interdict the Croatian use of the Varaždin–Osijek road, as it was within range of Croatian Serb artillery near Slatina. After the Serb rebels declared the Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Western Slavonia (SAO Western Slavonia) and expanded the territory under their control to include the town of Okučani, the most significant transport route between Zagreb and Slavonia—the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway between Novska and Nova Gradiška—was severed. SAO Western Slavonia comprised no major settlements. In order to address this deficiency, Croatian Serb forces launched an offensive early on 19 August. The objectives of the offensive were to capture the towns of Grubišno Polje, Daruvar, Pakrac and Lipik, and consolidate the territory of SAO Western Slavonia. The offensive failed after the arrival of Croatian reinforcements from Zagreb and Bjelovar, but the line of control remained in close proximity to the four towns.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of December, the ITCZ was active across the {{southern}} Indian Ocean, northeast of Madagascar. A circulation developed on December16, which preceded {{the development of a}} tropical disturbance on December17. Moving to the west-northwest, the system slowly developed before shifting to the southwest. On December19, the system intensified into a moderate tropical storm while passing 75km (45mi) north of Madagascar. After briefly developing an eye feature, the satellite presentation degraded due to land interaction. Convection increased as the storm progressed through the Mozambique Channel, and the Madagascar Meteorological Service named it Benedicte on December20. The organization improved {{over the next few days}} as the eye feature became better defined. On December23, Benedicte intensified to tropical cyclone status, reaching peak winds of 135km/h (85mph). That day, the storm turned westward toward the Mozambique coast, weakening as it approached land. Benedicte made landfall on central Mozambique on December24 and turned northward, <b>straddling</b> <b>the</b> border with Malawi. The storm dissipated on the next day, with only a remnant area of clouds present on satellite imagery by December26.|$|E
