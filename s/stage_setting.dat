5|$|The promotional {{video for}} the song was filmed in December 1967, for the Central Office of Information in London. The video was {{supposed}} to be about Britain, and was meant to be distributed in the US and Canada. The video features Barrett (shown with an acoustic guitar for the first time) and the group miming to the song in a more conventional <b>stage</b> <b>setting,</b> with psychedelic projections in the background. The original audio to the promo is lost, and most versions use the BBC recording from late 1967, consequently causing sync issues most evident as Barrett sings the opening verse. The original film was considered to be lost, until it was re-discovered in the Manchester Arts Lab in 1999. Barrett and Waters first watched the promo video during the second week of December 1967.|$|E
5|$|The sixth {{match was}} between Triple H and Umaga, voted by the fans to be a Street Fight, where the match {{could take place}} {{anywhere}} in the arena, and any weapon could be used. The match began in the entrance area and involved Umaga getting speared through the <b>stage</b> <b>setting.</b> The match moved to into the audience {{before returning to the}} ring. Several weapons were used, and Umaga splashed Triple H through an announce table. The match ended when Triple H hit Umaga with a sledgehammer and performed a Pedigree to score the victory via pinfall. Mickie James was then announced to be the winner of the Divas Halloween costume contest.|$|E

25|$|When touring, Rundgren {{presented}} {{the music in}} a lavish <b>stage</b> <b>setting</b> that echoed the ambitious space-themed shows of acts like Parliament/Funkadelic and he adopted an outlandish space-rock image on stage, including multi-colored dyed hair.|$|E
25|$|In 1922 Mowinckel staged an {{adaptation}} of Wedekind's play Spring Awakening at Intimteatret. The performance was well received by the public, with standing ovations. This {{was the first time}} Munch's paintings were used at a Norwegian stage. In a retrospective article from 1939 Anton Rønneberg characterized this event as an important day in the history of Norwegian theatre. He pointed at her artistic eye for the <b>stage</b> <b>setting,</b> and for the harmony between stage decorations, costumes, light and choreography.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} summer, {{the space}} {{was ready for the}} inauguration, which took place on September 26, 2003, as faculty {{dedicated}} the space to the former Dean of the Rome Campus, who had been an ardent sponsor of outdoor student drama. The theater then opened with a student-led revival of Shakespeare's classical comedy, A Midsummer Night's Dream (students had originally staged the play on the Rome Campus during the spring of 2002). The <b>stage</b> <b>setting</b> was simple: a post and lintel with two curtains. Over the three night run, approximately 500 total students, faculty, alumni, families, and friends sat on the green hillside and watched the play.|$|E
50|$|<b>Stage</b> <b>Sets</b> were premium {{personal}} spaces where users, if {{they had}} a video capture system, could make their own machinimas in Home. The <b>Stage</b> <b>Sets</b> were available from the Home Estates store in Home's shopping complex.|$|R

50|$|Johann Oswald Harms (baptised 30 April 1643 in Hamburg - 1708 in Braunschweig) was a German Baroque painter, engraver, and {{the first}} notable <b>stage</b> <b>set</b> {{designer}} of the Baroque.

25|$|The <b>stage</b> <b>setting</b> for the show, , the {{high-quality}} (and sometimes very expensive) ingredients used in {{the cooking}} battles, and Kaga's extravagant costumes required the show to have a budget far {{higher than that of}} most other cooking shows. Some statistics: 893 portions of foie gras, 54 sea breams, 827 Ise shrimp, 964 matsutake mushrooms, 4,593 eggs, 1,489 truffles, 4,651grams of caviar, and 84 pieces of shark fin were used during the show, bringing the total grocery bill to ¥843,354,407 (or about $7,115,520). One of the most expensive battles was Battle Swallow's Nest, which ran over $40,000 solely for that ingredient, not counting large quantities of shark's fin; for the battle, the producers were permitted to return any unused portions to Hattori Nutrition College.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of his seventh season at Real Madrid, the 2015–16 campaign, Ronaldo became the club's all-time top scorer, first in the league and then in all competitions. His five-goal haul in a 6–0 away win over Espanyol on 12 September took his tally in La Liga to 230 goals in 203 games, surpassing the club's {{previous}} recordholder, Raúl. A month later, on 17 October, he again surpassed Raúl when he scored the second goal in a 3–0 defeat of Levante at the Bernabéu to take his overall total for the club to 324 goals. Ronaldo also became the all-time top scorer in the Champions League with a hat-trick in the first group match against Shakhtar Donetsk, having finished the previous season level with Messi on 77 goals. A brace against Malmö FF, scoring in a 2–0 away win on 30 September, saw him reach the milestone of 500 career goals for both club and country. He subsequently became the first player to score double figures in the competition's group <b>stage,</b> <b>setting</b> the record at 11 goals, including another four-goal haul against Malmö.|$|E
500|$|The video commences {{by showing}} a {{drive-in}} {{theater in the}} day. Cyrus later arrives in a black 1979 Pontiac Trans Am, clothed by a black tank top, distressed hot pants, cowboy boots and a black vest. Cyrus and several female extras {{make their way to}} a blue pick-up truck, where Cyrus sings using a digital microphone and the extras accompany her. In the song's second verse, Cyrus lies against a wall depicting the drive-in's name, [...] "Corral Drive-In". Then, an American flag unravels before a single wall in a vacant landscape, where she performs as sparkled confetti drops from above. Later, she, standing on a swing in the center, and numerous backup dancers appear in a jungle gym during the evening. For the song's last refrain, Cyrus performs with four backup dancers on a stage, where the background portrays the American flag and letters above it that spell [...] "USA". Cut-scenes feature people entering the drive-in theater, Cyrus walking throughout the drive-in alone, or her and the backup dancers performing in the jungle gym. The video ends with Cyrus flipping her hair in the <b>stage</b> <b>setting.</b>|$|E

500|$|Live {{shows on}} Tool's {{headline}} tour incorporate an unorthodox <b>stage</b> <b>setting</b> and video display. Keenan and Carey {{line up in}} the back on elevated platforms, while Jones and Chancellor stand in the front, toward the sides of the stage. Keenan often faces the backdrop or the sides of the stage rather than the audience. No followspots or live cameras are used; instead, the band employs extensive backlighting to direct the focus away from the band members and toward large screens in the back and the crowd. Breckinridge Haggerty, the band's live video designer, says that the resulting dark spaces on stage [...] "are mostly for Maynard". He explains, [...] " [...] lot of the songs are a personal journey for him and he has a hard time with the glare of the lights when he's trying to reproduce these emotions for the audience. He needs a bit of personal space, and he feels more comfortable in the shadows." [...] The big screens are used to play back [...] "looped clips that aren't tracked to a song like a music video. The band has never used any sort of timecode. They’ve always made sure the video can change on-the-fly, in a way that can be improvised. ... The show is never the same twice." [...] During the 10,000 Days tour, the video material consisted of over six hours of material, created by Jones, his wife Camella Grace, Chet Zar, Meats Meier, and Haggerty. Some of the material created by Zar has been released on his DVD Disturb the Normal.|$|E
500|$|Rare {{began work}} on Rare Replay in 2014 as a 30th anniversary celebration. The company wanted to do {{something}} unique for what they considered a rare milestone in the industry. Rare was also influenced by community requests to bring their classics to Xbox One, and by the Microsoft backward-compatibility team's progress on the feature. The compilation was one of several celebration ideas, but once it was chosen, the [...] "30 years" [...] theme led to the 30 game limit and [...] price point. As reflective of the company's character and celebratory theme, Rare chose a papercraft art style and theatrical <b>stage</b> <b>setting</b> for the compilation. Rare Replay became part of Rare's plan to simultaneously celebrate its past and introduce its future with a logo redesign, new website, and announcement of their upcoming game, Sea of Thieves. To select the final 30 games, Rare sorted through 120 games in their catalog. They rated each title for fitness and prioritized those that featured characters and environments original to the company, choosing to exclude those based on licensed intellectual properties. Secondarily, Rare considered whether licenses were available and whether a title remained fun and playable by modern standards. They wanted a wide and representative sample of [...] "popular games that would hit that nostalgic beat that everyone likes". Rare chose the Nintendo 64 Conker's Bad Fur Day over the Xbox version (Conker: Live & Reloaded) because they felt the latter had strayed too far from the original. While Rare Replay designers made the final call, other Rare employees and veterans gave input and recollected old game development stories.|$|E
500|$|One of Gilbert's {{most notable}} innovations, first found in Thespis and {{repeated}} in Trial by Jury {{and all of}} the later Savoy operas, is the use of the chorus as {{an essential part of the}} action. [...] In most earlier operas, burlesques, and comedies, the chorus had very little impact on the plot and served mainly as [...] "noise or ornament". [...] In the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, however, the chorus is essential, taking part in the action and often acting as an important character in its own right. [...] Sullivan recalled, [...] "Until Gilbert took the matter in hand choruses were dummy concerns, and were practically nothing more than a part of the <b>stage</b> <b>setting.</b> [...] It was in 'Thespis' that Gilbert began to carry out his expressed determination to get the chorus to play its proper part in the performance. [...] At this moment it seems difficult to realise that the idea of the chorus being anything more than a sort of stage audience was, at that time, a tremendous novelty." [...] Another Gilbert innovation, following the example of his mentor, T. W. Robertson, was that the costumes and sets were made as realistic as possible: [...] Gilbert based the scenery for the production on the Clerkenwell Sessions House, where he had practised law in the 1860s. [...] The costumes were contemporary, and Angelina and her bridesmaids were dressed in real wedding attire. [...] This attention to detail and careful creation of realistic sets and scenes were typical of Gilbert's stage management and would be repeated in all of Gilbert's work. [...] For instance, when preparing the sets for H.M.S. Pinafore (1878), Gilbert and Sullivan visited Portsmouth to inspect ships. [...] Gilbert made sketches of H.M.S. Victory and H.M.S. St Vincent and created a model set for the carpenters to work from. This was far from standard procedure in Victorian drama, where naturalism was still a relatively new concept, and where most authors had very little influence on how their plays and libretti were staged.|$|E

2500|$|Bizarre magic uses mystical, horror, fantasy, {{and other}} similar themes in performance. Bizarre magic is {{typically}} performed in a close-up venue, although some performers have effectively presented it in a <b>stage</b> <b>setting.</b> Charles Cameron has generally been credited as the [...] "godfather of bizarre magic."

2500|$|In the {{earliest}} productions of the Grove Play, several restrictions were imposed upon the Sire (the master of ceremonies) including that the <b>stage</b> <b>setting</b> be the natural forest backdrop {{and that the}} [...] "malign character Care" [...] be introduced in the plot, to wreak havoc with the characters and then be faced down and vanquished by the hero. In these early productions, the Cremation of Care immediately followed, and lasted until midnight. The end of the ceremony was signaled by a lively Jinks Band rendition of There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight, and the club members sat down to a late dinner and revelry.|$|E
2500|$|Two riders ventured clear, as 's Olivier Kaisen and [...] rider Tristan Valentin moved {{ahead of}} the peloton.

Barguil's winning move came with [...] remaining, passing Atapuma to win by twenty seconds. A three-way sprint for fourth place saw Bardet finish just ahead of Froome with Urán placing fifth; Bardet moved up to second overall, six seconds ahead of Urán, with Froome holding a 23 second advantage.

2500|$|On {{the basis}} of circumstantial evidence, it is speculated that the Bridewell Governors may have decided as early as 1598 to allow public {{visitors}} as means of raising hospital income. The only other reference to visiting in the sixteenth-century is provided in a comment in Thomas More's 1522 treatise, The Four Last Things, where he observed that [...] "thou shalt in Bedleem see one laugh at the knocking of his head against a post". As More occupied a variety of official positions that might have occasioned his calling {{to the hospital and}} as he lived nearby, his visit provides no compelling evidence that public visitation was widespread during the sixteenth century. The first apparently definitive documentation of public visiting derives from a 1610 record which details Lord Percy's payment of 10 shillings for the privilege of rambling through the hospital to view its deranged denizens. It was also at this time, and perhaps not coincidentally, that Bedlam was first used as a <b>stage</b> <b>setting</b> with the publication of The Honest Whore, Part I, in 1604.|$|E
2500|$|German {{newspaper}} Volksstimme {{reviewed the}} show in Cologne and {{described it as a}} [...] "Madonna-show in miniature" [...] but noted that the [...] "classic" [...] hits got the greatest acclaim from the audience. Anders Nunstedt from Swedish newspaper Expressen attended the show at Stockholm and declared it as better than The MDNA Tour. Nunstedt complimented how the audience was gradually made interactive and the show became conversational. He also commended the singer's speech regarding the November 2015 Paris attacks and singing [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] as a tribute to the victims and survivors. Andrea Annaratone from Italian Vanity Fair reviewed the shows in Turin and criticized Madonna for starting the concert late. However, he complimented the show and Madonna's camaraderie with the audience. Peter Vantyghem from Belgium's De Standaard reviewed the show at Antwerp. He criticized the music assimilation during the Latin section, but was complimentary about the ending of the show, and the messages surrounding love and positivism. Hester Carvalho from the NRC Handelsblad rated the Amsterdam show 4 stars out of 5, noting that the show gradually became more streamlined but had less synchronized dance moves unlike The MDNA Tour. Carvalho was also impressed by the <b>stage</b> <b>setting</b> and the long catwalk.|$|E
