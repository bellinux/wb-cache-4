50|$|To {{meet this}} {{requirement}} while including internal TV circuitry, the machines {{needed to be}} heavily shielded. Both were built around very strong cast aluminum shields forming a partial Faraday cage, with the various components screwed down onto this internal framework. This {{had the advantage of}} producing an extremely sturdy computer, although at the disadvantage of added manufacturing expense and complexity. The FCC ruling also made it difficult to have any sizable holes in the case, which eliminated expansion slots or cards that communicated with the outside world via their own connectors. Instead, Atari designed the Serial Input/Output (SIO) computer bus, a daisy-chainable system that allowed multiple, auto-configuring devices to connect to the computer through a single <b>shielded</b> <b>connector.</b> The internal slots were reserved for ROM and RAM modules; they did not have the control lines necessary for a fully functional expansion card, nor room to route a cable outside the case to communicate with external devices.|$|E
30|$|The current {{consumption}} of the device powered by the emulator was measured and sampled {{by means of a}} National Instruments PXI- 4071 digital multimeter with a sensitivity down to 1 pA [44] while digital waveforms were sampled by means of a National Instruments NI-DAQmx PCI- 6251 16 -channel data acquisition board connected to a BNC- 2120 <b>shielded</b> <b>connector</b> block [45, 46]. Square waves were produced using a TG 2000 Aim-TTi analogue and digital function generators [47]. During the experiments, the emulator prototype was powered at 12 V by a NGMO 2 Rohde & Schwarz dual-channel power supply [48]. The emulator was tested with constant load by connecting it to simple static resistors while an ad-hoc designed DC electronic load was used in constant current experiments. Finally, more realistic operating conditions have been experimented by using the emulator as a power source for a real VirtualSense sensor node [49].|$|E

The process basically consists of potting wires of a shielded cable between the cable <b>shield</b> and a <b>connector</b> housing to fill in, support, regidize, and insulate the individual wires contained in the cable. The formed potting is coated with an electrically conductive material so as to form an entirely encompassing adhering conductive path between the cable shield and the metallic connector housing.

50|$|M-Modules are {{standardized}} as ANSI/VITA 12-1996 and {{are especially}} suited for adding {{any kind of}} real-world I/O to a system in a flexible way. They are modular I/O extensions {{for all types of}} industrial computers, from embedded systems up to high-end workstations. The M-Module Interface - a fast asynchronous parallel interface - offers sophisticated functions like 32-bit data bus, burst transfers up to 100 MB/s, DMA and trigger capabilities. M-Modules also offer direct front-panel connection rather than requiring a separate adapter panel with ribbon-cable connections. This provides a clean path for sensitive signals without loss of data or signal quality - using, for example, <b>shielded</b> D-Sub <b>connectors</b> and coaxial cables.|$|R
50|$|Figure 4 shows a {{photograph}} of the cross-section of such a device. At one side of this photograph the contours of a high-voltage cable are drawn. Here red represents the conductor of that cable and blue the insulation of the cable. The black parts in this picture are semi-conducting rubber parts. The outer one is at earth potential and spreads the electric field in a similar way as in a cable terminal. The inner one is at high-voltage and <b>shields</b> the <b>connector</b> of the conductors from the electric field. The field itself is diverted as shown in figure 5, where the equipotential lines are smoothly directed from the inside of the cable to the outer part of the bi-manchet (and vice versa at {{the other side of the}} device).|$|R
2500|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of this standard, the wiring of pins 2 and 3 varied. The pin 2 [...] "hot" [...] and pin 3 [...] "cold" [...] convention was typically used by European and Japanese equipment manufacturers, but American companies used pin 3 [...] "hot" [...] and pin 2 [...] "cold". This caused problems when interconnecting equipment with unbalanced connections. The pin 3 [...] "hot" [...] convention is now obsolete but is still found on vintage equipment. Pin 1 has always been ground and/or shield if the cable is <b>shielded,</b> and many <b>connectors</b> connect it internally to the connector shell or case.|$|R
5000|$|Semko 17 were 3/4-pin 3-phase connectors, with (4-pin) {{or without}} (3-pin) a neutral connector. Earth were {{provided}} via the <b>shield.</b> The <b>connectors</b> {{were available in}} different sizes, 16 A with rounded corners; 25 A and 63 A were rectangular. These connectors were used mainly in industrial and agricultural installations. Manufacturing and selling of Semko-17 connectors with metal shells was prohibited in 1989. A few years later manufacturing and selling of all Semko-17 connectors were prohibited. Existing connectors may be used but not by any employee (prohibited by [...] "Arbetsmiljöverket"). The reason for the prohibition is that Semko-17 had several safety issues. The ground connection can become oxidized and when the shells are made of metal any ground fault goes right through {{the hands of a}} person connecting/disconnecting a male and a female cable connector (unless the person wears insulating gloves). Incorrect use of the ground connector as a neutral was not uncommon. Perhaps the worst issue is that in some connectors the ground screw could rust so severely that the ground wire comes loose and in the worst case make contact with a line (phase) wire nearby.|$|R
50|$|A D-sub {{contains}} {{two or more}} parallel rows of pins or sockets usually surrounded by a D-shaped metal shield that provides mechanical support, ensures correct orientation, and may screen against electromagnetic interference. The part containing pin contacts is called the male connector or plug, while that containing socket contacts is called the female connector or socket. The socket's shield fits tightly inside the plug's <b>shield.</b> Panel mounted <b>connectors</b> usually have threaded nuts that accept screws on the cable end connector cover that are used for locking the connectors together and offering mechanical strain relief. Occasionally the nuts may be found on a cable end connector if {{it is expected to}} connect to another cable end (see the male DE-9 pictured). When screened cables are used, the shields are connected to the overall screens of the cables. This creates an electrically continuous screen covering the whole cable and connector system.|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) is introduced. A short {{overview}} of the regulatory EMC requirements in Europe and in the United States is presented. An explanation is given why {{it is important for}} people in the electronics business to understand the need for EMC regulations. Electromagnetic shielding is a often used as an electromagnetic barrier for attenuation of disturbances from radiating sources. An orientation over the concept of electromagnetic barriers is presented. Ways to characterize barriers are presented and measurement methods are reviewed. Results from transfer impedance measurements show that conductive gaskets made of tin coated stainless steel, can give as good shielding performance as gaskets made of beryllium copper in the entire frequency interval of the investigation. The results show that the difference in shielding performance with gaskets made of tin coated stainless steel and of beryllium copper can be insignificant compared to the influence of a very small change in contact pressure. The difference between gaskets with and without tin coating is small with beryllium copper as base material. With stainless steel as base material the difference is about 10 dB at 2 MHz and less at higher frequencies. A method to describe electromagnetic barriers such as filters, <b>shielded</b> cables and <b>connectors</b> etc. with circuits consisting of linear discrete components is presented. By comparing a barrier with a multi-conductor transmission line a lumped circuit can be constructed where component values are designated by the per-unit length transmission line parameters. For barriers that cannot be viewed as transmission lines a method for determining equivalent circuits outgoing from measured S-parameters has been developed. Different measurement fixtures were constructed in order to obtain accurate S-parameter values. Derived models have been used in SPICE simulations and validated by comparison with measurements. The current distributions on the surface of a printed log periodic dipole antenna (LPDA) have been investigated. A position scanned magnetic field probe was used to obtain values of the magnitude and phase of the magnetic field at each point of the scan. From the measurements the time variant instantaneous values of the magnetic field and the instantaneous currents on the LPDA were derived. The wave nature of the current distribution can be readily observed and problems with the design such as standing waves on the feeder lines are highlighted. Measured current distributions are compared with predicted distributions obtained from Method of Moments (MOM) analysis of the LPDA structure. Measured and predicted far field radiation patterns are also compared. Godkänd; 2000; 20070318 (ysko) </p...|$|R
