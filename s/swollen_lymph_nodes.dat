5|$|Chagas disease, {{also known}} as American trypanosomiasis, is a {{tropical}} parasitic disease caused by the protist Trypanosoma cruzi. It is spread mostly by insects known as Triatominae or kissing bugs. The symptoms change {{over the course of}} the infection. In the early stage, symptoms are typically either not present or mild, and may include fever, <b>swollen</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> headaches, or local swelling at the site of the bite. After 8–12 weeks, individuals enter the chronic phase of disease and in 60–70% it never produces further symptoms. The other 30 to 40% of people develop further symptoms 10 to 30 years after the initial infection, including enlargement of the ventricles of the heart in 20 to 30%, leading to heart failure. An enlarged esophagus or an enlarged colon may also occur in 10% of people.|$|E
5|$|Herpes simplex is a {{viral disease}} {{caused by the}} herpes simplex virus. Infections are {{categorized}} based {{on the part of the}} body infected. Oral herpes involves the face or mouth. It may result in small blisters in groups often called cold sores or fever blisters or may just cause a sore throat. Genital herpes, often simply known as herpes, may have minimal symptoms or form blisters that break open and result in small ulcers. These typically heal over two to four weeks. Tingling or shooting pains may occur before the blisters appear. Herpes cycles between periods of active disease followed by periods without symptoms. The first episode is often more severe and may be associated with fever, muscle pains, <b>swollen</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and headaches. Over time, episodes of active disease decrease in frequency and severity. Other disorders caused by herpes simplex include: herpetic whitlow when it involves the fingers, herpes of the eye, herpes infection of the brain, and neonatal herpes when it affects a newborn, among others.|$|E

25|$|Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE), also {{known simply as}} lupus, is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue {{in many parts of}} the body. Symptoms vary between people and may be mild to severe. Common symptoms include painful and swollen joints, fever, chest pain, hair loss, mouth ulcers, <b>swollen</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> feeling tired, and a red rash which is most commonly on the face. Often there are periods of illness, called flares, and periods of remission during which there are few symptoms.|$|E
25|$|African trypanosomiasis {{symptoms}} {{occur in}} two stages. The first stage, {{known as the}} hemolymphatic phase, is characterized by fever, headaches, joint pains, and itching. Fever is intermittent, with attacks lasting from a day to a week, separated by intervals of {{a few days to}} a month or longer. Invasion of the circulatory and lymphatic systems by the parasites is associated with severe swelling of lymph nodes, often to tremendous sizes. Winterbottom's sign, the tell-tale <b>swollen</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> along the back of the neck, may appear. Occasionally, a chancre (red sore) will develop at the location of the tsetse fly bite. If left untreated, the disease overcomes the host's defenses and can cause more extensive damage, broadening symptoms to include anemia, endocrine, cardiac, and kidney dysfunctions.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} of an enlarged spleen, and swollen posterior cervical, axillary, and inguinal <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> are the most useful to suspect a diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis. On the other hand, the absence of <b>swollen</b> cervical <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> and fatigue are the most useful to dismiss the idea of infectious mononucleosis as the correct diagnosis. The insensitivity of the physical examination in detecting an enlarged spleen means {{it should not be}} used as evidence against infectious mononucleosis. A physical examination may also show petechiae in the palate.|$|R
40|$|A 69 -year-old man was {{referred}} to our hospital in December 1993 because an abnormal mass hadbeendetected inthe rightpulmonary hilum. Computed tomography (CT) ofthechestrevealed a <b>swollen</b> hilar <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> between the right middle and lower lobe bronchi, and an adherent tumor in the rightventrobasal segment (S 8). Chest roentgenogram in February 1994, however, showed no evident tumor in the right lung field. In March 1996, the mass in the rightpulmonary hilum reappeared on chest roentgenogram. Chest CT revealed a <b>swollen</b> hilar <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> between the right middle and lowerlobebronchi, {{but there was no}} tumor in right S 8. The patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopy on 17 May 1996. Intraoperative needle biopsy of the node revealed cancercells. We performed right middle and lowerbilobectomy with mediastinal dissection. Histological diagnosis revealed a large cell carcinoma almostcompletely occupying a hilar <b>lymph</b> <b>node.</b> The resected middle and lower lobes showed no tumors, except for a coagulation necrosis measuring 1. 5 cm in diameter in S 8 b, corresponding to the site where a tumor shadow had been depicted on the CT image in December 1993.

40|$|Abstract. This is a {{case report}} of a gastro-lymphatic fistula which {{appeared}} during chemoradiotherapy for advanced esophageal cancer. A 60 -year-old male was referred to the University of the Ryukyus Hospital because of a 10 kg monthly weight loss and dysphagia. Computed tomography (CT) scans indicated thickened esophageal wall at the lower thoracic esophagus and a <b>swollen</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> attached to the lesser curvature of the stomach. Histological analysis of the biopsy specimen revealed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and the diagnosis was of advanced esophageal cancer. A combination of chemotherapy (nedaplatin and 5 -fluorouracil) and radiotherapy was initiated. After radiotherapy (20 Gy), CT scans revealed that the <b>swollen</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> penetrated the gastric wall resulting in a gastro-lymphatic fistula. Although gastrostomy and intestinal fistula repair were performed for gastric decompression and tube feeding, respectively, the patient’s general status did not improve and he died two months after interruption of his chemoradiotherapy. The results indicate {{that there may be}} some risks of gastro-lymphatic fistula in patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy for advanced esophageal cancer when there are possible signs of involvement by CT scans. Esophageal carcinoma has proven {{one of the most difficult}} malignancies to cure, and locally advanced esophageal carcinoma is often refractory to current therapeutic approaches and has poor outcomes (1 - 4). Recently, in patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer, it has been shown that local control and overall survival can be significantly improved with concurrent chemoradiotherapy compared with radiotherapy alone (5, 6). However, in patients with advanced esophageal or pulmonary malignancies, formation of an esophagorespiratory (ER) fistula, including esophagotracheal and esophagobronchial fistula, has been a serious complication associated with a dismal prognosis (7, 8). If a malignant ER fistula is left untreated, the patient soon develops pulmonary infection and sepsis, with a median survival time from diagnosis of 1 to 6 weeks (7, 8). Although complications such as esophago-bronchial (9) and esophago-mediastinal (10, 11) fistula have been reported, there have been no reports of patients with gastro-lymphatic fistula. In this paper, a case of gastro-lymphatic fistula which appeared during chemoradiotherapy for advanced esophageal cancer is reported...|$|R
25|$|Rask {{apparently}} {{suffered from}} symptoms of Pre-AIDS starting in late 1974, including diarrhea, <b>swollen</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> weight loss, and fatigue. Although the symptoms receded temporarily following drug treatments in 1975, the symptoms later grew considerably worse. Following {{a vacation in}} South Africa in July 1977, {{she could no longer}} breathe and relied on bottled oxygen. She flew back to Denmark, where tests at Copenhagen's Rigshospitalet discovered she had contracted a number of opportunistic infections, such as Staphylococcus aureus (staph infection), candidiasis (yeast infection), and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP, a fungal infection of the lungs formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia). Tests also showed that Rask had a nearly non-existent T-cell count, leading to a severely depressed immune system. At the time, the doctors treating Rask were at a loss to explain her disease progression, which in retrospect, would come to be seen {{as one of the first}} cases of AIDS recorded outside Africa.|$|E
25|$|Rubella, {{also known}} as German measles or three-day measles, is an {{infection}} caused by the rubella virus. This disease is often mild with half of people not realizing that they are sick. A rash may start around two weeks after exposure and last for three days. It usually starts on the face and spreads {{to the rest of}} the body. The rash is not as bright as that of measles and is sometimes itchy. <b>Swollen</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> are common and may last a few weeks. A fever, sore throat, and fatigue may also occur. In adults joint pain is common. Complications may include bleeding problems, testicular swelling, and inflammation of nerves. Infection during early pregnancy may result in a child born with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) or miscarriage. Symptoms of CRS include problems with the eyes such as cataracts, ears such as deafness, heart, and brain. Problems are rare after the 20th week of pregnancy.|$|E
