40|$|A rapid {{method was}} used to {{identify}} kinetics of the recrystallization for two IF (Interstitial Free) steels which have different phosphorous and boron contents. The static and metadynamic softening behaviour of the materials {{for a range of}} strain rates and temperatures were quantified. The critical strain for initiation of strain independent softening was estimated for the IF steels in respect to the time for 50 percent softening after deformation. The results showed that the strain for the initiation of strain independent softening (often referred to as metadynamic recrystallization) varies with the Zener Hollomon parameter. Classic static recrystallization was observed at strains below the strain independent softening for all processing conditions and the strain rate had a strong effect on the time for strain independent softening. Results also revealed that static and metadynamic recrystallization was delayed owing to the phosphorous and boron alloying elements.

By using the second-development method based on the commercial code thermal behavior and temperature distribution of strips through seven-pass finishing rolling are described in detail. A method for computing the mean temperature at the exit of each pass is approached. Using this method the mean temperature can be attained after each pass. In one seven-pass thin <b>strip</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>mills</b> the temperature at the exit after each pass is measured by the pyrometer. The measured results and the simulation results are compared.

40|$|The early fault {{characteristics}} of rolling element bearings carried by vibration signals are quite weak because the signals are generally masked by heavy background noise.

The proposed method combines {{the ability of}} MCKD in indicating the periodic fault transients {{and the ability of}} SK in locating these transients in the frequency domain.

Through analyzing actual vibration signals collected from wind turbines and hot <b>strip</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>mills,</b> we confirm that by using the proposed method, it is possible to extract fault characteristics and diagnose early faults of rolling element bearings.

40|$|International audienceIntense {{competition}} in steel market {{has led to}} the development of a number of high strength steel grades processed through hot <b>strip</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>mills.</b> These steels pose new serious challenges in manufacturing. One of the major challenges lies in the control of strip cooling after finishing hot rolling, which has become a key step in delivering products with desired microstructure and mechanical properties. To meet this need, ArcelorMittal R&D has developed SimROT, a dynamic run out table strip cooling control system. Based on a coupling between physical principle based thermal and metallurgical models, SimROT is able to predict temperature and mechanical property accurately over a wide range of products, including plain low, mid and high carbon steels as well as high alloy steels. In addition, adaptation logic has been developed to compensate for un-modeled dynamics in different parts of the strip and a model-based in-bar feed-forward / feedback controller has been designed to achieve aimed coiling temperature under various process disturbances.

40|$|Thermal fatigue {{represents}} {{one of the most significant}} causes for roughing mill roll deterioration and possible failure. The materials ability to withstand thermal cycling is strictly correlated to its microstructural properties, which are the result of the solidification process and following heat treatment. Rolls for hot <b>strip</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>mills</b> are usually produced by centrifugal casting, without subsequent forging. A crucial role is played by the eutectic carbide network developing on solidification, which represents a preferential pattern for crack propagation. For this reason conventional highly alloyed HSS are not a popular substitute for traditional Chromium steel rolls in rougher stands. The so- called “semi-HSS”, containing less C (0. 7 - 0. 9 %C) and alloying elements are usually preferred by users requiring improved roll material. Specially developed “HSS for roughers ” are being tested in various mills, but they are out of the scope of this paper. The present work is part of a continuing effort by INNSE Cilindri (RIVA Group) and Trento University to improve the “semi HSS ” grades. In particular the thermal fatigue resistance of a new class of low-C semi HSS is evaluated. For purpose of comparison, both a conventional semi-HSS and a HSS grade were also considered. The test is based on induction heating (Tmax= 670 °C) and water cooling of cylindrical discs. Experimental results confirm the lower susceptibility towards heat checking of the new grades, containing reduced amount of eutectic carbides, the best behaviour being exhibited by a steel with a mixed martensite-bainite matrix microstructure.
