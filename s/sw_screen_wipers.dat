50|$|In 1959, the IMS-57 was {{replaced}} by M59, which was a substantial improvement over its predecessor. Launched two years later, the new type M59 signified a step forward compared to IMS-57: its engine had , a maximum speed enhanced to 90 km/h, the manual wind <b>screen</b> <b>wiper</b> replaced with an electric one. The cars were bodyworked (2 doors, 4 doors or pick-up), painted and finished in Câmpulung. During the four years in production (1959-1963) the number of vehicles built jumped from 803 (1959) to 3,222 (1963).|$|R
40|$|A Tracking Laser Doppler Vibrometer (TLDV) {{measurement}} {{system has been}} developed for measuring vibration of point on an arbitrarily moving objects using Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV) with tracking feature. Two tracking strategies were developed {{in order to measure}} in-plane and out-of-plane vibration of <b>screen</b> <b>wiper</b> arm. The systems are based on an open loop control system working with information provided by a digital encoder or, alternatively, by wire potentiometer(s) used to determine the position of the object tracked. Examples of vibration measurements on two different type of windscreen wipers are included. 1...|$|R
40|$|Direct current {{motors and}} {{stepping}} motors are very {{often used for}} electric drives in cars. The most frequent representatives of direct current motors are electric starter and wind- <b>screen</b> <b>wiper</b> motor. Stepping motors are very often used for electric regulating of outsides driving mirrors and seats. This study is focused on innovation and DC permanent magnet motor. The disadvanage of direct current motors is so called „sliding contact“. A possible compensation of direct current motor are EC (electronically commutator) motors that do not need sliding contact for their work...|$|R
40|$|Electric drives used in {{automotive}} industry are {{often based on}} standard DC motor as it is widely recognised as mature and reliable technology. The most common applications of DC motors in {{automotive industry}} are starters and wind <b>screen</b> <b>wiper</b> motors. Aim of this thesis is to provide design overview of typical automotive DC motor therefore main parts and features of the machine will be described in detail. Main disadvantage of DC motor is „sliding contact“ between commutator and carbon brushes which introduces source of electromagnetic disturbance and requires regular maintenance. Within this project different aspects of DC motor design and innovation {{are expected to be}} tackled including examples of loss calculation...|$|R
5000|$|Introduced on November 7, 1996, {{the fifth}} {{generation}} retained an FF layout with an {{independent front suspension}} and 63/37 weight distribution. Most fifth-generation Honda Preludes came with 16 in aluminium alloy wheels with all-season 205/50 R16 87V tires. Most fifth-generation models featured the 11.1" [...] front brakes like the '96 VTEC model, and most Preludes also received a five-lug hub (not the four-lug wheel hub of older models). The Prelude was only available in three models for Canada and two models for the US (the Base and Type SH); Canada's market included the SE as well. All models came with 16-inch alloy wheels and [...] The 2.0i and JDM Si trims came with 195/60 R15 88H, and the JDM Xi came with 14" [...] steel wheels. Unlike the US market Preludes, JDM Preludes came with rear wind <b>screen</b> <b>wipers,</b> except for the Xi.|$|R
5000|$|Recall code RJ-1122-1: Between 3rd Oct 1994 to 3rd Mar 1995 - on 1,251 DE2A models (chassis numbers 0000008 to 0001566) and 11,816 DE3A models (chassis numbers 0000025 to 0013017) - {{a section}} of wiring in the loom {{relating}} to idle speed control (aka 'stepper motor') was too short, resulting in fracture disconnection of wires at the motor due to long-term engine vibration.(The older stepper motor unit itself also has/had a brown/khaki color plastic unit. Replacements are black plastic).Recall code RJ-1122-2: For the same dates and models in recall above, the bracket securing the glovebox had insufficient space to a wiring loom, possibly causing interference to the wiring due to long-term vibration. Symptoms being a blown fuse, starting failure and/or failing <b>screen</b> <b>wiper</b> operation.This affected 1,305 of those DE2A models and 12,375 of the DE3A models.Both recall instances and corrected models (18th Jun 2004) have a white or yellow paint 'dot' on the bottom bolt head of the passenger door lower hinge.|$|R
5000|$|The body {{design was}} anachronistic. A {{journalist}} {{old enough to}} remember the pre-war Dolomite Roadster that had inspired the car felt that the elegant proportions of the earlier model had been abandoned in favour of a committee-based compromise, [...] "a plump Christmas turkey to set against that dainty peacock ... more Toadster Roadster". The front had large separate headlamps and the radiator was well back from the front between large [...] "coal scuttle" [...] wings. Passenger accommodation was on a bench seat that was claimed to seat three: the car's 64 inch width helped make a reality of the three-abreast seating, and the approach meant a column gear change was required. The car's unusual width also made it necessary to fit three <b>screen</b> <b>wipers</b> in a row, an example followed by early shallow windscreen Jaguar E Types. Additional room for two was provided at the rear in a dickey seat with its own folding windscreen: this was outside the hood that could be erected to cover the front seat. Entry and exit to the dickey seat was never easy and a step was provided on the rear bumper. The Roadster was the last production car with a dickey seat.|$|R
40|$|Abstract In this paper, we {{describe}} HW and SW {{features of the}} developed prototype of a hybrid 3 G mobile phone and wireless terminal, which provides integral video projection onto two VGA/ 2 displays that, when put side-by-side, form the integrated display with {{the ratio of the}} overall width to its overall height, equal to 4 : 3, so providing the integral video VGA format and enabling visual presentation of standard full-size web pages, PC mainstream <b>SW</b> <b>screens</b> (such as e. g. the ones of e-mail clients), multi-media content etc. When not in use, the displays can be fold back one onto each other, so preserving the industry-standard dimensions of the device. The two displays that share the image provide it with overall resolution of 640 x 480 pixels per inch. The device is driven by Texas Instruments OMAP 2420 multimedia pro-cessor with ARM 1136 core and Linux operating system. In addition, the device is equipped with specially developped prototypes of unique spring/microgenerator-based battery charger as well as with ultra-thin mountable foil-based QWERTY keyboard...|$|R
40|$|The {{transcription}} factor SOX 9 {{is important in}} maintaining the chondrocyte phenotype. To identify novel genes regulated by SOX 9 we investigated changes in gene expression by microarray analysis following retroviral transduction with SOX 9 of a human chondrocytic cell line (SW 1353). From the results {{the expression of a}} group of genes (SRPX, S 100 A 1, APOD, RGC 32, CRTL 1, MYBPH, CRLF 1 and SPINT 1) was evaluated further in human articular chondrocytes (HACs). First, the same genes were investigated in primary cultures of HACs following SOX 9 transduction, and four were found to be similarly regulated (SRPX, APOD, CRTL 1 and S 100 A 1). Second, during dedifferentiation of HACs by passage in monolayer cell culture, during which the expression of SOX 9 progressively decreased, four of the genes (S 100 A 1, RGC 32, CRTL 1 and SPINT 1) also decreased in their expression. Third, in samples of osteoarthritic (OA) cartilage, which had decreased SOX 9 expression compared with age-matched controls, there was decreased expression of SRPX, APOD, RGC 32, CRTL 1 and SPINT 1. The results showed that a group of genes identified as being upregulated by SOX 9 in the initial <b>SW</b> 1353 <b>screen</b> were also regulated in expression in healthy and OA cartilage. Other genes initially identified were differently expressed in isolated OA chondrocytes and their expression was unrelated to changes in SOX 9. The results thus identified some genes whose expression appeared to be linked to SOX 9 expression in isolated chondrocytes and were also altered during cartilage degeneration in osteoarthritis...|$|R
40|$|Population genetic {{studies on}} {{white sea bream}} Diplodus sargus have {{revealed}} different patterns in the subdivision of populations in the Mediterranean Sea. However, the stability of observed allele frequencies over time remains poorly tested. The {{aim of this study}} was to show that the genetic structure of D. sargus could significantly change over time by analysing temporal variations in allozymes. In order to determine temporal variation in the genetic structure of 5 natural D. sargus populations in the <b>SW</b> Mediterranean, we <b>screened</b> 14 allozyme loci. Our main finding was the significant genotypic differentiation among cohorts (year-classes) in the Guardamar (FST = 0. 012; p < 0. 001) and Cape of Palos (FST = 0. 008; p < 0. 001) populations. The differentiation observed in the present study when considering pair-wise comparisons between cohorts is similar to that of all populations throughout the Mediterranean Sea. Our results suggest that microgeographical variations, also known as ‘chaotic genetic patchiness’, could occur in D. sargus populations from the SW Mediterranean. The recruitment of genetically variable cohorts at 1 site each year may account for these variations. We also discussed alternative explanations for this genetic pattern. This study confirms the importance of understanding the ecology, behaviour and environment of fish populations when investigating population genetic structure. Our results also highlight the importance of incorporating temporal samples when conducting population structure studies. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
