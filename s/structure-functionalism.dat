Together with {{many of his colleagues}} at the Rhodes-Livingstone Institute and students at Manchester University, collectively known as the Manchester School, took BSA in new directions through their introduction of explicitly Marxist-informed theory, their emphasis on conflicts and conflict resolution, and their attention {{to the ways in which}} individuals negotiate and make use of the social structural possibilities. During this period Gluckman was also involved in a dispute with American anthropologist Paul Bohannan on ethnographic methodology within the anthropological study of law. He believed that indigenous terms used in ethnographic data should be translated into Anglo-American legal terms for the benefit of the reader. The Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth was founded in 1946.|$|E
5000|$|Lawrence's {{early work}} was, in the British tradition, an {{examination}} of Garia social structure. However, Lawrence's portrayal of Garia social structure was by anthropologists of the day because the picture he painted differed so greatly from orthodox models of the time. Lawrence published ethnographic accounts of Garia life in Land Tenure Among The Garia: The Traditional System of a New Guinea People (1955) and (in roughly similar form) Studies in New Guinea Land Tenure (1967, which included work by Ian Hogbin as well). It was not until 1984 that Lawrence finally published Garia: An Ethnography of a Traditional Cosmic System in Papua New Guinea. At that point, the academic community recognized that Lawrence's account of the Garia was not just accurate, but years ahead of its time. In the end, Lawrence's careful ethnography was vindicated and the earlier models that he challenged were recognized to be inaccurate. In 1967 he published a long, satirical poem entitled [...] "Don Juan in Melanesia" [...] mocking the <b>structure-functionalism</b> that he opposed.|$|E
40|$|This thesis has {{two main}} aims: first, to {{demonstrate}} how a particular social theory, <b>Structure-Functionalism,</b> can be adapted {{for the purpose of}} investigating the problems and processes of organisational evolution; and second, to document and to analyse the creation and evolution of New Zealand's first Community College. The work of Talcott Parsons is taken as the theoretical foundation for this documentation and analysis. The thesis is divided into two main parts. The first deals with theory and method while the second part presents the findings of a case study focussing on the Hawke's Bay Community College. The findings from the case study suggest that the Hawke's Bay Community College, rather than becoming a radically new-type of educational organisation, was evolving as a variant of an existing organisational form, namely, the small technical institute. The thesis concludes with an explanation of this evolutionary pattern and discussion of theoretical and methodological conclusions...|$|E

These developments make possible a theoretical synthesis of social network theory in relation to understanding social dynamics. The past 35 years, initially spurred by anthropologist Clyde Mitchell and sociologist Harrison White, saw a massive development of concepts and tools for network analysis and burgeoning applications to everwider sets of problems in the social sciences. The trajectories of social network analysis in the two disciplines were very different, however. In anthropology, where it {{was introduced in the}} 1960 s as a collateral tool to institutional and cultural analysis, the network paradigm did not become a central contributor to theory, as in sociology. 1 Still, even in sociology, the development of methodology (Wasserman and Faust 1994) has far outstripped that of an integrated theory of networks that situates explanatory principles in a common conceptual framework. The lack of such developments is notable in both disciplines. In the past decade, however, developments that foster the study of network dynamics have provided more general explanatory frameworks in an emergent network theory. This framework is particularly important in the context of long-term field research in anthropology (Kemper and Royce 2002). I will focus here on applications used 1 Unlike sociology, which defined and forged ahead with social networks as a theoretical paradigm (Mullins 1975, Berkowitz 1982, Burt 1982) on a par with &quot;heavy-duty approaches such as <b>structure-functionalism,</b> Marxism, and ethnomethodology” (Wellman 2000 : 4), interest in networks largely died out in anthropology once those experimenting with the approach in the 1960 s and early 1970 s turned from problems of fluid social structure to the study of transactions, ritual enactment, symbolic action, and contemporary themes of cultural anthropology. Anthropologists with a cognitive focus narrowed their studies to the shared components of egocentric cognitive constructions in relation to observed behavior, studies that unfortunately didn’t recapture the interests of the field at large...|$|E

Turner inherited the three-stage analytical framework from van Gennep, which was further abstracted into structure-antistructure-structure processes. In Turner's view, before the separation phase begins social members are connected by a web of fixed social relationships. The daily norms of behavior control the behavior of people, and the social structure is in a stable state. The separation phase separates the ritual object from the previous society and takes him into the marginal phase. At marginal phase the ritual object is freed from the structure of society. His social position is unclear, and he can do something in violation of the daily standard, and the stable social structure is destroyed. Turner views this phase as antistructure, before it can be seen as structure. Finally, in the incorporation phase the ritual objects return to society. They establish new social relations with other members of society, daily norms are reaffirmed, and the society returns to a stable state. Turner argues that the marginal phase is {{the most important}} of the three stages, and is usually the longest part in the rite of passage because society needs {{to take advantage of this}} phase to break the original state of society and rebuild a new social relationship and structure. This is a dynamic process. Signs and symbols representing different social relations emerge unceasingly, showing their own strengths and becoming the arena of social relations with the final winner bringing people back to a new static structure (Turner 1969). Turner notes that the seemingly disruptive edge of society is ultimately a tool for society to strengthen its solidarity. For people who participate in transitional rituals such as pilgrimage, social differences between individuals and ranks will disappear in the edge phase and full equality between individuals will form a strong sense of mutual acceptance, creating a community without differences. The community will continue to exist after the stage of incorporation and social solidarity will be greatly strengthened (Turner 1969). We can see that after Turner's extension the rite of passage has the function of strengthening social cohesion, which is consistent with the main point of religion in Durkheim's Les formes élémentaires de la vie religieuse (Durkheim 1912). Ironically, though van Gennep was regarded as Durkheim’s rival and pushed aside in his lifetime, through the efforts of Gluckman et al. his points have been integrated into the <b>structure-functionalism</b> (Turner 1974).|$|E
