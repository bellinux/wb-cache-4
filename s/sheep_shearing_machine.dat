50|$|In 1893 Stewart & Clark {{founded the}} Chicago Flexible Shaft Company (incorporated 1897) to {{manufacture}} flexible driveshafts and mechanical <b>sheep</b> <b>shears.</b> Stewart and Charles Timson of Wm. Cooper & Nephews partnered in founding the Cooper-Stewart <b>Sheep</b> <b>Shearing</b> Machinery Co in 1896 {{and sold the}} <b>sheep</b> <b>shearing</b> products through this new company.|$|R
50|$|After Austin {{spent three}} months {{improving}} the sheep-shearing machine, {{he was asked}} to join The Wolseley <b>Sheep</b> <b>Shearing</b> <b>Machine</b> Company, in Sydney. Shortly after joining, he was sent to a sheep station at Avoca, Victoria to study the machines in use. Austin patented in his own name the improvements he made to the sheep-shearing machines and later sold the patents to the Wolseley <b>Sheep</b> <b>Shearing</b> <b>Machine</b> Company on 10 March 1893 in exchange for shares.|$|E
50|$|The Wolseley <b>Sheep</b> <b>Shearing</b> <b>Machine</b> Company Limited. was a London-incorporated public listed company {{created to}} {{capitalize}} on a business established by Frederick Wolseley in Australia.|$|E
50|$|During 1887, Herbert Austin joined, {{as chief}} engineer, Wolseley <b>Sheep</b> <b>Shearing</b> <b>Machine</b> Company Limited, {{incorporated}} in Sydney, {{a new business}} linked to R G Parks & Co, to make Wolseley's machinery in his workshops at Goldsbrough Mort & Co. Ltd Melbourne. This company was wound up in 1889 and ownership transferred to a new British company, The Wolseley <b>Sheep</b> <b>Shearing</b> <b>Machine</b> Company incorporated in London with a capital of £200,000. Operations remained in Australia, Austin studied the machinery while it was in use on sheep stations and made further patented improvements. Meanwhile Wolseley again visited England leaving Austin in charge.|$|E
50|$|By 1915, {{most large}} Australian <b>sheep</b> station <b>shearing</b> sheds had <b>machines</b> that were powered by steam engines. Later, {{internal}} combustion engines powered machines until rural power supplies became available.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sheep</b> <b>shearing</b> {{and wool}} {{handling}} competitions are held regularly {{in parts of}} the world, particularly Ireland, the UK, South Africa, New Zealand and Australia. As <b>sheep</b> <b>shearing</b> is an arduous task, speed shearers, for all types of equipment and sheep, are usually very fit and well trained. In Wales a <b>sheep</b> <b>shearing</b> contest is one of the events of the Royal Welsh Show, the country's premier agricultural show held near Builth Wells.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sheep</b> <b>shearing</b> also {{features}} in Basque rural sports and works along similar lines as other <b>sheep</b> <b>shearing</b> contests. Ardi ile moztea translates as [...] "the <b>shearing</b> of <b>sheep's</b> wool" [...] {{and it is}} also known as ardi moztea [...] "sheep shearing".|$|R
50|$|Austin {{continued}} {{to be involved with}} the Wolseley <b>Sheep</b> <b>Shearing</b> <b>Machine</b> Company Limited and its sheep shearing machines and other agricultural equipment. He was Chairman of the Board from 1911 to 1933 when he was approaching 70.|$|E
50|$|Looking {{for other}} {{products}} to even out the workload, Herbert Austin {{became interested in}} motor cars and built {{two different types of}} three-wheelers in his own time. A version of one of these was taken up by the Wolseley <b>Sheep</b> <b>Shearing</b> <b>Machine</b> Company and listed for sale in 1900, but the Wolseley board could see no profitable future for a motor industry. In 1901 Vickers bought Wolseley's car interests, taking Austin too, and naming the new business Wolseley Tool & Motor Company setting it up in Adderley Park, Birmingham. Herbert Austin retained his interest and ties with The Wolseley <b>Sheep</b> <b>Shearing</b> <b>Machine</b> Company. He was chairman of their board from 1911 to 1933, when he retired not long before his death.|$|E
50|$|Further {{diversification}} {{occurred in}} 1901 with {{the purchase of}} Herbert Austin's embryo car manufacturing plans, and Austin himself, from The Wolseley <b>Sheep</b> <b>Shearing</b> <b>Machine</b> Company. The new business was incorporated and named The Wolseley Tool and Motor Car Company and works were purchased at Adderley Park.|$|E
5000|$|The {{park has}} a Live <b>Sheep</b> <b>Shearing</b> {{exhibition}} run {{at various times}} of the day called [...] "The Stockman's Camp" [...] it gives patrons the experience of a stock camp on an outback station.

50|$|On 2 March 2007, Broomehill shearer Brendan Boyle set {{the world}} 24-hour <b>sheep</b> <b>{{shearing}}</b> record by shearing 841 full wool Merino sheep, {{and in the}} process raised over $20,000 for the fight against prostate cancer. It was the first time a record has been set in 24 hours <b>sheep</b> <b>shearing.</b> However, for the record to be officially recognized, it needs to be overseen by the World <b>Sheep</b> <b>Shearing</b> Records Committee. This committee has a set of rules, and official referees in three member countries for the specific purpose of ensuring records are set under the same rules and consistent referees in these countries.|$|R
50|$|The vendors (The Wolseley <b>Sheep</b> <b>Shearing</b> <b>Machine</b> Company Limited of Sydney) {{who are the}} {{promoters}} of this company have fixed the {{price to be paid}} for all the patent rights and trade mark obtained and applied for at £75,000 cash and 13,332 fully paid deferred shares of the Company.|$|E
50|$|Caldwell died in 1868. About that time, Wolseley {{set to work}} {{developing}} {{his ideas}} for a <b>sheep</b> <b>shearing</b> <b>machine.</b> By 1872, he had created a working model. He returned from a visit to England and Ireland in 1874 and continued development in Melbourne with Richard Park & Co, an engineering business where {{a few years later}} Herbert Austin, a new immigrant from England, was to serve an apprenticeship. Austin's uncle was works manager.|$|E
50|$|Ruston built oil {{and diesel}} engines in sizes {{from a few}} HP up to large {{industrial}} engines. Several R&H engines are {{on display at the}} Anson Engine Museum at Poynton nr Manchester. Also at Internal Fire - Museum of Power, Tanygroes near Cardigan. The company also diversified into the manufacture of petrol engines, again from around 1.5 hp upwards, some of these designs were later manufactured under licence by The Wolseley <b>Sheep</b> <b>Shearing</b> <b>Machine</b> Company.|$|E

50|$|The early British {{vehicles}} {{of the late}} 19th century relied mainly upon developments from Germany and France. By 1900 however, the first all-British 4-wheel car had been designed and built by Herbert Austin as manager of The Wolseley <b>Sheep</b> <b>Shearing</b> <b>Machine</b> Company. In 1901, backed by (Vickers Limited) brothers 'Colonel Tom' and Albert Vickers, Austin started what became Wolseley Motors Limited in Birmingham and UK's largest car manufacturer until Ford in 1913.|$|E
50|$|Australia and New Zealand had {{to discard}} the old methods of wool {{harvesting}} and evolve more efficient systems {{to cope with}} the huge numbers of sheep involved. Shearing was revolutionized by the invention of an Australian sheepgrower, Frederick York Wolseley. His machines made in Birmingham England by his business The Wolseley <b>Sheep</b> <b>Shearing</b> <b>Machine</b> Company were introduced after 1888, reducing second cuts and shearing time. By 1915 most large sheep station sheds in Australia had installed machines, driven by steam or later by internal combustion engines.|$|E
50|$|Wolseley plc was {{incorporated}} in London in 1887 as a listed public {{company with the}} name The Wolseley <b>Sheep</b> <b>Shearing</b> <b>Machine</b> Company Limited to fund and exploit the commercial potential of the sheep shearing machinery invented by Frederick York Wolseley (1837-1899). Its board of directors {{were among the most}} prominent businessmen of Australia and the size of its capitalization placed it among the more important new issues of that year. From the beginning because machinery sales were highly seasonal efforts were made to diversify operations beyond the sheep shearing machinery. Wolseley with his Australian pastoral interests resigned because of ill-health in 1894.|$|E

50|$|His first <b>sheep</b> <b>shearing</b> {{machinery}} {{was driven}} by horse power replaced later by stationary engines. Following wide demonstrations in eastern Australia and New Zealand in 1887-1888, a woolshed in Louth, N.S.W., was set up with the machinery {{and was the first}} to complete a <b>shearing</b> with the <b>machines.</b> Eighteen more woolsheds were equipped with Wolseley's invention in 1888. The Australian incorporation was wound up and the business's ownership transferred to the new London company in 1889 but operations were retained in Australia.|$|R
5000|$|Shaun the Sheep's first {{appearance}} was in Wallace & Gromit's third short feature, the Academy Award winning A Close Shave, {{as the youngest}} member of a flock of sheep Wallace and Gromit work to save from being turned into dog food. He was named Shaun as a pun on the word [...] "shorn" [...] after he was accidentally subjected to Wallace's automated <b>sheep</b> <b>shearing</b> <b>machine.</b> This early version of Shaun shows a hint of his characteristic human-like bravado—among other things, wearing a sweater knitted from his own shorn wool—and he proves to be a major help in saving the day.|$|E
50|$|The Wolseley Tool and Motor Car Company of Adderley Park Birmingham was {{incorporated}} in March 1901 {{with a capital}} of £40,000 by Vickers, Sons and Maxim to manufacture motor cars and machine tools. The managing director was Herbert Austin. The cars and the Wolseley name came from Austin's exploratory venture for The Wolseley <b>Sheep</b> <b>Shearing</b> <b>Machine</b> Company Limited, run since the early 1890s by the now 33-year-old Austin. Wolseley's board {{had decided not to}} enter the business and Maxim and the Vickers brothers picked it up. After his five-year contract with The Wolseley Tool and Motor Car Company ended Austin founded The Austin Motor Company Limited.|$|E
50|$|There is a Wolseley brand two-stand {{portable}} shearing {{plant in}} the collection of the National Museum of Australia in Canberra. Manufactured in Birmingham, England, around 1930, the shearing plant is powered by a 32-volt, three horse-power single-cylinder petrol engine, mounted on a wooden trolley base with four cast iron wheels. The plant incorporated a revolutionary mechanised shearing handpiece, one of which is also in the museum's collection. The engine is painted green and inscribed with the brand name Wolseley, and has a metal manufacturer's plate which reads: Wolseley <b>Sheep</b> <b>Shearing</b> <b>Machine</b> Company Ltd Birmingham England. The plant, weighing 550 kg, was used on a sheep property named 'Emoh Ruo' in the Rockley-Black Springs area of New South Wales. It was used by Roy and George Keogh between 1948 and 1976.|$|E
