2500|$|Dracula {{appears at}} the end of Tom Lehrer's song [...] "L-Y" [...] from The Electric Company [...] "You enter a very dark room, and <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gloom...is DRACULA! Now how do you say goodbye?/Immediately, Immediately, Immediate L-Y! Bye-Bye!" ...|$|E
60|$|Looking {{back from}} the turning, Felix saw him still <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of the empty street.|$|E
60|$|Blinky was <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> starlight {{holding the}} girl in his arms. His head was bowed over her wan face.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{better come}} in," [...] said Hiram. [...] "It's no good <b>standing</b> out <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cold." [...] He stood aside {{and the girl}} entered, swiftly, gratefully.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{perhaps he}} doesn't," [...] said Lanigan; [...] "but if I were you, Mrs. Petter, I {{would take him}} out a shawl or {{something}} to put over his shoulders. He oughtn't to be <b>standing</b> out <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night wind." ...|$|R
6000|$|Some day, thought I, I {{will have}} an {{inscription}} <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> right <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midst of the hollow. It came to me, if only this teeming world within knew of the full import of the moment, how furious its tumult would become! ...|$|R
6000|$|The dreamer {{spoke to}} her: [...] "Who are you, <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{darkness}} with those eyes that I can hardly {{bear to look}} at? Who are you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|She did {{not reply}} categorically. <b>Standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{sheltering}} dark, she said, [...] "Papa, I wasn't very candid with you, this afternoon. I am engaged to Mr. Burnamy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why else, indeed?" [...] {{returned}} Asad, {{and then}} he swung upon Oliver <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> entrance of the poop-house. [...] "What sayest thou, Sakr-el-Bahr?" [...] he appealed to him.|$|E
60|$|Hannah looked up. <b>There,</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> burn a {{few yards}} above her, was {{the vision of a}} young man.|$|R
60|$|She nodded, {{and passed}} <b>in</b> through <b>the</b> swinging-doors. <b>Standing</b> out <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> narrow, crooked street, Tavernake heard the {{clapping}} and applause which greeted her entrance, {{he heard her}} father's voice. Some one struck a note at the piano--she was going to sing. Very slowly he turned away {{and walked down the}} cobbled hill.|$|R
6000|$|LADY CHESHIRE bending {{her head}} for [...] "Yes," [...] goes {{out into the}} [...] billiard-room. DOT clasps her hands together, and <b>standing</b> [...] <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of the room, looks from her brother to her [...] father, from her father to her brother. A quaint little pitying [...] smile comes on her lips. She gives a faint shrug of her shoulders.|$|R
6000|$|Everyone wheeled {{round and}} stared at us <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shadow of the gateway tunnel, for the sun behind us was still low. My word, how they did stare! A voice cried: ...|$|E
60|$|The mysterious Marquis {{lifted his}} {{hands with a}} desperate gesture. He was a strange {{scarecrow}} <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sun with half his old face peeled off, and half another face glaring and grinning from underneath.|$|E
60|$|Then all passed, and he {{saw them}} mighty as ever, but deserted, <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> desert, the monuments of a {{forgotten}} greatness, till at length a new people came and stripped off their marble coverings.|$|E
60|$|Valerie {{looked at}} her enemy, and then her eyes strayed round the room and took stock of <b>the</b> men <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> silence, of <b>the</b> Abbot who still {{remained}} at the table-head, a pale, scarce-interested spectator of this odd scene.|$|R
5000|$|Seminarian Mike O'Malley {{was in his}} dorm {{late one}} night when he heard {{footsteps}} coming down the hallway. The footsteps stopped at his door and were followed by a knock on his door. When O'Malley opened the door, he was greeted by a cloaked figure <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> silence. <b>The</b> figure's face was covered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shadow of his hood. Thinking {{it was one of}} the priests, O'Malley asked, [...] "What do you want, father?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{eyed the}} jug. Uncle Tom's {{photograph}} {{had fallen into}} the fender, and it was <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> right out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> open, where Gussie couldn't have helped seeing it. Mercifully, it was empty now.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean that}} I {{should never have}} left you, Craig dear. I know that you never saw that girl before in your life--but I {{did not know it}} until I saw you <b>standing</b> <b>there,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wheat, this evening." ...|$|E
60|$|Her {{lips parted}} {{as though in}} an {{answering}} greeting, but it was inaudible. As I looked round {{at the top of}} the street I saw her still <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> little flood of yellow light, gazing across towards the old market-hall.|$|E
60|$|Diogenes {{turned his}} head in the {{direction}} whence had come the voice. He saw Nicolaes Beresteyn <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cold grey mist, with his fur cloak wrapped closely up to his chin, and his face showing above the cloak, white and drawn.|$|E
6000|$|Finding {{that his}} cries were not {{attended}} to, Snorro staggered {{out of the}} village into the forest a short way, and <b>there,</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of the path, began again,--"O'af! O'af! O'AF! O-o-o!" ...|$|R
60|$|To his surprise, he saw Gernois <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> {{conversation}} with <b>the</b> very stranger {{he had seen}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coffee-house at Bouira the day previous. He could not be mistaken, for there was the same strangely familiar attitude and figure, though the man's back was toward him.|$|R
60|$|Myles turned sharply, {{and then}} his very heart seemed to stand still within him; for <b>there,</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> broad {{sunlight}} without, and glaring <b>in</b> upon <b>the</b> party with baleful eyes, was the Earl of Mackworth himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{knew you}} would break it, but I never thought you could lose your temper over so small a thing, Peter," [...] said Margaret; and he in the shadow {{looked up to see}} her <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sunlight, fresh and lovely as the spring itself.|$|E
60|$|He looked {{huge and}} {{sinister}} to Mr. Gooch, <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> uncertain light; {{it was very}} lonely on that top floor {{and the rest of}} the world seemed infinitely far away. Mr. Gooch wavered. He was loyal to his employer, but he was still more loyal to Mr. Gooch.|$|E
60|$|Bob {{was thus}} {{left alone with}} his prize, and a most uncomfortable time he {{appeared}} to be having of it, <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hot sun clinging desperately to the halter, and jumping {{from one side to the}} other when the pony attempted to bite, or strike him with his fore-feet.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think we}} shall have any trouble on board," [...] he said; [...] "if there is any, it will be after we have landed. But you can {{keep an eye on}} that foreign sailor <b>standing</b> alone <b>there</b> up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bows." ...|$|R
6000|$|And then, <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> great wilderness, it flashed upon me for {{the first}} time just what the wise old prophet meant; though he wrote long ago, in a distant land, and another than Cloud Wings had taught her little ones, all {{unconscious}} of the kindly eyes that watched out of a thicket: [...] "As the eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings,--so the Lord." ...|$|R
6000|$|After such {{depressing}} experiences Adam's {{resolution was}} at an even lower ebb next morning. We met together under the sunny whispering pine-trees. I wheedled, argued, adjured him in vain. Almost at my wits' end at last, I solemnly warned him that if we failed the showman the following evening, he would assuredly have the law against us. [...] "A pretty pair we shall look, Adam, <b>standing</b> up <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dock--with the black cap and the wigs and the policemen and everything. And not a penny for our pains." ...|$|R
60|$|When the two ladies came out, {{they found}} {{together}} the Pendennises, uncle and nephew, and Harry Foker, Esquire, sucking {{the crook of}} his stick, <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sunshine. To see and to ask to eat were simultaneous with the good-natured Begum, and she invited the three gentlemen to luncheon straightway.|$|E
60|$|Yes. <b>Standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gravel-pit, I {{see three}} old worlds, {{in each of}} which these stones played their part; and this world of man for the fourth, {{and the best of}} all--for man if not for the stones. I speak sober truth. Let me explain it step by step.|$|E
60|$|The sledge came. Gudrun {{dismounted}} {{and they}} all made their farewell. They wanted to go apart, all of them. Birkin took his place, and the sledge drove away leaving Gudrun and Gerald standing on the snow, waving. Something froze Birkin's heart, seeing them <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> isolation of the snow, growing smaller and more isolated.|$|E
60|$|So for a {{long time}} he {{remained}} right where he was. He was so tired that he trembled all over, and he was as frightened as he was tired. He knew that <b>standing</b> out <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water he could be seen {{for a long}} distance, and that made him nervous and fearful. Supposing a hunter on the shore he was trying to reach should see him. Then he would have no chance at all, for the hunter would simply wait for him and shoot him as {{he came out of the}} water.|$|R
60|$|Half asleep, and murmuring broken words, {{they stood}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> angle {{made by the}} bow of the boat. It slipped on down the river. Now a bell struck on the bridge, and they heard the lapping of water as it rippled away on either side, and once a bird startled in its sleep creaked, flew on to the next tree, and was silent again. The {{darkness}} poured down profusely, and left them with scarcely any feeling of life, except that they were <b>standing</b> <b>there</b> together <b>in</b> <b>the</b> darkness.|$|R
6000|$|Before them on {{the right}} {{extended}} Mr. Harrison's broad, gray-green field of late oats, wet and luxuriant; and <b>there,</b> <b>standing</b> squarely <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of it, up to her sleek sides <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lush growth, and blinking at them calmly over the intervening tassels, was a Jersey cow! ...|$|R
