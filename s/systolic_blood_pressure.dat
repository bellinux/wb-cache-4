5|$|While {{reduction}} of sodium intake {{to less than}} 2,300mg per day is recommended by developed countries, one review recommended that sodium intake be reduced to at least 1,200mg (contained in 3g of salt) per day, as a further reduction in salt intake the greater the fall in <b>systolic</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> for all age groups and ethinicities. Another review indicated that there is inconsistent/insufficient evidence to conclude that reducing sodium intake to lower than 2,300mg per day is either beneficial or harmful.|$|E
5|$|People whose CT scan shows a large hematoma, {{depressed}} {{level of}} consciousness, or focal neurologic signs {{may benefit from}} urgent surgical removal of the blood or occlusion of the bleeding site. The remainder are stabilized more extensively and undergo a transfemoral angiogram or CT angiogram later. It is hard to predict who will have a rebleed, yet it may happen {{at any time and}} carries a dismal prognosis. After the first 24hours have passed, rebleeding risk remains around 40 percent over the subsequent fourweeks, suggesting that interventions should be aimed at reducing this risk as soon as possible. Some predictors of early rebleeding are high <b>systolic</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> the presence of a hematoma in the brain or ventricles, poor Hunt-Hess grade (III-IV), aneurysms in the posterior circulation, and an aneurysm >10mm in size.|$|E

5|$|If the <b>systolic</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> falls below 90 mmHg {{within days}} of the injury, blood supply to the spinal cord may be reduced, {{resulting}} in further damage. Thus it is important to maintain the blood pressure using a central venous catheter, intravenous fluids, and vasopressors, and to treat cases of shock. Mean arterial blood pressure is measured and kept at 85 to 90 mmHg for seven days after injury. The treatment for shock from blood loss (hypovolemic shock) is different from that for neurogenic shock, and could harm people with the latter type, so it is necessary to determine why someone is in shock. However it is also possible for both causes to exist at the same time. Another important aspect of care is prevention of hypoxia (insufficient oxygen in the bloodstream), which could deprive the spinal cord of much-needed oxygen. People with cervical injuries may experience a dangerously slowed heart rate; treatment to speed it up include atropine and electrical cardiac pacing.|$|E
5|$|In humans, sodium is an {{essential}} mineral that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500 milligrams per day. Sodium chloride is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative in such commodities as pickled preserves and jerky; for Americans, most sodium chloride comes from processed foods. Other sources of sodium are its natural occurrence in food and such food additives as monosodium glutamate (MSG), sodium nitrite, sodium saccharin, baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), and sodium benzoate. The US Institute of Medicine set its Tolerable Upper Intake Level for sodium at 2.3grams per day, but the average person in the United States consumes 3.4grams per day. Studies have found that lowering sodium intake by 2g per day tends to lower <b>systolic</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> by about two to four mmHg. It {{has been estimated that}} such a decrease in sodium intake would lead to between 9 and 17% fewer cases of hypertension.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To compare finger <b>systolic</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressures</b> {{in males}} and females and in younger and older persons and provide normal values for all four fingers in younger and older {{males and females}}. Methods: Eighty healthy {{subjects}} participated in the study: 20 males and 20 females aged 20 – 30 years, and 20 males and 20 females aged 55 – 65 years. Finger <b>systolic</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressures</b> (FSBPs) were measured using strain-gauge plethysmography following local cooling at 30 and 10 °C in accord with International Standard 14835 - 2. The FSBPs were measured simultaneously in the thumb and the four fingers of the dominant hand and the percentage changes in finger <b>systolic</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressures</b> (%FSBPs) due to the cold provocation were calculated. Results: The median finger <b>systolic</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressures</b> increased with increasing age in both females and males, with the increase highly significant at 30 °C but not at 10 °C. The %FSBPs were not significantly affected {{by the age of}} males, but were significantly lower in older females than younger females. The FSBPs were lower in females than in males at 30 °C but {{there was no significant difference}} between genders at 10 °C. The %FSBPs were higher in younger females than younger males, but only significantly higher in the middle finger and there were no significant differences between the genders in the older age group. There were only minor differences between the four fingers in the FSBPs at 30 and 10 °C. The %FSBPs across the four fingers were similar in the younger subjects and in the older females, but varied with finger in the older males. Conclusion: Although there are some differences in the %FSBPs associated with age, gender, and finger, the differences may be sufficiently small to use a single value criterion when deciding on abnormalities in FSBP associated with cold provocation for persons aged 20 – 65 years...|$|R

25|$|Vasopressin receptors {{activated}} by vasopressin are {{found on the}} basolateral membrane of the cells lining the collecting ducts of the kidneys. Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage(aSAH) results in hyponatremia which leads to water retention and antidiuretic hormone release causing increase in intracranial pressure and formation of cerebral edema. This can be prevented by administration of conivaptan, a safe FDA approved drug that treats euvolemic hyponatremia. Through the process of aquaresis, conivapten which is a vasopressin receptor antagonist improves serum sodium concentration while eliminating free water without having any negative effect on <b>systolic</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> and pulse rate. Since it can decrease cerebral volume and ICP, it has a potential to treat many forms of cerebral edema.|$|E
25|$|While diastolic blood {{pressure}} is diminished and the pulse pressure widens, <b>systolic</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure</b> generally remains normal or can even be slightly elevated, this is because sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis of the kidneys compensate for the decreased cardiac output. Catecholamines will increase the heart rate and increase the strength of ventricular contraction, directly increasing cardiac output. Catecholamines will also cause peripheral vasoconstriction, which causes increased systemic vascular resistance and ensures that organs are adequately perfused. Renin, a proteolytic enzyme, cleaves angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is converted to angiotensin II. In the case of chronic aortic insufficiency with resultant cardiac remodeling, heart failure will develop, {{and it is possible}} to see systolic pressures diminish. Aortic insufficiency causes both volume overload (elevated preload) and pressure overload (elevated afterload) of the heart.|$|E
25|$|In angina {{patients}} momentarily {{not feeling}} any chest pain, an electrocardiogram (ECG) is typically normal unless {{there have been}} other cardiac problems in the past. During periods of pain, depression, or elevation of the ST segment may be observed. To elicit these changes, an exercise ECG test ("treadmill test") may be performed, during which the patient exercises to his/her maximum ability before fatigue, breathlessness, or pain intervenes; if characteristic ECG changes are documented (typically more than 1mm of flat or downsloping ST depression), the test is considered diagnostic for angina. Even constant monitoring of the blood pressure and the pulse rate can lead to some conclusion regarding angina. The exercise test is also useful in looking for other markers of myocardial ischemia: blood pressure response (or lack thereof, in particular, a drop in <b>systolic</b> <b>blood</b> <b>pressure),</b> dysrhythmia and chronotropic response. Other alternatives to a standard exercise test include a thallium scintigram or sestamibi scintigram (in patients unable to exercise enough {{for the purposes of the}} treadmill tests, e.g., due to asthma or arthritis or in whom the ECG is too abnormal at rest) or Stress Echocardiography.|$|E
