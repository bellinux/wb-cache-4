40|$|Golf swing {{machines}} {{have become}} fundamental {{tools in the}} development of new equipment because they provide more consistent <b>swing</b> <b>motions</b> than golfers. Golf robots perform a simplification of the complex sequence of motions that compose a golf swing; however, traditional devices are typically capable of performing only a single swing profile at variable speeds. Significant differences exist between individual golfers’ <b>swing</b> <b>motions,</b> especially for golfers of different ability, experience, and physical stature, which suggests a requirement for swing profile variability in mechanical simulators. This investigation has found that the swing motion of a traditional golf robot provides a poor representation of golfers’ swings and, as a result, a bespoke control system has been developed for a commercially available golf robot to enable performance of variable swing profiles with positional feedback. Robot swing command files are generated by fitting a curve to a number of discrete data points that are equally spaced in time, and which define angles representative of individual golfers’ swings. The swing profiles of a professional golfer and a traditional golf robot were repeated accurately using this golf robot with a modified motion control system. The capability for individual golfers’ swings to be accurately replicated using a mechanical device was demonstrated using feedback data. All manufacturers recognize the importance of tailoring equipment to the unique characteristics of a particular golfer’s swing, and this increased robot functionality will provide considerable benefits {{in the development of}} customized equipment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This article {{presents}} a control method for suppressing the swing vibration of a hybrid excavator. For control design, dynamic models of typical <b>swing</b> <b>motions</b> of the hybrid excavator are derived using a system identification technique. Because the system {{states of the}} obtained models are not directly measurable, a sliding mode observer is designed to estimate the system states. A sliding mode control {{is designed to provide}} robust tracking performance against the parameter variations and uncertain non-linearities caused by changes in the working conditions. A complicated mathematical model of the hybrid excavator which captures detailed mechanical, electrical, and hydraulic characteristics is developed for system analysis and simulation. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control method are verified by simulations and actual tests in comparison with a conventional proportional and integral controller...|$|E
30|$|We applied {{auditory}} BF {{for three}} reasons: (1) auditory feedback is preferable for motor learning [20], (2) visual and haptic feedback tends {{to interfere with}} the bat swing and other information, and (3) auditory BF would be an optimal method for instructing temporal sequence (e.g., melody road [21]) especially when swinging a bat. Regarding point (2), we assumed that the players would incorporate kinetic skills in their future training. Visual feedback would detract players from watching the pitching motion and the pitched ball, degrading their hitting accuracy. Meanwhile, haptic feedback would combine with the sense of the swing motion. Increasing the magnitude of the haptic feedback is a poor solution, because large haptic feedback exerts a negative impact on swing motion. Auditory feedback, in contrast, enables the trainees to ascertain their ball pitches (visual sense) and <b>swing</b> <b>motions</b> (somatic sense) without interference.|$|E

The guide ropes (6 a, 6 h) are loaded by a tensile force which acts constantly against the <b>swinging</b> <b>motion</b> of the load.

Finally, the proposed model was tested with data from a real-world ship <b>swing</b> <b>motion.</b> Results show that the model maximum absolute error and mean squared error are respectively 0. 2739 degree and 0. 0110, so the proposed model is capable of prediction...|$|R
40|$|Golf {{is one of}} the few {{games that}} can be enjoyed by players of all ages and its {{popularity}} has grown consistently to achieve the largest sports equipment turnover in both the UK and the USA; consequently, more effort has been expended on golf related research than any other sport. Significant increases in golf equipment performance have been achieved within the past few decades; which in turn, have brought about increased demands for high-technology, high-performance golf equipment. Golfers are used extensively by manufacturers during the testing and development of equipment, where player performances, opinions and perceptions are valued sources of information, however, golfers are inconsistent in performance and they tire. One method of overcoming these shortcomings has been the development of golf swing simulation devices or robots which have been used increasingly over the last four decades. These produce consistent repeatable swings and are now intrinsic instruments for the scientific study of golf by manufacturers, governing bodies and academic institutes alike. The capability of artificial devices to perform human dynamic motions is undoubtedly improving; however, comparatively little scientific effort has been invested to ensure that the <b>swing</b> <b>motions</b> provided by these mechanical devices are representative of golfers' swings. A three-dimensional kinematic study of golfers' swings was undertaken to determine joint positions representative of a double pendulum simplification of the swing and shaft deflection and ball launch data were recorded to permit comparison. A technique for generating golf robot swing commands from the kinematic swing data was developed using interpolation algorithms that ensured the desired number of command joint positions and increased the continuity of the command position derivatives. The <b>swing</b> <b>motions</b> of six golfers with distinctive swing performance characteristics were replicated using a commercially available golf robot with independent axes control and a bespoke modified motion control system. The research has shown that the new robot control system in conjunction with 3 D kinematic swing data enables individual golfers' swings to be replicated with both high levels of accuracy and repeatability.

30|$|In the {{previous}} {{work on the}} thermal walker, a prototype successfully walked on a hot surface heated at 170 [*]°C [8]. By utilizing deformations of the bimetal sheets, the walker swung its body in sideways that lifted up one of its legs. The lifted leg behaved as a pendulum and thus swung forward and then landed, as the sideways swing of the body was restored. Repeating such <b>swing</b> <b>motions,</b> the thermal walker successfully walked on a hot horizontal surface. The temperature required for walking was considerably high {{and a lot of}} efforts should be made to ease the requirement of the temperature. If the temperature could be lowered in future work, the walker would be able to walk on, e.g., a hot ground surface during summer. Moreover, the mechanism would be integrated to a general bipedal robot to reduce the energy consumption; the bipedal robot would still rely on the conventional motors, but the thermal walking mechanism might help to reduce the energy consumption of the motors.|$|E
40|$|Abstract There is {{a strong}} push within the mining sector to {{automate}} equipment such as large excavators. A challenging problem is the control of motion on high in-ertia degrees of freedom where the actuators are constrained in the power they can deliver to and extract from the system and the machine’s underlying control system sits between the automation system and the actuators. The swing motion of an elec-tric mining shovel is a good example. This paper investigates the use of predictive models to achieve minimum time <b>swing</b> <b>motions</b> {{in order to address}} the question what level of performance is possible in terms of realizing minimum time motions and accurate positional control. Experiments are described that explore these ques-tions. The work described is associated with a project to automate an electric mining shovel and whilst the control law discussed here is a much simplified form of that used in this work, the experimental study sheds considerable light on the problem. ...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Golfers are used extensively for equipment testing and development, however, they are inconsistent in performance and they tire. Golf swing simulation devices overcome these shortcomings producing consistent repeatable swings and are now intrinsic instruments for golf research conducted by manufacturers governing bodies and academic institutes. The capability of artificial devices to perform human dynamic motions is undoubtedly improving; however, comparatively little scientific effort has been invested {{to ensure that the}} <b>swing</b> <b>motions</b> provided by these mechanical devices are representative of golfers' swings. An extensive 3 D kinematic study of golfers' swings was undertaken to determine joint positions representative of a double pendulum model of the swing along with ball launch and shaft deflection data. A technique for generating golf robot motion commands from the kinematic swing data was then developed using interpolation algorithms to increase the continuity of command derivatives. Six golfers' swings with distinctive swing performance characteristics were replicated using a commercially availablem odem golf robot and a bespokem otion control system. Quantitative data captured from 20 golfers were compared using gender and skill classifications. All golfers were found to perform consistent <b>swing</b> <b>motions</b> and the kinematic sequencing of joint segments supported the summation of speed principle. Higher skill rated golfers were found to perform swings with greater consistency, faster clubhead speeds at impact, faster down swings and greater delayed wrist releases. The research has shown that the new robot control system in conjunction with 3 D kinematic swing data and a feed-forward control enables in dividual golfer's swings to be replicated with both high levels of accuracy and repeatability. The capability for golfers' swings to be replicated accurately using a mechanical device provides new impetus for both clubfitting methodologies and optimisation of swing technique. However, the boundary constraint of the club at the robot's gripping mechanism was found to provide poor representation of golfers' grip, and consequently, the first bending mode of the club was excited during simulations and resultant shaft deflection and ball launch data correlated less well with the golfers' data. Development of the club gripping mechanism has been identified as an area for future research as the benefits of the new robot control system will only be fully realised if this interface is improved...|$|E

Inspired of the flexible shape and motion of undulating fin of “Nilotic Ghost ” fish, a Hydraulic-driven Bionic Undulating Robot (HBUR) is developed and {{studied in the}} paper based on CFD method, to investigate the flexible characteristics of shape adaptation and hydrodynamics of HBUR fin, which has great significance for the propelling safety of HBUR underwater. In this paper, a mathematical model is brought forward to indicate the undulating motion of HBUR, which is formed by sequentially and periodically <b>swing</b> <b>motions</b> of Hydraulic Swing Actors (HSAs), and then the CFD method is introduced to calculate the hydro-forces when undulating shape of HBUR fin are distorted, because of distraction underwater.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} a golf swing to detect improper motion in the early phase of the swing. Led {{by the desire to}} achieve a consistent shot outcome, a particular golfer would (in multiple trials) prefer to perform completely identical golf swings. In reality, some deviations from the desired motion are always present due to the comprehensive nature of the swing motion. Swing motion deviations that are not detrimental to performance are acceptable. This analysis is conducted using a golfer’s leading arm kinematic data, which are obtained from a golfer wearing a motion sensor that is comprised of gyroscopes and accelerometers. Applying the principal component analysis (PCA) to the reference observations of properly performed swings, the PCA components of acceptable swing motion deviations are established. Using these components, the motion deviations in the observations of other swings are examined. Any unacceptable deviations that are detected indicate an improper swing motion. Arbitrarily long observations of an individual player’s swing sequences can be included in the analysis. The results obtained for the considered example show an improper swing motion in early phase of the swing, i. e., {{the first part of the}} backswing. An early detection method for improper <b>swing</b> <b>motions</b> that is conducted on an individual basis provides assistance for performance improvement...|$|E

40|$|Tracking {{control in}} x-y plane of an {{offshore}} container crane Dongho Kim and Youngjin Park A tracking controller is proposed for a crane {{attached to a}} mobile harbor (MH) equipped with a dual-stage trolley system, to dynamically position a container from the MH to the container ship or vice versa. Wave-induced motions of the MH and container ship occur during loading and unloading operations owing to external disturbances such as waves. However, a challenging task is to move a payload with unwanted <b>swing</b> <b>motions</b> accurately to the loading and unloading positions on a moving target vessel. To solve this problem, a dynamic MH crane model is derived in three-dimensional space, with roll, pitch, and heave motions caused by sea-wave disturbances. The MH crane model is then linearized to design a tracking controller and {{the parameters of the}} linearized model are obtained by carrying out the system identification process. A preview tracking control method that includes feedback and feed-forward control with the predicted target position in the x-y plane in the near future is utilized.

40|$|The human joint {{kinematics}} is {{an interesting}} topic in biomechanics and turns to be useful {{for the analysis of}} human movement in several fields. A crucial issue regards the assessment of joints parameters, like axes and centers of rotation, due to the direct influence on human motion patterns. A proper accuracy in the estimation of these parameters is hence required. On the whole, stereo-photogrammetry based predictive methods and, as an alternative, functional ones can be used to this end. This paper presents a new functional algorithm for the assessment of knee joint parameters, based on a polycentric hinge model for the knee flexion-extension. The proposed algorithm is discussed, identifying its fields of application and its limits.

40|$|This report {{details the}} {{development}} and demonstration of a collision control technology for P&H-class mining shovels that minimizes the frequency and severity of dipper collisions between the bucket, crawler tracks and floor. The work was funded by ACARP as project C 15038. The collision control technology uses a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework whereby control actions for preventing collisions, are chosen based on the predicted future behaviour of the shovel. The system predicts future locations of the dipper over a receding time horizon using a set of mathematical models that are driven by the operator’s joystick commands. The prediction models incorporate the shovel’s electro-mechanical dynamics for hoist, crowd and <b>swing</b> <b>motions.</b> Predicted future bucket positions are tested for collisions using computational geometry algorithms on VRML models of the bucket, crawler tracks and floor. If a collision is predicted, the collision prevention algorithms calculate the minimum change to the operator’s command that will avoid the collision by a specified clearance distance. The altered joystick references are then passed to the P&H Centurion control system over the shovel’s PROFIBUS control bus. The technology has been successfully demonstrated on the CRCMining P&H 2100 BLE research shovel at Bracalba Quarry in Queensland and on a P&H 4100 A at Caballo Mine in Wyoming USA. The technology is currently being commercialized by P&H Mining Equipment...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: We are {{required}} {{on a daily}} basis to estimate our position and motion in space by centrally combining noisy, incomplete, and potentially conflicting or ambiguous, information from both sensory sources (e. g. vestibular organs, visual, proprioceptive), and non-sensory sources (e. g. efferent copy, cognition)). This "spatial orientation" is normally subconscious, and information from multiple sense organs is automatically fused into perception. As late as the early nineteenth century, very little was known about the underlying mechanisms, and our understanding of some critical factors such as such as how the brain resolves the tilt-translation ambiguity is only now beginning to be understood. The otolith organs function like a three-axis linear accelerometer, responding to the vector difference between gravity and linear acceleration (GIF= g - a). How does the brain separate gravity from linear acceleration? How does the brain combine cues from disparate sensors to derive an overall perception of motion? What happens if these sensors provide conflicting information? Humans routinely perform balance tasks {{on a daily basis}}, sometimes in the absence of visual cues. The inherent complexity of the tasks is evidenced by the wide range of balance pathologies and locomotive difficulties experienced by people with vestibular disorders. Maintaining balance involves stabilizing the body's inverted pendulum dynamics where the center of rotation (at the ankles) is below the center of mass and the vestibular sensors are above the center of rotation (for example, swaying above the ground level or balancing during standing or walking). This type of swing motion is also encountered in most fixed-wing aircraft and flight simulators, where the pilot is above the center of roll. <b>Swing</b> <b>motions</b> where the center of mass and sensors are below the center of rotation are encountered on a child's swing, and in some high-wing aircraft and helicopters. Spatial orientation tasks requiring central integration of sensory information are ubiquitous in aerospace. Spatial disorientation, often triggered by unusual visual or flight conditions, is attributed to around 10 % of aviation accidents, and many of these are fatal. Simulator training is a key factor in establishing the supremacy of instrument-driven flight information over vestibular and other human sensory cues in the absence of reliable visual information. It therefore becomes important to ensure that simulators re-create motion perceptions as accurately as possible. What cues can safely be ignored or replaced with analogous cues? How realistic and consistent must a visual scene be to maintain perceptual fidelity? Spatial orientation is also a critical human factor in spaceflight. Orientation and navigation are impaired by the lack of confirming gravitation cues in microgravity, as sensory cues are misinterpreted and generate the incorrect motion perceptions. These persist at least until the vestibular or central nervous system pathways adapt to the altered gravity environment, however human navigation never fully adapts to the three dimensional frame. There is a wealth of data describing the difficulties with balance, gait, gaze control, and spatial orientation on return to Earth. Post-flight ataxia (a neurological sign of gross incoordination of motor movements) is a serious concern for all returning space travelers for at least ten days. This would be an even more serious concern for newly arrived astronauts conducting operations extraterrestrial environments after a long space flight. What motion profiles in a lunar landing simulator on Earth will best prepare astronauts for the real task in an altered gravity environment? Far from being a problem restricted to a human operator, the aerospace systems themselves face the same challenge of integrating sensory information for navigation. Modeling how the brain performs multi-sensory integration has analogies to how aircraft and spacecraft perform this task, and in fact modelers have employed similar techniques. Thus, developments in modeling multi-sensory integration improve our understanding of both the operator and the vehicle. Specifically, this research is concerned with how human motion perception is affected during swing motion when vestibular information is incomplete or ambiguous, or when conflicting visual information is provided. by Andrew Alan Rader.
