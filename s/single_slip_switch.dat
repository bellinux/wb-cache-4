50|$|A <b>single</b> <b>slip</b> <b>switch</b> {{works on}} the same {{principle}} as a double slip, but provides for only one switching possibility. Trains approaching {{on one of the}} two crossing tracks can either continue over the crossing, or switch tracks to the other line. However, trains from the other track can only continue over the crossing, and cannot switch tracks. This is normally used to allow access to sidings and improve safety by avoiding having switch blades facing the usual direction of traffic. To reach the sidings from what would be a facing direction, trains must continue over the crossing, then reverse along the curved route (usually onto the other line of a double track) and can then move forward over the crossing into the siding.|$|E
50|$|An outside <b>slip</b> <b>switch</b> {{is similar}} to the double or <b>single</b> <b>slip</b> <b>switches</b> {{described}} above, except that the switch blades are outside of the diamond instead of inside. An advantage over an inside <b>slip</b> <b>switch</b> is that trains can pass the slips with higher speeds. A disadvantage over an inside <b>slip</b> <b>switch</b> is that they are longer and need more space.|$|R

50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was capable}} of using either an over-running or under-running third rail by means of retractable shoes operated by pneumatic cylinders. The shoes were retracted to the vertical position outside of third rail territory: if extended, electrically live shoes would have projected towards the low-level station platforms that were the norm until the 1970s. A few early examples were fitted with a small DC pantograph for use within New York City's Grand Central Terminal, where long gaps exist in the third rail because of the complex trackage that includes numerous <b>single</b> and double <b>slip</b> <b>switches</b> and double track ladders. These pantographs were soon removed. The complex trackage remains, but the overhead power rails are long gone.|$|R

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that {{examinations}} of the monotonic tensile and fatigue behaviors of single crystal nickel-base superalloys have disclosed orientation-dependent tension-compression anisotropies and {{significant differences in the}} mechanical response of octahedral and cube slip at intermediate temperatures. An examination is conducted of the cyclic hardening response of the single crystal superalloy PWA 1480 at 650 C. In the considered case, tension-compression anisotropy is present, taking into account primarily conditions under which a <b>single</b> <b>slip</b> system is operative. Aspects of a deformation by <b>single</b> <b>slip</b> are considered along with cyclic hardening anisotropy in tension and compression. It is found that specimens deforming by octahedral <b>slip</b> on a <b>single</b> <b>slip</b> system have similar hardening responses in tensile and low cycle fatigue loading.

40|$|AbstractGrain size {{seems to}} have only a minor {{influence}} on the cyclic strain strain curves (CSSCs) of metallic polycrystals of medium to high stacking fault energy (SFE). That is why many authors tried to deduce the macroscopic CSSCs curves from the single crystals ones. Either crystals oriented for <b>single</b> <b>slip</b> or crystals oriented for multiple slip could be considered. In addition, a scale transition law should be used (from the grain scale to the macroscopic scale). Authors generally used either the Sachs rule (homogeneous <b>single</b> <b>slip)</b> or the Taylor one (homogeneous plastic strain, multiple slip). But the predicted macroscopic CSSCs do not generally agree with the experimental data for metals and alloys, presenting various SFE values. In {{order to avoid the}} choice of a particular scale transition rule, many finite element (FE) computations have been carried out using meshes of polycrystals including more than one hundred grains without texture. This allows the study of the influence of the crystalline constitutive laws on the macroscopic CSSCs. Activation of a secondary slip system in grains oriented for <b>single</b> <b>slip</b> is either allowed or hindered (slip planarity), which affects strongly the macroscopic CSSCs. The more planar the slip, the higher the predicted macroscopic stress amplitudes. If grains oriented for <b>single</b> <b>slip</b> obey slip planarity and two crystalline CSSCs are used (one for <b>single</b> <b>slip</b> grains and one for multiple slip grains), then the predicted macroscopic CSSCs agree well with experimental data provided the SFE is not too low (316 L, copper, nickel, aluminium). Finally, the incremental self-consistent Hill-Hutchinson homogeneization model is used for predicting CSS curves and partially validated with respect to the curves computed by the FE method...|$|R

Electron microscopy observations revealed glide steps at the surface indicating <b>single</b> <b>slip.</b> While the slip steps at the surface must have formed by the predominant activation of the primary glide system, analysis of Laue peak streaking directions revealed that, even at low strains, dislocations had been activated and stored on an unpredicted slip system.

The rate of hardening in the second stage increased with strain amplitude {{and the amount of}} secondary slip. In crystals oriented for <b>single</b> <b>slip</b> kink bands developed on their side faces during rapid hardening stage which resulted in considerable amount of asterism in Laue spots. A cyclic stress-strain curve independent of prior history was found to exist which was also independent of crystal orientation.

40|$|AbstractThe {{relationships}} between a slip {{system in the}} parent lattice and its transform by twinning shear are considered in regards to tangential continuity conditions on the plastic distortion rate at twin/parent interface. These conditions are required at coherent interfaces like twin boundaries, which can be assigned zero surface-dislocation content. For two adjacent crystals undergoing <b>single</b> <b>slip,</b> relations between plastic slip rates, slip directions and glide planes are accordingly deduced. The fulfillment of these conditions is investigated in hexagonal lattices {{at the onset of}} twinning in a <b>single</b> <b>slip</b> deforming parent crystal. It is found that combinations of slip system and twin variant verifying the tangential continuity of the plastic distortion rate always exist. In all cases, the Burgers vector belongs to the interface. Certain twin modes are only admissible when slip occurs along an 〈a〉 direction of the hexagonal lattice, and some others only with a 〈c+a〉 slip. These predictions are in agreement with EBSD orientation measurements in commercially pure Ti sheets after plane strain compression...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{continuum}} {{description of}} the time evolution of an ensemble of parallel straight dislocations has been recently derived from the equation of motions of individual dislocations. The predictions of the continuum model were compared {{to the results of}} discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) simulations for several different boundary conditions. It was found that it is able to reproduce all the features of the dislocation ensembles obtained by DDD simulations. The continuum model, however, is systematically established only for <b>single</b> <b>slip.</b> Due to the complicated structure of the equations extending the derivation procedure for multiple slip is not straightforward. In this paper an alternative approach based on a thermodynamics-like principle is proposed to derive continuum equations for <b>single</b> <b>slip.</b> An effective free energy is introduced even for zero physical temperature, which yields equilibrium conditions giving rise to Debye-like screening, furthermore, it generates dynamical equations along the line of phase field theory.
