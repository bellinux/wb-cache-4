5|$|Turner was {{introduced}} to Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism in 1973 by a friend of Ike's named Valerie Bishop. Turner wrote in her autobiography I, Tina that after Valerie taught her to recite the Buddhist chant Nam Myoho Renge Kyo, Tina observed that Ike, instead of hitting her for singing supposed wrong notes during recording sessions, would give her money to go shopping, something <b>she</b> <b>regarded</b> as a benefit of her newfound spiritual practice.|$|E

She was principal of Cheltenham Ladies' College from 1907 until 1922. In 1920, she became Justice of the Peace for Cheltenham, {{becoming one of the}} first women magistrates in England. Faithfull started the organisation that is now Lilian Faithfull Homes in Cheltenham, and she spent the last few months of her life in the care of one of the homes, Faithfull House, until her death in 1952.|$|E
5|$|While in Kuwait, Manning {{was placed}} on suicide watch after her {{behavior}} caused concern. She was moved from Kuwait to the Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, on July 29, 2010, and classified as a maximum custody detainee with Prevention of Injury (POI) status. POI status is one stop short of suicide watch, entailing checks by guards every five minutes. Her lawyer, David Coombs, a former military attorney, said Manning {{was not allowed to}} sleep between 5 am (7 am on weekends) and 8 pm, and was made to stand or sit up if she tried to. She was required to remain visible at all times, including at night, which entailed no access to sheets, no pillow except one built into her mattress, and a blanket designed not to be shredded. Manning complained that <b>she</b> <b>regarded</b> it as pretrial punishment.|$|E

25|$|Mrs. King had {{difficulty}} settling her {{children with the}} news that their father was deceased. She received a large number of telegrams, including one from Lee Harvey Oswald's mother, which <b>she</b> <b>regarded</b> as the one that touched her the most.|$|E
25|$|There were {{tensions}} {{in the relationship between}} young Alice and her stepmother, who had known her husband's previous wife and made it clear that <b>she</b> <b>regarded</b> her predecessor as a beautiful, but insipid, childlike fool. Edith once angrily told her that if Alice Hathaway Lee had lived, she would have bored Theodore to death.|$|E
25|$|The marriage, however, {{was unhappy}} and childless. Aribert was {{homosexual}} and, perhaps {{after he was}} caught {{in bed with a}} man, the marriage was annulled on 13 December 1900 by his father. Princess Marie Louise, on an official visit to Canada at the time, immediately returned to Britain. According to her memoirs, <b>she</b> <b>regarded</b> her marriage vows as binding, so she never remarried.|$|E

25|$|Hirsi Ali is a {{prominent}} opponent of female genital mutilation (FGM), {{which she has}} criticized in many of her writings. When in Dutch parliament, she proposed obligatory annual medical checks for all uncircumcised girls living in the Netherlands who came from countries where FGM is practised. She proposed that if a physician found that a Dutch girl had been mutilated, {{a report to the}} police would be required– with protection of the child prevailing over privacy. In 2004 she also criticized male circumcision, particularly as practiced by Jews and Muslims, which <b>she</b> <b>regarded</b> as being another variant of mutilation practiced without the consent of the individual.|$|E
25|$|After the {{revolution}} radicalized further and headed towards terror, Charlotte Corday began {{to sympathize with}} the Girondins. She admired their speeches and grew fond {{of many of the}} Girondist groups whom she met while living in Caen. She respected the political principles of the Girondins and came to align herself with their thinking. <b>She</b> <b>regarded</b> them as a movement that would ultimately save France. The Gironde represented a more moderate approach to {{the revolution}} and they, like Corday, were skeptical about the direction the revolution was taking. They opposed the Montagnards, who advocated a more radical approach to the revolution, which included the extreme idea that the only way the revolution would survive invasion and civil war was through terrorizing and executing those opposed to it. The opposition to this radical thinking, coupled with the influence of the Gironde, ultimately led Corday to carry out her plan to murder the most radical of them all, Jean-Paul Marat.|$|E

25|$|In April 1756, the Riksdag {{demanded to}} {{inventory}} the crown jewels. The queen replied that {{she refused to}} allow them to see the crown jewels as <b>she</b> <b>regarded</b> them as her private property. At this point, the king was taken ill, and she was thereby given the time to send for the jewels from Berlin. She was finally forced to agree to present them to inventory on 22 June. To prevent this, she and her followers within the Hovpartiet, Hård, Horn and Brahe, planned to stage the coup before that day, despite the protests of king Adolf Frederick. The plan was to bribe members of the public to create riots in the capital. The supporters of the Hovpartiet would then take control of the Stockholm guard and garrison, which were also to be prepared through bribes. When the military was called out to deal with the riots, it would seize control over the capital's military headquarters: the Riksdag would be closed and the opposition arrested and a new Riksdag would be summoned, which would be made to approve of a new constitution, reintroducing absolute monarchy.|$|E
500|$|The {{widespread}} {{worship of}} her memory in Soviet Union today, {{both as an}} artist and as an unsurrendering human being, has, so far as I know, no parallel. The legend of her life and unyielding passive resistance to what <b>she</b> <b>regarded</b> as unworthy of her country and herself, transformed her into a figure [...] not merely in Russian literature, but in Russian history in [...] century.|$|E
500|$|On 13 July 1942, the Franks {{were joined}} by the van Pels family: Hermann, Auguste, and 16-year-old Peter, and then in November by Fritz Pfeffer, a dentist and friend of the family. Frank wrote of her {{pleasure}} at having new people to talk to, but tensions quickly developed within the group forced to live in such confined conditions. After sharing her room with Pfeffer, she {{found him to be}} insufferable and resented his intrusion, and she clashed with Auguste van Pels, whom <b>she</b> <b>regarded</b> as foolish. <b>She</b> <b>regarded</b> Hermann van Pels and Fritz Pfeffer as selfish, particularly in regard to the amount of food they consumed. Some time later, after first dismissing the shy and awkward Peter van Pels, she recognized a kinship with him and the two entered a romance. She received her first kiss from him, but her infatuation with him began to wane as she questioned whether her feelings for him were genuine, or resulted from their shared confinement. Anne Frank formed a close bond with each of the helpers, and Otto Frank later recalled that she had anticipated their daily visits with impatient enthusiasm. He observed that Anne's closest friendship was with Bep Voskuijl, [...] "the young typist... the two of them often stood whispering in the corner." ...|$|E

500|$|Rebecca Nicholson of The Guardian {{regarded}} the album as a pay off, despite the band [...] "switching it up", where she states [...] "...this is more loose and playful, while still indulging the band's ability {{to pull off}} mammoth, arena-friendly choruses." [...] <b>She</b> <b>regarded</b> the album a little too long, however. David Renshaw at NME observed [...] "...this mainstream rebirth feels like a transitional step to something gigantic." [...] Jon Pareles from The New York Times found that the band's songwriting survived the departure of Josh Farro. In addition, Pareles noted that they [...] "have pushed the band beyond pop-punk without abandoning momentum or the big, catchy chorus." ...|$|E
500|$|From this time, Edward {{gained a}} {{reputation}} as a playboy. Determined to get some army experience, Edward attended manoeuvres in Ireland, during which he spent three nights with an actress, Nellie Clifden, who was hidden in the camp by his fellow officers. Prince Albert, though ill, was appalled and visited Edward at Cambridge to issue a reprimand. Albert died in December 1861 just two weeks after the visit. Queen Victoria was inconsolable, wore mourning clothes {{for the rest of her}} life and blamed Edward for his father's death. At first, <b>she</b> <b>regarded</b> her son with distaste as frivolous, indiscreet and irresponsible. She wrote to her eldest daughter, [...] "I never can, or shall, look at him without a shudder." ...|$|E
500|$|After Hitler's {{mother died}} of breast cancer in 1907, the funeral {{procession}} went through Urfahr to Leonding. Kubizek remarks that Hitler said he had seen Stefanie at the funeral procession, which gave him some consolation. Kubizek claims that [...] "Stefanie had no idea how deeply Adolf was in love with her; <b>she</b> <b>regarded</b> him as a somewhat shy, but nevertheless remarkably tenacious and faithful, admirer. When she responded with a smile to his inquiring glance, he was happy and his mood became unlike anything I had ever observed in him. But when Stefanie, as happened just as often, coldly ignored his gaze, he was crushed and ready to destroy himself and the whole world." ...|$|E
