50|$|The {{midrange}} dome {{is covered}} by a protective wire net. The dome is also partially covered by a ring. The ring is designed {{to function as a}} <b>sound</b> <b>diffuser</b> to improve sound dispersion and stereo imaging, but it also helps protect the dome. Some owners of the NS-1000 and NS-2000 have experimented with removing the wire net and diffuser to hear the difference, but the dome should not be touched. The NS-2000 has a cloth cover, and for some sound purists it makes a sonic difference to them to remove the cover at least (like the muffled sound of talking through a t-shirt or not).|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to design, model, build, and test a flat panel speaker and frame for a spherical dome {{structure}} being made into a simulator. The simulator will be a test bed for evaluating an immersive environment for human interfaces. This project focused on the loud speakers and a <b>sound</b> <b>diffuser</b> for the dome. The {{rest of the team}} worked on an Ambisonics 3 D sound system, video projection system, and multi-direction treadmill to create the most realistic scene possible. The main programs utilized in this project, were Pro-E and COMSOL. Pro-E was used for creating detailed figures for the fabrication of a frame that held a flat panel loud speaker. The loud speaker was made from a thin sheet of Plexiglas and 4 acoustic exciters. COMSOL, a multiphysics finite analysis simulator, was used to model and evaluate all stages of the loud speaker, frame, and <b>sound</b> <b>diffuser.</b> Acoustical testing measurements were utilized to create polar plots from the working prototype which were then compared to the COMSOL simulations to select the optimal design for the dome. The final goal of the project was to install the flat panel loud speaker design in addition to a <b>sound</b> <b>diffuser</b> on to the wall of the dome. After running tests in COMSOL on various speaker configurations, including a warped Plexiglas version, the optimal speaker design included a flat piece of Plexiglas with a rounded frame to match the curvature of the dome. Eight of these loud speakers will be mounted into {{an inch and a half}} of high performance acoustic insulation, or Thinsulate, that will cover the inside of the dome. The following technical paper discusses these projects and explains the engineering processes used, knowledge gained, and the projected future goals of this projec...|$|E

40|$|This is a {{study of}} the {{reverberation}} phenomena into a space. Digital and physical methods are employed as a way to understand the parameters that determine the reverberation time in an indoor space. The comparison of the results between digital and physical modeling permit to establish actions of acoustic control. The surfaces of the space are modified using <b>sounds</b> <b>diffusers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Since the {{invention}} of <b>sound</b> <b>diffusers</b> three decades ago a substantial effort {{has been made to}} predict the acoustic behaviour of these structures, for auralisation and prediction purposes as well as in response to the large costs inherent in anechoic measurements. Volumetric methods such as Finite Element Methods (FEM) or the Finite Difference Time Domain method (FDTD) are not often used, due to their large computational cost. However Near Field to Far Field Transformations (NFFFT) can overcome that problem. The main advantages of the FDTD method are that a single calculation is sufficient to study a wide frequency band, and that the time domain behaviour of the reflected sound can be directly inspected. In this paper we present a comparison between the prediction techniques commented above in the context of <b>sound</b> <b>diffusers,</b> paying special attention to the FDTD method. Having demonstrated that the FDTD method can generate results comparable to more established techniques, early results concerning the modelled performance of diffusers in the time domain (‘time spreading’) are reported, opening a new field of research...|$|R
40|$|Although {{periodic}} structures theory {{gave rise}} to <b>sound</b> <b>diffusers</b> almost 40 years ago, it has been only in recent years when several authors regarded the possible application of {{a particular kind of}} periodic structures, phononic crystals, in the field on room acoustics. This paper explores the possible application of periodic structures used as sound dif-fusers in rooms. Preliminary simulations, carried out with FDTD, shows that due to the inherent time spreading pro-vided by a periodic structure, they can be used to reduce, or even to eliminate, pernicious effects associated with the low frequency modes of the room...|$|R
50|$|They {{completed}} Studio C {{first and}} it began operating in May 1969 with staff that included General Manager Mel Tanner, Booking Agent Ginger Mews, Technician Harry Sitam, and Staff Engineer Russ Gary. Its dimensions were similar to Heider's Studio 3 in Hollywood—though its control room, instead of being at the end the room, was parallel to Studio C's long side. The walls were kept from being parallel with square gypsum devices that were used as mid-range <b>sound</b> <b>diffusers</b> and absorbers. At the Grateful Dead's request, its studio doors were covered with airbrushed paintings. Studios A and D became operational a few months later.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 1952, the Baschets started {{research}} into all existing musical instruments and put this knowledge {{to work in}} creating dozens of structures sonores (i.e., 'sonorous sculptures'). Their visually striking instruments were crafted out of steel and aluminum and amplified by large curved conical sheets of metal, and are most often easy to play and accessible to people with any level of experience. One {{example of this is}} the Hemisfair Musical Fountain, which consists of an array of posts at the top of which are groups of conical <b>sound</b> <b>diffusers,</b> and above them circles of metal prongs. These are played by jets of water aimed by observers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{auditorium}} ceiling {{ranges from}} {{a height of}} 44 ft above the stage to 62 ft at the rear wall. The walls of the stage are covered in a light-colored wood and feature box seats. Suspended above the stage originally were 52 precast concrete [...] "clouds" [...] which helped diffuse sound. In 1990, management added an extensive set of <b>sound</b> <b>diffusers</b> to improve the sound that the musicians heard on stage. These were removed as unsatisfactory after several seasons, and replaced in 2001 {{as part of a}} renovation project. [...] The five-year project began in 1997 and also included a new stage lighting system, new stage risers and equipment lift, expanded storage and performer dressing rooms, increased patron washrooms and improved access for patrons with physical disabilities.|$|R

[...] They added that after the completion of remaining work, it has to pass the quality and commuters’ safety tests, and that the entire process would be completed by last week of November and authorities will either inaugurate the [...] "ambitious" [...] project in last week or November of first week of December, depending upon the availability of representatives from Union Government.|$|R

40|$|We present deep-subwavelength {{diffusing}} surfaces {{based on}} acoustic metamaterials, namely metadiffusers. These <b>sound</b> <b>diffusers</b> are rigidly backed slotted panels, with each slit being loaded by {{an array of}} Helmholtz resonators. Strong dispersion is produced in the slits and slow sound conditions are induced. Thus, the effective thickness of the panel is lengthened introducing its quarter wavelength resonance in the deep-subwavelength regime. By tuning the geometry of the metamaterial, the reflection coefficient of the panel can be tailored to obtain either a custom reflection phase, moderate or even perfect absorption. Using these concepts, we present ultra-thin diffusers where the geometry of the metadiffuser has been tuned to obtain surfaces with spatially dependent reflection coefficients having uniform magnitude Fourier transforms. Various designs are presented where, quadratic residue, primitive root and ternary sequence diffusers are mimicked by metadiffusers whose thickness are 1 / 46 to 1 / 20 times the design wavelength, i. e., between about a twentieth and {{a tenth of the}} thickness of traditional designs. Finally, a broadband metadiffuser panel of 3 [*]cm thick was designed using optimization methods for frequencies ranging from 250 [*]Hz to 2 [*]kHz...|$|R
