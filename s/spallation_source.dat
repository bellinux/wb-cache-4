40|$|One of {{the central}} issues {{in the design and}} the use of pulsed neutron sources is the control of pulse length in elastic {{scattering}} experiments, most significantly diffraction on crystalline matter. On the existing short pulse <b>spallation</b> <b>sources</b> the strongly wavelength dependent source pulse length that determines the resolution is permanently fixed on each beam line by the type of the moderator it faces. We have experimentally implemented {{for the first time the}} wavelength frame multiplication (WFM) multiplexing chopper method, an earlier proposed variant of the by now fully tested repetition rate multiplication technique for inelastic scattering spectroscopy on pulsed neutron sources. We have operated the time-of-flight diffractometer at the continuous reactor source at BNC in an unconventional multiplexing mode that emulates a pulsed source. As a full proof of principle of the WFM method we have experimentally demonstrated the extraction from each source pulse a series of polychromatic, chopper shaped neutron pulses, which can continuously cover any wavelength band. The achieved 25 mu s FWHM pulse length is shorter than that can be obtained at all at short pulse <b>spallation</b> <b>sources</b> for cold neutrons. The method allows us to build efficient, high and variable resolution diffractometers at long pulse <b>spallation</b> <b>sources.</b> (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|The {{technique}} {{requires a}} source of neutrons. Neutrons are usually produced in a nuclear reactor or <b>spallation</b> <b>source.</b> At a research reactor, other components are needed, including a crystal monochromators as well as filters to select the desired neutron wavelength. Some parts of the setup may also be movable. At a <b>spallation</b> <b>source,</b> the time of flight technique is used to sort the energies of the incident neutrons (higher energy neutrons are faster), so no monochromator is needed, but rather a series of aperture elements synchronized to filter neutron pulses with the desired wavelength.|$|E

40|$|Polarized {{neutrons}} {{provide a}} powerful tool for research at today’s continuous neutron sources, permitting unique information to be obtained from neutron-scattering experiments and in the area of fundamental neutron physics. The information obtained is indispensable to important areas of current research such as magnetism, spin fluctuations in correlated-electron materials, nanoscience, astrophysics, and cosmology. Unfortunately, the polarized neutron capabilities that already exist at reactor neutron sources, mainly in Europe, cannot be transferred directly to pulsed <b>spallation</b> <b>sources</b> because many of the devices used at reactors to manipulate neutron spins operate only at a single neutron wavelength or with a neutron beam of limited divergence. Both of these restrictions must be overcome for devices to be useful at pulsed <b>spallation</b> <b>sources.</b> This report identifies the significant R&D efforts that will be required to achieve these goals. These efforts must be undertaken now, {{if they are to be}} useful early in the lifetime of the <b>spallation</b> neutron <b>source</b> (SNS) or its Japanese counterpart, Japanese proton accelerator research complex (J-PARC).
