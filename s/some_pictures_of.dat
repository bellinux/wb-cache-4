5|$|Sergey Zagraevsky, {{a modern}} art historian, {{surveyed}} hundreds of Russian icons and miniatures, from {{the eleventh century}} onward. He concluded that most icons painted after the Mongol invasion of Rus display only onion domes. First onion domes displayed on <b>some</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> twelfth century (two miniatures from Dobrylov Evangelie). He found only one icon from the late fifteenth century displaying a dome resembling the helmet instead of an onion. His findings led him to dismiss fragments of helmet domes discovered by restorators beneath modern onion domes as post-Petrine stylisations intended to reproduce the familiar forms of Byzantine cupolas. Zagraevsky also indicated that the oldest depictions of the two Vladimir cathedrals represent them as having onion domes, prior to their replacement by classicizing helmet domes. He explains the ubiquitous appearance of onion domes in the late thirteenth century by the general emphasis on verticality characteristic of Russian architecture from the late twelfth to early fifteenth centuries. At that period, porches, pilasters, vaults and drums were arranged to create a vertical thrust, to make the church seem taller than it was. It seems logical that elongated, or onion, domes {{were part of the}} same proto-Gothic trend aimed at achieving pyramidal, vertical emphasis.|$|E
25|$|Delicate {{sounds and}} fine overtones were mostly lost, {{because it took}} a lot of sound energy to vibrate the {{recording}} horn diaphragm and cutting mechanism. There were acoustic limitations due to mechanical resonances in both the recording and playback system. <b>Some</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> acoustic recording sessions show horns wrapped with tape to help mute these resonances. Even an acoustic recording played back electrically on modern equipment sounds like it was recorded through a horn, notwithstanding a reduction in distortion because of the modern playback. Toward the end of the acoustic era, there were many fine examples of recordings made with horns.|$|E

500|$|The {{second major}} event that {{hindered}} production involved {{lack of money}} needed for the final scene. Near {{the end of the}} filming, producer Paul Rabwin discovered that there was no money left for a small but necessary sequence created to mimic an actual TV news anchor giving a report. Rather than request extra funds, Rabwin located an Australian TV correspondent, Robert Penfold, who was based out of Los Angeles and asked him to [...] "donate" [...] the needed news report for a chance to be on The X-Files. The individual was more than happy to comply. According to Rabwin, [...] "we went to his studio setup, inserted a visual of a busy newsroom behind the correspondent, added <b>some</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> the kidnapped children, and we had our scene." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's {{producers}} {{launched a}} nationwide talent hunt to discover new faces for the film, initially refusing to employ established actors. However, the actors {{who came to}} audition were not promising enough for the roles, and the idea was scrapped. Mahesh Bhatt said, [...] "It was a disastrous talent hunt. We discovered that people lacked the courage to audition. Those who are amateurs went for audition ...and people with certain talent were like why should we risk public rejection." [...] When Suri saw <b>some</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> Aditya Roy Kapur and met him, he found Kapur perfect for the role and cast him to play the male lead. In June 2012, Shraddha Kapoor was signed to play the female lead. Bhatt said, [...] "Yes, Shraddha Kapoor is playing the lead with the two boys Aditya Roy Kapur and Shaad Randhawa. We found her to be very talented. All three actors have extremely challenging dramatic roles." [...] When asked about replacing new actors with known ones, Suri said [...] "People said I couldn't make a film with new actors and expect an audience to come in. But I was pretty sure I wanted Aditya and Shraddha to play my protagonists. My writer Shagufta Rafique and I saw them as the protagonists. See, Aditya and Shraddha may have had unsuccessful films before. But that never took away from their talent." ...|$|E

A gunman wearing the uniform of the new Afghan National Army opened fire, wounding Gul Agha Sherzai (former governor of Kandahar) and an American Special Operations officer. The gunman, one of the President's bodyguards, and a bystander who knocked down the gunman were killed when Karzai's American bodyguards returned fire. <b>Some</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU) responding to the attempt have surfaced.|$|E

An intentional hard landing {{at the end}} of the mission, <b>some</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> the lunar surface were taken before impact. Hiten was not designed as a Moon lander and had few scientific instruments for lunar exploration. The next Japanese Moon landing program was the LUNAR-A, developed from 1992. Although the LUNAR-A orbiter was cancelled, its penetrators are integrated into the Russian Luna-Glob program, which was scheduled to launch in 2011. The penetrators are [...] "relatively" [...] hard landers, but they are not expected to be destroyed at impact.|$|E
2500|$|Rubber Soul was the group's first release not {{to feature}} their {{name on the}} cover, an {{uncommon}} tactic in 1965. The [...] "stretched" [...] effect of the cover photo came about after photographer Bob Freeman had taken <b>some</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> the group wearing suede leather jackets at Lennon's house. Freeman showed the photos by projecting them onto an album-sized piece of cardboard to simulate how they would appear on an album cover. The unusual Rubber Soul album cover came to be when the slide card fell slightly backwards, elongating the projected image of the photograph and stretching it. Excited by the effect, they shouted, [...] "Ah! Can we have that? Can you do it like that?", to which Freeman said he could. The distinctive lettering was created by photographer Charles Front, who recalled that his inspiration was the album's title: [...] "If you tap into a rubber tree then you get a sort of globule, so I started thinking of creating a shape that represented that, starting narrow and filling out." [...] The rounded letters used on the sleeve established a style that became ubiquitous in psychedelic designs and, according to The Guardian, [...] "a staple of poster art for the flower power generation".|$|E

The artist is an old man, low in stature, and bent with years--fourscore at least. But the eye is quick and the countenance noble.

60|$|Jonas {{went back}} into the tavern, and took his seat by the fire. There was a table before the fire, with a lamp upon it; and there were one or two books and an old {{newspaper}} lying upon another table, in the back part of the room. Jonas looked at the books, but they were not interesting to read. One was a dictionary.

60|$|Ignatius Gallaher puffed thoughtfully at {{his cigar}} and then, {{in a calm}} historian's tone, he {{proceeded}} to sketch for his friend <b>some</b> <b>pictures</b> <b>of</b> the corruption which was rife abroad. He summarised the vices of many capitals and seemed inclined to award the palm to Berlin. Some things he could not vouch for (his friends had told him), but of others he had had personal experience. He spared neither rank nor caste. He revealed many of the secrets of religious houses on the Continent and described some of the practices which were fashionable in high society and ended by telling, with details, a story about an English duchess--a story which he knew to be true. Little Chandler was astonished.|$|E
