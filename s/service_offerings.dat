25|$|Event-driven SOA {{is a form}} of service-oriented {{architecture}} (SOA), combining the intelligence and proactiveness of event-driven architecture with the organizational capabilities found in <b>service</b> <b>offerings.</b> Before event-driven SOA, the typical SOA platform orchestrated services centrally, through pre-defined business processes, assuming that what should have already been triggered is defined in a business process. This older approach (sometimes called SOA 1.0) does not account for events that occur across, or outside of, specific business processes. Thus complex events, in which a pattern of activities—both non-scheduled and scheduled—should trigger a set of services is not accounted for in traditional SOA 1.0 architecture.|$|E
40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{approach}} the mixed findings regarding {{the relationship between a}} firm’s industrial <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> and its performance, this study analyzes the impact of the industrial <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> on sales growth and the moderating role of network capabilities. The proposed research model is tested based on data from 91 Finnish manufacturing firms. Our results demonstrate a non-linear effect of the <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> on sales growth. We also find that network capabilities enhance the effect of the <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> on sales growth. For managers of manufacturing firms, the results imply that the active development of a comprehensive <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> should be implemented in conjunction with the development of organizational capabilities, such as network capabilities, to create value and promote improved performance.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to explore the effect of a complementary mobile and internet <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> around mobile devices on customer perceived value and consumer loyalty, as well as investigate if perceived value can predict consumer loyalty. Gender differences were also explored in both perceived value and loyalty. The study built on a review of existing literature in order to establish the constructs explored and develop the research structure and focus. A consumer study was conducted in the Singapore market and responses collected from 120 respondents to explore respondents’ value perception of the <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> and their attitudinal loyalty. Gender differences were observed in both perceived value and loyalty, with females valuing the <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> more than the males, and also indicating higher attitudinal loyalty toward the <b>service</b> <b>offering.</b> It was found that consumers who have experienced the <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> indicated higher attitudinal loyalty, establishing that the <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> contributes to increased consumer loyalty. It was also established that perceived value predicts loyalty, indicating that where value is perceived in the offering, consumers were more loyal. Limitations in the study restrict the generalization of the results across different markets. A more balanced age group distribution should ideally be conducted in a further study. The remaining dimensions of perceived value and loyalty should also be studied in future research to establish a more comprehensive measure of value and loyalty...|$|R
