Burke was {{confident}} that the war against France was waged against what Revolutionary France represented, and that the English were not fighting against the French nation but against the revolutionaries that were spreading an ideology. In the third letter, Burke mentions that the French had a fleet that could have sent troops into Ireland and aid the Irish in rebelling against Britain. The French, at the <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> stated that they wanted to continue negotiating peace were sending troops to invade. As such, Burke hints at a possible impeachment of Pitt for seeking peace with France.|$|E

2500|$|Some safety {{improvements}} {{were made}} over time, however. Assistant Secretary of Commerce Ewing Y.

Secretary of War George Dern also supported the road closure. But no closure was made at this time. [...] A land-swap that would give the Arlington Experimental Farm most of the old Hoover Field site while giving Washington-Hoover about [...] to the south (thus permitting extension of the runways to a safer length) was proposed in September 1933. The Commission of Fine Arts, the region's most powerful planning body, supported the land-swap as well as closure of Military Road. The land-swap was completed by April 1935, and the airport spent $10,000 widening the runways and building a blimp hangar. Samuel Solomon, a D.C. lawyer, was appointed head of Washington-Hoover Airport in October 1933, and began lobbying heavily for Military Road's closure as well. The Washington Board of Trade threw its weight behind the road closure in March 1934. Arlington County managers said at the <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were already planning to move the road. But again, no closure came.

2500|$|At {{the start}} of 1944, Slim held the {{official}} rank of colonel with a war-time rank of major-general and the temporary rank of lieutenant-general. In January 1944, when the Second Arakan Offensive was met by a Japanese counter-offensive, the Indian 7th Infantry Division was quickly surrounded along with parts of the Indian 5th Infantry Division and the 81st (West Africa) Division. The 7th Indian Division's defence was based largely on the [...] "Admin Box" [...] formed initially from drivers, cooks and suppliers. [...] They were supplied by air, thus negating {{the importance of their}} lost supply lines. The Japanese forces were able to halt the offensive into Arakan but were unable to decisively defeat the allied forces or advance beyond the surrounded formations. In early 1944, the Japanese Prime Minister General Hideki Tojo approved of plans for victory in Asia, calling for two operations, Operation U-Go as the invasion of India was code-named and Operation Ichi-Go which was intended to defeat China once and for all. The two operations in India and China were closely linked given that American supplies for China were flown over [...] "the Hump" [...] of the Himalayas and the Japanese wanted to take the Assam province of India in part to close the American air bases in India that sustained China at the <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were launching Operation Ichi-Go, the biggest Japanese offensive of all time that involved 2 million men. The Japanese knew that they lacked the logistics to invade India, and the plans for U-Go were {{based on the assumption that}} the 14th Army would just collapse, allowing the 15th Army to capture enough food to prevent its men from starving to death. Following the 15th Army into India was the Indian National Army commanded by the fiery anti-British revolutionary Subhas Chandra Bose who had impressed Tojo with his love of violence and carnage.. The Japanese believed that the mere presence of Bose in India would inspire the men of the Indian Army to mutiny and murder their British officers, and set off an anti-British revolution that would allow the 15th Army to take all of India.|$|E
