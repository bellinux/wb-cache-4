500|$|... "Go Big or Go Home" [...] {{received}} critical acclaim, {{with several}} critics particularly complimenting the [...] "Swanson Pyramid of Greatness" [...] joke. HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall said the episode {{was effective in}} appealing to both new and old viewers, developing various character subplots and establishing the harvest festival story arc. He also praised the performances of Chris and Ann, which he called a far better and more interesting pairing than Ann with Mark Brendanawicz. Linda Holmes of NPR suggested the season premiere {{was a good place}} for newcomers to the series to start watching. She said all the characters were funny and the two new cast members had been <b>seamlessly</b> <b>integrated</b> into the show. Time magazine writer James Poniewozik called the episode an [...] "excellent start" [...] to the season, and said the harvest festival subplot would help better focus the series by giving the characters a single goal. Poniewozki said it also [...] "reminds us that the show is about something: the idea, maybe quaint-seeming in this political climate, that civil servants can actually see themselves as servants and work in their community's interest". Damian Holbrook of TV Guide said [...] "Go Big or Go Home" [...] was an improvement on an already strong second season, claiming [...] "the comedy seemed snappier, the relationships better grounded and the ensemble cast at their best." ...|$|E
500|$|Ubisoft {{promised that}} Far Cry 4 would {{have much more}} of a {{multiplayer}} element than Far Cry 3. Some elements that were scrapped for Far Cry 3 due to time constraints were featured in Far Cry 4, such as the [...] "Guns for Hire" [...] co-operative multiplayer mode. Building a co-operative experience was the team's goal starting {{from the beginning of the}} game's development. Originally intended to be a separate mode, it was later made to be <b>seamlessly</b> <b>integrated</b> into the main campaign. The game's competitive multiplayer was designed to give players freedom, allowing players to progress and defeat enemies through a variety of different ways. Red Storm Entertainment also considered players' feedback from the multiplayer aspect of Far Cry 3, and decided to include vehicles to the game. The company chose an asymmetrical structure for the match, so that players could have different experiences in different matches, as well as to make matches feel more chaotic. The developers originally planned to feature female playable characters, but the plan was scrapped due to animation problems. Ubisoft announced a 'Keys to Kyrat' offer for players that owned a copy of the game for the PlayStation 3 or PlayStation 4. It allows those owners to send out game keys to up to ten other people who do not own a copy of the game. Players who are offered a key can join the person that sent them the key and play the co-operative mode for two hours.|$|E
