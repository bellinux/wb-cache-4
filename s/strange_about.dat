5|$|Brian and Stewie {{manage to}} sneak in {{backstage}} at the concert, where Miley asks why they're here. Brian then explains that Stewie has a 'tumor' shaped like a football, which convinces Miley to let them hang out with her backstage. Miley and Stewie quickly become best friends and they sing a song which Stewie wrote. Soon, Chris realizes that the Monkey has {{spent more time with}} him, like taking him to play baseball and going to a father and son BBQ in Monkeykid. Chris then says to Peter that he has never gave as much attention to him as the monkey has, so he grows to resent his own father. While having ice-cream with Miley, Stewie notices a signal interference on her cell phone when handing it to her. He then realises something is <b>strange</b> <b>about</b> Miley. Upon spying on her, Stewie and Brian discover that she is actually an android after seeing an employee insert a USB drive on the control panel on Miley's back. They both realized that Miley was created by Walt Disney Imagineering to become the perfect teen idol that can never fail. When Brian curiously asks if she can perform other tasks, Stewie agrees to reprogram Miley to have sex with Brian by gaining access to the control panel. However, it goes wrong and he accidentally sends Miley into a rage, forcing Stewie and Brian to run away from the monstrous Miley.|$|E
500|$|Following the wake-up call, {{the crew}} was given some time to clean up, have breakfast, and read e-mail which had been uplinked to them from flight controllers. Their work day {{included}} a lunch break at midday (UTC), and ended with a mid-afternoon planning session with flight controllers, regarding the next day's activities. Most days ended with some entertainment, with the crew watching {{all or part of}} a movie; this was thought to be good for crew bonding as well as their psychological well-being. After watching 2010, the sequel to , Shepherd commented, [...] " [...] something <b>strange</b> <b>about</b> watching a movie about a space expedition when you're actually on a space expedition".|$|E
500|$|Mariah Carey, Stevie Wonder, Lionel Richie, John Mayer, Jennifer Hudson, Usher, Jermaine Jackson, and Shaheen Jafargholi {{performed}} at the event. Berry Gordy and Smokey Robinson gave eulogies, while Queen Latifah read [...] "We Had Him", a poem written for the occasion by Maya Angelou. The Reverend Al Sharpton received a standing ovation with cheers when he told Jackson's children: [...] "Wasn't nothing <b>strange</b> <b>about</b> your daddy. It was strange what your daddy had to deal with. But he dealt with it anyway." [...] Jackson's 11-year-old daughter Paris Katherine, speaking publicly for the first time, wept as she told the crowd: [...] "Ever since I was born, Daddy {{has been the best}} father you could ever imagine ... I just wanted to say I love him ... so much." [...] Reverend Lucious Smith provided a closing prayer.|$|E

2500|$|Guest speaker Thomas Muthee's background, {{especially}} his accusations of witchcraft against a woman known as [...] "Mama Jane", received {{a great deal}} of media attention. Muthee's sermons have also been scrutinized, especially during a 2005 appearance at the Wasilla Assembly of God during which he prayed for Sarah Palin, asking God to protect her from witchcraft and for God to supply people and financial resources for her then-campaign for Alaska governor. [...] The Boston Herald described it as [...] "all smoke and no fire", pointing out that some religious experts believed that, in light of Muthee's cultural background, there was nothing <b>strange</b> <b>about</b> the prayer.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the summer}} of 1989 Guttermouth began {{performing}} in Huntington Beach and Orange County, building a small but enthusiastic local following. Their music was heavily influenced by the Los Angeles and Orange County punk rock scenes of the 1980s which included bands like the Adolescents, The Vandals, Social Distortion, Fear, the Descendents, Angry Samoans, Bad Religion and Black Flag. From these influences Guttermouth developed their own style of fast punk tempos with humorously sarcastic and offensive lyrics coupled with equally outrageous and offensive behavior, developing a reputation for chaotic live shows. In 1991 they were approached by local record label Dr. <b>Strange</b> <b>about</b> putting out an album, and entered Westbeach Recorders to record and release their first 7" [...] record, Puke. Later that year they released another 7", Balls, and finally their first LP, aptly titled Full Length LP.|$|E
2500|$|In 1879 Fahlberg, {{working with}} Remsen in a post-doctoral capacity, made an {{accidental}} discovery that changed Remsen's career. [...] Eating rolls at dinner {{after a long}} day in the lab researching coal tar derivatives, Fahlberg noticed that the rolls tasted initially sweet but then bitter. Since his wife tasted nothing <b>strange</b> <b>about</b> the rolls, Fahlberg tasted his fingers and noticed that the bitter taste was probably from one of the chemicals in his lab. The next day at his lab he tasted the chemicals that he had been working with the previous day and discovered that it was the oxidation of o-toluenesulfonamide he had tasted the previous evening. He named the substance saccharin and he and his research partner Remsen published their finding in 1880. Later Remsen became angry after Fahlberg, in patenting saccharin, claimed that he alone had discovered saccharin. Remsen had no interest in the commercial success of saccharin, from which Fahlberg profited, but he was incensed at the perceived dishonesty of not crediting him {{as the head of the}} laboratory.|$|E

2500|$|Japp asks Poirot to {{join him}} at a house in Bardsley Garden Mews where a Mrs Barbara Allen shot herself the {{previous}} evening – Guy Fawkes Night – the moment of death being disguised by the noise of fireworks. Once there they find that the doctor thinks there is something <b>strange</b> <b>about</b> {{the death of the}} fine lady, a young widow. Mrs Allen was found by a housemate, Miss Jane Plenderleith, who had been away in the country the previous night. The victim was locked in her room and was shot through the head with an automatic, the weapon being found in her hand. [...] The doctor however points out that the gun is in her right hand while the wound is above the left ear – an impossible position to shoot with the right hand. It looks as if this is a murder made to look like suicide – and by an unusually incompetent murderer with a very low estimation of the intelligence of police investigators. [...] They interview Miss Plenderleith and find out that Mrs Allen was engaged to be married to Charles Laverton-West, an up-and-coming young MP but, although the pistol was the dead lady's, she cannot think of a reason why she should use it to commit suicide.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Billington {{reviewing}} in The Times {{was much}} more favourable to the ITV coverage. He said they had [...] "seized the initiative" [...] off the BBC. [...] "In the past {{it has always been}} the BBC that has been ready to abandon its schedules to suit historic public events: yesterday, however, the traditional roles were reversed and it was the BBC that persevered with Dr. Finlay's Casebook and The Black and White Minstrel Show while independent television showed itself far more flexible and enterprising." [...] He praised Frost for the way he [...] "chaired the proceedings with his usual unflappable professionalism" [...] and Burnett for [...] "combining straight news with personal comment", though he said [...] "the combination of news and variety is more debatable. There is certainly something a bit <b>strange</b> <b>about</b> going straight from a discussion about the orbit of Luna 15 to hearing Cilla Black singing her latest recording. On balance, I think this type of juxtaposition is justified, if only because some point of rest is needed in a programme of this length. The danger is that the viewer will be so saturated with information that his responses will be blunted {{when it comes to the}} moments of real excitement: pop music, however, provides the necessary let-up and fulfills much the same function as comic relief in a five-act drama.|$|E
