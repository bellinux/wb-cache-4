This display of force was a farewell to Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who left behind a legacy of military modernisation and an emphasis on professionalism (Faridz 2014). From the podium Yudhoyono declared: We have witnessed together advancements that make us proud: our defence posture is increasingly strong, our heavy weaponry is increasingly comprehensive and modern, the capacity and professionalism of the TNI is increasingly heightened, and we have finished and completed the reform of the TNI. We are thankful {{for the last ten}} years, and we have developed strength and modernisation well (Rizki 2014). A few months earlier, on 1 July 2014, the anniversary of the founding of the Indonesian National Police (Polisi Republik Indonesia, Polri), the president spoke of his hopes to transform Indonesia's police into a ‘world-class’ force. Modernisation of equipment and technology was crucial to developing that professionalism. Apart from terrorism, he said, ‘your job is to bust criminals. Protect the community. That's it’ (Firdaus 2014). Professionalism through modernisation was the cornerstone of Yudhoyono's ten-year governance of the security sector. Military professionalism was a longstanding theme in the president's intellectual history. But what did he mean by it? In 1990, on the precipice of the New Order's long decline, Yudhoyono presented a paper on military professionalism to the Army Staff and Command College (Sekolah Staf dan Komando Angkatan Darat, Seskoad) (Yudhoyono 1990). In it he rejected the liberal preoccupation with civilian supremacy over the military as a Western import. He argued that officers of the Indonesian Armed Forces (Angkatan Bersenjata Republik Indonesia, ABRI) should be professional, not liberal-democratic, and that ABRI's professionalism did not limit the force to one neat category, ‘soldier’, ‘nation-builder’, ‘leader’ or ‘state functionary’. ABRI was all these things and as long as it adhered to professionalism, morality, security expertise, solidarity, leadership, unity and closeness to the people, then it would remain the only institution able to deliver security and stability amidst development. Honna (2003 : 77 – 9) described Yudhoyono's idea of professionalism as a catch-all concept directed against the threat of social change...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} construction of the Irish Traveller character in fiction. Traveller marginalisation has been perpetuated in literature through stereotypical representation and subjugation of their world-view. This thesis aims to investigate the predominant Irish Traveller stereotypes in art and fiction, and the strategies for innovative representations. This study is tripartite: discursive, creative and reflective. The discursive section provides an overview of Traveller culture and a history of relations between the group and the settled community in order to explore how representations have evolved for better or worse. Representations within photography, film and literature present an overview of the dominant depictions of Travellers in popular culture; these include the victim, the fool and the criminal. Depictions that engage the Traveller perspective or world-view are rare. Using a stylistics approach, three innovative representations, Bryan MacMahon 2 ̆ 7 s The Honey Spike, Peter Brady 2 ̆ 7 s Paveewhack and Tom Murphy 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> A <b>Whistle</b> in the Dark are analysed to reveal the choices these respective writers have made A particular focus is placed on the Travellers 2 ̆ 7 specific argot, Shelta, and the oral nature of their community. Section II of this thesis is the creative application of the best of these ideas in a draft of a novel entitled Run Over. The intention is to create a polyphonic chorus of voices, in which the Traveller voice is equal among many. Section III is a reflective essay, which chronicles the interaction of the critical and creative work throughout this Ph. D. The praxis orientation of this work fosters the interaction of critical and creative work, cultivating inquiry, awareness and innovation. 2017 - 05 - 2...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes an {{adaptive}} filter-based {{method for detection}} and frequency estimation of whistle calls, such as the calls of birds and marine mammals, which are typically analyzed in the time-frequency domain using a spectrogram. The approach taken here is based on adaptive notch filtering, which is an established technique for frequency tracking. For application to automatic whistle processing, methods for detection and improved frequency tracking through frequency crossings as well as interfering transients are developed and coupled to the frequency tracker. Background noise estimation and compensation is accomplished using order statistics and pre-whitening. Using simulated signals as well as recorded calls of marine mammals and a human whistled speech utterance, it is shown that the proposed method can detect more simultaneous whistles than two competing spectrogram-based methods while not reporting any false alarms on the example datasets. In one example, it extracts complete 1. 4 and 1. 8 <b>s</b> bottlenose dolphin <b>whistles</b> successfully through frequency crossings. The method performs detection and estimates frequency tracks even at high sweep rates. The algorithm is also shown to be effective on human whistled utterance...|$|R
40|$|Whistleblowing {{is not a}} new {{phenomenon}} but recent technological advances, which make corrupt behaviour difficult to hide, have exposed whistleblowingg as a burgeoning problem on several levels: international, national and local. Whistleblowing presents problems not only for the organisation which must deal with the offender, contain any damage to its reputation and manage the problems that enabled the corrupt behaviour in the first place; but it presents problems for the whistleblower. While ultimately an organisation may benefit from a whistleblower 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> action, the <b>whistle</b> blower 2 ̆ 7 s journey is rarely without sacrifices. Individual whistleblowers must call upon personal strengths to report misconduct despite probable adverse consequences. To explore an aspect of contemporary whistle blowing, this research relies on the theory of Organisational Citizenship Behaviour (OCB) which identifies five characteristics of whistleblowing behaviour: altruism, courtesy, sportsmanship, civic virtue and conscientiousness (Organ 1990, 1997). Van Dyne, Graham and Dienesch (1394) whose research tested OCB theory, argued that loyalty to the organisation was also an important characteristic. In a later study Paine and Organ (2000) concluded that in Australia. OCBs and loyalty to the organisation are negated by the Australian ethos of 2 ̆ 2 mateship 2 ̆ 2. These concepts are a springboard for the proposed research...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} how {{music has been}} treated by writers and critics as being {{at the heart of}} Afro-American cultural expression. Two elements crucial to black music [...] its improvisational nature and its vernacular appeal [...] have made it an inspiration to black writers. Genres of black music most often treated in the literature have been gospel, jazz, and blues. In all forms, music can provide a rich symbolic context for the writer, and in the three novels examined, music catalyzes the maturation of the youthful protagonists. These changes are discussed as comin(g) up stories, a black vernacular variation on the traditional Bildungsroman. ^ Chapter one assesses the intertextual occurrence of music as a point of reference or agent for change in a variety of Afro-American works. Chapters two through four each examine how individual authors view music as an expression of black culture and how, in largely autobiographical first novels, they use black musical genres to promote the maturation of the books 2 ̆ 7 protagonists. ^ James Baldwin 2 ̆ 7 s Go Tell It on the Mountain finds much drama in the songs and rituals of the sanctified church. The gospel service surrounds John Grimes on his fourteenth birthday and is a prominent force in the conversion that frees him from his father 2 ̆ 7 s sway. Baldwin also counterpoises a secular blues spirit to the gospel influences in several revelatory scenes. In Al Young 2 ̆ 7 s Snakes, a young orphan, MC, is initiated into sex, drugs, and music.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} to {{what extent}} modern genetics has influenced novelists to adopt a more deterministic view of human beings. It has been claimed that molecular biology, behavioural genetics and evolutionary psychology have challenged traditional ideas about humankind. My hypothesis is that if gene-centred disciplines {{changed the way we}} see ourselves, then this would have implications for the literary novel, a genre that depends greatly on representations of humans. In analysing how genetics was incorporated in contemporary British fiction, I try to uncover {{the ways in which the}} human characters deal with – or are constrained or empowered by – scientific products or concepts. In addition, I seek to understand what novelists know and think about human genetics, and whether they believe it influenced their stories. Attention is also paid to novelists’ relationship with scientists’ cognitive authority. Specifically, I am interested in whether experts and scientific knowledge were positioned hierarchically above lay audiences and other forms of knowledge. To answer those questions, extended semi-structured interviews and textual analysis were chosen as main research methods. Six literary novels were selected for analysis. This corpus consists of: A. <b>S.</b> Byatt’s A <b>Whistling</b> Woman, Carole Cadwalladr’s The Family Tree, Margaret Drabble’s The Peppered Moth, Maggie Gee’s The Ice People, Simon Mawer’s Mendel’s Dwarf and David Mitchell’s Cloud Atlas. The main conclusion of this project is that novelists are able to incorporate ideas about genetics in their texts without simply perpetuating reductionist discourses. Literary novels offer several advantages compared to the expository writing: they are a flexible literary form; deal imaginatively with the human experience; and effortlessly accommodate multiple perspectives, open-ended questions and complex ideas such as doubt and ambiguity. As such, this genre affords the opportunity to explore contemporary science as a provisional, contingent and socially-embedded endeavour. Imperial Users onl...|$|R
40|$|Whilst demons are {{no longer}} viewed as literal beings, as a metaphor the demon {{continues}} to trail ideas about doubt and truth, simulation and reality, into post- Enlightenment culture. This metaphor has been revitalised in a contemporary period that has seen {{the dominance of the}} cybernetic paradigm. Cybernetics has produced technologies of simulation, whilst the posthuman (a hybrid construction of the self emerging from cultural theory and technology) perceives the world as part of a circuit of other informational systems. In this thesis, illustrative films and literary fictions posit a connection between cybernetic epistemologies and metaphors of demonic possession, and contextualise these against postmodern thought and its narrative modes. Demons mark a return to pre-Enlightenment models of knowledge, so that demonic (dis) simulation can be seen to describe our encounters with artificial others and virtual worlds that reflect an uncertainly constituted and unstable self. By juxtaposing Renaissance notions of the demon with Donna Haraway's posthuman "cyborg," psychoanalytic demons with the robots of the science fiction film Forbidden Planet (1956), and Descartes' "deceiving demon" with Alan Turing's artificial intelligence test, I propose that the demon proves a fluid, multivalent trope that crosses historical and disciplinary boundaries. The demon raises epistemological questions about the relationship between reality, human psychology, and the representation of both in other modes, particularly narrative fictions. When this framework is applied to seminal science fiction (2001 : A Space Odyssey and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? [both 1968]), conventional readings of cyborgs as monstrous Others have to be revised. These fictions are engaged with cybernetic technologies with an epistemological rather than ontological concern, and consequently lend themselves to the kind of sceptical doubt about reality that characterises postmodern thought. Contrary to Descartes, who sees foundational truth through the deceptions of his "deceiving demon," later films like Blade Runner (1982) and The Matrix (1999) use the motif of cybernetic technologies to highlight the inescapability of the postmodern condition of the hyperreal. Finally, however, literary fictions like Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum (1988) and A. <b>S.</b> Byatťs A <b>Whistling</b> Woman (2002) and Possession (1990) draw attention to their narrative mechanisms through metafiction, and set the creation of literary meaning against computer-generated texts. Consequently, they defy both the determinism of cybernetic sciences, and the postmodern pretence that the "real" is irrecoverably evasive.

40|$|Animal bioacoustics is {{described}} as the study of sounds in non-human animals including acoustic communication, mechanisms of sound production, auditory function and anatomy, sonar, acoustic tracking, {{and the effects of}} anthropogenic (human-made) and environmental sounds on animals (Mellinger 2001). In the last decade, sounds produced by marine mammals have been studied in order to determine behavior, taxonomy, evolution, and many other characteristics of these animals. Marine mammals produce sounds in many different manners, and each sound produced is appropriate to a particular behavior or situation. Odontocetes or toothed whales exhibit two main types of sounds: clicks and whistles. The 2 ̆ 2 clicks 2 ̆ 2 are used to find food, to echolocate in their environment and for other important behavioral aspects. Whistles are used for basic communication, to describe a physical state, or to produce a distinctive sound particular to that individual (identification). This animal 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> series of <b>whistles</b> are distinct from any other member of the group; and are called 2 ̆ 2 signature whistles. 2 ̆ 2 A signature whistle distinguishes an animal from the others and provides a way for cetaceans to recognize and bond with others. Mysticetes or baleen whales produce many types of sound; including the grunt, the whistle or moan, pulse trains and blowhole sounds. These are used for different types of behavior than those of odontocetes. These sounds are produced to determine status, mating behavior, or pod location relative to other members of the species (not for basic communication). It has been determined that these sounds can change through seasons, within members of the group, sex, and location in the water column. Therefore, the understanding of the physiology of these animals and the sound production of the mysticetes is a crucial factor in helping with studies of behavior and identification. The in-depth study of different cetacean species 2 ̆ 7 sounds may deepen the understanding of the significance of sound produced by these animals and it can correlate the changes in sounds with body length, sex, behavior, and ecology. The search for the role of sound in the everyday lives of marine mammals is getting clearer with new technologies. As species and even individuals are identified, scientists get even closer to the meaning behind these sounds. One of the advantages of studying sound is that bioacoustics allows use to identify the animals more precisely and help with identification when the animals are not visible...|$|R
