5000|$|Although cosmetically and—more importantly—tonally accurate, {{there were}} several notable {{differences}} to be found (<b>solid-state</b> <b>rectifier,</b> printed circuit boards, ¼" [...] reverb/vibrato footswitch jack, 3-prong power cord). Fender used the original templates, molds and blueprints from the Oxford company archives to manufacture Oxford-style loudspeakers. The Fender '63 Reissue Vibroverb listed for $900 (US) when it was released in 1990.|$|E
5000|$|During {{this time}} the amplifier's output was rated at 85 watts into a 4-ohm speaker load. The circuit used is {{commonly}} known as the AB763 circuit. Fender Twin Reverb amplifiers use four output tubes, of the 6L6GC type. [...] They use six preamp tubes, consisting of four 7025/12AX7 types and two 12AT7 types. All Twin Reverbs feature a <b>solid-state</b> <b>rectifier.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Deluxe Reverb II was {{introduced}} that same year. Output on the amp was diminished to 20 watts and a <b>solid-state</b> <b>rectifier</b> was used. The tremolo circuit was removed. Gain, master volume, and presence controls were added. And the two channels were made switchable {{as opposed to}} the individual inputs on the Deluxe Reverb. The Deluxe Reverb II was effectively a completely different amplifier, and it was discontinued in 1986. This was the so-called [...] "Rivera-era".|$|E
50|$|One of {{the reasons}} why it was not {{introduced}} earlier was the lack of suitable small and lightweight control and rectification equipment before the development of <b>solid-state</b> <b>rectifiers</b> and related technology. Another reason was the increased clearance distances required where it ran under bridges and in tunnels, which would have required major civil engineering in order to provide the increased clearance to live parts.|$|R
50|$|As <b>solid-state</b> metal <b>rectifiers</b> became {{available}} for low-voltage rectification in the 1920s, mercury arc tubes became limited to higher voltage and especially high-power applications.|$|R
25|$|Once common until {{replaced}} by more compact and less costly silicon <b>solid-state</b> <b>rectifiers</b> in the 1970s, these units used stacks of oxide-coated metal plates and {{took advantage of}} the semiconductor properties of selenium or copper oxide. While selenium rectifiers were lighter in weight and used less power than comparable vacuum tube rectifiers, they had the disadvantage of finite life expectancy, increasing resistance with age, and were only suitable to use at low frequencies. Both selenium and copper oxide rectifiers have somewhat better tolerance of momentary voltage transients than silicon rectifiers.|$|R
5000|$|Around 1974 {{a master}} volume control with pull boost circuit and a modern-looking [...] "tailless"-style logo were added {{and two years}} later a 3-band EQ and an ultra linear solid state {{rectifier}} were introduced. The output was increased to 70 watts and in 2010 these were selling for around $1,500 to $1,900 (2011 Vintage Guitar Price Guide). The [...] "ultra-linear" [...] <b>solid-state</b> <b>rectifier</b> versions are perhaps the least desirable of the Pro Reverbs along with the later 1980-era blackface versions, with the latter being far superior designs to the previous, managing to retain the vintage sound with technologically superior reliability. The Pro Reverb was discontinued in 1982.|$|E
50|$|Developments {{in power}} systems {{continued}} beyond the nineteenth century. In 1936 the first experimental HVDC (high voltage direct current) line using mercury arc valves was built between Schenectady and Mechanicville, New York. HVDC {{had previously been}} achieved by series-connected direct current generators and motors (the Thury system) although this suffered from serious reliability issues. In 1957 Siemens demonstrated the first <b>solid-state</b> <b>rectifier,</b> {{but it was not}} until the early 1970s that solid-state devices became the standard in HVDC. In recent times, many important developments have come from extending innovations in the ICT field to the power engineering field. For example, the development of computers meant load flow studies could be run more efficiently allowing for much better planning of power systems. Advances in information technology and telecommunication also allowed for remote control of a power system's switchgear and generators.|$|E
50|$|Although the 1880s and 1890s were seminal {{decades in}} the field, {{developments}} in power engineering continued throughout the 20th and 21st century. In 1936 the first commercial high-voltage direct current (HVDC) line using mercury-arc valves was built between Schenectady and Mechanicville, New York. HVDC had previously been achieved by installing direct current generators in series (a system known as the Thury system) although this suffered from serious reliability issues. In 1957 Siemens demonstrated the first <b>solid-state</b> <b>rectifier</b> (solid-state rectifiers are now the standard for HVDC systems) however {{it was not until}} the early 1970s that this technology was used in commercial power systems. In 1959 Westinghouse demonstrated the first circuit breaker that used SF6 as the interrupting medium. SF6 is a far superior dielectric to air and, in recent times, its use has been extended to produce far more compact switching equipment (known as switchgear) and transformers. Many important developments also came from extending innovations in the ICT field to the power engineering field. For example, the development of computers meant load flow studies could be run more efficiently allowing for much better planning of power systems. Advances in information technology and telecommunication also allowed for much better remote control of the power system's switchgear and generators.|$|E
50|$|During the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, 25 Hz power was much more readily available from commercial electrical utilities. The vast majority of urban subway systems used 25 Hz power to supply their lineside rotary converters used to generate the DC voltage supplied to the trains. Since rotary converters work more efficiently with lower frequency supplies, 25 Hz was a common supply frequency for these machines. Rotary converters have been steadily replaced over the past 70 years with, at first, mercury arc rectifiers and more lately <b>solid-state</b> <b>rectifiers.</b> Thus, the need for special frequency power for urban traction has disappeared, along with the financial motivation for utilities to operate generators at these frequencies.|$|R
50|$|AC {{replaced}} DC in most {{applications and}} eventually the need for local DC substations diminished along {{with the need for}} rotary converters. Many DC customers converted to AC power, and on-site <b>solid-state</b> DC <b>rectifiers</b> were used to power the remaining DC equipment from the AC supply.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1920s, DC {{was derived}} using {{electronic}} valves (mercury arc rectifiers). In modern systems, high-voltage DC (HVDC) [...] "back-to-back" [...] stations are {{used instead of}} mechanical equipment to convert between different frequencies and phases of AC power and <b>solid-state</b> thyristor <b>rectifier</b> systems are used for conversion from AC power to DC traction power.|$|R
5000|$|At the 2010 Winter NAMM expo Vox {{introduced}} the Custom series; these models were updates to the 2004 Custom Classic series amplifiers and featured two channels (Normal and Top Boost) with two inputs {{for each channel}} (High and Low), more akin to the original AC30/4 layout released in 1958. It was available with either Greenback speakers (C2) or Alnico Blue Speakers (C2x), and was also available as the AC15. Later limited edition models include the AC30BL, a tygoon blue tolex with grey speaker cloth, an AC30C2RD with a red finish, an AC30C2-BRG a British Racing Green tolex finish with a grey speaker cloth and the AC30C2 Black Comet; featuring a patterned finish all are identical to the C2. The amp featured an option known as [...] "Jumping" [...] where the High-Normal channel could {{be linked to the}} Low-Top Boost channel with a patch lead, whilst the guitar is plugged into the High-Top Boost channel, allowing both channels to sound and create a fuller, thicker overdrive sound. The amp also featured a <b>solid-state</b> <b>rectifier</b> to increase reliability. Controls include a Normal volume, Top Boost Volume, Treble and Bass controls, Reverb Tone and Level controls, Tremolo Speed and Depth controls, a Tone Cut control (to add further control over the higher-frequencies), a Master Volume, and a Standby and Power Switch. A true bypass effects loop, extension cab output and external cab output were also included; as well as an input for the external foot switch (to control Reverb and Tremolo). The amps are produced in China. The amps were released to critical success, garnering awards such as Music Radar's [...] "Guitarist Choice" [...] award.|$|E
40|$|The {{status of}} the Small Community Solar Thermal Power Experiment is presented. Activities on the Phase 2 single/module {{development}} effort are presented, together with plans for the Phase 3 1 MWe demonstration plant. A description of the various subsystems and components is given with emphasis on the unmanned microprocessor based plant control subsystem. Latest performance figures are given for the 1 MWe plant, based on 56 power modules, each consisting of a 12 m low cost concentrator, a cavity receiver, a Rankine power conversion subsystem and a ground mounted <b>solid-state</b> <b>rectifier.</b> Overall plant efficiency at rated conditions is 15. 8 percent. Advanced glass concentrator designs yield 20 percent overall efficiencies...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{experiments}} {{provide evidence}} of intrinsic localized modes (ILMs) in the lattice dynamics of conventional 3 D materials. Here evidence that ILMs in uranium metal enhance the thermal conductivity is presented along with speculation on how thermal transport by ILMs {{might be used to}} improve a reported design for a <b>solid-state</b> thermal <b>rectifier.</b> Comment: 5 pages, 2 figures, Materials Research Society Symposium Proceedings, Spring Meeting in San Francisco, 200...|$|R
50|$|Unlike their <b>solid-state</b> equivalents, tube <b>rectifiers</b> require time to warm {{up before}} they can supply B+/HT voltages. This delay can protect rectifier-supplied vacuum tubes from cathode damage due to {{application}} of B+/HT voltages before the tubes have reached their correct operating temperature by the tube's built-in heater.|$|R
50|$|With over 100 inventions {{credited}} to him personally, {{one of the}} most important was the dry electrolytic aluminum capacitor, the <b>solid-state</b> magnesium/cupric sulfide <b>rectifier</b> (a device that converted regular household electric current for use in radios), and the vacuum tube relay, the quick heater vacuum tube, and the concept of a balanced-cell mercury battery.|$|R
40|$|Automatic voltage {{regulation}} {{is necessary for}} all power producing synchronous generators {{to ensure that the}} produced power have a constant and stable voltage level and to sustain grid stability. The aim of this thesis is to design and build an automatic voltage regulator for a synchronous generator. A six-phase permanent magnet alternator will be used to excite the rotor with solid-state relay controlled rotating bridge rectifier. The field current is regulated by a closed loop control system that is based on a programmable logic controller, PLC. Programing of the PLC is executed in the developing environment CoDeSys, IEC 61131 - 3, which is the international standard for programing PLC applications. Simulations for predicting the system behavior is done with a web based in-browser tool, circuitlab. com. The results show a good performance of the regulator and the closed loop system although there is room for improvement of the <b>solid-state</b> controlled <b>rectifier</b> system. ...|$|R
