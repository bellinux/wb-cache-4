5|$|In 2009, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) {{released}} {{the results of}} a five-year-long study (the Highway Serial Killings Initiative) investigating the unsolved murders of prostitutes, hitchhikers, and stranded motorists. Over 500 female victims have been compiled in a database, most of whom were killed or discarded at truck stops, hotels, and roadsides. The FBI has speculated that many of these victims were murdered by long-haul truck drivers, some of whom may be serial killers. Investigators speculate that the easy access to potential victims, mobility, and lack of supervision enjoyed by long-haul truck drivers have contributed to this phenomenon. The head of the initiative, Michael Harrigan, <b>says</b> <b>most</b> of the victims lead high-risk lifestyles (e.g., prostitution) which left them particularly vulnerable. In 2004, the FBI began investigating a string of murders in which the victims were found along the Interstate 40 corridor in Oklahoma and several other states, which sparked the creation of the Highway Serial Killings Initiative.|$|E

When it rains, it’s possible to sit on the patio and watch the water pour down without getting wet. Under a gravel border around the house, a concrete gutter channels the water into the cistern for irrigation. In hot weather, a terrace directly above the cistern is a little cooler than the surrounding area.|$|E

25|$|Historian and {{linguist}} Andrew Dalby <b>says</b> <b>most</b> {{references to}} butter in ancient Near Eastern texts should more correctly be translated as ghee. Ghee is {{mentioned in the}} Periplus of the Erythraean Sea as a typical trade article around the first century CE Arabian Sea, and Roman geographer Strabo describes it as a commodity of Arabia and Sudan. In India, ghee has been a symbol of purity and an offering to the gods—especially Agni, the Hindu god of fire—for more than 3000 years; references to ghee's sacred nature appear numerous times in the Rigveda, circa 1500–1200BCE. The tale of the child Krishna stealing butter remains a popular children's story in India today. Since India's prehistory, ghee has been both a staple food and used for ceremonial purposes, such as fueling holy lamps and funeral pyres.|$|E
500|$|Satin {{presents}} Radical Middle as {{a revised}} and evolved {{version of his}} New Age Politics book, {{rather than as a}} rejection of it. [...] Some observers had always seen him as a radical centrist. [...] As early as 1980, author Marilyn Ferguson identified him as part of what she called the [...] "Radical Center". [...] In 1987, culture critic Annie Gottlieb said Satin was trying to prompt the New Age and New Left to evolve into a [...] "New Center". [...] But the revisions Satin introduces are substantial. [...] Instead of defining politics as a means for creating the ideal society, as he did in New Age Politics, he defines radical middle politics as [...] "idealism without illusions"– more creative and future-oriented than politics-as-usual, but willing to face [...] "the hard facts on the ground". [...] Rather than arguing that change will be brought about by a third force, he <b>says</b> <b>most</b> Americans are already radical middle– [...] "we're very practical folks, and we're very idealistic and visionary as well." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{minority}} view among historians is {{that the}} Confederacy lost because, as E. Merton Coulter put it, [...] "people did not will hard enough and long enough to win." [...] Marxist historian Armstead Robinson agrees, pointing to a class conflict in the Confederates army between the slave owners and the larger number of non-owners. He argues that the non-owner soldiers grew embittered about fighting to preserve slavery, and fought less enthusiastically. He attributes the major Confederate defeats in 1863 at Vicksburg and Missionary Ridge to this class conflict. However, most historians reject the argument. James M. McPherson, after reading thousands of letters written by Confederate soldiers, found strong patriotism that continued to the end; they truly believed they were fighting for freedom and liberty. Even as the Confederacy was visibly collapsing in 1864–65, he <b>says</b> <b>most</b> Confederate soldiers were fighting hard. Historian Gary Gallagher cites General Sherman who in early 1864 commented, [...] "The devils {{seem to have a}} determination that cannot but be admired." [...] Despite their loss of slaves and wealth, with starvation looming, Sherman continued, [...] "yet I see no sign of let up—some few deserters—plenty tired of war, but the masses determined to fight it out." ...|$|E

2500|$|There is a {{scholarly}} {{consensus that the}} earliest Christian baptism was by immersion. Thomas Schreiner likewise states that [...] "Most scholars agree that immersion was practiced in the NT", identifying submersion as the form of immersion practiced. [...] Heyler <b>says</b> <b>most</b> New Testament scholars generally agree that Christian baptism in the New Testament era was by immersion. Everett Ferguson similarly speaks of [...] "general scholarly agreement" [...] that the baptism commanded by Jesus was immersion in water by dipping, {{in the form of}} a [...] "full bath". [...] He describes medieval depictions of Jesus standing in water while John poured water over him as a [...] "strange fantasy" [...] deriving from later church practice. [...] Di Berardino describes the baptism of the New Testament era as generally requiring total immersion, Tischler says that total immersion seems to have been most commonly used, and Lang says [...] "Baptism in the Bible was by immersion, that is, the person went fully under the waters". Sookey says it is [...] "almost certain" [...] that immersion was used. The Global Dictionary of Theology says that it is probable that immersion was the early church's normal mode of baptism, but that it was not seen as an important issue.|$|E

Less successful, however, was that energetic woman in another effort to mitigate the austerities of their earlier state. It occurred to her to utilize the softer accents of Don Caesar in the pronunciation of their family name, and privately had [...] "Mulrade" [...] take the place of Mulrady on her visiting card. [...] "It might be Spanish," [...] she argued with her husband. [...] "Lawyer Cole <b>says</b> <b>most</b> American names are corrupted, {{and how do you know}} that yours ain't?" [...] Mulrady, who would not swear that his ancestors came from Ireland to the Carolinas in '98, was helpless to refute the assertion. But the terrible Nemesis of an un-Spanish, American provincial speech avenged the orthographical outrage at once. When Mrs. Mulrady began to be addressed orally, as well as by letter, as [...] "Mrs. Mulraid," [...] and when simple amatory effusions to her daughter rhymed with [...] "lovely maid," [...] she promptly refused the original vowel. But she fondly clung to the Spanish courtesy which transformed her husband's baptismal name, and usually spoke of him--in his absence--as [...] "Don Alvino." [...] But in the presence of his short, square figure, his orange tawny hair, his twinkling gray eyes, and retrousse nose, even that dominant woman withheld his title. It was currently reported at Red Dog that a distinguished foreigner had one day approached Mulrady with the formula, [...] "I believe I have the honor of addressing Don Alvino Mulrady?"

But I do think it is not very grateful to have quite forgotten Mr. Winterfield, who has done so much for her, and who only asks to pass a few hours of his day innocently in her society. Perhaps, being a single woman, I write ignorantly about mothers and babies. But I have my feelings; and (though I never liked Mr. Romayne) I feel for you, sir--if you will forgive the familiarity. In my opinion this new craze about the baby will wear out. He is already a cause of difference of opinion. My good mistress, who possesses knowledge of the world, and a kind heart as well, advises that Mr. Romayne should be informed of {{the birth of}} a son and heir. Mrs. Eyrecourt <b>says,</b> <b>most</b> truly, that the hateful old priest will get possession of Mr. Romayne's property, to the prejudice of the child, unless steps are taken to shame him into doing justice to his own son. But Mrs. Romayne is as proud as Lucifer; she will not hear of making the first advances, as she calls it. 'The man who has deserted me,' she says, 'has no heart to be touched either by wife or child.' My mistress does not agree with her. There have been hard words already, and the nice old French gentleman and his wife try to make peace. You will smile when I tell you that they offer sugar-plums as a sort of composing gift. My mistress accepts the gift, and has been to the theater at Paris, with Monsieur and Madame Villeray more than once already. To conclude, sir, if I might venture to advise you, I should recommend trying the effect on Mrs. R. of absence and silence." ...|$|E

60|$|November 29.--A {{letter from}} Southey, malcontent about Murray having {{accomplished}} {{the change in}} the Quarterly without speaking to him, and quoting the twaddle of some old woman, male or female, about Lockhart's earlier jeux d'esprit, but concluding most kindly that in regard to my daughter and me he did not mean to withdraw. That he has done yeoman's service to the Review is certain, with his genius, his universal reading, his powers of regular industry, and at the outset a name which, though less generally popular than it deserves, is still too respectable to be withdrawn without injury. I could not in reply point out to him what is the truth, that his rigid Toryism and High Church prejudices rendered him an unsafe counsellor in a matter where the spirit of the age must be consulted; but I pointed out to him what I am sure is true, that Murray, apprehensive of his displeasure, had not ventured to write to him out of mere timidity and not from any [intention to offend]. I treated [lightly] his old woman's apprehensions and cautions, and all that gossip about friends and enemies, to which a splendid number or two will be a sufficient answer, and I accepted with due acknowledgment his proposal of continued support. I cannot say I was afraid of his withdrawing. Lockhart will have hard words with him, for, great as Southey's powers are, he has not the art to make them work popularly; he is often diffuse, and frequently sets much value on minute and unimportant facts, and useless pieces of abstruse knowledge. Living too exclusively in a circle where he is idolised both for his genius and the excellence of his disposition, he has acquired strong prejudices, though all of an upright and honourable cast. He rides his High Church hobby too hard, and it will not do to run a tilt upon it against all the world. Gifford used to crop his articles considerably, and they bear mark of it, being sometimes décousues. Southey said that Gifford cut out his middle joints. When John comes to use the carving-knife I fear Dr. Southey will not be so tractable. Nous verrons. I will not show Southey's letter to Lockhart, for there is to him personally no friendly tone, and it would startle the Hidalgo's pride. It is to be wished they may draw kindly together. Southey <b>says</b> <b>most</b> truly that even those who most undervalue his reputation would, were he to withdraw from the Review, exaggerate the loss it would thereby sustain. The bottom of all these feuds, though not named, is Blackwood's Magazine; all the squibs of which, which have sometimes exploded among the Lakers, Lockhart is rendered accountable for. He must now exert himself at once with spirit and prudence.[46] He has good backing--Canning, Bishop Blomfield, Gifford, Wright, Croker, Will Rose,--and is there not besides the Douglas?[47] An excellent plot, excellent friends, and full of preparations? It was no plot of my making, I am sure, yet men will say and believe that [it was], though I never heard a word of the matter till first a hint from Wright, and then the formal proposal of Murray to Lockhart announced. I believe Canning and Charles Ellis were the prime movers. I'll puzzle my brains no more about it.|$|E
