He published his account in an 1817 {{volume of the}} Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, and named the new species Raja say in honor of Thomas <b>Say,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> founding members of the Academy. The species {{was moved to the}} genus Dasyatis by subsequent authors. In 1841, German biologists Johannes Peter Müller and Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle erroneously gave the specific epithet as sayi in their Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen, which thereafter became the typical spelling used in literature. Recently, there has been a push to use the correct original spelling again, though it has also been proposed that the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) officially emend the spelling to sayi, for consistency with previous usage.|$|E
2500|$|Profitability may be {{observed}} to fall, {{along with other}} variables, but that says nothing about the true interrelationship of the determinants which explain why it falls. In fact, the orthodox classical revolutionary Marxist Paul Mattick even claimed [...] "that the conditions both of the crisis and its solution are so complex that they cannot be empirically determined. When the crisis will break out, its extent, and its duration cannot be predicted; only {{that there will be}} a crisis can be expected with certainty." [...] Causal chains could be traced out in all sorts of directions, using the same econometric evidence. Thus, to ascertain what independent role profitability actually plays in economic development requires a much more precise analysis than Marxists have ever provided. Marxists simply assumed the centrality of profitability in capitalist production, but they failed to prove that falling profitability is the root cause of all crises, rather than (<b>say)</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> effects that are visible in crises.|$|E
2500|$|Bahá'u'lláh wrote three {{obligatory}} prayers — the short, {{the medium}} {{and the long}} — and Bahá'ís are free to choose to <b>say</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three each day. [...] The short and the medium prayer have to be said at specific times; the short has to be said once between noon and sunset and the medium has to be said three times daily: once between dawn and noon, once between noon and sunset and once between sunset and two hours after sunset. The long prayer can be said {{at any time in}} the day. The medium and long prayers also include movements and gestures during the prayers, which are themselves obligatory except when a person is physically incapable of performing them. Shoghi Effendi has written that the motions and gestures are symbolic and are used to help maintain concentration during the prayers. Furthermore, the obligatory prayer is to be preceded by ablutions, the cleaning of the hands and face, and one has to face the Qiblih, which is the Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh.|$|E
