50|$|In the UK The Conference of Drama Schools {{comprises}} Britain’s 22 leading Drama Schools. CDS {{exists in}} order to strengthen {{the voice of the}} member schools, to set and maintain the highest standards of training within the vocational drama sector, and {{to make it easier for}} prospective students to understand the range of courses on offer and the application process. Founded in 1969, the 22 member schools offer courses in Acting, Musical Theatre, Directing and Technical Theatre training. Graduates of CDS courses are currently working on stage, in front of the camera and behind the scenes in theatres and studios across Britain. In September 2016, Midlands Academy of Musical Theatre opened in Birmingham. Offering West End quality training in Musical Theatre to students aged 18+, and with the same or better opportunities as many London drama schools, they offer a regional option for prospective drama school students. In 2012 it was merged with the National Council for Drama Training to create a <b>single</b> <b>national</b> <b>authority</b> Drama UK responsible for both the provision of Drama Training and accreditation of official courses. In 2017 Drama UK was replaced by the Federation of Drama Schools.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a review of}} the design and experience of risk-based pension fund supervision in several countries that have been leaders in the development of these methods. The utilization of risk-based methods originates primarily in the supervision of banks. In recent years it has increasingly been extended to other types of financial intermediaries including pension funds and insurers. The trend toward risk-based supervision of pensions is closely associated with movement toward the integration of pension supervision with that of banking and other financial services into a <b>single</b> <b>national</b> <b>authority.</b> Although similar in concept to the techniques developed in banking, the application to pension funds has required modifications, particularly for defined contribution funds that transfer investment risk to fund members. The countries examined provide a range of experiences that illustrate both the diversity of pension systems and approaches to risk-based supervision, but also a commonality of the focus on sound risk management and effective supervisory outcomes. The paper {{provides a}} description of pension supervision in Australia, Denmark, Mexico and the Netherlands, and an initial evaluation of the results achieved in relation to the underlying objectives.

40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} the {{response}} from the United States government on new challenges brought by the public video surveillance, in particular the privacy threat. Regarding regulating public video surveillance, the United States has gone on a different path, either from Britain with its similar political system or from China with a totally different one. The {{three branches of government}} in the U. S. are deadlocked and unable to take any meaningful actions. The Supreme Court, which is in a strong position to set national and uniform standards for privacy protection, has not found a way to break away from its own precedents. The legislative branch can do little on the national level regulations due to federalism and the distribution of law enforcement activities {{at the state and local}} level. Local legislative efforts might be helpful, but the process in each place will be complicated by concerns about public security, the interests of industry, and politicians’ imperative to take visible actions like video surveillance to fight against crimes and protect people, especially in the post- 9 / 11 context. The executive branch might be the weakest point in the deadlock because it already bears responsibility for resolving tensions between privacy and safety. In the absence of action by the judicial and the legislative branches, self-restraint by the executive branch has become crucial in determining the actual privacy protection, however, the possibility of abuse by the executive branch may increase at the same time. Also, the United States’ local governments are not accountable to a <b>single</b> <b>national</b> <b>authority.</b> They must be accountable to the people. This thesis concludes that the public participation is the key to breaking through the deadlock in light of the democratic political structure in the United States...|$|E
40|$|Background and Importance: {{comparative}} evidence generated using systematic {{reviews and}} meta-analyses can {{form the basis}} of high quality prescribing decisions in clinical practice. Such evidence is imperative when choosing a first-line treatment among multiple alternatives, particularly in the United States where there is no <b>single</b> <b>national</b> <b>authority</b> responsible for providing practice guidelines for prescribers. Objective: Using cholesterol-lowering statins as a case study, this thesis set out to evaluate the comparative clinical benefits and harms of statins for the prevention of coronary heart disease. Novelty and Empirical Contribution: The empirical work presented in this thesis was based on a systematic review and network meta-analysis, for the first time combining the placebo-controlled and active-comparator trials of statins. Using 184 randomized trials including 260, 630 individuals with or without cardiovascular disease, this thesis makes four major contributions to the literature on the comparative effectiveness and safety of statins, showing the following:(1) cholesterol-lowering effects of statins are less pronounced than suggested by the previous reviews; (2) statins potentially differ in terms of their comparative effects on clinically meaningful benefit outcomes, which are not fully explained by their cholesterol-lowering effects;(3) harms associated with statins are rare; still, some statins are safer than others; and (4) unlike previous findings in the literature, {{there is no evidence of}} industry sponsorship bias affecting the trials of statins. Implications for Clinical Practice: Although there are statistically detectable and clinically relevant differences among individual statins, the empirical work presented in this thesis does not conclusively identify a clear winner among statins that should be favored in clinical practice. Future&Research Directions: The potential mechanisms underlying the observed differences between individual statins should be investigated in future studies. Policy Relevance: The findings presented in this thesis suggest that statin prescribing patterns over the past decade – and in particular atorvastatin’s exceptional sales performance despite its equivalence to simvastatin – are not supported by the current best evidence. A proposed policy option is to raise the bar for market entry of new drugs by requiring comparative evidence at the time of approval decisions. Network meta-analysis methods can be used at the United States Food and Drug Administration setting, thereby making comparative evidence available before prescribing patterns are established...|$|E
40|$|TOWARDS THE END OF GEOGRAPHY? A CASE STUDY OF THE INTERNATIONALIZATION OF THE NORWEGIAN BANCING SECTOR This {{study focused}} on the {{internationalization}} of the Norwegian banking sector. The background for the study was the liberalization process of the Norwegian regulatory framework that has been taking place {{for more than a}} decade and that recently culminated with the ratification of the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement. The EEA implied that foreign owned banks could for the first time be organized as branches in Norway and that these branches could be under home country control, and not host country control as previously. Thus branches of foreign banks operating in Norway could therefore escape the implications of regulatory differences between Norway and other EEA Member States, since they are under foreign country supervision. In accordance with the these changes, this study addressed whether an End of geography scenario was occurring in the Norwegian financial system. Based on an understanding that the end of geography scenario requires both an internationalized market and an internationalized regulatory framework, the main argument of the study was that the Norwegian banking sector does not fulfill these conditions. In particular, the study defined the main dependent variable, economic internationalization, as activities of resource allocation that transcend the jurisdiction of a <b>single</b> <b>national</b> <b>authority.</b> This variable was divided into two subunits, government regulations and the national market itself, which were discussed in Chapters 3 and 4, respectively with regard to the degree of internationalization, and it was argued that there is an asymmetric situation in the Norwegian banking sector. On the one hand, the Norwegian government regulation has become so internationalized that the regulatory barriers a foreign entrant faces are minuscule. On the other hand, the market itself continues to have an overwhelming national profile. Moreover, as long as foreign penetration of the Norwegian banking market remains low, government regulations will remain disproportionately internationalized. Chapter 5 and 6 were devoted to analyzing the reasons for this asymmetrical situation. Chapter 5 discussed the internationalization processes of regulatory framework of banking. Norway's internationalization of regulations were described in terms of an institutional reproduction of the liberal domestic regime at the international level. The main argument was that this can be described as a "path dependent development" achieved through the mechanism of reciprocity. Specifically, it was argued that eertain attributes of the regional internationalization proeess (the adoption of the EEA) and the global proeess (the GATS), have eonditioned Norwegian banking regulations eoncessions. It was shown that the eoncept of reeiprocity is engraved in both structural and eonduet regulations, in the forms of reeiproeal market aeeess and natlonal treatment measures, respectively. These attributes explain the GATS' failuI-e to have an significant impact on Norwegian banking regulations, as exemplified by Norweglan Schedule of Speciiic Commitments. In eontrast, the discussion of the adoption the EEA showed that both the First and Seeond Banking Directives have significantly contributed to the internationalization of the Norwegian regulatory framework. In faet, by ratifying this treaty, the Norwegian banking regulåtion was liberalized to such an extent that it in fact placed foreign banks at an competitive advantage compared with their Norwegian eompetitors. Chapter 6 discussed the reasons for the low penetration of foreign banks in the Norwegian banking market. By employing Dunning's eclectic OLI paradigm, the different factors explaining foreign investment were grour) ed into three categories, or so-called "adv. lntagcs": Locational-, Ownership and Internalization specific. The basie argument presented is that the small market size seem to have an negativc effect on FDI (locational advantage), there are some indications of "follow your client" hypotheses (ownership advantage), and the theoretical and empirical findings of economes of scope and scale in baking are inconclusive (internationalization advantage). In conclusion thcrefore, the Norwegian banking seetor does not fulfill the conditions of an End of geography scenario. The diserepaney between an Internationalized regulatory framework and an enduring national profile of the Norwegian banking market eontinues despite more than a decade of liberalization of the government rezulations...|$|E

30|$|Since one of {{the most}} {{important}} roles of ocean alliances is to provide value by offering breadth and depth of trade lane coverage that customers demand without having to supply all of capacity themselves, it is crucial to investigate how customers can perceive the value of such alliances. This paper examines the current status of alliances and how carriers can possibly differentiate their services using transparent standardization measures to create value in the global marketplace. We suggest a simple standard performance measurement model that could be used to benchmark service delivery. Old systems of carrier competition could evolve to greater cooperation and coordination with ports and downstream logistics partners by developing standard-setting processes for sharing information and classifying cargos for handling, while retaining specific service delivery structures to provide value to customers. This is not a new concept. Examples of port/carrier information sharing include common port boards (Haropa- between Le Havre, Rouen and Paris, France), <b>single</b> <b>national</b> port <b>authorities</b> (Transnet <b>National</b> Port <b>Authority</b> in South Africa) and multi-country (Northern Corridor dashboard linking the port of Mombasa, Kenya with markets in Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi as well as southern Sudan and northern Tanzania). It can be shaped through public and private coordination (Notteboom and Rodrique, 2012). Cooperation in service standard-setting, abetted by transparent information flows, can allow segmented handling of cargo by service requirement instead of by contract, and improve reliability to the level required in each supply chain.|$|R

40|$|With the {{establishment}} of the Directorate of Special Operations (Scorpions), the Asset Forfeiture Unit (AFU), the Special Investigating Unit (SIU) and the Departmental Investigating Unit (DIU), questions were asked as to whether this is a creation of new units of the Police Service. These questions were exaggerated {{by the fact that the}} media uses the term "Scorpions" whenever the Scorpions, the AFU, SIU and the DIU perform their functions. South African legislation that governs organised crime does not demarcate activities to be dealt with by the SAPS, AFU, DIU, Scorpions and the SIU. The Constitution of South Africa lays down the objects of the police, but it is silent about the objectives of the Scorpions, AFU, SIU, DIU and other investigative institutions except that it only mentions the creation of a <b>single</b> <b>National</b> Prosecuting <b>Authority</b> (NPA). A literature study was used as the basis for this study. In addition, unstructured interviews and observation were used to gather evidence from the relevant stakeholders. An analysis of the SAPS Detective Service, the Special Investigating Unit (SIU), the Scorpions, the Departmental Investigating Unit (DIU) of the Department of Correctional Services and the Asset Forfeiture Unit (AFU), was done in order to establish the overlapping of functions. Indeed, overlapping was discovered between the Scorpions and the SAPS Detective Service, the AFU and the SIU, as well as between the SAPS and the DIU.
