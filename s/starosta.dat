5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2009, <b>Starosta</b> was {{unveiled}} as one of ten new signings made by Colin Todd at League Two side Darlington following their spell in administration. With the club still in financial difficulty however, he left by mutual consent before the season even started as Darlington tried to cut the wage bill. <b>Starosta</b> then spent a spell with Conference North side Alfreton Town, before, seeking a new club, he took up an offer from Australian Victorian Premier League side Dandenong Thunder, where he played on non-contract terms for a period, but soon left citing the poor quality of football on offer. <b>Starosta</b> returned to the UK and signed a short term deal with Frickley Athletic of the Northern Premier League in March 2011, but failed to make an appearance for the club.|$|E
5|$|<b>Starosta</b> {{started his}} club career with Sheffield United {{and had a}} spell in early 2006 on work {{experience}} with non-league Tamworth. He signed a new two-year contract with Sheffield United in May 2007, before joining Brentford in a five-month loan deal in August 2007 after impressing in two pre-season friendlies. <b>Starosta</b> played 23 games in all competitions for Brentford but was sent off during his last game for the club, a Boxing Day fixture against Wycombe Wanderers.

5|$|Ben Mark <b>Starosta</b> (born 7 January 1987) is a footballer {{who last}} played for Nuneaton Town. Born in Sheffield, England {{he started his}} career at his {{hometown}} club Sheffield United, although he never broke through into the first team. He was loaned {{to a number of}} clubs, both in England and Poland, while at United before eventually being released in 2009. After an aborted spell at Darlington he spent a period at Dandenong Thunder in Australia on non-contract terms before signing for Miedź Legnica in 2011. <b>Starosta</b> then spent a year at United Football League side Global in the Philippines. He has also played for the Polish national U-20 team, qualifying as he holds a Polish passport through his family.|$|E

5|$|<b>Starosta</b> {{qualified}} {{to play for}} Poland through his grandfather who moved to England from Poland after the Second World War. He received his Polish passport in early 2007 and was called up to the Poland squad for the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup. He started all four games, including the 1–0 defeat of Brazil on 30 June.|$|E
5|$|<b>Starosta</b> {{returned}} to Sheffield United {{at the end}} of the season, but he moved back to League Two when he joined Aldershot Town on a one-month loan deal for the start of the 2008–09 season, with a view to a permanent transfer. He made his Aldershot debut in Town's game against Accrington Stanley at the start of the season, and played four games during his loan spell. With a permanent deal with Aldershot not materialising, <b>Starosta</b> instead joined Polish side Lechia Gdańsk on a six-month loan deal in September 2008. He {{returned to}} Sheffield United in February 2009 having played eleven times for Gdańsk but was released {{at the end of}} the season as the Blades cut back their squad.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Poland Sobieski {{and his brother}} came to Zamość, {{which at the time}} was being besieged by Cossacks. In 1648, 1649 and 1650 Sobieski was elected a member of the parliament (sejm walny) of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. In 1649 he was among the electors who voted for John II Casimir as King of Poland. Then, as a head of a chorągiew husarska (military unit formed by Hussars) of 100 horse, the young <b>starosta</b> joined the army of Jeremi Wiśniowiecki.|$|E
50|$|With time, the wojskis {{responsibilities}} {{were taken}} over by <b>starostas,</b> and wojski became an honorary district office in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.|$|R
50|$|Families of <b>Starostas</b> often {{wanted to}} unlawfully keep the royal properties, {{and that led}} to common abuses of law (see {{following}} sections).|$|R
50|$|The first widely {{recognized}} hetman of Zaporizhia was Dmytro Vyshnevetsky, however later several Polish <b>starostas</b> {{were added to}} the Hetman registry such as Lyantskoronsky and Dashkevych who also led their own cossack formations. According to Mykola Hrushevsky they were not really considered as hetman, at least by their contemporaries. Among other such <b>starostas</b> were Karpo Maslo from Cherkasy, Yatsko Bilous (Pereyaslav), Andrushko (Bratslav), and many others. Even Princes Konstanty Ostrogski and Bohdan Hlinski were conducting Cossack raids on Tatar uluses (districts).|$|R
5|$|Along {{with his}} brother John, {{beginning}} in 1640, Sobieski studied at the Nowodworski College in Kraków. On 29 April 1642 Sobieski made a speech on funeral of Jakub Zadzik, bishop of Kraków. The next year, on 2 June 1643, Sobieski made a speech where he thanked absent Władysław IV for everything he had done for Nodworski College. Two months earlier, in April 1643, Marek and John Sobieski began studies at Kraków Academy. In 1644 Sobieski became <b>Starosta</b> of Krasnystaw.|$|E
5|$|For {{self-governance}} purposes, {{the city}} is divided into 17 boroughs, {{each of which has}} its own mayor (<b>starosta)</b> and council. The number of councillors in each depends on the size and population of the borough. Each of the boroughs coincides with the city's 20 cadastral areas, except for two cases: Nové Mesto is further divided into the Nové Mesto and Vinohrady cadastral areas and Ružinov is divided into Ružinov, Nivy and Trnávka. Further unofficial division recognizes additional quarters and localities.|$|E
5|$|Marek Sobieski (24 May 1628 – 3 June 1652) was a Polish noble (szlachcic), <b>starosta</b> (tenant of the Crown lands) of Krasnystaw and Jaworów, {{older brother}} of King John III Sobieski of Poland. He {{graduated}} from Nowodworski College in Kraków and Kraków Academy, then traveled and studied in Western Europe. After returning to Poland in 1648 he {{fought against the}} Cossacks and Tatars at Zbaraż and Beresteczko. He was taken captive by Tatars in 1652 and then killed by Cossacks.|$|E
40|$|This study examines, via a {{replication}} study, Chen and <b>Starosta’s</b> Model of Intercultural Sensitivity {{which is}} {{developed in the}} USA context. Although an earlier attempt to reproduce the model in Germany has been successful, the present replication study does not reach the same result based on German and US-American sample. Consequently, the intercultural validity of Chen and <b>Starosta’s</b> Model becomes doubtful for the time being, and which demands more close examinations in future research. Despite enormous set-backs of the worldwide economy since 2002, international business will increase in the long term. Consequently, {{there is a growing}} need of interculturally competent personnel especially in the areas of marketing and communication which strongly demand culturally sensitive ability. As a significant dimension of intercultural competence, intercultural sensitivity has long been emphasized in business management. Among the studies, Chen and <b>Starosta’s</b> (2000) Model of Intercultural Sensitivity is one of the models tested in different cultures. In...|$|R

50|$|Volost was {{governed by}} volost {{administration}} (волостное правление, volostnoye pravleniye), {{which consisted of}} the electable chief of volost (volostnoy starshina), chiefs of villages (village <b>starostas)</b> and other officials electable by the Volost Assembly (волостной сход, volostnoy skhod).|$|R
5|$|Although Koniecpolski had a stutter, {{when he was}} 15, {{through his}} father's {{influence}} in the royal court, he secured an appointment as <b>starosta</b> (mayor) of Wieluń. In 1603 he began studying at the Kraków Academy, and after several years {{he was sent to}} the royal court by his father so that he could continue his education in a more practical fashion. He is believed to have stayed there a year or two. He may also have undertaken a tour of Western Europe for several months, spending the majority of his time in France before returning to his family's estates.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2011 <b>Starosta</b> {{returned}} to Poland and signed a one-year deal for II liga side Miedź Legnica with the option of extending the deal for another two seasons. After a slow start he broke into the first team in August, appearing as a second-half substitute {{in a game against}} Bytovia Bytów. Establishing himself in the first team he played regularly through the season, making nineteen appearances as Miedź gained promotion to I liga. Miedź took up the option of extending his deal for him to remain with the club for the new season, however he subsequently left Legnica after the club cancelled his contract by mutual consent.|$|E
5|$|McCall {{had also}} been busy in the {{transfer}} market during January, with the trio of Ben <b>Starosta,</b> Scott Loach and TJ Moncur all arriving on loan. Bullock made his loan permanent and signed an 18-month contract, and David Brown signed after impressing on a trial. Five players also left Valley Parade on loan deals during January, with Craig Bentham joining Farsley Celtic, Luke Medley joining Cambridge City, Sean Taylforth and Luke Morgan both going to Droylsden, and Simon Ainge joining Halifax Town. Goalkeeper Donovan Ricketts was also expected to leave but his transfer to Queens Park Rangers collapsed after the Home Office rejected his application for a work permit.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Starostas</b> resided at Witebsk and Orsza, while local sejmiks {{took place}} in both towns. Altogether, Witebsk Voivodeship elected four deputies to the Sejm - two from each county. After the first partition, the sejmiks were moved {{to the town of}} Cholopienicze, located in Minsk Voivodeship”.|$|R
50|$|The {{voivodeship}} had {{the area}} of 162 sq. miles, with four counties. When in 1396 the Wieluń Land returned to Poland, it became part of Sieradz Voivodeship, which {{increased the number of}} counties to six. In the mid-16th century, the voivodeship (without the Land of Wieluń) had 127 Roman Catholic parishes, 29 towns and 938 villages, while the Land of Wieluń had 67 parishes, 13 towns and 182 villages. Sieradz Voivodeship had five senators: the Voivode of Sieradz, the Castellan of Sieradz, and the Castellans of Rozprza, Spycimierz and Konary. Main <b>starostas</b> resided in Sieradz and Piotrków Trybunalski, there also were <b>starostas</b> at Radomsko, Szadek, Tuszyn, Klonowa, Warta and other locations. The sejmiks at Szadek elected four deputies to the Sejm, and two deputies to the Greater Poland Tribunal in Piotrków Trybunalski.|$|R
50|$|Members of {{the family}} were voivodes of Inowrocław, Brześć Kujawski, Poznań, Kalisz, <b>starostas</b> of Kujawy, Pomorze and Wielkopolska, as well as bishops of Chełm. After the Thirteen Years' War many of them also served at the court of King of Poland which allowed them to amass {{considerable}} land and wealth.|$|R
5|$|Stanisław Koniecpolski (1591 – 11 March, 1646) was a Polish {{military}} commander, {{regarded as}} one of the most talented and capable in the history of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. He was also a magnate, a royal official (<b>starosta),</b> a castellan, a member of the Polish nobility (szlachta), and the voivode (governor) of Sandomierz from 1625 until his death. He led many successful military campaigns against rebelling Cossacks and invading Tatars. From 1618 he held the rank of Field Crown Hetman before becoming the Grand Crown Hetman, the military commander second only to the King, in 1632.|$|E
5|$|The castle was {{outdated}} {{but remained}} {{vital to the}} defense of Kamianets and nearby trade routes; as a result, the voivode of Kraków, Spytek of Melsztyn, began modernizing the complex {{at the turn of the}} 15th century. During the reconstruction, the old towers were renovated and ten new towers were added. A century and a half later, the castle was updated again, this time by military engineer and architect , who built the New Western and Eastern Towers, the castle's eastern wall and an underground gallery, as well as the Full Gates and housing for the town's <b>starosta</b> community.|$|E
5|$|Stansfield {{had long}} felt {{uncomfortable with the}} idea of medical {{officers}} marrying. Louise Hind, in Gender and Class in English Asylums, 1890–1914, hints that this might have been the result of misogynist tendencies, although Hubert Bond, his obituary-writer and former colleague, preemptively defended him against these claims. Stansfield nevertheless married twice; firstly, in 1908 to Mary Caroline (died 1926), a daughter of the Hon. James Dever, a Canadian senator from St John's, Newfoundland. After her death, he married (in 1929) Marie, second daughter of Alexander Effremoff, of Moscow; he had met her in Paris, where she had been living in exile after the Russian Revolution. There were no children from either marriage, but he worked with the scouting movement, and served as President of the North Central Kent Boys' Scouts Association. He was a fond rose-grower and it was the gardens at Southmead in Wimbledon which attracted him and his first wife to the house; they lived there for many years. He retired to Castello Devachan in Sanremo, Italy, with his second wife, before going to Paris to seek treatment for an illness; he died there on 19 February 1939. His widow remained at the Castello in Sanremo until her death in 1973, spending her last 21 years as <b>starosta</b> of the Russian Orthodox parish community there.|$|E
