Although China has not made commitments about the market access and national treatment of cross-border supply in <b>Schedule</b> <b>of</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Commitments</b> on Services, the basic conditions of network education development in China have been met. The Chinese government should formulate strategies {{for the development of}} cross-border network education and take relevant measures to implement them.

40|$|The South African Government {{publicly}} {{announced its}} intention to table the Regulation of Land Holdings Bill in Parliament soon, {{as part of their}} land reform priority. This potential new law aims to prohibit foreign ownership of agricultural land and to place ceilings on the size of agricultural land that citizens and foreigners may own. Foreigners will be allowed to conclude long term leases. Some parties most likely to be affected by this proposed new Bill are South Africa's fellow WTO Members in services trade and investors from its BIT partner countries. As a WTO Member and BIT partner, SA undertook various contractual obligations and commitments. The primary objective of this study is therefore to determine whether, by promulgating the proposed Bill, South Africa might be violating any of these obligations or commitments. This is done by considering firstly the policy and constitutional background of the Bill in light of the General and Specific GATS commitments such as the MFN, Transparency, National Treatment and Market Access Commitments. The outcome of this analysis shows that South Africa may violate its National Treatment and Market Access Specific Commitments by imposing the ban on foreign ownership of agricultural land. This is because those foreign services providers intending to own (as opposed to leasing) agricultural land to establish commercial presence in South Africa, will be prohibited from doing so - despite South Africa's GATS <b>Schedule</b> <b>of</b> <b>Specific</b> <b>Commitments</b> not indicating any such land ownership restrictions either horizontally or sector-specifically. Examples of affected service sectors are the Tourism, Manufacturing and Construction sectors. It is then concluded that (i) South Africa could potentially raise the public order General Exception against any possible violation claims; but (ii) that South Africa should in the alternative, rather consider modifying or withdrawing some of its GATS Commitments. The protections which South Africa's BITs provide are then analysed in light of what is publicly known about the proposed Bill. It is concluded, for example, that the restriction of the property rights of existing foreign owners of agricultural land in South Africa by restricting their rights to dispose of their land to South Africans only – may constitute indirect expropriation for which they should be compensated in terms of relevant BITs. Although the country's investment policy vis a vis BIT has changed leading to the termination of, for example, some European-South African BITs, these agreements all contain sunset clauses opening up the country for potential investor-state arbitration claims for up to 20 years. The thesis concludes with the recommendation that South Africa carefully considers the implications of potential claims from its WTO and BIT partners and in also, other alternative land reform options...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe {{transport}} sector {{is critical to}} the performance of various sectors of the economy both trade in goods and services hinges on an efficient and reliable transport services sector. South Africa has undertaken limited commitments under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in the {{transport sector}}. South Africa's transport sector in general is controlled by the government through state owned firms. The transport sector is competitive relative to Africa, however, relative to developed economies, the transport sector lags behind in terms of efficiency and cost (DBSA, 2012). Inefficiencies result in increased transaction costs and impede the overall competitiveness and economic performance of the country. The transport sector and other services sectors in general are mainly governed by domestic legislation. Barriers to trade in services may be located in laws and regulations of individual economies often referred to as behind the border measures such as license, technical, educational, registration and local ownership requirements and as such are more difficult to address than barriers to goods. (Hartzenberg, 2012). To identify these measures it is important to undertake an assessment of the legislation governing sector. This study analyses both vertical and horizontal legislation governing the sector. This study aims to assess the level of liberalisation of South Africa's transport sector to gauge the presence of trade restrictive measures in the sector that would limit access, establishment and or operation by foreign service suppliers. This is done through an analysis of domestic legislation governing the transport sector and its related sub - sectors. This effectively entails a comparison between actual commitments as reflected in South Africa's GATS <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> <b>specific</b> <b>commitments</b> and applied policy as reflected in legislation. Data from such a study provides valuable technical information to trade negotiators regarding the policy space available allowing them to develop and formulate informed negotiating positions. The methodology employed in this study is adapted from the World Bank's Regulatory Assessment of Services, Trade and Investment (RASTI) and has been adapted for purposes of this study. A country, prior to engaging in a services negotiation should conduct an assessment of the level of liberalisation of each service sector to gauge its competitive strengths and weaknesses. Such an assessment entails an assessment of the country's regulation to determine if such regulation is overly burdensome {{to the extent that it}} inhibits competition and trade in services in an economy. Once such an assessment is concluded, a large number of countries have found that domestic regulatory reforms are necessary for effective participation in services negotiations. (Molinuevo & Sáez, 2014). The importance for such assessments often referred to as audits, have been confirmed as the most effective way of ensuring that regulations are not restrictive of trade. (Molinuevo & Sáez, 2014). Moreover, periodic regulatory audits serve the purpose of identifying discriminatory measures and minimising discriminatory effects that have the effect of increasing costs and discriminating against foreign service suppliers. A comparison of the liberalisation of South Africa's transport sector in terms of the actual commitments (as reflected in the GATS services schedule) against the applied domestic regulation is an important exercise in view of the discussions at the WTO level about the liberalisation of services and at a regional level in view of South Africa's regional and continental aspirations to promote regional integration. The transport sector has been identified as a priority sector in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Tripartite Free Trade Area (TFTA) invol ving, COMESA, E AC and SADC. In the TFTA negotiations, even though the first phase focused on trade in goods, the second phase will address trade in services, including transport services. Negotiations in SADC based on the Protocol on Trade in Services are ongoing and wil l include transport services. A study of this nature is important for undertaking and formulating negotiating positions for trade in services and may be replicated across various service sectors...|$|E

40|$|The GATS {{does not}} offer a {{definition}} of "services", but services need to be identified and classified for {{the operation of the}} Agreement, especially for the <b>scheduling</b> <b>of</b> <b>specific</b> <b>commitments</b> on market access and national treatment. There is no obligation on WTO Members to use any particular classification system in undertaking commitments. Nevertheless, an informal document produced for the services negotiation during the Uruguay Round, the Services Sectoral Classification List (W/ 120), was used and continues to be used as the principal guiding classification system, not only in the WTO, but also in bilateral and plurilateral services trade negotiations outside of the WTO. WTO jurisprudence has also noted the role of W/ 120 in the determination of sectoral coverage of GATS commitments. However, services classification does not receive enough attention it deserves. This paper attempts to make contribution by providing an overview of services classification and highlighting its relevance to both trade negotiations and WTO dispute settlement. It consists of four sections. Section I reviews how a services classification system was introduced into the multilateral trading system and describes the main features of W 120. Section II takes a closer look at some aspects of the classification system, drawing attention to challenges in its application, which arise from inter alia services with multiple end-uses, overlaps between sectors, and the issue of "new services". Section III considers the implications of classification on GATS commitments by examining a number of WTO dispute settlement cases. Section IV concludes. In conclusion, the paper underlines the importance of services classification in assisting governments in clearly and accurately undertaking commitments. It also notes that WTO Members have taken or suggested various pragmatic approaches to addressing challenges in the application of the current services classification system. The proposed approaches again highlight the role of classification in ensuring the clarity, certainty and predictability <b>of</b> <b>specific</b> <b>commitments</b> in services...|$|R

40|$|SummaryWhile hematopoietic {{stem cell}} (HSC) {{self-renewal}} is well studied, it remains unknown whether distinct control mechanisms enable HSC divisions that generate progeny cells with specific lineage bias. Here, we report that the monocytic transcription factor MafB specifically restricts the ability of M-CSF to instruct myeloid commitment divisions in HSCs. MafB deficiency specifically enhanced sensitivity to M-CSF and caused activation of the myeloid master-regulator PU. 1 in HSCs in vivo. Single-cell analysis revealed that reduced MafB levels enabled M-CSF to instruct divisions producing asymmetric daughter pairs with one PU. 1 + cell. As a consequence, MafB−/− HSCs showed a PU. 1 and M-CSF receptor-dependent competitive repopulation advantage specifically in the myelomonocytic, but not T lymphoid or erythroid, compartment. Lineage-biased repopulation advantage was progressive, maintained long term, and serially transplantable. Together, this indicates that an integrated transcription factor/cytokine circuit can control the rate <b>of</b> <b>specific</b> HSC <b>commitment</b> divisions without compromising other lineages or self-renewal...|$|R
40|$|A major {{result of}} the Uruguay Round was the {{creation}} of a General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). The GATS greatly extends coverage of the multilateral trading system, establishing rules and disciplines on policies affecting access to service markets. In this paper, the author asks: what does the GATS do to bind policies? And has it established a mechanism likely to induce significant liberalization through future rounds of negotiations? The GATS consists of two elements: 1) a set of general concepts, principles, and rules that apply across the board to measures affecting trade in services; and 2) <b>specific</b> <b>commitments</b> on national treatment and market access. These apply only to service activities listed in a member's schedule - reflecting the agreement's"positive-list"approach to determining coverage - and {{only to the extent that}} sector-specific or cross-sectoral qualifications or conditions are not maintained. The impact of the GATS depends largely on the <b>specific</b> <b>commitments</b> made by members, and sectoral coverage is far from universal. High-income countries <b>scheduled</b> about half <b>of</b> their service sectors; developing countries as a group (including Eastern European countries in transition) scheduled only 11 percent. And the sectors scheduled often continue to be subject to measures that violate national treatment or limit market access. High-income countries scheduled only 28 percent of the universe of services without exceptions to national treatment or market access obligations. For developing countries, that figure is only 6. 5 percent. Much remains to be done. The GAT's weaknesses include: 1) a lack of transparency. No information is generated on sectors, subsectors, and activities in which no commitments are scheduled - most often the sensitive areas where restrictions and discriminatory practices abound; 2) the sector-specificity of liberalization commitments. Negotiations were driven by the concerns of major players of each industry, leading to an emphasis on"absolute"sectoral reciprocity, limiting the scope for incremental liberalization, tradeoffs across issues, and an economywide perspective; and 3) the limited number of generic rules. Rather than lock in liberal situations that exist, the GATS allows for the future imposition of restrictions (creating"negotiating chips"). To foster nondiscriminatory liberalization, sectoral agreeements should be firmly imbedded in a framework of general rules and disciplines. Many of the framework's general principles apply only if <b>specific</b> <b>commitments</b> have been made. Therefore they are not general. Proposals for improving the GATS should probably build on the existing structure as mush as possible. Possibilities include the following: 1) ultimately, apply the same rules to goods and services. Eliminate the artificial distinction between the two; 2) adopt a negative-list approach to scheduling commitments for the sake of transparency; 3) eliminate overlap between national treatment and market access; 4) develop generic,"horizontal"disciplines for the different modes of supply through which service markets may be contested; 5) explore the possibility of converting quota-like market access restrictions to price-based equivalent measures, thus ensuring that the most-favored-nation and national treatment principles are satisfied; 6) make framework disciplines general by eliminating all instances in which rules are conditional on the <b>scheduling</b> <b>of</b> <b>specific</b> commitments; and 7) agree to a formula-based approach for liberalizing and expanding the GAT's sectoral coverage in future negotiations.

Evans and Plows (2007) attempt to determine the specific knowledge that laypeople can contribute to technology appraisal is much in line with Alfred Schütz’ (1946) concept of the “well informed citizen” as holding a non-specific and therefore ubiquitous perspective on problems of everyday life, that discerns the informed citizen from the specialized but restricted expert’s perspective. For Evans and Plows, a true layperson is characterized by not disposing <b>of</b> <b>specific</b> knowledge but only of “ubiquitous” or “popular” knowledge. Their disinterestedness or impartiality (their “being not involved”) is regarded by Evans and Plows as the central feature that enables laypeople to develop an “external meta perspective” when dealing with contested issues of science and technology. When properly informed, they are able to appraise expert knowledge with regard to its practical (everyday life) implications. The appraisal is based either on general social beliefs (“ubiquitous discrimination”) or on particular knowledge and beliefs that they hold {{as a member of a}} particular community (“local discrimination”) (Evans and Plows, 831). The lack <b>of</b> a <b>specific</b> <b>commitment</b> enables laypeople to act as an independent jury, hearing evidence from different experts, and knowledge cultures. “Only those who are situated outside the committed knowledge cultures of both the scientific and activist communities can bring in a genuine civic epistemology” (Evans and Plows 2007, 843). I admit that more research is needed in order to understand the genuine perspective of laypeople, but it is evident that this perspective can necessarily only evolve in an (as much as possible) independent appraisal of expert and stakeholder knowledge. 3 [...]...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has clearly shown that peer-groups fulfil {{a variety of}} psychosocial functions for their members, and {{that the importance of}} these functions is differently underlined by different group typologies (Graziani, Rubini, & Palmonari, 2006). The present study aimed at analysing the relationship between the group membership functions and the behavioural outcomes of group belongingness in different types of adolescent peer-groups. In particular, we hypothesised that the group membership functions have a direct impact on the commitment behaviours toward the ingroup, and that this relation would be mediated by ingroup identification. 556 adolescents, members of sports, religious, political and informal groups, participated in the study by filling in a questionnaire, in which they were asked to rate the importance of eight group membership functions (self-esteem, self-insight and social understanding, ingroup cooperation, intergroup competition, intragroup social comparison, romantic involvement, amusement, and leadership), the degree of ingroup identification and the frequency <b>of</b> ingroup <b>specific</b> <b>commitment</b> behaviours, that is behaviours facilitating the ingroup life. The results showed that the commitment behaviours were influenced by different group membership functions, particularly by “ingroup cooperation” and “self-insight and social understanding”. Moreover, the pattern of the functions explaining the commitment behaviours varied in the different peer-groups considered. Finally, as hypothesised, in all group typologies the relationship between the group membership functions and the commitment behaviours was mediated by ingroup identification. These findings represent an interesting contribution {{in order to understand the}} links between adolescents and their groups and the behavioural consequences of identification with one’s own peer-group...|$|R
