25|$|While the European Union is not {{obliged to}} accept the Manx desire to {{introduce}} a special Manx version of the euro, Manx could arguably have introduced a currency pegged to the euro (akin to its <b>situation</b> <b>now</b> vis-à-vis the pound sterling, or {{the relationship between the}} euro and the Bulgarian lev). There is no precedent for divergent national versions, beyond customising the national side of euro coins {{in the same way as}} other eurozone members.|$|E

Four more died en route. Finally arriving in New Orleans late in 1848, the Texas pioneers were met by several hundred colonization enthusiasts from France, who had been slowly congregating in that city. Their mood was grim.|$|E
25|$|The <b>situation</b> <b>now</b> became {{extremely}} {{critical for}} Henry. As {{a result of}} the agitation, which was zealously fostered by the papal legate Bishop Altmann of Passau, the princes met in October at Trebur to elect a new German ruler. Henry, who was stationed at Oppenheim on the left bank of the Rhine, was only saved from the loss of his throne by the failure of the assembled princes to agree on the question of his successor.|$|E
25|$|On 16 January 1794 Jacques François Dugommier {{replaced}} Eustache Charles d'Aoust as commander-in-chief of the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees. Aoust {{was condemned}} and executed by guillotine on 2 July 1794. Dugommier had {{an advantage over}} previous commanders of the army because he came as the victor of the Siege of Toulon which ended on 19 December 1793. He was {{also a member of}} the National Convention and therefore part of the political establishment. Until Dugommier's accession, the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees was under the control of arrogant representatives on mission who abused their authority to remarkable degree.

25|$|Neilson also {{pushed the}} {{envelope}} causing several rules to be rewritten. During one Petes game, {{his team was}} up one goal, but was down two men in a five on three situation for the last minute of the game. Realizing that more penalties could not be called under the existing rules, Neilson put too many men on the ice every ten seconds. The referees stopped the play and a faceoff was held relieving pressure on the defence. After this display the rule was changed so that a call for too many men on the ice in a 5 on 3 <b>situation</b> <b>now</b> leads to a penalty shot.|$|E
25|$|The <b>situation</b> <b>now</b> {{escalated}} {{into an open}} breach as Sverre {{began building}} {{up a list of}} privileges that were contrary to the church law made by St. Olaf, the traditional founder of the Norwegian Church. Eirik on his side preached against the king and his men, and sent letters of complaint to the Pope, but in the short term his offensive weapons were few. In 1190 Sverre attempted to force the archbishop into submission, claiming that Eirik had broken the law by having 90 armed men in his service. According to law, the archbishop's guard was limited to 30 men. Rather than submit to the king's will, Eirik fled to Lund where the Danish archbishop had his seat. From there he sent a delegation to Rome asking the pope for advice.|$|E
25|$|On 10 July a {{new plan}} had to be made, after {{a copy of the}} {{offensive}} plan fell into Soviet hands. The 2nd Mountain Division had to expand the bridgehead, while the 3rd Mountain Division had to advance on the south and establish another bridgehead. The renewed attack was again initially successful, but after the Soviets landed with two battalions {{on the other side of}} the Litsa Bay further north, Dietl had to stop the offensive. The <b>situation</b> <b>now</b> became worse for the Germans, as the thinly stretched forces had to hold a 57km long frontline along the Litsa River to the Rybachy Peninsula. With the absence of roads, the supply situation also deteriorated and the offensive stalled. Dietl asked for more reinforcements and Hitler, after initially being reluctant, agreed to transfer the 6th Mountain Division from Greece to Dietl's command. After more arguing, in August the 388th and 9th SS Regiments were also assigned to the operation.|$|E

25|$|The fall of Tunis on 13 May 1943 radically {{changed the}} {{strategic}} <b>situation.</b> <b>Now</b> Italy {{was exposed to}} an invasion, and it became imperative for Germany to control the country, which had turned into an external bastion of the Reich. To take control of Italy and forcibly disarm the Italian armed forces after their expected armistice with the Allied forces, the Germans developed plans for operations Alarich and Konstantin, devoted respectively to the occupation of Italy herself and the Balkan areas occupied by the Italian Army. In preparation, the Germans wanted to move more land forces to Italy, but Ambrosio and Mussolini, who both wanted to preserve Italian independence, refused, asking only for more airplanes. On 11 June 1943, the Allies captured the island of Pantelleria, {{the first part of}} Italy to be lost. The small island had been turned by Mussolini into a citadel, but – unlike Malta – after a week-long heavy bombardment, it was reduced to a smoking crater, and fell to the Allies almost without resistance. It now became apparent that the next Allied move would be the invasion of one of the three large islands, Sicily, Sardinia or Corsica.|$|E
500|$|In 1897, Gould was enticed out of {{retirement}} for one last Championship. By now Gould was a household name throughout Britain, as much due to his personality and good looks as his brilliant centre play; a testimonial fund had been started with contributions being made by the public. This caused a stir among the other Home Unions, who viewed this {{as an effort to}} pay Gould for playing, which would constitute professionalism. As the arguments continued, Gould played his final international game, a solid 11–0 win over England in early January. Wales played no further matches that season after the events behind Gould's testimonial fund caused Wales to leave the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB), in a <b>situation</b> <b>now</b> referred to as the [...] "Gould affair".|$|E
500|$|Augustus {{was granted}} sole imperium {{within the city}} of Rome itself, in {{addition}} to being granted proconsular imperium maius and tribunician authority for life. Traditionally, proconsuls (Roman province governors) lost their proconsular [...] "imperium" [...] when they crossed the Pomerium – the sacred boundary of Rome – and entered the city. In these situations, Augustus would have power as part of his tribunician authority but his constitutional imperium within the Pomerium would be less than that of a serving consul. That would mean that, {{when he was in the}} city, he might not be the constitutional magistrate with the most authority. Thanks to his prestige or auctoritas, his wishes would usually be obeyed, but there might be some difficulty. To fill this power vacuum, the Senate voted that Augustus's imperium proconsulare maius (superior proconsular power) should not lapse when he was inside the city walls. All armed forces in the city had formerly been under the control of the urban praetors and consuls, but this <b>situation</b> <b>now</b> placed them under the sole authority of Augustus.|$|E

500|$|In October, Sallal's {{palace in}} San'a was {{attacked}} with a bazooka, and insurgents began targeting an Egyptian army camp {{outside the city}} and setting fire to Egyptian installations, killing a reported 70 Egyptian troops. Sallal arrested about 140 suspects, including Mohamed Ruwainy, the ex-Minister for Tribal Affairs, and Colonel Hadi Issa, former {{deputy chief of staff}} of the armed forces. Sallal accused Ruwainy and Issa of organizing a [...] "subversive network seeking to plunge the country into terrorism and panic" [...] and planning a campaign of assassination, financed by Saudi Arabia, Britain, Israel and the US. Ruwainy, Issa and five others were executed, while eight others received prison sentences ranging from five years to life. In February, 1967, Nasser vowed to [...] "stay in Yemen 20 years if necessary", while Prince Hussein bin Ahmed said [...] "We are [...] prepared to fight for 50 years to keep Nasser out, just as we did the Ottoman Turks."

500|$|Björk {{has stated}} that she wanted the album to sound like [...] "modern chamber music", {{referring}} to the times where [...] "the most ideal music situation was in the home, where people would play harps for each other". She argued that with the popularity of festivals like Woodstock, the situation became [...] "the opposite", and that {{with the advent of}} Napster, the Internet, music downloading and DVD, [...] "we've come full circle and the most ideal musical <b>situation</b> <b>now,</b> [...] is back to the home". She also considers Vespertine to be the opposite of her previous studio album Homogenic, the former being an introverted, quiet, winter record; the latter a loud, dramatic, summer record. Writer and critic Mark Pytlik writes, [...] "Her appetite for thumping techno had been, temporarily at least, subsumed by a desire for stark melodies and minimalist production". Although generally considered an electronica album — a loosely defined umbrella term —, as with other Björk releases, it has been difficult for critics to classify Vespertine within a musical genre. The album — and Björk's body of work in general — is considered art pop. The Orlando Weekly wrote that with the album, Björk [...] " [...] her modernist art-pop further into the abstract". Music journalists have noted the experimental nature of the record. According to Joseph Hale of Tiny Mix Tapes, Vespertines music [...] "finally made good on its dubious [...] "trip-hop" [...] label," [...] and described it as a combination of [...] "psychedelic techno, chamber music, and chorale together into modal constructions that swelled and receded like emotions (or psylocibin)". The music was also considered psychedelia by The Dallas Morning News and American critic Jim DeRogatis. David Fricke of Rolling Stone wrote [...] "Vespertine is the closest any pop-vocal album has come to the luxuriant Zen of the new minimalist techno". Björk has also described the album as [...] "more electronic folk music," [...] and Jason Killingsworth of Paste referred to the album as a [...] "folktronica gem". Vespertines music has also been categorised as ambient, glitch pop, and art rock.|$|E
