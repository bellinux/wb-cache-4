50|$|Topps has {{released}} five comic {{books in the}} Wacky Packages line. The panels of just the first two issues consist of reproductions of Halloween Postcard <b>sketch</b> <b>card</b> artwork, by Jay Lynch for issue 1 and by Joe Simko for issue 2, that were specifically designed to depict a story when set out as sequential art. Issue 3 was created by Neil Camera and Issue 4 by Brent Engstrom. Issue 5 was released on April 1, 2013, Topps' self-proclaimed Wacky Packages Day, and was a double-sized issue drawn by multiple artists.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>sketch</b> <b>card</b> insert {{has been}} most common in non-sport trading card sets like Lord of the Rings: Evolution, Star Wars: Clone Wars and Scooby-Doo: Mysteries & Monsters. A few sport sets have also adopted the idea like the 2005 Topps Gallery Baseball. One of the all-time most popular sets was the 1998 Marvel Creators Collection by Fleer. They called their sketch cards [...] "sketchagraph" [...] cards. The set was popular because it used the artistic skills of {{hundreds}} of different artists who were allowed to draw any character in the Marvel Comics universe.|$|E
50|$|After the {{successful}} re-launch of the Marvel Masterpieces set in 2007, Upper Deck decided to release another set. The second set, Marvel Masterpieces 2 {{came out in}} July 2008. This set consisted of a 90-card base set, 9 Marvel Heroines Chase Set, 9 Avengers Chase Set, 5 Fantastic Four Movie Memorabilia Chase Set, and 3 Hulk Chase Cards and 3 Iron Man Chase Cards. Also available one per box was a hand-drawn <b>sketch</b> <b>card</b> drawn by an artist. There were more sketch cards with this set than the 2007 set because this saw a release of 18,000 boxes as opposed to 13,000 in 2007. Upper Deck plans on releasing Marvel Masterpieces 3 on December 9, 2008.|$|E
5000|$|Additionally, {{there are}} {{randomly}} inserted [...] "Artist Sketch Cards" [...] each featuring an original sketch by a noted artist. These are all one-of-a-kind. It {{is not known}} exactly how many <b>sketch</b> <b>cards</b> were put into circulation, but there should be roughly the same number as the boxes, 13,000, since the odds on finding one is approximately 1:36 packs, or 1 per box. More information about the <b>sketch</b> <b>cards</b> {{can be found at}} http://www.scoundrelpublishing.com/spart2/viewforum.php?f=56&sid=90daa699d6a0ab63a72c109b836afd08Also, the art from the Alex Ross splash subset was made into ashcan box-toppers (black-and-white versions) and inserted randomly 1 per box, not in a pack. Plus, the artwork from the Art Adams splash subset was made into ashcan case-toppers, one included per factory case.|$|R

50|$|In February 2010, Topps {{released}} a series called Wacky Packages Old School. The Old School series line, created by David Gross, {{is designed to}} resemble the box, wrappers and stickers of the original successful run from 1973-1977. Each series consists of 33 stickers along with a 9 piece puzzle checklist with the gags based on products from the 1970s that Topps did not parody in the original 1970s run. Also included are various chase cards and a <b>sketch</b> <b>card</b> in every box. The first series sketch cards were all done by Jay Lynch. Old School series 2 began shipping in late March 2011 with sketch cards by Lynch, Bill Griffith, Bhob Stewart, David Gross, Fred Wheaton, Brent Engstrom, Jeff Zapata, Joe Simko, Neil Camera, Sam Gambino, Smokin' Joe and Mark Parisi. Old School series 3 shipped in mid-February 2012 and Old School series 4 in late December 2012. Old School series 5 came out in late 2014. There are 165 total Old School stickers at this point. Wacky Packages Old School is sold exclusively through the Topps Online Store.|$|E
40|$|Assessment! was a {{landmark}} {{in describing the}} developing concept of design and technological activity. The interaction between thought and action, mind and hand, summarised by the now familiar zigzag (see Fig. l) charted the progress of ideas from hazy impression to refined and detailed design proposals mirrored by successively more detailed models culminating in a completed (though not perfect) product. This description has as a central feature the act of modelling. It is {{all too easy to}} see the end result of the modelling activity, 'the models', as the most significant part of the activity. They are only significant to the extent that a) they help the pupil designer develop a clearer picture of that which he/she is designing and b) that they reveal to the teacher the mental processes of the pupil in coming to grips with the design task. While it may be convenient to classify the models in terms of their form (informal <b>sketch,</b> <b>card</b> mock up, 3 D rendering etc) it is important that teachers and pupils see them for what they are in educational terms- insights into pupil thinking. The use of science in D&T activity Technology and school science an HMI enquir / was severely critical of much of the technology education seen in the context of school science courses ' [...] . the science courses gave insufficient attention to the application of scientific knowledge in solving technological problems. ' The terms of reference given to the Working Party for Technology in the National Curriculum 3 were quite explicit on the special relationship between Technology and science (and also mathematics). Some attempts were made in the Final Report 4 to develop and describe this but these were heavily criticised as little more than references to science attainment targets. This criticism was seen as serious 'because attainment targets at higher levels should involve th...|$|E
