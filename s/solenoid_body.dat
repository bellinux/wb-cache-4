50|$|The rotary solenoid has {{a similar}} {{appearance}} to a linear solenoid, except that the core is mounted {{in the center of}} a large flat disk, with two or three inclined grooves cut into the underside of the disk. These grooves align with slots on the <b>solenoid</b> <b>body,</b> with ball bearings in the grooves.|$|E
50|$|The 41TE {{transmission}} which directly {{replaced the}} Ultradrive {{had a similar}} design and could be considered an evolutionary change, but it included different valve <b>bodies,</b> <b>solenoid</b> packs, sensors, and other components to increase reliability. This line was also given a flash-programmable TCM and, in 2006, a variable line pressure hydraulic system was phased in, which boosted performance and longevity.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{development}} of a sensor for measuring the location of the centre of mass and the mass of a machined part. The sensor consists of six components: power supply, <b>solenoid,</b> sensor <b>body,</b> signal measurement and conditioning system, interface system and personal computer (PC). The measurement results show that the sensor can determine the location of the centre of mass and the mass of a machined part. Defective parts can be identified by comparing the measured values with those of a standard part. Simply identifying defective parts is often not sufficient for an inspection system. A fuzzy defect identification system is developed and added to the sensor. It can use the deviations in the measured location of the centre of mass and the mass of a defective part to suggest possible defects that caused such deviations.

40|$|Parts {{inspection}} {{is usually}} required {{to ensure that}} a part is machined according to its specifications. It often involves measuring various physical attributes of the part and comparing the measured values against those specified. Generally, a defective part will have a different mass as well as a different location of centre of mass compared with a good part, irrespective of the defect. This paper reports on the development of a sensor for measuring the location of the centre of mass and the mass of a machined part. The sensor consists of six components: power supply, <b>solenoid,</b> sensor <b>body,</b> signal measurement and conditioning system, interface system, and a personal computer. The measurement results show that the sensor can determine the location of the centre of mass and the mass of a machined part. By comparing the measured values with those of a standard part, defective parts can be identified. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
