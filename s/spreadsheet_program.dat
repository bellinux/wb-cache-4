The measures are placed at the intersections of the hypercube, which is spanned by the dimensions as a vector space.

25|$|The Microsoft Excel <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>program</b> {{had a very}} {{elementary}} Y2K problem: Excel (in both Windows and Mac versions, {{when they}} are set to start at 1900) incorrectly set the year 1900 as a leap year for compatibility with Lotus 1-2-3. In addition, the years 2100, 2200, and so on, were regarded as leap years. This bug was fixed in later versions, but since the epoch of the Excel timestamp was set to the meaningless date of 0 January 1900 in previous versions, the year 1900 is still regarded as a leap year to maintain backward compatibility.|$|E

It can't add columns or rows {{except at the}} edge of the document, rearrange columns or rows, delete rows or columns, or add spreadsheet tabs. The 2007 version has the ability to use a full-screen mode to deal with limited screen resolution, as well as split panes to view different parts of a worksheet at one time. Protection settings, zoom settings, autofilter settings, certain chart formatting, hidden sheets, and other features are not supported on Excel Mobile, and will be modified upon opening and saving a workbook. In 2015, Excel Mobile became available for Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile on Windows Store.|$|E
25|$|WordStar, one of {{the first}} widely used word processors, and dBASE, an early and popular {{database}} program for small computers, were originally written for CP/M. Two early outliners, KAMAS (Knowledge and Mind Amplification System) and its cut-down successor Out-Think (without programming facilities and retooled for 8080/V20 compatibility) were also written for CP/M, though later rewritten for MS-DOS. Turbo Pascal, the ancestor of Borland Delphi, and Multiplan, the ancestor of Microsoft Excel, also debuted on CP/M before MS-DOS versions became available. Visicalc, the first-ever <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>program,</b> was made available for CP/M. Another company, Sorcim, created its Supercalc spreadsheet for CP/M, which would go on to become the market leader and de facto standard on CP/M. Supercalc would go on to be a competitor in the spreadsheet market in the MS-DOS world. AutoCAD, a CAD application from Autodesk debuted on CP/M. A host of compilers and interpreters for popular programming languages of the time (such as BASIC, Borland's Turbo Pascal and FORTRAN) were available, among them several of the earliest Microsoft products.|$|E

To provide a complete office suite, Claris purchased the rights to the Informix Wingz <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>program</b> on the Mac, renaming it Claris Resolve, and added the new presentation software Claris Impact. By the early 1990s, Claris applications were shipping with the majority of consumer-level Macintoshes and were extremely popular. In 1991, Claris released ClarisWorks, which soon became their second best-selling application. When Claris was reincorporated back into Apple in 1998, ClarisWorks was renamed AppleWorks beginning with version 5.0.|$|E

While early Apple II models used ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded {{by the introduction of}} a 5Â¼inch floppy disk drive and interface called the Disk II. The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first [...] "killer app" [...] of the business world: VisiCalc, a <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>program.</b> VisiCalc created a business market for the Apple II and gave home users an additional reason to buy an Apple II: compatibility with the office.

In 1961, Richard Mattessich, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, pioneered the concept of electronic spreadsheets for use in business accounting. In the autumn of 1978, Harvard Business School student, Dan Bricklin, {{came up with the idea}} for an interactive visible calculator.

One common {{class of errors}} concerns unit errors, because spreadsheets often employ formulas with physical or monetary units. In this paper, we describe XeLda, our tool for unit checking Excel spreadsheets. The tool highlights cells if their formulas process values with incorrect units and if derived units clash with unit annotations. In addition, it draws arrows to {{the sources of the}} formulas for debugging. The tool is sensitive to many of the intricacies of Excel spreadsheets including tables, matrices, and even circular references.

Important decisions are based on the results of <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>programs</b> and the list of known errors with large impact is growing daily- although it surely is only the top of an iceberg. One way out of the crisis might be the introduction of software engineering techniques into spreadsheet development. Suggestions for the improvement of spreadsheet development range back as far as into the late eighties, but none has been successful yet. We argue this is either because not enough effort is put into the roll-out of the technique to the users and, mainly, because they neglect the fact that spreadsheet programmers are end-users, not willing or not able to spend any time on learning software engineering methods. We found out that most end users are willing to verify their spreadsheets, but only view have the time and skills to do really systematic testing of spreadsheets. representations of <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>programs</b> that are then displayed to the user by different visualisation techniques to support the auditing process.
