It was a gallant sight to see that old warrior, Infadoos, as cool {{as though he were}} on parade, shouting out orders, taunts, and even jests, to keep up the spirit of his few remaining men, and then, as each charge rolled on, stepping forward to wherever the fighting was thickest, to bear his share in its repulse. And yet more gallant was the vision of Sir Henry, whose ostrich plumes had been shorn off by a spear thrust, so that his long yellow hair streamed out in the breeze behind him. There he stood, the great Dane, for he was nothing else, his hands, his axe, and his armour all red with blood, and none could live before his <b>stroke.</b> <b>Time</b> after time I saw it sweeping down, as some great warrior ventured to give him battle, and as he struck he shouted [...] "O-hoy!

5000|$|Upon the {{awarding}} of a penalty <b>stroke,</b> <b>time</b> in the match is stopped. [...] The penalty stroke is between any chosen attacking player and the defensive goalkeeper. The penalty stroke is taken from the penalty spot which is 6.4 m {{directly in front of}} the centre of the goal. Before the penalty stroke is taken, the goalkeeper must be standing with both feet on the goal line and the attacker within playing distance of the ball. When the umpire blows his whistle, the attacker may play the ball at goal using a [...] "push, flick or scoop" [...] motion. The attacking player must not feint and can only play the ball once (there is no rebound); the goalkeeper is not permitted to move his feet until the ball is played. A goal is scored if the ball completely crosses the line. Otherwise, play resumes with a defensive 15 m free-hit. Any infringement by an attacking player during the stroke concludes in the same result, an infringement by a defensive player may result in the penalty stroke being retaken if a goal has not been scored.|$|E

Sixteen, experienced female outrigger canoeists completed three 1000 m outrigger ergometer time trials, one trial each using a self-selected, a Hawaiian (65 strokes·min- 1) stroke rate. Stroke rate, stroke length, <b>stroke</b> <b>time,</b> proportion {{of time spent in}} propulsion and recovery, torso flexion angle and 'twist' were measured and compared with repeated measures ANOVAs. Stroke rate, stroke length and <b>stroke</b> <b>time</b> were significantly different across all interventions (p < 0. 05) despite no difference in the percentage of time spent in the propulsive and recovery phases of the stroke. Stroke length and <b>stroke</b> <b>time</b> were negatively correlated to stroke rate for all interventions (r = - 0. 79 and - 0. 99, respectively). Female outrigger canoeists maintain consistent stroke kinematics throughout a 1000 m time trial, most likely as a learned skill to maximize crew paddling synchrony when paddling on-water. While the Hawaiian stroke rate resulted in the greatest trunk flexion movement and 'twist' action, this potential increased back injury risk may be offset by the slow stroke rate and long stroke length and hence slow rate of force development...|$|E

One male triathlete, who competed in international elite triathlon races, was voluntarily participated in this study. A subject performed 5 times 3 -min swims in a swimming flume taking enough rests between sets. Flow velocities increased from 1. 10 m·s- 1 to 1. 30 m·s- 1 by 0. 05 m·s- 1 every sets.

The paper studies <b>stroke</b> break <b>times</b> within handwritten characters and presents a new method for setting HWR timeout by examining the break time distributions. For multi-stroke character HWR input, a timeout is widely used as a segmentation technique to initiate the recognition process. In this paper, we examine the largest <b>stroke</b> break <b>time</b> in each character and explore the relationship between break time distribution and optimal HWR timeout. The study used Chinese as test material and the test independent variables were writing condition (input box, full screen) and user’s posture while they were writing (hold device in hand, keep device on table). The main findings are: (1) the <b>stroke</b> break <b>times</b> are similar in full screen and input box conditions, though the users tend to write larger characters in full screen condition. (2) The <b>stroke</b> break <b>times</b> fit into a tight distribution. It is feasible to estimate optimal HWR timeout by studying stoke break time distribution. A nonparametric histogram method was used to model the stroke break distributions and it showed that typical Chinese HWR default timeouts are around 99 % percentile in the distribution. (3) Differences in HWR stroke break distributions are very significant between individual users. The <b>stroke</b> break <b>time</b> analysis can also be applied to design HWR timeout customization scale...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} what effect resistance would have on performance in double poling, with focus on power output, physiological responses and myoelectric activation. 6 elite male cross country skiers were exposed to simulated double poling in a Concept II Ski Ergometer at two different resistances, respectively low and high. The major findings were that power output significantly increased with the higher resistance, as well as work per cycle. These findings are previously shown in earlier research. Cycle rate remained unchanged, while <b>stroke</b> <b>time</b> increased. Earlier studies have confirmed that <b>stroke</b> <b>time</b> increase at added resistance or incline, to utilize a longer period of the cycle time to produce the required force to overcome the resistance or incline. Gross efficiency did not differ between the resistances, and no significant changes in electromyography activity were present. The increase in power output and work per cycle was therefore not attributed to an increased muscle activity. The main findings in this study are therefore inconclusive, and the increase in power output and work per cycle could be caused by other factors, such as muscle coordination and timing or changes in technical execution. </p...|$|E

40|$|In {{nuclear power}} plants, many valves are {{operated}} under harsh {{conditions such as}} high temperature-high pressure and radiation environments but high levels of reliability are required from valves for safety operation of the power plant. However, deterioration of valve parts due to power plant aging and the system's transient phenomena due to rapid load shift operation are acting as obstacles that impede securing valve reliability. To secure valve reliability, quality in design/production stages and intended performance under the worst operation conditions shall be assured. Also, {{it is necessary to}} meet the reliability level given in the specified environment conditions and to perform the designed functions throughout its lifetime without failure. Meanwhile, to enhance the safety and the operation of nuclear power plants, it is important to early detect the deterioration of valve performance and take measures quickly. However the mechanical defects of valves are occurs suddenly in various types and {{it is very difficult to}} predict them. Valves which are responsible for the important functions of nuclear power plants are confirmed performance and durability before the installation. However, the performance degradation and defects of the valve are occurs during plant operating. Therefore, to ensure that the valves perform their designed functions for the requested period without failure, it is important to demonstrate their reliability in all stages such as design, production, and operation. The purpose of this paper is the best preventive maintenance and life cycle management, including comprehensive quality control measures established in the valves. Therefore, the performance verification through performance validation tests were performed on air operated valves most commonly used in nuclear power plants. In addition, the leakage and <b>stroke</b> <b>time</b> were measured by performing an accelerated life test (thermal aging, radiation exposure, mechanical cycling) under the operating conditions of the power plants. Results show that the thermal aging of valves has significant effects on the valve seat and stem leakage but it has almost no effect on the actuator leakage and the <b>stroke</b> <b>time.</b> Meanwhile, it is found that the radiation and mechanical aging of valves have no clear effect on the leakage and <b>stroke</b> <b>time</b> of valves...|$|E

However, {{the relationship between the}} acute-phase CRP level and discharge outcome has received little attention. We prospectively studied 301 patients with acute ischemic stroke (over a period of two weeks) from two hospital stroke wards and one rehabilitation department in Henan, China. Patients’ demographic and clinical data were collected and evaluated at admission. Poor discharge outcome was assessed in patients at discharge using the Modified Rankin Scale (MRS > 2). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the risk factors of poor discharge outcome after adjusting for potential confounders. Poor discharge outcome was observed in 78 patients (25. 9 %). Univariate analyses showed that factors significantly influencing poor discharge outcome were age, residence, recurrent acute ischemic stroke, coronary heart disease, the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at admission, non-lacunar <b>stroke,</b> <b>time</b> from onset of stroke to admission, CRP, TBIL (total bilirubin), direct bilirubin (DBIL), ALB (albumin), FIB (fibrinogen) and D-dimer (p < 0. 05). After adjusting for age, residence, recurrent ischemic stroke, coronary heart disease, NIHSS score at admission, lacunar <b>stroke,</b> <b>time</b> from onset of stroke to admission, CRP, TBIL, DBIL, ALB, FIB and D-dimer, multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that poor outcome at discharge was associated with recurrent acute ischemic stroke (OR, 2. 115; 95 % CI, 1. 094 – 4. 087), non-lacunar stroke (OR, 2. 943; 95 % CI, 1. 436 – 6. 032), DBIL (OR, 1. 795; 95 % CI, 1. 311 – 2. 458), and CRP (OR, 4. 890; 95 % CI, 3. 063 – 7. 808).
