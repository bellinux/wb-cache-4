2500|$|Milgram trained speech shadowers to {{replicate}} in real-time spontaneous prose supplied by a remote [...] "source" [...] by-way-of discreet radio transmission during face-to-face dialogue with naïve [...] "interactants". In homage to Cyrano, {{he referred to}} the hybrid agent formed by combining the words of one individual with the body of another as a [...] "cyranoid". In his studies, interactants repeatedly failed to detect that their interlocutors were merely speech shadowing for third parties, implicitly and explicitly attributing to them communicative autonomy. Milgram referred to this phenomenon as the [...] "cyranic illusion". This illusion held even in circumstances involving high disparity between <b>shadower</b> and source, such as when he sourced for child shadowers while being interviewed by panels of teachers (naïve to the deception) tasked with assessing each child's intellectual abilities.|$|E

40|$|Speech {{alignment}} {{occurs when}} interlocutors shift their speech {{to become more}} similar to each other. Alignment {{can also be found}} when one is asked to shadow (quickly say out-loud) perceived words recorded from a model. Prior investigations on alignment have addressed whether <b>shadowers</b> of auditory (e. g. Goldinger, 1998) or visual (e. g. Miller, Sanchez, & Rosenblum, 2010) speech would shift {{in the direction of a}} model. However, it is unknown whether multiple <b>shadowers</b> align to a specific model in the same ways or uniquely. This Dissertation addressed two questions: Are utterances of <b>shadowers</b> of the same model more similar to each other than they are to the utterances of <b>shadowers</b> of a different model? Does the sensory modality of the shadowed speech affect the perceptual similarity between the <b>shadowers</b> of the same model? In Experiment Series 1, evidence that <b>shadowers</b> similarly aligned to the auditory speech of a model was obtained. In Experiment 1 a perceptual raters judged the utterances of <b>shadowers</b> of the same heard model as being more similar than utterances from <b>shadowers</b> of another heard model. In Experiment 1 b it was found that the results from Experiment 1 a were due to speech style shifts towards those of the shadowed model and that the <b>shadowers</b> were not similar before exposure to the model. Acoustical analyses of the shadowed words also revealed that <b>shadowers</b> of the same model were more similar along some acoustic dimensions to each other than words from <b>shadowers</b> of a different model. The articulatory dimensions behind these similar acoustic dimensions could also potentially be perceived in visible articulation, suggesting that the results from Experiment 1 a might also be found for <b>shadowers</b> of visual speech (lip-reading). In Experiment Series 2, evidence that <b>shadowers</b> similarly aligned to the visual speech of a specific model was obtained. In Experiment 2 a perceptual raters judged the utterances of <b>shadowers</b> of the same lip-read model as being more similar than the shadowed utterances of the other lip-read model. Experiment 2 b compared auditory and visually shadowed speech of <b>shadowers</b> of the same or a different model. Utterances of multiple <b>shadowers</b> of the same model were judged as being more similar than those of <b>shadowers</b> of another model, regardless of whether the model's speech was shadowed auditorily or visually. These results suggest that <b>shadowers</b> align to similar properties of a specific model's speech even when doing so based on different modalities. Implications for episodic encoding and gestural theories are discussed...|$|R

He entertained little hope of finding either food or water outside the wall, but he would try and then, if he failed, he would attempt {{to make his way}} into the city, for Tara of Helium must have sustenance and have it soon. He saw that the walls were poorly sentineled, but they were sufficiently high to render an attempt to scale them foredoomed to failure. Taking advantage of underbrush and trees, Turan managed to reach the base of the wall without detection. Silently he moved north past the gateway which was closed by a massive gate which effectively barred even the slightest glimpse within the city beyond. It was Turan's hope to find upon {{the north side of the}} city away from the hills a level plain where grew the crops of the inhabitants, and here too water from their irrigating system, but though he traveled far along that seemingly interminable wall he found no fields nor any water. He searched also for some means of ingress to the city, yet here, too, failure was his only reward, and now as he went keen eyes watched him from above and a silent stalker kept pace with him for a time upon the summit of the wall; but presently the <b>shadower</b> descended to the pavement within and hurrying swiftly raced ahead of the stranger without.|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a new and}} robust linear programming-based method for recovering surface information from the shadows that an object casts (on itself or elsewhere), even when the input imagery is errorful and noisy. We review the four basic constraints that arise in binary shadow imagery, and we demonstrate that noise leads to inconsistent constraints which cause infinite cycles of constraint propagation. We classify these noise errors into mutual <b>shadowers,</b> mutual failing <b>shadowers,</b> and single-point inconsistencies, and we show {{that they tend to}} grow in number as imagery increases; further, we show that finding a consistent subset of "good" pixels is an NP-complete problem. We therefore reformulate the problem (in one dimension) as a modified version of a linear programming task. We recast the constraints as linear inequalities, and a new class of variables [...] - shift variables [...] -is used to warp the imagery. By careful constructio [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|Aircraft {{also had}} an {{important}} indirect role, by preventing even the formation of wolf packs. They limited the places U-boats could attack in safety, and (by reducing the ability of <b>shadowers</b> to find and track convoys) made shipping harder to find, thereby reducing losses.

An innovative use of the [...] "propwash" [...] generated by propellers directed over the full-span flaps led to an impressive minimum speed of 39 mph (63 km/h) which would have allowed the Fleet <b>Shadower</b> to cruise effortlessly above an enemy fleet. [...] During testing the aircraft suffered from aerodynamic stability problems, but not as bad as the Airspeed design which was cancelled in February 1941. The aircraft had major modification before flying again in June 1941 with the Niagara V engines; the three tail fins having been replaced by a single large fin. With the incomplete second G.A.L.38 being used as a spares source, test flying continued until September 1941. In October 1941 the company was instructed to scrap the second aircraft, and in March 1942 instructions were issued to scrap the prototype as well.|$|E

The Royalists complement was 600 versus the 550 of the Bellona, and with extra equipment the larger crew had to be accommodated in less space.
