40|$|In biomass studies, this {{air-lift}} larva pump as {{one type}} of gear for quantitive larva sampling is an effectual method, which can be permited continuous sampling. On the practical method, some preliminary examinations were done by the fair prospect on the method of <b>side</b> <b>trawling</b> type and stern trawling type, during 1 ~ 3 knots (towing speed) ...|$|E
25|$|Krill {{are small}} animals, {{considered}} {{a type of}} zooplankton, and hence need to be fished with fine-meshed plankton nets. Such nets pose several problems: they tend to clog fast, and they have high drag, producing a bow wave that deflects the krill to the <b>sides.</b> <b>Trawling</b> must hence be done at low speeds. Additionally, fine nets are delicate, and the first krill nets designed exploded while fishing through the krill schools. Furthermore, fine nets increase unwanted bycatch, such as fish fingerlings, which might have unforeseen side-effects on the ecosystem, even though large krill aggregations tend to be monospecific.|$|R
60|$|Still more {{important}} {{was it to}} notice upon which <b>side</b> the <b>trawl</b> was to be lowered, after being emptied; and upon which tack the vessel was to proceed. For a mistake in this respect would be certain to bring the smack across another; {{in which case the}} trawl ropes would become entangled--involving, in a heavy sea, the certain loss of one or the other. Many of the smacks carry dogs, and it is found that these become even better watchers than their masters; for they can be relied on to call the attention of the watch, by sharp barking, to the letting up of the rocket, however distant.|$|R
25|$|Side {{trawlers}} – {{have the}} trawl set over the <b>side</b> with the <b>trawl</b> warps passing through blocks which hang from two gallows, one forward and one aft. Until the late sixties, side trawlers {{were the most}} familiar vessel in the North Atlantic deep sea fisheries. They evolved {{over a longer period}} than other trawler types, but are now being replaced by stern trawlers.|$|R
5000|$|... "When {{it comes}} to the Fourth Amendment, the home is first among equals," [...] Justice Scalia wrote. [...] "At the amendment's very core stands the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from {{unreasonable}} government intrusion." [...] Scalia added: [...] "This right would be of little practical value if the state's agents could stand in a home's porch or <b>side</b> garden and <b>trawl</b> for evidence with impunity." ...|$|R
50|$|This {{method is}} to use two <b>trawls</b> <b>side</b> by side. Three wires attach to this combination. Instead of having {{individual}} wires connected {{to each of the}} nets sides, a common wire attaches to the two inner sides and the outer sides of each net are wired individually. Again otter boards allow the net mouths to spread apart horizontally while floats and ground ropes provide the vertical forces. This gear is usually used for catching target fish such as monkfish, flatfish and nephrops.|$|R
25|$|The vessels were {{designed}} {{with a single}} deck with a long raised quarter deck carried to the fore <b>side</b> of the <b>trawl</b> winch and also a raised top-gallant forecastle. On the forecastle deck a windlass for working the winch was fitted, and an anchor of the stockless type housed in a long hawse pipe. An iron breakwater was also fitted to divert the sea when the vessels are being driven in heavy weather. The crew was housed under the forecastle deck, the entrance being through a lobby on the starboard side over which the forecastle deck was carried affording ample protection to the crew when entering or leaving the forecastle in heavy weather.|$|R
2500|$|Side {{trawlers}} {{have the}} trawl deployed over the <b>side</b> with the <b>trawl</b> warps passing through blocks suspended from a forward gallow and another aft gallow. Usually the superstructure is towards the stern, the fish hold amidships, and the transversal trawl winch {{forward of the}} superstructure. A derrick may be a boom rigged to the foremast to help shoot the codend from the side. Until the late sixties, side trawlers were the most common deep sea boat used in North Atlantic fisheries. The 1950s side trawler, Ross Tiger is preserved in Grimsby. These trawlers were used {{for a longer period}} than other kinds of trawlers, but are now being replaced by stern trawlers. Some side trawlers still in use have been equipped with net drums.|$|R
50|$|The Mincarlo was {{the type}} of trawler known as a sidewinder or side trawler. On sidewinders, the trawl nets are {{deployed}} over the <b>side</b> with the <b>trawl</b> warps passed through blocks suspended from two gallows. These gallows were forward and aft, on the starboard side of the Mincarlo. The fishing gear consisted of two otter trawls each of which was fitted with otter boards. Otter boards keep the mouth of the trawl net open and are positioned {{in such a way that}} the hydrodynamic forces, acting on them when the net is towed along the seabed, pushes the boards outwards. This keeps the mouth of the net open. The nets were attached to heavy duty ground ropes, 40 ft long, which held the nets on the seabed and ticked up any fish lying on or below the sand. Until the late sixties, sidewinders were the most common deep sea boat used in North Atlantic fisheries. They were used for a longer period than other types of trawler.|$|R
40|$|The drag of a prawn-trawl body is characterised by five {{design and}} three {{operational}} variables. The design variables comprise headline length, steepness of <b>trawl</b> <b>side</b> cut, width-to-depth mesh {{ratio of the}} trawl mouth (gape), vertical wing-end mesh count, and netting solidity; all of which effectively determine the planar twine-area of the trawl. The operational variables include towing velocity, horizontal spread, and vertical opening (headline height) —these determine {{the extent that the}} netting is exposed to relative water movement. The individual drag effects of the above variables (except for headline length, gape, and netting solidity) were systematically examined in a flume tank with prawn-trawl models built with low-stiffness full-scale netting; and the existing literature was consulted on the drag effects of gape, while drag was assumed to be proportional to twine diameter, mesh size 1 and headline length 2. The developed equations in non-dimensional forms provide the basis for a drag-prediction model for a prawn trawl of any size, construction and operating conditions. Comparisons with previously published prediction equations showed considerable disagreement in some aspects, and suggest that using stiff, fullscale netting in past model experiments have produced significant model-to-full-scale prediction errors owing to the poor equivalence of twine bending-stiffness-to-netting-tension ratio...|$|R
40|$|Marine {{protected}} areas (MPAs) {{are widely used}} to protect exploited fish species {{as well as to}} conserve marine habitats and their biodiversity. They have also become a popular management tool for bottom trawl fisheries, a common fishing technique on continental shelves worldwide. The effects of bottom trawling go far beyond the impact on target species, as trawls also affect other components of the benthic ecosystem and the seabed itself. This means that for bottom trawl fisheries, MPAs can potentially be used not only to conserve target species but also to reduce impact of these side effects of the fishery. However, predicting the protective effects of MPAs is complicated because the <b>side</b> effects of <b>trawling</b> potentially alter the food-web interactions between target and non-target species. These changes in predatory and competitive interactions among fish and benthic invertebrates may have important ramifications for MPAs as tools to manage or mitigate the effects of bottom trawling. Yet, in current theory regarding the functioning of MPAs in relation to bottom trawl fisheries, such predatory and competitive interactions between species are generally not taken into account. In this study, we discuss how food-web interactions that are potentially affected by bottom trawling may alter the effectiveness of MPAs to protect (1) biodiversity and marine habitats, (2) fish populations, (3) fisheries yield, and (4) trophic structure of the community. We make the case that in order to be applicable for bottom trawl fisheries, guidelines for the implementation of MPAs must consider their potential food-web effects, at the risk of failing management. </p...|$|R
