5|$|On {{their first}} stop ashore at St Jago in Cape Verde, Darwin {{found that a}} white band high in the {{volcanic}} rock cliffs included seashells.

5|$|The {{transition}} from 2D graphics to 3D environments overlaid on pre-rendered backgrounds {{was accompanied by}} a focus on a more realistic presentation. In previous entries, the sizes for characters and environments were fixed, and the player <b>saw</b> <b>things</b> from a scrolling perspective. This changed with Final Fantasy VII; environments shifted with camera angles, and character model sizes shifted depending on both their place in the environment and their distance from the camera, giving a sense of scale. The choice of this highly cinematic style of storytelling, contrasting directly with Square's previous games, was attributed to Kitase, who was a fan of films and had an interest in the parallels between film and video game narrative. Character movement during in-game events was done by the character designers in the planning group. While designers normally cooperate with a motion specialist for such animations, the designers taught themselves motion work, resulting in each character's movements differing depending on their creators—some designers liked exaggerated movements, while others went for subtlety. Much of the time was spent on each character's day-to-day, routine animations. Motion specialists were brought in for the game's battle animations. The first characters the team worked with were Cloud and Barret. Some of the real-time effects, such as an explosion near the opening, were hand-drawn rather than computer animated.|$|E

25|$|The 1982–83 season <b>saw</b> <b>things</b> {{get worse}} for the Centennials as they lost one more game and {{finished}} with four fewer points, ending up last in the entire BCJHL. The team also set a BCJHL record for fewest goals scored in a 56-game season with 166. The record still stands as the fourth fewest goals scored in any season in BCJHL history. It also {{marked the first time}} since the team relocated to Merritt that it missed the playoffs.|$|E
25|$|Although he {{attained}} {{his goal}} of becoming elected to the federal government, McGeer was once again relegated to the back benches of Mackenzie King's government. He had a warm relationship with King through much of his political career, but King did not embrace McGeer's monetary schemes but eventually <b>saw</b> <b>things</b> his way. Despite the reservations of the political elite, McGeer was immensely popular outside those circles because of his fiery oration skills. His tirades against bankers and the banking system proved especially popular during the Great Depression, and he regularly lectured to packed houses across the country.|$|E

Their first World Cup saw the South Africans seeded into the toughest group of the competition containing Australia, England and Fiji. The South Africans found their three group matches extremely difficult and failed to win a match during the tournament.|$|E
25|$|Nadezhda von Meck <b>saw</b> <b>things</b> very differently. To her, {{filling the}} roles of mother, nurse, governess, dressmaker, housekeeper, and valet was far easier to bear than the humiliation of seeing her husband as a cog in the machine of a {{government}} organization. Neither did fulfilling all those domestic duties lower her resolve or weaken her energy in urging {{him to make a}} break. Russia, desperately short of railways, was expanding its communications network rapidly, and Nadezhda was far-sighted enough to see that a future for her husband lay there. She continually exerted pressure on him to find a partner with capital and to join the boom in Russian railway construction.|$|E

500|$|The Hobbit employs {{themes of}} animism. An {{important}} concept in anthropology and child development, animism {{is the idea}} that all things—including inanimate objects and natural events, such as storms or purses, as well as living things like animals and plants—possess human-like intelligence. John D. Rateliff calls this the [...] "Doctor Dolittle Theme" [...] in The History of the Hobbit, and cites the multitude of talking animals as indicative of this theme. These talking creatures include ravens, a thrush, spiders and the dragon Smaug, alongside the anthropomorphic goblins and elves. Patrick Curry notes that animism is also found in Tolkien's other works, and mentions the [...] "roots of mountains" [...] and [...] "feet of trees" [...] in The Hobbit as a linguistic shifting in level from the inanimate to animate. Tolkien saw the idea of animism as closely linked to the emergence of human language and myth: [...] "...The first men to talk of 'trees and stars' <b>saw</b> <b>things</b> very differently. To them, the world was alive with mythological beings... To them the whole of creation was 'myth-woven and elf-patterned'." ...|$|E
500|$|As the German Army {{advanced}} through southern Belgium on 12 May, General Ewald von Kleist and Guderian clashed {{over where}} {{the main point}} of effort should fall. Kleist was Guderian's immediate superior, commanding Panzergruppe von Kleist, consisting of XLI Panzer Corps and XIX Panzer Corps (under Guderian). Kleist pressed for the main point to come at Flize, further west than Sedan. Kleist argued that the blow would avoid a double river crossing at the Meuse (at Sedan) and Ardennes canal (to the west of Sedan). Moreover, the blow would strike at the dividing line between the French Ninth Army and the French Second Army. Guderian <b>saw</b> <b>things</b> differently, and pointed out that a thrust {{along the lines of}} Kleist's plan would put the flank of the advance within range of the fortress artillery at Charleville-Mézières, some [...] north west of Sedan. The shift of operations further north would also disperse concentration (or Schwerpunkt) and disrupt the intense planning of the German tactical units, who had been in training for the Sedan attack and an advance north-west, for months. He also felt that a regrouping period in front of Sedan would delay the assault for 24 hours and allow the French to bring up reinforcements. Kleist agreed that such a delay was unacceptable, so he agreed to Guderian's plan.|$|E

2500|$|The new rail regulator, Tom Winsor (later Sir Thomas Winsor), {{had been}} Swift's general counsel (1993–95), and adopted a more interventionist and {{aggressive}} regulatory approach. At times {{the relationship was}} stormy, with Railtrack resisting pressure to improve its performance. In April 2000 it {{was reported in the}} Guardian that [...] "Railtrack is adopting a deliberate 'culture of defiance' against the rail regulator". Gerald Corbett, Railtrack's chief executive at the time, and Winsor clearly <b>saw</b> <b>things</b> very differently from each other. Railtrack resisted regulatory action to improve its performance, and as the regulator probed ever more deeply, serious shortcomings in the company's stewardship of the network were revealed.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{influence}} of Burne-Jones and the Pre-Raphaelites on the Birmingham Group is clear, modern scholarship has also seen links with later movements in art. The Last Romantics exhibition at the Barbican Art Gallery in 1989 positioned the group as the link connecting the romanticism of the Pre-Raphaelites {{to that of the}} later symbolists of the Slade School. Southall himself has been seen as a precursor of surrealism, with John Russell Taylor writing that [...] "there is undoubtedly an authentic strangeness in the way he <b>saw</b> <b>things</b> ... we {{are much more likely to}} find ourselves thinking of Magritte and Balthus and Chirico than of anyone nearer to this apparently stick-in-the-mud Arts-and-Craftsman." ...|$|E

2500|$|The multimillion-pound {{rebuilding}} of the Molineux Street Stand in 1979 {{was to be}} the catalyst for the club's near-financial ruin during the next decade as difficulties in repaying the loans taken out to fund it led to receivership and relegation in 1982. The club was [...] "saved" [...] from liquidation at the last minute when it was purchased by a consortium fronted by former player Derek Dougan. Initially this takeover, financed by two Saudi brothers, Mahmud and Mohammad Bhatti of the company Allied Properties, brought immediate promotion back to the First Division under manager Graham Hawkins, but the Bhattis' failure to sufficiently invest in the club soon <b>saw</b> <b>things</b> unravel as the team suffered three consecutive relegations under different managers through the football divisions, as well as the almost-constant threat of the club being wound-up.|$|E
2500|$|Petrosyan {{took the}} World Kickboxing Network (WKN) Intercontinental Welterweight (-69.9kg/154lb) Oriental Championship on January 31, 2009 {{when he stopped}} David Javakhia with a liver kick inside the opening stanza in Turin, Italy. On March 14, 2009 at [...] in Milan, he scored his first win over a truly elite fighter, taking a points victory against Andy Souwer. Using just about {{everything}} in his arsenal to keep Andy Souwer off-balance {{and out of his}} range, Petrosyan was seemingly in control of the exchanges. However, the fight got dramatic when the judges unexpectedly ruled it a draw after three rounds, sending the fight into an extension round to decide the winner. Things got even more heated when Souwer was dropped by a punch in the extension round and referee Joop Ubeda declined to give him a count. In the end, the judges <b>saw</b> <b>things</b> the way of the Italian and gave him the unanimous decision, in what was considered a major upset.|$|E
