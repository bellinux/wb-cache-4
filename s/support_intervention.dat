25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War I a number of socialist parties initially supported the war when it began in August 1914.

The Italian Liberal Party, under the leadership of Paolo Boselli, promoted intervention in the war {{on the side of the}} Allies and used the Dante Alighieri Society to promote Italian nationalism.

The Italian Socialist Party purged itself of pro-war nationalist members, including Mussolini. Mussolini, a syndicalist who supported the war on grounds of irredentist claims on Italian-populated regions of Austria-Hungary, formed the pro-interventionist Il Popolo d'Italia and the Fasci Rivoluzionario d'Azione Internazionalista ("Revolutionary Fasci for International Action") in October 1914 that later developed into the Fasci di Combattimento in 1919, the origin of fascism.

Background: Integrated evidence on self-management <b>support</b> <b>interventions</b> in chronically ill people with low socio-economic status is lacking. Design: Systematic literature review. Data sources: Cochrane database of trials, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Joanna Briggs Institute Library were searched (2000 - 2013).

40|$|Background: Dementia is a {{life-threatening}} disease, requiring a palliative care approach where supporting informal caregivers {{in managing the}} symptoms and problems related to the dementia should be part of. However, {{it is not clear}} which self-management <b>support</b> <b>interventions</b> are most effective. Aims: To synthesise evidence from previous systematic reviews on self-management <b>support</b> <b>interventions</b> for informal caregivers of persons with dementia. Methods: This systematic meta-review followed the PRISMA Statement. Searches were conducted in Pubmed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Embase and PsycINFO. A two-step selection was performed: (1) screening based on titles/abstracts and (2) screening based on full-text. Methodological quality was assessed by the Quality Assessment Checklist for reviews. Interventions were grouped using an earlier developed categorisation of self-management, covering 5 intervention targets: (1) relationship with family, (2) maintaining an active lifestyle, (3) psychological wellbeing, (4) techniques to cope with memory changes and (5) information about dementia. Results: 10 systematic reviews were included. Strong evidence exists for self-management <b>support</b> <b>interventions</b> focusing on family relationship in relieving caregiver burden. There is moderate evidence that self-management <b>support</b> <b>interventions</b> targeting psychological wellbeing contribute to a reduction of depressive symptoms. Last, strong evidence was found that interventions targeting ‘information about dementia’ increase well-being, and moderate evidence was found for a decrease of depression.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Although an {{increasing}} number of decision <b>support</b> <b>interventions</b> for patients (including decision aids) are produced, few make explicit use of theory. We argue the importance of using theory to guide design. The aim of this work was to address this theory-practice gap and to examine how a range of selected decision-making theories could inform the design and evaluation of decision <b>support</b> <b>interventions.</b> METHODS: We reviewed the decision-making literature and selected relevant theories. We assessed their key principles, theoretical pathways and predictions in order to determine how they could inform the design of two core components of decision <b>support</b> <b>interventions,</b> namely, information and deliberation components and to specify theory-based outcome measures. RESULTS: Eight theories were selected: (1) the expected utility theory; (2) the conflict model of decision making; (3) prospect theory; (4) fuzzy-trace theory; (5) the differentiation and consolidation theory; (6) the ecological rationality theory; (7) the rational-emotional model of decision avoidance; and finally, (8) the Attend, React, Explain, Adapt model of affective forecasting. Some theories have strong relevance to the information design (e. g. prospect theory); some are more relevant to deliberation processes (conflict theory, differentiation theory and ecological validity). None of the theories in isolation was sufficient to inform the design of all the necessary components of decision <b>support</b> <b>interventions.</b> It was also clear that most work in theory-building has focused on explaining or describing how humans think rather than on how tools could be designed to help humans make good decisions. It is not surprising therefore that a large theory-practice gap exists as we consider decision support for patients. There was no relevant theory that integrated all the necessary contributions to the task of making good decisions in collaborative interactions. DISCUSSION: Initiatives such as the International Patient Decision Aids Standards Collaboration influence standards for the design of decision <b>support</b> <b>interventions.</b> However, this analysis points to the need to undertake more work in providing theoretical foundations for these interventions...|$|R

The objective of this meta-review was to synthesize evidence from previous systematic reviews about professional self-management <b>support</b> <b>interventions</b> for this group. Methods: In March 2014, searches were conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Embase and PsycINFO. The PRISMA Statement was followed. Interventions were grouped using Martin’s targets of self-management, covering 5 targets: relationship with family, maintaining an active lifestyle, psychological wellbeing, techniques to cope with memory changes and information about dementia. Using an evidence synthesis, the outcomes from the included interventions were synthesized and conclusions were drawn {{about the level of}} evidence for the effectiveness of interventions within each target. Results: Ten high-quality systematic reviews were selected. Evidence exists for the effectiveness of professional self-management <b>support</b> <b>interventions</b> targeting psychological wellbeing on stress and social outcomes of informal caregivers. In addition, evidence exists for the effectiveness of interventions targeting information on ability/knowledge.

The changes required for an intervention to meet the proposed certification standards were relatively minor. There was considerable variation between raters' mean scores.
