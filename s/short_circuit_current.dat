25|$|The {{fill factor}} is {{the ratio of the}} actual maximum {{obtainable}} power to the product of the open circuit voltage and <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>current.</b> This is a key parameter in evaluating performance. In 2009, typical commercial solar cells had a fill factor > 0.70. Grade B cells were usually between 0.4 and 0.7. Cells with a high fill factor have a low equivalent series resistance and a high equivalent shunt resistance, so less of the current produced by the cell is dissipated in internal losses.|$|E
25|$|However, in {{the typical}} circuit, the spark gap's short circuiting action {{prevents}} high-frequency oscillations from 'backing up' into the supply transformer. In the alternate circuit, high amplitude high frequency oscillations that appear across the capacitor also are applied to the supply transformer's winding. This can induce corona discharges between turns that weaken and eventually destroy the transformer's insulation. Experienced Tesla coil builders almost exclusively use the top circuit, often augmenting it with low pass filters (resistor and capacitor (RC) networks) between the supply transformer and spark gap to help protect the supply transformer. This is especially important when using transformers with fragile high-voltage windings, such as neon sign transformers (NSTs). Regardless of which configuration is used, the HV transformer must be of a type that self-limits its secondary current by means of internal leakage inductance. A normal (low leakage inductance) high-voltage transformer must use an external limiter (sometimes called a ballast) to limit current. NSTs are designed to have high leakage inductance to limit their <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>current</b> to a safe level.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{defining}} term in {{the overall}} behavior of a solar cell is the fill factor (FF). This is the [...] available power at the maximum power point (Pm) divided by the open circuit voltage (VOC) and the <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>current</b> (ISC): ...|$|E
30|$|The faults {{of power}} {{systems can be}} {{effectively}} cleared, provided that the peak value of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> is limited below the interrupting capacity of circuit breakers. Therefore, nodal three-phase <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> are selected as the metric. By limiting the <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> below the safety threshold, the security of power systems is guaranteed.|$|R
3000|$|... 1) A new {{transmission}} network expansion planning model with embedded constraints of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> and N- 1 security is proposed in this paper. In this model, {{the constraints of}} <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> are explicitly incorporated. Thus, the optimal planning results can not only satisfy N- 1 security of transmission systems, but also limit the <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> below the safety threshold.|$|R
30|$|In {{existing}} literature, while incorporating N- 1 constraints into transmission expansion {{models is}} common practice [18, 19, 20, 21, 22], embedding constraints of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> into transmission expansion planning models is not thoroughly discussed. Since <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> have strong nonlinear relation with decision variables of candidate transmission lines, current power grid planning models have defects of heavy computational burden and low solution accuracy. In an actual power grid planning project, instead of embedding constraints in the grid planning model, <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> are calculated after determining {{the power grid}} planning result. This is an open-loop approach in which <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> are checked manually. Once the <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> are excessive, the power grid planning result needs modifying according to artificial experience. The major drawback of this procedure is low efficiency and loss of optimality. Therefore, current power grid planning model can merely guarantee N- 1 security. A model that can ensure both <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> constraints and N- 1 security needs investigating.|$|R
2500|$|Complete {{suppression}} of the parasitic thyristor action and the resultant non-latch-up IGBT operation for the entire device operation range was achieved by A. Nakagawa et al. in 1984. The non-latch-up design concept was filed for US patents. To test the lack of latch-up, the prototype 1200V IGBTs were directly connected without any loads across a 600V constant voltage source and were switched on for 25 microseconds. The entire 600V was dropped across the device and a large <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>current</b> flowed. The devices successfully withstood this severe condition. This was the first demonstration of so-called [...] "short-circuit-withstanding-capability" [...] in IGBTs. Non-latch-up IGBT operation was ensured, for the first time, for the entire device operation range. In this sense, the non-latch-up IGBT proposed by Hans W. Becke and Carl F. Wheatley was realized by A. Nakagawa et al. in 1984. Products of non-latch-up IGBTs were first commercialized by Toshiba in 1985.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>current</b> {{available}} on the electrical outlets is often tested when inspecting new electrical installations {{to make sure that}} the <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>current</b> is within reasonable limits. A high <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>current</b> on the outlet also shows that the resistance from the electrical panel to the outlet is low, so there won't be an unacceptably high voltage drop on the wires under normal load.|$|E
30|$|An {{approach}} of transmission network expansion planning with embedded constraints of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> and N- 1 security is proposed in this paper. The model, based on DC power flow, is established for transmission network expansion planning. By {{means of an}} iterative process, the linearization of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> is realized. According to the AC power flow, the error of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> caused by linearization is reduced by compensation factors. The case study shows {{that it can be}} achieved via the proposed approach that N- 1 security is satisfied and <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> are limited below the safety threshold after expansion planning. Hopefully, the proposed approach could provide new thought for power system transmission planning.|$|R
30|$|According to {{the results}} shown in Fig.  4, the <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> of the result of M 1 exceed the safety threshold, which further {{indicates}} that unreasonable transmission network expansion planning cannot ensure that <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> are below the safety threshold.|$|R
30|$|The {{continuous}} {{increase of}} <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> threatens {{the security of}} power grids. A higher level of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> imposes a stricter requirement on electrical equipment in power systems. If the interrupting capacity is insufficient to effectively clear faults, the impact of faults may spread to wider areas, jeopardizing {{the security of the}} whole power system. Thus, how to limit <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> of power systems in the planning phase has been an imperative and critical task for system operators.|$|R

50|$|In {{designing}} domestic power installations the {{short-circuit current}} {{available on the}} electrical outlets should not be too high or too low. The effect of too high <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>current</b> is discussed in the previous paragraph. The <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>current</b> should be around 20 times the rating of the circuit to ensure the branch circuit protection clears a fault quickly. Quick disconnecting is needed, because in live-ground short circuit the grounding pin potential on the power outlet can rise compared to the local earth (concrete floor, water pipe etc.) during short circuit to a dangerous voltage, which needs {{to be shut down}} quickly for safety. If the <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>current</b> is lower than this figure, special precautions need to be taken {{to make sure that the}} system is safe; those usually include using a residual current device (sometimes called a ground fault interrupter) for extra protection.|$|E
3000|$|... 2) By {{constructing}} an {{iterative process}} in calculating <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents,</b> the linearization method based on DC power flow is developed {{to reduce the}} nonlinearity brought on by <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents.</b> Hence, the transmission network expansion planning model is converted to an MILP problem, which can be efficiently optimized.|$|R
40|$|The {{commissioning}} of Southern Hami-Zhengzhou ± 800 kV UHVDC transmission {{project has}} im-portant significance to heighten operation reliability, transfer capability and supply electric abili-ty of Henan power grid. However, <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> of 500 kV buses in the Center of Henan are almost {{close to the}} operation upper limitation. In order to decrease the <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> ef-fectively, it’s necessary to strengthen the network structure of Center of Henan power grid and calculate <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents.</b> Two schemes of strengthening the network structure of Center of Henan power grid are studied. The calculated values of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> of some important 500 kV buses in the two schemes are still bigger than excepted. According to the latest Plan of State Grid, Yubei UHV substation and Zhumadian UHV substation located in Henan power grid. The calculated values of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> of some important 500 kV buses with the commission-ing of Yubei UHV and Zhumadian UHV are qualified. So, reasonable network structure with UHV is suitable to heighten transfer capability and supply electric ability of Henan power grid...|$|R
30|$|Up until now, {{the excess}} of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> {{has been quite}} a common problem in many regions [1, 2, 3, 4]. For instance, in China, the {{installed}} generation capacity of Shanghai power grid and power interchange with external power grids are growing rapidly during these years, resulting in {{a significant increase in}} <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> of 500  kV buses [5]. In Japan, 500  kV power networks form the backbone of the transmission system. The <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> interrupting capacity is 63 or 50 kA generally. With the growth of the power grid scale, the capital region around Tokyo is faced with the problem of excessive <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> [6]. In Iran, the <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> level will exceed the capacity of existing circuit breakers as a result of installing two new generating stations by 2015 [7].|$|R
5000|$|Where an {{industrial}} system {{is fed from}} an electrical utility, the short circuit level {{at the point of}} connection may be specified, often with minimum and maximum values or values to be expected after system growth. This allows calculation by {{an industrial}} customer of its internal fault levels within its plant. If the prospective <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>current</b> from the utility source is very large compared to the customer's system size, an [...] "infinite bus" [...] is assumed, with zero effective internal impedance; the only limit to the prospective <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>current</b> is then the impedances after the defined [...] "infinite bus".|$|E

30|$|As one {{can observe}} from Fig.  3 and Fig.  4, {{the result of}} M 2 can not only ensure N- 1 {{security}} of the power system, but also limit the <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> below the safety threshold, realizing transmission network expansion planning with embedded constraints of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> and N- 1 security.|$|R
30|$|According to the {{calculation}} method of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> mentioned in Section  2, the three-phase <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> are reciprocals of self-impedances. The impedance matrix {{can be derived}} from the admittance matrix after inversion. Although the admittance matrix is the linear expression of decision variables of candidate transmission lines, however, self-impedances of the impedance matrix have strong nonlinearity property with cross-multiplying terms of decision variables in both denominators and numerators. Therefore, this calculation method makes the planning model a complex mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. Since it is a difficult task to solve the planning model, a specific method for linearizing <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> will be proposed in Section  4.|$|R
30|$|An {{approach}} of transmission network expansion planning with embedded constraints of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> and N- 1 security is proposed in this paper. The problem {{brought on by}} the strong nonlinearity property of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> is solved with a linearization method based on the DC power flow. The model can be converted to a mixed-integer linear programming problem, realizing the optimization of planning model that considers the constraints of linearized <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> and N- 1 security. To compensate the error caused by the assumptions of DC power flow, the compensation factor is proposed. With this factor, an iterative algorithm that can compensate the linearization error is then presented. The case study based on the IEEE 118 -bus system shows that the proposed model and approach can be utilized to: optimize the construction strategy of transmission lines; ensure the N- 1 security of the network; and effectively limit the <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> of the system.|$|R

50|$|Perhaps {{the easiest}} {{practical}} {{method is to}} calculate the (linear) network open circuit voltage and <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>current</b> and plot these on the transfer function of the non-linear device.

30|$|In this way, linear {{constraints}} of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> can be embedded into the transmission network expansion model.|$|R
30|$|According to {{the case}} study, the {{planning}} result of M 2 is superior to that of M 1. This verifies that the model and approach of transmission network expansion planning with embedded constraints of <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> and N- 1 security proposed in this paper can be utilized to guarantee N- 1 security of the power system and limit the <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>currents</b> below the safety threshold as well, achieving both security and economy of the power system planning.|$|R

Isolation cells are {{specially}} designed for low <b>short</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>current</b> when input is at threshold voltage level. Isolation control signals are provided by the power gating controller. Isolation of the signals of a switchable module is essential to preserve design integrity. Usually a simple OR or AND logic can function as an output isolation device. Multiple state retention schemes are available in practice to preserve the state before a module shuts down. The simplest technique is to scan out the register values into a memory before shutting down a module. When the module wakes up, the values are scanned back from the memory.|$|E
