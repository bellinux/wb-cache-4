All goods entering or leaving Alaska had to be transported by American carriers and shipped to Seattle prior to further shipment, making Alaska dependent on Washington.

500|$|Although the {{majority}} of the tribe decided to follow Keokuk's lead, about 800 Sauks—roughly one-sixth of the tribe—chose instead to resist American expansion. Black Hawk, a war captain who had fought against the United States in the War of 1812 and was now in his 60s, emerged as the leader of this faction in 1829. Like Keokuk, Black Hawk was not a civil chief, but he became Keokuk's primary rival for influence within the tribe. Black Hawk had actually signed a treaty in May 1816 that affirmed the disputed 1804 land cession, but he insisted that what had been written down was different from what had been spoken at the treaty conference. According to Black Hawk, the [...] "whites were in the habit of <b>saying</b> <b>one</b> thing to the Indians and putting another thing down on paper." ...|$|E
500|$|Declared [...] "eyesore of the year" [...] by The Philadelphia Inquirer in 1994, the burned, empty {{tower was}} {{an embarrassment to}} the city {{according}} to an editorial in The Inquirer. The editorial said the feeling only became worse after One Meridian Plaza {{could be seen in}} the background in the film Philadelphia. The fire left the area a commercial void. Nearly every major store in the area closed and property values fell. Neighboring property owners, such as the owner of the damaged buildings behind One Meridian Plaza, were waiting for a decision {{on the future of the}} building before going through with their own development plans. In 1996 the city of Philadelphia sued E/R Partners <b>saying</b> <b>One</b> Meridian Plaza was an environmental hazard and should be demolished or repaired. The city and Mayor Ed Rendell were afraid that when E/R Partners settled with Aetna they would take the money and leave the building unfixed.|$|E

2500|$|One {{commentator}} {{laid out}} the likely outcome should the Matteen case not be judged on its merits, <b>saying</b> <b>one</b> day a non-Christian would appear before a North Carolina judge and would [...] "create an impasse in court when he refuses to swear on the Bible and declines to affirm an oath, insisting he {{should be allowed to}} place his hand on the Quran or some other holy book and promise before his God to tell the truth". The judge could then [...] "hold the uncooperative witness in contempt, in effect punishing a person who simply asks that his religious beliefs be granted the same respect as those of a Christian. ... While holding the witness in contempt, the judge also could bar the testimony that would have been offered—thereby jeopardizing the case of one party or the other. ...Or the judge could let the witness testify without swearing or affirming to tell the truth.

Darius is bound by the secret of confession and says nothing, to the great annoyance of LeBrun. When MacLeod visits Darius again later, Darius recollects having found St. Cloud hiding from the police in his church long ago. St. Cloud {{would have had to}} face guillotine for having stolen a piece of jewelry. Darius comments, [...] "You know, that's hardly a crime to die for."

2500|$|The event sparked {{an intense}} {{international}} controversy, with Iran condemning the U.S. attack. In mid-July 1988, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati asked the United Nations Security Council {{to condemn the}} United States saying the U.S. attack [...] "could {{not have been a}} mistake" [...] and was a [...] "criminal act", an [...] "atrocity" [...] and a [...] "massacre". George H. W. Bush, at the time vice president of the United States in the Reagan administration, defended his country at the United Nations by arguing that the U.S. attack had been a wartime incident and that the crew of Vincennes had acted appropriately to the situation. The Soviet Union asked the U.S. to withdraw from the area and supported efforts by the Security Council to end the Iran–Iraq War. Most of the remainder of the 13 delegates who spoke supported the U.S. position, <b>saying</b> <b>one</b> of the problems was that a 1987 resolution to end the Iran-Iraq war had been ignored. Following the debate, Security Council Resolution 616 was passed expressing [...] "deep distress" [...] over the U.S. attack and [...] "profound regret" [...] for the loss of human lives, and stressing the need to end the Iran–Iraq War as resolved in 1987.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2013, it {{was said}} that Ava DuVernay had signed on to direct the film for Pathé UK and Plan B, and that she was {{revising}} the script with the original screenwriter, Paul Webb. DuVernay estimated that she re-wrote 90 percent of Webb's original script. Those revisions included rewriting King's speeches, because, in 2009, King's estate licensed them to DreamWorks and Warner Bros. for an untitled project to be produced by Steven Spielberg. Subsequent negotiations between those companies and Selmas producers did not lead to an agreement. DuVernay drafted alternative speeches that evoke the historic ones without violating the copyright. She recalled spending hours listening to King's words while hiking the canyons of Los Angeles. While she did not think she would [...] "get anywhere close to just the beauty and that nuance of his speech patterns", she did identify some of King's basic structure, such as a tendency to speak in triplets (<b>saying</b> <b>one</b> thing in three different ways). In early 2014, Oprah Winfrey came on board as a producer along with Pitt, and by February 25 Paramount Pictures was in final negotiations for the US and Canadian distribution rights. On April 4, 2014, it was announced that Bradford Young would be the director of photography of the film.|$|E
2500|$|The Arizona Hispanic Chamber of Commerce opposed {{both the}} law and the idea of boycotting, saying the latter would only hurt small {{businesses}} and the state’s economy, which was already badly damaged by the collapse of real estate prices and the late-2000s recession. [...] Other state business groups opposed a boycott for the same reasons. [...] Religious groups opposed to the law split on whether a boycott was advisable, with Bishop Carcaño <b>saying</b> <b>one</b> [...] "would only extend our recession by three to five years and hit those who are poorest among us." [...] Representative Grijalva said he wanted to keep a boycott restricted to conferences and conventions and only for a limited time: [...] "The idea is to send a message, not grind down the state economy." [...] Governor Brewer said that she was disappointed and surprised at the proposed boycotts – [...] "How could further punishing families and businesses, large and small, be a solution viewed as constructive?" [...] – but said that the state would not back away from the law. [...] President Obama took no position on the matter, saying, [...] "I'm the president of the United States, I don't endorse boycotts or not endorse boycotts. That's something that private citizens can make a decision about." ...|$|E
