5000|$|Elandsrand mine is 8 km from Carltonville near Western Deep Levels to the East and Deelkraal to the West. It has twin shafts {{very close}} to each other, one being a {{production}} shaft, the other a <b>service</b> <b>shaft</b> for men and equipment. The incident trapping the miners occurred in the <b>service</b> <b>shaft</b> when a 15 meter section of compressed air pipe burst {{and fell to the}} shaft bottom, in the process damaging steel shaft guides, and electrical lines which cut off power to the hoist on the service cage. Because the <b>service</b> <b>shaft</b> became inoperable, miners were brought up using the production shaft, after changing out the skips for a cage. [...] The cages in the <b>service</b> <b>shaft</b> are of a 3 deck configuration with a capacity of about 150 personnel, and are capable of operating at speeds of 50 km per hour. The service cage {{would not be able to}} fit into the hoisting compartments in the production shaft due to different shaft sizes, and different compartment configurations. Due to this fact a smaller cage with a slower hoisting speed was used in the skip compartments. As a result evacution of the trapped miners took longer than had the miners been able to use the <b>service</b> <b>shaft</b> as an egress. Eventually all the miners were rescued unharmed from the mine.|$|E

Digitally manufactured building designs made from wood can help produce extraordinary cores for multistorey timber buildings. This study aims at investigating the possibilities of such novel building cores. Based on the thesis that contemporary technologies supporting the production of large-scale timber structures offer unique opportunities to redefine the visceral parts of multi-storey buildings, which in turn has architectural effects throughout, the research shows how a combination of mass production and mass customisation strategies can be applied to timber architecture. The end result is a novel design and production strategy based on innovative manufacturing methods that give rise to new construction strategies, new structural ideas, new buildings, and new ways of using those buildings Godkänd; 2014; 20141023 (andbra) </p...|$|R

The [...] finger block was seen as a tower block laid on its side- instead of lifts and <b>service</b> <b>shafts</b> there was the internal walkway. [...] It was intended to keep the housing as compact as possible thus freeing up more green space in between. The units were of different sizes and slotted together like lego blocks. The finger blocks were built above garages on a deck, along the centre of the deck was a covered walkway, which provided the street in the sky. On either side of the street were flats and the stair columns that rose to the flats above. The flats themselves were grouped in blocks and projected, joining over the walkway. The finger blocks were very close to the annual disturbances in Notting Hill, and the walkways provided escape routes that the police were unable to control. In 1992, the finger blocks were refurbished and wall erected that segmented the walkways and required pass key access- destroying the original design concept and one of the finger blocks unique features.|$|R

As {{a consequence of the}} incident, most of the 30 fuel assemblies put into the cleaning tank have seriously damaged. At the Institute of Nuclear Techniques, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, several CFD investigations were performed concerning the course of the incident, the post incidental conditions and the recovery work. The main reason of the incident can be originated from the defective design of the cleaning tank which resulted in the insufficient cooling of the system. First, the CFD calculations, with which the thermal-hydraulic deficiencies of the design were revealed, are presented in this paper. This investigation clearly showed how as strong temperature stratification could develop inside the cleaning tank that it was able to block the coolant flow through the fuel assemblies. After the blocking of the flow, the coolant started to boil, and the assemblies became uncovered. The temperature of the surfaces of the fuel assemblies rose above 1000 ºC.

40|$|Modern {{ships are}} means of {{transport}} which, during their entire operational lifespan, need to convey cargo and/or passengers in a safe and reliable way, without jeopardising their safety, and with least possible adverse impacts on the marine environment. The ship’s safety and functionality directly depend on the reliability of her propulsion system, the shafting being the essential unit of the system. The functionality of the ship’s shafting considerably depends on its correct installation. Installation of the ship propulsion shafting {{is an integral part}} of the overall positioning (alignment) procedure. Shafting alignment is performed in several stages, starting with the shaft line design, and includes calculating the elastic line and bearing loads, installation of shafting parts onboard ship in compliance with the calculation results, and verifying the alignment results. Procedures are different for ships in service and newly built ships. This paper deals with specific features of the propulsion shafting alignment that is carried out while a ship in service is being converted for a general reason. Unlike a newly built ship, an existing ship imposes additional constraints that should be dealt with in the calculation stage of the process as well as during shafting installation and alignment verification. A calculation approach for ships in service is always different, having specific features from case to case, depending on what is changed and what remains unchanged during the conversion of the ship. The same goes for the implementation and verification of the achieved results. The purpose of this paper is to underline the difference, its contribution being in suggesting the procedure to be followed in case of conversion of an existing vessel.

40|$|AbstractAn {{axle shaft}} of fork lift failed at {{operation}} within 296 h of <b>service.</b> The <b>shaft</b> transmits torque from discrepancy to wheel through planetary gear arrangement. A section of fractured axle shaft made of induction-hardened steel was analyzed {{to determine the}} root cause of the failure. Optical microscopies as well as field emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FEG-SEM) along with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were carried out to characterize the microstructure. Hardness profile throughout the cross-section was evaluated by micro-hardness measurements. Chemical analysis indicated that the shaft was made of 42 CrMo 4 steel grade as per specification. Microstructural analysis and micro-hardness profile revealed that the shaft was improperly heat treated resulting in a brittle case, where crack was found to initiate from the case in a brittle mode in contrast to ductile mode within the core. This behaviour was related to differences in microstructure, which was observed to be martensitic within the case with a micro-hardness equivalent to 735 HV, and a mixture of non-homogeneous structure of pearlite and ferrite within the core with a hardness of 210 HV. The analysis suggests that the fracture initiated from the martensitic case as brittle mode due to improper heat treatment process (high hardness).
