40|$|Abstract — With {{the recent}} {{growth of the}} <b>Social</b> <b>Web,</b> an {{emerging}} challenge is how we can integrate information from the heterogeneity of current <b>Social</b> <b>Web</b> sites to improve semantic access to the information and knowledge across the entire World Wide Web, the Web. Interoperability across the <b>Social</b> <b>Web</b> sites make the simplest of inferences {{based on data from}} different sites challenging. Even if such data were interoperable across multiple <b>Social</b> <b>Web</b> sites, the ability of meaningful inferences of a collective intelligence [1] system depends on both its ability to marshal such semantic data, as well as its ability to accurately understand and precisely respond to queries from its users. This paper presents the architecture for Social Sifter, an agent-based, collective intelligence system for assimilating information and knowledge across the <b>Social</b> <b>Web.</b> A health recommender system prototype was developed using the Social Sifter architecture, which recommends treatments, prevention advice, therapies for ailments, and doctors and hospitals based on shared experiences available on the <b>Social</b> <b>Web...</b>|$|R

Especially research regarding communication behaviour on the <b>social</b> <b>web</b> as well as <b>social</b> <b>web</b> technologies has currently progressed well. However, in innovation research, <b>social</b> <b>web</b> technologies are currently primarily used to integrate users into the company’s innovation process, for example through company user toolkits or company innovation communities. In those cases users were excluded from their normal <b>social</b> <b>web</b> environment and integrated into a company’s environment, a sort of laboratory environment. Despite this, the present research project will use the natural behaviour, comments and discussions of users within their <b>social</b> <b>web</b> environment to develop and apply a new mixed-method approach with the aim to deduce tasks {{and characteristics of}} innovative end users on the <b>social</b> <b>web.</b> To apply the mixed-method approach within a longitudinal case study and to deduce statements and regularities regarding the innovation process on the <b>social</b> <b>web,</b> it was possible to analyse the end user developer online forum of one of the leading open source CRM software technologies. Based on this analysis, the assumptions from an extensive literature analysis could be verified and extended: it could be shown that the expected single innovative user does not exist.

Although the disregard of technology inventors and designers for the users of ICTs has resulted in disjunctures between ICTs and users, users have refused to become mere agents of the designers. Individual users have developed their own uses of ICTs based on the complex webs of relations and meanings in which they function as social actors. Instead of adjusting these webs to new ICTs, they have fit the ICTs into their preexisting <b>social</b> <b>webs,</b> often resulting in imaginative and creative uses for new technologies, not envisaged by the original designers.

Projected graphs, linking the agents of only one guild, are obtained from the original bipartite graph. The corresponding evolution of its statistical properties is also studied. An example of a biological mutualistic network is analyzed in great detail, and it is found that the model provides a very good quantitative fitting of its properties.

This paper {{considers the}} significance of Tuberculosis (TB) -related stigma and stigmatising acts in areas of Khayelitsha Township in Cape Town, South Africa. Data is drawn from three months of in-depth participant observation, interviews and support group sessions. Stigma is a moral process which emerges within <b>social</b> <b>webs</b> of meaning making. By focusing on patient narratives and local illness transmission models (ITMs) both 'enacted' and 'felt' stigma are explored. Three themes emerged during fieldwork: the singularity of dirt {{as a mode of}} TB transmission, the paradoxical visibility of the face hidden by the clinical mask, and the ordering/disordering intentions of those who gossip. Utilising Das' (1990) idea of 'organising images' to understand these themes, it is evident they are each imbued with power and meaning within local worlds and thus extend our understanding of stigma and stigmatisation. I argue for the theoretical expansion of stigma through employing alternative literatures, such as the anthropology of violence, witchcraft and narrative studies. In addition, new methods need to be explored which mirror the adversity faced by those living with TB. In this work I suggest 'provoking' stigma is the most effective manner to understand its effects...|$|E
