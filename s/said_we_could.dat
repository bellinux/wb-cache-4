500|$|Such was the {{likelihood}} of Manchester United going on to retain the title, bookmaker Fred Done paid out on punters with two months of the season left. Arsenal steadily closed the gap, however, and victory against Wimbledon in March 1998 set up a title clash between themselves and the reigning champions. Wenger in the lead up to the game maintained {{it was possible for}} Arsenal to win the league, stating [...] "two or three weeks ago, the title was just a dream for us and people laughed when I <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> still do it". He suggested Manchester United were responsible for making the title race [...] "interesting". At Old Trafford, Overmars scored the decisive goal to give Arsenal a 1–0 win. The victory was followed by nine consecutive league wins, the last of which was a home fixture against Everton that secured Arsenal's status as champions. Wenger became the first foreign manager to win the double, when his team beat Newcastle United in the 1998 FA Cup Final.|$|E
2500|$|This is {{a concept}} similar to Anselm's that we owe a debt of honor to God, with a {{critical}} difference: While Anselm <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> never pay this because any good we could do was owed to God anyway, Aquinas says {{that in addition to}} our due of obedience we can make up for our debt through acts of penance [...] "man owes God all that he is able to give him...over and above which he can offer something by way of satisfaction". Unlike Anselm, Aquinas claims that we can make satisfaction for our own sin, and that our problem is not our personal sin, but original sin. [...] "Original sin...is an infection of human nature itself, so that, unlike actual sin, it could not be expiated by the satisfaction of a mere man." [...] Thus Christ, as the [...] "second Adam," [...] does penance in our place – paying the debt of our original sin. Why does he do that? By love. The whole of the work of redemption begins with God’s love: “God so loved the world that he gave his only Son” (Jn 3:16).|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} {{to set the}} game four thousand years before [...] {{was one of the}} first details about the game made known. LucasArts gave BioWare a choice of settings for the game. [...] "LucasArts came to us and said that we could do an [...] game," [...] BioWare CEO Raymond Muzyka said. [...] "Or LucasArts <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> go 4,000 years back, which is a period that's hardly been covered before." [...] BioWare chose to set the game four thousand years before the films as it gave them greater creative freedom. They aimed to create content similar to that from the films but different enough to be a definite precursor. Concept work had to be sent to [...] "the ranch" [...] to be approved for use. Muzyka noted that very little of their content was rejected: [...] "It was more like, 'Can you just make his head like this rather than like that.' So it was all very feasible. There were good suggestions made and they made the game better, so we were happy to do them. It was a good process really and I think we were pleasantly surprised how easy LucasArts was to work with." [...] Zeschuk said that [...] "Overall, we were really happy with the results. We felt like we had enough freedom to truly create something wonderful." ...|$|E

60|$|Dumont humbly {{suggested}} {{here that}} <b>we</b> <b>could</b> at all events {{act on the}} principle that guided Adam and Eve in the formation of their first water-mill, and find out by experiment.

6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Joram. 'As you <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> make {{a little}} trip of it, and go over together, if it was done, Minnie and me--and you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{only knew}} what they <b>said,</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have such happy times together. How can I ever learn?" [...] sighed Betty, as she was driving Daisy home one day at sunset.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, mother, {{that may}} be; but I bethink me now {{of two or}} three times when means have been wanting for the {{relieving}} of the poor, and the ransoming of captives, and the support of apostles, when <b>we</b> have <b>said</b> that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> give no more." ...|$|R
3000|$|... “We then {{discussed}} the rest and then <b>said</b> that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> definitely do something there. … We soon reached {{the decision that}} there simply {{has to be a}} new platform. … And this major project was created from this working group…. They were all really hooked on this subject.” [...]...|$|R

6000|$|... "Say, you old double-decked pirate," [...] {{he called}} joyfully to Dodson, [...] "you <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do it--you got a head for {{financing}} that knocks the horns off of anything in Arizona." ...|$|E
6000|$|I <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> make a London {{home and}} see Dora sometimes, {{trying to make}} him {{understand}} that he might reckon on me as his sister friend, but the answer was, [...] "I don't count on that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Nares reflectively, [...] "I almost think you're right. Still, he may, after all, have {{something}} different in his mind. As you <b>said,</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> probably hold the hut, {{and we are}} not out of the village yet." ...|$|E

60|$|The guard <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> {{take any}} seats we pleased; {{and when we}} got in we found there was only two or three people in it, and we chose two nice armchairs, hung up our wraps, and made {{ourselves}} comfortable and cosey.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, father," [...] said Rollo, [...] "that is what I meant, when I <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> {{not stand}} up straight. I meant the houses. I read in a book that houses would be blown away, if the {{gravitation}} did not hold them down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{told her}} so! We told her so; {{but she only}} waved her feelers, and <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> all lay eggs like Queens if we chose. And I'm afraid lots of the weaker sisters believe her, {{and are trying to}} do it. So unsettling!" ...|$|E

Marilla says we can have all that are left on the tree. Marilla is a very generous woman. She <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have fruit cake and cherry {{preserves}} for tea. But it isn't good manners to tell your company {{what you are going to}} give them to eat, so I won't tell you what she <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> have to drink. Only it begins with an R and a C and it's bright red color. I love bright red drinks, don't you? They taste twice as good as any other color." ...|$|E
60|$|He spoke like {{an honest}} man, and {{yet on the}} instant there came to my mind the {{question}} as to whether he had any traitorous intent in thus advising us, after having much the same as <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not hope to succeed in our purpose.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Never minded it a bit. Black Hawk <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> live on {{the horses}} several days and still travel before they felt it. But by another morning we found the buffalo, and I shot the one whose head is in my box, ready to hang up and scare brats into fits. He's a fierce old fellow, you bet.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then I {{suppose that}} little shed yonder fell down by itself?' <b>said</b> De Forest. <b>We</b> <b>could</b> see the bare and still smoking ruins, {{and hear the}} slag-pools crackle as they {{hardened}} and set.|$|R
60|$|It {{was a most}} unaccountable {{difficulty}} we had next; for <b>we</b> <b>could</b> {{not make}} them understand one word <b>we</b> <b>said,</b> nor <b>could</b> <b>we</b> understand one word ourselves that they <b>said.</b> <b>We</b> endeavoured by signs to ask them whence they came; but they could make nothing of it. We pointed to the great cabin, to the round-house, to the cook-room, then to our faces, to ask if they had no white men on board, and where they were gone; {{but they could not}} understand what we meant. On the other hand, they pointed to our boat and to their ship, asking questions as well as they could, and said a thousand things, and expressed themselves with great earnestness; but <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not understand a word of it all, or know what they meant by any of their signs.|$|R
2500|$|However, {{one senior}} manager at Grameenphone told Al Jazeera on the {{condition}} {{he would not be}} identified: [...] "The DGFI officer <b>said</b> that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> no longer advertise in either the Prothom Alo or the Daily Star, and that steps would be taken against us if we defied the order." [...] The warning was verbal and not put in writing, he said.|$|R
60|$|Then {{we talked}} about the money. It was a pretty good raise--twenty dollars apiece. Jim <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> take deck passage on a {{steamboat}} now, and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free States. He said twenty mile more warn't far for the raft to go, but he wished we was already there.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would rather}} not," [...] she said, getting {{up with a}} painful effort. [...] "I am awfully foolish, and I am so sorry that I broke down, but I felt so delighted that I could not help it. You <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> camp, safely, when we once got across the frontier. Would you mind doing so? For I don't think I could go much farther." ...|$|E
60|$|We rowed on {{all that}} day through the rain, and very melancholy work it was. We pretended, at first, that we enjoyed it. We {{said it was a}} change, and that we liked to see the river under all its {{different}} aspects. We <b>said</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not expect to have it all sunshine, nor should we wish it. We told each other that Nature was beautiful, even in her tears.|$|E
60|$|Poor thing! She {{began to}} cry {{as soon as she}} began to speak. Of course, we sat down and talked to her, and <b>said</b> {{everything}} <b>we</b> <b>could</b> think of to reassure her.
