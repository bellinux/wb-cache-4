5|$|After {{several months}} of stalemate, Philip finally {{advanced}} into Boeotia {{in an attempt to}} march on Thebes and Athens. Opposing him, and blocking the road near Chaeronea, was the allied Greek army, similar in size and occupying a <b>strong</b> <b>position.</b> Details of the ensuing battle are scarce, but after a long fight the Macedonians crushed both flanks of the allied line, which then dissolved into a rout.|$|E
5|$|Crucially, the Prussians did not {{retreat to}} the east, along their own lines of communication. Instead, they, too, fell back northwards—parallel to Wellington's line of march, still within {{supporting}} distance and in communication with him throughout. The Prussians rallied on Bülow's IV Corps, which had not been engaged at Ligny and was in a <b>strong</b> <b>position</b> south of Wavre.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 16th century, {{tensions}} grew between Protestant England and Catholic Spain, leading ultimately to the undeclared Anglo-Spanish War of 1585–1604. Spain {{was in a}} <b>strong</b> <b>position</b> to attack the south of England from its possessions in the Spanish Netherlands. New fortifications were erected along the Medway, including a chain stretched across {{the width of the}} river below Upnor Castle. The castle itself was poorly manned until Lord High Admiral Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham highlighted this and recommended that the garrison should be increased. By 1596, it was garrisoned by eighty men who were each paid eight pence per day (equivalent to £6 today).|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the outer}} {{defenses}} were gradually moved inward, thereby sacrificing a vital {{foothold in the}} steppe transitional zone. Despite the withdrawal from the steppe, the Ming military remained in a <b>strong</b> <b>position</b> against the nomads until the Tumu Crisis in 1449, which caused {{the collapse of the}} early Ming security system. Over half of the campaigning Chinese army perished in the conflict, while the Mongols captured the Zhengtong Emperor. This military debacle shattered the Chinese military might that had so impressed and given pause to the Mongols {{since the beginning of the}} dynasty, and caused the Ming to be on the defensive ever after.|$|E
5|$|On 13–14 May, German forces {{crossed the}} Meuse near Sedan using {{integrated}} land and air tactics {{that broke the}} morale of the French 55th Infantry Division, driving them out of the blockhouse line and allowing the Germans to gain a <b>strong</b> <b>position</b> from which to exploit the breakthrough. A progressive collapse of the French Second and Ninth Armies from 14 May to 17 May allowed German forces to move to the west of La Ferté, cutting La Ferté off from much of its mobile support.|$|E

5|$|Once the Allies had {{combined}} their forces, the Elector and Marsin {{moved their}} 40,000 troops into the entrenched camp between Dillingen and Lauingen {{on the north}} bank of the Danube. The Allied commanders– unwilling to attack such a <b>strong</b> <b>position</b> rendered impregnable by redoubts and inundations– passed round Dillingen to the north through Balmershofen and Armerdingen {{in the direction of}} Donauwörth. If captured, the bridgehead at Donauwörth (overlooked by the Schellenberg) would offer new communications with the friendly states in central Germany by way of Nördlingen and Nuremberg, as well as providing a good crossing-place over the Danube for re-supply when the Allies were south of the river.|$|E
5|$|The relief {{force of}} Clinton and Grey arrived at Newport on 1 September. Given {{that the threat}} was over, Clinton instead ordered Grey to raid several {{communities}} on the Massachusetts coast. Admiral Howe was unsuccessful in his bid {{to catch up with}} d'Estaing, who held a <b>strong</b> <b>position</b> at the Nantasket Roads when Howe arrived there on 30 August. Admiral Byron, who succeeded Howe as head of the New York station in September, was also unsuccessful in blockading d'Estaing: his fleet was scattered by a storm when it arrived off Boston, while d'Estaing sailed away, bound for the West Indies.|$|E
5|$|Against this fraught background, Philip {{started the}} siege of Perinthos in July 340 BC. Perinthos {{occupied}} a <b>strong</b> <b>position</b> on a hill rising to 56 meters, with its own port. Philip {{did not have a}} large enough fleet to blockade the port, meaning that Perinthos could be supplied from outside; Philip would therefore have to assault the city. Philip's engineers constructed siege towers (some allegedly 80 cubits high), battering rams and mines for the assault, and in a short time, a section of the wall was breached. However, fighting uphill through the city proved difficult, with the rings of houses providing impromptu defence lines for the Perinthians. Aid, both material and military, now began arriving at Perinthos; the Persian king ordered his satraps on the coast of Asia Minor to send money, food and weapons to the city, while the Byzantians sent a body of soldiers and their best generals.|$|E

5|$|At {{some point}} during his reign, Sigeberht abdicated his power to Ecgric and retired to lead a {{religious}} life within a monastery he had built for his own use. Bede does not name the location of Sigeberht's monastery, but later sources name it as Beodricesworth, afterwards called Bury St Edmunds. If that identification is accepted, the likely site was in the original precinct of the mediaeval abbey at Bury St Edmunds, probably the 'worth' or curtilage of Beodric after whom the place was originally named. The site occupied a <b>strong</b> <b>position</b> on {{the upper reaches of}} the Lark valley, which drains north-west into the Great Fen through important early settlements at Icklingham, Culford, West Stow and others. This was a line of access towards Ely, where a foundation of Saint Augustine may already have existed, and towards Soham, where Saint Felix is thought to have founded a monastery.|$|E
5|$|Australia had {{proceeded}} {{through the}} first two months of their tour of England undefeated. After winning 10 of the first 12 gamesthe other two being drawneight of these by an innings, they won the First Test by eight wickets. Between the Tests, they defeated Northamptonshire by an innings before drawing against Yorkshire. They crushed England by 409 runs in the Second Test at Lord's, Abefore defeating Surrey by ten wickets and crushing Gloucestershire by an innings and 363 runs, after amassing 774/7 declared, their highest score of the season. The Third Test was drawn amid rain interruptions that cost {{a day and a half}} of play; England had been in a <b>strong</b> <b>position,</b> having been 316 runs ahead with seven wickets in hand in their second innings when rain came at the end of the third day. Australia proceeded to claim a ten-wicket triumph over Middlesex in their only county game before the Fourth Test.|$|E
5|$|During {{the rest}} of the decade, the club won the league just once more in 1966–67. However, the 1970s saw Juventus further solidify their <b>strong</b> <b>position</b> in Italian football. Under former player Čestmír Vycpálek, they won the scudetto in 1971–72 and 1972–73, with players such as Roberto Bettega, Franco Causio and José Altafini {{breaking}} through. During {{the rest of}} the decade, they won the league twice more, with defender Gaetano Scirea contributing significantly. The later win was under Giovanni Trapattoni, who also led the club to their first ever major European title (the UEFA Cup) in 1977 and helped the club's domination continue on into {{the early part of the}} 1980s. During Trapattoni's tenure, many Juventus players also formed the backbone of the Italy national team during Enzo Bearzot's successful managerial era, including the 1978 World Cup, UEFA Euro 1980 and 1982 world champion squads.|$|E

5|$|England won {{the first}} Test with John Snow and David Brown {{claiming}} 13 wickets between them. A draw followed in Lord's, but England won the final match in a dramatic fashion. The West Indies in a seemingly <b>strong</b> <b>position</b> of 219/3 required 84 runs for victory. They suffered a late innings collapse however as Butcher, Sobers and Lloyd fell within 16 minutes, which ultimately led to England winning by 30 runs to win the series 2–0. It seemed that England would begin to dominate the West Indies, {{with many of the}} key West Indian players such as Butcher, Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith retiring in 1969. Illingworth would be the last England captain to win the Wisden Trophy for 31 years.|$|E
5|$|Even {{with the}} Republican victory in November 1866, Johnson {{considered}} {{himself in a}} <b>strong</b> <b>position.</b> The Fourteenth Amendment had been ratified by none of the Southern or border states except Tennessee, and had been rejected in Kentucky, Delaware, and Maryland. As the amendment required ratification by three-quarters of the states {{to become part of}} the Constitution, he believed the deadlock would be broken in his favor, leading to his election in 1868. Once it reconvened in December 1866, an energized Congress began passing legislation, often over a presidential veto; this included the District of Columbia voting bill. Congress admitted Nebraska to the Union over a veto, and the Republicans gained two senators and a state that promptly ratified the amendment. Johnson's veto of a bill for statehood for Colorado Territory was sustained; enough senators agreed that a district with a population of 30,000 was not yet worthy of statehood to win the day.|$|E
5|$|General William Howe {{had taken}} his army from New York City by sea on a {{campaign}} to capture Philadelphia instead of moving north to meet Burgoyne. Most of Burgoyne's Indian support had fled following the loss at Bennington, and his situation was becoming difficult. He needed to reach defensible winter quarters, requiring either retreat back to Ticonderoga or advance to Albany, {{and he decided to}} advance. He then deliberately cut communications to the north so that he would not need to maintain a chain of heavily fortified outposts between his position and Ticonderoga, and he decided to cross the Hudson River while he was in a relatively <b>strong</b> <b>position.</b> He ordered Baron Riedesel, who commanded the rear of the army, to abandon outposts from Skenesboro south, and then had the army cross the Hudson just north of Saratoga between September 13 and 15.|$|E

5|$|Having {{resolved}} {{the issue of}} his playing future, Miller was back in a good frame of mind for the Fourth Test in Adelaide. In a high-scoring match, Miller took a wicket in each innings, but he shone with the bat. England batted first and had reached a <b>strong</b> <b>position</b> of 4/320 {{on the second day}} when Miller bowled Joe Hardstaff junior, who edged a bouncer into his stumps for 67, ending a partnership of 118 with centurion Compton; the hosts lost wickets steadily thereafter to be dismissed for 460, and Miller ended with 1/45 from 16 overs in extreme heat. After Morris and Hassett put on 179 runs for the third wicket, Miller came in at 3/207 late on the third day and reached 33 by the time stumps were drawn with Australia at 4/293, while his partner Johnson was unbeaten on 35.|$|E
5|$|In the end, Emir Habibullah {{returned}} to his vacillating inactivity. He was aware the mission had found support within his council and had excited his volatile subjects. Four days after the draft treaty was signed, Habibullah called for a durbar, a grand meeting where a jihad {{was expected to be}} called. Instead, Habibullah reaffirmed his neutrality, explaining that the war's outcome was still unpredictable and that he stood for national unity. Throughout the spring of 1916, he continuously deflected the mission's overtures and gradually increased the stakes, demanding that India rise in revolution before he began his campaign. It was clear to Habibullah that for the treaty to hold any value, it required the Kaiser's signature, and that for Germany to even attempt to honour the treaty, she would have to be in a <b>strong</b> <b>position</b> in the war. It was a good insurance policy for Habibullah.|$|E
5|$|It was {{announced}} at the shareholders' annual meeting in September 1948 that York had purchased Bootham Crescent for £4,075, with the club's finances in a <b>strong</b> <b>position</b> at the time. Bigger crowds were recorded {{around the country in}} the post-war period, and York achieved five-figure average attendances in 1948–49 and 1955–56. Over the late 1940s and early 1950s, concreting was completed on the terracing in the Popular Stand, due to the efforts of the supporters' club, and the Shipton Street End. York reached the semi-final of the 1954–55 FA Cup, and two matches from this run were played at Bootham Crescent: the first-round match against Scarborough, which York won 3–2, and the fifth-round match against Tottenham Hotspur, which was won 3–1 before a crowd of 21,000. During the summer of 1955, the Main Stand was extended towards Shipton Street, funded by profits gained from the FA Cup run and a stand extension fund.|$|E
