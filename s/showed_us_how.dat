Boyz II Men were the first ones to put Destiny's Child on tour. They <b>showed</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> to treat an opening act and I will never forget that. That was 15 years ago! Wow, 15 years!

500|$|The {{nationalist}} incursions became {{fewer and}} further between {{after the two}} guerrilla armies suffered repeated setbacks against the security forces during the late 1960s, with many attacks being countered by the RLI. The capture by the RLI of Phinias Majuru, the ZIPRA Director of Operations, in January 1970 caused a cessation for six years of major operations by ZIPRA, which had been the more active guerrilla army up to that point. The Rhodesian Light Infantry's performance during this early period of the Bush War is generally considered to have been of a very high standard, with historian Alexandre Binda pointing to Operation Cauldron (1968) in particular as having contributed to the Battalion's formidable [...] "fighting character" [...] and reputation as [...] "outstanding and peerless anti-terrorist fighters". This opinion was shared by Platoon Warrant Officer Herod of the Rhodesian African Rifles, who was wounded during this operation while fighting alongside the RLI on 18 March 1968. [...] "We of the RAR used to laugh at your soldiers," [...] he said in hospital to a visiting RLI officer; [...] "To us they looked like boys. But they <b>showed</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> to fight. They have the faces of boys, but they fight like lions." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{series of}} {{contacts}} {{over the following}} days resulted in the guerrilla squads being split up and severely weakened, with the men who did not surrender or desert being killed or arrested; on 21 March, the insurgent commanders in Lusaka realised that their men had been detected and ordered the only remaining intact team, made up of 26 men, to return to Zambia. An assault on an enemy camp near Sipolilo on 26 March by 21 men from RLI Training Troop resulted {{in the deaths of}} two Troopers, R. A. Binks and G. D. Wessels. By 27 March, 28 cadres had been killed and 15 captured; by 3 April, the figures stood at 36 dead and 24 in custody. Five more were arrested on 4 April and one shot dead by men from 1 Troop, 1 Commando, south of Makuti. [...] "It now appeared obvious," [...] says Binda, [...] "that the insurgents had scattered and were on the run." [...] On 9 April, the last contact with any significant number of guerrillas involved took place north of Karoi. A police unit and 4 Troop, 1 Commando encountered a group of insurgents and killed all seven, but lost Trooper M. E. Thornley to a fatal chest wound. When Operation Cauldron was closed on 31 May 1968, 58 of the 126 fighters who had crossed from Zambia had been confirmed killed and 51 were captured. Of the 17 outstanding, nine had returned to Zambia, leaving eight unaccounted for. Having acquitted themselves well during the operation, the young RLI troopers, many still teenagers, earned high praise from Platoon Warrant Officer Herod of the RAR, who had been wounded fighting alongside them on the Maura on 18 March 1968. [...] "We of the RAR used to laugh at your soldiers," [...] Herod said to RLI Sergeant Tim Baker, who was visiting him in hospital. [...] "To us they looked like boys. But they <b>showed</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> to fight. They have the faces of boys, but they fight like lions." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{uncapped}} Cusack {{was named}} in Ireland's squad to face India and South Africa in June 2007; the squad was {{weakened by the}} absence of experienced players through commitments to their counties, injuries, and retirements after the 2007 Cricket World Cup. Not selected for the match against India, Cusack took Gary Wilson's place in the side for the match against South Africa on 24 June 2007. In the match, Cusack made his One Day International debut; the seventh bowler used by Trent Johnston, Cusack took three wickets out of Ireland's four in the match. His maiden wicket was that of Morne van Wyk and he also dismissed Jacques Kallis and Herschelle Gibbs. Chasing 174 to win from 31overs, Cusack top-scored for Ireland with 36not out (36*) as the team fell 42runs short of victory. Talking of Cusack's performance, Johnston said [...] "We knew he could make the step up... he came out there in tough conditions, against quality batsmen with short boundaries and he hit the top of off-stump and <b>showed</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> well he could bat...He's going to be in these Irish colours {{for a long time and}} he deserves that".|$|E

60|$|I {{set it down}} in all truth that, through God's mercy, {{our lives}} were saved by Master Hunt, for he counseled us wisely as to the care we should take of our bodies when our stomachs were crying out for food, and {{it was he who}} <b>showed</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> we might prepare this herb or the bark from that tree for the {{sustaining}} of life, when we had nothing else to put into our mouths.|$|E

30|$|In {{the first}} two articles, Loriliai Biernacki and Kusumita Pedersen present contemplative {{practice}} from within dharma traditions. From a Tantric perspective, Biernacki’s piece <b>shows</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> a nuanced understanding of the imagination {{can be used in}} contemplative practice to help us remedy the disintegrated, mechanistic world produced by the Cartesian mind-body split. Specifically, Biernacki differentiates the concepts of imagination expressed through bhāvana and vikalpa as found in the work of Abhinavagupta and Utpaladeva, <b>showing</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> bhāvana produces an integral experience of the mind and body in everyday life (vyavahāra), as opposed to the fragmented reality that vikalpa inevitably perpetuates.|$|R

They are finished; they have gone beyond to await us in the Under-world among the ghosts.

I do not know any particular reason, but I have always been glad. In the morning, the tenth day out, we crossed Green River, a fine, large, limpid stream--stuck in it with the water just {{up to the top of}} our mail-bed, and waited till extra teams were put on to haul us up the steep bank.

At his first coming, he bought and paid for us; at his second coming, he will fetch us to himself. At his first coming, he gave us promise of the kingdom; at his second coming, he will give us possession of the kingdom. At his first coming, he also <b>showed</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> we should be, by his own transfiguration; at his second coming, 'he will change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body' (Phil 3:21).|$|E
6000|$|Great as Stevenson {{was as a}} writer, he {{was still}} greater as a Man. So many admirable books {{have been written by}} men whose {{character}} will not bear examination, that it is refreshing to find one Master-Artist whose daily life was so full of the fruits of the spirit. As his romances have brought pleasure to thousands of readers, so the spectacle of his cheerful march through the Valley of the Shadow of Death is a constant source of comfort and inspiration. One feels ashamed of cowardice and petty irritation after witnessing the steady courage of this man. His philosophy of life is totally different from that of Stoicism; for the Stoic says, [...] "Grin and bear it," [...] and usually succeeds in doing neither. Stevenson seems to say, [...] "Laugh and forget it," [...] and he <b>showed</b> <b>us</b> <b>how</b> to do both.|$|E
