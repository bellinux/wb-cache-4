500|$|In 1969, after scoring hits {{as a solo}} artist such as [...] "By the Time I Get to Phoenix" [...] and [...] "Wichita Lineman", Glen Campbell {{left the}} Wrecking Crew. [...] Carol Kaye, {{exhausted}} from the constant pressure of the L.A. recording scene, went on to other musical endeavors. [...] According to guitarist Bill Pitman, [...] "You leave the house at seven o'clock in the morning, and you're at Universal at nine till noon; now you're at Capitol Records at one, you just got time to get there, then you got a jingle at four, then we're {{on a date with}} <b>somebody</b> <b>at</b> eight, then the Beach Boys at midnight, and you do that five days a week... jeez, man, you get burned out".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{contains}} multiple {{references to}} Star Wars, the film series in which Hamill starred. Throughout the episode, Hamill wears the costume of his Star Wars character Luke Skywalker, and tells Homer to [...] "use the forks," [...] spoofing the line [...] "use the Force" [...] from the series. The convention features a tag-team wrestling match which sees [...] "the mighty robots" [...] (the Cylons) from the series Battlestar Galactica fight the [...] "gay robots" [...] (R2-D2 and C-3PO) from Star Wars. <b>Somebody</b> <b>at</b> the convention wears a costume of the Star Wars character Chewbacca. Homer and Mayor Quimby attend {{a production of}} the musical Guys and Dolls (1955), starring Hamill as Nathan Detroit, who sings the Star Wars-themed [...] "Luke, Be a Jedi Tonight" [...] {{to the tune of}} [...] "Luck Be a Lady".|$|E
500|$|The Manchester Evening News later {{described}} the [...] "Say Say Say" [...] video as an [...] "anarchic caper" [...] that [...] "plays out like an Emir Kusturica feature". PopMatters {{stated that the}} music videos of [...] "Say Say Say" [...] and [...] "Goodnight Tonight" [...] turned [...] "a pair of otherwise forgettable songs into something worth watching". Steven Greenlee of The Boston Globe reflected that the video was both [...] "horrifying and compelling", and stated the ridiculousness of a potion which could aid Jackson in beating <b>somebody</b> <b>at</b> arm wrestling. He added, [...] "It's even harder {{to believe that the}} two of them didn't get the pulp beaten out of them in that bar for dressing like a pair of Chess King employees". The [...] "Say Say Say" [...] video was later included on the DVDs The McCartney Years and Michael Jackson's Vision.|$|E

500|$|Luke Brookshier, Marc Ceccarelli, Derek Iversen, and Mr. Lawrence {{served as}} the episode's writers, with Brookshier and Ceccarelli serving as {{storyboard}} directors. [...] "It's a SpongeBob Christmas!" [...] {{was based on the}} 2009 Christmas song [...] "Don't Be a Jerk (It's Christmas)" [...] written by SpongeBob's voice actor Tom Kenny and his writing partner Andy Paley. They wrote it as [...] "...just sort of a little sample calling card of what we were thinking about." [...] The story of the song was conceived with the help of one of the episode's writers Mr. Lawrence. Kenny explained, [...] "...Eventually <b>somebody</b> <b>at</b> Nickelodeon found it [...] on their desk and decided to make it into a holiday special." [...] The network let Kenny and Paley write three more songs for the upcoming special episode (Nickelodeon eventually decided to release a soundtrack album, which became It's a SpongeBob Christmas! Album, containing the songs to coincide with the episode).|$|E
500|$|Ridley Scott {{worked very}} closely with {{composer}} Hans Zimmer, during post-production on Hannibal. Scott believes the music to a film {{is as important as}} dialogue—"It is the final adjustment to the screenplay, being able to also adjust the performance of the actors in fact." [...] Zimmer and Scott sat in during the editing process with editor Pietro Scalia to discuss scenes in the film and [...] "not music". Zimmer used a symphony orchestra for the opera sequence, but would mostly use what he described as a [...] "very odd orchestra...only cellos and basses all playing at the extreme ends of their range." [...] This was done to emphasise the character of Hannibal Lecter. He explains: [...] "Anthony's character is for me <b>somebody</b> <b>at</b> the extreme range of whatever is humanly imaginable somehow." [...] Zimmer also did not want the score to sound like a [...] "modern day orchestra". The character Mason Verger had his own [...] "theme", which become more [...] "perverted" [...] as the film progressed, according to Zimmer. Dante's sonnet was put to music by Zimmer and Patrick Cassidy for the opera scene in Florence. Tracksounds.com wrote positively of Zimmer's score. [...] "Zimmer truly crafts a score worthy of most fans' full attention...the classical elements, and yes, even the monologue combine to make this an intense listening experience." [...] In a poll by British Classic FM listeners to find the greatest film soundtrack of all time, Hannibal ranked at [...] 59. Strauss's The Blue Danube is also played at several points in the film.|$|E
2500|$|The BBC assesses {{that many}} members of the Afghan public are vocal in support of Abdul Rahman's execution, though it does not {{estimate}} if these are in the majority. [...] "The courts should punish him and he should be put to death," [...] said Kabul dweller Abdul Zahid Paymen. Mohammed Qadir agrees that he must be executed: [...] "According to Islamic law he should be sentenced to death because Christianity is forbidden in our land". Abdul Rahman's neighbor remarked: [...] "there is no way we are going to allow an Afghan to insult us by becoming Christian." [...] Religious intellectual Shahnawaz Farooqui, speaking on Abdul Rahman's conversion, said [...] "he will have to be executed… If <b>somebody</b> <b>at</b> one point affirms the truth and then rejects it or denies it, it would jeopardize the whole paradigm of truth. This is such a big offense that the penalty can only be death. At the very most, some scholars argue that the person should be given time to rethink, and if he embraces Islam again, he will be forgiven." ...|$|E

2500|$|Scrooge {{was shown}} in The Magic Hourglass in a more {{positive}} light than in previous stories, but his more villainous side is present too. Scrooge is seen in this story attempting to reacquire a magic hourglass that he gave to Donald, before finding out that it acted as a protective charm for him. Scrooge starts losing one billion dollars each minute, and comments that he will go bankrupt within 600 years. This line is a parody of Orson Welles's line in Citizen Kane [...] "You know, Mr.Thatcher, {{at the rate of}} a million dollars a year, I'll have to close this place in... 60 years". To convince his nephews to return it, he pursues them throughout Morocco, where they had headed to earlier in the story. Memorably during the story, Scrooge interrogates Donald by having him tied up and tickled with a feather in an attempt to get Donald to reveal the hourglass's location. Scrooge finally manages to retrieve it, exchanging it for a flask of water, as he had found his nephews exhausted and left in the desert with no supplies. As Scrooge explains, he intended to give them a higher offer, but he just could not resist having <b>somebody</b> <b>at</b> his mercy without taking advantage of it.|$|E
