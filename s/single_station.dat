5|$|At {{the time}} of the 1966 smog, air quality {{measurements}} were recorded from only a <b>single</b> <b>station,</b> the Harlem Courthouse building on East 121st Street, run by Braverman and his staff of 15. Taking measurements from a <b>single</b> <b>station</b> meant that the index reflected conditions in that small area, but served as a poor, unrepresentative gauge of overall air quality across the entire city. The Interstate Sanitation Commission, a regional agency run by New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut and headquartered at Columbus Circle, also relied on the Harlem Courthouse laboratory. Formed in 1936, the advisory agency was authorized in 1962 by New York and New Jersey to oversee air pollution issues.|$|E
5|$|Each {{subsequent}} {{line was}} built by a different company. Rivalry often prevented any cooperation over shared facilities, and so almost every railway line into Preston used its own station. It was not until 1900 that all lines in Preston shared a <b>single</b> <b>station,</b> by which time all the companies had {{been taken over by}} one or both of just two companies.|$|E

5|$|The {{station is}} one of two {{separate}} Underground stations of the same name. The other station, on Praed Street to the south of the mainline station, is served by the Bakerloo, Circle and District lines. Although shown on the London Underground map as a <b>single</b> <b>station,</b> the two stations are not directly linked and interchange between them is via the concourse of the mainline station.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the history}} of the various railways, Paddington is served by four London Underground lines through two {{separate}} stations: the Bakerloo, Circle and District lines have a combined sub-surface and deep-level station on Praed Street to the south of the main line station, and the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines have a sub-surface station with access from Paddington Basin to the north. Circle line services run through both of the sub-surface stations as part of a spiral route. Although shown on the London Underground map as a <b>single</b> <b>station,</b> the two stations are not directly linked.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} in two parts: sub-surface platforms, opened in 1868 and deep-level platforms, opened in 1913. It {{is one of}} two {{separate}} Underground stations of the same name. The other station, {{to the north of the}} mainline station, is served by the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines. Although shown on the London Underground map as a <b>single</b> <b>station,</b> the two stations are not directly linked and interchange between them is via the concourse of the mainline station.|$|E
30|$|Motivated by {{the needs}} of the {{high-voltage}} power transmission industry, we use data from the high-latitude IMAGE magnetometer array to study characteristics of extreme geoelectric fields at regional scales. We use 10 -s resolution data for years 1993 – 2013, and the fields are characterized using average horizontal geoelectric field amplitudes taken over station groups that span about 500 -km distance. We show that geoelectric field structures associated with localized extremes at <b>single</b> <b>stations</b> can be greatly different from structures associated with regionally uniform geoelectric fields, which are well represented by spatial averages over <b>single</b> <b>stations.</b> Visual extrapolation and rigorous extreme value analysis of spatially averaged fields indicate that the expected range for 1 -in- 100 -year extreme events are 3 – 8 V/km and 3.4 – 7.1 V/km, respectively. The Quebec reference ground model is used in the calculations.|$|R

50|$|When private- or professional-mobile-radio (PMR) {{first started}} the systems simply {{consisted}} of a <b>single</b> base <b>station</b> {{with a number of}} mobiles that could communicate with this <b>single</b> base <b>station.</b> These systems are still in widespread use today with taxi firms and many others using them for communication. Now facilities such as DTMF and CTCSS provide additional calling selection.|$|R
5|$|Also during 1956, the Fantasyland Depot, a new {{station with}} a Medieval theme and {{consisting}} of a covered platform with no station building, was created for the DRR in the Fantasyland section. By the time this new station was added, the DRR's system of having one train assigned to a <b>single</b> <b>station</b> and using sidings to pass trains stopped at stations was abandoned and replaced by the current system where each train stops at every station along the railroad's route. Fantasyland Depot was removed by July 1966 when the It's a Small World attraction, originally built for the 1964 New York World's Fair, was installed.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{reduction}} in traffic caused by Cromer's decline in popularity as a holiday destination after World War II, and the closure of many Norfolk railway lines in the 1950s, {{a decision was made}} to concentrate all passenger traffic into a <b>single</b> <b>station.</b> Although Cromer High had far better facilities, it was inconveniently situated {{on the edge of the}} town. Therefore, all passenger services were diverted into Cromer Beach (renamed Cromer) and the other stations closed. Following growth of the town as a commuter town to Norwich, a new station called Roughton Road opened in 1985, near the site of the former Cromer High.|$|E
5|$|Griffith {{remained}} a one-station market, however {{instead of taking}} programming from Prime {{in line with the}} network's other stations, MTN-9 relayed programming mainly from WIN Television in southern New South Wales. A supplementary licence, AMN-31, was successfully bid for by MTN in 1996, providing a relay of Prime Television. Soon after the station was purchased by WIN Television, which undertook a number of minor changes – mainly changing the news service to WIN News, and using entirely WIN branding. AMN-31 remains a relay of Prime. Similarly, the Mildura licence area remained separate from the remainder of Victoria, albeit with a <b>single</b> <b>station,</b> STV-8, later bought out by WIN Television in 1996. In 1997 Prime was successful in bidding for a new licence for the area at a cost of $3.2 million. PTV-31 began broadcasting the following year.|$|E

5|$|The station {{consists}} of a central island platform between the tracks that are elevated on a railway embankment. There are four tracks through the site {{although there are no}} platforms for the c2c lines. The full length of the platform is covered by a <b>single</b> <b>station</b> canopy with a central waiting room. The Art Deco red brick ticket office is located below platform level to which it is connected by a subway and stairway. Although similar to the other single-storey station buildings on this part of the route, it is notable for its high atrium roof and polygonal shape. The floor is tiled with a reversed swastika pattern, a popular decorative design at the time the station was constructed. The station is listed as a building of local heritage interest by Havering London Borough Council.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{instances}} where two separate stations {{share the same}} name: there is one Edgware Road station on the Circle, District and Hammersmith & City lines and another Edgware Road on the Bakerloo line, and there is one Hammersmith station on the District and Piccadilly lines and another Hammersmith station on the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines. Although the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines station at Paddington {{is on the other}} side of the main line station to the Bakerloo, Circle and District lines station, it is shown as a <b>single</b> <b>station</b> on the current Tube map. It has been shown as two separate stations at different times in the past.|$|E
5|$|To be {{completed}} by 2030, the 1.6-kilometre extension will run from Punggol through Punggol North including the new Punggol Downtown. The extension is for future residents in Punggol North to have train access to the city centre {{as well as other}} parts of Singapore. On 7 June 2017, it was announced by Second Minister for Transport Ng Chee Meng that the North-East Line extension will open in 2023 instead, a few years ahead of the expected opening date. The <b>single</b> <b>station</b> extension will span 1.6km and will serve the future Punggol North area. The station is tentatively called Punggol Coast station.

5|$|Railroad-building expert Earl Vilmer {{created the}} track layout and {{operations}} for the DRR. Roger Broggie hired Vilmer because of his experience building railroads in Iran for the Allies during World War II, in France after the war, and later in Venezuela for U.S. Steel. Vilmer designed {{the operations of the}} DRR {{in such a way that}} each of its two trains would be assigned to a <b>single</b> <b>station</b> on the rail line, making only complete round trips possible. The Retlaw 1 passenger train pulled by the No. 2 locomotive only serviced Main Street, U.S.A. Station while the Retlaw 2 freight train pulled by the No. 1 locomotive only serviced Frontierland Station, and with sidings at both stations, each train would operate simultaneously and continue down the rail line even if the other train was stopped at its station. The first test run of the DRR's trains along the full length of its route occurred on July 10, 1955, one week before Disneyland's opening. The steam trains of the DRR were the first of Disneyland's attractions to become operational.|$|E
