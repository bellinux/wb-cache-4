5|$|With {{the decline}} in the empire's {{resources}} following losses in population and territory, domes in Byzantine architecture were used as part of more modest new buildings. The large-scale churches of Byzantium were, however, kept in good repair. The upper portion of the Church of Hagia Irene was thoroughly rebuilt after an earthquake in 740. The nave was re-covered with an elliptical domical vault hidden externally by a low cylinder on the roof, in place of the earlier barrel vaulted ceiling, and the original central dome from the Justinian era was replaced with one raised upon a high windowed drum. The barrel vaults supporting these two new domes were also extended out over the side aisles, creating cross-domed units. By bracing the dome with broad arches on all four sides, the cross-domed unit provided a more secure structural system. These units, with most domes raised on drums, became a <b>standard</b> <b>element</b> on a smaller scale in later Byzantine church architecture, and all domes built after the transitional period were braced with bilateral symmetry.|$|E

As the road was extended north during the 1930s, {{it became clear that the}} wider medians improved safety without sacrificing beauty, and starting with the NY52 exit in East Fishkill it was made a <b>standard</b> <b>element</b> of the parkway's design.|$|E

However, diesel engine and gas turbine driven alternators are the primary power source for most modern electrically propelled ships. She also had a bulbous bow, two sets of stabilizers, and two funnels side-by-side. The lifeboats, which were made from glass fibre, were placed three decks lower than usual for ships of her type, and were recessed into the hull to allow improved view from the passenger decks.|$|E

The introduction of <b>standard</b> <b>elements</b> adapted to geometries far from parallelepipeds and freely designed raises a specific problem.

500|$|Oryzomyini, {{also known}} as rice rats, is a diverse {{grouping}} of North, Central, and South American rodents within the family Cricetidae. Remains of extinct rice rats are known throughout the Lesser Antilles, but the systematic relationships among those animals are poorly understood, and many species remain unnamed. Rice rat fossils were first recorded from Saint Kitts in 1907 by archeologist C.W. Branch and were later found in abundance in Amerindian archeological sites on nearby Nevis and Sint Eustatius. The rice rat of these islands was formally described and named as Pennatomys nivalis in a 2010 article by zoologist Samuel Turvey and coworkers. The generic name, Pennatomys, combines the Latin pennatus [...] "winged" [...] with -mys [...] "mouse", a <b>standard</b> <b>element</b> {{in the names of}} rodent genera, and honors archeologist Elizabeth Wing. The specific name, nivalis, is Latin for [...] "snowy" [...] and refers to Nevis. This island's name derives from the Spanish Nuestra Señora de las Nieves [...] "Our Lady of the Snows", a reference to the clouds (mistaken for snow) that surround the island's central peak.|$|E
500|$|Sree Padma and Anthony Barber {{note that}} merit {{transfer}} was well-established {{and a very}} integral part of Buddhist practice in the Andhra region of southern India. In addition, inscriptions at numerous sites across South Asia provide definitive evidence that the transfer of merit was widely practiced {{in the first few}} centuries CE. In Theravāda Buddhism, it has become customary for donors to share merits during ceremonies held at intervals, and during a teaching. In Mahāyāna Buddhism, it is believed that Bodhisattvas in the heavens are capable of transferring merits, and will do so to help relief the suffering of their devotees, who then can dedicate it to others. This concept has led to several Buddhist traditions focused on devotion. Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna Buddhists transfer merits as part of the 'Seven-part-worship' (...) , and there is almost no ceremony without some form of merit transfer. Thus, merit transfer has developed to become a <b>standard</b> <b>element</b> in the basic liturgy of all main schools of Buddhism. Indeed, the transfer of merits has grown that important in Buddhism, that it has become a major way for Buddhism to sustain itself. In Japan, some temples are even called ekōdera, which means a temple for merit transfer.|$|E

[...] This litany is subsequently referred to variously as the Śatarudriyam, the Namakam (because many of the verses commence with the word namaḥ [...] ), or simply the Rudram.

"Cross-domed units", a {{more secure}} {{structural}} system created by bracing a dome on all four sides with broad arches, became a <b>standard</b> <b>element</b> {{on a smaller scale}} in later Byzantine church architecture. The Cross-in-square plan, with a single dome at the crossing or five domes in a quincunx pattern, became widely popular in the Middle Byzantine period (c. 843–1204). It is the most common church plan from the tenth century until the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Resting domes on circular or polygonal drums pierced with windows eventually became the standard style, with regional characteristics.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is divided}} into two main sections. The first section is based on information about the 950 responsories in the 12 th-century antiphoner from Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, now held in the national library in Paris with the shelf mark fonds latin 12044. These responsories were transcribed and divided into component melodic parts or �elements�. Elements which occur five times or more in the modal repertory were considered 'standard' and given a label based on their goal-pitches, positions, and the frequency with which they appear in the repertory. According to these criteria, {{more than half of the}} musical material used in the responsory repertory is 'standard'. Analysis shows a consistent melodic structure across the responsory repertory, characterized by <b>standard</b> <b>elements</b> positioned in particular places, leading to preconceived tonal goals. Observations about the goal-pitches of both <b>standard</b> and non-standard <b>elements</b> form the basis for modally specific responsory 'roadmaps'. The second section of this dissertation is based on a comparison of 406 responds common to Paris, fonds latin 12044 and eight other Gregorian sources: a collection of antiphoners from Sarum (compiled by W. H. Frere), Worcester F 160, Lucca 601, Benevento 21, St. Gall 390 - 391, Karlsruhe 60, Utrecht 406 and Toledo 44. 2. This comparison reveals different types of variants in the repertory: 'house style' modifications of particular musical gestures, textual variants, variant elements at one or several places in the melody, a melody varied throughout the melody, and the use of a completely different melody. Each type of difference was examined in order to determine its impact on <b>standard</b> and non-standard <b>element</b> usage. Results show that the use of <b>standard</b> <b>elements</b> has tonal / structural implications. The more <b>standard</b> <b>elements</b> one responsory includes, the more likely it is to match the tonal outline of the majority of responds in its mode. Non-standard elements tend to be found in greater numbers in comparatively late responds, and their use is usually coupled with tonal deviation from the 'roadmap'. Non-standard elements are also the most unstable, and are most likely to vary melodically from one source to another. The use of <b>standard</b> <b>elements</b> in organized ways within a melodic structure is best understood in terms of oral composition and transmission. This study examines how <b>standard</b> <b>elements</b> function in respond composition, how that function is maintained in different Gregorian sources, and what this reveals about the oral origins of the repertory...|$|R
