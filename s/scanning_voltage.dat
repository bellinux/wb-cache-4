50|$|<b>Scanning</b> <b>voltage</b> {{microscopy}} (SVM), sometimes {{also called}} nanopotentiometry, is a scientific experimental technique based on atomic force microscopy. A conductive probe, usually {{only a few}} nanometers wide at the tip, is placed in full contact with an operational electronic or optoelectronic sample. By connecting the probe to a high-impedance voltmeter and rastering over the sample's surface, {{a map of the}} electric potential can be acquired. SVM is generally nondestructive to the sample although some damage may occur to the sample or the probe if the pressure required to maintain good electrical contact is too high. If the input impedance of the voltmeter is sufficiently large, the SVM probe should not perturb the operation of the operational sample.|$|E

We present Scanning Mobility CCN Analysis (SMCA) as a novel {{method for}} obtaining rapid {{measurements}} of size-resolved cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) distributions and activation kinetics. SMCA involves sampling the monodisperse outlet stream of a Differential Mobility Analyzer (DMA) operated in <b>scanning</b> <b>voltage</b> mode concurrently with CCN and condensation particle counters. By applying the same inversion algorithm as used for obtaining size distributions with a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS), CCN concentration and activated droplet size are obtained {{as a function}} of mobility size over the timescale of an SMPS scan (typically 60 - 120 s). Methods to account for multiple charging, non-sphericity effects and limited counting statistics are presented.

30|$|The {{excitation}} {{process takes}} place in an electric-field-free region that is provided {{by a number of}} electrically connected metal rings. The distance between two adjacent metal rings is 10 mm and the symmetry axis of the rings is coincident with the electron beam direction. The rings are set to a variable voltage to change the electron impact energy. The electric-field-free region between the two central rings is accessible to the electron beam and the target jet. Rings blocking the flight path of the scattered target atoms are cut on the lower end to clear the path to the detector. The electron gun, interaction region boundary rings and the magnetic field are aligned precisely to keep the projectile beam on the axis of the apparatus when the interaction potential is changed. Any change in overlap of the electron beam and the jet leads to changing count rates. In the aligned setup, this effect was negligible for scanning amplitudes up to 2 V.

The analytical technique called <b>voltage</b> <b>scanning</b> coulometry is very similar to controlled potential coulometry. The main difference is that in <b>voltage</b> <b>scanning</b> coulometry the potential of the working electrode is <b>scanned</b> through a <b>voltage</b> range rather than remaining at a constant potential. The equations for <b>voltage</b> <b>scanning</b> coulometry were verified for the ferric-ferrous couple and silver deposition on a gold electrode.

40|$|The {{external}} {{performance of}} quantum optoelectronic devices {{is governed by}} the spatial profiles of electrons and potentials within the active regions of these devices. For example, in quantum cascade lasers (QCLs), the electric field domain (EFD) hypothesis posits that the potential distribution might be simultaneously spatially nonuniform and temporally unstable. Unfortunately, there exists no prior means of probing the inner potential profile directly. Here we report the nanoscale measured electric potential distribution inside operating QCLs by using <b>scanning</b> <b>voltage</b> microscopy at a cryogenic temperature. We prove that, per the EFD hypothesis, the multi-quantum-well active region is indeed divided into multiple sections having distinctly different electric fields. The electric field across these serially-stacked quantum cascade modules does not continuously increase in proportion to gradual increases in the applied device bias, but rather hops between discrete values {{that are related to}} tunneling resonances. We also report the evolution of EFDs, finding that an incremental change in device bias leads to a hopping-style shift in the EFD boundary – the higher electric field domain expands at least one module each step {{at the expense of the}} lower field domain within the active region.

40|$|Transient or {{hysteresis}} {{effects in}} polycrystalline thin film CdS/CdTe cells are {{a function of}} pre-measurement voltage bias and whether Cu is introduced as an intentional dopant during back contact fabrication. When Cu is added, the current-density (J) vs. voltage (V) measurements performed in a reverse-to-forward voltage direction will yield higher open-circuit voltage (Voc), up to 10 mV, and smaller short-circuit current density (Jsc), by up to 2 mA/cm 2, relative to <b>scanning</b> <b>voltage</b> in a forward-to-reverse direction. The variation at the maximum power point, Pmax, is however small. The resulting variation in FF can be as large as 3 %. When Cu is not added, hysteresis in both Voc and Jsc is negligible however Pmax hysteresis is considerably greater. This behavior corroborates observed changes in depletion width, Wd, derived from capacitance (C) vs voltage (V) scans. Measured values of Wd are always smaller in reverse-to-forward voltage scans, and conversely, larger in the forward-to-reverse voltage direction. Transient ion drift (TID) measurements performed on Cu-containing cells do not show ionic behavior suggesting that capacitance transients are more likely due to electronic capture-emission processes. J-V curve simulation using Pspice shows that increased transient capacitance during light-soak stress at 100 degrees C correlates with increased space-charge recombination. Voltage-dependent collection however was not observed to increase with stress in these cells...|$|E
40|$|Direct-reading {{instruments}} {{have been}} widely used for characterizing airborne nanoparticles in inhalation toxicology and industrial hygiene studies for exposure/risk assessments. Instruments using electrical mobility sizing followed by optical counting, e. g., scanning or sequential mobility particle spectrometers (SMPS), have been considered as the "gold standard" for characterizing nanoparticles. An SMPS has the advantage of rapid response and has been widely used, but there is little information on its performance in assessing the full spectrum of nanoparticles encountered in the workplace. In this study, an SMPS was evaluated for its effectiveness in producing "monodisperse" aerosol and its adequacy in characterizing overall particle size distribution using three test aerosols, each mimicking a unique class of real-life nanoparticles: singlets of nearly spherical titanium dioxide (TiO 2), agglomerates of fiber-like multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT), and aggregates that constitutes welding fume (WF). These aerosols were analyzed by SMPS, cascade impactor, and by counting and sizing of discrete particles by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The effectiveness of the SMPS to produce classified particles (fixed voltage mode) was assessed by examination of the resulting geometric standard deviation (GSD) from the impactor measurement. Results indicated that SMPS performed reasonably well for TiO 2 (GSD = 1. 3), but not for MWCNT and WF as evidenced by the large GSD values of 1. 8 and 1. 5, respectively. For overall characterization, results from SMPS (<b>scanning</b> <b>voltage</b> mode) exhibited particle-dependent discrepancies in the size distribution and total number concentration compared to those from microscopic analysis. Further investigation showed that use of a single-stage impactor at the SMPS inlet could distort the size distribution and underestimate the concentration as shown by the SMPS, whereas the presence of vapor molecules or atom clusters in some test aerosols might cause artifacts by counting "phantom particles. " Overall, the information obtained from this study will help understand the limitations of the SMPS in measuring nanoparticles so that one can adequately interpret the results for risk assessments and exposure prevention in an occupational or ambient environment.

40|$|The {{external}} {{performance of}} quantum optoelectronic devices {{is governed by}} the three-dimensional profiles of electric potentials determined by the distribution of charge carriers (electrons and holes) within the active regions of the devices. Charge carrier dynamics {{play a vital role}} in active photonic quantum/nano devices, such as electrically-pumped semiconductor lasers. As an example, in quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) the Electric Field Domain (EFD) hypothesis posits that the potential distribution might be simultaneously spatially non-uniform and temporally unstable. Until now, there are no experimental means of probing the inner potential profile directly and as a result the mechanisms responsible for sub-par device performance of QCLs remain the subject of speculation. Another example is interband cascade lasers (ICLs), in which the distribution of gain-providing charge carrier governs the operation and performance of the devices, but has not been experimentally measured prior to this study. 	This work presents a systematic experimental study of gain-providing charge carrier distribution in a lasing interband cascade laser and electric potential distribution in THz QCLs. The unique charge carrier distribution profile in the quantum-well active region is quantitatively measured at nanometer scales by using the non-invasive <b>scanning</b> <b>voltage</b> microscopy (SVM) technique. Experimental results clearly confirm the accumulation and spatial segregation of holes and electrons in the core of the ICL device. The measurement also shows that the charge carrier density is essentially clamped in the presence of stimulated emission in ICLs, thus conclusively differentiating the lasing from non-lasing devices. The SVM technique has been applied to lasing THz QCLs to verify the hypothesis of electric field domains in semiconductor quantum structures. The experimental results reveal that the multi-quantum-well active region is divided into multiple sections having distinctly different electric fields. The electric field across these serially-stacked quantum cascade modules are observed not to continuously increase in proportion to the gradual increase of the applied device bias, but rather jumps between discrete values related to tunneling resonances. Also in the THz QCLs the progression of the observed EFDs are carefully probed. Experimental evidences reveal that an incremental change in device bias leads to a hopping-style shift in the EFD boundary – the higher electric field domain expands at least one module each step at the expense of the lower field domain within the active region. The SVM findings in THz QCLs indicate the importance of quantum active region design for intrinsically more uniform and stable electric field profiles. 	The two showcase study examples demonstrate that the cryogenic-temperature SVM is an enabling technique, being able to measure and resolve nanometer scale features non-destructively on operating devices. This experimental approach allows directly mapping the electric field distribution as well as the charge carrier distribution inside operating semiconductor quantum devices at nanometer scales, thus connecting the inner workings with the external measures of the devices. The experimental approach is expected to facilitate a deeper understanding of fundamental processes that are governing the operation and performance of a wide range of nanoelectronic and nanophotonic devices. 4 month...|$|E
40|$|The {{higher order}} fields {{present in the}} {{quadrupole}} ion trap may have beneficial effects such as increases in mass resolution in the mass-selective instability or resonance ejection modes of operation, but may also result in losses of ions due to nonlinear resonances. In this work, the reduction in ion intensities observed in the mass spectra of polyethylene glycol (PEG 1000) has been utilized to monitor the ion losses resulting from these higher order fields during the rf <b>voltage</b> <b>scans</b> in both the forward and reverse directions. Extensive ion losses were observed in reverse rf <b>voltage</b> <b>scans</b> at qz = 0. 64 (az = 0), which corresponds to octopole resonance at βz = 1 / 2.

40|$|The dynamic {{response}} of a non-volatile, bistable resistive memory fabricated {{in the form}} of Al 2 O 3 /polymer diodes has been probed in both the off- and on-state using triangular and step voltage profiles. The results provide insight into the wide spread in switching times reported in the literature and explain an apparently anomalous behaviour of the on-state, namely the disappearance of the negative differential resistance region at high <b>voltage</b> <b>scan</b> rates which is commonly attributed to a "dead time" phenomenon. The off-state response follows closely the predictions based on a classical, two-layer capacitor description of the device. As <b>voltage</b> <b>scan</b> rates increase, the model predicts that the fraction of the applied voltage, V ox, appearing across the oxide decreases. Device responses to step voltages in both the off- and on-state show that switching events are characterized by a delay time. Coupling such delays to the lower values of Vox attained during fast scan rates, the anomalous observation in the on-state that, device currents decrease with increasing <b>voltage</b> <b>scan</b> rate, is readily explained. Assuming that a critical current is required to turn off a conducting channel in the oxide, a tentative model is suggested to explain the shift in the onset of negative differential resistance to lower voltages as the <b>voltage</b> <b>scan</b> rate increases. The findings also suggest that the fundamental limitations on the speed of operation of a bilayer resistive memory are the time- and voltage-dependences of the switch-on mechanism and not the switch-off process. © 2013 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

We examined the IDDQ signatures of all SEMATECH experiment chips that were classified as good or bad by a combination of functional, delay and <b>scan</b> <b>voltage</b> tests. A single IDDQ threshold, whether absolute or differential, cannot separate good/bad chips reliably. Good chip signatures contain discrete levels (or bands) of varying widths and separations. A faulty chip almost always displays noise and glitches in the band structure. The graphical IDDQ classifier shows very high accuracy for SEMATECH test data with a test escape rate of 5. 97 %, compared with 7. 5 % for the single threshold method, 7. 6 % for current differences and 7. 5 % for the ΔIDDQ method. The graphical IDDQ method had a 1. 2 % test overkill, compared with 2. 3 % for the single threshold method, 6. 1 % for current differences and 7. 0 % for ΔIDDQ...|$|R
40|$|The {{electro-optic}} effect of GaAs {{is applied to}} profile the voltage distribution of the two-dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) in a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure. In our setup we reached a voltage sensitivity of 2 mV. We used this technique to characterize the local resistivity of the 2 DEG. The {{results are consistent with}} those obtained from <b>scanning</b> electron microscopy <b>voltage</b> contrast measurements...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} new DDQ testing signature, the {{graphical}} DDQ signature. We discovered that noise, {{in the entire}} set of current measurements for a chip, is a vastly superior feature for classifying chips as good or bad, compared to present methods. The measured DDQ current {{as a function of}} vectors is defined here as the signature. We examine the shape of the waveform defined by the total set of the DDQ measurements, to extract the number of bands that all of the current measurements cluster into, the width and separation of the bands and current glitches or noise among all DDQ measurements. We examined the DDQ signatures of all SEMATECH experiment chips that were classified as good or bad by a combination of functional, delay, and <b>scan</b> <b>voltage</b> tests. A single DDQ threshold, whether absolute or differential, cannot separate good/bad chips reliably. Good chip signatures contain discrete levels (or bands) of varying widths and separations. A faulty chip almost always displays noise and glitches in the band structure. The graphical DDQ classifier shows very high accuracy for SEMATECH test data with a test escape rate of 5. 97 %, compared with 7. 5 % for the single threshold method, 7. 6 % for current differences and 7. 5 % for the 1 DDQ method. The graphical DDQ method had a 1. 2 % test overkill, compared with 2. 3 % for the single threshold method, 6. 1 % for current differences and 7. 0 % for 1 DDQ.
