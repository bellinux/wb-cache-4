A 2 -dimensional braid over F is presented by an m-chart on pi(F). It is known that two surface links are equivalent if and only if their surface diagrams are related by a finite sequence of ambient isotopies of R 3 and local moves called Roseman moves.

This hub acts as a {{concentrator}} and collects data from various implantable and wearable body sensors via channel model 2 (CM 2) and channel model 3 (CM 3) links [3, 15]. CM 2 is a channel model characterizing an implant-to-body surface and implant-to-external links. CM 3 defines a body surface-to-body <b>surface</b> <b>link</b> for both line of sight (LOS) and non-line of sight (NLOS) links. The hub is connected to external gateway or fixed wireless access point placed in the wall through CM 4 channel at the distance d. For the sake of simplicity, let us assume the body rotates anti-clockwisely against the wireless access point (WAP). Thus, the CM 4 channel characteristics will vary according to the body direction toward the access point. Three adaptive schemes are applied to different channels experienced by the rotating transceiver of the hub on the body toward WAP.|$|E
40|$|Since {{the results}} from Semantic Web search engines are highly {{structured}} XML documents, they cannot be efficiently visualized with traditional explorers. Therefore, the Semantic Web calls {{for a new generation}} of search query visualizers that can rely on document metadata. This paper introduces such a visualization system called WebContent Visualizer that is used to display and browse search engine results. The visualization is organized into three levels: (1) Carousels contain documents with the same ranking, (2) carousels are piled into stacks, one for each date, and (3) these stacks are organized along a meta-carousel to display the results for several dates. Carousel stacks are piles of local carousels with increasing radii to visualize the ranks of classes. For document comparison, colored links connect documents between neighboring classes on the basis of shared entities. Based on these techniques, the interface is made of three collaborative components: an inspector window, a visualization panel, and a detailed dialog component. With this architecture, the system is intended to offer an efficient way to explore the results returned by Semantic Web search engines.
