30|$|Modeling one {{dimensional}} rapidly varying flow in open channels has drawn {{the attention of}} many researchers. Referred to as hydraulic jump, {{it serves as a}} transition region between supercritical and <b>sub-critical</b> <b>flows.</b> Numerical formulations used for solving the {{one dimensional}} unsteady flow equations are considered satisfactory if they can capture the jump location and the flow depths. While initial efforts for solving the flow equations used standard explicit and implicit finite difference (Fennema and Chaudhry 1986) and finite element (Katapodes and Strelkoff 1988) formulations, the reliability in using high resolution numerical schemes was first detailed in the work of Shu and Osher (1988). The primary advantage in using high resolution schemes lies in their ability to generate a numerical solution that is devoid of any oscillations, which is a characteristic feature of second and higher order accurate finite difference schemes. Most of the published works (Birman and Falcovitz 2007; Ying et al. 2004; Venutelli 2004) {{over the last few years}} have highlighted the application of a variant of high resolution schemes.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, uniform flow past a {{rotating}} cylinder at Re= 140, 000 is computed based on Large Eddy Simulation (LES). The cylinder rotates with different spin ratios varying from a= 0 to a= 2, where a {{is defined as}} the ratio of the cylinder's circumferential speed to the free-stream speed. The Smagorinsky model is applied to resolve the residual stresses. The present commercial code is validated based on available numerical and experimental data. The results agreed fairly well with these data for the cases of the flow over a stationary and over a rotating cylinder. As the spin ratio increases, the mean drag decreases and the mean cross-stream force acting to the cylinder increases. The vortices (time-averaged) downstream of the cylinder are displaced and deformed and the vortex that is close to the region of the fluid's acceleration shrinks and eventually collapses. By increasing a, the flow is also stabilized. It is observed that the vortex shedding process is suppressed. Specifically, the flow is unstable in load terms for spin ratios up to 1. 3. After this critical value, the flow is transitional for a few dimensionless time units demonstrating the well-known von-Karman vortex street and then it becomes stable with almost constant loads.

40|$|The goal of {{the present}} study is: (i) to {{demonstrate}} the two-dimensional nature of the elasto-inertial instability in elasto-inertial turbulence (EIT), (ii) to identify the role of the bi-dimensional instability in three-dimensional EIT flows and (iii) to establish the role of the small elastic scales in the mechanism of self-sustained EIT. Direct numerical simulations of FENE-P fluid flows are performed in two- and three-dimensional channels. The Reynolds number is set to Re_τ = 85 which is sub-critical for 2 D flows but beyond transition for 3 D ones. The polymer properties correspond to those of typical dilute polymer solutions and two moderate Weissenberg numbers, Wi_τ = 40, 100, are considered. The simulation results show that sustained turbulence can be observed in 2 D <b>sub-critical</b> <b>flows,</b> confirming the existence of a bi-dimensional elasto-inertial instability. The same type of instability is also observed in 3 D simulations where both Newtonian and elasto-inertial turbulent structures co-exist. Depending on the Wi number, one type of structure can dominate and drive the flow. For large Wi values, the elasto-inertial instability tends to prevail over the Newtonian turbulence. This statement is supported by (i) the absence of the typical Newtonian near-wall vortices and (ii) strong similarities between two- and three-dimensional flows when considering larger Wi numbers. The role of the small elastic scales is investigated by introducing global artificial diffusion in the hyperbolic transport equation for polymers. The study results show that the introduction of large polymer diffusion in the system strongly damps {{a significant part of the}} elastic scales that are necessary to feed turbulence, eventually leading to the flow laminarization.

30|$|Critical flow {{typically}} {{occurs when}} the pressure upstream of the wellhead is at least 70 % higher than the pressure downstream of the wellhead, or when the ratio of downstream pressure to upstream pressure is 0.588 or less. If the ratio of downstream pressure to upstream pressure is greater than 0.588, <b>sub-critical</b> <b>flow</b> conditions prevail (Beiranvand et al. 2012). When critical flow conditions prevail, the flow rate is primarily a function of upstream pressure, gas oil ratio (GOR), and the choke aperture diameter. In critical flow conditions pressure changes in the flow lines downstream of the wellhead do not affect the flow rate therein. Since the liquid production rate through wellhead chokes is affected by changes in their aperture diameter (i.e., choke size), modeling and simulating the rate of flow through chokes of various aperture diameters for specific oil/gas field conditions enables production engineers to better understand and control production flow conditions.|$|E

40|$|Vegetative {{buffer strips}} {{are widely used}} as a {{conservation}} measure to reduce erosion and transport of sediments and associated pollutants across landscapes. Buffers generally reduce sediment and pollutant loads {{through a combination of}} deposition and infiltration processes. The physical processes involved in sediment deposition by a stiff Vetiver grass buffer strip at low flow rates were examined in a series of experiments carried out in a 1 x 6 m flume of a rainfall simulator. Experiments were carried out using <b>sub-critical</b> <b>flows</b> on three different soils introduced to flow path as slurry upstream of the Vetiver strip at 1, 3 and 5 % slopes. Water and sediment profiles were measured at different time intervals while experiments were in progress. The strip caused a region of increased flow depth (backwater), upstream of the buffer which increased in depth and decreased in length with increasing slope. As slope increased, sediment was deposited closer to the grass strip, moving into the grass strip at 5 % slope. The buffer strip was less effective in reducing sediment transport as slope increased and differences between slopes were significant. These experiments quantified the reduction in sediment and particulate-sorbed nutrients from overland flow and data were used to test the newly developed model of GUSED-VBS (the Griffith University Soil Erosion & Deposition model-Vegetated Buffer Strip) for assessing and predicting buffer efficiency for sediment and sorbed nutrients. This model couples the hydraulics, sediment deposition and topography in order to predict water and sediment profiles upstream of a buffer strip with time. Unlike other models, GUSED-VBS simulates the evolution of the deposited layer by dynamically adjusting the bed elevation, the water profile and the flow velocity as a result of sediment accumulation. The model successfully predicts water and sediment profiles while masses of deposited sediment and sorbed nutrients (P, N) were generally simulated within 20 % of measured values. Further model development is in progress which will incorporate infiltration to provide a coupled overland/vadose approach to simulating flow through vegetative buffers.

40|$|International audienceObjectives: The {{objective}} of the present paper {{is to provide a}} challenging and well-defined validation test case for fluid-structure interaction (FSI) in turbulent flow to close a gap in the literature. The following list of requirements are taken into account during the definition and setup phase. First, the test case should be geometrically simple which is realized by a classical cylinder flow configuration extended by a flexible structure attached to the backside of the cylinder. Second, clearly defined operating and boundary conditions are a must and put into practice by a constant inflow velocity and channel walls. The latter are also evaluated against a periodic setup relying on a subset of the computational domain. Third, the material model should be widely used. Although a rubber plate is chosen as the flexible structure, it is demonstrated by additional structural tests that a classical St. Venant-Kirchhoff material model is sufficient to describe the material behavior appropriately. Fourth, the flow should be in the turbulent regime. Choosing water as the working fluid and a medium-size water channel, the resulting Reynolds number of Re = 30, 470 guarantees a <b>sub-critical</b> cylinder <b>flow</b> with transition taking place in the separated shear layers. Fifth, the test case results should be underpinned by a detailed validation process. Methods: For this purpose complementary numerical and experimental investigations were carried out. Based on optical contactless measuring techniques (particle-image velocimetry and laser distance sensor) the phase-averaged flow field and the structural deformations were determined. These data were compared with corresponding numerical predictions relying on large-eddy simulations and a recently developed semi-implicit predictor-corrector FSI coupling scheme.

40|$|Abstract – The {{implementation}} of boundary conditions in sub-critical and supercritical flow {{is quite different}} when using characteristics leading to programming difficulties with the associated numerical schemes. For supercritical flow, the de Saint Venant equations require two upstream boundary conditions and no downstream condition, whereas <b>sub-critical</b> <b>flow</b> requires one upstream and one downstream condition. The literature contains many approaches to accommodate both super- and sub-critical flows. Reducing or suppressing the convective term {{is one of the}} common methods which allows the same numerical scheme to be used for both regimes. In this paper, the impact of suppressing the convective term on the solution is investigated using the Method of Characteristics (MOC). A set of numerical experiments are carried out for this purpose using the commercial software MIKE 11, and the results are compared and contrasted with MOC. Results show that significant changes in computed water depths occur in some situations by suppressing the convective term. In conclusion, in some cases the solution algorithm is significantly affected by this approximation. Also, since recent advances in numerical modeling of trans-critical flow are superior, this approximation should gradually be removed from the numerical simulation of open channel flow...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{we examine}} realizations of no-normal flow {{boundary}} conditions on curved boundaries for discontinu-ous Galerkin (DG) solutions to channel problems governed by two-dimensional shallow water equations (SWE). Two approaches, {{both of which}} use a straight-sided-element mesh, are considered. The first approach, which is commonly used, consists simply of imposing the no-normal flow condition directly on the boundary of a straight-sided-element mesh. The second approach is a so-called curvature boundary condition which approximates a no-normal flow con-dition on the physical curved wall. Numerical solutions to <b>sub-critical</b> <b>flow</b> in a converging-diverging channel clearly indicate that, as in gas dynamics, a proper treatment of the no-normal flow condition on curved walls is crucial for an accurate DG solution to the SWE. In the test problem, errors introduced through the straightforward application of the no-normal flow condition on the linear approximation of curved walls result in artificial boundary layers in the velocity field and a corresponding over-prediction of the surface elevation in the upstream direction. These significant inaccuracies appear in flow problems without or with a lateral momentum diffusion term and in all DG schemes em-ployed including those using linear, quadratic, and cubic DG polynomials, and both the local Lax-Friedrichs and Roe numerical fluxes...|$|E
40|$|In many {{sporting}} activities {{the athletes}} and their associated equipment often {{operate in a}} range of Reynolds number, Re, that is close to the critical regime where the boundary layer flow undergoes transition from a laminar to a turbulent state. It is well known from numerous studies on circular cylinder and sphere flows that boundary layer transition can be forced to occur at lower Re, and hence drag reduced by delaying flow separation, through the application of, for example, roughness to the surface. This thesis is aimed at increasing understanding of how passive flow control methods might be employed to influence boundary layer flow {{in order to reduce the}} drag of bluff bodies. A wind tunnel based research programme was undertaken to study these aspects, including a review of a selection of commonly studied boundary layer tripping methods. The main body of the thesis is devoted to the investigation of two novel passive flow control concepts, developed for this research, which were found to significantly reduce the drag coefficient in the <b>sub-critical</b> Re <b>flow</b> regime of a plain cylinder. Of these two concepts, the main research focus was on identifying the drag reducing mechanisms of a system of passive, continuously blowing jets. It was found that the interaction of the jets and cross-flow induced a very high frequency instability which leads to the downstream formation of tornado-like vortices which are shed into, and identified in the near-wake. It is postulated that the introduction of stream-wise vorticity into the separating shear layer develops favourable drag reducing mechanisms. Discrete cylindrical surface protrusions were additionally found to develop similar effects on flow topology and drag reduction, and were more effective than the passive jets at low Reynolds numbers.

40|$|Super–sonic {{turbulence}} fragments molecular clouds (MC) into a {{very complex}} density field with density contrasts of several orders of magnitude. A fraction of the gas is locked into dense and gravitationally bound cores, which collapse as proto–stars. This process can be studied with numerical simulations of super–sonic self–gravitating turbulence. In this work, we use numerical simulations of magneto–hydrodynamic (MHD), super– sonic, super–Alfvénic and self–gravitating turbulence to compute the mass distribution of collapsing proto–stellar cores, which are selected as local density maxima. We find that the mass distribution of collapsing cores {{is consistent with the}} stellar initial mass function (IMF), suggesting that super–sonic turbulence may be responsible for the generation of the IMF. To support this conclusion we also show that the physical properties of the numerically selected cores are in agreement with the properties of observed NH 3 cores and that their magnetic field strength is consistent with Zeeman splitting measurements. In turbulent MCs, star formation occurs via the gravitational collapse of super– critical cores, formed by the turbulent <b>flow,</b> <b>sub–critical</b> cores being irrelevant for the process of star formation.

40|$|In this thesis, the {{phenomenon}} of flow-topography interaction is considered {{in the context of}} two dynamically distinct case studies. In the first study, tidally-driven upwelling is investigated usingfield data collected in Hydrographers Passage (20 ¡ÆS), a narrow, navigable channel in the dense outer reef matrix of the southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia. In the second study, island wake formations at Cato Island (155 ¡Æ 32 ¡¯E, 23 ¡Æ 15 ¡¯S) in the deep, Western Coral Sea are examined using a combination of field data and numerical experiments. The result of the Hydrographers Passage study are of considerable scientific interest since they apply to numerous smaller non-navigable reef-edge passages dotted throughout the southern Great Barrier Reef. Strong, semi-diurnal flood tides flowing through a gap in a distal patch reef system at the shelf break generate strong upwelling, providing a pulsed, semi-diurnal input of nutrients to the reefs offshore of the passage. If stable in the long term, this mechanism could have profound evolutionary implications for large reefal areas in the southern Great Barrier Reef. In the second study, two sets of field observations at Cato Island coincided with conditions of strong (~ 0. 7 m s- 1), vertically sheared incident currents and weaker (~ 0. 3 m s- 1), more variable incident flows. The combination of dynamically distinct flow regimes and a tall, steep-sided island penetrating oligotrophic surface waters provides a unique opportunity to investigate the impact of island wakes on hydrographic structure and biological enhancement. Field data indicate that flow disturbances downstream of Cato Island are likely to generate biological enhancement during conditions of eddy shedding and non-shedding wakes. A primitive equation numerical model configured on the basis of field observations faithfully reproduces the key features of both data sets; mechanisms responsible for producing these key features are proposed. Previous numerical studies of island wakes have concentrated primarily on eddy shedding flows. In this thesis, the <b>sub-critical</b> (non-shedding) <b>flow</b> scenario is also considered. It is demonstrated that particle retention in island wakes has a ¡®hair trigger¡¯ characteristic controlled by incident flow speed. This observation leads to a new proposal to explain the long-standing recruitment problem of biological oceanography...|$|R
