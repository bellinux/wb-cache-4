60|$|This jaw-bone is, I think, one of {{the most}} tormenting objects in the world to our human curiosity. To see it is like looking through a {{defective}} glass into the past and catching just one blurred and tantalizing glimpse of this Thing, shambling through the bleak wilderness, clambering to avoid the <b>sabre-toothed</b> <b>tiger,</b> watching the woolly rhinoceros in the woods. Then before we can scrutinize the monster, he vanishes. Yet the soil is littered abundantly with the indestructible implements he chipped out for his uses.|$|E
60|$|And with this, a new {{creation}} of enormous quadrupeds, as yet unknown. Countless herds of elephants pastured {{by the side}} of that mighty river, where now the Norfolk fisherman dredges their teeth and bones far out in open sea. The hippopotamus floundered in the Severn, the rhinoceros ranged over the south-western counties; enormous elk and oxen, of species now extinct, inhabited the vast fir and larch forests which stretched from Norfolk to the farthest part of Wales; hyenas and bears double the size of our modern ones, and here and there the <b>sabre-toothed</b> <b>tiger,</b> now extinct, prowled out of the caverns in the limestone hills, to seek their bulky prey.|$|E
6000|$|One of our savants {{has lately}} prophesied {{that the time}} will come when only the {{microscopic}} organisms will exist to satisfy the hunting instinct in man. How these small creatures will be taken he does not tell us.

When that time comes the amoeba--that [...] "wandering Jew," [...] as an irreverent Quarterly Reviewer has called it--will lose its immortality, and the spry rotifer will fall a victim to the infinitesimal fine bright arrows of the chase.

50|$|The {{focus of}} the park is its display of dinosaur models, each with an {{information}} board. In addition there are models of prehistoric fish, marine mammals and the odd turtles, hominids, mammoths and <b>sabre-toothed</b> <b>tigers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The plot of {{this chapter}} follows the mastodons, <b>sabre-toothed</b> <b>tigers</b> and woolly mammoths {{as they make}} their way into Alaska via the land bridge. First, the animals are {{discussed}} in general terms. Then, {{in the second half of}} the chapter, the reader learns about a specific mammoth named Mastodon, and another named Matriarch. The plot follows Matriarch and her family, as they encounter man for the first time.|$|R
50|$|The TARDIS {{arrives on}} Tiermann's World. Professor Tiermann {{and his family}} live alone here in a futuristic, fully {{automated}} Dreamhome, protected by a supposedly impenetrable force shield. An enormous alien creature called the Voracious Craw is heading towards their home {{with the intent to}} devour everything. But the Craw is not the only enemy - outside <b>sabre-toothed</b> <b>tigers</b> roam a frozen landscape, and the Dreamhouse itself turns against its occupants.|$|R
60|$|Such was {{the scene}} through which the Neanderthaler wandered, {{gathering}} such subsistence as he could from small game or fruits and berries and roots. Possibly he was mainly a vegetarian, chewing twigs and roots. His level elaborate teeth suggest a largely vegetarian dietary. But we also find the long marrow bones of great animals in his caves, cracked to extract the marrow. His weapons {{could not have been}} of much avail in open conflict with great beasts, but it is supposed that he attacked them with spears at difficult river crossings and even constructed pitfalls for them. Possibly he followed the herds and preyed upon any dead that were killed in fights, and perhaps he played the part of jackal to the <b>sabre-toothed</b> <b>tiger</b> which still survived in his day. Possibly in the bitter hardships of the Glacial Ages this creature had taken to attacking animals after long ages of vegetarian adaptation.|$|E
60|$|The great world {{summer of}} the middle Cainozoic period drew at last to an end. It was to follow those other two great summers {{in the history of}} life, the summer of the Coal Swamps and the vast summer of the Age of Reptiles. Once more the earth spun towards an ice age. The world chilled, grew milder for a time and chilled again. In the warm past {{hippopotami}} had wallowed through a lush sub-tropical vegetation, and a tremendous tiger with fangs like sabres, the <b>sabre-toothed</b> <b>tiger,</b> had hunted its prey where now the journalists of Fleet Street go to and fro. Now came a bleaker age and still bleaker ages. A great weeding and extinction of species occurred. A woolly rhinoceros, adapted to a cold climate, and the mammoth, a big woolly cousin of the elephants, the Arctic musk ox and the reindeer passed across the scene. Then century by century the Arctic ice cap, the wintry death of the great Ice Age, crept {44} southward. In England it came almost down to the Thames, in America it reached Ohio. There would be warmer spells of a few thousand years and relapses towards a bitterer cold.|$|E
60|$|The same equable climate would {{probably}} cause a more uniform distribution of moisture, and render what are now desert regions capable of supporting abundance of animal life. This {{is indicated by}} the number and variety of the species of large animals {{that have been found}} fossil in very limited areas which they evidently inhabited at one period. M. Albert Gaudry found, in the deposits of a mountain stream at Pikermi in Greece, an abundance of large mammalia such as are nowhere to be found living together at the present time. Among them were two species of Mastodon, two different rhinoceroses, a gigantic wild boar, a camel and a giraffe larger than those now living, several monkeys, carnivora ranging from martens and civets to lions and hyaenas of the largest size, numerous antelopes of at least five distinct genera, and besides these many forms altogether extinct. Such were the great herds of Hipparion, an ancestral form of horse; the Helladotherium, a huge animal bigger than the giraffe; the Ancylotherium, one of the Edentata; the huge Dinotherium; the Aceratherium, allied to the rhinoceros; and the monstrous Chalicotherium, allied to the swine and ruminants, but as large as a rhinoceros; and to prey upon these, the great Machairodus or <b>sabre-toothed</b> <b>tiger.</b> And all these remains were found in a space 300 paces long by 60 paces broad, many of the species existing in enormous quantities.|$|E

5000|$|When Ash {{arrives at}} the museum, he finds {{everything}} to be strangely quiet; Trisha and Eldridge are nowhere to be seen, and even the Deadites {{seem to be taking}} a breather. However, things soon heat up after Ash is locked in the basement and attacked by a small pack of undead <b>sabre-toothed</b> <b>tigers,</b> which he quickly defeats. Afterwards, he encounters more humanoid Deadites and acquires a card key from a dead security guard, which he uses to escape the basement, and two antique Greek vases. He finds a gasoline pump a live security guard in a locker room, who at first mistakes Ash for a Deadite and orders him to stay back until Ash provides one of his famous wisecracks. The guard tells him that he had always known that something like this would happen, and states that Nathaniel Payne had built a temple believed to be used for human sacrifice under the museum, and one day had gone down into the temple and never returned. He opens up all of the basement doors (although one is malfunctioning and automatically closes whenever Ash comes near it) and he stays there to continue with the broken door. Ash discovers Trisha and Eldridge, locked inside of the east wing by a power surge, and goes back to the basement {{to find a way to}} cut the power. He discovers a spell that allows him to possess hellhounds, and uses this spell to gain access to the malfunctioning door (which happens to also house the power grid) and blows up the generator with a stick of dynamite, freeing Trisha and Eldridge. He returns to the locker room, only to find that the guard has become a Deadite as well, and kills the guard. He finds a divining device hidden behind a portrait of Nathaniel Payne, uses it to find four magical gems, and uses these to gain access to Payne's chamber. He encounters Payne, who has long since been transformed into a demonic, fireball-launching monster, and defeats him by deflecting his fireballs back at him with the shovel. Afterwards, he grabs the Kandarian Summoning Stone and flirts with Trisha, though she has reservations about dating him, as people around town have claimed that he is crazy, perhaps even dangerous. It is soon revealed that Eldridge knew about the true nature of the Necronomicon all along, and plans to use its power and the Stone to take over the world. He opens up a vortex and disappears into it, and Ash decides to follow him. Trisha asks him if he is crazy, but he merely states that [...] "crazy is as crazy does", kisses her, and follows Eldridge into the vortex while Trisha stays behind.|$|R

Sabre-toothed members of the Carnivora appeared independently at least twice. Sabre teeth evolved both among the true cats, or the family Felidae (these sabre-toothed cats are sometimes classified in a separate subfamily of cats, the Machairodontinae) and within the Nimravidae, an extinct carnivore family that was related both to the true cats and to the civets and mongooses.
