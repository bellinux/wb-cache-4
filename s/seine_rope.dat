50|$|The {{mouth of}} Popes Creek is plugged by a flood-tide delta {{making it an}} {{efficient}} trap for sediment and enriched run-off from three primary sources: farmed watersheds consisting of broad terraces and open upland slopes, erosion of the bluffs and beaches of the Potomac, and the creek bluff erosion itself. Agriculturally derived fill deposited in adjacent ravines {{to a depth of}} 2 meters is found covering stumps from the 17th century. Beaver dams and ponds dot the flood plains as well as several old mill ponds which interrupt the flow. Historically, the navigation of the creek has been limited to shallow-draft vessels with present depth up to one meter augmented by 0.3 to 0.4 meter tide. The tributary continues to shoal as the sea level rises driving Potomac silt more than a kilometer inland. Core drilling in the delta has indicated 15 meters of mollusk-bearing sediment, over peat and sand deposits dating back over 6000 years. The taking of oysters is abundantly evident. Aboriginal shell middens were found during archeological excavations, post structure and land preparation for the Visitors’ Center at the site of George Washington’s birthplace. The 18th century refuse pit at the birthplace containing food garbage yielded shucked oyster shells as well. Fishing at the creek mouth is highlighted by the white perch run. In Captain John Smith’s explorations the fish were so thick their heads stuck out of water, prompting his men to attempt to catch them in a frying pan. The entrance to the smaller estuaries would be clogged during spring migrations including shad runs. Later colonial inventories of the Popes Creek plantation list seine corks, lead, <b>seine</b> <b>rope,</b> a knot of perch lines, yielding to the more than adequate kitchen utensil, or fish kettle, serving up the local delicacy.|$|E
40|$|Demersal Seining is {{an active}} fishing method {{applying}} two long seine ropes and a seine net. Demersal seining relies on fish responding to the <b>seine</b> <b>rope</b> as it moves during the fishing process. The seine ropes and net are deployed in a specific pattern encircling an area on the seabed. In some variants of demersal seining the haul-in procedure includes a towing phase where the fishing vessel moves forward before starting to winch in the seine ropes. The initial <b>seine</b> <b>rope</b> encircled area, the gradual change in it during the haul-in process and the fish's reaction to the moving seine ropes {{play an important role}} in the catch performance of demersal seine fishing. The current study investigates this subject by applying computer simulation models for demersal seine fishing. The demersal seine fishing is dynamic in nature and therefore a dynamic model, SeineSolver is applied for simulating the physical behaviour of the seine ropes during the fishing process. Information about the <b>seine</b> <b>rope</b> behaviour is used as input to another simulation tool, SeineFish that predicts the catch performance of the demersal seine fishing process. SeineFish implements a simple model for how fish at the seabed reacts to an approaching <b>seine</b> <b>rope.</b> Here, the SeineSolver and SeineFish tools are applied to investigate catching performance for a Norwegian demersal seine fishery targeting cod (Gadus morhua) in the coastal zone. The effect of <b>seine</b> <b>rope</b> layout pattern and the duration of the towing phase are investigated. Among the four different layout patterns investigated, the square layout pattern was predicted to perform best; catching 69 %- 86 % more fish than would be obtained with the rectangular layout pattern. Inclusion of a towing phase in the fishing process was found to increase the catch performance for all layout patterns. For the square layout pattern, inclusion of a towing phase of 15 or 35 minutes increased the catch performance by respectively 37 % and 48 % compared to fishing without a towing phase. These results highlights the importance of the selected <b>seine</b> <b>rope</b> layout pattern and the duration of the towing phase when fishermen try to maximize the catch performance of their fishery. To our knowledge this is the first time the combination of models for the physical behaviour of seine ropes and for fish behaviour in response to <b>seine</b> <b>rope</b> movements have been applied to predict catch performance for demersal seining...|$|E
40|$|Demersal Seining is {{an active}} fishing method {{which is based on}} seine ropes and a seine net. The seine ropes and net are laid out on the fishing ground {{in a way that they}} {{encircle}} an aggregation of fish. Because the area the seine ropes encircle is much larger than area swept by the seine net during the hauling process, the catching efficiency of a demersal seine depends to a large extent on the herding efficiency of the seine ropes. During the fishing operation, the fish is gradually herded by the seine ropes into the path of the net. Knowledge about how the size and shape of the area encircled by the seine ropes gradually change during the fishing process is important for an efficient fishery. The purpose of the project ”Danish Seine: Computer based Development and Operation” (MAROFF- 2 project no. 225193 / FHF 900861), funded by Research Council of Norway (RCN) and Norwegian Seafood Research Fund (FHF), is to develop software tools to investigate Danish Seine fishing. An important aspect of the research is to be able to simulate the physical behaviour of the seine ropes during the fishing process. This report describes flume tank experiments carried out with the purpose of later being able to validate a numerical simulation model for <b>seine</b> <b>rope</b> behaviour. The flume tank experiments were conducted by using two rope with varying physical properties and by varying the initial shape of ropes. The seine ropes were hauled back from the tank floor at different speeds. We applied a motion tracking system based on stereo vision with six underwater cameras to record the gradual change in the geometry of the area defined by the ropes. Information about the kinematic behaviour of the seine ropes and its dependency on its physical properties, initial layout pattern and hauling speed were acquired...|$|E
