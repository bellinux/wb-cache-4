5|$|According to the chronicles of the Hindu monastic institution, the Kanchi matha, the matha was {{temporarily}} transferred to Kumbakonam in the 1780s following {{an invasion of}} Kanchipuram by Hyder Ali of Mysore. When Tipu Sultan invaded {{the east coast of}} South India in 1784, Kumbakonam bore the brunt of his invasion. The produce fell <b>sharply</b> <b>and</b> the economy collapsed. Kumbakonam did not recover from the calamity till the beginning of the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Bautista throws three pitches: a fastball, a curveball, and a changeup. His fastball {{travels in}} the high 90mph range. His curve can break down <b>sharply,</b> <b>and</b> he learned the changeup from Pedro Martínez. Wildness had {{been a problem for}} Bautista {{throughout}} his career. He has trouble controlling his fastball and walks a great deal of hitters, which has often contributed to his departure from teams.|$|E
5|$|The Coinage Act of 1864 {{passed into}} law on April 22 of that year. After {{entering}} circulation several months later, the bronze cent and two-cent piece circulated in trade without being hoarded. The bronze alloy {{was easier to}} strike than the copper-nickel one, allowing details to be brought forth <b>sharply</b> <b>and</b> extending the life of coinage dies.|$|E

5|$|The English {{county of}} Buckinghamshire is {{bisected}} by the Chiltern Hills, which rise <b>sharply</b> <b>and</b> cross the county from northeast to southwest. Although the fertile soil and good drainage of the Chilterns provides ideal conditions for farming, the steep hills historically made travelling difficult. Few sizeable settlements developed in Buckinghamshire, and what roads existed were of poor quality.|$|E
5|$|Trading in {{the shares}} of two {{financial}} services companies, Straumur–Burðarás and Exista, resumed on 9 December: together the companies account for 12.04% of the OMX Iceland 15. The values of the shares in both companies dropped <b>sharply,</b> <b>and</b> the index closed at 394.88, down by 40.17% on the day. Trading in shares in SPRON and Kaupthing remains suspended, at prices of 1.90 krónur and 694.00 krónur respectively.|$|E
5|$|A {{large part}} of the massif is covered by ice fields and is cut by {{numerous}} glaciers, mostly flowing northwestwards on the French side; southeastwards on the Italian side and eastwards on the Swiss side. With much steeper slopes on the Italian side, many glaciers drop very <b>sharply</b> <b>and</b> some, such as the Miage Glacier and the Brenva Glacier, are very heavily covered in rock debris. The massif is itself defined by broad valleys which formed along fault lines and which have subsequently been shaped by ice during the last glacial period of the ice age.|$|E
50|$|The pair of bony tusks are {{modified}} {{teeth that}} protrude {{from the middle}} of the lower jaw and fit into special grooves on the upper jaw when the mouth is closed.

5|$|Going {{into the}} 1994 Australian Grand Prix, the final {{race of the}} 1994 season, Schumacher led Damon Hill by a single point in the Drivers' Championship. Schumacher led the race from the beginning, but on lap 35 he went off track and hit the wall with his right side wheels, {{returning}} to the track at reduced speed, and with car damage, but still leading the race. At the next corner Hill attempted {{to pass on the}} inside, but Schumacher turned in <b>sharply</b> <b>and</b> they collided. Both cars were eliminated from the race and, as neither driver scored, Schumacher took the title. The race stewards judged it a racing accident and took no action against either driver, but public opinion is divided over the incident, and Schumacher was vilified in the British media.|$|E
5|$|In the end {{the reform}} proved unsuccessful. The {{government}} only managed to withdraw 14 billion rubles from circulation of the country's money supply against an intended target of 81.5 billion rubles. As a result, the Pavlov reform did not {{put an end to}} inflation. Prices for items including food and transport rose by 100–300 percent, while the Soviet standard of living decreased <b>sharply</b> <b>and</b> the state budget deficit increased by an estimated 2030 percent of GNP. In the aftermath of the reform, inflation exceeded the 50 percent mark every month.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of humans roughly 1500 to 2000years ago, lemurs were found all across the island. However, early {{settlers}} quickly converted the forests to rice paddies and grassland through slash-and-burn agriculture (known locally as tavy), restricting lemurs to approximately 10% of the island's area, ~60,000km2 (23,000sq mi). Today, the diversity and complexity of lemur communities increases with floral diversity and precipitation and is highest in the rainforests of the east coast, where precipitation and floral diversity are also at their highest. Despite their adaptations for weathering extreme adversity, habitat destruction and hunting have resulted in lemur populations declining <b>sharply,</b> <b>and</b> their diversity has diminished, with the recent extinction of at least 17species in eight genera, known collectively as the subfossil lemurs. Most of the approximately 100species and subspecies of lemur are either threatened or endangered. Unless trends change, extinctions are likely to continue.|$|E

50|$|The quadriradiates are {{abundant}} and resemble the triradiates, {{but with an}} apical ray projecting at right angles into the gastral cavity. This ray is somewhat variable in form and size; typically it is long and slender, gradually <b>and</b> <b>sharply</b> pointed, <b>and</b> slightly undulated towards the extremity; in the type specimen it attains a length of about 0.14 mm.|$|R
5|$|The British South Africa Company had {{reservations}} about devoting all of Southern Rhodesia's {{resources to the}} war effort, {{in part because of}} its desire to keep the colonial economy operating. There was indeed tightening of belts in the Rhodesias during the war, but not on the same scale as in Britain. The retail sector suffered, prices for many basic day-to-day items rose <b>sharply,</b> <b>and</b> exports plummeted as much of the white male citizenry went overseas to war, but mining, the industry on which Rhodesia's economic viability hinged, continued to operate successfully, despite occasional difficulties in obtaining manpower. The Company administration posted record outputs of gold and coal during 1916, and began to supply the Empire with the strategic metal ferrochrome. A flurry of new prospecting ventures led to the discovery of another strategic metal, tungsten, near Essexvale in southern Matabeleland in May 1917.|$|E
5|$|On 10 March 1936, {{the pianist}} John Tobin gave a {{performance}} of Pars prima from Opus clavicembalisticum. This performance was highly inadequate, as it lasted {{twice as long as}} it should have. Sorabji left before it finished, and later denied having attended it. He gave his last public performance of his music on 16 December 1936 in Glasgow, when he premiered his Piano Toccata No. 2, and afterwards withdrew from the concert platform {{for the rest of his}} life. He later banned unauthorised performances of his music, but it remains unclear when he did so; Paul Rapoport has argued that it was probably in 1938 or 1939, but Sorabji's first announcement of it dates from 1944. Although the ban was not legally enforceable, Sorabji presented it so <b>sharply</b> <b>and</b> decisively that, for the most part, he achieved his aim. The shift in Sorabji's attitude to public performances of his music has generally been ascribed to Tobin's performance, but this explanation has also been described as simplistic. Apart from misleading reviews of his works by music critics, the deaths of people who were important to him (Busoni, Warlock, and Bernard van Dieren), the silence of Sibelius, the changes in Szymanowski's style, and the increasing prominence of Stravinsky and the late Schoenberg have all been put forward as catalysts for his decision to isolate himself from the world of music. The financial implications of his father's death have also been cited as an important factor.|$|E
