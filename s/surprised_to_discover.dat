5|$|Even Born was <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>discover</b> that Paul Dirac {{had been}} {{thinking}} {{along the same lines}} as Heisenberg. Soon Wolfgang Pauli used the matrix method to calculate the energy values of the hydrogen atom, and found that they agreed with the Bohr model. Another important contribution was made by Erwin Schrödinger, who looked at the problem using wave mechanics. This {{had a great deal of}} appeal to many at the time, as it offered the possibility of returning to deterministic classical physics. Born would have none of this, as it ran counter to facts determined by experiment. He formulated the now-standard interpretation of the probability density function for ψ*ψ in the Schrödinger equation, which he published in July 1926.|$|E
5|$|Rachel Louise Bradley is {{a fictional}} {{character}} portrayed by Helen Baxendale in the British comedy-drama television series Cold Feet. Rachel is {{introduced in the}} pilot episode (1997), where she begins a relationship with Adam Williams (James Nesbitt). Their relationship has highs and lows throughout the series; Rachel reveals a secret husband in the first series (1998) and has an abortion in the second (1999), which supposedly prevents her from conceiving {{a child in the}} future. She and Adam marry in the third series (2000) and are <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>discover</b> that she is pregnant in the fourth (2001). They both begin raising their child in the fifth series (2003), but Rachel's life is cut short when she is killed in a car crash.|$|E
5|$|Based {{on their}} {{experience}} with the ancient surfaces of the Moon, Mars, and Mercury, scientists expected to see numerous impact craters in Voyager 1s first images of Io. The density of impact craters across Io's surface would have given clues to Io's age. However, they were <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>discover</b> that the surface was almost completely lacking in impact craters, but was instead covered in smooth plains dotted with tall mountains, pits of various shapes and sizes, and volcanic lava flows. Compared to most worlds observed to that point, Io's surface was covered {{in a variety of}} colorful materials (leading Io to be compared to a rotten orange or to pizza) from various sulfurous compounds. The lack of impact craters indicated that Io's surface is geologically young, like the terrestrial surface; volcanic materials continuously bury craters as they are produced. This result was spectacularly confirmed as at least nine active volcanoes were observed by Voyager 1.|$|E

5|$|At the Los Angeles International Speedway, McQueen's mind is {{not fully}} set on the race, and he soon falls into last place. He is <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>discover</b> that Doc Hudson, who is decked out in his old racing colors, has taken over as his crew chief, along with several other friends from Radiator Springs {{to help in the}} pit. Inspired and recalling tricks he learned from Doc and his friends, McQueen quickly emerges to lead the race into the final laps. But at the last minute, Hicks, refusing to come behind Weathers again, side swipes Weathers, and sends him into a {{dangerous}} spin, causing him to crash. Seeing this and recalling Doc's fate, McQueen stops just short of the finish line, allowing Hicks to win, and drives back to push Weathers over the finish line. The crowd and media condemn Hicks' victory, but are nonetheless impressed with McQueen's sportsmanship. Though offered the Dinoco sponsorship deal, McQueen declines, insisting on staying with Rusteze as an appreciation of their past support. Later, back at Radiator Springs, McQueen returns and announces that he will be setting up his headquarters there, helping to put Radiator Springs back on the map.|$|E
5|$|The {{taxi driver}} and his {{companion}} hold Homer hostage {{deep into the}} rainforest. They force Homer {{to make a phone}} call to Marge, telling her that if the family provides 50,000 dollars to the kidnappers, he will be released. However, the Simpsons do not have enough money so they go looking for Homer instead. Walking through the streets of Rio de Janeiro, they run into a parade that features a Teleboobies float with characters from the show. Lisa is <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>discover</b> that Ronaldo is working inside the costume of the dancing flamingo from Teleboobies—a well-paid job he got after learning to dance with the shoes he bought with Lisa's donation money. Ronaldo tells Lisa that he stopped writing to her because he did not know which state she lives in, since it was the orphanage that used to send his letters. Later, Ronaldo gives the Simpsons the money they need to save Homer. Meanwhile, Homer shows the kidnappers a scrapbook he made of his kidnapping memories. Apparently, he has developed Stockholm syndrome. The family and the kidnappers then meet up high over a valley near the Sugarloaf Mountain in two separate cable cars. The Simpsons toss the kidnappers their money, and when Homer jumps into his family's cable car, the cables break, sending the family crashing into the mountainside and rolling down to the ground. They all survive unharmed, but Bart is then eaten whole by an anaconda. The episode ends with Bart dancing inside the snake to carnival music.|$|E

30|$|Our finding further {{reveals that}} {{internal}} efficacy and political participation are influential to {{urban and rural}} residents’ police trust. Take the uncertain correlation between internal efficacy and political trust in past literature in consideration (such as Morrell 2003), it was not <b>surprise</b> <b>to</b> <b>discover</b> a negative correlation between internal efficacy and police trust. Albeit the government’s response to the public’s demands can improve the latter’s trust in the political system, the respondents who have higher confidence to their own ability would expect more on government agencies. Therefore, {{it is more likely}} to evoke anti-establishment emotions and to cause lower police trust. Future research should explore more on the negative relationship between internal efficacy and political trust.|$|R

Original Ideals When Joachim Savelsberg first broached the question of an ASA section on the Sociology of Law, we struggled with two questions. What was its justification on its own terms? And what distinctive contribution could it make that was not already being made by the Law and Society Association, since it made no sense to duplicate functions or to compete? The answers to the first question were straightforward. After all, sociology’s theoretical tradition since the 19 th century took law seriously, perhaps most notably in Weber’s sociology of law and the economy. Echoes of this centralit...|$|R

Mickey is unimpressed with his father's sudden return; he refuses to forgive Mike for his prior neglect, and they fight when Mike makes derogatory comments about Rosie. Mike tries to make excuses for his absence, but Mickey refuses to believe him. They eventually call an uneasy truce, but Mike alienates his son further {{when he tries to}} con his friend Minty Peterson (Cliff Parisi) out of his life savings. Mickey enters into a relationship with Li Chong (Elizabeth Tan) in 2007, and they eventually both move into Gus Smith's (Mohammed George) flat. Li often tests the relationship, infuriating Mickey by growing cannabis in their closet, and then involving him in a money-making scam by advertising him as a male escort without his consent. With persuasion, Mickey agrees to do the male escorting, but Li proves too jealous of his flirtations with other women, so their scam soon ends. Li abruptly ends the relationship when Mickey starts getting too serious for her.|$|E

Tywin names his son Tyrion as Baelish's replacement as Master of Coin (treasurer), despite Tyrion's pointing out his lack of expertise. Later, while retrieving the ledgers for his new appointment, Lord Baelish advises Tyrion on the job. Tyrion then rewards his virgin squire Podrick Payne with the services of three prostitutes for saving his life in the Battle of the Blackwater; Tyrion is later <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> <b>discover</b> that they refuse payment due to Podrick's skill in lovemaking. While going over the books, Tyrion discovers that as treasurer Baelish has borrowed millions in gold from Tywin, as well as tens of millions from the Iron Bank of Braavos. A debt to Tywin is a problem since, regardless of his familial relationship with the king, Tyrion fears he will not forgive the debt despite the crown's dire straits. However, he is more worried about the Iron Bank, since if they are not paid back in due time they may very well begin funding the Crown's enemies.|$|E
