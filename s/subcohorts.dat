40|$|OBJECTIVE: Based on {{comparisons}} of short-term cohort studies or cross-sectional samples of patients from different calendar times, {{it has been}} suggested that present patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have a milder disease course compared with that of patients in past decades. This study was undertaken to investigate whether the course of disease activity and functional disability in patients with RA has become milder over the past several years. METHODS: We used the Nijmegen inception cohort of early RA, which included all patients with newly diagnosed RA who had attended the department of rheumatology at Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre since 1985. Patients were assessed for disease activity by the Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS 28) every 3 months and for functional disability by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) disability index (DI) every 6 months. Within the total cohort, 4 <b>subcohorts</b> were defined, based on the date of inclusion of the patients (1985 - 1990, 1990 - 1995, 1995 - 2000, 2000 - 2005). To investigate whether the course of disease activity and functional disability (over time) was different between the <b>subcohorts,</b> longitudinal regression analysis (linear mixed models) was used, with the DAS 28 and HAQ DI over time as outcome variables, respectively, and subcohort as the independent variable, correcting for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics. The treatment strategy was compared between the <b>subcohorts.</b> RESULTS: The DAS 28 at baseline and over the first 5 years of disease was lower in the more recent <b>subcohorts.</b> The HAQ DI did not show improvement but instead a trend toward worsening functional disability. Using longitudinal regression it was shown that disease activity improved early in the disease course and stabilized thereafter, and that this improvement was greater in patients in the more recent <b>subcohorts</b> and in patients with a higher baseline DAS 28. Initially, the HAQ DI also improved but stabilized thereafter, and this initial improvement was less pronounced in patients in the more recent <b>subcohorts</b> and was greater for patients with a higher baseline HAQ DI. The treatment strategy was more aggressive in the more recent <b>subcohorts,</b> as shown by a shorter duration from diagnosis to the start of treatment with prednisone or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and a greater prevalence of DMARD therapy. CONCLUSION: The course of disease activity in RA patients has become milder in more recent years. The reason for this improving trend remains to be elucidated, although the trend coincides with a more aggressive treatment strategy...|$|E

Moreover, the ranking of adjustments in the labor supply is preserved across the pension systems for the respective <b>subcohorts.</b> The increases are similar across the pension systems, although DC provides stronger incentives for work.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{survival}} data of populations of sterilized nematodes, Caenorhabditis elegans, exposed to heat shocks of different duration {{at the beginning}} of their adult lives. There are clear hormesis effects after short exposure to heat and clear debilitation effects after long exposure. Intermediate durations result in a mixture of these two effects. In this latter case, the survival curves for the control and experimental populations intersect. We show that observed effects may be explained by using a model of discrete heterogeneity. According to this model, each population of worms in the experiment is a mixture of <b>subcohorts</b> of frail, normal, and robust individuals; exposure to heat changes the initial proportion of worms in the <b>subcohorts</b> (heterogeneity distribution); and these changes depend on the duration of exposure. In other words, exposure to heat does not influence mortality rates (survival functions) in the <b>subcohorts</b> but does cause individuals to move from one subcohort to another. In a biological interpretation of this finding we hypothesize that, when coping with stress, the organisms of worms use several lines of defense. Switching these lines on and off in response to stress in individual organisms generates the spectrum of observed survival effects at the population level. We discuss possible molecular biological mechanisms of stress response and directions for further research...|$|E

We found that all of the proposed analysis methods performed reasonably well and were more efficient than a randomly sampled case-cohort sample. We conclude that these methods are well suited for the "clinical trials setting" in which subjects enter the study at time zero (at diagnosis or treatment) and a correlate of an expensive prognostic factor is collected for all study subjects at the time of entry to the study.

Thus, we also include a similar analysis for some selected types of <b>subcohorts</b> 17 in Figs. 8 and 9 in Appendix Appendix 4. Simulation results. As expected, the variation in productivity endowment ω does not imply heterogeneity in welfare effects. Yet, differences in preference parameters drive substantial dispersion in the observed welfare effects.

Acknowledging these differentiations, two main conclusions emerge. First, {{the sign of the}} median agent is preserved even for the extreme combinations of the preference parameters, which implies that the earlier conclusion is not a result of a fairly ad hoc definition of the instantaneous minimum or maximum but a feature of the reform. Second, the paths of welfare effects are strikingly similar across the pension systems. These results show that the welfare effects of increasing the retirement age are indeed universal, i.e., agents with low patience, high preference for leisure, and low productivity endowment have the same sign of the welfare effect as the representative agent.

40|$|International audienceABSTRACT BACKGROUND: It has {{recently}} been proposed that major depression disorder (MDD) may, in a heterogeneous population-based cohort, be interpreted {{in terms of a}} random-mood model. Mood fluctuations are thought to result from stressors that occur randomly in time. We have investigated whether this concept also holds for more homogeneous groups, defined by known determinants for MDD, and whether the model's parameters, susceptibility (Z) and relaxation time (T), may be evaluated and used to differentiate between <b>subcohorts.</b> MethodFrom a large epidemiological survey, the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS), data on the duration of MDD were obtained for <b>subcohorts,</b> based on gender, severity of depression, recurrence and co-morbidity with dysthymia, anxiety and somatic disorder, and were compared with random-mood simulation calculations. RESULTS: Susceptibility, Z, is empirically found to be proportional to incidence and may be identified with a risk ratio. A second scaling rule states the proportionality of mean duration with the product of Z and T. This Z-T classification proves to be more sensitive than conventional significance tests. Notably for men/women and for co-morbid anxiety, differences are seen that have previously gone unnoticed. CONCLUSIONS: Depression may be conceptualized as a disorder resulting from random-mood fluctuations, the response to which is influenced by a large variety of determinants or risk factors. The model's parameters can be evaluated and may be used in differentiating between risk factor-defined subgroups...|$|E

Underlying genetic differences across study populations could contribute to this varied response to MeHg. Studies in Drosophila have identified the cytochrome p 450 3 A (CYP 3 A) family as candidate MeHg susceptibility genes. Objectives We evaluated whether genetic variation in CYP 3 A genes influences {{the association}} between prenatal exposure to MeHg and child neuropsychological development. Methods The study population included 2639 children from three birth cohort studies: two <b>subcohorts</b> in Seychelles (SCDS) (n = 1160, 20 and 30 months of age, studied during the years 2001 – 2012), two <b>subcohorts</b> from Spain (INMA) (n = 625, 14 months of age, 2003 – 2009), and two <b>subcohorts</b> from Italy and Greece (PHIME) (n = 854, 18 months of age, 2006 – 2011). Total mercury, as a surrogate of MeHg, was analyzed in maternal hair and/or cord blood samples. Neuropsychological development was evaluated using Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID). Three functional polymorphisms in the CYP 3 A family were analyzed: rs 2257401 (CYP 3 A 7), rs 776746 (CYP 3 A 5), and rs 2740574 (CYP 3 A 4). Results There was no association between CYP 3 A polymorphisms and cord mercury concentrations. The scores for the BSID mental scale improved with increasing cord blood mercury concentrations for carriers {{of the most active}} alleles (β[95 % CI]: = 2. 9 [1. 53, 4. 27] for CYP 3 A 7 rs 2257401 GG + GC, 2. 51 [1. 04, 3. 98] for CYP 3 A 5 rs 776746 AA + AG and 2. 31 [0. 12, 4. 50] for CYP 3 A 4 rs 2740574 GG + AG).

Lower SIG levels correlated with better neurologic outcome. The highest correlation coefficient (0. 63) was in the "no cooling" <b>subcohort</b> between diffusion-weighted scores and SIG levels at 24 hours; the latter also had the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 0. 90, with positive and negative predictive values of 84 and 90 %.
