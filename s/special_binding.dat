50|$|Zagava, {{initially}} {{established as}} Antiquariat Bücherwelten in 2002, is a German imprint from Düsseldorf that publishes genre-defying literature {{with an emphasis}} on weird fiction, strange tales and novels, supernatural and horror literature in limited editions. Zagava cooperated in 2013 and 2014 with Ex Occidente Press, Bucharest. Although based in Germany all of Zagava′s books are in the English language. The imprint takes its name from an illustration by Edward Gorey. It´s founder Jonas Ploeger is a known archivist and collector of Goreyana and has a website dedicated to Edward Gorey´s non-US editions. Most of Zagava's books are issued in standard limited and numbered hardbound versions and frequently in additional special lettered subeditions with <b>special</b> <b>bindings</b> or additional extras. The books are as much about their contents as about the art of fine book-production. Birgit Nau and Jonas Ploeger are the proprietors of this press.|$|R
5000|$|It can be {{unclear what}} it means to say that a person [...] "ought to do X because it is moral, whether they like it or not". Morality is {{sometimes}} presumed {{to have some kind of}} <b>special</b> <b>binding</b> force on behaviour, but some philosophers think that, used this way, the word [...] "ought" [...] seems to wrongly attribute magic powers to morality. For instance, G. E. M. Anscombe worries that [...] "ought" [...] has become [...] "a word of mere mesmeric force". British ethicist Philippa Foot elaborates that morality does not seem to have any <b>special</b> <b>binding</b> force, and she clarifies that people only behave morally when motivated by other factors. If he is an amoral man he may deny that he has any reason to trouble his head over this or any other moral demand. Of course, he may be mistaken, and his life as well as others' lives may be most sadly spoiled by his selfishness. But this is not what is urged by those who think they can close the matter by an emphatic use of 'ought'. My argument is that they are relying on an illusion, as if trying to give the moral 'ought' a magic force. -Philippa Foot ...|$|E
50|$|This {{pattern of}} B12 {{transfer}} to a <b>special</b> <b>binding</b> protein secreted in a previous digestive step, is repeated once more before absorption. The next binding protein for B12 is intrinsic factor (IF), a protein synthesized by gastric parietal cells that is secreted in response to histamine, gastrin and pentagastrin, {{as well as the}} presence of food.In the duodenum, proteases digest R-proteins and release their bound B12, which then binds to IF, to form a complex (IF/B12). B12 must be attached to IF for it to be efficiently absorbed, as receptors on the enterocytes in the terminal ileum of the small bowel only recognize the B12-IF complex; in addition, intrinsic factor protects the vitamin from catabolism by intestinal bacteria.|$|E

The solution we propose is based on CINNI, a new calculus of explicit substitutions that makes use of a term representation that contains both the standard named notation and de Bruijn's indexed notation as special subcases. The calculus is parametric in the syntax of the object language, which allows us to apply it to different object languages such as λ-calculus, Abadi and Cardelli's object calculus (ς-calculus) and Milner's calculus of communicating mobile processes (π-calculus). As a practical result we obtain executable formal representations of these object languages in Maude with a representational distance close to zero...|$|R
