Under Henry I of England, [...] "The man whose conduct has only remotely caused death or injury is liable, it is true, but 'in hiis et similibus, ubi homo aliud intendit et aliud evenit, ubi opus accusatur non-voluntas, venialem pocius emendacionem, et honrificenciam judices <b>statuant,</b> sicut acciderit'" [...] The man who has killed by misadventure or in self-defense is liable to pay the wer but his wrong is emenable.|$|E

The study {{focuses on the}} problem of the spatial definition of the places where texts were displayed, that is, the « places of reference » recognized as such by Romans in their mental mapping of the city. The author takes as an example the bronze engraving and displaying ad <b>statuant</b> loricatam diui Iulii of Claudius' speech and of the senatusconsulta honoring Pallas in 52 AD. This display, attested in a letter written by Pliny the Younger, is used to demonstrate that a referential localisation can help one to choose among various literary and epigraphical sources. During the first century AD in Rome, the statua loricata of Caesar was a recognized spatial reference. It also suggests that a financial service of the prince was located nearby i. e., for modern historians, the financial service directed by the a rationibus. This loricata was very likely in Caesars forum. It {{remains to be seen whether}} it was the same as the equestrian statue of Caesar representing him as Alexander riding Bucephalus. The author situates this display within the general development of honorific displays in Rome, a development that shows the care taken in choosing the best possible place in which to perpetuate the hommage given.
