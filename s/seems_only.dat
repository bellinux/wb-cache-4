25|$|The {{field of}} genetic {{engineering}} remains a heated topic of discussion in today's society {{with the advent of}} gene therapy, stem cell research, cloning, and genetically modified food. While it <b>seems</b> <b>only</b> natural nowadays to link pharmaceutical drugs as solutions to health and societal problems, this relationship of biotechnology serving social needs began centuries ago.|$|E
25|$|By the 19th {{century or}} early 20th century, many villages had their {{characteristic}} manufacture, but earlier occupations were less concentrated. Some of these concentrations are less ancient than sometimes supposed. For example, chain making in Cradley Heath <b>seems</b> <b>only</b> {{to have begun}} in about the 1820s, and the Lye holloware industry is even more recent.|$|E
25|$|Elijah {{was always}} seen as deeply pious, it <b>seems</b> <b>only</b> natural {{that he would}} be pitted against an equally evil individual. This was found in the person of Lilith.

25|$|On 10 November 1940, a jostle on the Rue de Havre in Paris {{broke out}} between some Parisians and German soldiers, which {{ended with a}} man raising his fist to a German sergeant, and {{which led to a}} man named Rene Bonsergent, who <b>seems</b> <b>only</b> to have been a witness to the quarrel being arrested, through just why remains a mystery to this day. On 11 November 1940, to mark the 22nd anniversary of the French victory of 1918, {{university}} students demonstrated in Paris, which were brutally put down by the Paris police. In December 1940, the Organisation civile et militaire (OCM), which consisted of army officers and civil servants was founded to provide intelligence to the Allies.|$|E
500|$|In the East, the {{persecution}} was officially discontinued on April 30, 311, although martyrdoms in Gaza continued until May 4. Galerius, now on his deathbed, issued a proclamation to end hostilities, and give Christians {{the rights to}} exist freely under the law, and to peaceable assembly. Persecution was everywhere at an end. Lactantius preserves the Latin text of this pronouncement, describing it as an edict. Eusebius provides a Greek translation of the pronouncement. His version includes imperial titles and an address to provincials, suggesting that the proclamation is, in fact, an imperial letter. The document <b>seems</b> <b>only</b> to have been promulgated in Galerius's provinces.Among all the other arrangements that we are always making for the benefit and utility of the state, we have heretofore wished to repair all things {{in accordance with the}} laws and public discipline of the Romans, and to ensure that even the Christians, who abandoned the practice of their ancestors, should return to good sense. Indeed, for some reason or other, such self-indulgence assailed and idiocy possessed those Christians, that they did not follow the practices of the ancients, which their own ancestors had, perhaps, instituted, but according to their own will and as it pleased them, they made laws for themselves that they observed, and gathered various peoples in diverse areas. Then when our order was issued stating that they should return themselves to the practices of the ancients, many were subjected to peril, and many were even killed. Many more persevered in their way of life, and we saw that they neither offered proper worship and cult to the gods, or to the god of the Christians. Considering the observation of our own mild clemency and eternal custom, by which we are accustomed to grant clemency to all people, we have decided to extend our most speedy indulgence to these people as well, so that Christians may once more establish their own meeting places, so long as they do not act in a disorderly way. We are about to send another letter to our officials detailing the conditions they ought to observe. Consequently, in accord with our indulgence, they ought to pray to their god for our health and the safety of the state, so that the state may be kept safe on all sides, and {{they may be able to}} live safely and securely in their own homes. Galerius's words reinforce the Tetrarchy's theological basis for {{the persecution}}; the acts did nothing more than attempt to enforce traditional civic and religious practices, even if the edicts themselves were thoroughly nontraditional. Galerius does nothing to violate the spirit of the persecutionChristians are still admonished for their nonconformity and foolish practicesGalerius never admits that he did anything wrong. The admission that the Christians' god might exist is made only grudgingly. Certain early 20th-century historians have declared that Galerius's edict definitively nullified the old [...] "legal formula" [...] non licet esse Christianos, made Christianity a religio licita, [...] "on a par with Judaism", and secured Christians' property, among other things.|$|E
2500|$|... {{showed that}} the Lindelöf {{hypothesis}} {{is equivalent to the}} following statement about the zeros of the zeta function: for every ε>0, the number of zeros with real part at least 1/2+ε and imaginary part between T and T+1 is o(log(T)) as T tends to infinity. The Riemann hypothesis implies that there are no zeros at all in this region and so implies the Lindelöf hypothesis. The number of zeros with imaginary part between T and T+1 is known to be O(log(T)), so the Lindelöf hypothesis <b>seems</b> <b>only</b> slightly stronger than what has already been proved, but in spite of this it has resisted all attempts to prove it.|$|E

2500|$|Upon the {{recommendation}} of delegate Richard Henry Lee, Washington appointed Thomas Hartley as colonel of one [...] "additional" [...] regiment. Hartley was the former lieutenant colonel of the 6th Pennsylvania Battalion. Hartley had broad authority to select his own officers. Accordingly, Hartley chose as his lieutenant colonel Morgan Connor, major of the 1st Pennsylvania Regiment. Initially, Hartley's Regiment was to contain ten companies, however, Hartley <b>seems</b> <b>only</b> to have recruited eight; four from Pennsylvania, three from Maryland and one from Virginia. [...] Hartley's Regiment included a grenadier company, which was unusual for an American unit. The troops assembled at Philadelphia {{in the spring of}} 1777. On 22 May 1777 the regiment became part of the 1st Pennsylvania Brigade in Washington's main army.|$|E
2500|$|Different {{actors have}} used {{different}} regional accents in the role. The first six Doctors spoke in Received Pronunciation or [...] "BBC English", as was standard on British television at the time. Sylvester McCoy used a very mild {{version of his}} own Scottish accent in the role, and Paul McGann spoke with a faint Liverpudlian lilt. Only rarely is this even addressed in the programme. In {{the case of the}} McGann's Doctor, who is identified by American characters as [...] "British", he <b>seems</b> <b>only</b> slightly conscious of the way he sounds, responding with [...] "Yes, I suppose I am." [...] When the accent of Eccleston's Doctor is clearly described as [...] "Northern", he responds with the line [...] "Lots of planets have a North." [...] Capaldi's portrayal of the Doctor explicitly identified his own accent as [...] "Scottish" [...] after commenting on the English accents of his friends, Jenny Flint and Clara Oswald, while experiencing post-regeneration amnesia ("Deep Breath").|$|E
2500|$|Although {{research}} has been inconclusive, some findings have indicated that electronic communication negatively affects adolescents' social development, replaces face-to-face communication, impairs their social skills, and can sometimes lead to unsafe interaction with strangers. A 2015 review reported that [...] "adolescents lack awareness of strategies to cope with cyberbullying, which has been consistently {{associated with an increased}} likelihood of depression." [...] Studies have shown differences in the ways the internet negatively impacts the adolescents' social functioning. Online socializing tends to make girls particularly vulnerable, while socializing in Internet cafés <b>seems</b> <b>only</b> to affect boys academic achievement. However, other research suggests that Internet communication brings friends closer and is beneficial for socially anxious teens, who find it easier to interact socially online. The more conclusive finding has been that Internet use has a negative effect on the physical health of adolescents, as time spent using the Internet replaces time doing physical activities. However, the Internet can be significantly useful in educating teens because of the access they have to information on many various topics.|$|E

2500|$|Material {{quoted from}} a Life of Saint Germanus. These {{excerpts}} describe Germanus of Auxerre's incident with one Benlli, an inhospitable host seemingly unrelated to Vortigern {{who comes to}} an untimely end; but his servant provides hospitality and is made the progenitor of kings of Powys. They also describe Vortigern's son by his own daughter, whom Germanus raises, and Vortigern's own end caused by fire from heaven brought about by Germanus' prayers. Comparing this material with Constantius of Lyon's Life of St. Germanus of Auxerre suggests that the two {{are not the same}} person. It has been suggested that the saint mentioned here may be no more than a local saint or a tale that had to explain all the holy places dedicated to a St. Germanus or a [...] "Garmon", who may have been a Powys saint or even a bishop from the Isle of Man about the time of writing the Historia Britonum. The story <b>seems</b> <b>only</b> to be explained as a slur against the rival dynasty of Powys, suggesting that they did not descend from Vortigern but from a mere slave.|$|E
2500|$|Flying fish (gliding). There {{are over}} 50 species of flying fish {{belonging}} to the family Exocoetidae. They are mostly marine fishes of small to medium size. The largest flying fish can reach lengths of [...] but most species measure less than [...] in length. They {{can be divided into}} two-winged varieties and four-winged varieties. Before the fish leaves the water it increases its speed to around 30 body lengths per second and as it breaks the surface and is freed from the drag of the water it can be traveling at around [...] The glides are usually up to [...] in length, but some have been observed soaring for hundreds of metres using the updraft on the leading edges of waves. The fish can also make a series of glides, each time dipping the tail into the water to produce forward thrust. The longest recorded series of glides, with the fish only periodically dipping its tail in the water, was for 45 seconds (Video here [...] ). It has been suggested that the genus Exocoetus is on an evolutionary borderline between flight and gliding. It flaps its enlarged pectoral fins when airborne, but still <b>seems</b> <b>only</b> to glide, as there is no hint of a power stroke. It has been found that some flying fish can glide as effectively as some flying birds.|$|E
