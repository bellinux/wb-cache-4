40|$|I {{want you}} to write a story. Look around: what do you see? Down to the last detail, I {{want you to}} decribe it. Every dusty piece of bric-a-brac, every chipped coffee mug with a dried ring of {{yesterday}} 2 ̆ 7 s caffeine fix at the bottom, every crumpled tissue in the wastebasket…bombard me with it. Leave nothing out. Like Zeus 2 ̆ 7 s migraine that yielded Athena, your characters live in your mind before they live on the page; even your blood relatives are not linked to you as profoundly. You 2 ̆ 7 re never alone because your characters love you back, with a love that transcends infatuation. In fact, their existence renders yours tolerable. That said, you do yourself and the reader a disservice if you omit back story. We need to know everything: where Joe W attended college, what he majored in, whom he dated, and whether he knocked any of them up; why Jennifer X wore this sweater today instead of that blazer she almost put on, whether <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> to work or a cab, what type of cocktail she ordered when she met her friend Janice Y for a drink before dinner. Amid all these minutiae [...] {{and this is the}} most important point, so you might want to write it down for future reference [...] nothing is allowed to happen. Can you do it? It sounds like a big job, creating nothing out of something, but I think you can handle it. Try a few writing exercises. Have a constructive dialogue with your inner child. Put on your thinking cap. Do your best. I promise it 2 ̆ 7 ll be brilliant...|$|R
