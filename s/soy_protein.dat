40|$|The linear and {{non-linear}} {{rheological properties}} of defatted <b>soy</b> <b>proteins</b> produced by ultrafiltration-diafiltration were investigated at three temperatures. Five concentrations ranging from 10 to 30 % of the defatted Ultrafiltered-Diafiltered (UD) <b>soy</b> <b>proteins</b> were prepared. The properties of defatted UD <b>soy</b> <b>proteins</b> depended on concentration and temperature. At 10 %, defatted UD <b>soy</b> <b>proteins</b> exhibited almost viscous fluid behavior. When concentration increased or temperature decreased, {{the properties of}} <b>soy</b> <b>proteins</b> shifted into viscoelastic. The higher the concentration or the lower the temperature, the stronger of the viscoelasticity was for the <b>soy</b> <b>proteins.</b> The non-linear rheological properties were also concentration and temperature dependent. The non-linear steady shear measurements for the defatted UD <b>soy</b> <b>proteins</b> exhibited shear-thinning behavior, which can be described by a power law constitutive model. The trend of the power law exponent shift is very consistent with the linear viscoelastic behavior change with the <b>soy</b> <b>proteins</b> concentration and temperature. The {{results of this study}} can be used to direct further food and non-food applications for defatted UD <b>soy</b> <b>proteins...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Soy</b> <b>proteins</b> have {{excellent}} functional properties {{that can be}} utilized in {{improving the quality of}} processed foods. The off-flavor problem in <b>soy</b> <b>proteins</b> caused by short chain aliphatic aldehydes interacting with them makes these products unacceptable to the consumers. Upto date the complete removal of the off-flavor from soy products has not been reached. Complete reversibility of flavor binding to <b>soy</b> <b>proteins</b> was assumed in studying ligand binding to <b>soy</b> <b>proteins,</b> which is contradictory to the fact that removal of the off-flavor from <b>soy</b> <b>proteins</b> is almost not feasible. In order to test the validity of this assumption it was necessary to measure the amount of aldehyde bound to <b>soy</b> <b>proteins</b> directly. This necessitated the use of a radiolabeled aldehyde ligand;[superscript] 14 C-Heptanal was synthesized by incorporating Na[superscript] 14 CN into iodohexane by nucleophilic substitution in dimethyl sulfoxide. The resulting heptanitrile was selectively hydrogenated by diisobutyl aluminum hydride in methylene chloride at - 80 °C to yield [superscript] 14 C-heptanal. The synthesized radiolabeled aldehyde was used to study the reversibility of aldehyde flavor binding to glycinin and [beta]-conglycinin, by using exhaustive elution on a Sephadex-G- 25 m gel filtration column. Protein unfolding using urea, together with exhaustive elution was used to examine the involvement of flavor entrapment within the protein as the cause of tight interaction of aldehyde with <b>soy</b> <b>proteins.</b> Sequential blocking of some amino acid residues of the polypeptide chain was carried out to determine the functional groups involved in the tight interaction of aldehydes;The [superscript] 14 C-heptanal was synthesized in 55 % yield, while the purity was 90 % and the incorporation of the [superscript] 14 C-label was 52 %. Both <b>soy</b> <b>proteins</b> had high binding capacities for [superscript] 14 C-heptanal such that saturation was not reached at 1000 ppm [superscript] 14 C-heptanal. The interaction between [superscript] 14 C-heptanal and both <b>soy</b> <b>proteins</b> was not completely reversible due to the presence of a significant level of tight interaction. Entrapment of aldehyde and Schiff base formation with the [epsilon]-amino group of lysine were not major contributors to the tight interaction of [superscript] 14 C-heptanal with <b>soy</b> <b>proteins.</b> Hydrophobic interactions were found to be the sole contributor to tight interaction between the [superscript] 14 C-heptanal and the <b>soy</b> <b>proteins</b> in an aqueous medium...|$|R
40|$|Proteins {{that are}} used to {{fabricate}} imitation foods such as synthetic meats were evaluated for stimulative or inhibitory effects on the growth of Clostridium perfringens. Growth rate and extent were measured in thioglycolate medium without dextrose. This liquid medium contains Trypticase (BBL) which served as the protein control. For comparison, various <b>soy</b> <b>proteins,</b> synthetic meats, beef, turkey, sodium caseinate, and combinations of each were substituted for Trypticase. Meat loaf systems were also employed {{to determine the effects of}} protein additives to meat under actual meat loaf conditions. Growth of C. perfringens type A, strain S 40, was measured in the respective media at 45 C at a pH of 7. 0 and an Eh of below − 300 mv. Viable populations were enumerated by agar plate techniques on Trypticase-sulfite-yeast-citrate-agar incubated anaerobically (90 % N 2 - 10 % CO 2) for 18 hr at 35 C. When compared to Trypticase, some <b>soy</b> <b>proteins</b> had stimulative effects on the growth of C. perfringens, whereas sodium caseinate and some <b>soy</b> <b>proteins</b> were inhibitory. In liquid medium in which meat or soy meat was the source of protein, there was a marked stimulation by beef, chicken, and soy beef. Soy chicken supported growth at a rate less than observed with Trypticase. Under actual meat loaf conditions, the addition of <b>soy</b> meat or <b>protein</b> additives to beef did not affect the growth of C. perfringens. The addition of protein additives to turkey meat loaves significantly enhanced the rate of growth of C. perfringens.

40|$|Soybean {{is widely}} used in Japanese dietary pattern. Okara is a {{by-product}} generated mainly during processing of soybean. A great deal of okara has been treated as industrial waste. A lot of <b>soy</b> <b>proteins</b> which are functional components are included in okara. We have proposed a beneficial use for okara. Yoghurt-like food used in this experiment was prepared from a mixture of okara and soymilk by lactic acid fermentation. We investigated nutritional and food characteristics of this yoghurt-like food and obtained following results. <b>Soy</b> <b>proteins</b> in okara and soymilk were scarcely digested during the fermentation. Some <b>soy</b> <b>proteins</b> {{have been known to}} exhibit cholesterol-lowering effect. In the yoghurt-like food lactic acid occurred predominantly among several organic acids detected by HPLC. An improvement effect on enteric environment was expected because stachyose could not be degraded by lactic acid fermentation and it would be used by other microorganisms in intestine. The difference of isoflavone content between the unfermented food and yoghurt-like food was not observed. Soy isoflavones remained without degradation during lactic acid fermentation. These results suggested that the intake of yoghurt-like soy food would improve serum cholesterol concentration and intestinal environment...|$|R
50|$|Allergy to soy is common, and {{the food}} is listed with other foods that {{commonly}} cause allergy, such as milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish. The problem has been reported among younger children, and the diagnosis of soy allergy is often based on symptoms reported by parents and results of skin tests or blood tests for allergy. Only a few reported studies have attempted to confirm allergy to soy by direct challenge with the food under controlled conditions. It {{is very difficult to}} give a reliable estimate of the true prevalence of soy allergy in the general population. To the extent that it does exist, soy allergy may cause cases of urticaria and angioedema, usually within minutes to hours of ingestion. In rare cases, true anaphylaxis may also occur. The reason for the discrepancy is likely that <b>soy</b> <b>proteins,</b> the causative factor in allergy, are far less potent at triggering allergy symptoms than the proteins of peanut and shellfish. An allergy test that is positive demonstrates that the immune system has formed IgE antibodies to <b>soy</b> <b>proteins.</b> However, this is only a factor when <b>soy</b> <b>proteins</b> reach the blood without being digested, in sufficient quantities to reach a threshold to provoke actual symptoms.|$|R
