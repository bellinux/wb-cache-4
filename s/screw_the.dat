Corin Redgrave, {{who played}} the professor, {{was the son of}} Michael Redgrave, who starred in The Innocents, a 1961 {{adaption}} of The Turn of the <b>Screw.</b> <b>The</b> children, Flora and Miles, were played respectively by Eva Sayer and Josef Lindsay. However, due to the sexual content of the film, the child actors did not attend the preview screenings.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{were divided}} in their reviews of The Turn of the <b>Screw.</b> <b>The</b> acting and {{tone of the}} {{production}} were generally praised, but the plot's divergences from the original story were less well received. A particular disagreement concerned the film's horrific elements; some critics considered it to be genuinely scary, while others suggested that the horror was not fully effective. The original story has been much analysed owing to its ambiguity, and critics disagreed {{about the extent to}} which the film succeeded in portraying this trait. Academic analyses found the film considerably less ambiguous than the novella. The Turn of the Screw was released on DVD on 1 March 2010 in the UK and on 28 April 2015 in North America.|$|E

50|$|The threads on a {{right-handed}} screw are a right-handed helix. They are basically a long inclined plane {{wrapped around a}} cylinder such that turning <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> advances <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> back and forth along the z-axis. From {{the point of view}} of the external threads, turning <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> forces <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> up or down the inclined plane. If a screw is right-handed (most <b>screws</b> are) <b>the</b> rule is this: point your right thumb in the direction you want <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> to go and turn <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> in <b>the</b> direction of your curled right fingers.|$|R

The lock, located at adjacent boundary surfaces of parts of <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> union and <b>the</b> <b>screwed</b> components, or located at adjacent boundary surfaces of parts of <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> union alone, consists of one of several microwelding points which join at least one part of <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> union with <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> components or {{to another part of}} <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> union. <b>The</b> geometrical dimensions of the diameters of one or several microwelding points comprises {{a small part of the}} length of the circumference of adjacent boundary surfaces of parts of <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> union and <b>the</b> <b>screwed</b> parts. An optical arrangement for shaping and guiding a laser beam is fitted to a mechanical torquing head for tightening <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> union in order to place the microwelding points...|$|R

25|$|Furness Shipbuilding Co Ltd of Haverton Hill-on-Tees built London Valour in 1956 as an oil tanker. She was {{launched}} on 12 June and completed on 6 December. She was LOF's first steam turbine-driven tanker. She had twin steam turbines producing {{a total of}} 8,200 shaft horsepower between them.

25|$|Recent {{alternatives}} to DC motors are piezo motors or ultrasonic motors. These {{work on a}} fundamentally different principle, whereby tiny piezoceramic elements, vibrating many thousands of times per second, cause linear or rotary motion. There are different mechanisms of operation; one type uses the vibration of the piezo elements to step the motor in a circle or a straight line. Another type uses the piezo elements to cause a nut to vibrate or to drive a <b>screw.</b> <b>The</b> advantages of these motors are nanometer resolution, speed, and available force for their size. These motors are already available commercially, and being used on some robots.|$|E

25|$|In terms {{specific}} to <b>screws,</b> <b>the</b> helix angle {{can be found}} by unraveling the helix from <b>the</b> <b>screw,</b> representing <b>the</b> section as a right triangle, and calculating the angle that is formed.

25|$|Probably {{the oldest}} front vise design is the leg vise. It's called a leg vise {{because one of}} the bench's legs is an {{integral}} part of it - usually forming the inside jaw. The outside jaw also goes all the way to the floor - or nearly so. There is a single screw mounted between a quarter and a third of the way down that goes through both jaws with the nut on the back of the leg. Finally, there is some sort of horizontal beam at the bottom to act as a fulcrum. This beam may take the form of a board that can be adjusted by means of holes and pegs, or it can even be another <b>screw.</b> <b>The</b> leg vise is probably the simplest and least expensive of the front vises, and it is very strong.|$|E
25|$|These are folded down, so {{that the}} paper lies {{on the surface of}} the inked type. The bed is rolled under the platen, using a {{windlass}} mechanism. A small rotating handle is used called the 'rounce' to do this, and the impression is made with a screw that transmits pressure through the platen. To turn the <b>screw</b> <b>the</b> long handle attached to it is turned. This is known as the bar or 'Devil's Tail.' In a well-set-up press, the springiness of the paper, frisket, and tympan caused the bar to spring back and raise the platen, the windlass turned again to move the bed back to its original position, the tympan and frisket raised and opened, and the printed sheet removed. Such presses were always worked by hand. After around 1800, iron presses were developed, some of which could be operated by steam power.|$|E
25|$|Yoke valves (sometimes called A-clamps {{from their}} shape) {{are the most}} popular {{regulator}} connection in North America and several other countries. They clamp the high pressure inlet opening of the regulator against the outlet opening of the cylinder valve, and are sealed by an O-ring in a groove in the contact face of the cylinder valve. The user screws the clamp in place finger-tight to hold the metal surfaces of cylinder valve and regulator first stage in contact, compressing the o-ring between the radial faces of valve and regulator. When the valve is opened, gas pressure presses the O-ring against the outer cylindrical surface of the groove, completing the seal. The diver must take care not to <b>screw</b> <b>the</b> yoke down too tightly, or it may prove impossible to remove without tools. Conversely, failing to tighten sufficiently can lead to O-ring extrusion under pressure and a major loss of breathing gas. This can be a serious problem if it happens when the diver is at depth.|$|E

50|$|When a screw {{is driven}} without a pilot hole, or with too small a pilot hole, {{the core of}} <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> may bind and lead to <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> being broken. <b>The</b> {{appropriate}} pilot hole will prevent binding while providing sufficient friction to keep <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> from loosening.

The downbeat story of Elizabeth I in her decline, and Britten's score – reportedly thought by members of the premiere's audience [...] "too modern" [...] for such a gala – did not overcome what Matthews calls the [...] "ingrained philistinism" [...] of the ruling classes.
