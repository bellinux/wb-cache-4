5|$|The {{whole point}} is that we are the song. The self is coming from a state of pure awareness, from the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>being.</b> All the rest that comes about in the outward manifestation of the {{physical}} world (including all the fluctuations which end up as thoughts and actions) is just clutter. The true nature of each soul is pure consciousness. So the song is really about transcending and {{about the quality of the}} transcendent.|$|E

5|$|After this, Estelle is {{kidnapped by}} Raven, {{revealed}} to be an agent of Commandant Alexei, leader of the Knights and the mastermind behind the blastia thefts: Alexei intends to use Estelle's power and the replica of a magical sword to activate an ancient weapon called the Enduring Shrine of Zaude and remake the world, erasing the harmful blastia. After Raven decides to remain with Brave Vesperia after helping Estelle to escape with them, the group travel to Zaude to stop Alexei. They fail, and as Zaude is activated, it is {{revealed to be}} a barrier generator which kept the Adephagos sealed off from the world. As the Adephagos is released, Alexei is killed as Zaude collapses and Yuri is separated from the group after one of Flynn's subordinates attempts to kill him without Flynn's knowledge. Rescued by Duke, Yuri decides to stop the Adaphagos. During his absence, Rita discovers a means of converting blastia cores into spirits, which can process aer into a less-dangerous alternate energy called mana, stabilizing the aer krene and keeping Estelle's powers in check. In turn, the mana could power a weapon capable of destroying the Adephagos. After receiving permission from the world's leaders {{to carry out their}} plan, Brave Vesperia must confront Duke aboard the city-sized weapon Tarqaron. Duke intends to convert all of human life, including himself, into energy to power the weapon and destroy the Adephagos, returning the world to a more primal <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>being.</b> While they share some goals, they are forced to fight due to their conflicting methods. After defeating Duke, Yuri attempts to use the converted blastia energy against Adaphagos, but it proves insufficient. Moved by Brave Vesperia's efforts, Duke provides the extra power and Adaphagos is destroyed. The Entelexeia that formed the Adaphagos are then converted into spirits to revitalize the planet. A post-credits scene shows Brave Vesperia continuing their adventures.|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 39 - 40). This thesis describes the development and validation phics. of a new mathematical paradigm for cartoon-like motion based on Toon Physical laws. In this paradigm, three <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> evolve independently and simultaneously. The <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> are the Newtonian <b>State,</b> the <b>State</b> <b>of</b> Anticipation, and the <b>State</b> <b>of</b> Cluelessness. Switching between <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> causes cartoon-like motion to arise. An Object Oriented Design was implemented in a demonstration program to test the paradigm. The resulting program generates cartoon-like animated sequences, in real time, for a simple spherical character undergoing a number of pratfalls. Secondary motion for {{the character}} is also generated by the program using an extension of free-form deformations...|$|R

25|$|Even among Chinese Buddhist {{schools that}} are non-devotional, Guanyin is still highly venerated.

25|$|Consciousness is {{described}} as a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>being,</b> very closely related to God. The consciousness within the normal person is said to be 97% asleep. Consciousness asleep is consciousness that is subconscious, unconscious, or infraconscious, which are various levels of psychological sleep. Psychological sleep is a way to describe the lack of self-awareness, meaning that the common and ordinary person is not aware of 97% of what constitutes the ordinary <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>being.</b> A consciousness asleep is caused by what Aun Weor calls identification, fascination, or the incorrect transformation of impressions, which all imply a type of consciousness that is not aware of its own processes. It is said that to awaken consciousness one must understand that his or her consciousness is asleep. This implies that one must begin to understand every impulse, action, thought and movement one makes, a feat that is said to be accomplished through the mental discipline of meditation and self-observation. Furthermore, it is stated that the awakening of consciousness {{is the only way to}} acquiring gnosis and achieve a true and radical change by removing the spurious psychological aggregates that cause unnecessary suffering. The awakening of consciousness goes hand in hand with the transmutation of sexual energy because the higher states of consciousness depend upon the energy of sexual transmutation.|$|E
25|$|As most {{traditional}} houses in Indonesia, spatial orientation and hierarchy are crucial considerations in Balinese architecture. The concept {{is based on}} the Hindu dharma principle: every objects in the universe is conceived as having an ideal location; this must be correctly aligned at all time in order to achieve harmony with the universe, and thus moksha – the point of liberation where a human achieves a perfect <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> – can be achieved. The placement of objects in Balinese architecture naturally plays an important role to achieve this.|$|E
