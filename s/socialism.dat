5|$|The last tenet, 'socialism', did {{not mean}} <b>socialism</b> as it is defined in the West, but rather a unique form of Arab <b>socialism.</b> Aflaq coined the word Arab <b>socialism</b> for his variant of <b>socialism.</b> <b>Socialism,</b> in its {{original}} form in the Arab world had, according to Aflaq, first come into being {{under the rule of}} Muhammad. The point of Arab <b>socialism</b> was not to answer questions such as: how much state control was necessary, or economic equality; but instead Arab <b>socialism</b> was a system that freed the Arab people from oppression and enslavement, which in turn created independent individuals.|$|E
5|$|From {{his early}} student years, Dmowski {{was opposed to}} <b>socialism</b> and {{suspicious}} of federalism; he desired Polish independence and a strong Polish state, and saw <b>socialism</b> and conciliatory federalist policies as prioritizing an international idea over the national one. Over the years he became an influential European nationalist thinker.|$|E
5|$|King {{supported}} {{the ideals of}} democratic <b>socialism,</b> although {{he was reluctant to}} speak directly of this support due to the anti-communist sentiment being projected throughout the United States at the time, and the association of <b>socialism</b> with communism. King believed that capitalism could not adequately provide the basic necessities of many American people, particularly the African-American community.|$|E

5|$|During the {{communist}} era, {{the legacy of}} Kafka's work for Eastern bloc <b>socialism</b> was hotly debated. Opinions ranged from {{the notion that he}} satirised the bureaucratic bungling of a crumbling Austria-Hungarian Empire, to the belief that he embodied the rise of <b>socialism.</b> A further key point was Marx's theory of alienation. While the orthodox position was that Kafka's depictions of alienation were no longer relevant for a society that had supposedly eliminated alienation, a 1963 conference held in Liblice, Czechoslovakia, on the eightieth anniversary of his birth, reassessed the importance of Kafka's portrayal of bureaucracy. Whether or not Kafka was a political writer is still an issue of debate.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{principles}} of New Labour existed in the post-war socialist revisionism of Anthony Crosland. Crosland emphasised that Labour should not just focus on nationalisation and social welfare, but attempt to reform education, resolve wealth inequality, and pursue better industrial relations. His work The Future of <b>Socialism</b> stressed the idea that <b>socialism</b> is moral and should pursue liberty, fellowship, social justice, and equality. This required the redistribution of wealth through a progressive tax system, rendering public ownership {{of the means of}} production, enshrined in Clause IV of Labour's constitution, unnecessary. Crosland also proposed that education reform allow greater egalitarianism, proposing the abolition of the eleven plus exam.|$|E

5|$|Trotsky and his {{supporters}} had been organised since 1923 as the Left Opposition. They opposed the bureaucratisation of the Soviet Union, which they analysed as being partly caused by the poverty and isolation of the Soviet economy. Stalin's theory of <b>socialism</b> in one country was developed in 1924 as an opposition to Trotsky's Theory of Permanent Revolution, which argued that capitalism was a world system and required a world revolution in order {{to replace it with}} <b>socialism.</b> Prior to 1924, the Bolsheviks' international perspective had been guided by Trotsky's position. Trotsky argued that Stalin's theory represented the interests of bureaucratic elements in direct opposition to the working class.|$|E

5|$|In Britain, he photographed sites {{associated}} with the prominent Marxists Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin. He also photographed the signs erected by landowners and religious groups, believing that in doing so he was documenting the traces of capitalist society before they would be swept away by <b>socialism.</b> Both in Britain and {{on a visit to}} Germany he photographed pro-fascist and anti-fascist propaganda and graffiti. Like many leftists at the time, he believed that fascism was a temporary, extreme expression of capitalist society that would soon be overcome by <b>socialism.</b> He nevertheless expressed admiration for the German archaeological establishment under the Nazi government, highlighting that the British state lagged far behind in terms of funding excavations and encouraging the study of archaeology in universities; he refrained from commenting on the political agenda that the Nazis had in promoting archaeology.|$|E

25|$|The {{confusion}} regarding Stalin's {{position on}} the issue {{stems from the fact}} that he, after Lenin's death in 1924, successfully used Lenin's argument– the argument that <b>socialism's</b> success needs the workers of other countries in order to happen– to defeat his competitors within the party by accusing them of betraying Lenin and, therefore, the ideals of the October Revolution.|$|R

5|$|The CCP {{views the}} world as {{organized}} into two opposing camps; socialist and capitalist. They insist that <b>socialism,</b> {{on the basis of}} historical materialism, will eventually triumph over capitalism. In recent years, when the party has been asked to explain the capitalist globalization occurring, the party has returned to the writings of Karl Marx. Despite admitting that globalization developed through the capitalist system, the party's leaders and theorist argue that globalization is not intrinsically capitalist. The reason being that if globalization was purely capitalist, it would exclude an alternative socialist form of modernity. Globalization, as with the market economy, therefore does not have one specific class character (neither socialist nor capitalist) according to the party. The insistence that globalization is not fixed in nature comes from Deng's insistence that China can pursue socialist modernization by incorporating elements of capitalism. Because of this there is considerable optimism within the CCP that despite the current capitalist dominance of globalization, globalization can be turned into a vehicle supporting <b>socialism.</b>|$|E
