50|$|The {{magnetostatic energy}} is the energy {{stored in the}} field {{generated}} by a material's magnetic moments.

In {{contrast to the}} established magnetic circuits where the magnetic field for {{the control of the}} magnetorheological fluid is generated by the coil of an electromagnet, hybrid magnetic circuits consisting of at least one permanent or <b>hard</b> <b>magnet</b> and an electromagnet are used in the new approaches.
