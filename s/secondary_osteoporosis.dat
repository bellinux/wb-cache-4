40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this multicenter {{descriptive}} study {{is to determine the}} preferences of physiatrists in our country for anti-osteoporotic drugs in patients with primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>osteoporosis.</b> Materials and Methods: This study was carried out in 10 provinces of Turkey. The diagnosis of osteoporosis was based on World Health Organization criteria using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Patients with a spine and/or hip T-score ≤- 2. 5 were considered as osteoporotic. 714 patients over 18 years old with primary or <b>secondary</b> <b>osteoporosis</b> were included in the study. In addition to socio-demographic characteristics and chronic use of medications and/or additional systemic diseases that cause <b>secondary</b> <b>osteoporosis</b> were questioned and antiosteoporotic drugs that are recommended by their physicians were recorded. Results: The physicians’ preferred vitamin D and calcium as the prior treatment both in primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>osteoporosis.</b> The most commonly used anti-osteoporotic agent was alendronate from the biphosphonate group. It was followed by ibandronate, risedronate, strontium ranelate, calcitonin, zoledronate, raloxifene, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in the primary osteoporosis and risedronate, ibandronate, calcitonin, strontium ranelate, zoledronate, PTH, HRT and raloxifene in the <b>secondary</b> <b>osteoporosis,</b> respectively. Conclusion: The physician should choose the most suitable treatment for the patient based on fracture risk, medical history, previous treatments for osteoporosis, concomitant diseases, treatment-induced risks and benefits, and the relation between financial cost and potential benefit.

40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} the clinical and etiological factors of osteoporosis. We also tested the FRAX algorithm {{to compare the}} assessment of fracture risk in patients with primary or <b>secondary</b> <b>osteoporosis.</b> Methods. A prospective study carried out in a large sample of 123 men and 246 women. All subjects had a biochemical, densitometric, and radiological examination of thoracic and lumbar spine. Results. The prevalence of primary (men 52. 9 % vs women 50 %; p = nonsignificant) and secondary (men 21. 1 % vs women 17. 5 %; p = nonsignificant) osteoporosis did not differ between the sexes. In contrast, the prevalence of primary osteoporosis {{was significantly higher than}} secondary causes (p < 0. 0001) in both men and women. While women came to our attention for prevention of osteoporosis, men sought help because of clinical symptoms or disease-related complications, such as fractures. As evaluated by the FRAX tool, patients with osteopenia do not need treatment, in agreement with Italian guidelines. The estimated risk of major osteoporotic and hip fractures was significantly higher in women with <b>secondary</b> <b>osteoporosis</b> compared to men and also compared to women with primary osteoporosis. Conclusion. The prevalence of <b>secondary</b> <b>osteoporosis</b> in men is similar to that in women and it is less frequent than commonly reported.

40|$|Background: As {{more and}} more {{patients}} meeting the criteria for osteoporosis are referred to a fracture and osteoporosis outpatient clinic (FO clinic), the laboratory costs to screen for <b>secondary</b> <b>osteoporosis</b> also increases. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the value of screening on underlying diseases at an FO clinic by obtaining a standard set of laboratory tests. Methods: We included all 541 patients ≥ 50 years with a fracture referred to our FO clinic, during the period January 2005 to January 2007. The bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry and expressed as a T score. A standard set of laboratory tests was obtained to screen on underlying diseases. Results: Laboratory results were as often abnormal in patients with a normal BMD compared to patients with a low BMD. Underlying diseases were infrequently diagnosed. However, the prevalence of <b>secondary</b> <b>osteoporosis</b> in men was quite high, up to 18. 2 %. The costs to diagnose 1 patient with an underlying disease did vary between € 92 and € 972 depending on the group of patients described.
