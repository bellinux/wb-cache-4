50|$|The complex {{motion of}} the <b>subtalar</b> joint occurs in three planes and {{produces}} <b>subtalar</b> inversion and eversion. Along with the transverse tarsal joint (i.e. talonavicular and calcaneocuboid joint), the <b>subtalar</b> joint transforms tibial rotation into forefoot supination and pronation. The axis of rotation in the joint is directed upward 42 degrees from the horizontal plane and 16 degrees medially from the midline of the foot. However, together, the <b>subtalar</b> facets form a screw or Archimedean spiral, right-handed in the right foot, about which <b>subtalar</b> motion occurs. So, during <b>subtalar</b> inversion, the calcaneus also rotates clockwise and translates forward along the axis of the screw. Average <b>subtalar</b> motion is 20-30 degrees inversion and 5-10 degrees eversion. Functional motion during the gait cycle is 10-15 degrees (the heel strikes the ground in slight inversion followed by quick eversion).|$|E
50|$|The <b>subtalar</b> joint {{can also}} be {{considered}} a combination of the anatomic <b>subtalar</b> joint discussed above, and also the talocalcaneal part of the talocalcaneonavicular joint. This is the more common view of the <b>subtalar</b> joint when discussing its movement. When both of these articulations are accounted together, it allows for pronation and supination to occur.|$|E
50|$|The {{motions of}} the <b>subtalar</b> and {{transverse}} talar joints interact to make the foot either flexible or rigid. With the <b>subtalar</b> joint in eversion, the two joints of the transverse joint are parallel, which make movements in this joint possible. With the <b>subtalar</b> joint in inversion, the axes of the transverse joint are convergent, movements in this joint are thus locked and the midfoot rigid.|$|E
50|$|The <b>subtalar</b> joint is {{particularly}} susceptible to arthritis, {{especially when it}} has previously been affected by sprains. Symptoms of <b>subtalar</b> joint arthritis include pain when walking, loss of motion through the joint's range of motion, and difficulty walking on uneven surfaces. Physical therapy, orthotics, and surgery are the main treatment options.|$|E
50|$|The talar shelf is {{typically}} involved in <b>subtalar</b> or talocalcaneal tarsal coalition.|$|E

50|$|Calcaneal {{fractures}} are {{categorized as}} intra-articular or extra-articular {{on the basis}} of <b>subtalar</b> joint involvement. Intra-articular fractures are more common and involve the posterior talar articular facet of the calcaneus. The Sanders classification groups these fractures into four types based on the location of the fracture at the posterior articular surface. Extra-articular fractures are less common and may be located anywhere outside the <b>subtalar</b> joint. Extra-articular fractures are categorized depending on whether the involvement of the calcaneus is anterior (Type A), middle (Type B) or posterior (Type C).|$|E
50|$|Conventional {{radiography}} {{is usually}} the initial assessment tool when a calcaneal fracture is suspected. Recommended x-ray views are (a) axial, (b) anteroposterior, (c) oblique and (d) views with dorsiflexion and internal rotation of the foot. However, conventional radiography is limited for visualization of calcaneal anatomy, especially at the <b>subtalar</b> joint. A CT scan is currently the imaging study of choice for evaluating calcaneal injury and has substituted conventional radiography in the classification of calcaneal fractures. Axial and coronal views are obtained for proper visualization of the calcaneus, <b>subtalar,</b> calcaneocuboid and talonavicular joints.|$|E
50|$|In human anatomy, the <b>subtalar</b> joint, {{also known}} as thetalocalcaneal joint, is a joint of the foot. It occurs at the meeting point of the talus and the calcaneus.|$|E

50|$|After being {{selected}} in the Boomers squad for the Sino-Australia Challenge against China in June 2013, Madgen sustained a right ankle <b>subtalar</b> dislocation during training only a day after Game 1 of the four-game series.|$|E
50|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1982, Tejas broke his ankle while rock {{climbing}} in Yosemite. The doctors had to wait {{a week for the}} swelling to subside before setting the fracture with a cast. The stress the ankle was subjected to over the years took its toll. The pursuits of a mountaineer and a high altitude alpine mountain guide had destroyed the cartilage in between the <b>subtalar</b> joint. In 2010, S. Robert Rozbruch, M.D. of the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City utilized the Ilizarov technique and injected stem cells into the fixated <b>subtalar</b> joint to stimulate the growth of cartilage. The procedure is known as ankle distraction.|$|E
50|$|During {{the loading}} {{phase of the}} running and walking cycle, the ankle and foot {{naturally}} pronate and supinate by approximately 5 degrees. Excessive pronation of the foot (over 5 degrees) in the <b>subtalar</b> joint {{is a type of}} mechanical mechanism that can lead to tendinitis.|$|E
50|$|The {{talus bone}} or ankle bone is {{connected}} superiorly {{to the two}} bones of the lower leg, the tibia and fibula, to form the ankle joint or talocrural joint; inferiorly, at the <b>subtalar</b> joint, to the calcaneus or heel bone. Together, the talus and calcaneus form the hindfoot.|$|E
5000|$|... 1. The calcaneal {{internal}} rotation (adduction) and plantar flexion {{is the key}} deformity. The foot is adducted and plantar-flexed at the <b>subtalar</b> joint, and {{the goal is to}} abduct the foot and dorsiflex it. In order to achieve correction of the clubfoot, the calcaneus should be allowed to rotate freely under the talus bone, which also is free to rotate in the ankle mortise. The correction takes place through the normal arc of the <b>subtalar</b> joint. This is achieved by placing the index finger of the operator on the medial malleolus to stabilize the leg and levering on the thumb placed on the lateral aspect head of the talus while abducting the forefoot in supination. Forcible attempts at correcting the heel varus by abducting the forefoot while applying counter pressure at the calcaneocuboid joint prevents the calcaneus from abducting and therefore everting.|$|E
50|$|The calcaneofibular {{ligament}} is a narrow, rounded cord, {{running from}} the tip of the lateral malleolus of the fibula downward and slightly backward to a tubercle on the lateral surface of the calcaneus. It is part of the lateral collateral ligament, which opposes the hyperinversion of the <b>subtalar</b> joint, as in a common type of ankle sprain.|$|E
50|$|In anatomy, {{pronation}} is a {{rotational movement}} of the forearm (at the radioulnar joint) or foot (at the <b>subtalar</b> and talocalcaneonavicular joints). Pronation of the foot refers to how the body distributes weight as it cycles through the gait. During the gait cycle the foot can pronate {{in many different ways}} based on rearfoot and forefoot function. Types of pronation include neutral pronation, underpronation (supination), and overpronation.|$|E
50|$|The {{hindfoot}} {{is composed}} of the talus (or ankle bone) and the calcaneus (or heel bone). The two long bones of the lower leg, the tibia and fibula, {{are connected to the}} top of the talus to form the ankle. Connected to the talus at the <b>subtalar</b> joint, the calcaneus, the largest bone of the foot, is cushioned underneath by a layer of fat.|$|E
50|$|Triple {{arthrodesis}} is {{a surgical}} procedure whose {{purpose is to}} relieve pain in the rear part of the foot, improve stability of the foot, {{and in some cases}} correct deformity of the foot, by fusing of the three main joints of the hindfoot: the <b>subtalar</b> joint, calcaneocuboid joint and the talonavicular joint. It is commonly carried out on patients with joint degeneration resulting from arthritis or a severe flat foot deformity.|$|E
5000|$|The bony arch {{formed by}} the tibial plafond and the two malleoli is {{referred}} to as the ankle [...] "mortise" [...] (or talar mortise). The mortise is a rectangular socket. The ankle is composed of three joints: the talocrural joint (also called talotibial joint, tibiotalar joint, talar mortise, talar joint), the <b>subtalar</b> joint (also called talocalcaneal), and the Inferior tibiofibular joint. The joint surface of all bones in the ankle are covered with articular cartilage.|$|E
50|$|The {{bones of}} the tarsus are the rear most bones in the {{adjacent}} diagram: calcaneus, talus, navicular, cuboid, medial cuneiform, intermediate cuneiform and lateral cuneiform bones. These bones create the two major foot joints - the <b>subtalar</b> and midtarsal joints - that allow complex motions {{to occur in the}} feet. These motions are necessary for such activities as walking over uneven terrain and creating a gait that allows normal function of the knees, hips, back, etc.|$|E
50|$|Pronation is {{a natural}} {{movement}} of the foot that occurs during foot landing while running or walking. Composed of three cardinal plane components: <b>subtalar</b> eversion, ankle dorsiflexion, and forefoot abduction, these three distinct motions of the foot occur simultaneously during the pronation phase. Pronation is a normal, desirable, and necessary component of the gait cycle. Pronation is {{the first half of}} the stance phase, whereas supination starts the propulsive phase as the heel begins to lift off the ground.|$|E
50|$|The human foot is {{a strong}} and complex {{mechanical}} structure containing 26 bones, 33 joints (20 of which are actively articulated), {{and more than a}} hundred muscles, tendons, and ligaments. The joints of the foot are the ankle and <b>subtalar</b> joint and the interphalangeal articulations of the foot. An anthropometric study of 1197 North American adult Caucasian males (mean age 35.5 years) found that a man's foot length was 26.3 cm {{with a standard deviation of}} 1.2 cm.|$|E
5000|$|The normal {{biomechanics}} of {{the foot}} are designed to absorb and direct the force occurring throughout the gait cycle, whereas the foot is flexible (pronation) and rigid (supination) during different phases of the gait cycle. As the foot is loaded, eversion of the <b>subtalar</b> joint, dorsiflextion of the ankle, and abduction of the forefoot occur. Pronation should not occur past the latter stages of midstance, as the normal foot should then supinate in preparation for toe-off.|$|E
5000|$|The ankle, or the talocrural region, is {{the region}} where the foot and the leg meet. The ankle {{includes}} three joints: the ankle joint proper or talocrural joint, the <b>subtalar</b> joint, and the inferior tibiofibular joint. The movements produced at this joint are dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the foot. In common usage, the term ankle refers exclusively to the ankle region. In medical terminology, [...] "ankle" [...] (without qualifiers) can refer broadly to the region or specifically to the talocrural joint.|$|E
5000|$|The midfoot is the {{intermediate}} {{portion of the}} foot between the hindfoot and forefoot. The structures in this region are intermediate in size, and typically transmit loads from the hindfoot to the forefoot. The human transverse tarsal joint of the midfoot transmits forces from the <b>subtalar</b> joint in the hindfoot to the forefoot joints (metatarsophalangeal and interphalangeal) and associated bones (metatarsals and phalanges). [...] The midfoot of the dog, horse and elephant contains similar intermediate structures having similar functions {{to those of the}} human midfoot.|$|E
5000|$|The Angle of Gissane, or [...] "Critical Angle", is {{the angle}} {{formed by the}} {{downward}} and upward slopes of the calcaneal superior surface. On a lateral radiograph, an angle of Gissane > 130° suggests fracture of the posterior <b>subtalar</b> joint surface. Bohler's angle, or the [...] "Tuber Angle", is another normal anatomic landmark seen in lateral radiographs. It is formed by the intersection of 1) {{a line from the}} highest point of the posterior articular facet to the highest point of the posterior tuberosity, and 2) a line from the former to the highest point on the anterior articular facet. Bohler's angle is normally 25° to 40°. A decreased angle is indicative of a calcaneal fracture.|$|E
50|$|Born in 1947 {{in rural}} South Australia, Nitschke studied {{physics at the}} University of Adelaide, gaining a PhD from Flinders University in laser physics in 1972. Rejecting {{a career in the}} sciences, he instead {{travelled}} to the Northern Territory to take up work with the Aboriginal land rights activist Vincent Lingiari and the Gurindji at Wave Hill. After the hand-back of land by the then Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, Nitschke became a Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife ranger. However, after badly injuring his <b>subtalar</b> joint, which effectively finished his career as a ranger, he began studying for a medical degree. In addition to having long been interested in studying medicine he has suffered from hypochondria most of his adult life and futilely hoped with his medical studies to educate himself out of the problem. He graduated from the University of Sydney Medical School in 1989.|$|E
40|$|Primary <b>subtalar</b> {{arthritis}} is not common. In most cases, it is {{the late}} sequela of intra-articular calcaneal fracture.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{observation}} of 9 patients after <b>subtalar</b> arthroereisis with developed different complications from 2008 to 2011 were presented. In 7 patients <b>subtalar</b> arthroereisis {{was held in}} conjunction with surgical correction of forefoot, in 2 patients {{was carried out in}} isolation. All complications were divided into 4 groups: talar sinus syndrome, the migration of <b>subtalar</b> implant, overcorrection of deformation, the <b>subtalar</b> implant destruction. Development of talar sinus syndrome after <b>subtalar</b> arthroereisis was associated with the using of too large implant. The implant migration was associated with failure to topographical requirements for its installation, as well as the inadequate size of it. Overcorrection of deformation was observed in cases where the <b>subtalar</b> implant was introduced deeper than the required. In cases of migration of implant «Vilex» its reimplantation was performed, while in other cases the implant was removed to eliminate the pain. In order to prevent complications after <b>subtalar</b> arthroereisis the topography of the <b>subtalar</b> implant in the sinus area and adhearance to the technology should take into account...|$|E
40|$|A case of {{complicated}} lateral <b>subtalar</b> dislocation is presented and the literature concerning this injury is reviewed. <b>Subtalar</b> joint dislocations are rare {{and often the}} result of a high-energy trauma. Complications include avascular necrosis of the talus, infection, posttraumatic osteoarthritis requiring arthrodesis and chronic <b>subtalar</b> instability. Negative prognostic factors include lateral and complicated dislocations, total talar extrusions, and associated fractures. A literature search was performed to identify studies describing outcome after lateral <b>subtalar</b> joint dislocation. Eight studies including fifty patients could be included, thirty out of 50 patients suffered a complicated injury. Mean follow-up was fifty-five months. Ankle function was reported as good in all patients with closed lateral <b>subtalar</b> dislocation. Thirteen out of thirty patients with complicated lateral <b>subtalar</b> joint dislocation developed a complication. Avascular necrosis was present in nine patients with complicated injury. Four patients with complicated lateral <b>subtalar</b> dislocation suffered deep infection requiring treatment with antibiotics. In case of uncomplicated lateral <b>subtalar</b> joint dislocation, excellent functional outcome after closed reduction and immobilization can be expected. In case {{of complicated}} lateral <b>subtalar</b> joint dislocation immediate reduction, wound debridement and if necessary (external) stabilisation are critical. Up to fifty percent of patients suffering complicated injury are at risk of developing complications such as avascular talar necrosis and infection...|$|E
30|$|Whether the <b>subtalar</b> joint {{should be}} {{included}} in an ankle fusion is a matter of individual judgement of clinical and radiological signs [6, 8, 15, 16, 21]. Talar changes such as cyst formation and partial talar necrosis indicate degeneration of the <b>subtalar</b> joint. A local anaesthetic injection may be of value to determine <b>subtalar</b> pain [15, 16]. In cases of severe equinovarus deformity, especially of neurogenic origin, fusion of the <b>subtalar</b> joint is an essential step in achieving and maintaining correction.|$|E
