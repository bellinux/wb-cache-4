5|$|Early in most plots Bond {{is called}} in to see M, {{the head of the}} UK's Secret Intelligence Service (also known as MI6) in his or her office to receive his assignment. In several films, Bond {{receives}} the assignment outside the MI6 offices, or at a local secret office. Bond often finds M in a subdued <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>agitation</b> over a new threat to world peace. M typically shows confidence in the service's best agent but feels a need to rein in Bond for his risky methods and often chides him for his indiscretions.|$|E
5|$|A {{rapprochement}} {{between the}} two men was achieved in the winter of 1384, when Carrouges and Le Gris were both invited to the estate of a mutual friend, Jean Crespin, to celebrate the birth of his son. For the first time, Carrouges brought his wife Marguerite into society and it was at this party that she made her first acquaintance with Le Gris. Despite the tension between them, Carrouges and Le Gris shook hands and drank together, putting their quarrel behind them before their peers and neighbours. A few months later Jean de Carrouges departed on campaign to Scotland and Le Gris took the opportunity to increase his influence with the Count, making substantial financial and territorial gains in the his rival's absence. Carrouges returned a year later, now a knight but bankrupt, ill and suffering the aftermath of a long and unsuccessful campaign. When Carrouges appeared at Argentan in January 1386 he was involved in a confrontation with his erstwhile friend. Although it is not known what was said, the two men separated on poor terms and Carrouges departed for Paris in a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>agitation.</b>|$|E
25|$|An object either (1) is {{immediate}} to a sign, {{and that}} is the object as represented in the sign, or (2) is a dynamic object, which is the object as it really is, on which the immediate object is founded. Usually, an object in question, such as Hamlet or the planet Neptune, is a special or partial object. A sign's total object is the object's universe of discourse, the totality of things in that world to which one attributes the object. An interpretant is either (1) immediate to a sign, for example a word's usual meaning, a kind of interpretive quality or possibility present in the sign, or (2) dyanamic, an actual interpretant, for example a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>agitation,</b> or (3) final or normal, a question's true settlement, which would be reached if thought or inquiry were pushed far enough, a kind of norm or ideal end with which any actual interpretant may, at most, coincide.|$|E

2500|$|An interpretant (or interpretant sign) is a sign's {{meaning or}} {{ramification}} as formed {{into a kind}} of idea or effect, an interpretation, human or otherwise. An interpretant is a sign (a) of the object and (b) of the interpretant's [...] "predecessor" [...] (the interpreted sign) {{as a sign of the}} same object. An interpretant either (i) is immediate to a sign and is a kind of quality or possibility such as a word's usual meaning, or (ii) is a dynamic interpretant, such as a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>agitation,</b> or (iii) is a final or normal interpretant, a sum of the lessons which a sufficiently considered sign would have as effects on practice, and with which an actual interpretant may at most coincide.|$|E
2500|$|The term blues {{may have}} come from [...] "blue devils", meaning melancholy and sadness; an early use of the term in this sense is in George Colman's one-act farce Blue Devils (1798). The phrase blue devils may also have been derived from Britain in the 1600s, when the term {{referred}} to the [...] "intense visual hallucinations that can accompany severe alcohol withdrawal". [...] As time went on, the phrase lost the reference to devils, and [...] "it came to mean a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>agitation</b> or depression." [...] By the 1800s in the United States, the term blues was associated with drinking alcohol, a meaning which survives in the phrase blue law, which prohibits the sale of alcohol on Sunday. Though the use of the phrase in African-American music may be older, it has been attested to in print since 1912, when Hart Wand's [...] "Dallas Blues" [...] became the first copyrighted blues composition. In lyrics the phrase is often used to describe a depressed mood. Some sources state that the term blues is related to [...] "blue notes", the flatted, often microtonal notes used in blues, but the Oxford English Dictionary claims that the term blues came first and led to the naming of [...] "blue notes".|$|E
2500|$|Although Vivekananda did {{not write}} any commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita, his works {{contained}} numerous references to the Gita, such as his lectures on the four yogas – Bhakti, Gyaana, Karma, and Raja. Through {{the message of the}} Gita, Vivekananda sought to energise the people of India to claim their own dormant but strong identity. Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay thought that the answer to the problems that beset Hindu society was a revival of Hinduism in its purity, which lay in the reinterpretation of Bhagavad Gita for a new India. Aurobindo saw Bhagavad Gita as a [...] "scripture of the future religion" [...] and suggested that Hinduism had acquired a much wider relevance through the Gita. Sivananda called Bhagavad Gita [...] "the most precious jewel of Hindu literature" [...] and suggested its introduction into the curriculum of Indian schools and colleges. In the lectures Chinmayananda gave, on tours undertaken to revive of moral and spiritual values of the Hindus, he borrowed the concept of Gyaana yajna, or the worship to invoke divine wisdom, from the Gita. He viewed the Gita as a universal scripture to turn a person from a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>agitation</b> and confusion to a state of complete vision, inner contentment, and dynamic action. Teachings of International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), a Gaudiya Vaishnava religious organisation which spread rapidly in North America in the 1970s and 1980s, are based on a translation of the Gita called Bhagavad-Gītā As It Is by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.|$|E
