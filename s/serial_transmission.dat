25|$|Bit {{numbering}} is {{a concept}} similar to endianness, but on a level of bits, not bytes. Bit endianness or bit-level endianness refers to the transmission order of bits over a serial medium. The bit-level analogue of little-endian (least significant bit goes first) is used in RS-232, Ethernet, and USB. Some protocols use the opposite ordering (e.g. Teletext, I²C, SMBus, PMBus, and SONET and SDH). Usually, there exists a consistent view to the bits irrespective of their order in the byte, such that the latter becomes relevant only on a very low level. One exception {{is caused by the}} feature of some cyclic redundancy checks to detect all burst errors up to a known length, which would be spoiled if the bit order is different from the byte order on <b>serial</b> <b>transmission.</b>|$|E
25|$|When {{designing}} a device capable of computing, {{it is often}} necessary to convert parallel data lines into a serial data stream. This conversion allows different pieces of data to {{be reduced to a}} time-dependent series of values on a single wire. Figure 9 shows such a parallel-to-serial conversion QCA device. The numbers on the shaded areas represent different clocking zones at consecutive 90-degree phases. Notice how all the inputs are on the same clocking zone. If parallel data were to be driven at the inputs A, B, C and D, and then driven no more for at least the remaining 15 <b>serial</b> <b>transmission</b> phases, the output X would present the values of D, C, B and A –in that order, at phases three, seven, eleven and fifteen. If a new clocking region were to be added at the output, it could be clocked to latch a value corresponding to any of the inputs by correctly selecting an appropriate state-locking period.|$|E

50|$|João Dinis de Sousa, Viktor Müller, Philippe Lemey, and Anne-Mieke Vandamme {{proposed}} that HIV became epidemic through sexual <b>serial</b> <b>transmission,</b> in nascent colonial cities, {{helped by a}} high frequency of genital ulcers, caused by genital ulcer diseases (GUD). GUD are simply sexually transmitted diseases that cause genital ulcers; examples are syphilis, chancroid, lymphogranuloma venereum, and genital herpes. These diseases increase the probability of HIV transmission dramatically, from around 0.01-0.1% to 4-43% per heterosexual act, because the genital ulcers provide a portal of viral entry, and contain many activated T cells expressing the CCR5 co-receptor, the main cell targets of HIV.|$|E

50|$|In <b>serial</b> data <b>transmission,</b> {{de-emphasis}} has {{a different}} meaning, which {{is to reduce the}} level of all bits except the first one after a transition. That causes the high frequency content due to the transition to be emphasized compared to the low frequency content which is de-emphasized. This is a form of transmitter equalization; it compensates for losses over the channel which are larger at higher frequencies. Well known serial data standards such as PCI Express, SATA and SAS require transmitted signals to use de-emphasis.|$|R
50|$|The colonial {{authorities}} {{also gave}} many vaccinations against smallpox, and injections, of which many {{would be made}} without sterilising the equipment between uses (unsafe or unsterile injections). Chitnis et al. proposed that both these parenteral risks and the prostitution associated with forced labor camps could have caused <b>serial</b> <b>transmission</b> (or serial passage) of SIV between humans (see discussion {{of this in the}} next section). In addition, they proposed that the conditions of extreme stress associated with forced labor could depress the immune system of workers, therefore prolonging the primary acute infection period of someone newly infected by SIV, thus increasing the odds of both adaptation of the virus to humans, and of further transmissions.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} solve these {{problems}} FPD-Link which uses low-voltage differential signaling, or LVDS, were adopted into LCDs. LVDS, defined by the ANSI/TIA/EIA-644-A standard, is a differential signaling system that can run at high speed. LVDS works in serial data transmission. As the main applications had 18 bits color depth in early adoption of FPD-Link, a 7-bit wide differential cable pair for each of 3 channels with another channel for clock became used. By this adoption of FPD-Link, internal interface systems of LCDs could reduce the 22 pair cables into 8 pairs with high-speed <b>serial</b> <b>transmission.</b> The Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) adopted this as a video standard specification and FPD-Link has penetrated wider as LCD interface.|$|E

As such, the bit order of the octet access is the bit order of the accessing device, which is usually LSB 0; and <b>serial</b> <b>transmission</b> is arranged such that the least significant bit of each octet is transmitted first.
