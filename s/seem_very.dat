5|$|Ascending and {{descending}} chain {{conditions are}} general, {{meaning that they}} can be applied to many types of mathematical objects—and, on the surface, they might not <b>seem</b> <b>very</b> powerful. Noether showed how to exploit such conditions, however, to maximum advantage: for example, how to use them to show that every set of sub-objects has a maximal/minimal element or that a complex object can be generated by a smaller number of elements. These conclusions often are crucial steps in a proof.|$|E
5|$|Reductions in {{the size}} of host populations may cause a {{long-lasting}} reduction of louse taxonomic richness, for example, birds introduced into New Zealand host fewer species of lice there than in Europe. Louse sex ratios are more balanced in more social hosts and more female-biased in less social hosts, presumably due to the stronger isolation among louse subpopulations (living on separate birds) in the latter case. The extinction of a species results in the extinction of its host-specific lice. Host-switching is a random event that would <b>seem</b> <b>very</b> rarely likely to be successful, but speciation has occurred over evolutionary time-scales so it must be successfully accomplished sometimes.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, the Jakarta provincial {{government}} has consistently run {{a surplus of}} between 15–20% of total planned spending, largely because of delays in procurement procedures and other inefficiencies in the spending process. Regular underspending {{is a matter of}} frequent public comment but the legal and administrative blockages that cause the underspending problem <b>seem</b> <b>very</b> difficult to overcome.|$|E
25|$|Connections between {{languages}} can {{be traced}} because the processes that change languages are not random, but follow strict patterns. Especially sound shifts, the changing of vowels and consonants, are important, although grammar (especially morphology) and the lexicon (vocabulary) may also be significant. Historical-comparative linguistics thus {{makes it possible to}} see great similarities between languages which at first sight might <b>seem</b> <b>very</b> different.|$|E
25|$|From the {{mathematical}} point of view, {{it is possible}} to find conditions required for cooperation of several hypercycles. However, in reality, the cooperation of hypercycles would be extremely difficult, because it requires the existence of a complicated multi-step biochemical mechanism or an incorporation of more than two types of molecules. Both conditions <b>seem</b> <b>very</b> improbable; therefore, the existence of coupled hypercycles is assumed impossible in practice.|$|E

25|$|Bromeliads <b>seem</b> <b>very</b> well preadapted to carnivory, {{but only}} one or two species can be {{classified}} as truly carnivorous. By their very shape, bromeliads will benefit from increased prey-derived nutrient input. In this sense, bromeliads are probably carnivorous, but their habitats are too dark for more extreme, recognisable carnivory to evolve. Most bromeliads are epiphytes, and most epiphytes grow in partial shade on tree branches. Brocchinia reducta, on the other hand, is a ground dweller.|$|E
25|$|One time Bob Burns, the hillbilly comic, {{was on the}} show, and {{he threw}} in {{a few of his}} folksy farm stories, which of course were not in Bill Morrow's script.

We couldn't use the jokes, but Bill asked us to save the laughs. A couple of weeks later he had a show that wasn't very funny, and he insisted that we put in the salvaged laughs. Thus the laugh-track was born.|$|E
25|$|The {{linguistic}} part {{traces the}} connections between the various Indo-European languages, and reconstructs the proto-Indo-European language. This is possible because the processes that change languages are not random, but follow strict patterns. Especially sound shifts, the changing of vowels and consonants, are important, although grammar (especially morphology) and the lexicon (vocabulary) may also be significant. Historical-comparative linguistics thus {{makes it possible to}} see great similarities between languages which at first sight might <b>seem</b> <b>very</b> different. Various characteristics of the Indo-European languages argue against an Indian origin of these languages, and point to a steppe origin of these languages.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the fact}} that planets <b>seem</b> <b>very</b> common in the {{universe}} they are tiny, faint objects at cosmic scales; this makes their detection difficult with current technology. For this reason, most exoplanets have been detected with indirect methods. Of these, the most successful has been the radial velocity method. HARPS (the High Accuracy Radial-velocity Planet Searcher) has allowed {{the discovery of a}} number of planets with masses below that of Neptune orbiting nearby stars. However, few of these planets are among the smallest ever discovered, or reside in its star's habitable zone. The possibility exists that one of these planets is covered by oceans; this discovery is an encouraging result in the search for planets which could support life.|$|E
25|$|Filming for Harlow's final film Saratoga, co-starring Clark Gable, was {{scheduled}} to begin in March 1937. However, production was delayed when she developed septicemia {{and had to be}} hospitalized after a multiple wisdom tooth extraction. After she recovered, shooting began on April 22. On May 20, 1937, while shooting Saratoga, Harlow began to complain of illness. Her symptoms—fatigue, nausea, water weight and abdominal pain—did not <b>seem</b> <b>very</b> serious to her doctor, who believed she was suffering from cholecystitis and influenza. However, he was apparently unaware that Harlow had been ill during the previous year with a severe sunburn and influenza. Her friend and co-star Myrna Loy noticed Harlow's grey pallor, fatigue, and weight gain.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, Newton or New York {{remain the}} same and are not transliterated to Njuton or Njujork, transliterated forms would <b>seem</b> <b>very</b> odd to a Slovene. However, the unit of force is written as njuton as well as newton. Some {{geographical}} names are transliterated (e.g., Philadelphia – Filadelfija; Hawaii – Havaji). Other names from non-Latin languages are transliterated in a fashion {{similar to that used}} by other European languages, albeit with some adaptations. Japanese, Indian and Arabic names such as Kajibumi, Djakarta and Jabar are written as Kadžibumi, Džakarta and Džabar, where j is replaced with dž. Except for ć and đ, graphemes with diacritical marks from other foreign alphabets (e.g., ä, å, æ, ç, ë, ï, ń, ö, ß, ş, ü) are not used as independent letters.|$|E

25|$|Thereafter, the Grants {{returned}} to Italy, arriving in Rome and departed Vandalia {{where they were}} promptly approached by an emissary from Pope Leo XIII and invited to attend a ceremony with King Umberto after their visit to the Vatican. While they were visiting the Holy See Julia's cross was blessed by the Pope. During their visit to the Vatican, the Pope chatted for a while with Grant in French, while Grant's son, Jesse, translated. Among other things, the Pope expressed his regrets that religious instruction was not allowed in public schools. While in Rome, Grant visited the Colosseum, the Arch of Titus and Arch of Constantine. However, he quickly walked by Rome's famous marble statuary almost ignoring it completely and did not <b>seem</b> <b>very</b> impressed with the many paintings, much to the disappointment of Adam Badeau, who later remarked that Grant seemed blind to the beauties of art. While in Venice, Grant made remarks about the canals, noting {{that they needed to}} be cleaned.|$|E
25|$|There was no {{shortage}} of people willing to come to Texas. The United States was still struggling with {{the aftermath of the}} Panic of 1819, and soaring land prices within the United States made the Mexican land policy <b>seem</b> <b>very</b> generous. In 1827 Austin received a second grant allowing him to settle 100families along the Old San Antonio Road to Nacogdoches, near what is now Bastrop. The location was chosen {{at the behest of the}} Tejanos, who hoped that colonists in that area could help defend against Comanche raids. Austin was later granted permission to resettle 800other families in Texas. Twenty-three other empresarios also brought immigrants to Texas. Of these, only one of the empresarios, Martín De León settled citizens from within Mexico; the others came primarily from the United States. Many of the Anglo settlers owned slaves. All colonists were expected to become naturalized Mexican citizens, and they were also supposed to follow the state religion. In Austin's colony, the local priest formally converted new arrivals but then allowed them to worship as they pleased.|$|E
25|$|It {{caused him}} to reflect. But there was no result. The {{justice of the peace}} was a stern man. On the trial he found fault with the scheme and {{required}} us to explain upon what we based our strange conduct—as he called it. The understudy said:“On the custom of the niggers. They all do it.” The justice forgot his dignity and descended to sarcasm. “Custom of the niggers! Are our morals so inadequate that we have to borrow of niggers?” Then he said to the jury: “Three melons were owing; they were collected from persons not proven to owe them: this is theft; they were collected by compulsion: this is extortion. A melon was added for the widows and orphans. It was owed by no one. It is another theft, another extortion. Return it whence it came, with the others. It is not permissible here to apply to any purpose goods dishonestly obtained; not even to the feeding of widows and orphans, for this would be to put a shame upon charity and dishonor it.” He said it in open court, before everybody, and to me it did not <b>seem</b> <b>very</b> kind.|$|E
