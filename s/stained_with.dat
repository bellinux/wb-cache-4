5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} appear brown. Viewing {{them with a}} light {{microscope}} reveals finer details of their structure: they are roughly spherical but end abruptly in a small point, their surfaces are covered with small, wart-like nodules, and their size is between 5.0–5.3 by 4.0–4.7µm. The spores are in amyloid, meaning they do not absorb iodine when <b>stained</b> <b>with</b> Melzer's reagent.|$|E
5|$|The gill {{tissue is}} made of {{thin-walled}} hyphae containing a septum, which are hyaline to pale yellow, and measure 3–15µm wide. The cap tissue comprises interwoven, inflated hyphae with widths between 2 and 25µm. Neither the gill tissue nor the cap tissue show any color reaction when <b>stained</b> <b>with</b> Melzer's reagent. Clamp connections are rare in the hyphae of Lepiota babruzalka.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is {{cinnamon}} or rusty brown. The spores are elliptic, smooth-walled, nonamyloid (not absorbing iodine when <b>stained</b> <b>with</b> Melzer's reagent), and measure 6.6–8 by 3.7–4.4μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, and four-spored, with dimensions of 16–25 by 5–7μm.|$|E

40|$|The cells synthesizing {{antibodies}} {{in response}} to immunization with (3 -diazo, 5 -succinylaminobenzoyl) p-aminophenylarsenic acid—bovine gamma globulin (3 A, 5 S-BGG) and related antigens have been studied using fluorescent anti-arsanilic acid (anti-Ars), anti-m-aminosuccinanilic acid (anti-Suc) and anti-BGG antibodies, all fluorescent reagents having been prepared from specific precipitates. In the primary response, 1. 6 per cent of all cells <b>staining</b> <b>with</b> anti-hapten antibodies after treatment of the smears {{with a mixture of}} Ars-rabbit gamma globulin (Ars-RGG) and Suc-RGG <b>stain</b> <b>with</b> both (1. 9 per cent of cells <b>staining</b> <b>with</b> anti-Ars; 9. 5 per cent of cells <b>staining</b> <b>with</b> anti-Suc). In the secondary response, 12. 8 per cent of all cells <b>staining</b> <b>with</b> antihapten antibody <b>stain</b> <b>with</b> both (17. 1 per cent of cells <b>staining</b> <b>with</b> anti-Ars; 50. 6 per cent of cells <b>staining</b> <b>with</b> anti-Suc). No differences are noted in the percentages of cells <b>staining</b> <b>with</b> both anti-Ars and anti-Suc in animals given a mixture of Ars-BGG and Suc-BGG compared to animals given 3 A, 5 S-BGG or a doubly conjugated Ars-Suc-BGG (AS-BGG). Comparable numbers of doubly staining cells are present in controls given only Ars-BGG or only Suc-BGG. This is interpreted as indicating that most and probably all of the doubly staining cells noted in the experimental groups are related to an antigenic cross reaction rather than to the synthesis of two antibodies by a single cell. Evidence that this is a cross reaction of intracellular antibody is presented. No cells <b>staining</b> <b>with</b> both antihapten and anticarrier protein (BGG) antibodies have been observed...|$|R
5|$|The spores are broadly {{ellipsoid}} {{to roughly}} spherical, hyaline (translucent), smooth, and have dimensions of 9–12 by 7–8µm. They are non-amyloid, {{meaning that they}} do not absorb iodine when <b>stained</b> <b>with</b> Melzer's reagent. The spore-producing cells, the basidia, are club-shaped, measure 38–46 by 3–13µm, and have clamps at their bases.|$|E
5|$|The basidia are 15–25×3.5–5.5µm {{and have}} a slim, club-like shape. Each {{basidium}} features four sterigmata, each of which bear one spore. The spores' shape is slimly ellipsoidal or cylindrical. Their surface is smooth and their walls are thin. Although they are colourless and hyaline, the spores are amyloid, meaning they will turn bluish or purple when <b>stained</b> <b>with</b> Melzer's reagent. This characteristic differs from other very similar species, and this gave the genus its name.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of T. cruzi is diagnostic of Chagas disease. It {{can be detected}} by microscopic examination of fresh anticoagulated blood, or its buffy coat, for motile parasites; or by preparation of thin and thick blood smears <b>stained</b> <b>with</b> Giemsa, for direct visualization of parasites. Microscopically, T. cruzi can be confused with Trypanosoma rangeli, which is not known to be pathogenic in humans. Isolation of T. cruzi can occur by inoculation into mice, by culture in specialized media (for example, NNN, LIT); and by xenodiagnosis, where uninfected Reduviidae bugs are fed on the patient's blood, and their gut contents examined for parasites.|$|E

5|$|The {{spore print}} is white. The spores are elliptical, smooth, with {{dimensions}} of 8–11 by 5–7µm. They are amyloid, meaning they will absorb iodine when <b>stained</b> <b>with</b> Melzer's reagent. The spore-bearing cells (basidia) are 4-spored. Sterile cells called cystidia are numerous {{on the edges}} on the gills; they measure 33–60µm (sometimes up to 80) by 9–12µm. Cystidia that are present on the stipe (caulocystidia) appear in clusters, and clublike to irregular in shape, measuring 20–55 by 3.5–12.5µm. The gill tissue contains numerous lactifers, cells that produce the latex that is secreted when it is cut.|$|E
5|$|The spores are , smooth, {{and measure}} 7–9 by 4.5–5µm. They are {{yellowish}} when <b>stained</b> <b>with</b> Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing {{cells in the}} hymenium) are four-spored, and measure 40–54 by 6–8µm. There are no cystidia on the gill faces or edges. The cap cuticle is an ixotrichoderm—a layer of gelatinized tissue where the distal portion of the filamentous hyphae are different lengths and the hyphae themselves are arranged perpendicular to the surface; this layer of gelatinous hyphae is between 100 and 250µm thick. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} hyphae of the cuticle and the gill tissue.|$|E
5|$|The spores are 7.5–9 by 6.5–7.5µm, with an {{ellipsoid}} shape. Their surfaces are ornamented with warts and short ridges {{that do not}} form a reticulum (a network of raised net-like ridges on the surface), with ridges up to 1.0µm high. The spores are hyaline (translucent), and amyloid—they absorb iodine when <b>stained</b> <b>with</b> Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, and measure 42 by 9µm. The cap cuticle is a modified ixotrichoderm, meaning that the hyphae are embedded in a slimy or gelatinous layer.|$|E

5|$|Viewed in deposit, {{like with}} a spore print, the basidiospores of A.aestivalis are white. Examination with a {{microscope}} reveals further details: they are roughly spherical, hyaline (translucent) and thin-walled, with dimensions of 7.8–8.8µm. The spores are amyloid, {{meaning that they}} will absorb iodine when <b>stained</b> <b>with</b> Melzer's reagent and appear blue to blackish-blue. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are four-spored, thin-walled, and measure 32–60 long by 4–13µm thick. There are no clamps present at the bases of the basidia.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, such {{as with a}} spore print, {{the spores}} appear almost black, tinged with purple. The spores are spherical in shape or nearly so, smooth, thick-walled, and lack a germ pore. They are nonamyloid (not {{absorbing}} iodine when <b>stained</b> <b>with</b> Melzer's reagent), black-brown, and have dimensions of 4.5–7.5 by 5.5–6.5µm. There is a prominent scar where the spore was once attached to the basidium (the spore-bearing cell) through the sterigma. The basidia are broadly club-shaped, and mostly four-spored, with long, slender sterigmata. Unlike other Agaricus species, the spores of A.deserticola are not shot off, but are instead dispersed when they sift out of the dried, mature fruit bodies after the peridium breaks open.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, such {{as with a}} spore print, {{the spores}} of S.spraguei appear olive-brown in color, {{although}} this changes to clay or tawny-olive after drying. Microscopically, the spores have smooth surfaces, measuring 9–11 by 3–4.5µm; in side profile they have asymmetrical sides and a suprahilar depression (a surface indentation formed where the spore attaches to the basidia), while in face view they appear oblong. The spores are not amyloid, meaning {{that they do not}} absorb iodine when <b>stained</b> <b>with</b> Melzer's reagent. The basidia (the spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are thin-walled, four-spored, and have dimensions of 17–19 by 5–7.8µm. In the presence of potassium hydroxide, they appear hyaline (translucent), and they become pale yellow to nearly hyaline in Melzer's reagent.|$|E

5|$|Microscopically, poxviruses produce {{characteristic}} cytoplasmic inclusions, {{the most}} important of which are known as Guarnieri bodies, and are the sites of viral replication. Guarnieri bodies are readily identified in skin biopsies <b>stained</b> <b>with</b> hematoxylin and eosin, and appear as pink blobs. They are found in virtually all poxvirus infections but the absence of Guarnieri bodies cannot be used to rule out smallpox. The diagnosis of an orthopoxvirus infection can also be made rapidly by electron microscopic examination of pustular fluid or scabs. However, all orthopoxviruses exhibit identical brick-shaped virions by electron microscopy. However, if particles with the characteristic morphology of herpesviruses are seen this will eliminate smallpox and other orthopoxvirus infections.|$|E
5|$|Mycena galericulata {{produces}} a white spore print. The spores are , 8–10 by 5.5–7μm, and amyloid—which means they will turn blue-black to black when <b>stained</b> <b>with</b> Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) have stout sterigmata, and measure 34–40 by 7–9μm. They may be either two-spored or four-spored. There are numerous club-shaped to rounded cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge), that measure 32–40 by 8–12μm; their apices or the entire enlarged portion bear rodlike projections that become increasingly elongated and branched in age. There are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face). The gill tissue {{has a very}} thin cuticle, under which is a narrow hypoderm, while {{the remainder of the}} tissue comprises densely matted tufts of mycelia, and stains deep vinaceous-brown in iodine. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae of the four-spored forms.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 7November 1974, the children's nanny, Sandra Rivett, was bludgeoned {{to death in the}} {{basement}} of the Lucan family home. Lady Lucan was also attacked; she later identified Lucan as her assailant. As the police began their murder investigation, Lucan telephoned his mother, asking her to collect the children, and then drove a borrowed Ford Corsair to a friend's house in Uckfield, East Sussex. Hours later, he left the property and vanished without trace. The car was found abandoned in Newhaven, its interior <b>stained</b> <b>with</b> blood and its boot containing a piece of bandaged lead pipe similar to one found at the crime scene. A warrant for Lucan's arrest was issued a few days later, and in his absence the inquest into Rivett's death named him as her murderer, the last occasion in Britain a coroner's court did so.|$|E

5|$|The {{almond-shaped}} spores {{are typically}} 10–12.5 by 6–7μm with thick walls measuring between 0.5–1.2μm. They {{have a small}} central apiculus (a depressed area when the spore was once attached to the basidium via the sterigma). When mounted in distilled water, they have a coarsely warty surface and appear rusty brown in colour. When mounted in a 3% KOH solution, the spores are pale lilac grey, and the surface ornamentation forms swollen pustules that loosen and dissolve. Spores are dextrinoid (meaning they turn reddish-brown when <b>stained</b> <b>with</b> Melzer's reagent) and cyanophilic (red in acetocarmine). The basidia are club-shaped, and four-spored with sterigmata up to 9.5μm long. The ridges of the locules comprise erect cystidia mixed with chains of erect cylindrical hyphae measuring 4–6μm in diameter. The cystidia are roughly cylindrical, and have dimensions of 20–60 by 4–9μm. There are no clamp connections present in the hyphae of the fungus.|$|E
5|$|The {{forensic}} {{examination of}} the lead pipes found {{at the murder scene}} and in the Corsair's boot revealed traces of blood on the pipe from 46Lower Belgrave Street. This proved to be a mixture of Lady Lucan's (blood group A) and Sandra Rivett's (B) blood. Hair belonging to Veronica Lucan was also found on that pipe, but none belonging to Sandra Rivett. The pipe found inside the car had neither blood nor hair on it. Home Office scientists were unable to prove conclusively that both pipes were cut from the same, longer, piece of piping, although they thought it likely. The tape wrapped around both was similar, but those too could not be conclusively linked. The letters written to Bill Shand-Kydd were <b>stained</b> <b>with</b> blood considered to be from both women. The letter to Michael Stoop had no blood on it, but it was later proven that the paper it was written on had been torn from a writing pad found in the Corsair's boot.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is pale purplish brown. Spores are ovoid (egg-shaped) to {{somewhat}} ellipsoidal, binucleate (visible when <b>stained</b> <b>with</b> acetocarmine solution), often contain a single oil droplet, and measure 6–8.5 by 4–5.5µm. The spore walls are roughened with small points and ridges, {{and have a}} small plage. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 24–26 by 6–8.5µm. Cystidia on the gill face (pleurocystidia) are abundant. They are spindle-shaped with swollen middles, and thick tips that are occasionally encrusted with translucent crystals. They have dimensions of 43–86 by 10–24µm, with walls that are pale brown to translucent, and up to 3µm thick. Cystidia on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are roughly the same morphologically, but shorter. The cap cuticle comprises a layer of radially arranged gelatinized hyphae measuring 1–4µm in diameter.
