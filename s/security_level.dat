5|$|Cord and Chi {{infiltrate}} Nagarov's base {{to destroy}} the Super Computer. On {{the roof of a}} large tower, Cord destroys a building with a surface-to-air missile launcher to create a diversion. When he meets with Chi again, she is being threatened by Kostov, who thinks she has betrayed his men. Chi kills Kostov before he can pull the trigger. With Chi's help, Cord uses an elevator to go {{to the top of the}} tower and he activates a cable car leading to an island. Cord explores the docking area, and he finds Alexandria in a cell on the <b>security</b> <b>level.</b> Cord uses the main elevator in the complex to access the other levels. Cord creates a diversion and enters level 1, where he inserts the explosive charge into the Super Computer. A cut scene is shown that reveals that Alpha has betrayed him. In a transmission, she tells that premier Nagarov had to be certain that Cord was not acting on her orders when he attacked the refinery. She assured Nagarov that Cord had not entered the facility, but Nagarov had a recording of Cord in the refinery. It resulted in a simple policy shift and the British are now working with the Volgians. As the reactor becomes critical, Nagarov and Lukyan leave the room. Until this moment, the game has taken place in Cord's memory, as he was interrogated by Nagarov after being captured, but from this point on it takes place in real time.|$|E
5|$|The {{firewall}} scans for Internet-enabled {{applications and}} creates access rules {{based on a}} knowledge base maintained by Symantec during installation. In PC Magazine testing, the installation took 24 minutes to complete on a 750MHz Pentium III with 92 Internet-enabled applications. Using the firewall, users can determine whether to accept cookies, Java applets, and ActiveX controls on a global or per-site basis. A new feature, Intrusion Detection with AutoBlock, can detect port scans and block further intrusion attempts. The program provides notifications for intrusion attempts, stating the severity level and providing access to threat details. Alternatively, the firewall can put the computer in stealth, essentially hiding the system. Users can configure the <b>security</b> <b>level,</b> affecting the number of notifications. Testing conducted by PC Magazine using Shields Up and Symantec's Security Check found that the firewall successfully stealthed all ports, hiding the computer from view. A leak test was conducted to see the firewall's ability to detect outbound connections. Each attempt was detected and the suite offered to block the attempts.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an extension to a Multi-Level Secure (MLS) data model {{that requires the}} classification of data and users into multiple <b>security</b> <b>levels.</b> In MLS systems, cover stories allow information provided to users at lower <b>security</b> <b>levels</b> to differ from information provided to users at higher <b>security</b> <b>levels.</b> Previous versions of the MLS model did not permit cover stories for key attributes, because the key is used to relate the various cover stories for a particular entity. We have extended the MLS model to include non-key related cover stories so that key attributes can also have different values at different <b>security</b> <b>levels.</b> In this paper we describe the necessary model changes and modifications to the relational algebra, which are required to implement non-key related cover stories. We demonstrate the improvements made by these changes and discuss the implementation and performance of a system based on the described concepts...|$|R

The Strong Star Property is usually discussed in the context of multilevel database management systems and is motivated by integrity concerns. This Strong Star Property was anticipated in the Biba model where it was shown that strong integrity in combination with the Bell–LaPadula model resulted in reading and writing at a single level.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to pre-entry security checks, all MDP officers {{are required to}} hold at least UK Government Security Check (SC) clearance (which clears the holder to UK Secret level). All Nuclear Division officers, and about 30% of all other officers, are required to hold Developed Vetting (DV) status which involves an intrusive background investigation and formal interviews. DV status clears the officer to UK Top Secret level. Not all officers pass the DV process; such officers are then employed at SC <b>security</b> <b>level</b> within the force.|$|E

SKM is {{systematically}} working on improving the quality of stops, as most of them are currently in bad shape, lacking basic services such as elevators for handicapped passengers or proper ticket validators. The company recently launched a survey, asking visitors to its website which of the stops should be repaired first. Since January 2006 SKM decided to install video cameras at stops and stations in order to improve the <b>security</b> <b>level</b> on platforms and inside station buildings.|$|E

25|$|Generally, when {{an inmate}} {{arrives at a}} prison, they go through a {{security}} classification screening and risk assessment that determines {{where they will be}} placed within the prison system. Classifications are assigned by assessing the prisoner's personal history and criminal record, and through subjective determinations made by intake personnel (which include mental health workers, counselors, prison unit managers, and others). This process will {{have a major impact on}} the prisoner's experience, determining their <b>security</b> <b>level,</b> educational and work programs, mental health status (e.g. will they be placed in a mental health unit), and many other factors. This sorting of prisoners is one of the fundamental techniques through which the prison administration maintains control over the inmate population, and creates an orderly and secure prison environment. At most prisons, prisoners are made to wear prison uniform.|$|E
25|$|Kernel-mode {{rootkits}} {{run with}} the highest operating system privileges (Ring 0) by adding code or replacing portions of the core operating system, including both the kernel and associated device drivers. Most operating systems support kernel-mode device drivers, which execute with the same privileges as the operating system itself. As such, many kernel-mode rootkits are developed as device drivers or loadable modules, such as loadable kernel modules in Linux or device drivers in Microsoft Windows. This class of rootkit has unrestricted security access, but {{is more difficult to}} write. The complexity makes bugs common, and any bugs in code operating at the kernel level may seriously impact system stability, leading to discovery of the rootkit. One of the first widely known kernel rootkits was developed for Windows NT 4.0 and released in Phrack magazine in 1999 by Greg Hoglund. Kernel rootkits can be especially difficult to detect and remove because they operate at the same <b>security</b> <b>level</b> as the operating system itself, and are thus able to intercept or subvert the most trusted operating system operations. Any software, such as antivirus software, running on the compromised system is equally vulnerable. In this situation, no part of the system can be trusted.|$|E

Other exterior features include structural elements left exposed along with portions of the curved metal skin that extend out from the building. Mayne, the building's architect, stated that it was [...] "the language of the ribbon" [...] to describe the exterior design.|$|E
