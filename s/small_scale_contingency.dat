40|$|The {{interest}} {{in the development and}} restructuring of the New Zealand economy with increasing emphasis upon industrial development has seen the emergence of what has been termed the 'Small Scale High Value' concept. The dichotomy of firms which are <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> and producing high unit value products would seem appropriate to the New Zealand economy which is characterised by smallness. Two major considerations are involved. First there is the conceptual problem of <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> firms. This necessitates the evaluation of the <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> concept and the recognition of the main characteristics and advantages of <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> operations. This evaluation builds a conceptual framework within which <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> firms in New Zealand can be assessed and their contribution and potential contribution to the New Zealand economy placed in perspective. This raises the second major focus, that of an empirical study identifying and examining <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> firms within the New Zealand context. The need is to ascertain the contribution of the <b>Small</b> <b>Scale</b> High Value firms to the New Zealand economy {{and the extent to which}} government or industrial policy should be directed to their assistance. A number of authors have promoted <b>Small</b> <b>Scale</b> High Value firms as worthy of special attention due to their characteristics and advantages being suitable to the structural development and growth of the national economy.

It has been argued that the formal definition does not capture all the intricacies of <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> mining. The definition {{does not take into account}} the level of technology deployed, production output, nature and motivation of miners etc. The objectives of the research conducted were to firstly develop a formal and scientific definition for <b>Small</b> <b>Scale</b> Mining in South Africa and secondly to use and apply Engineering Management concepts to optimise and improve the productivity of selected <b>Small</b> <b>Scale</b> Mining and Minerals Processing operations in South Africa. The methodology used involved conducting a literature review of the types of <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> mining and mineral processing operations that exist within South Africa. A case study approach was used and a questionnaire was developed to gather information from selected legal <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> mining and processing operations in South Africa. A survey was developed and submitted to experts/specialists in the field of <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> mining in order to use the Pairwise Comparison Decision Making Tool to develop a scientific definition of <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> mining. By comparing the information studied in the literature with the data obtained from visiting two <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> operations (semi-precious gemstones and diamonds) and using engineering management concepts it was found that the recommended improvements that one can make to <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> mining and minerals processing operations in South Africa can essentially be categorised into four critical areas namely: Management, Chemical Analysis, Technology and Skills.

40|$|In the Highway {{construction}} project development process, State Highway Agencies (SHA) prepare cost estimates for effective communication to stakeholders and for project cost control. Cost estimates prepared {{in the planning}} phase of project development typically in a time range of 10 to 20 years from project letting are characterized by {{a great deal of}} uncertainty due to low scope definition. SHAs typically include an amount as contingency in the project cost estimate to cover costs due to unidentified or unquantified risks during project development. However, most of the methods used by SHAs to apply contingency to projects lack consistency in definition and application. This leads to poor communication to stakeholders, project cost escalation and other project control issues due to inaccuracy of baseline cost estimates. This study developed a set of sliding <b>scale</b> <b>contingencies</b> for estimating contingency on highway projects taking into consideration the effect of major factors, such as project complexity that impacts contingency application. Expert opinion was sought through the use of the Delphi technique. Experimental techniques were not suitable for this study due to the exploratory nature of the problem and the lack of data to analyze using empirical methods. The Delphi method typically consists of a series of rounds called questionnaires. Twenty-three professionals with experience in risk assessment and cost estimating {{agreed to participate in the}} study. Email was the means of communication using an excel spreadsheet. The assessment was completed in three iterative rounds with controlled feedback to the participants on the panel at the end of each round.

Below this height, <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> structures are associated with (and occur earlier than) maxima in the large scale velocity. Above this height, while the lag is similar in magnitude, the <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> structures are associated with minima in the large scale velocity.

Study Design: A cross-section survey of 167 <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> farmers was carried out to estimate {{the impact of}} pesticide regulations on farm performance. A structured interview was used to obtain descriptive information in the field. Place and Duration of Study: Data collection for the study took place between January and April 2016 in the selected <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> vegetable farms in Mvomero and Kilosa districts in Morogoro region, Tanzania. Methodology: The Hirschman’s framework {{was used to examine}} the strategic options through which <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> vegetable farmers respond to the private and public pesticide standards focusing on whether the strategy is loyalty, voice, exit and neglect. The logistic regression was used to estimate the impact of loyalty and exit strategies on the income and pesticide expenditure of <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> vegetable farmers. The instrument variable was used to account for endogeneity problem in regression function of pesticide use. Results: About, 80 % of the <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> vegetable farmers responded to pesticide regulations through “loyalty and exit” while 20 % of the farmers deployed “neglect” option with no voice response. The regression results revealed that the loyalty and exit strategies are significantly but positively and negatively associated with pesticide expenditure and income of <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> vegetable farmers respectively. The <b>small</b> <b>scale</b> vegetable farmers who opted for loyalty and exit strategies not only have an increased amount spent on pesticides but also earn less income from vegetable production than those with a neglect strategic response.

A simple power-law distribution is used to model the variation of material property graded in the thickness direction. The dimensionless partial differential equation of motion is derived by using Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, von-Karman geometric nonlinearity and Eringen’s nonlocal elasticity theory. Using multiple scale method, one can find the governing equations of steady state response of functionally graded nano-beams excited by distributed harmonic force.
