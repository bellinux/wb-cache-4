He was a star at Crystal City High School, where he scored 3,068 points in his scholastic career, was twice named All-American, and was elected to the Missouri Association of Student Councils. He received 75 college scholarship offers, although he applied to only five schools and only scored a 485 out of 800 on the Verbal portion of the SAT, which—despite being likely in the top third of all test takers that year—normally would have caused selective <b>schools</b> <b>like</b> Princeton University to reject him.|$|E
5|$|Carlisle {{dominated}} {{the next two}} years, with the 1912 and 1913 teams losing only one game each. Warner's salary increased to $4,500 (approximately $107,000 in 2016) per season. In 1914 there was an administrative change in Washington, with federal money considered better spent in the Midwest than on <b>schools</b> <b>like</b> Carlisle. Many students left, and this affected the team (which had a 5–10–1 record). After that season, Warner left Carlisle to become head coach at Pittsburgh.|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the relations among children’s effortful control, <b>school</b> <b>liking,</b> and academic competence {{with a sample}} of 240 7 - to 12 -year-old children. Parents and children reported on effortful control, and teachers and children assessed <b>school</b> <b>liking.</b> Children, parents, and teachers reported on children’s academic competence. Significant positive correlations existed between children’s effortful control, <b>school</b> <b>liking,</b> and academic competence. Consistent with predictions, and while controlling for the effects of parents’ education and family income, <b>school</b> <b>liking</b> mediated the relation between effortful control and academic competence. Implications include a focus on proximal processes such as enhancing <b>school</b> <b>liking</b> and encouraging social relationships when designing interventions to promote academic competence...|$|R
40|$|Findings {{about the}} {{association}} between academic performance and <b>school</b> <b>liking</b> have been inconsistent, indicating that this association may depend on other factors. Because of this, {{it is important to}} try and identify factors that can moderate this association. Under which conditions do adolescents with learning difficulties still <b>like</b> <b>school,</b> or under which conditions do they dislike school the most? The current study examines the relationship between learning difficulties and the general <b>liking</b> of <b>school,</b> as well as potential moderators of this association: self-esteem among peers and the perception of class climate. The current study uses the data of a Finnish study, consisting of 11, 365 adolescents averaging 14. 75 year of age. The effects of learning difficulties on <b>school</b> <b>liking</b> were researched, as well as the interaction effects of self-esteem and perception of classroom climate. This analysis showed that learning difficulties are a negative predictor of <b>school</b> <b>liking.</b> However, the negative effects of learning difficulties on <b>school</b> <b>liking</b> are significantly moderated by self-esteem among peers. Adolescents with high self-esteem have higher <b>school</b> <b>liking</b> than adolescents with low self-esteem. Both groups <b>like</b> <b>school</b> less when encountering learning difficulties, but the drop in <b>school</b> <b>liking</b> is significantly greater for adolescents with high self-esteem. Additionally, a more positive perception of class climate does moderate the negative effects of learning difficulties on <b>school</b> <b>liking.</b> Adolescents with a more positive perception of their classroom climate have higher <b>school</b> <b>liking</b> and experience a significantly smaller drop in <b>school</b> <b>liking</b> when they encounter learning difficulties...|$|R
40|$|As {{children}} enter kindergarten, {{the degree}} to which they <b>like</b> <b>school</b> may be an important determinant of their classroom participation, which in turn may impact their achievement. To explore this premise, data were gathered on <b>school</b> <b>liking,</b> classroom participation, and achievement with a sample of 200 children (M age = 5. 58) as they entered and completed kindergarten. Greater support was found for the premise that <b>school</b> <b>liking</b> fosters classroom participation and achievement than for the contention that early participation and achievement increases <b>school</b> <b>liking</b> or identification. Also supported was the premise that children’s early academic progress stems from affective processes (e. g., <b>liking</b> <b>school)</b> that are distinct from many other entry factors (e. g., family backgrounds, formative experiences, child’s readiness, etc.) ...|$|R
5|$|As {{with the}} curriculum, {{there are no}} {{references}} to sports being played at Carre's before the 19th century. In 1835, the Marquis of Bristol allowed the school to use an acre of land, which probably functioned as a playground. Sports fields were not added to the grounds until 1908, but the earliest reports of the school participating in sporting events pre-date this by half a century. In the 1860s, the Sleaford Gazette reported on cricket matches with local schools, namely the rival academies run by Mr Boyer and Mr Dibben in Sleaford; by the 1890s, these matches were being organised with more distant <b>schools,</b> <b>like</b> the grammar school at Grantham. Athletics were practised at the school as early as 1871 when a sports day was held; the 100 yards and half a mile races, hurdles, the pole jump and throwing the cricket ball were activities in which forms competed. Football was played at the school as early as 1895. Glebe land was acquired in 1908 for sporting purposes and levelled in the early 1930s. A cycling club was formed in the 1940s and badminton was informally organised by pupils by the 1950s; between 1957 and 1960, a portion of land was converted into tennis courts for the school and rugby {{was introduced in the}} 1966–67 academic year.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of the American Catholic parochial school system {{can be divided into}} three phases. During the first (1750–1870), parochial schools appeared as ad hoc efforts by parishes, and most Catholic children attended public schools. During the second period (1870–1910), the Catholic hierarchy made a basic commitment to a separate Catholic school system. These parochial <b>schools,</b> <b>like</b> the big-city parishes around them, tended to be ethnically homogeneous; a German child would not be sent to an Irish school, nor vice versa, nor a Lithuanian pupil to either. Instruction {{in the language of the}} old country was common. In the third period (1910–1945), Catholic education was modernized and modeled after the public school systems, and ethnicity was deemphasized in many areas. In cities with large Catholic populations (such as Chicago and Boston) there was a flow of teachers, administrators, and students from one system to the other.|$|E

25|$|Infanta Beatriz {{was educated}} {{within the walls}} of the Palacio de Oriente by English nannies. She learned English and French along with Spanish. The {{children}} spoke in English to their mother and Spanish to their father. Infanta Beatriz and her sister Maria Cristina, two years her junior, yearned to go to private <b>schools</b> <b>like</b> the daughters of the nobility who frequented the palace as their playmates, but, following Spanish tradition, they were educated by governesses and privates tutors. They studied languages, history, religion and took piano and dancing lessons. Their parents placed great importance on outdoor exercise and Infanta Beatriz became fond of sports. She was a very good swimmer, played tennis and golf and loved horseback riding. While in Madrid she played in the palace gardens and made excursions on horseback. In summer the royal family moved to Palacio de la Magdalena, near Santander, where they practiced water sports. The two sisters also made some visits to England to stay with their maternal grandmother at Kensington Palace.|$|E
25|$|The {{first big}} city to aggressively promote {{the use of}} Norplant was Baltimore. Baltimore {{targeted}} teenagers because the birthrate was three times higher than other states. In Baltimore, about ten percent of girls between ages 15 and 17 gave birth during 1990. Young mothers would often {{drop out of school}} and struggle to raise the child in poverty. The mayor at the time, Kurt Schmoke, pushed for laws that would give teen girls more access to Norplant. Norplant was eventually given to teen girls at schools without parental consent. Programs were designed for, and performed in, predominantly black schools. Laurence G. Paquin Middle School became the first school to provide Norplant to their students. Paquin Middle School had 355 female students but only 5 of them were not black. Their program started off as a pilot program and soon other urban high <b>schools</b> <b>like</b> San Fernando High School in Los Angeles and Crane High School in Chicago’s West Side adopted the program of providing Norplant to their students. Because of a focus on predominantly black schools, questions of racism arose amongst black community leaders.|$|E
25|$|In {{selective}} schools, various languages may {{be offered}} as electives {{like in a}} SPFL program, {{as well as other}} subjects such as computer programming and literary writing like in STEM schools or Laboratory High Schools. Chinese schools have language and cultural electives. International Schools offers electives or subjects like writing, culture, history, language, art, or a special subject unique to the school. Preparatory <b>schools</b> <b>like</b> technical vocational schools or schools with TVL Program usually add some business, entrepreneurship, and accountancy courses. Special science high <b>schools</b> <b>like</b> those of PSHS System (administered by DOST) and RSHS System (administered by DepEd) have biology, chemistry, and physics at every level and or exclusive and advanced science and math subjects as well as subjects in technology, pre-engineering, and research. These science schools are more exclusive and with higher standards compared to general high school's STEM Program. PSHS or RSHS students may transfer to a STEM program school but not the way around. PSHS students may also transfer to a RSHS and vice versa only for incoming sophomore year. Both PSHS and RSHS students must maintain an average grade especially in their advanced sciences and math subjects on a quarterly basis or else will lose the chance of continuing education in these schools, therefore, will make students transfer to a STEM Program school or a general high school. This systems makes sure the quality and exclusiveness of science high schools. In special government-run art school such as Philippine High School for the Arts, which is administered by the Cultural Center of the Philippines in coordination with Department of Education, and as well as the National Commission for Culture and the Arts offers a much specialized and exclusive curricular program than general high school's SPA Program. Like the PSHS and RSHS to STEM schools system, students from PHSA should maintain grades in their art field of specialization or will transfer to an SPA school or a general high school. But SPA students can enroll in PHSA only for incoming sophomores passing exclusive test, auditions, and interviews, and not from general high schools but from SPA school only. Both schools of Philippine Science High School System and the Philippine High School for the Arts are administered by government agencies apart from DepEd but still is in coordination with it. These schools offers scholarship for students with high aptitude and talents in science fields or the art fields granting those who passes rigorous and exclusive tests with many special benefits like free board and lodging, free books, a monthly stipend, and classes taught by experts, masters, and active practitioners of their respective fields among others.|$|E
