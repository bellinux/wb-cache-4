The WIRE spacecraft, the fifth in the series of NASA Small Explorer (SMEX) spacecraft, is currently scheduled for launch in September 1998. WIRE is a momentum-biased, three-axis stabilized stellar pointer which must meet a radial pointing stability requirement of 6 arcsecond. The spacecraft will slew to a new target 8 to 10 times per orbit, and perform small (approximately 1 arc-minute) offset maneuvers every 48 seconds while on a target. As a means of providing the most science for the cost, the third SMEX spacecraft {{was used as the}} baseline {{in the development of the}} WIRE ACS subsystem. Key drivers forcing modifications to this design are the short mission duration and the instrument sun and earth avoidance constraints. The WIRE attitude control system implements a hierarchy of modes where the 2 ̆ 2 higher 2 ̆ 2 modes are of increasing complexity and accuracy. These ACS modes are utilized in conjunction with fault detection and handling logic to autonomously insure the safety of the instrument and spacecraft.

40|$|With {{incidents}} of stroke becoming increasingly frequent, finding new means of providing {{more efficient and}} effective rehabilitation has become a rapidly growing area of research. While much of the focus has been directed towards robot-based methods, mechanically passive methods capable of providing similar therapeutic benefits in a less expensive and <b>safer</b> <b>package</b> are also being explored. Such devices are more practical for wide-spread use, both in a clinical setting {{as well as for}} in-home therapy. This thesis developed a mechanically passive device for neuromuscular rehabilitation after stroke called WRIST (Wrist Resonator for Independent Stroke Training). WRIST incorporates a tone-canceling linkage designed to counteract intrinsic wrist stiffness to ease movement, as well as an appropriately designed mass and superimposed spring stiffness to create a resonant environment that the user can take advantage of to facilitate repetitive wrist flexion and extension. As a proof of concept, a pilot study with two, chronic, severely-impaired stroke subjects was conducted to verify benefits of the linkage and resonant system. The torque profiles of each subject's wrist, as well as the residual wrist torque with the linkage engaged were measured and verified that the linkage accurately cancelled the intrinsic wrist stiffness. Moreover, the tone-canceling linkage increased active range of motion of the wrist, and superimposing the resonant system further increased it. These results support the idea that appropriately-designed, mechanically passive devices have the potential to provide therapeutic benefits similar to that of robotic rehabilitation devices...|$|R

Clones that produced high levels of reverse transcriptase and env protein were tested {{for their ability to}} package the replication-defective retrovirus vectors delta neo and N 2. One of the gag-pol and env clones (GP+E- 86) was able to transfer G 418 resistance to recipient cells at a titer of as high as 1. 7 X 10 (5) when it was used to package delta neo and as high as 4 X 10 (6) when it was used to package N 2.

40|$|Plastics are {{well-established}} for {{convenient and}} <b>safe</b> <b>packaging</b> {{and distribution of}} food and feed goods. At present, this special sector of the plastic market displays remarkably increasing quantities of its annual production. Caused by the ongoing limitation and strongly fluctuating prices of fossil feedstocks, classically used for plastic production, there is an evident trend to switch towards so-called “bio-plastics”. Especially for bulk applications such as food packaging, a broad implementation of “bio-plastics” constitutes a future-oriented strategy to restrict the dependence of global industry on fossil feedstocks, and to diminish current problematic environmental issues arising from plastic disposal. However, food packaging demands {{a great deal of}} the utilized packaging material. This encompasses tailored mechanical properties such as low brittleness and adequate tensile strength, a sufficient barrier for oxygen, CO 2, and aromatic flavors, high UV-resistance, and high water retention-capacity to block the food´s moisture content, or to prevent humidity, respectively. Due to their hydrophobic character and the broad flexibility of their mechanical features, prokaryotic poly(hydroxyalkanoates) (PHAs) are considered as promising materials to compete with petro-plastics on the food-packaging market. Nevertheless, short-comings in particular aspects of their material performance and economics of their biosynthesis and purification constitute stumbling blocks on the long way towards broad implementation of PHAs for food packaging. This article discusses advantages and drawbacks of PHAs as food packaging materials, and demonstrates how desired properties can be improved by the designing of novel composite materials, and also encompassing techniques by applying nanoparticles...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{identify}} {{child or}} family related {{risk factors for}} unintentional childhood poisoning in Greece and to explore whether product specific poisonings might have special features that make them amenable to preventive interventions. SETTING: A case-control study was undertaken in Athens, Greece in 1995. Cases were 100 consecutive children brought with poisoning to the emergency clinics of the two university affiliated children's hospitals. For every case two age, gender, and hospital matched controls were chosen from among children brought to the outpatient clinics of these hospitals on the same date. METHODS: All children and their guardians were interviewed by the same person using a standard questionnaire that covered demographic, socioeconomic, behavioral, and past injury characteristics. Information was also obtained concerning type and conditions of poisoning for cases. Statistical analysis was undertaken by modeling the data using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Socioeconomic factors were not important risk indicators in these data but children living with other than both parents were at increased risk (odds ratio (OR) = 4. 7, p = 0. 08), as were children {{with a history of}} previous poisoning that required medical care (OR = 5. 1, p = 0. 05). Unintentional poisonings caused by chewing or swallowing cigarettes were concentrated in families where both parents were smokers. CONCLUSIONS: Absence of a parent appears to be associated with increased likelihood of childhood poisoning. The importance of product accessibility is underlined by the concentration of tobacco poisoning among children of parents who were both smokers. In the cultural context of this study, sociodemographic factors do not appear to represent demonstrable risk factors. Instead, control of childhood poisoning should be concentrated on <b>safe</b> <b>packaging,</b> storage, and disposal of potentially hazardous products...|$|E

Initially the threshold pile height was sought applying decreasing compression stresses equivalent to pile loads of 160, 120 and 80 cm, with four replicates in four hour assays. The safe threshold pile height which protects the products against cracking rupture in these three commodities were of 80 cm. In a complementary study, plastic and elastic deformations induced by this safe pile threshold height were measured. The irreversible deformation, plastic deformation component, were lower in bell pepper (3. 8 %), medium in lettuce (4. 23 %) and had the higher values in collard greens (10. 2 %). The reversible deformations, the elastic component, was also the lower in bell pepper (4. 14 %), medium in lettuce (7. 41 %) and the higher in collard greens (8. 17 %). Considering these modest plastic deformations, the safe pile threshold heights were accepted and the <b>safe</b> <b>package</b> heights were defined as the pile threshold height multiplied {{by a factor of}} 0. 5. This safety factor incorporates protection against accelerations of impact and vibration which occur during handling and transportation, as it was previously used for the development of packages for compact fruits and vegetables with higher apparent density.

More recently, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issued a final rule on Part 71 via emergency rule-making procedures in order to address an identified deficiency related to one of the fissile exemptions. To address the specified deficiency in a general fashion, the emergency rule adopted the approach of the 1996 Edition of the IAEA: Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material (IAEA 1996), which places restrictions on certain moderating materials and limits the quantity of fissile material in a consignment. The public comments received by the NRC indicated general agreement with the need for restrictions on certain moderators (beryllium, deuterium, and graphite). The comments indicated concern relative to both the degree of restriction imposed (not more than 0. 1 % of fissile material mass) and the need to limit the fissile material mass of the consignment, particularly in light of the subsequent NRC staff position that the true intent was to provide control for limiting the fissile mass of the conveyance.

Eggs were collected from commercial cage and free-range flocks at the ages of 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, and 75 wk. From each collection per flock, 30 eggs were processed for the eggshell and egg internal quality determination, 30 eggs for cuticle estimation, 30 eggs for mammillary layer ultrastructural features scoring, and 60 eggs for egg microbial enumeration. Translucency score and shell reflectivity were significantly higher in free-range eggs and increased with flock age in both production systems. Egg weight, shell weight, percentage shell, shell thickness, albumen height, Haugh unit, and yolk color were higher for cage eggs. The amount of cuticle was higher in cage eggs and fluctuated with flock age in both production systems. For the mammillary layer ultrastructural variables, a significant effect of production system and flock age was observed for early fusion, Type A bodies, and Type B bodies, whereas aragonite, depression, erosion, and hole were rarely observed. Variability of mammillary cap size, the incidence of poor mammillary cap quality, incidence of late fusion, alignment, Type A bodies, Type B bodies, and cubic cone formation were greater in the free-range versus cage system and increased with flock age in both production systems. The incidence of confluence and early fusion were greater in cage eggs and decreased with age in both production systems. Significantly lower total microbial load was observed for cage compared with free-range eggs, but the overall bacterial load recorded in this study was low. It can be concluded that cage eggs were better in overall quality when directly compared with free-range eggs. Samiullah, J. R. Roberts, and K. K. Chousalka...|$|E
40|$|The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Regulations for the <b>safe</b> <b>packaging</b> and {{transportation}} of radioactive materials follow a graded {{approach to the}} requirements for both packaging and controls during transport. The concept is that, the lower the risk posed {{to the people and}} the environment by the contents, (1) the less demanding are the packaging requirements and (2) the smaller in number are the controls imposed on the transport of the material. There are likely to be a great number of situations arising in coming years when large objects, contaminated with radioactive material having unlimited A{sub 2 } values will result from various decommissioning and decontamination (D and D) activities and will then require shipment from the D and D site to a disposal site. Such situations may arise relatively frequently during the cleanup of operations involving mining, milling, feedstock, and uranium enrichment processing facilities. Because these objects are contaminated with materials having an unlimited A{sub 2 } value they present a low radiological risk to worker and public safety and to the environment during transport. However, when these radioactive materials reside on the surfaces of equipment and other large objects, where the equipment and objects themselves are not radioactive, the radioactive materials appear as surface contamination and, if the contaminated object is categorized as a surface contaminated object, it would need to be packaged for shipment according to the requirements of the Regulations for SCO. Despite this categorization, alternatives may be available which will allow these contaminants, when considered by themselves for packaging and transport, to be categorized as either (1) a limited quantity of radioactive material to be shipped in an excepted package or (2) low specific activity (LSA) materials to be shipped in an IP- 1 package or possibly even shipped unpackaged.

40|$|Adenoviral vectors can {{efficiently}} transduce a broad {{variety of}} different cell types and have been used extensively in preclinical and clinical studies. However, early generation of adenoviral vectors retained residual adenoviral genes that contribute to inflammatory immune responses and toxicity. In addition, these vectors often result in transient expression of the potentially therapeutic transgene. Some clinical trials based on early generation adenoviral vectors have been discontinued because of acute inflammatory responses and toxicity and even one patient has died as {{a direct consequence of}} adenoviral toxicity. The latest generation of high-capacity adenoviral vectors is devoid of viral genes, and is having a significantly improved safety profile and yielding more prolonged transgene expression compared to early generation vectors. Nevertheless, transgene expression gradually declines even when high-capacity adenoviral vectors are used, possibly due to the gradual loss of vector genomes. Despite their improved safety, high-capacity adenoviral vectors can still trigger transient toxic effects in animals and patients. Restricting the tropism of adenoviral vectors by immunologic or genetic re-targeting may further improve their therapeutic window. The safety of adenoviral vectors has been improved further through the development of <b>safer</b> <b>packaging</b> systems that eliminate the homologous overlap between vector and helper sequences and therefore prevent formation of replication-competent adenoviruses (RCA). RCA could exacerbate inflammatory responses and act as a helper to rescue adenoviral vectors, potentially increasing the effective vector dose. Conditionally replicating adenoviruses (CRAds) have been developed for cancer gene therapy, which replicate selectively in some cancer cells. The use of CRAds in combination with chemotherapy yielded therapeutic effects in patients suffering from cancer but dose-limiting toxicity was apparent. Although {{there appears to be a}} very low theoretical risk of malignancy that is predominantly associated with the occurrence of E 1 -positive recombinants, no malignancies have been reported that were associated with adenoviral vectors. Nevertheless, integrating adenoviral vectors carry a greater malignancy risk due to their ability to integrate randomly into the target genomes. status: publishe...|$|R

The original and treated films are simultaneously {{exposed to the}} vapor from hot water. The latter keeps its optical clarity because the condensed water formed a thin film on it instead of droplets for the former. Compared with the widely used coating method, plasma treatment to obtain anti-fog polymer film {{has the potential for}} mass production, lower cost, better compatibility with thermal extrusion process, and <b>safer</b> for food <b>packaging.</b> It can also be employed to improve the visualization of microfluidic reactors under high relative humidity...|$|R
40|$|In February 1995, the US Department of Energy (DOE) {{approved}} the Spent Nuclear Fuel (SNF) Project's ''Path Forward'' recommendation for {{resolution of the}} safety and environmental concerns associated with the deteriorating SNF stored in the Hanford Site's K Basins (Hansen 1995). The recommendation included an aggressive series of projects to design, construct, and operate systems and facilitates to permit the <b>safe</b> retrieval, <b>packaging,</b> transport, conditions, and interim storage of the K Basins' SNF. The facilities are the Cold VAcuum Drying Facility (CVDF) in the 100 K Area of the Hanford Site and the Canister Storage building (CSB) in the 200 East Area. The K Basins' SNF is to be cleaned, repackaged in multi-canister overpacks (MCOs), removed from the K Basins, and transported to the CVDF for initial drying. The MCOs would then be moved to the CSB and weld sealed (Loscoe 1996) for interim storage (about 40 years). One of the major tasks associated with the initial Path Forward activities is the development and maintenance of the safety documentation. In addition to meeting the construction needs for new structures, the safety documentation for each must be generated...|$|R
