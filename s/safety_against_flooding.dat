The flood flow characteristic parameters including drag coefficient, scouring and vortex shedding are built into a pier-flood interaction model to investigate structural <b>safety</b> <b>against</b> <b>flood</b> hazards considering the effects of local scouring, hydrodynamic forces, and vortex induced resonance vibrations. By extracting the pier-flood simulation results embedded in a neural networks code, two cases of pier toppling occurred in typhoon days were reexamined: (1) a bridge overcome by flash flood near a mountain side; (2) a bridge washed off in flood across a wide channel near the estuary. The modeling procedures and simulations are capable of identifying the probable causes for the tumbled bridge piers during heavy floods, which include the excessive pier bending moments and resonance in structural vibrations.

The objective of this paper is to economical analyze flood damage in various regions of the world. The paper was developed based on data from secondary sources from the European Environment Agency and the Ministry of Environment of the Slovak republic. One single event may produce both benefits and losses to different parts of the riverine ecosystem and the impact on the economy of the State. These impacts are extremely difficult to quantify or monetize e. g. by quantifying ecosystem services before and after an event or accounting for the number of fish killed or trees damaged. If more people are to dwell in vulnerable areas and more and more businesses settle down in these areas the more intensive effect a flood event will have upon society and the world economy.

The thesis discusses: - a generic probabilistic design framework for assessing flood defence systems; - statistical techniques in establishing a probabilistic hydraulic boundary conditions regarding to the extreme environmental hydraulic load variables. - safety assessment and reliability based design in answering the questions of e. g how safe is the system; where is the weakest link {{of the system and}} how can be improved the safety of the system in order to meet a pre-defined target <b>safety</b> <b>against</b> <b>floods.</b> - risk assessment and evaluation frameworks for low-lying flood prone regions taking into account region/country specific characteristics, such as social economic development, local attitude towards flood risk etc. The proposed approaches can be further developed to apply to various common problems in civil engineering design. Applying these modern approaches in the same fields in developing countries, where the safety of the actual flood defences are relatively low and safety regulations are not well defined, is still limited and therefore promoted. These approaches have been tested for a case study of coastal flood defences in Vietnam. It has been proved that the specific reliability and risk based models developed in this study can be applied adequately to these situations in developing countries.

Wastewater treatment schemes were implemented to alleviate this problem. Today, among urban drainage engineers the concept still prevails that "receiving water protection is equal to pollution discharge reduction". While the engineer traditionally focuses on water quality and its improvement, biologists claim that the ecological quality of a receiving water is determined by numerous factors of which many are only poorly understood.

40|$|The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) is a {{governmental}} body, which, i. e., seeks to improve society's {{ability to deal}} with floods and landslides. The NVE is required by the national government and the Norwegian parliament to prioritise flood defences and landslide damage in those situations considered of highest risk. At the same time, the NVE should also prioritise safety measures with reference to cost-effectiveness. Within the NVE, prioritising safety measures with reference to risk and to cost-effectiveness is stated as challenging, and in some situations contradictory. To improve this situation, and to contribute to the ability to achieve more informed decisions upon prioritising of <b>safety</b> measures <b>against</b> <b>floods</b> and landslides, we have in this paper developed a semi-quantitative approach which incorporates assessments of both risk and cost-effectiveness.

40|$|The {{ministry}} of land, infrastructures, transportation and tourism (MLIT) of the Japanese government maintains governmental managed river levee for the <b>safety</b> <b>against</b> <b>flood</b> whose total length {{is more than}} 10, 000 km. The design standard of river levee had been traditionally done based on so called shape based specification, where levee is judged to be safe {{as long as a}} section satisfies the specified dimensions. In 2002, this policy had been changed and a new inspection guideline which is based on the modern soil mechanics principles had been introduced. The method mainly consists of the non-stationary seepage analysis followed by the circular slip line stability analysis. The exit gradient and uplift pressure are also checked based on specified safety factors. The way of the safety assessment is that, first a river is divided into so called a continuous strip (CS) which is judged to have similar configurations, geotechnical and hydraulic conditions. The typical length of a CS is half to several km long. Then a representative cross section (RCS) that is considered to represent all the CS section is selected. At RCS, detailed soil investigations are carried out, and the inspection is done to assess the safety of the section for stability and piping. A CS is judged to be safe if all the verification items satisfy the specified safety factor, but judged to be NG (no good) if any of the items could not fulfill the threshold value. The first round assessment at year 2011 indicated, only 60 % of the all levee is judged to be safe for all verification items. 25 % of the levee could not satisfy the stability requirement, 30 % piping requirement, and 14 % the both requirements. In the paper, the details of the verification methods are described. Furthermore, some recent flood events are introduced. Finally, further challenges for the second screening of the safety of levee are discussed...|$|R

Many of these embankments are more than 100 years old and have been repeatedly repaired, so that detailed information on their current structure is generally missing. The monitoring of these structures is currently based, for the most part, on visual inspection and localized measurements of the embankment material parameters. However, this monitoring is generally insufficient to ensure an adequate <b>safety</b> level <b>against</b> <b>floods.</b> For these reasons there is an increasing demand for fast and accurate investigation methods, such as geophysical techniques. These techniques can {{provide detailed information on}} the subsurface structures, are non-invasive,cost-effective,andfasterthantraditionalmethods. However,they need verification in order to pro- vide reliable results, particularly in complex and reworked man-made structures such as embankments. In this paper we present a case study in which three different geophysical techniques have been applied: electrical re- sistivity tomography (ERT),frequency domain electromagnetic induction(FDEM) and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR). Two test sites have been selected, both located in the Province of Venice (NE Italy) where theTagliamento River has large embankments. The results obtained with these techniques have been calibrated against evidence resolving from geotechnical investigations. The pros and cons of each technique, as well as their relative merit at identifying the specific features of the embankments in this area, are highlighted.

It will mainly {{be based on}} the Dutch situation, where half of the population lives below sea level, but the paper will give enough discussion points for other situations. Observations, conclusions, etc., made in this paper and the presentation are on the personal account of the author, so do not represent any official view from the Netherlands. The paper briefly describes the history of creating <b>safety</b> <b>against</b> <b>flooding,</b> which started after the large flood-ing in 1953 in the south west of the Netherlands with almost 2000 casualties. This led to the situation with high and strong dikes, which should withstand a storm with a certain return period between 2, 500 and 10, 000 years. A discussion started already 15 years ago on how to derive new rules, based on probability of flooding or even on flood risk. This discussion continues, but is now fed with many more calculations on failure of flood defence assets, breaching, inundation, damage, evacuation and last but not least: indestructible dikes. ...|$|E
40|$|Wave {{overtopping}} initiates {{erosion of}} dikes, thereby compromising the <b>safety</b> <b>against</b> <b>flooding.</b> Structures integrated in a grass covered dike may decrease the resistance against erosion. In this study, CFD modelling {{is used to}} assess the effect of an asphalt road on top of the dike crest on the initiation of erosion due to wave overtopping. The Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations are solved via a k-ε turbulence model. Two wave overtopping experiments are used for validating the hydrodynamics and the coupled hydrodynamic-erosion model. The amount of scour caused by overtopping waves is predicted by combining the shear stresses from the CFD model with an erosion model including grass erosion. Both the hydrodynamics and scour depths show good agreement with the measurements. Results show that a dike profile with a road on top of the crest is more vulnerable to erosion development than a bare grass covered dike profile. This is caused by a combination of the smoother asphalt section and the damaged berms at the transitions of the asphalt with the grass cover...|$|E
40|$|The hydrodynamics of {{estuaries}} {{are forced}} by the tides from the open sea and the river runoff from the catchment area. The hinterland is often low-lying and densely populated and must therefore be protected by dikes. Anthropogenic climate change poses new challenges to the coastal protection. However, changes in the geometry of the estuaries can have equally severe impacts on the deformation of a storm surge wave form when it propagates through the estuary. This affects the peak water levels and hence the design water levels. This contribution focuses {{on the influence of}} retention areas or forelands seaside of the main dike lines, which are protected by summer dikes against the less severe but more frequently occurring storm surges. This is shown at the example of a retention area in the Weser estuary, which has historically been the cite of a soccer stadium and thus hosts high values which stand in sharp contrast <b>against</b> the low <b>safety</b> level <b>against</b> <b>flooding.</b> The investigation is conducted with a 3 D hydrodynamic numerical model which has previously been validated for the simulation of storm surges. The results show that even very small changes in the geometry of the estuary can have effects on design levels. This is even the case when they only regard the summer dike crests heights around retention areas and not their volume. Another important finding is that the geometry changes may have their maximum impacts quite far away from the specific river reach in which they are carried out. The results underline that for designing safe and reliable storm surge infrastructure, storm events should be studied in high resolution models which are able to resolve even small scale features such as summer dike lines...|$|R

40|$|Abstract i Bed level {{changes during}} a flood can have large {{influence}} on the <b>safety</b> <b>against</b> <b>flooding</b> and the navigational function of a river. In 1997 measurements were {{carried out in the}} Waal during a flood. These measurements present an average decrease of the bed level in the order of 10 cm over a 10 km reach which is much larger than expected from the current morphological models. Two reasons for this bed level decrease are suggested: the unsteady sediment load and the influence of a measuring error. The goal of this thesis is to find the main processes which affect the average bed level during floods in rivers like the Waal. The maximum influence of the unsteady sediment load is estimated using multiple empirical relations for the bed load transport, the bed particle velocity and the suspended load transport. With these models the maximum influence of the unsteady sediment load is estimated. The analysis shows that the maximum change of the sediment load can cause a bed level change in the order of 0. 7 mm during the 1997 flood in the Waal. Therefore it is concluded that the influence of unsteady sediment load is too small to significantly affect the bed level and to explain a 10 cm decrease of th...|$|E

Beside fulfilling an important role in enhancing <b>safety</b> <b>against</b> <b>flooding,</b> a CIA could contribute to the restoration of degraded ecosystem functions and habitats by implementing specific management options. However, as the outcome of some management types on ecosystem structures and functions are still uncertain, preliminary projects on a smaller scale must yield adequate information to allow, if necessary, appropriate adaptations.

Carefully designed sluices will allow the exchange of limited amounts of Scheldt water, causing a semidiurnal submersion of ca. 0. 5 m. Additionnaly, submersions with larger water quantities will occur on a less regular base during storm floods.

In addition to just flood prevention, the new policy also takes into account two other ‘layers’ of flood risk management: spatial planning, and the preparedness to deal with floods among civilians and local authorities.

The {{aim of this study}} is to quantify the uncertainty due to the hydraulic roughness predictor for the river bed in the main channel and assess its effect on the uncertainty in the modelled water levels under design conditions. The uncertainty in the bed roughness consists of the uncertainty between the different roughness predictors and the uncertainty within the roughness predictor itself. We compared five roughness predictors, which determine the hydraulic resistance of the river bed in the Dutch river Rhine, based on measurements of bedform characteristics and water levels for different discharges. Generalized Extreme Value distributions have been fitted through the predicted roughness values and extrapolated to the design return period. The results show that the 95 % confidence interval for the Generalized Extreme Value distributions the predicted Nikuradse roughness values under design conditions ranges from 0. 32 m to 1. 03 m. This uncertainty is propagated through the model by means of a Monte Carlo Simulation.
