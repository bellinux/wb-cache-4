50|$|<b>Hammerhead</b> <b>sharks</b> {{are known}} to eat a large range of prey {{including}} fish, squid, octopus, crustaceans, and other sharks. Stingrays are a particular favorite. These sharks are often found swimming {{along the bottom of}} the ocean, stalking their prey. Their unique heads are used as a weapon when hunting down prey. The <b>hammerhead</b> <b>shark</b> uses its head to pin down stingrays and eats the ray when the ray is weak and in shock. The great hammerhead, tending to be larger and more aggressive than most hammerheads, occasionally engages in cannibalism, eating other <b>hammerhead</b> <b>sharks,</b> including its own young.|$|R

50|$|In Native Hawaiian culture, {{sharks are}} {{considered}} to be gods of the sea, protectors of humans, and cleaners of excessive ocean life. Some of these sharks are believed to be family members who died and have been reincarnated into shark form. However, some sharks are considered man-eaters, also known as niuhi. These sharks include great white sharks, tiger sharks, and bull <b>sharks.</b> The <b>hammerhead</b> <b>shark,</b> also known as mano kihikihi, is not considered a man-eater or niuhi; it is considered {{to be one of the}} most respected sharks of the ocean, an aumakua. Many Hawaiian families believe that they have an aumakua watching over them and protecting them from the niuhi. The <b>hammerhead</b> <b>shark</b> is thought to be the birth animal of some children.
