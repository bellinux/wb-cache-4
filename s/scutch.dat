50|$|<b>Scutching</b> is done {{several ways}} by machine. <b>Scutching</b> mills started in Ireland, and were {{commonly}} used there by 1850, {{at a time when}} hand <b>scutching</b> was still common in Continental Europe. Machine <b>scutching,</b> while faster and cheaper, causes more waste than <b>scutching</b> by hand. One method of machine <b>scutching</b> is to crush the stalks between two metal rollers so that parts of the stalk can be separated.|$|R
50|$|<b>Scutching</b> {{is a step}} in the {{processing}} of cotton or the dressing of flax in preparation for spinning. The <b>scutching</b> process separates the impurities from the raw material, such as the seeds from raw cotton or the straw and woody stem from flax fibers. <b>Scutching</b> can be done by hand or by a machine known as a scutcher. Hand <b>scutching</b> of flax is done with a wooden <b>scutching</b> knife and a small iron scraper. The end products of <b>scutching</b> flax are the long flax fibers, short coarser fibers called tow and waste woody matter called shive.|$|R
50|$|In the <b>scutching</b> process some of {{the fiber}} is also <b>scutched</b> away along with the stalk, {{a normal part of}} the process.|$|R
50|$|The {{scutching}} knife is scraped {{down with}} a sharp strike against the fibers while they hang vertically. The edge of the knife is scraped along the fibers to pull away pieces of the stalk. This is repeated until all of the stalk has been removed and the flax is smooth and silky. When scutching was done by hand people could <b>scutch</b> up to 15 lb of flax in one day, though the amount depended {{on the quality of}} the flax. Coarser flax, harder flax and poorly retted flax takes longer to <b>scutch.</b> Retting removes the pectins that bind the fibers to the stalk and each other, so under-retted flax is harder to separate from the stalk, and often gets damaged in the scutching process. Over-retting the flax causes the fibers to deteriorate and break.|$|E
50|$|The {{banks of}} the Ballynahinch River {{in the early days}} (18th century) were dotted with little bleach greens, but as {{bleaching}} became more centralised in the Lagan-Bann region, the small greens went out of existence. The first water-powered <b>scutch</b> mills were introduced about 1750, the second in Down being at Rademon.|$|E

40|$|The {{industrial}} production of flax fibers yields two fibrous products: <b>scutched</b> fibers are valuable for their length, fineness and cleanness, while tows are entangled, impure and are low-priced. There {{is a need}} for technical data to compare these two kinds of fibers beyond the difference of appearance, and to assess their potential as composite material reinforcements. In this work, we have compared the properties of <b>scutched</b> flax and flax tows from the same batch. The morphology was first assessed by measuring the length, cleanness and fineness of fiber bundles. The tensile properties of single fibers and of unidirectionally reinforced epoxy composites were then measured. The results show that the morphology of flax tows is different from but close to the morphology of <b>scutched</b> flax. Tow bundles were 15 % shorter than <b>scutched</b> flax bundles and tow bundles were 25 % thicker than <b>scutched</b> flax bundles. The tensile properties of single fibers were in the same range. Tensile properties of the unidirectional composites show a similar evolution of properties versus fiber volume fraction. The use of <b>scutched</b> flax allowed volume fractions of 0. 7 to be achieved while tow volume fraction was limited to 0. 6. Despite the visual and morphological difference between tows and <b>scutched</b> flax both can be good candidates for composite reinforcement in high performance applications...|$|R
50|$|Codilla is {{the name}} given to the broken fibres which are {{separated}} from the flax during the <b>scutching</b> process. On this account it is sometimes termed <b>scutching</b> tow. Quantities of this material are used along with heckled tow {{in the production of}} tow yarns.|$|R

Although it is not native to Bermuda, it is an abundant invasive species there. It is presumed to have arrived in North America from Bermuda, resulting in its common name. In Bermuda it has been known as crab grass.|$|E
50|$|Richard Arkwright was a hard-nosed {{businessman}} from Preston. Arkwright {{produced a}} {{continuous spinning machine}} that was unlike Hargreaves hand operated spinning jenny. The jenny required two motions, one to draw {{and the other to}} spin and wind. Arkwrights frame spun and wound {{at the same time and}} was operated by turning a wheel. The prototype that was powered by hand, was patented in 1769. The process was particular suitable to the application of power which in those times meant a water wheel. Arkwright developed the principle into an industrial machine where a pair of frames would have 96 spindles. In searching for a reliable source of power Arkwright set up his first factory on Cromford, on the River Derwent in Derbyshire. In 1775, he filed a patents for powered preparatory machines that would card and <b>scutch</b> the roving needed by the waterframe. The lantern frame, to draw the roving, and development of the waterframe known as a throstle followed.|$|E

50|$|The Employment of Children Act 1903, while {{primarily}} {{providing for}} industries outside {{the scope of}} the Factory Act, incidentally secured that children employed as half Acts of timers should not also be employed in other occupations. The Notice of Accidents Act 1906 amended the whole system of notification of accidents, simultaneously in mines, quarries, factories and workshops, and will be set out in following paragraphs. The Factory and Workshop Act 1907 amended the law in respect of laundries by generally applying the provisions of 1901 to trade laundries while granting them choice of new exceptional periods, and by extending the provisions of the act (with certain powers to the Home Office by Orders laid before parliament to allow variations) to institution laundries carried on for charitable or reformatory purposes. The Employment of Women Act 1907 repealed an exemption in the act of 1901 (and earlier acts) relating to employment of women in flax <b>scutch</b> mills, thus bringing this employment under the ordinary provisions as to period of employment.|$|E
40|$|Throughout {{much of his}} {{writings}} tom Jones Hughes has returned {{again and again to}} the theme of Irish regionalism. Notwithstanding his acknowledgement of the role of cultural, and indeed ethnic, factors in the identification of patterns, he has most frequently employed economic variables in a search for regional indicators. His classic cartographic portrayal of the extend of eighteenth and nineteenth century landlord improvements was based on a detailed interpretation of the Griffith Valuation, and analyses of agricultural statistics provided him with the configuration of major regions of economic specialisation in post-Famine rural Ireland. Even his more recent writings have placed considerable emphasis upon economic data, as witness his mapping of farms with a valuation of one hundred pounds or more. While the ultimate goal of all this analysis has been to identify and measure the nature, scale and intensity of spatial differentiation within this island, and while he would probably recoil from being labelled an economic geographer, it is nonetheless apparent that Tom Jones Hughes’s writings suggest a strong interest in regional economies, their landscapes and their socio-cultural manifestations. This essay seeks to identify the agricultural background of probably the most distinctive regional economy to have matured in nineteenth century Ireland, the linen industry of the northern half of the country. Specifically, this essay will explore the regional dimension of flax cultivation and its immediate proto-industrial offshoot, <b>scutch</b> milling. The secondary stages of textile production – the spinning, weaving and bleaching processes – do not form part of the present study...|$|E
25|$|<b>Scutching</b> {{refers to}} the process of {{cleaning}} cotton of its seeds and other impurities. The first <b>scutching</b> machine was invented in 1797, but did not come into further mainstream use until after 1808 or 1809, when it was introduced and used in Manchester, England. By 1816, it had become generally adopted. The <b>scutching</b> machine worked by passing the cotton through a pair of rollers, and then striking it with iron or steel bars called beater bars or beaters. The beaters, which turn very quickly, strike the cotton hard and knock the seeds out. This process is done over a series of parallel bars so as to allow the seeds to fall through. At the same time, air is blown across the bars, which carries the cotton into a cotton chamber.|$|R
5000|$|The retted stalks, called straw, are dried in {{open air}} or by {{mechanical}} means, and are frequently stored {{for a short}} period to allow [...] "curing" [...] to occur, facilitating fibre removal. Final separation of the fibre is accomplished by a breaking process in which the brittle woody portion of the straw is broken, either by hand or by passing through rollers, followed by the <b>scutching</b> operation, which removes the broken woody pieces (shives) by beating or scraping. Some machines combine breaking and <b>scutching</b> operations. Waste material from the first <b>scutching,</b> consisting of shives and short fibres, is usually treated a second time. The short fibre (tow) thus obtained is frequently used in paper manufacture, and the shives may serve as fuel to heat the retting water or may be made into wallboard.|$|R

50|$|After retting, {{the stalks}} {{are ready for}} <b>scutching,</b> which takes place between August and December. <b>Scutching</b> removes the woody portion of the stalks by {{crushing}} them between two metal rollers, so that {{the parts of the}} stalk can be separated. The fibers are removed and the other parts such as linseed, shive, and tow are set aside for other uses. Next the fibers are heckled: the short fibers are separated with heckling combs by 'combing' them away, to leave behind only the long, soft flax fibers.|$|R

40|$|Various {{technical}} bottlenecks {{limit the}} production of fibre hemp for textile destinations. The HempSys Project tackled {{most of the problems}} hampering {{the production of}} hemp fibre for textiles in Europe. An innovative production system was researched and developed in which harvesting is carried out at flowering, the stem cut into two portions of approx. 1 m long which are laid on the field in swaths, stem portions kept parallel.

5000|$|Dressing is {{the broad}} term {{referring}} to removing the fibers from the straw and cleaning {{it enough to}} be spun. Dressing consists of three steps: breaking, <b>scutching</b> and heckling. After breaking, some of the straw is scraped from the fibers in the <b>scutching</b> process, then the fiber is pulled through various sized heckling combs, or hackles. Different sized heckling combs are used, progressing from coarser combs {{with only a few}} prongs or nails per inch, to finer combs. Generally three heckling combs are used; however, many more can be used. The finer the final heckling comb, the finer the yarn spun from that flax can be. An example of a progression of five combs is first using a heckling comb with four nails per square inch, then one with 12 per inch, then 25, next 48, and finally 80 nails per inch. The first three remove the straw, and the last two split and polish the fibers.|$|R

40|$|The {{falling weight}} impact {{properties}} of composites obtained by introducing 16 wt% of phormium tenax fibres extracted with two different methods i. e., either manually or by paddocking and <b>scutching</b> {{and in both}} cases chemically treated with a 1 % solution of sodium hydroxide, have been investigated. The effect of the two extraction methods on fibre characteristics is compared by the tensile properties of the fibres and the flexural properties, fracture modes and hysteresis cycles parameters (impact energy partition, linear stiffness and normalised penetration energy) of final laminates. Laminates obtained using paddocked and <b>scutched</b> fibres are clearly superior to those manufactured using the manually extracted fibres: {{this is due to}} the more effective fibre impregnation in the former case than in the latter, which results in an improved dissipation of energy during the damping phase of the impact event. It is noteworthy, however, that the low volume of fibres introduced in the laminate with the manufacturing method adopted does not allow obtaining properties comparable with other semi-structural plant fibre composites, such as e. g., hemp fibre reinforced laminates...|$|R
