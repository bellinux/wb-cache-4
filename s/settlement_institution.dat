40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{existence}} and extent of economies of scale in depository and settlement systems. Evidence from 16 settlement institutions across different regions for the years 1993 – 2000 indicates the existence of significant economies of scale. The degree of such economies, however, differs by size of <b>settlement</b> <b>institution</b> and region. While smaller settlement service providers reveal high potential of economies of scale, larger institutions show an increasing trend of cost effectiveness. Clearing and settlement systems in countries in Europe and Asia report substantially larger economies of scale {{than those of the}} US system. European cross-border settlement seems to be more cost intensive than that on a domestic level, reflecting chiefly complexities of EU international securities settlement and differences in the scope of international settlement services providers. The evidence also reveals that investments in implementing new systems and upgrades of settlement technology continuously improved cost effectiveness over the sample period. securities settlement, economies of scale, technological progress...|$|E

Those challenges are compounding water shortages, and in turn, resulting in steadily increas-ing international disputes over water. Such disputes are getting more complex and novel, involving not only states, but also legal entities, corporations, and individuals against other states. The claims now go beyond the traditional water quantity issues, and involve water quality, border lines across boundary rivers, and water rights issues. The <b>settlement</b> <b>institutions</b> have expanded considerably and now include varied international and national tribunals, as well as third and fourth parties. This article reviews and discusses those novel claims, claimants and dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>institutions,</b> and analyzes emerging trends in this area...|$|R
40|$|Economic {{theory has}} made {{considerable}} progress in explaining why sovereign countries cooperate in trade. Central to most theories of trade cooperation are issues of self-enforcement: The threat of reprisal by an aggrieved party maintains the initial balance of concessions and prevents opportunism. However, economic scholarship {{has been less}} coherent in explaining why countries choose to settle and enforce their trade disputes {{with the help of}} an impartial third party, a 2 ̆ 01 ctrade court 2 ̆ 01 d. Typically, economists focusing on the purpose of trade agreements have assumed away the very reasons why institutions are needed, since under standard assumptions, neither defection from the rules nor disputes are expected to occur. This paper is a step towards the formulation of a coherent economic theory of dispute settlement. It challenges traditional models of enforcement (primarily concerned with acts of punishment) for being insufficient in explaining the existence of dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>institutions.</b> We perform a comprehensive analysis of the economics of dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>institutions</b> and demonstrate to what extent the literatures of trade cooperation and dispute institutions are (and should be) interlinked. On the basis of these theories, we show that dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>institutions</b> in trade agreements may assume a variety of roles, including that of an information repository and disseminator, an honest broker, an arbitrator and calculator of damages, an active information gatherer or an adjudicator...|$|R
40|$|The Post-Keynesian {{theory of}} {{endogenous}} money has given {{much attention to}} the role of the central bank in the money creation process. Circuit theory has neglected this role, in so far as it has focused on the relationship between banks and firms within a monetary production economy. The aim of this paper is therefore twofold. First, it intends to fill this gap in circuit theory, by providing a role for the central bank in settlement of interbank debts. Secondly, it aims at reinforcing the Post-Keynesian analysis of central bank money by considering both the money-purveying and the credit-purveying roles of the <b>settlement</b> <b>institution</b> in the interbank market. The result of this analysis is a more comprehensive theory of endogenous money, where the lender-of-last-resort facilities of a central bank are viewed as an endogenous phenomenon involving both a money creation and a credit operation between the central bank and the domestic banking system. In such a framework, monetary policy consists of setting the base rate of interest at a level that enables banks to limit their bilateral debt position in the interbank market, so as not to disrupt the workings of the payment system by either an illiquidity or an insolvency crisis. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{performance}} of international securities markets by analysing the efficiency, economies of scale, and technological development in stock exchanges and securities settlement systems. Implications for future policy and market design are also addressed. This work provides empirical support for theoretical projections in research on stock markets. At {{the heart of this}} study is an international comparison that explores productivity, efficiency, and innovation {{of a wide range of}} stock exchanges over recent years. There is evidence of considerable variability in the efficiency of stock exchanges, both within Europe and world-wide. The evidence also indicates a positive relationship between the organisational structure and performance of the stock exchanges. It also reveals that technological change is the key driver of rising total productivity and appears to be advantageous for {{the performance of}} international securities markets. Furthermore, the study conveys how strategic interactions between stock exchanges are affected by network activity, and examines its influence on stock market performance. The adoption of network strategies was observed to be a promising tool for creating added value in the provision of trading services, and appears to be a crucial component in the strategic decision-making and performance of stock exchanges. The study also examines how far consolidation of and mergers among securities depository and settlement systems might go in the face of economies of scale and technological advancements. The results indicate substantial scale economies in settlement activities, although the extent of such effects differs by size of <b>settlement</b> <b>institution</b> and region. Overall, cost effectiveness has improved in recent years, partly due to innovations and upgrades in settlement technologies. Finally, the results are relevant for practitioners, policymakers, monetary and regulatory authorities, as they suggest further equity market integration. Networks, alliances, mergers and so forth seek to improve market efficiency, explore the benefits of economies of scale, and reduce the average transaction cost to end-users. exchanges; settlement systems; networks; economies of scale; efficiency...|$|E

40|$|The Federal Reserve's Fedwire funds {{transfer}} service - the biggest large-value payments {{system in the}} United States - has long displayed a peak of activity in the late afternoon. Theory suggests that the concentration of late-afternoon Fedwire activity reflects coordination among participating banks to reduce liquidity costs, delay costs, and credit risk; as these costs and risk change over time, payment timing most likely will be affected. This article seeks to quantify how the changing environment in which Fedwire operates has affected the timing of payment value transferred within the system between 1998 and 2006. It finds that {{the peak of the}} timing distribution has become more concentrated, has shifted to later in the day, and has actually divided into two peaks. The authors suggest that these trends can be explained by a rise in the value of payments transferred over Fedwire, the settlement patterns of the private <b>settlement</b> <b>institutions</b> that use the system, and an increase in industry concentration. Although the study's results provide no specific evidence of heightened operational risk attributable to activity occurring later in the day, they point to a high level of interaction between Fedwire and private <b>settlement</b> <b>institutions.</b> Fedwire; Payment systems; Electronic {{funds transfer}}s...|$|R
40|$|Land is an {{important}} asset for people's livelihoods and for economic development in Uganda, {{where the majority of}} people live in rural areas. This working paper reviews the literature on Uganda's tenure systems and their relationship with economic activities, focusing primarily on rural agricultural land. The review illustrates that these relationships are complex and context-dependent. Uganda's land reform was introduced with the 1998 Land Act which aims at enhancing tenure security by recognising existing rights to land. It also aims at bringing land onto the market. However, the reform's implementation has been slow and partial so far. The division of labour between land administration institutions is unclear and often institutions, for instance dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>institutions,</b> are inaccessible at the local level. Furthermore, the evidence of any links between the formalisation of land rights, investment and productivity under different tenure systems is inconclusive. Land markets exist irrespective of the tenure systems. Access to credit is quite limited, and not primarily linked to titled land as some scholars suggest. Regional differences, the urban/rural divide and social and gender characteristics are equally important. This review shows, however, that tenure insecurity, in particular in the postconflict context of northern Uganda, discourages investment and leads to lower productivity. A likely path to strengthening agricultural production would be the reinforcement of dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>institutions.</b> Furthermore, despite a gender-sensitive legal framework, women have been discriminated against in both the customary and statutory settings. Improving women's access to land would also seem important. Overall, more systematic research on these issues is required...|$|R

40|$|MA, Faculty of Humanities, School of Social Sciences, University of the Witwatersrand, 2007 The {{settlement}} of international disputes by peaceful means {{has been described}} as one of the principles basic to the whole structure of the international system. It has been contended that this principle is the natural corollary for the prohibition of {{the use of force in}} {{settlement of}} international disputes enshrined in Art. 24 of the United Nations Charter, and embodied in Art. 2 (3). The UN’s organ assigned this mediation role is the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for matters with respect to state responsibility. The International Criminal Court (ICC), the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia (ICTY), the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), and the Special Court of Sierra Leone are international tribunals with jurisdiction to try matters relating to individual criminal responsibility.

The thesis consists of five chapters. The first chapter is introductory and it specifies <b>settlement</b> as the <b>institution</b> of law in a general way. The second chapter describes a co-ownership and it is divided into five subchapters. The first four subchapters deal with regulation of co-ownership and its settlement pursuant to Act No. 40 / 1964 Coll. whereas both ways of settlement are described in these subchapters, i. e. settlement of co-ownership by agreement of the co-owners and by resolution of the court as well. The last subchapter deals with changes in regulation, which were made in connection with Act No. 89 / 2012 Coll., the Civil Code. The third chapter dedicates to settlement of the joint property of spouses which occurs, in particular, when the marriage ceases to exist. In specific situations, extinction of the joint property of spouses occurs when the marriage exists.

The data and information are original, {{never mind that the}} voices heard are nearly those of the early settlers, certainly those of their children. The authors use the records of the late 1930 s (early 1940 s) Federal Writers Projects and the Works Progress Administration to understand the reasons for Arab migration to North Dakota and the Great Plains, their employment practices, life styles (marriage patterns, culinary habits), and religious traditions, their distribution, <b>settlements,</b> <b>institutions</b> (or lack thereof), and finally their near total assimilation. If it were homesteading that attracted many Syrians to the Midwest, it was peddling that made them successful Homesteading also explains why more Lebanese than Syrians settled there. Syrians from Mt. Lebanon came from smaller, rural communities and farmed. Those from Syria proper were often from Damascus and Aleppo, established cities. An old Arab proverb states 2 ̆ 2 Trade takes a man far 2 ̆ 2 and if Syrians do anything well it is buying and selling. An entire economic chain developed among them wherein Syrian wholesalers in the Northeast supplied 2 ̆ 2 peddlers 2 ̆ 2 with goods that they brought to needy customers throughout the West. To facilitate economic success, the community published a Syrian Business Directory (1908), which included the names and addresses of every Syrian enterprise in the United States. Peddling Syrians is not a stereotype. It was their signature occupation. Another distinguishing characteristic of this book is its inclusion and respect for the early, oft-ignored Arab Muslim settlers.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of regional trading agreements {{around the world}} has changed the landscape of international trade law from a multi-polar system anchored in the nationstate to one where there are groups of closely-knit sovereign nations. They are usually drawn along geographical lines and are conducting trade with one another in a myriad of ways. This craze for trade deals is sure to give rise to disputes that are an inescapable outcome of the bilateral, regional and international agreements that contain the will of these nations to engage in greater co-operation with one another. As such, it has become necessary to design reliable dispute settlement mechanisms for the settlement of trade related disputes for the effective functioning of the trading agreements. Dispute settlement systems have progressed from being unsophisticated and diplomacy oriented as typified by that of the GATT to the highly legalized adjudication based mechanism that is the crowning glory of the WTO. This trend has been followed by other trading organizations that have modified their dispute settlement mechanisms to become more legalistic. CARICOM is a reborn regional trading bloc in the Caribbean and in lock step with the trend of other trading clubs has augmented its dispute settlement mechanism with a long awaited regional court and other non-binding alternative dispute resolution methods to avert legal clashes. This thesis examines the progress of the CARICOM dispute settlement mechanism from its originally diplomatic procedures to its enhanced legalistic system. A standing judicial institution in CARICOM is a coming of age for this region and its jurisprudence now referred to as CARICOM law. These significant legal advances raise many normative questions about the adequacy of the dispute <b>settlement</b> <b>institutions</b> and whether the rules and processes are clearly defined to enable nascent CARICOM law to be the primary tool by which there can be effective regulation of CARICOM integration. In order to answer these questions this thesis reviews the dispute settlement mechanisms of the WTO and the EU as the natural ‘parents’ of the CARICOM dispute settlement system.
