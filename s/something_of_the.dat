5|$|Lang's {{region of}} Stepney within the Diocese of London {{extended}} {{over the whole}} area generally known as London's East End, with two million people in more than 200parishes. Almost all were poor, and housed in overcrowded and insanitary conditions. Lang knew <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area from his undergraduate activities at Toynbee Hall, and his conscience was troubled by the squalor that he saw as he travelled around the district, usually by bus and tram.|$|E

5|$|The teams {{came out}} for the second half, and Rangers began an attack almost immediately. A series of short, quick passes from Marsh and Roger Morgan {{released}} Allen {{but he was not}} quick enough to make <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chance. A high pass from Keen followed, striking defender Clarke in the back, from which the Albion defence were forced to clear. The attacks continued to come from Rangers as Lazarus passed the ball through to Marsh who took the ball around two defenders, but his shot went over the bar. QPR were rewarded for their perseverance in the sixty-third minute as Lazarus took the ball around Albion captain Graham Williams, crossing the ball in for Morgan, who scored with a header to reduce the deficit to a single goal.|$|E
5|$|We knew {{we wanted}} to make a dance record. But you know, there's so many {{different}} levels of dance music and even different categories of house music. So, it was really like, what's the bass line gonna sound like? Is it gonna be really stripped down and sparse, or {{is it going to be}} loaded up? Is it gonna be Chicago house? Is it gonna be U.K. house? It's like, all over the place. Is it gonna be a little bit of one vocal line? Is it gonna be a whole choir singing? So we were experimenting and trying out different things. They all sounded good, but at the end of the day, we wanted it to sound timeless, also. Not just <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moment.|$|E
5|$|Keable {{eventually}} achieved {{his wish}} {{of going to}} war in 1917, when a South African contingent was mustered for military service in France and Keable volunteered {{to go with them}} as chaplain. His experiences there were to form the basis for his first and most successful novel, Simon Called Peter. Appointed an army chaplain on 26 May 1917, Keable travelled to the Rouen sector with a Native Labour Contingent of 21,000 men. These men were paid £3 per month to unload supply ships and provide infrastructure support for military operations in Europe. As a chaplain, with the rank of captain, Keable was expected to be at the disposal of the army at large, and ministered to those seeing active infantry service as well as to labourers. Padres were formally required to remain behind the lines, but it is apparent that Keable nonetheless saw <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> realities of the frontline.|$|E

25|$|Suzuki {{reportedly}} {{was involved}} with some anti-war activities during World War II, but according to David Chadwick, the record is confusing and, at most, his actions were low-key.

25|$|In the 1880s, Clayton and Bell’s work {{went through}} {{something}} of a revival. Remarkably, many windows produced in the 1880s and 90s have the recaptured <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> freshness and brightness of the earlier works. They are in strong contrast to those of their pupils, Burlison and Grylls, who specialised in silvery backgrounds with ornate canopies under which stand solidly three-dimensional figures in vast cloaks of wine red and indigo blue.|$|E

25|$|The {{immediate}} commercial {{failure of}} the novel has been suggested as pivotal in Herbert's later career – {{it was clear to}} him that novel-writing was not likely to prove financially rewarding, which helped focus his efforts on light journalism and set the tone for most of his later writings. He would not write anything quite the same again – The House by the River (1920), a crime novel, retains <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> simple style, but begins to introduce elements of humour not found in The Secret Battle.|$|E
25|$|The novella is {{generally}} not as formally experimental as the long story and the novel can be, and it usually lacks the subplots, the multiple points of view, and the generic adaptability that are common in the novel. It is most often concerned with personal and emotional development rather than with the larger social sphere. The novella generally retains <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unity of impression that is {{a hallmark of the}} short story, but it also contains more highly developed characterization and more luxuriant description.|$|E
25|$|At {{this time}} I visited {{one of our}} Advent sisters, {{and in the morning}} we bowed around the family altar.

While praying, the power of God came upon me as I never had felt it before, and I was wrapt up in a vision of God's glory, and seemed to be rising higher and higher from the earth and was shown <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> travels of the Advent people to the Holy City...|$|E

50|$|Another <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Raiders' favored {{techniques}} involved {{sending out}} teams of spies {{to track down}} prisoners suspected of having valuables which could be traded to camp guards.

25|$|With our {{knowledge}} of the complete unalterability both of character and of mental faculties, we are led to the view that a real and thorough improvement of the human race might be reached not so much from outside as from within, not so much by theory and instruction as rather by the path of generation. Plato had <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kind in mind when, in the fifth book of his Republic, he explained his plan for increasing and improving his warrior caste. If we could castrate all scoundrels and stick all stupid geese in a convent, and give men of noble character a whole harem, and procure men, and indeed thorough men, for all girls of intellect and understanding, then a generation would soon arise which would produce a better age than that of Pericles.|$|E
25|$|At {{the behest}} of our leader Herzl, I came to Basle to make {{preparations}} for the Zionist Congress. Among many other problems that occupied me then was one that contained <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> essence of the Jewish problem. What flag would we hang in the Congress Hall? Then an idea struck me. We have a flag—and it is blue and white. The talith (prayer shawl) with which we wrap ourselves when we pray: that is our symbol. Let us take this Talith from its bag and unroll it before the eyes of Israel and the eyes of all nations. So I ordered a blue and white flag with the Shield of David painted upon it. That is how the national flag, that flew over Congress Hall, came into being.|$|E
25|$|<b>Something</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{feel of the}} university's quality can {{be gained}} {{from the work of}} some of its professors. Among them were Estius (Willem Hessels van Est), (1542–1613), the {{commentator}} on the Pauline epistles. He had studied classics at Utrecht and afterwards spent some twenty years at Louvain, in the study of philosophy, theology and Holy Scripture, and in 1580 received the degree of Doctor of Theology. In 1582 he became Professor of Theology at Douai, a position which he retained for thirty-one years and which he combined for the last eighteen years of his life with that of Chancellor of the University, in addition to being for many years rector of the diocesan seminary. Estius's works were written in Latin and for the greater part published posthumously.|$|E
50|$|According {{to local}} lore, {{in the colonial}} period thieves caught in Tepito were hung here using the large Montezuma cypress trees that the area had, which became <b>something</b> <b>of</b> a spectacle. <b>The</b> now dry land became hacienda {{generally}} dedicated to <b>the</b> raising <b>of</b> horses.|$|R
