40|$|A {{detailed}} {{study on the}} resulting impurity profile in Si samples implanted with high doses of Ti and subsequently annealed by pulsed-laser melting (PLM) is reported. Two different effects are shown to rule the impurity profile redistribution during the annealing. During the melting stage, {{the thickness of the}} implanted layer increases while the maximum peak concentration decreases (box-shaped effect). On the contrary, during the solidifying stage, the thickness of the layer decreases and the maximum peak concentration increases (<b>snow-plow</b> <b>effect).</b> Both effects are more pronounced as the energy density of the annealing increases. Moreover, as a direct consequence of the <b>snow-plow</b> <b>effect,</b> part of the impurities is expelled from the sample through the surface...|$|E
40|$|A {{mathematical}} model describing the <b>snow-plow</b> <b>effect,</b> i. e. {{the removal of}} adsorbed ions from soil particles by an incoming solution with relatively high solute concentration, is analyzed. It is shown that an accurate numerical solution to the model must be obtained to investigate {{the influence of the}} parameters entering the problem. The numerical solution helps generate simple rules that allow for straightforward but accurate construction of snow plows in practical situations. The numerical results are also used to evaluate an earlier analytical approximation and are compared to experimental observations...|$|E
40|$|Epitaxial {{growth of}} a NiSi 2 layer was {{observed}} on S+ ion-implanted Si(100) at a low temperature of 550 degrees C. Depending on the S+ dose and the Ni thickness, we identified different nickel silicide phases. High quality and uniform epitaxial NiSi 2 layers formed at temperatures above 700 degrees C with a 20 -nm Ni on high dose S+ implanted Si(100), whereas no epitaxy was observed for a 36 -nm Ni layer. We assume {{that the presence of}} sulfur at the silicide/Si(100) interface favors the nucleation of the NiSi 2 phase. The S atom distributions showed ultrasteep S depth profiles (3 nm/decade) in the silicon, which results from the <b>snow-plow</b> <b>effect</b> during silicidation and the segregation of S to the interface due to the low solubility of S in both Si and the silicide...|$|E
40|$|Nonlinear {{principal}} component analysis (NLPCA) and image decoding are {{used to determine the}} spatial pattern of a total electron content (TEC) map anomaly in the ionosphere above China’s Wenchuan earthquake of 12 May, 2008 (UT) (Mw =  7. 9). The earthquake occurred at 06 : 28 : 01 UT and the time period examined using NLPCA is 06 : 00 to 08 : 00 UT. The TEC map of previous time period is transformed to an input matrix of NLPCA using image decoding, and then the TEC anomaly found is widespread and less intense at an altitude of 200  km using NLPCA; however, it becomes more intense and localized with height up to an altitude of 300  km. This paper discusses potential causes of the anomaly with emphasis on very rising acoustic shockwaves and <b>snow-plow</b> <b>effects</b> on ionospheric electron plasma resulting from the mainshock of the earthquake...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{impurities}} {{on the growth}} of the Pd 2 Si layer upon thermal annealing of a Pd film on 100 line-type and amorphous Si substrates is investigated. Nitrogen and oxygen impurities are introduced into either Pd or Si which are subsequently annealed to form Pd 2 Si. The complementary techniques of Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, and N- 15 (p, alpha) C- 12 or O- 18 (p, alpha) N- 15 nuclear reaction, are used to investigate the behavior of nitrogen or oxygen and the alterations each creates during silicide formation. Both nitrogen and oxygen retard the silicide growth rate if initially present in Si. When they are initially in Pd, there is no significant retardation; instead, an interesting <b>snow-plowing</b> <b>effect</b> of N or O by the reaction interface of Pd 2 Si is observed. By using N implanted into Si as a marker, Pd and Si appear to trade roles as the moving species when the silicide front reaches the nitrogen-rich region...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} scheme {{based on}} the mixing cell concept is used to analyse multispecies solute transport under the condition of steady flow. Explicit examples are presented for the case of two chemical species that are reacting during transport. Also, unlike the standard mixing cell approach, the improved method used here maintains second- order accuracy. The mixing cell scheme is applied to various data sets from multispecies transport experiments. First, the scheme is used to analyse the <b>snow-plow</b> <b>effect</b> as observed in a laboratory experiment. This phenomenon results from large concentration differences in the solution and solid phases within the soil profile. The analysis revealed that the solute exchange process is time dependent, rather than being in equilibrium. In another case, the scheme was used to analyse the observed snow- plow peaks of Ca resulting from ion exchange reactions between Ca and Mg in a soil profile. The analysis revealed that the selectivity coefficient changes with total cation concentration in the system. The results demonstrate that nonlinear reactions in multispecies transport can be analysed efficiently, accurately, and quickly using the improved mixing cell model...|$|E
40|$|LORS DU PROCESSUS DE FORMATION STELLAIRE, DE FORMIDABLES EJECTIONS BIPOLAIRES DE MATIERE SONT OBSERVEES, EN PLUS DE L'ACCRETION SUR L'OBJET CENTRAL. DEUX COMPOSANTES CONSTITUENT CES FLOTS BIPOLAIRES : LES JETS (RAPIDES, COLLIMATES ET LEGERS) ET LES FLOTS MOLECULAIRES (PLUS LENTS, LARGES ET DENSES). IL EST SOUVENT ADMIS QUE LE JET EST RESPONSABLE DU FLOT MOLECULAIRE, LORSQUE CE PREMIER ENTRAINE PAR EFFET CHASSE-NEIGE LE MILIEU AMBIANT DANS LEQUEL IL SE PROPAGE. DANS CETTE THESE, NOUS NOUS INTERESSONS PRINCIPALEMENT AUX FLOTS MOLECULAIRES PAR L'ETUDE D'UN MODELE ALTERNATIF ET COMPLEMENTAIRE DE LA VISION STANDARD MENTIONNEE CI-DESSUS. DANS CE MODELE DE >, UNE PARTIE DU GAZ EN CHUTE EN DIRECTION DE L'OBJET CENTRAL EST DEVIEE (TRANSIT) DANS LES DIRECTIONS BIPOLAIRES, EN RAISON DE L'AUGMENTATION DE LA TEMPERATURE ET DE LA DENSITE LORSQUE LA DISTANCE A LA PROTO-ETOILE DIMINUE. NOUS MONTRONS QUE DES SOLUTIONS EXISTENT SANS QU'UN CHAMP MAGNETIQUE SOIT PRESENT, IMPLIQUANT UNE NATURE THERMODYNAMIQUE DU PROCESSUS QUE NOUS DECRIVONS. LES SOLUTIONS MAGNETISEES SONT CEPENDANT EN MEILLEUR ACCORD AVEC LES OBSERVATIONS, CONFIRMANT QUE LE CHAMP MAGNETIQUE EST UN INGRDIENT IMPORTANT DU PROCESSUS DE FORMATION STELLAIRE. GRACE A CE MODELE, NOUS PARVENONS SANS DIFFICULTE A ATTEINDRE LES ENORMES MASSES CHARRIEES DANS LES FLOTS D'ETOILES MASSIVES PUISQUE LE MODELE N'EST PAS LIMITE A CE QU'UN JET PEUT ENTRAINER. LA COMPOSITION DU MILIEU INFLUE EGALEMENT SUR LES SOLUTIONS OBTENUES ET IL EST MONTRE QUE L'ABSENCE DE POUSSIERES DANS LE MILIEU ENTRIANE POTENTIELLEMENT LA FORMATION D'ETOILES PLUS MASSIVES QUE CELLES QUI SE FORMENT DANS L'UNIVERS ACTUEL (OU LA POUSSIERE EST PRESENTE). WHEN A STAR FORMS, NOT ONLY GAS ACCRETES ONTO THE CENTRAL OBJECT BUT POWERFUL BIPOLAR EJECTIONS OF MATERIAL ARE ALSO OBSERVED. THESE BIPOLAR OUTFLOWS ARE GENERALLY SEPERATED INTO TWO COMPONENTS: THE JETS (FAST, HIGHLY COLLIMATED AND LIGHT) AND THE MOLECULAR OUTFLOWS (SLOWER, WIDER AND DENSER). IT IS USELY ACCEPTED THAT THE JETS ARE THE CAUSE OF THE MOLECULAR OUTFLOWS AS THEY ENTRAIN THE GAS OF THE MEDIUM THEY ARE PROPAGATING IN, VIA A <b>SNOW-PLOW</b> <b>EFFECT.</b> IN THIS THESIS, WE ARE PRIMARILY INTERESTED BY MOLECULAR OUTFLOWS AND STUDY AN ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MODEL OF THE STANDARD JET-DRIVEN MODEL DESCRIBED ABOVE. IN OUR SO-CALLED "TRANSIT MODEL", PART OF THE INFALLING GAZ IS BEING DIVERTED INTO A BIPOLAR OUTFLOW AS THE DENSITY AND TEMPERATURE INCREASE WITH DECREASING DISTANCE TO THE CENTRAL OBJECT. WE SOLVE THE SYSTEM OF EQUATIONS DESCRIBING THE MODEL IN BOTH THE UNMAGNETISED AND MAGNETISED CASE. THE EXISTENCE OF PURELY HYDRODYNAMICAL SOLUTIONS SHOW THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL NATURE OF THE PROCESS DESCRIBED HERE IS THERMODYNAMICAL. HOWEVER, MAGNETISED SOLUTIONS COMPARE BETTER WITH OBSERVATIONS, CONFIRMING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD IN THE STAR FORMATION PROCESS. WITH THE TRANSIT MODEL, IT IS POSSIBLE TO REACH WITHOUT DIFFICULTIES THE HUGE MASS OBSERVED IN THE OUTFLOWS OF MASSIVE FORMING STARS : INDEED, IN THE MODEL, THE MASS IN THE MOLECULAR OUTFLOW IS NOT LIMITED TO THE MASS THAT CAN BE ENTRAINED BY AN UNDERLYING JET. WE ALSO STUDIED THE INFLUENCE O F THE COMPOSITION OF THE GAS ON THE SOLUTIONS AND FOUND THAT MORE MASSIVE STARS CAN POTENTIALLY FORM WHEN DUST DOES NOT DOMINATE THE COOLING OF THE GAS, AS IT IS IN THE PRESENT-DAY UNIVERSE.
