But {{it is not good}} for you to depend on anyone so much for your happiness, I think, and I know it is bad for me to feel that I have so much power over a fellow creature. Go away, Mac, and see if this isn't all a mistake.

6000|$|They talk of murderers being pretty {{certainly}} found out. Psha! I {{have heard}} an authority awfully competent vow and declare that scores {{and hundreds of}} murders are committed, and nobody is the wiser. That terrible man mentioned one or two ways of committing murder, which he maintained were quite common, and were scarcely ever found out. A man, for instance, comes home to his wife, and [...] . but I pause--I know that this Magazine has a very large circulation. Hundreds and hundreds of thousands--why not say a million of people at once?--well, say a million, read it. And amongst these countless readers, I might be teaching some monster how to make away with his wife without being found out, some fiend of a woman how to destroy her dear husband. I will NOT then tell this easy and simple way of murder, as communicated to me by a most respectable party in the confidence of private intercourse. Suppose some gentle reader were to try this most simple and easy receipt--it seems to me almost infallible--and come to grief in consequence, and be found out and hanged? Should I ever pardon myself for having been the means of doing injury to {{a single one of}} our esteemed subscribers? The prescription whereof I speak--that is to say, whereof I DON'T speak--shall be buried in this bosom. No, I am a humane man. I am not one of your Bluebeards to go and say to my wife, [...] "My dear! I am going away for a few days to Brighton. Here are all the keys of the house. You may open every door and closet, except the one {{at the end of the}} oak-room opposite the fireplace, with the little bronze Shakespeare on the mantel-piece (or what not)." [...] I don't say this to a woman--unless, to be <b>sure,</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> get rid of her--because, after such a caution, I know she'll peep into the closet. I say nothing about the closet at all. I keep the key in my pocket, and a being whom I love, but who, as I know, has many weaknesses, out of harm's way. You toss up your head, dear angel, drub on the ground with your lovely little feet, on the table with your sweet rosy fingers, and cry, [...] "Oh, sneerer! You don't know the depth of woman's feeling, the lofty scorn of all deceit, the entire absence of mean curiosity in the sex, or never, never would you libel us so!" [...] Ah, Delia! dear, dear Delia! It is because I fancy I do know something about you (not all, mind--no, no; no man knows that)--Ah, my bride, my ringdove, my rose, my poppet--choose, in fact, whatever name you like--bulbul of my grove, fountain of my desert, sunshine of my darkling life, and joy of my dungeoned existence, it is because I DO know a little about you that I conclude to say nothing of that private closet, and keep my key in my pocket. You take away that closet-key then, and the house-key. You lock Delia in. You keep her out of harm's way and gadding, and so she never CAN be found out.|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{n't mean}} that. I am sure I am very glad to see you--I should {{think you would have}} found out that by this time. I mean I 'm glad to see any one--especially a man. I suppose it 's {{improper}} for me to say that--especially to you! There--you see I do think more of you than of some gentlemen. Why especially to you? Well, because you always seem to me to want to take advantage. I did n't say a base advantage; I did n't accuse you of anything dreadful. I 'm <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> take advantage, too--I take it whenever I can. You see I take advantage of your being here--I 've got so many things to say. I have n't spoken a word in three days, and I 'm sure it is a pleasant change--a gentleman's visit. All of a sudden we have gone into mourning; I 'm sure I don't know who 's dead. Is it Mr. Gordon Wright? It 's some idea of Mrs. Vivian's--I 'm sure it is n't mine. She thinks we have been often enough to the Kursaal. I don't know whether she thinks it 's wicked, or what. If it 's wicked the harm 's already done; I can't be any worse than I am now. I have seen all the improper people and I have learnt all their names; Captain Lovelock has told me their names, plenty of times. I don't see what good it does me to be shut up here with all those names running in my ears. I must say I do prefer society. We have n't been to the Kursaal for four days--we have only gone out for a drive. We have taken the most interminable drives. I do believe we have seen every old ruin in the whole country. Mrs. Vivian and Angela are so awfully fond of scenery--they talk about it by the half-hour. They talk about the mountains and trees as if they were people they knew--as if they were gentlemen! I mean as if the mountains and trees were gentlemen. Of course scenery 's lovely, but you can't walk about with a tree. At any rate, that has been all our society--foliage! Foliage and women; but I suppose women are a sort of foliage. They are always rustling about and dropping off. That 's why I could n't make up my mind to go out with them this afternoon. They 've gone to see the Waterworths--the Waterworths arrived yesterday and are staying at some hotel. Five daughters--all unmarried! I don't know what kind of foliage they are; some peculiar kind--they don't drop off. I thought I had had about enough ladies' society--three women all sticking together! I don't think it 's good for a young girl to have nothing but ladies' society--it 's so awfully limited. I suppose I ought to stand up for my own sex and tell you that when we are alone together we want for nothing. But we want for everything, as it happens! Women's talk is limited--every one knows that. That 's just what mamma did n't want when she asked Mrs. Vivian to take charge of me. Now, Mr. Longueville, what are you laughing at?--you are always laughing at me. She wanted me to be unlimited--is that what you say? Well, she {{did n't want me to}} be narrowed down; she wanted me to have plenty of conversation. She wanted me to be fitted for society--that 's what mamma wanted. She wanted me to have ease of manner; she thinks that if you don't acquire it when you are young you never have it at all. She was so happy to think I should come to Baden; but she would n't approve of the life I 've been leading the last four days. That 's no way to acquire ease of manner--sitting all day in a small parlor with two persons of one's own sex! Of course Mrs. Vivian's influence--that 's the great thing. Mamma said it was like the odor of a flower. But you don't want to keep smelling a flower all day, even the sweetest; that 's the shortest way to get a headache. Apropos of flowers, do you happen to have heard whether Captain Lovelock is alive or dead? Do I call him a flower? No; I call him a flower-pot. He always has some fine young plant in his button-hole. He has n't been near me these ten years--I never heard of anything so rude!" ...|$|E

5000|$|I {{do not go}} as far as to name, or classify, {{what the}} Dark Fall {{actually}} is. That would be rather foolish. To name and explain the force would defeat the object of the game; that being to present a formless, existential horror, that exists purely {{in the mind of the}} gamer. One person's perception of hell, limbo and the afterlife is a very personal thing. I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> state what I believe exists in the next world, or whether anything exists at all. The writing in Dark Fall leaves each gamer to come to their own conclusions in regards to concepts such as ghosts, evil, death and purgatory.

5000|$|Bryne Yancey of Alternative Press was {{critical}} of the band's musical divergences on the album, stating that [...] "Unfortunately, much like adolescence itself, This Is Only a Test isn't without its moments of awkwardness.

[...] However, he noted that [...] "there are still plenty of hooks to be found on the album, especially it its loaded first half", comparing the band to Weezer and calling the album [...] "a mostly successful experiment." [...] Tori of Punknews.org had similar criticisms, saying of [...] "Excuse Me, Coach" [...] that [...] "I'm not sure what they were thinking, and I'm not <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know", and calling the spoken-word verses in [...] "Diary of a Teen Tragedy" [...] "downright cringeworthy": [...] "The reality remains that the Caterer brothers are not high schoolers.

[...] However, he called these [...] "small complaints", concluding that [...] "Aside from a couple blunders, This Is Only a Test is a thoroughly enjoyable pop-rock album.

Many are still unsure of why they were selected to participate {{and whether or not}} they themselves will choose to stay. What’s this about? I’m not <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be here! I’ve got nothing to say! We’re all the naughty kids – are we in trouble? The conversation continues like this with each boy talking himself out of participating in a research project organized to find out more about how young adolescent students, loosely classified as ‘at risk’, experience school and learning, and more generally what makes them ‘tick’. Kate (Middle School Director of Curriculum and my research off-sider) and I can feel the session slipping away and the potential of our research evaporating. One of the boys (a leader and an influence in the group even at this early stage) draws breath and shares HIS view with the group [said with fist banging the desk and with true Dr King charisma]: My mum says being part of this group is an opportunity for me to have a say – to tell the truth about school. A ripple goes through the group, the energy skyrockets and all the boys respond ‘Yeah! ’ And so, Photovoice in the Middle: How Our students Experience Learning at School and Beyond is born.
