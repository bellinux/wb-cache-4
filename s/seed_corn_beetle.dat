40|$|Sweet corn {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} vegetable crops produced in New York, in terms of acreage, crop value and number of producers. Fresh market and processing sweet corn are produced for local, regional, and national markets. With the exception of rust and <b>seed</b> decay, sweet <b>corn</b> has relatively few disease problems relative to other vegetables. A wide variety of insects attack the crop, causing losses in yield as well as quality. However quality is critical, especially in the fresh market wholesale business. Wholesale buyers of sweet corn can reject entire shipments if damage levels are as low as 10 %. New York sweet corn producers generally use sound integrated pest management practices in managing insects and other pests. While a relatively large number of insecticides are registered for use, organophosphates remain important tools for resistance management and/or control for pests such as <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> maggot, flea <b>beetles,</b> garden symphylans, and aphids. Weeds are also major pests of sweet corn. Without the registration of new, effective materials to replace them, the loss of chlorpyrifos, diazinon, terbufos, atrazine, alachlor, metolachlor, bentazon, and propiconazole would have significant impacts on production and profitability...|$|R

These feeding lesions run parallel to the leaf veins and they first appear as thin, silvery or white streaks. Heavily injured leaves turn brown and wilt. The insect also can transmit Stewart 2 ̆ 7 s wilt, also called Stewart 2 ̆ 7 s disease. This disease can be controlled on susceptible corn by controlling the <b>corn</b> flea <b>beetle</b> with an insecticide.

40|$|Stewart 2 ̆ 7 s {{disease of}} corn, caused by Pantoea (Erwinia) stewartii has {{significant}} economic implications for sweet and <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> producers.

40|$|In 1957, 1567 {{acres of}} hybrid <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> were {{approved}} for certification. This was the smallest annual number of acres reported {{during the period}} 1948 through 1957. Two of the factors responsible for this decline were:(1) intensive price competition between certified grower-sellers had resulted in low prices and elimination of many certified growers, and (2) most of the certified grower-sellers had very small seed volumes and could not finance adequate advertising and sales promotion programs. The marketing problems of certified growers were discussed during {{the annual meeting of}} Nebraska Certified Hybrid <b>Seed</b> <b>Corn</b> Producers Association in March 1958 and in June 1958 the Nebraska Hybrid Seed Growers Association was formed and incorporated as a marketing cooperative of certified growers. The objectives of this study are: To describe the marketing system of hybrid <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> in Nebraska, including the channels of distribution for certified hybrid <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> and commercial hybrid <b>seed</b> <b>corn,</b> and the importance of the various distributors. To describe the hybrid <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> market in Nebraska with respect to: its structure, supply and demand, production, processing, and marketing cots, average seed prices, and marketing margins. To evaluate the success of the Nebraska Hybrid Seed Growers Association in resolving the marketing problem of certified hybrid <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> growers. Certified growers have been doing an excellent job of producing and processing hybrid <b>seed</b> <b>corn.</b> Although the quality of the certified growers’ processing operations is high, costs could be reduced by hiring custom operators to perform these operations. In addition, marketing operations of some of the certified grower-sellers have not been too effective. From the limited marketing information obtained in the survey of certified growers, there were indications that small volume (200 to 1000 bushels) certified grower-sellers still have marketing problems which were prevalent in 1957. Larger volume certified grower-sellers apparently have solved some of their marketing problems, and have been more effective than small volume certified grower-sellers in marketing their seed. The Nebraska Hybrid Seed Growers Association, established in 1958 to market hybrid <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> for its certified grower-members, has encountered and apparently solved some of the marketing problems. However, other marketing problems remain for future solution. Since the Association has been in operation only two years, its success in resolving the marketing problems of certified grower-members cannot be substantiated at this time. Advisor: C. J.

The original sample, obtained before the gravity table separation, and four fractions (heavy, medium heavy, medium light, and light) obtained from the discharge edge of each gravity table, were analyzed for physical (bulk density, weight of 100 seeds, volume, specific gravity, terminal velocity, purity, breakage susceptibility, and pericarp injury), physiological (standard germination, cold germination, conductivity, and field emergence), and chemical composition (NIR protein, oil, and starch contents);Both gravity tables performed similarly as determined by the seed quality of various fractions. Flat <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> was better in seed quality than round <b>seed</b> <b>corn.</b> The gravity table was efficient in separating <b>seed</b> <b>corn</b> into fractions of different quality along the discharge edge of the gravity table deck. However, when the initial seed quality of a lot is high, only marginal improvement in seed quality was obtained.

The medium light fraction may be re-conditioned to recover fractions of acceptable seed quality.
