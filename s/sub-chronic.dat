50|$|The {{protocol}} {{presents a}} summary of safety pharmacology studies in two species (rat, dog) and repeated dose toxicity studies in four species (13-week <b>sub-chronic</b> studies in mouse, dog and monkey; a 26-week chronic study in the rat).

The authors also report no effects of significance in the animal models used for the CNS safety pharmacology studies, which studied a dose of up to 300 mg/kg/day. The protocol nominates a human NOAEL of 100 mg as a human equivalent dose to the 26-week rat NOAEL, though with no description how this was calculated.

50|$|Calciferols (vitamins D), {{cholecalciferol}} (vitamin D3) and ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) {{are used}} as rodenticides. They are toxic to rodents {{for the same reason}} they are important to humans: they affect calcium and phosphate homeostasis in the body. Vitamins D are essential in minute quantities (few IUs per kilogram body weight daily, only a fraction of a milligram), and like most fat soluble vitamins, they are toxic in larger doses, causing hypervitaminosis. If the poisoning is severe enough (that is, if the dose of the toxin is high enough), it leads to death. In rodents that consume the rodenticidal bait, it causes hypercalcemia, raising the calcium level, mainly by increasing calcium absorption from food, mobilising bone-matrix-fixed calcium into ionised form (mainly monohydrogencarbonate calcium cation, partially bound to plasma proteins, CaHCO3+), which circulates dissolved in the blood plasma. After ingestion of a lethal dose, the free calcium levels are raised sufficiently that blood vessels, kidneys, the stomach wall and lungs are mineralised/calcificated (formation of calcificates, crystals of calcium salts/complexes in the tissues, damaging them), leading further to heart problems (myocardial tissue is sensitive to variations of free calcium levels, affecting both myocardial contractibility and excitation propagation between atrias and ventriculas), bleeding (due to capillary damage) and possibly kidney failure. It is considered to be single-dose, cumulative (depending on concentration used; the common 0.075% bait concentration is lethal to most rodents after a single intake of larger portions of the bait) or <b>sub-chronic</b> (death occurring usually within days to one week after ingestion of the bait). Applied concentrations are 0.075% cholecalciferol and 0.1% ergocalciferol when used alone, which can kill a rodent or a rat.|$|E

Objective The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether the deficits induced by <b>sub-chronic</b> PCP in attentional set-shifting could be reversed by <b>sub-chronic</b> administration of clozapine, risperidone or haloperidol. Methods Adult female hooded-Lister rats received <b>sub-chronic</b> PCP (2 mg/kg) or vehicle (1 ml/kg) i. p. twice daily for 7 days, followed by a 7 -day washout period.

Thus, acute and <b>sub-chronic</b> PCP treatment in rodents might produce anhedonia, {{a decrease in the}} pleasure produced by rewards. Objectives Experiment 1 investigated whether acute PCP treatment changes the value of sucrose. A comparison was made to (+) MK- 801, a drug often used interchangeably with PCP in preclinical studies. Experiment 2 assessed the effects of withdrawal from <b>sub-chronic</b> PCP treatment on the value of sucrose. Methods Experiment 1 examined the dose–response effects of PCP and (+) MK- 801 on licking microstructure during sucrose consumption. Experiment 2 assessed the effects of withdrawal from <b>sub-chronic</b> PCP treatment (5 mg/kg twice daily for 7 days), on licking microstructure during sucrose consumption. Locomotor activity testing was carried out in experiment 2 to confirm the sensitisation effect of the PCP regimen on amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion. Results Low to moderate acute doses of PCP and (+) MK- 801 increased the amount of sucrose consumed. Higher doses decreased consumption and the number of licks per cluster (cluster size) but also increased the average inter-lick interval, which may indicate motor impairment. There was no evidence that withdrawal from <b>sub-chronic</b> PCP treatment produced decreases in consumption or lick cluster size. Conclusions Following acute PCP treatment, we found no evidence of reduced reward value without the presence of confounding motor deficits. <b>Sub-chronic</b> PCP withdrawal also produced no decrease in reward value.

40|$|NoAcute {{administration}} of the psychotomimetic phencyclidine (PCP) can mimic some features of schizophrenia, while a repeated treatment regimen of PCP may provide a more effective way to model in animals the enduring cognitive dysfunction observed in many schizophrenic patients. The present study aims to investigate behavioural and neuropathological effects of <b>sub-chronic</b> PCP administration. The cognitive deficit induced by <b>sub-chronic</b> PCP was examined using a previously established operant reversal-learning paradigm. Subsequently, the effect of <b>sub-chronic</b> PCP on parvalbumin-immunoreactive (parvalbumin-IR) neurons was assessed using immunohistochemical techniques. Rats were trained to respond for food in an operant reversal-learning paradigm for approximately 6 weeks, followed by <b>sub-chronic</b> {{administration of}} PCP (2 mg/kg) or vehicle twice daily for 7 days followed 7 days later by behavioural testing. Six weeks post PCP, brains were analysed using immunohistochemical techniques to determine the size and density of parvalbumin-IR in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. <b>Sub-chronic</b> PCP significantly reduced (p < 0. 001) percentage correct responding in the reversal phase relative to the initial phase, an effect that persisted throughout the experimental period (4 weeks). The density of parvalbumin-IR neurons was reduced in the hippocampus, with significant reductions in the dentate gyrus and CA 2 / 3 regions (p < 0. 001).

40|$|Rationale: Atypical antipsychotic-induced {{weight gain}} is a {{significant}} impediment {{in the treatment of}} schizophrenia. Objectives: In a putative model of antipsychotic drug-induced weight gain, we investigated the effects of <b>sub-chronic</b> olanzapine on body weight, meal patterns, the expression of genes encoding for hypothalamic feeding-related neuropeptides and the contribution of hyperphagia to olanzapine-induced weight gain in rats. Materials and methods: In experiment 1, female rats received either olanzapine (1 mg/kg, p. o.) or vehicle, twice daily for 7 days, while meal patterns were recorded. At the end of the treatment regimen, we measured the levels of hypothalamic messenger RNAs (mRNAs) encoding neuropeptide-Y (NPY), hypocretin/orexin (HCRT), melanin concentrating hormone and pro-opiomelanocortin. NPY and HCRT mRNA levels were also assessed in a separate cohort of female rats treated acutely with olanzapine (1 mg/kg, p. o.). In experiment 2, we investigated the effect of a pair-feeding paradigm on <b>sub-chronic</b> (1 mg/kg, p. o.) olanzapine-induced weight gain. Results: In experiment 1, <b>sub-chronic</b> olanzapine increased body weight, food intake and meal size. Hypothalamic neuropeptide mRNA levels were unchanged after both acute and <b>sub-chronic</b> olanzapine treatment. In experiment 2, the restriction of food intake to the level of vehicle-treated controls abolished the <b>sub-chronic</b> olanzapine-induced increase in body weight. Conclusions: Hyperphagia mediated by drug-induced impairments in satiety (as evidenced by increased meal size) is a key requirement for olanzapine-induced weight gain in this paradigm.

A synthetic analog of one Cortexin fraction, Cortagen (i. e. Ala-Glu-Asp-Pro peptide), was developed. Both agents stimulate neural growth in vitro, presumably in association with neurotrophic factors. We assessed the psychoactive effects of Cortexin and cortagen, using elevated plus maze (EPM) and locomotor activity habituation (LAH) paradigms in CD- 1 mice. In Exp. I, mice were injected with Cortexin (0, 0. 25, 0. 50, or 1. 00 mg/kg i. p.) and tested in the EPM (acute) and the LAH (<b>sub-chronic</b> response). In Exp. II, separate mice were injected with cortagen (0, 0. 01, 0. 03, or 0. 10 mg/kg i. p.) or a reference dose of Cortexin, and tested in the LAH (acute and <b>sub-chronic)</b> and the EPM (<b>sub-chronic</b> response). Results: Evidence of anxyolitic effects {{was found in the}} EPM for acute Cortexin treatment at the 0. 25 and 1. 00 mg/kg dosages. The Cortexin 0. 25 mg/kg was selected as reference dose for Exp.

The animals underwent three behavioural tests in novel environments. In the observation cages (Test 1), rat locomotor activity {{was found to be}} dose-dependently reduced after acute and <b>sub-chronic</b> treatment at all doses and virtually unchanged during abstinence; grooming was potently inhibited by acute treatment but potentiated by the <b>sub-chronic</b> one at doses of 50 and 100 µg kg(- 1), the effect of the higher dose persisting after 24 h and 7 days abstinence.

40|$|This thesis {{consisted}} of experiments designed {{to explore the}} construct of attention and investigate the disruptive effects of psychotomimetics, with a specific focus on NMDA antagonists. Phencyclidine (PCP) was administered {{through a variety of}} treatment regimens in order to to determine the ability of inducing cognitive-specific disruptions in attentional functioning. The hypothesis that <b>sub-chronic</b> exposure to PCP would result in persistent attentional impairment was tested, using the 5 -choice serial reaction time task (5 -CSRTT). The 5 -CSRTT assesses not only visuospatial attention, but also components of impulsivity, compulsivity, speed of processing and motivation. It was determined that an additional task-related intervention that increased the attentional load was required to elucidate attentional impairment following <b>sub-chronic</b> PCP treatment. The ability of rats to perform the modified version of the 5 -CSRTT, known as the 5 -choice continuous performance test (5 C-CPT), was investigated. The 5 C-CPT was implemented to provide a task that may have greater analogy to the human CPT, than the original 5 -CSRTT. The consequence of dopaminergic D 1 system activation was investigated. It was revealed that D 1 partial agonism improved attentional performance in a baseline-dependent manner. Following successful acquisition of the task, it was shown that repeated PCP treatment induced cognitive disruption that was cognitive-specific, and not confounded by generalised response disruption. Furthermore, a partial attenuation of the PCP-induced performance disruption was achieved following administration of the D 1 partial agonist, SKF 38393. Moreover, <b>sub-chronic</b> PCP treatment was shown to impair 5 C-CPT performance in the drug-free state. However, an additional challenge that further increased the attentional load was needed to elucidate a performance deficit. This highlighted that sustained attention/vigilance is sensitive to persistent impairment following <b>sub-chronic</b> PCP administration {{in a manner consistent with}} deficits observed in schizophrenia patients. This prompted the investigation that tested the hypothesis that <b>sub-chronic</b> PCP treatment could induce enduring structural deficits in regions associated with attentional performance. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was conducted, in conjunction with 5 -CSRTT and pre-pulse inhibition (PPI). It was revealed that <b>sub-chronic</b> PCP treatment resulted in morphological brain abnormalities in brain regions associated with 5 -CSRTT performance. This was coupled with deficits in sustained attentional performance following an increase in attentional load, yet PPI was unaffected. Taken together, these findings suggested <b>sub-chronic</b> PCP treatment impairs attentional functionality, an effect that dissociates between effortful and passive attentional processes...|$|E

The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate if this tolerance is related to changes in the expression of NOS or dopamine- 2 (D(2)) receptor or to a recovery of NOS activity. Male albino Swiss mice (25 - 30 g) received single or <b>sub-chronic</b> (once a day for 4 days) i. p. injections of saline or L-nitro-arginine (L-NOARG, 40 mg/kg), a non-selective inhibitor of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Twenty-four hours after the last injection, the animals were killed and their brains were removed for immunohistochemistry assay to detect the presence of nNOS or for `in-situ` hybridisation study using (35) S-labeled oligonucleotide probe complementary to D(2) receptor mRNA. The results were analysed by computerised densitometry. Independent groups of animals received the same treatment, but were submitted to the catalepsy test and had their brain removed to measure nitrite and nitrate (NOx) concentrations in the striatum. Acute {{administration of}} L-NOARG caused catalepsy that disappeared after <b>sub-chronic</b> treatment. The levels of NOx were significantly reduced after acute L-NOARG treatment. The decrease in NOx after drug injection suffered a partial tolerance after <b>sub-chronic</b> treatment. The catalepsy time after acute or <b>sub-chronic</b> treatment with L-NOARG was negatively (r = - 0. 717) correlated with NOx levels.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the acute and <b>sub-chronic</b> hypo-glycemic and antidiabetic effects of methanol extract from Cochlospermum vitifo-lium (MECv), a medicinal plant used in Mexican folk medicine for the treatment of hypertension, diabetes and liver damage-related diseases. Intragastric admin-istration of MECv (100 mg/Kg) induced a significant decrease on plasma glucose in normoglycemic and STZ-nicotinamide-induced diabetic rats in acute and <b>sub-chronic</b> models compared to control (p 5000 mg/Kg). Findings suggest that MECv might exert its hypoglycemic and anti-diabetic effect by extra-pancreatic action through both partial suppression of carbohydrate absorption on intestine lumen and acting as α-glucosidase inhibitor to reduce post-prandial rise of blood glucose...|$|E
40|$|Cognitive {{dysfunction}} is a core {{characteristic of}} schizophrenia, which can often persist when other symptoms, particularly positive symptoms, may be improved with drug treatment. The non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, phencyclidine (PCP), is a psychomotor stimulant drug {{that has been}} shown to induce symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia in humans and animals. The aim of these studies was to use the <b>sub-chronic</b> PCP model in rats to investigate cognitive dysfunction in behavioural tests which have been highlighted as relevance by the MATRICS initiative (MATRICS. ucla. edu). The main tests used were attentional set-shifting, operant reversal learning, and novel object recognition tasks. The pharmacology of antipsychotics was studied in the reversal learning task using receptor selective compounds. Following this, experiments were carried out using in vitro electrophysiology and in vivo microdialysis in an attempt to investigate the mechanisms underpinning the PCP-induced cognitive deficits. The attentional set-shifting task is a test of executive function, the extra-dimensional shift (EDS) phase relates to the ability to shift attention to a different stimulus dimension; this is impaired in patients with schizophrenia. The studies presented in chapter 2 showed that <b>sub-chronic</b> PCP administration impaired attentional set-shifting performance selectively in the EDS phase, a deficit which was significantly attenuated by <b>sub-chronic</b> administration of clozapine and risperidone, but not haloperidol. The effect of PCP was also shown to be more robust in female rats compared to males. A deficit in set-shifting ability was also observed in isolation reared rats. However, the deficits produced by PCP were more robust than the deficit produced by isolation rearing. The reversal learning task is another test of executive function. Chapter 3 reported that <b>sub-chronic</b> PCP administration impairs reversal learning ability in an operant task, as demonstrated by reduced percent correct responding in the reversal phase of the reversal learning task. It was found that a D 1 agonist (SKF- 38398), a 5 -HT 1 A partial agonist (buspirone), a 5 -HT 2 C antagonist (SB- 243213 A) and an agonist and positive allosteric modulator of the alpha 7 nACh receptor (PNU- 282987 and PheTQS respectively) are able to reverse the <b>sub-chronic</b> PCP-induced deficit in reversal learning. Although many antipsychotics have affinity for muscarinic M 1 and histamine H 1 receptors, selective agents at these receptors were not able to improve the PCP-induced deficit. In chapter 4, the atypical antipsychotics, clozapine and risperidone, when given alone to naïve rats had no effect on reversal learning. Haloperidol when given to naïve rats impaired performance at the highest dose. <b>Sub-chronic</b> PCP was again found to impair reversal learning performance. Investigative experiments revealed that the 2 min time-out could be important as a cue. Following a double reversal, olanzapine-treated rats lost the ability to switch between the rules, whereas clozapine and risperidone-treated rats could perform the double reversal. Experiments with the extended (15 min) reversal phase could allow the investigation of the time-course effects of antipsychotics or selective compounds. The studies presented in chapter 5 found a reduction in gamma oscillations in the CA 3 region of the hippocampus, following <b>sub-chronic</b> PCP treatment (2 - 5 weeks post treatment) that was paralleled by a deficit in parvalbumin immunoreactive (IR) cell density, at a similar time point (2 weeks post treatment). In contrast, a time-dependent increase in gamma oscillations was observed (6 - 8 weeks post treatment), at which point parvalbumin IR cell density was unchanged (8 weeks post treatment). Gamma oscillations were unchanged in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) following the PCP treatment regime. Locomotor activity tests were also carried out to ensure that the <b>sub-chronic</b> PCP treatment was successful. In-vivo microdialysis revealed that vehicle-treated rats show an increase in dopamine in the PFC which is selective for the retention trial of the novel object recognition task. PCP-treated rats were unable to distinguish between the novel and familiar objects and the increase in dopamine observed in vehicle rats was absent. As a control experiment it was also shown that <b>sub-chronic</b> PCP did not induce anxiety-like symptoms in the elevated plus maze and open field tests. 	 These studies suggest that <b>sub-chronic</b> PCP induces cognitive deficits in behavioural tasks, and these deficits may be due to GABAergic mediated processes in the hippocampus and dopaminergic dysfunction in the PFC. These behavioural and neurochemical results are concurrent to findings observed in schizophrenia...|$|E
40|$|Both {{acute and}} <b>sub-chronic</b> {{phencyclidine}} administration produce behavioural and pathophysiological changes that resemble some features of schizophrenia. The present study aimed {{to determine if}} acute and <b>sub-chronic</b> phencyclidine treatment in male rats produces deficits in sociability and social novelty preference, which may reflect aspects of the negative symptomatology observed in schizophrenia. Rats were treated with phencyclidine acutely (2 or 5 mg/kg) or subchronically (2 or 5 mg/kg bi-daily for one week followed by a one week wash-out period) or vehicle. Social affiliative behaviour was assessed using the sociability and preference for social novelty paradigm where social interaction time was measured in (a) a chamber containing an unfamiliar conspecific vs an empty chamber (sociability), or (b) a chamber containing an unfamiliar conspecific vs a chamber containing a familiar conspecific (preference for social novelty). Results showed that acute administration of phencyclidine produced a reduction in measures of sociability but {{had no effect on}} preference for social novelty while <b>sub-chronic</b> administration of phencyclidine had no effect on sociability or social novelty. This study provides further evidence for the usefulness of phencyclidine models in modelling the symptomatology of schizophrenia...|$|E
40|$|The {{extracts}} of Anacardium occidentale {{have been}} used in the management of different cardiovascular disorders in Nigeria. These have necessitated the assessment of the toxicity of this plant extract in <b>sub-chronic</b> administration. The inner stem bark of Anacardium occidentale was extracted with 80 % methanol and quantitatively analysed for antinutrients and some heavy metals. The phytochemical compositions and acute toxicity of the extract were determined also. Toxicity profiles of the extract on some liver function parameters were evaluated following a <b>sub-chronic</b> oral administration at doses of 1. 44 and 2. 87 g/kg. The phytochemical screening of extract revealed the presence of high amount of tannins, moderate saponins and trace of free reducing sugars. The antinutrient levels were 5. 75 % (tannins), 2. 50 % (oxalates), 2. 00 % (saponins), 0. 25 % (phytate) and 0. 03 % (cyanide). The quantity of iron detected from dried crude was 8. 92 mg/ 100 g, while lead and cadmium were non-detectable. The extract had LD 50 of 2. 154 g/kg p. o. in mice. <b>Sub-chronic</b> administration of the extract significantly increased the serum levels of alanine aminotransaminase and aspartate aminotransaminase, which are indicative of liver damage. The serum levels of alkaline phosphatase and total protein of the treated animals were not significantly increased. The effects of sub-chronically administered extract on hepatocytes were minimal as the serum alkaline phosphatase; total bilirubin and total protein levels in treated animals were not significant (p< 0. 05). Thus, <b>sub-chronic</b> administrations of Anacardium occidentale inner stem bark extract did not significantly (p< 0. 05) depress the function of hepatocytes in Wistar rats...|$|E
40|$|Effects of oral {{exposure}} to silver nanoparticles on the sperm of ratsIt {{has been demonstrated}} that {{exposure to}} silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) can induce toxicological effects in rodents. In this study, we investigated whether <b>sub-chronic</b> oral exposure to different doses of polyvinil pyrrolidone (PVP) -coated AgNPs (PVP-AgNPs) (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day) could induce harmful effects on epididymal sperm rat parameters. Sperm motility, viability and morphology were examined. Moreover, a histological evaluation of testis and epididymis was also performed. High doses of PVP-AgNPs showed higher sperm morphology abnormalities, while a progressive, but not significant effect, was observed in other sperm parameters. The current results suggest that oral <b>sub-chronic</b> exposure to PVP-AgNPs induces slight toxicological effects in sperm rat parameters. © 2016 Elsevier Inc...|$|E
