Perhaps more so, for I was some {{seven or eight years}} older, and less accustomed to changes, but even now I would far rather fight with my vizor up, save that one must have its protection when arrows or cross-bow bolts are flying; but as against other knights I would always keep it up; the helm itself and the cheek-pieces cover no small part of the face, and naught but a <b>straight</b> <b>thrust</b> could harm one, and I think I could trust my sword to ward that off. However, I have never yet had occasion to try. I have had more than one encounter with Eastern and African pirates during my voyages, but I have never taken my helmet with me on such journeys, and have not suffered by its loss." ...|$|E

It was a good cause in which I was to fight, and as soon as our swords crossed I felt how different it was to standing up against you, and that the ruffian knew little of sword-play. Twice I saw an opening for a <b>straight</b> <b>thrust,</b> but I had no desire to kill him, and waited until I could slash him across the face, and it needed but a few passes before I saw the opportunity." ...|$|E

The opposition can be done from any line, {{and it is a}} strong attack when done with a <b>straight</b> <b>thrust.</b> The amount of power needed to complete an opposition is just enough to carry the opponent's blade barely out of line, but not so much as to force it into a different line.|$|E
5000|$|A {{considerable}} {{portion of}} the introductory material covers the great changes in combat during World War I and World War II.

However, he also notes {{that there was an}} understanding {{on the part of the}} German command that much of the success of these strategies relied on rapid decision making. Boyd suggests that this is an example of their operating with a faster OODA loop. He then notes that there was a major difference between the impression of the blitzkrieg and the actual actions, that it appeared to be smooth and co-ordinated, illustrated with curving lines on maps, while in fact it was rarely a <b>straight</b> <b>thrust</b> and included many changes of direction.|$|E

50|$|The U.S. Army's Model 1913 cavalry saber had a large, basket-shaped hilt {{mounting}} a <b>straight,</b> double-edged, <b>thrusting</b> blade {{designed for use}} by heavy cavalry. Generally known as the “Patton” saber, after its designer Lieutenant (later General) George S. Patton, {{it may have been}} influenced by the British 1908 and 1912 Patterns. But Patton himself was predominantly influenced by French swordsmanship and French sword theory and design. Following the 1912 Olympics Patton went to France twice to study under French Master Swordsmen. His manual and cavalry sword use theories grew out of his training and experience in France.|$|R

40|$|Varus {{thrust of}} the knee is a {{clinical}} observation of an abrupt, excessive varus moment of the knee. A thrust occurs due {{to the opening of}} the lateral tibiofemoral compartment on initiation of load-bearing during normal gait. This phenomenon is mostly observed in varus-aligned knees with an abrupt increase of the preexisting varus align-ment. 6 Several anatomic structures stabilize the knee actively and passively against the varus thrust motion: the popliteal muscle-tendon, posterior joint capsule, iliotibial band, and lateral collateral ligament (LCL). It has been suggested that these posterolateral structures of the knee act as a unit to balance a varus moment. 10, 21 The LCL is the most important passive stabilizer against a <b>straight</b> lateral <b>thrust</b> force.

50|$|A {{sword is}} a bladed weapon {{intended}} for slashing or thrusting that {{is longer than}} a knife or dagger. The precise {{definition of the term}} varies with the historical epoch or the geographical region under consideration. A sword consists of a long blade attached to a hilt. The blade can be <b>straight</b> or curved. <b>Thrusting</b> swords have a pointed tip on the blade, and tend to be straighter; slashing swords have sharpened cutting edge on one or both sides of the blade, {{and are more likely to}} be curved. Many swords are designed for both thrusting and slashing.|$|R

50|$|The most {{impressive}} sign of Roman times in Tasburgh was and remains the trunk road running from south to north across the parish, now the A140 which runs from Norwich to Ipswich. The road was constructed to link important Roman towns at London and Colchester with {{the newly established}} capital of the Iceni, Venta Icenorum, which stood alongside the River Tas at Caistor St Edmund. Built {{in a series of}} <b>straight</b> alignments <b>thrust</b> remorselessly across existing field patterns it stood on a thirty feet wide embankment. The roadway itself was twenty feet wide with a steeply cambered surface of hard packed gravel. With little maintenance {{from the end of the}} Roman era in AD 410 to the building of a turnpike in 1768, the embankment and road surface were worn down and the road fell away from its straight alignment on hills, including Tasburgh Hill. Where the road follows its original course in the north of the parish we can imagine couriers of the Imperial Post galloping by, smart mule carts, merchant's pack horses, lumbering farm wagons delaying other traffic and weary pedestrians; all using the road for many of the same reasons that we do today.|$|R
50|$|The 1845 sword {{enjoyed a}} long service life {{and was used}} {{successfully}} in colonial wars all over the world, often winning the praise of British soldiers who used it to defend their lives. However, in 1892 proponents of the theory that thrust should be used exclusively over cutting for swords prevailed and the cut and thrust blade {{was replaced by a}} <b>straight</b> dedicated <b>thrusting</b> blade with a thick, fullered, dumbbell section and a sharp spear point. A stronger sword, unburdened by the design compromises of a requirement to cut well, this was a triumph of academic theory over real world experience, although good soldiers can make the best of whatever equipment is available (Robson reports on its good performance against the Dervishes in the Sudan. It was during the Sudan campaign when a young Winston Churchill sheathed his sword before the charge and used his then shockingly modern Mauser Broomhandle semiautomatic pistol). Ironically the infantry were finally being given a new weapon as rifled and repeating firearms had rendered them almost entirely obsolete so there has not been any reason to replace the model 1897 sword with its poor cutting ability since it has been used almost exclusively for ceremonial purposes almost from the time it was adopted.|$|R

His legs, confined in the stocks, were <b>thrust</b> <b>straight</b> out before him; but I suppose he was accustomed to uncomfortable positions, for he did not seem to mind it much. After sympathising with him in a general way, I asked him whether he could really sleep in that position.|$|R

But she could feel their turgid fleshy structure as in a sensuous vision, she KNEW how they rose out of the mud, she KNEW how they thrust out from themselves, how they stood stiff and succulent against the air.|$|R
50|$|After joining HAL, Ghatage was {{entrusted}} {{with the responsibility}} of developing a glider and he developed a droop-carrying glider.

The next project was HAL Pushpak, a piston engine twin seater aircraft which was followed by HAL Kiran, a jet trainer for the Indian Air Force. Later, he developed the prototype of the HAL Marut, a 2500 lb <b>thrust</b> <b>straight</b> jet engine aircraft. However, this project was later entrusted to Kurt Wolfgang Tank, a German aerospace engineer and Ghatage's team was moved to Germany to assist Tank.

5000|$|The {{fortress}} {{with the}} name Schenkenschans (Schenk's Sconce, Esquenque) was founded by the German mercenary commander Maarten Schenk van Nydeggen on the orders of stadtholder Adolf van Nieuwenaar in 1586. Its location was strategically chosen, because it dominated the place where in 1586 the Rhine and the Waal River forked (currently these rivers split further west; the fork was moved to improve river traffic and prevent flooding). An army that approaches from the east there had a choice of marching along the right bank of the Rhine, through the [...] "back door" [...] of the Dutch Republic, <b>thrusting</b> <b>straight</b> to the Dutch heartland; or taking a more southerly route through the Betuwe; or taking the third route west, entering the area between the Waal and the Meuse River. In all three cases the rivers formed an ideal supply line. However, that supply line was cut off by the Schenkenschans.|$|R

40|$|Many of the {{mountain}} belts displaying a curved shape are "oroclines", i. e. are produced after progressive bending of an originally <b>straight</b> fold and <b>thrust</b> belt. The bending process was previously explained {{as a consequence of}} several possible events taking place in the crustal orogenic wedge, such as occurrence of obstacles, non-coaxial deformation, and mouvements on wrench faults. Recent paleomagnetic results from the northern Apenninic Arc document that this belt is properly an orocline and results from Late Messinian-Early Pliocene bending of a Messinian straight belt-foredeep system. Tomographic images in turn show the presence of a high-velocity body, interpreted as subducted slab, in the upper mantle beneath the northern Apennines, between 35 and 670 km depth. Down to 100 km, this body displays an arcuate shape which closely mirrors the geological outlines, while it appears to be straight (and parallel to the Messinian pre-rotated belt) at depth. We explore here the possibility that the arcuate shape of the northern Apennines is a consequence, closely following in time, on much deeper processes than previously suggested, i. e. the lateral bending of the subducting Adriatic plate...|$|R
5000|$|Like in the {{original}} Asteroids {{the objective is to}} score as many points as possible by destroying asteroids and flying saucers. The asteroids come in three different sizes. If the player fires at and hits a large asteroid, it breaks into medium size asteroids. If the player fires at and hits a medium asteroid, it breaks into small asteroids. If a player fires at and hits a small asteroid, it disappears. Different points are awarded for hitting each size of asteroid, and for hitting flying saucers. The player controls a ship that can rotate left and right, fire shots <b>straight</b> forward, and <b>thrust</b> forward. Asteroids Deluxe replaces the hyperspace feature with shields which deplete with use. Other differences include asteroids which rotate and a new enemy which is dubbed a [...] "killer satellite" [...] which would, when shot, break apart into three smaller ships that homed in on the player's position. The screen of the game is wrapped both vertically and horizontally so that if any object moves past the top edge of the screen it reappears on the bottom edge at the same lateral location, and if it moves past {{the left side of the}} screen, it reappears on the right side of the screen in the same vertical location. Topologically, the screen is a torus.|$|R
60|$|The {{debate was}} wound {{up for the}} regular {{opposition}} by Sir Michael Hicks Beach, who was justly regarded throughout the session as having led his party with remarkable skill and judgment. Like the Irish leader, {{he seemed to be}} inspired by the occasion to a performance beyond his usual range, and he delivered the final charge with strong effect. The bill, he said, was the concoction of the prime minister and the Irish secretary, and the cabinet had no voice in the matter. The government had delayed the progress of the bill for a whole long and weary month, in order to give party wirepullers plenty of time in which to frighten waverers. To treat a vote on the second reading as a mere vote on a principle, without reference to the possibility of applying it, was a mischievous farce. Could anybody dream that if he supported the second reading now, he would not compromise his action in the autumn and would not be appealed to as having made a virtual promise to Ireland, of which {{it would be impossible to}} disappoint her? As for the bill itself, whatever lawyers might say of the theoretic maintenance of supremacy, in practice it would have gone. All this side of the case was put by the speaker with the <b>straight</b> and vigorous <b>thrust</b> that always works with strong effect in this great arena of contest.|$|R
60|$|The villains, though {{taken by}} surprise, were no cravens. Apparently {{they had already}} {{discharged}} their fire-arms, for only one fired at our hero with a pistol, and missed his aim. Flinging the weapon at his adversary with a yell of disappointment, he missed his aim a second time. At the same moment another of the band--one of the tallest and most ferocious-looking--sprang upon the youth with terrible fury. He knew well, apparently, how to use his weapon; and Lawrence felt that his experience at school now stood him in good stead. As the weapons of these giants flew around with rapid whirl and clash, the others stood aside to see the end. Doubtless they would have taken unfair advantage of their foe if they could, but Lawrence, turning {{his back to the}} wall, where Manuela crouched, prevented that. At last one dastardly wretch, seeing that his comrade was getting the worst of it, bethought him of his carbine, and began hurriedly to load. Our hero noted the act, and understood its fatal significance. With a bound like that of a tiger he sprang at the man, and cut him down with a back-handed blow, turning, even in the act, just in time to guard a sweeping cut dealt at his head. With a <b>straight</b> point he <b>thrust</b> his sword through teeth, gullet, and skull of his tall adversary, until it stood six inches out behind his head. Then, without a moment's pause, he leaped upon the nearest of the other bandits.|$|R
