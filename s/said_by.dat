5|$|Elsewhere, {{such as in}} the UK, hares are {{not always}} seen as pests, and there are species action plans aiming to {{significantly}} increase their numbers. Some coursers say that coursing assists conservation because it leads to sporting landowners creating a habitat suitable for hares. Opponents of coursing say that the converse is true, namely that coursing takes place where hares live rather than hares living where coursing takes place. It is also the case that coursing kills slower hares, and it is <b>said</b> <b>by</b> some coursers that this leaves faster hares to breed and multiply.|$|E
5|$|Oslac is <b>said</b> <b>by</b> the Historia Eliensis to {{have had}} a son named Thorth, that is, Thored.

5|$|The less-prominent women {{mentioned}} in the play are subordinated as well, as they are only described through {{the men of the}} play. Most of what is said about Sycorax, for example, is <b>said</b> <b>by</b> Prospero. Further, Stephen Orgel notes that Prospero has never met Sycorax – all he learned about her he learned from Ariel. According to Orgel, Prospero's suspicion of women makes him an unreliable source of information. Orgel suggests that he is sceptical of female virtue in general, citing his ambiguous remark about his wife's fidelity.|$|E
5|$|Under the Act, it is a {{contempt}} of Parliament to perform certain acts, for instance, to insult the Speaker or any Member of Parliament (MP) coming to or going from Parliament {{on account of}} his or her conduct in Parliament or of anything done or <b>said</b> <b>by</b> him or her in Parliament; or to publish any statement, whether in writing or otherwise, which falsely or scandalously defames, or which reflects on the character of, the Speaker or any MP touching on his or her conduct in Parliament or anything done or <b>said</b> <b>by</b> him or her in Parliament. It is presumably not open to a person charged with one of these offences to argue that it violates the Article 14 right to freedom of speech and expression. However, there is not yet any case law addressing this provision, and thus little guidance as to how the courts are to interpret the restriction.|$|E
5|$|A {{persistent}} myth of {{more recent}} origin {{is that of}} the Glastonbury Zodiac, a purported astrological zodiac of gargantuan proportions said to have been carved into the land along ancient hedgerows and trackways, in which the Tor forms part of the figure representing Aquarius. The theory was first put forward in 1927 by Katherine Maltwood, an artist with an interest in the occult, who thought the zodiac was constructed approximately 5,000 years ago. But {{the vast majority of the}} land <b>said</b> <b>by</b> Maltwood to be covered by the zodiac was under several feet of water at the proposed time of its construction, and many of the features such as field boundaries and roads are recent.|$|E

5|$|As a {{tropical}} depression, Neoguri (Ambo) brought heavy rainfall to many {{portions of the}} Philippines, including even Metro Manila. In Cebu City, the precipitation caused flooding, which forced 62people to evacuate their houses. In the Camotes Islands, rough waves capsized a motorboat with six passengers; five were rescued, with the other reported missing. But the storm at least alleviated {{for a few days}} the heat that has been experienced over Luzon from the past weeks. However, the storm did not stop the Palarong Pambansa (National Games in the Philippines) which was held in Puerto Princesa City in Palawan, one of the areas <b>said</b> <b>by</b> PAGASA to see stormy weather.|$|E
5|$|Asad was {{a member}} of the Qasr clan, a {{subtribe}} of the Banu Bajila. His great-grandfather, Asad ibn Kurz al-Qasri, is <b>said</b> <b>by</b> some traditions to have been the chief of the Bajila in the times of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and is counted as one of Muhammad's companions. Other traditions, hostile to the family, report that Asad was a Jew and a runaway slave. Asad's grandfather Yazid was an early and prominent supporter of the Umayyads in the First Fitna, while Asad's father Abdallah sided with Ibn al-Zubayr in the Second Fitna, but was eventually pardoned by the Caliph Abd al-Malik (reigned 685–705).|$|E
5|$|Bar Hemingway was the {{favourite}} bar of Ernest Hemingway and is <b>said</b> <b>by</b> {{some to be}} {{the birthplace}} of the Bloody Mary cocktail which was invented for him. However, the claim is disputed as Fernand Petiot claimed to have invented the drink in 1921 while working at Harry's New York Bar, a frequent Paris hangout for Hemingway and other American expatriates, rather than in the bar in the Ritz itself. The bar has been restored to its original appearance, with rich wood panelling and leather upholstery and has 25 original photographs on the walls taken by the author of places and people that inspired him.|$|E

5|$|Commencement weekend {{begins on}} Friday {{afternoon}} {{as members of}} the senior class gather in the upper church of Saint Anselm Abbey for the annual honors convocation. The senior academic honors convocation begins with an invocation, <b>said</b> <b>by</b> the Abbot of Saint Anselm Abbey, and is followed by the conferral of academic awards, read by the Dean of the College. Virtually every academic department has an award to present to a senior of that major. Next the President of the college awards each Summa Cum Laude graduate; within this elite group the Chancellor's medal is awarded to the graduate with the highest academic grade point average.|$|E
5|$|Donnchadh was <b>said</b> <b>by</b> the Martyrology of Glasgow to {{have died}} on 13 June 1250. He was succeeded in the earldom by Niall. The {{traditional}} view, {{going back to the}} 19th century, is that Niall was Donnchadh's son. This view has been undermined with more recent research by genealogist Andrew MacEwen, who has argued that Niall was not the son of Donnchadh, but rather his grandson, a view embraced by leading Scottish medievalist Professor G.W.S. Barrow. According to this argument, Donnchadh's son and intended heir was Cailean mac Donnchaidh (alias Nicholaus), who as his son and heir, issued a charter in Donnchadh's lifetime, but seemingly predeceased him. It was further suggested that Cailean's wife, Earl Niall's mother, was a daughter of the Tir Eoghain king Niall Ruadh Ó Neill, tying in with Donnchadh's Irish activities, accounting {{for the use of the}} name Niall, and explaining the strong alliance with the Ó Neill held by Niall's grandsons.|$|E
5|$|Eligible for salary {{arbitration}} for {{the first}} time, Posey signed a one-year, $8 million contract with the Giants prior to the 2013 spring training season. On March 29, Posey agreed to an eight-year contract extension worth $167 million, <b>said</b> <b>by</b> the Giants {{to be the most}} lucrative in franchise history. The contract wiped out three arbitration years and five years of free agency for Posey, locking in his services through the 2021 season with a club option for 2022. The agreement was the second largest in major league history for a catcher, exceeded only by that of Joe Mauer in 2010 with the Minnesota Twins.|$|E

Drawing on the support of the clergy of Cashel as well as his own {{military}} might, Feidlimid is <b>said</b> <b>by</b> Munster sources to have made himself King of Tara. Although he was defeated in 841 in battle with Niall Caille of the Cenél nEógain, the High King according to some, Feidlimid's achievements were exceptional. Not since Congal Cáech of the Dál nAraidi, King of Ulaid in the early 7th century, had any king but an Uí Néill one been reckoned King of Tara in any account.|$|E
5|$|Greyhounds were {{introduced}} in the Americas for sport and pleasure, they helped farmers control jackrabbits, and organised coursing meets were {{taking place in the}} United States in the 19th century, by 1886 according to Gulf Coast Greyhounds. Open field coursing of jackrabbits, which are members of the hare family, now takes place {{in a number of states}} in Western America, including California, Montana and Wyoming, and is <b>said</b> <b>by</b> the North American Coursing Association to take place also in Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah. It takes place with up to four dogs chasing the hare.|$|E
5|$|Henry was <b>said</b> <b>by</b> chroniclers to be good-looking, red-haired, freckled, {{with a large}} head; he had a short, stocky {{body and}} was bow-legged from riding. Often he was scruffily dressed. Not as {{reserved}} as his mother Matilda, nor as charming as his father Geoffrey, Henry was famous for his energy and drive. He was also infamous for his piercing stare, bullying, bursts of temper and, on occasion, his sullen refusal to speak at all. Some of these outbursts, however, may have been theatrical and for effect. Henry {{was said to have}} understood a wide range of languages, including English, but spoke only Latin and French. In his youth Henry enjoyed warfare, hunting and other adventurous pursuits; {{as the years went by}} he put increasing energy into judicial and administrative affairs and became more cautious, but throughout his life he was energetic and frequently impulsive.|$|E
