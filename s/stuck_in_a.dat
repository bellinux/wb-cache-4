5|$|After {{donating}} {{money to}} public television, Marge receives complimentary ballet tickets. She asks Homer to accompany her, {{and much to}} Marge's surprise he agrees, confusing ballet with a circus. On {{the day of the}} ballet, however, he inadvertently gets his arm <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> vending machine while trying to steal a can of soda from it and then gets his other arm <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> candy machine, and so is unable to attend the ballet. In disbelief about Homer's story, Marge invites her neighbor, Ruth Powers to attend with her. They both enjoy themselves and arrange to go out again the next night. Marge and Ruth's friendship annoys Homer, who feels Marge should be spending time with him instead. However, ignoring Homer's protests, Marge and Ruth visit bars and clubs in Springfield, and Ruth later shows Marge how to use a pistol.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{as he is}} {{planning}} to watch the season finale of MILF Island alone in his office, Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) gets <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> vending machine while trying to steal a candy bar. Pete's many attempts to break free from the machine end in failure when the machine ends up falling on him.|$|E

5|$|A {{teaser trailer}} has been {{released}} on 5 November 2012. The teaser shows Björk <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bed of quicksand, wearing a blue wig. The video was premiered at an exclusive screening at the MOCA Grand Avenue on November 12, 2012.

The channel also posted a behind-the-scenes video on the same day. The video features glimpses of filming and an interview with the director of the video, who explains the filming process.|$|E
5|$|De Hauteclocque {{broke his}} leg {{in two places}} in a fall from his horse in 1936. He told his company {{that it was his}} own fault for riding on the {{shoulder}} of the road. Thereafter he frequently walked with a cane. After another mishap involving losing his way during a tactical exercise and getting <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> field cordoned off with barbed wire, he told them that when you have done something really stupid, it is best to admit it.|$|E
5|$|Following an {{encounter}} with the rich and detestable Parta, who intends to take her as his second wife, Rasminah goes to the nearby city of Batavia (now Jakarta) to find a job. Several days later, having found work, she returns to Puncak to pick up Hadidjah and take her to Batavia. However, Parta and his cohort Doel are waiting in ambush. When Rasminah's carriage is <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rut, the two begin to chase after her. Rasminah runs into the woods and, after several close calls, finds shelter in a small house. There she rests the night, without seeing the owner.|$|E

5|$|If a large insect is {{struggling}} in a web, Portia does not usually take the insect, but waits {{for up to}} a day until the insect stops struggling, even if the prey is thoroughly stuck. When an insect <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> web owned by P. labiata, P. schultzi or any regional variant of P. fimbriata, and next to a web spider's web, the web spider sometimes enters the Portia′s web, and the Portia pursues and catches the web spider.|$|E

5|$|The episode centres on the team's {{attempts}} to broadcast a feature about an African athlete who {{is due to}} take part in his first race following recovery from a potentially career-ending injury. One of the two lead anchors on the show, Casey, is called up for having an unprofessional attitude on and off screen in the light of his recent divorce from his wife, and is even thinking of leaving the show.

5|$|The game follows Cocoro Fuyukawa and Satoru Yukidoh, who {{frequently}} experience {{a phenomenon that}} makes their minds switch place with each other, putting them in the other person's body. Cocoro is <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> blizzard in an emergency cabin on a mountain together with three other people, while Satoru is in an institute {{for the treatment of}} mentally ill criminals, having lost his memory. The player takes the role of Cocoro, and reads the story while occasionally making choices that affect the course of the story, attempting to keep her alive for seven days; after doing so, they are able to play through the seven days from Satoru's perspective as well.|$|E
5|$|Witherspoon's second love-triangle {{movie was}} the film {{adaptation}} of the 1930s circus drama Water for Elephants. She began circus training in March 2010 {{for her role as}} Marlena, a glamorous performer <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> marriage to a volatile husband (Christoph Waltz) but intrigued by the circus's new veterinarian (Robert Pattinson). The movie was filmed between late May and early August 2010 in various locations in Tennessee, Georgia, and California. It was released on April 22, 2011 and received mixed critical reviews.|$|E
5|$|A female P. labiata {{more often}} pursues small jumping spiders and web spiders than larger prey. While it more often catches small jumping spiders than larger ones, {{it is about}} equally {{effective}} with all sizes of web spiders up to twice P. labiata′s size. A female P. labiata is effective against insects up to twice P. labiata′s size when the insect is <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> non-salticid's web, and against insects not in webs and up to P. labiata′s size, while P. labiata seldom pursues or catches a larger insect in the open. A female P. labiata very seldom pursues or catches a larger insect in her own web, and is slightly less effective against smaller insects in P. labiata′s web than in other situations. Males are less efficient in all cases.|$|E

50|$|In the {{aftermath}} Mark and Cleo oversee {{shutting down the}} project, now deemed a failure. The final scene shows the Colonel <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> infinite loop, repeatedly reliving the moment the device detonates and engulfs him.|$|R
5|$|All Regulus {{species are}} almost {{exclusively}} insectivorous, preying on small arthropods with soft cuticles, such as springtails, aphids and spiders. They also {{feed on the}} cocoons and eggs of spiders and insects, and occasionally take pollen. All species will catch flying insects while hovering. Although the similarly sized goldcrest and firecrest are often found together, {{there are a number}} of factors that minimise direct competition for food. Goldcrests prefer smaller prey than common firecrests. Although both will take trapped insects from spider webs on autumn migration, firecrests will also eat the large orb-web spiders (on rare occasions kinglets have been found <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> spider web, either unable to move or dead).|$|E
5|$|Chaplin {{then shot}} the {{sequence}} where the Little Tramp first meets the millionaire and prevents him from committing suicide. During filming, Henry Clive suddenly {{decided that he}} did not want to jump into the tank of cold water in the scene, causing Chaplin to storm off the set and fire Clive. He was quickly replaced by Harry Myers, who Chaplin had known while under contract at Keystone Studios. Chaplin finished shooting the sequence on July 29, 1929 with exteriors at Pasadena Bridge. Chaplin then shot a sequence that was eventually cut from the film involving the Little Tramp attempting to retrieve a stick that was <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wall. The scene included a young Charles Lederer; Chaplin later praised the scene, but insisted that it needed to be cut. He then continued filming the scenes with the millionaire until September 29, 1929.|$|E
5|$|On the {{following}} loop, Crusher again has {{a feeling of}} déjà vu during the poker game, but when Data deals the next hand, all the cards are threes, followed by a hand where all players have three of a kind. The number 3 begins appearing throughout {{other parts of the}} ship's operations while, again, they determine they are <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> time loop. When they reach the anomaly and the ship appears from it, Data suddenly realizes that the 3 stands for the number of command pips on Riker's uniform, and executes Riker's option instead of his own. This allows Enterprise to safely clear the oncoming ship. The anomaly disappears and the time loop ends, and the crew realize they have been trapped in the loop for over 17 days, while the other ship, the USS Bozeman, has been missing for over 90 years. Picard welcomes the Bozemans crew to the 24th century.|$|E

5|$|Over two days, the Doctor {{attempts}} {{to adapt to}} human life. He learns about Craig, an office worker with little aspiration to move onward. Craig is <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> platonic relationship with his co-worker, Sophie. The Doctor becomes overly involved in Craig's life, becoming the star player in Craig's local football club, filling in {{for him at the}} call centre when Craig falls ill, and encouraging Sophie to follow her dream of travelling overseas to help animals. Craig, who has not yet professed his love for Sophie, becomes upset; he accosts the Doctor and demands that he leave, which forces the Doctor to reveal his history and his reason for being in the flat.|$|E
5|$|Post {{is where}} {{mainstream}} music could have gone. While modern chart music hasn't gone there entirely, Björk {{opened up the}} space for a more enigmatic and less readily labelled style; she undoubtedly helped broaden the playing field. Modern music still, regularly, finds itself, like a dinosaur <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tar pit, going nowhere and heading for extinction. Yet, there are pockets of air that artists like Björk - and those before her like Kate Bush - have pumped full of oxygen for the next generations of rare, raw and intense female talents - the Lordes and Sias of the world - to breath. In this way, the album title is a misnomer. Björk was a precursor rather than a late comer, less post than pre. Post stands today as {{a body of work}} that still informs the more marginal artistic fringes of modern music and reminds us how narrow and staid our world would be without outliers like Björk.|$|E
5|$|The {{third and}} most {{damaging}} attack developed at about 13:40. At least four bombs hit the ship's superstructure and caused heavy casualties among her 25mm anti-aircraft gun crews. Many near misses drove in her outer plating, compromising her defense against torpedoes. Most serious were four more torpedo impacts. Three exploded {{on the port}} side, increasing water flow into the port inner engine room and flooding yet another fireroom and the steering gear room. With the auxiliary steering room already under water, the ship lost maneuverability and became <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> starboard turn. The fourth torpedo most likely hit the starboard outer engine room, which, along with three other rooms on the starboard side, was being counterflooded to reduce the port list. The torpedo strike accelerated the rate of flooding and trapped many crewmen.|$|E
50|$|Metastability in {{electronics}} {{is usually}} {{seen as a}} problem. A changing circuit is supposed to settle into one of {{a small number of}} desired states, but if the circuit is vulnerable to metastability, it can get <b>stuck</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> undesirable state.|$|R
