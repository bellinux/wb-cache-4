30|$|In ray {{parenchyma}} {{cells from the}} previous year’s xylem to the eleventh annual ring from the cambium, some vacuoles contained proteins (Figs.  4, 5 b–d, 6 b–d). In general, cells of the vegetative and generative organs of plants contain protein storage vacuoles (PSVs) [29, 30]. Thus, the vacuoles that were <b>stained</b> <b>by</b> toluidine blue and amido black in {{ray parenchyma}} cells {{are likely to be}} PSVs. Hereafter, we use the abbreviation ‘PSV’ for a vacuole that was <b>stained</b> <b>by</b> toluidine blue and ‘non-PSV’ for a vacuole that was not <b>stained</b> <b>by</b> toluidine blue.|$|R
