40|$|<b>Simplifying</b> assumptions- {{everyone}} {{uses them}} but no one's programming tool explicitly supports them. In programming, {{as in other}} kinds of engineering design, <b>simplifying</b> assumptions are an important method for dealing with complexity. Given a complex programming problem, expert programmers typically choose <b>simplifying</b> assumptions which, though false, allow them to arrive rapidly at a program which addresses the important features of the problem without being distracted by all of its details. The <b>simplifying</b> assumptions are then incrementally retracted with corresponding modifications to the initial program. This methodology is particularly applicable to rapid prototyping because the main questions of interest can often be answered using only the initial program. <b>Simplifying</b> assumptions can easily be misused. In order to use them effectively two key issues must be addressed. First, <b>simplifying</b> assumptions should be chosen which <b>simplify</b> the design problem significantly without changing the essential character of the program which needs to be implemented. Second, the designer must keep track of all the assumptions he is making {{so that he can}} later retract them in an orderly manner. By explicitly dealing with these issues, a programming assistant system could directly support the use of <b>simplifying</b> assumptions as a disciplined part of the software development process...|$|R
40|$|In formal {{language}} theory {{the concept of}} <b>simplifying</b> words is considered {{in connection with the}} deciphering delay of codes (cf. [BP, Section II. 8], [LP]). In this paper we show that transferring a definition from the theory of iterated function systems (IFS) sheds some new light on <b>simplifying</b> words. : Formal languages may be considered as IFS in the Cantor space of infinite strings over a finite alphabet X (cf. [Fe], [S 2]). If those IFS satisfy the so-called Open Set Condition (OSC) then the underlying language is a code having <b>simplifying</b> words. Moreover, the <b>simplifying</b> words of a code C are naturally subdivided into nonsubwords (of the set of code messages C) and into <b>simplifying</b> prefixes. It can be shown that the existence of <b>simplifying</b> prefixes for a code C is equivalent to the fulfillment of a strong version of the OSC for the related IFS...|$|R
5|$|After {{working and}} {{training}} in Bolton and Manchester, Holden moved to London. His early buildings were influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement, {{but for most of}} his career he championed an unadorned style based on <b>simplified</b> forms and massing that was free of what he considered to be unnecessary decorative detailing. Holden believed strongly that architectural designs should be dictated by buildings' intended functions. After the First World War he increasingly <b>simplified</b> his style and his designs became pared-down and modernist, influenced by European architecture. He {{was a member of the}} Design and Industries Association and the Art Workers' Guild. He produced complete designs for his buildings including the interior design and architectural fittings.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} claimed that what <b>simplifies</b> {{parallelism}} can also <b>simplify</b> resilience. Based on that assertion, we present the Concurrent Collections programming model (CnC) {{as an ideal}} target for a simple yet powerful resilience system for parallel computations. Specifically, we claim that the same attributes that <b>simplify</b> reasoning about parallel applications written in CnC will similarly <b>simplify</b> {{the implementation of a}} checkpoint/restart system within the CnC runtime. We define these properties of CnC {{in the context of a}} model built in K. To demonstrate how these <b>simplifying</b> properties of CnC help to <b>simplify</b> resilience, we have implemented a simple checkpoint/restart system within Rice’s Habanero C implementation of the CnC runtime. We show how the CnC runtime can fully encapsulate the checkpointing and restarting processes, allowing application programmers to gain all the benefits of resilience without any added effort beyond implementing the application in CnC, while avoiding the synchronization overheads present in traditional techniques...|$|R

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the plutonium implosion-type nuclear weapon and the plutonium gun-type fission weapon, the uranium gun-type weapon was straightforward if not trivial to design. The concept was pursued so that {{in case of a}} failure to develop a plutonium bomb, it would still be possible to use the gun principle. The gun-type design henceforth had to work with enriched uranium only, and this allowed the Thin Man design to be greatly <b>simplified.</b> A high-velocity gun was no longer required, and a simpler weapon could be substituted. The <b>simplified</b> weapon was short enough to fit into a B-29 bomb bay.|$|E
