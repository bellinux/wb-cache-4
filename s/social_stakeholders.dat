40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine, drawing on {{organization}} studies and stakeholder theories, the organizational configuration that enables the social enterprise to succeed by combining social and economic imperatives in a sustainable way. Design/methodology/approach – The research project is based on the analysis of a multiple cross-national case study consisting of seven social enterprises that are active in the drug rehabilitation context. Multiple rounds of data gathering and analysis combined with within-case analysis and cross-case comparison enabled the authors to evaluate the perceived, declared and subjective organizational perspectives. Findings – Results suggest that organizational performance – measured as the ability to achieve social goals, generate resources and pursue sustainability over time – depends on the implementation of a participative organizational configuration defined by the interaction of six organizational components (i. e. time and space designed for collective activities, low degree of formalization, social control, centralized decision-making processes, transformational leadership style and a workforce structure based on <b>social</b> <b>stakeholders</b> as workers). The involvement of <b>social</b> <b>stakeholders</b> emerges as a distinctive feature in the social enterprise domain.

40|$|Background Sustaining {{integrated}} care is difficult, {{in large}} part because of problems encountered securing the participation of health care and social service professionals and, in particular, general practitioners (GPs). Purpose To present an innovative bottom-up and pragmatic strategy used to implement a new integrated care model in France for community-dwelling elderly people with complex needs. Results In the first step, a diagnostic study was conducted with face-to-face interviews to gather data on current practices from a sample of health and <b>social</b> <b>stakeholders</b> working with elderly people. In the second step, an integrated care model called Coordination Personnes Agées (COPA) was designed by the same major stakeholders in order to define its detailed characteristics based on the local context. In the third step, the model was implemented in two phases: adoption and maintenance. This strategy was carried out by a continuous and flexible leadership throughout the process, initially with a mixed leadership (clinician and researcher) followed by a double one (clinician and managers of services) in the implementation phase. Conclusion The implementation of this bottom-up and pragmatic strategy relied on establishing a collaborative dynamic among health and <b>social</b> <b>stakeholders.</b> This enhanced their involvement throughout the implementation phase, particularly among the GPs, and allowed them to support the change practices and services arrangements...|$|E

30|$|CSR is {{considered}} as a broad term, such that an exhaustive or conclusive definition remains non-existent.

For instance, an earlier definition of CSR by Carroll (1979) highlights four facets of CSR, which include economic, legal, ethical, and discretionary.

The alignment of resources and capabilities in accordance with social good, characteristic of the Social Economy, will furnish the ontological perspective of the Stakeholder Theory with a stronger grounding, distancing it from the instrumental perspective. It will also imbue it with a special concern for the social pole, frequently relegated in favour of other <b>stakeholders.</b> Rooting the <b>Social</b> Economy within the Stakeholder Theory makes at least three significant contributions to the former.

40|$|In many {{approaches}} to social enterprise, researches focus on strategic and entrepreneurial issues. We {{turn the tables}} and we adopt the organizational theory perspective to suggest the design and {{the implementation of the}} Human Resource Management (HRM) practices to engage the different types of stakeholders in the social enterprise domain. Combining the stakeholder relationship approach and the social exchange theory, we propose a stakeholder configuration model for the social enterprise domain. Our discussion enables us to identify four different kinds of organization-stakeholder relationships, characterized by different types of stakeholder engagement; the first three kinds refer to the links with the actual stakeholders; the last one is about the possible future stakeholder liaisons. Each kind of relationship advocates a specific bundle of HRM practices to sustain the specific engagement types. An exemplary case study preliminarily confirms and explains our theoretical model. The research is based on the study of an emblematic Italian social enterprise, the Cometa Foundation, operating in the care, support and educations of disadvantaged children and young people. Cometa is well known in Italy as one of the emerging and most successful organization in the field and it is receiving more and more attention from public opinion and government. From a theoretical point of view, our results confirm the social enterprise field as a relevant domain to stretch both stakeholder and organization theories. From the stakeholder perspective, our data allow us to identify specific social stakeholder categories, and they challenge the traditional distinction between external vs. internal stakeholders. From the organization theory perspective, we propose an extension of the HRM architecture approach to different types of stakeholders other than employees, and our results support the configurational approach to the social enterprise people management. From a managerial point of view, our initial evidence provides new insights to help social entrepreneurs, social managers and practitioners to deliberately recognize the strategic role of the <b>social</b> <b>stakeholders</b> and to activate practices to deal simultaneously with them, according to their characteristics and {{to the nature of the}}ir relationship (i. e. engagement) with the social enterprise. The <b>social</b> <b>stakeholders,</b> such as social clients and volunteers, are more similar to internal employees than to external parties. Therefore we suggest that some HRM practices (usually reserved to the internal stakeholders, such as training and career systems) can be effectively extended to the <b>social</b> <b>stakeholders.</b> Moreover, different bundles of HRM practices are suggested for the other stakeholder categories according to the nature of the engagement that characterizes their relationships with the social enterprise...|$|E

This suggests that enhancing energy security by way of deploying novel energy technologies such as shale gas fracking is not simply a function of resource endowments and technological progress.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to explore the emerging practice of CSR in Bangladesh. As this is the first comprehensive study of CSR in Bangladesh it is primarily exploratory in nature. Using the lens of stakeholder theory the study examines whether the current practice of CSR in Bangladesh is motivated by a desire to discharge accountability to all relevant stakeholders or is mainly driven by the imperative of strategic management of powerful stakeholders only with a view to advancing corporate economic interests. In investigating this question, a qualitative analysis of corporate social disclosures is made in order to examine corporate attitudes towards social, ethical and environmental issues as represented in the texts of annual reports. The sample of reports analysed comprises 79 top listed companies (including six multinationals) as well as eight public sector companies under the control of Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC). In addition to this analysis of published reports 34 semi-structured interviews with managers and stakeholder groups have been carried out to critically examine their perceptions towards the phenomenon of CSR in Bangladesh. The results of the study show that Bangladeshi companies make very few social disclosures. The majority of the companies studied do not address the crucial issues of corruption, child labour, equal opportunities and poverty alleviation. Analysis of disclosures indicates that companies attach far more importance to the economically dominant stakeholders such as, shareholders, customers and employees ignoring the rights of <b>social</b> <b>stakeholders</b> such as local community, natural environment and the wider society. The interviews with managers emphasised the paramount importance of strategic management of key economic stakeholders. Interviews with various stakeholder groups suggest that they view the corporate response to social, ethical and environmental issues as essentially cosmetic and part of a public relations campaign. While both the managerial group and the stakeholder groups indicated a belief that CSR would increase in future, inter alia, the driving force behind such increase appears to be strong pressure from `outside' forces such as parent companies of multinationals, international buyers and international agencies. The study concludes that in their pursuit of CSR corporations are basically motivated by their desire to strategically manage their key powerful stakeholders.
