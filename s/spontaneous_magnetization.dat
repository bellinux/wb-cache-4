5|$|Magnetism as a {{property}} of matter {{has been known}} in China since 4000 BC. However, the first modern studies of magnetism only started {{with the development of}} electrodynamics by Faraday, Maxwell and others in the nineteenth century, which included classifying materials as ferromagnetic, paramagnetic and diamagnetic based on their response to magnetization. Pierre Curie studied the dependence of magnetization on temperature and discovered the Curie point phase transition in ferromagnetic materials. In 1906, Pierre Weiss introduced the concept of magnetic domains to explain the main properties of ferromagnets. The first attempt at a microscopic description of magnetism was by Wilhelm Lenz and Ernst Ising through the Ising model that described magnetic materials as consisting of a periodic lattice of spins that collectively acquired magnetization. The Ising model was solved exactly to show that <b>spontaneous</b> <b>magnetization</b> cannot occur in one dimension but is possible in higher-dimensional lattices. Further research such as by Bloch on spin waves and Néel on antiferromagnetism led to developing new magnetic materials with applications to magnetic storage devices.|$|E

Based on the mean field approximation, the Curie-Weiss temperature TCW = 0 is suggested as the phase boundary between the SSG systems and the SFM systems, which is convinced by the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>magnetizations</b> and relaxations.

The network of interactions is the √(3) ×√(3) type; the interactions are continuously controlled between the undistorted triangular lattice and the dice lattice. We find new states between the nonmagnetic 120 -degree-structured {{state of the}} undistorted triangular case and the up-up-down state of the dice case.

This indicates the length-directing effect of the polyammoniums. The dynamic movements of polyammoniums between favored sites or orientations within the cavities lead to slow dielectric relaxations.

40|$|First-order {{reversal}} curve (FORC) diagrams {{have become}} a standard tool in rock magnetism, yet magnetite is the only magnetic mineral that is well characterized using FORC diagrams. We present FORC diagrams for predominantly single-domain (SD) synthetic aluminous hematite (?-Fe 2 -xAlxO 3) and goethite (?-(FeAl) OOH) and natural greigite (Fe 3 S 4) and pyrrhotite (Fe 7 S 8) to constrain interpretation of FORC diagrams from natural samples. Hematite and goethite have low <b>spontaneous</b> <b>magnetizations</b> and negligible magnetic interactions, while greigite and pyrrhotite have higher <b>spontaneous</b> <b>magnetizations</b> and can have strong magnetic interactions. The coercivity of hematite systematically increases with Al content only for samples produced using the same synthesis method, but it is variable for samples produced with different methods even for similar Al content. This precludes use of magnetic coercivity alone to quantify the Al content of natural hematites. Goethite has much higher coercivity than hematite for all measured samples. SD and superparamagnetic (SP) behavior is common in natural greigite samples, with peak coercivities ranging from ~ 70 mT (SD) to zero (SP). This range overlaps with that of lower-coercivity minerals, which can make greigite identification ambiguous at room temperature. Fine-grained SD pyrrhotite has slightly higher coercivities than greigite, which progressively decreases with increasing grain size within the SD size range and overlaps the range for greigite. While FORC diagrams are useful for magnetic characterization, care is needed in interpretation because of overlaps in {{the broad range of}} magnetic properties, which result from variations in domain state, for any magnetic mineral with respect to other minerals...|$|R

2500|$|In {{addition}} to being nonlinear, ferroelectric materials demonstrate a spontaneous nonzero polarization (after entrainment, see figure) even when the applied field E is zero. The distinguishing feature of ferroelectrics is that the spontaneous polarization can be reversed by a suitably strong applied electric field in the opposite direction; the polarization is therefore dependent {{not only on the}} current electric field but also on its history, yielding a hysteresis loop. [...] They are called ferroelectrics by analogy to ferromagnetic materials, which have <b>spontaneous</b> <b>magnetization</b> and exhibit similar hysteresis loops.|$|E

40|$|Majorana fermions {{are often}} {{proposed}} {{to be realized}} by first singling out a single non-degenerate Fermi surface in spin-orbit coupled systems, and then imposing boundaries or defects. We take a different route starting with two degenerate Fermi surfaces without spin-orbit coupling. By the method of "boundary of boundary", both the zero energy Majorana modes and the dispersive chiral ones are formed in superconducting systems with the mixed p± is pairings. Their surfaces develop <b>spontaneous</b> <b>magnetizations</b> with directions determined by the boundary orientations and the phase difference between the p and s-component gap functions.

The effective moments and spontaneous moments are compared with those calculated on the assumption of local moments on both magnetic subnetworks, and assuming various spin structures.

40|$|ZrMnP and HfMnP single {{crystals}} {{are grown}} by a self-flux growth technique and structural {{as well as}} temperature dependent magnetic and transport properties are studied. Both compounds have an orthorhombic crystal structure. ZrMnP and HfMnP are ferromagnetic with Curie temperatures around 370 K and 320 K respectively. The <b>spontaneous</b> <b>magnetizations</b> of ZrMnP and HfMnP are determined to be 1. 9 μ_B/f. u. and 2. 1 μ_B/f. u. respectively at 50 K. The magnetocaloric effect of ZrMnP in term of entropy change (Δ S) {{is estimated to be}} - 6. 7 kJm^- 3 K^- 1 around 369 K. The easy axis of magnetization is [100] for both compounds, with a small anisotropy relative to the [010] axis. At 50 K, the anisotropy field along the [001] axis is ∼ 4. 6 T for ZrMnP and ∼ 10 T for HfMnP. Such large magnetic anisotropy is remarkable considering the absence of rare-earth elements in these compounds. The first principle calculation correctly predicts the magnetization and hard axis orientation for both compounds, and predicts the experimental HfMnP anisotropy field within 25 percent. More importantly, our calculations suggest that the large magnetic anisotropy comes primarily from the Mn atoms suggesting that similarly large anisotropies may be found in other 3 d transition metal compounds...|$|R

40|$|First-order {{reversal}} curve (FORC) diagrams for {{mixtures of}} different magnetic phases and bimodal distributions have been measured {{to examine the}} efficiency of the FORC method at unraveling complex magnetic signals. The FORC distributions for various magnetic minerals, including magnetite, maghemite, hematite, and goethite, and their linear additivity are assessed. Mixtures containing only hard magnetic minerals like hematite or goethite, which have relatively small <b>spontaneous</b> <b>magnetizations</b> (MS) and large magnetocrystalline anisotropies, can be adequately described by a linear addition of the two end-members, because there are virtually no magnetostatic interactions between the phases. Mixtures dominated by softer minerals like magnetite and maghemite are more susceptible to interactions and exhibit nonlinear behavior. When a hard phase with low MS like hematite is mixed with a softer phase with high MS like magnetite, it can still be identified using the FORC technique, whereas it is impossible to do so using standard magnetic hysteresis measurements. When the weaker phase can be identified, then weak-strong mixes add linearly; however, beyond a certain critical concentration the mineral with high MS swamps the magnetic signal and linearity breaks down. It is suggested that the FORC method is highly suitable for identifying small traces of hard magnetic minerals like hematite and goethite in the presence of minerals with high MS such as magnetite...|$|R
