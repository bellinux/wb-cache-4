25|$|This same trip proved tragic as both of Elisabeth's {{children}} {{became ill}} with diarrhea. While Gisela recovered quickly, two-year-old Sophie grew steadily weaker, then died. It is generally assumed today that {{she died of}} typhus. Her death pushed Elisabeth, who was already prone to bouts of melancholy, into periods of heavy depression, which would haunt her {{for the rest of}} her life. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> her living daughter, began neglecting her, and their relationship never recovered.|$|E
500|$|Recent historians, however, hold to the German {{account of}} the ship's sinking. Black Prince briefly engaged the German {{battleship}} [...] at about 23:35 GMT, scoring two hits with 6-inch shells. Separated {{from the rest of}} the British fleet, Black Prince approached the German lines at approximately midnight. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the German battleships, but it was too late. The German battleship [...] fixed Black Prince in her searchlights and opened fire. Up to five other German ships, including the battleships , , and , joined in the bombardment, with return fire from Black Prince being ineffective. Most of the German ships were between [...] of Black Prince — effectively point-blank range for contemporary naval gunnery. The ship was hit by at least twelve heavy shells and several smaller ones, sinking within 15 minutes. There were no survivors from her crew, all 857 being killed.|$|E
500|$|Almost {{blind and}} unable to {{effectively}} fire her main and secondary armament, South Dakota was illuminated by searchlights and targeted by gunfire and torpedoes {{by most of the}} ships of the Japanese force, including Kirishima, beginning around midnight on 15 November. Although able to score a few hits on Kirishima, South Dakota took 26 hits—some of which did not explode—that completely knocked out her communications and remaining gunfire control operations, set portions of her upper decks on fire, and forced her to try to steer away from the engagement. All of the Japanese torpedoes missed. Admiral Lee later described the cumulative effect of the gunfire damage to South Dakota as to, [...] "render one of our new battleships deaf, dumb, blind, and impotent." [...] South Dakotas crew casualties were 39killed and 59wounded, and <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the battle at 00:17 without informing Admiral Lee, though observed by Kondo's lookouts.|$|E

500|$|In {{the last}} year of her life, Austen revised Northanger Abbey (1817), wrote Persuasion (1817), and began another novel, {{eventually}} titled Sanditon, which was left unfinished at her death. Austen did not have time to see Northanger Abbey or Persuasion through the press, but her family published them as one volume after her death and her brother Henry included a [...] "Biographical Notice of the Author". This short biography sowed the seeds for the myth of Austen as a quiet, retiring aunt who wrote during her spare time: [...] "Neither the hope of fame nor profit mixed with her early motives...o much did she shrink from notoriety, that no accumulation of fame would have induced her, had she lived, to affix her name to any productions of her [...] public <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> any allusion to the character of an authoress." [...] However, this description is in direct contrast to the excitement Austen shows in her letters regarding publication and profit: Austen was a professional writer.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1890, Burnett's {{oldest son}} Lionel died from {{consumption}} in Paris, which greatly affected {{her life and}} her writing. Before his death, she sought a cure from physicians {{and took him to}} Germany to visit spas. After his death, before she sank into a deep depression, she {{wrote in a letter to}} a friend that her writing was insignificant in comparison to having been the mother of two boys, one of whom died. At this time <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> her traditional faith in the Church of England and embraced Spiritualism and Christian Science. [...] She returned to London, where she sought the distraction of charity work and formed the Drury Lane Boys' Club, hosting an opening in February 1892. Also during this period she wrote a play with a starring role for Stephen Townsend in an attempt to begin his acting career. After a two-year absence from her Washington, D.C. home, her husband, and her younger son, Burnett returned there in March 1892, where she continued charity work and began writing again. [...] In 1893, Burnett published an autobiography, devoted to her eldest son, titled The One I Knew Best of All. Also in that year, she had a set of her books displayed at the Chicago World Fair.|$|E

60|$|GLORIA. I do {{not know}} you well enough, Mr. Valentine, to have any opinion {{on the subject of}} your {{personal}} merits. (<b>She</b> <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> him with infinite indifference, and sits down with her book on the garden seat.) I do not think the conditions of marriage at present are such as any self-respecting woman can accept.|$|R
60|$|GLORIA. Oh, {{nothing of}} any consequence. (<b>She</b> <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> them and {{goes up to}} the easy chair at the fireplace, where she sits down, almost {{with her back to}} them. As they wait expectantly, she adds, over her shoulder, with studied indifference.) On board the steamer the first officer did me the honor to propose to me.|$|R
60|$|There is {{a figure}} we know well, {{just come out}} of the house, and shading her eyes with her hands as she looks for {{something}} in the distance, for the rays that fall on her white borderless cap and her pale auburn hair are very dazzling. But now <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the sunlight and looks towards the door.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> {{him to the}} clerk, {{and pointed}} to another door.|$|E

50|$|Despite her victory, Vanessa is more lonely than ever. She {{offers her}} love to Ethan, but he refuses and turns {{himself into the}} police.

60|$|He {{was very}} angry and very rude. <b>She</b> merely <b>turned</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> him in disdain. He walked {{whistling}} down the room, flirted and laughed with Hilda.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> {{him with}} an {{imperious}} gesture of dismissal. Esterbrook Elliott stepped forward and caught one firm, white wrist.|$|E

6000|$|But {{she threw}} back her head, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> impatiently <b>away</b> <b>from</b> him. [...] "Oh, I needn't tell you! She knows enough. Besides," [...] she went on, [...] "she doesn't believe us." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> him. The little {{gesture with}} which she refused to see his hand seemed {{to be one of}} dismissal.|$|E

50|$|She {{exhibited}} {{with the}} London Group in 1916, but <b>from</b> 1920 <b>she</b> increasingly <b>turned</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the avant-garde and adopted a more realist style, working in still life, landscapes and portraiture, and latterly exhibiting with the Holborn Art Society.|$|R

60|$|Then, <b>turning,</b> <b>she</b> walked <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the feasters, upon {{whom there}} fell a certain hush.|$|R
50|$|A {{couple of}} months later, the first two daughters are marrying their fiancés at Tschöll's house, and the three {{roommates}} are all guests at the wedding. Actress Giuditta Grisi, the mistress of Baron Franz Schober, one of Schubert's friends, arrives. She is jealous and believes {{that he must be}} cheating on her. She assumes that Hannerl is the other woman and warns her to stay <b>away</b> <b>from</b> her man. Schubert, still too unable to tell Hannerl that he loves her, instead asks Schober to sing a song that he has written for her ("Ungeduld"). Hannerl misunderstands Grisi's warning, believing it to be about Schubert rather than Schober. <b>She</b> <b>turns</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the composer and falls in love with Schober.|$|R
