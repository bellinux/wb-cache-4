40|$|Abstract: Following the {{implementation}} of a uniform system for processing structural business statistic s (IMPECT 1), Statistics Netherlands has applied a similar approach for dealing with <b>short-term</b> <b>statistics</b> (IMPECT 2). Again, harmonization and efficiency (economies of scale and selective editing) have been the key words. Although the number of variables is much smaller than in structural business statistics, the complexity of developing a new system for the <b>short-term</b> <b>statistics</b> has proven to be nonetheless substantial. Calculating a reliable growth rate and processing data as efficiently as possible requires not only a well thought-out methodological concept but also a well-oiled data-handling process.

40|$|Two {{important}} functionalities {{in cognitive}} networking are network detection and recognition. Previous investigations showed that MAC sub-layer technology-specific features may offer {{a simple and}} direct way of performing such tasks; in particular, they allow to by-pass complex physical layer feature extraction based on a simple energy detection scheme, capable of producing a time-varying profile reflecting the presence vs. absence of packets over the air interface.

40|$|Abstract: Statistics Belgium {{set up an}} {{outbound}} call centre for the collection of output prices by way of computer-assisted telephone interviewing; the software used is the CATI-module of Blaise. Telephone interviewing was chosen because it allows very rapid data collection, which is crucial for output prices information. Another limiting factor for data availability, however, is {{the time and effort}} spent in checking for errors. Blaise-CATI can solve this problem: newly introduced prices can immediately be evaluated against other information and, when falling outside preset boundaries, be verified with respondents still on line. A practically error-free input can be guaranteed this way. The present paper explains how automatic quality checking of input is implemented in the Statistics Belgium application of Blaise-CATI for collecting output prices and how these can be used to efficiently calculate output price indices, required by the Eurostat regulation for <b>short-term</b> <b>statistics.</b> I...|$|E

Such a {{system can be}} of great use to scene analysis and understanding based on the acoustic modality. The performance of three feature sets based on Mel filterbank, MPEG- 7 audio protocol, and wavelet decomposition is assessed. Furthermore we explore the application of temporal integration using the following three different strategies: (a) <b>short-term</b> <b>statistics,</b> (b) spectral moments, and (c) autoregressive models. The experimental setup is thoroughly explained {{and based on the}} concurrent usage of professional sound effects collections. In this way we try to form a representative picture of the characteristics of ten sound classes. During the first phase of our implementation, the process of audio classification is achieved through statistical models (HMMs) while a fusion scheme that exploits the models constructed by various feature sets provided the highest average recognition rate. The proposed system not only uses diverse groups of sound parameters but also employs the advantages of temporal feature integration.|$|E

40|$|A {{framework}} for downscaling precipitation from RCM projections {{to the high}} resolutions {{in time and space}} required in the urban hydrological climate change impact assessment is outlined and demonstrated. The basic approach is that of Delta Change, developed for both continuous and event-based applications. In both cases, Delta Change Factors (DCFs) are calculated which represent the expected future change of some key precipitation statistics. In the continuous case, short-term precipitation from climate projections are analysed in order to estimate DCFs associated with different percentiles in the frequency distribution of non-zero intensities. The DCFs may then be applied to an observed time series, producing a realisation of a future time series. The event-based case involves downscaling of Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves based on extreme value analysis of annual maxima using the Gumbel distribution. The resulting DCFs are expressed as a function of duration and frequency (i. e. , return period) and may be used to estimate future design storms. The applications are demonstrated in case studies focusing on the expected changes in <b>short-term</b> precipitation <b>statistics</b> until 2100 in the cities of Linz (Austria) and Wuppertal (Germany).

40|$|For {{policymakers and}} other users of {{official}} statistics, {{it is crucial}} to distinguish real differences underlying statistical outcomes from noise caused by various error sources in the statistical process. This has become more difficult as official statistics are increasingly based upon a mix of sources that typically do not involve probability sampling. In this article, we apply a resampling method to assess the sensitivity of mixed-source statistics to sourcespecific classification errors. Classification errors can be seen as coverage errors within a stratum. The method can be used to compare relative accuracies between strata and releases, it can assist in deciding how to optimally allocate resources in the statistical process, and it can be applied in evaluating potential estimators. A case study on <b>short-term</b> business <b>statistics</b> shows that bias occurs especially for those strata that deviate strongly from the mean value in other strata. It also suggests that shifting classification resources from small and mediumsized enterprises to large enterprises has virtually no net effect on accuracy, because the gain in precision is offset by the creation of bias.
