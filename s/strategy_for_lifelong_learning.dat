Aiming at a profile of future strategies, major recent findings and internationally debated policy issues are brought together along the following five lines: First, empirical results on Austrian continued education (participation, finances, etc.), though frequently insufficient or contradictory, are surveyed. Relevant structural elements and points of contention are outlined. Second, approaches within the National Action Plan framework of 1998 and 1999 are scrutinized. Third, {{the development of the}} most important international <b>strategies</b> <b>for</b> <b>Lifelong</b> <b>Learning</b> and principal criticisms are recapitulated. Fourth, political consequences of market failure, problems related to financing options, and tensions between the short and long time perspective are identified as the predominant issues in recent research.

40|$|This paper reviews UK employer's {{provision}} of <b>lifelong</b> <b>learning.</b> It opens with {{an overview of}} the concept of the learning organisation and the barriers that {{stand in the way of}} its adoption, arguing that relatively few UK organisations have or are about to becoming learning organisations.

40|$|In an era {{of ongoing}} change, {{workplace}} learning has taken on an increasingly popular role as a vehicle through which organizations can achieve their long-term goals and strategic visions. Informal learning at work has become an extremely important issue and Managers and HRD practitioners have attempted to deploy informal learning {{in the design of}} corporate cultures. Empirical Research on Informal Learning The term informal learning was first introduced in 1950 by Malcolm Knowles, in his pioneer work “Informal Adult Education”. Since that time, many authors have written about informal learning, offering their unique perspective on the meaning of the term. Nevertheless the broad spectrum of leading theoretical models and used methods in terms of case study, ethnographic, interview and survey approaches, no single theoretical model or methodological approach has yet established dominance. What is now needed is some typology or organizing tool for understanding the different types of informal learning and how these events might be connected to the more formal training undertaken by the worker. Objectives of the study This report presents the findings from a study carried out by the NBU, SM between October 2008 and September 2009. (This study is {{the first of its kind}} for the Bulgarian environment). The aims of the study were to illustrate the range of practice of informal learning at work, to provide an analysis of these practices in some private companies in Bulgaria in order to propose ways to target case study material at a business audience. More specifically, the research examined: the types of informal learning activities people engage in at work and perceived factors that affect informal learning engagement.

40|$|Pharmacy {{education}} is provided for in Ireland by three Higher Education Institutions; The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), University of Dublin, Trinity College (TCD), and University College Cork (UCC). TCD {{was the sole}} provider of the undergraduate programme from 1977 until 2002 when the School of Pharmacy RCSI opened. The Schools educate approximately 150 students per annum. Applications to study pharmacy are far {{in excess of the}} places available as demand is high, and the profession is therefore fortunate to attract students of high calibre. There {{have been a number of}} recent developments which have transformed the landscape of pharmacye ducation and training in Ireland. The Bologna declaration, for instance, prompted curriculum reform in the Schools with RCSI completely reforming in 2005 to be fully compliant. One of the main drivers for development has been the Pharmacy Act 2007, which conferred responsibility ont he Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI), the pharmacy regulator, for overseeing education, training and lifelong learning in pharmacy. The PSI recently commissioned The Review of Pharmacy Education and Accreditation (PEARs) Project, a Review of International CPD Models, a review of competency frameworks and a baseline survey of standards in practice. These are intended to inform undergraduate curriculum development and a <b>strategy</b> <b>for</b> <b>lifelong</b> <b>learning.</b> The primary recommendation of the PEARs report([URL] is that “the current 4 + 1 model of pharmacy education to first registration should be replaced by a five year fully integrated programme of education, training and assessment as the basis for application for registration as a pharmacist. ” This report will instigate major curriculum reform in the Higher Education Institutions imminently. The Review of International CPD Models([URL]) set forth a vision for continuing professional development provision that will be implemented by 2014, as mandated by the Pharmacy Act 2007. The PSI also prioritised reform of the pre‐registration year – the year of training between the undergraduatep rogramme and registration. The National Pharmacy Internship Programme, a globally unique programme, was developed on behalf of the PSI by the School of Pharmacy of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. Successful completion of the programme results in the award of a Masters of Pharmacy (M. Pharm) and entitlement to apply for registration as a pharmacist in Ireland and for subsequent free movement within the EU/EEA under the Professional Qualification Directive (2005 / 36 /EC). The programme is a 12 month, full‐time, blended‐learning programme, attracting 90 European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) credits on completion. The basis for the curriculum is a competency framework that describes the knowledge, skills and attitudes required of a newly registered pharmacist, consistent with international norms. It is envisaged that improvements in the education and training of pharmacists will allow for significante enhancements to be made to the delivery of pharmacy services that capable of being benchmarked against the best internationally...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDiscussions at a {{european}} level aimed at policies {{of economic and}} social cohesion, especially those aimed a smart, sustainable and inclusive growth(Europe 2020 Strategy), provide universities an increasingly important role in achieving the link between the professional training of people and the requirements of the labor market. Given these priorities, the paper shows that efforts should be focused on education accountability, encouraging innovation and improving employment and training policies to meet labor market flexicurity. Also, a greater capacity for research, development and innovation in all sectors of the economy, combined with a good use of resources will improve competitiveness and boost new job creation. In this article is undertaken a comparative analysis of areas where action must be taken and how to be operated, pointing out some differences and performances recorded in the European Union, through the relevant indicators on employment, education and innovation, as part of the system of indicators of life quality.

This framework {{is applied to the}} EU policies for the adult education and training sector {{as well as to the}} proposals presented by UNESCO since the 1970 s with respect to lifelong education and <b>lifelong</b> <b>learning.</b> <b>Lifelong</b> <b>learning</b> and education is a key concept for the development of adult education as an area of practice and theoretical consideration. In recent decades, meanwhile, the idea that education and learning last for the length and breadth of life is central to the guidance of various international organisations and to the public policies of many countries. <b>Lifelong</b> <b>learning</b> is currently widely accepted in terms of its benefits and so the meanings it can contain are rarely questioned. This book proposes three models for analysing public adult education policies, the democratic-emancipatory model, the modernisation and state control model, and the human resources management model. The models guide the critical discussion on the EU policies for the adult education and training sector. This analysis also contains references to national adult education policies. The book further describes the proposals presented by UNESCO since the 1970 s with respect to lifelong education and <b>lifelong</b> <b>learning.</b> The underlying purpose of this approach is to identify and interpret other meanings which the idea may contain today.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines unskilled work-life as {{a condition}} for participating in lifelong learning. The point of departure for this research is the widespread consensus that lifelong learning is necessary in order to ensure both societal and individual welfare and wellbeing. This consensus is rooted in the assumption that a more intensive competitive global economy and advancements in technology as well as new models of organisation have made certain skills obsolete. Accordingly, the labour market develops with a bias toward skills, as demand for an unskilled workforce falls, while demand for skilled and highly educated labour increases. Concurrently, research examining adult education reveals a Matthew Effect, whereby those possessing the highest education are most likely to participate in vocational and educational training. The identification of these challenges formed the impetus for the formulation of a Danish Strategy on Lifelong Learning and Training in 2007. The research question is: How does an unskilled work-life condition the workers’ establishment and reproduction of a learner identity that fulfils the demand to engage in lifelong learning formulated by the national <b>strategy</b> <b>for</b> <b>lifelong</b> <b>learning</b> and training? In order to answer this it is necessary, first, to identify the requirements formulated in the strategy, and the assumptions and premises on which these are based. Next, is it imperative to understand what constitutes the establishment of a learner identity, which enables the fulfilment of the requirements. By taking the perspective of the employee, the dissertation focuses on how specific experiences from an unskilled work-life constitute one’s perception toward participating in various learning activities. It is assumed that the work-life must be perceived as a specific learning space, which give rise to immediate experiences, which determines how the employee perceive participation in different learning activities, and their own possibilities to engage in lifelong learning and training. The dissertations second section focuses on lifelong learning as a political strategy. This section accounts, primarily based on secondary literature, for the tendencies in transnational and Danish policies on lifelong learning and the rationale on which these are based. One possible reason why lifelong learning has become central in welfare politics is then presented. This section concludes with a summary of the premises upon which the National Strategy is formed and the preconditions for its fulfilment. The section reveals that the Strategy on Lifelong learning builds {{on the assumption that the}} use of lifelong learning and education is optimised when driven by demand, and employability is improved by formal education. Additionally the National Strategy requires that the individual take responsibility for future employability by continuously improving skills to meet the demands of the future labour market. The Strategy demands everybody need develop a proactive learner identity. The third section is an introduction to existing research on participation of unskilled labour in lifelong learning. First, five research traditions concerned with recruitment and participation are reviewed. The research interests and concepts of the various traditions are discussed, including implications for understanding engagement in different, but primarily formal learning activities in relation to work-life. Next, research concerning learning opportunities in the workplace are presented, including how companies use formal vocational and educational training with a focus on unskilled labour. This section points to a series of tendencies in current research into participation and recruitment: a widespread optimism for education, a focus on individual motivation and a lack of focus on ambivalence and lack of focus on the specific work. It is argued that research on participation and recruitment should be more attentive toward research concerning learning in work-life in order to understand how unskilled workers perceive engagement in different learning activities. Through a discussion of the different perspectives, of their strengths and weaknesses concerning the field of study, it is ultimately argued that it is necessary to conceptualise the learner identity to encapsulate how the perception of needs and possibilities for engaging different learning activities are embedded in a particular work-life. In section four a theoretical concept of learner identity is developed. First it is assessed how a critical realist perspective, based on Archer’s concepts of concern, inner conversation, modus vivendi and personal and social identity, contributes to an understanding of the relation between work and identity, and how this perspective enables a particular understanding of learner identity. Next, it is assessed how a life-historical-perspective rooted in critical theory, primarily inspired by Salling Olesen, contributes to an understanding of the relation between work and identity, and contributes to an understanding of learner identity. In the section identity - one concept two perspectives it is discussed how the two perspectives contributes to an understanding of the unskilled work-life {{as a condition}} for the establishment of a learner identity. It is argued that it is necessary to employ a perspective that exposes how a learner identity is established and reproduced in a specific process of experience. And experience must be seen as a phenomenon with three modalities, relatively independent but mediated through each other: immediate experiences, life (historical) experiences and cultural knowledge. This implies that learner identity as a dialectic phenomenon is established, maintained and transformed by subjects continuously and actively engaged in specific situations giving rise to immediate experiences and concerns. At the same time the argument is made for the necessity to employ a perspective sensitive to how engagement can contribute to contrasting and conflicting experiences, as well as experiences not possible to articulate. Furthermore the perspective must be sensitive to ambivalence and the possibility of a contradictory identity process. The empirical study conducted in the dissertation examines how the subjects specific experiences from an unskilled work-life constitutes their establishment of a learner identity, including their experiences of possibilities and needs to engage in different learning activities. The empirical study is based on work-life history interviews with workers employed in unskilled jobs in small and medium-sized private factories. As part of the dissertation 24 interviews with employees in six different companies were conducted. Three of these form the basis of the empirical analyses. The methodology is explained and reasoned in the fifth section about the conduction of the empirical research. The sixth part contains the first empirical analysis. Three histories from an unskilled work-life are assessed through narrative analysis of the stories of their entry into the labour market, their work-life history with different jobs and tasks, and how they became suited to perform their jobs and finally how they perceive their future work-life. After every work-life history it is summarised how the specific work-life experiences constitutes their learner identity. The seventh part assesses the establishment of learner identity in an unskilled work-life. First it is examined what specific concerns the unskilled work-life gives rise to. This reveals a number of concerns: a) the natural concerns are the physical strain related to the work, b) the practical concerns is the quality of their work, the quality in their work and the possibilities to employ knowledge and qualifications in the work, and c) the social concerns relate to sustaining employment, retaining wage labour, recognition from superiors, good relations to their colleagues and the balance between work and private life. The analysis shows how involvement in unskilled work gives rise to different and contradictory concerns that need to be taken into account. In part 7. 4 the focus is on how the subjects experience their possibilities to handle their concerns. It reveals how sustaining employment is the ultimate concern, while other concerns are subordinated. At the same time it reveals how they only experience limited control over the factors determining if they can keep their employment, both in their current and possible future jobs. Part 7. 5 assesses how experiences from the unskilled work life and the perception of possibilities to meet these concerns conditions the establishment of a learner identity. The analysis reveals how they experience continuous learning as a necessity, and their learner identity is characterised by an orientation towards the indispensability of knowledge and skills. Further it reveals how the perceived needs and possibilities to improve formal skills related to the current job are restricted by the specific content and organisation of the work. The analysis of the experienced needs and possibility to improve formal skills related to alternative employment shows how these are also restricted due to the changes in the labour market and the organisation of their current work. The changes make the future demand for labour unclear and uncertain. And the current work conditions make it impossible to claim their formal right for education, established by the agreements between labour and management. The analysis reveals how both need for and possibilities to participate in formal education are perceived as other-determined, and the subjects are oriented toward the present because the future is too uncertain to provide orientation. Thus, it is crucial to emphasise that the orientation towards the present is not grounded in reluctance towards change or lack of flexibility. These work-life experiences are the reason why the subjects today have what can be described as a primarily adaptive learner identity. Based on the analysis it is emphasised how the establishment and maintenance of the specific learner identity must be understood as stretched between past, present and future, since it is constituted by the subject’s specific life historical experiences, their immediate experiences and their concerns in their current situation in addition to their imagined future work-life. Section eight concludes on the research question by comparing the assumptions in the national strategy on lifelong learning and the experiences from an unskilled work-life revealed in the empirical analysis. The first assumption was that the use of adult education and training is optimised if more demand driven. The work life story reveals that the correspondence between the societal, individual and workplace-centred short and long term needs for skills should not be taken for granted. The second assumption is that employability is strengthened through formal education. The work life stories show how the employees only experience a limited possibility to employ formal skills in their work and how the content and organisation of the work limits their possibilities to participate in formal education. The strategy demands everyone form a proactive learner identity oriented toward future demands for labour. The work life history reveals how the subjects develop an adaptive learner identity because they perceive their possibilities and need to participate as other-determined, because the future is not perceived as a possible horizon for orientation in their current situation. Thus, the dissertation reveals how the rationale in the Danish educational policy - that everybody should take responsibility for staying employed and maintain one’s employability through formal education towards future demand for labour - conflicts with the work-life experience of unskilled workers. They share the ultimate goal of employment and the perception that everybody has to be flexible and adapt to the need of the workplace. But the situation on the labour market and the uncertainty of the future means that their concern of staying employed becomes counter-productive for developing a proactive learner identity and for their claim to their formal right for education and training. In the end the dissertation reflects how the dialectic concept of learner identity provides certain sensitivity able to comprehend what constitutes unskilled workers’ orientation toward different learning activities. Furthermore how the findings should be taken into account by further research and policy development if we want to understand and increase the participation in lifelong learning for all. This dissertation examines unskilled work-life {{as a condition for}} participating in lifelong learning. The point of departure for this research is the widespread consensus that lifelong learning is necessary in order to ensure both societal and individual welfare and wellbeing. This consensus is rooted in the assumption that a more intensive competitive global economy and advancements in technology as well as new models of organisation have made certain skills obsolete.

Next, it is assessed how a life-historical-perspective rooted in critical theory, primarily inspired by Salling Olesen, contributes to an understanding of the relation between work and identity, and contributes to an understanding of learner identity. In the section identity - one concept two perspectives it is discussed how the two perspectives contributes to an understanding of the unskilled work-life as a condition for the establishment of a learner identity. It is argued that it is necessary to employ a perspective that exposes how a learner identity is established and reproduced in a specific process of experience. And experience must be seen as a phenomenon with three modalities, relatively independent but mediated through each other: immediate experiences, life (historical) experiences and cultural knowledge. This implies that learner identity as a dialectic phenomenon is established, maintained and transformed by subjects continuously and actively engaged in specific situations giving rise to immediate experiences and concerns. At the same time the argument is made for the necessity to employ a perspective sensitive to how engagement can contribute to contrasting and conflicting experiences, as well as experiences not possible to articulate. Furthermore the perspective must be sensitive to ambivalence and the possibility of a contradictory identity process. The empirical study conducted in the dissertation examines how the subjects specific experiences from an unskilled work-life constitutes their establishment of a learner identity, including their experiences of possibilities and needs to engage in different learning activities. The empirical study is based on work-life history interviews with workers employed in unskilled jobs in small and medium-sized private factories. As part of the dissertation 24 interviews with employees in six different companies were conducted. Three of these form the basis of the empirical analyses. The methodology is explained and reasoned in the fifth section about the conduction of the empirical research. The sixth part contains the first empirical analysis. Three histories from an unskilled work-life are assessed through narrative analysis of the stories of their entry into the labour market, their work-life history with different jobs and tasks, and how they became suited to perform their jobs and finally how they perceive their future work-life. After every work-life history it is summarised how the specific work-life experiences constitutes their learner identity. The seventh part assesses the establishment of learner identity in an unskilled work-life. First it is examined what specific concerns the unskilled work-life gives rise to. This reveals a number of concerns: a) the natural concerns are the physical strain related to the work, b) the practical concerns is the quality of their work, the quality in their work and the possibilities to employ knowledge and qualifications in the work, and c) the social concerns relate to sustaining employment, retaining wage labour, recognition from superiors, good relations to their colleagues and the balance between work and private life. The analysis shows how involvement in unskilled work gives rise to different and contradictory concerns that need to be taken into account. In part 7. 4 the focus is on how the subjects experience their possibilities to handle their concerns. It reveals how sustaining employment is the ultimate concern, while other concerns are subordinated. At the same time it reveals how they only experience limited control over the factors determining if they can keep their employment, both in their current and possible future jobs. Part 7. 5 assesses how experiences from the unskilled work life and the perception of possibilities to meet these concerns conditions the establishment of a learner identity. The analysis reveals how they experience continuous learning as a necessity, and their learner identity is characterised by an orientation towards the indispensability of knowledge and skills. Further it reveals how the perceived needs and possibilities to improve formal skills related to the current job are restricted by the specific content and organ...|$|E

Competence is an integrated set of knowledge, skills and dispositions to act, that change and adapt depending on the solution of a specific and contextualized problem, by mobilizing individual internal resources (cognitive, motivational, emotional resources, etc.) and external ones available. Competence is the construct around which {{it is essential to}} rethink the educational processes and consequently, the action of teaching (planning/ evaluation /didactic activities). Among key competences numbers the digital competence: in other words, digital competence involves the confident and critical use of Information Society Technology (IST) and therefore it requires basic skills in Information and Communication Technology (ICT). This article, starts from the premises exposed and aims to perform an analysis of the need to acquire and develop the digital competence. More than, the growing attention to competence advancement implies the requirement to organise a competence curriculum, specifying what are knowledge, skills and learning {{at the base of the}} key competence considered in this work. This descriptive study defines the evaluation rubric as functional tool to evaluate the correspondence between expected behaviors and observable behaviors; moreover, the evaluation rubric is flexible for both the design and the learning outcomes assessment. Aim of the study is to produce a complete and comprehensive description of the components of the evaluation rubric (size, criteria, indicators, anchors, levels) for the digital competence assessment...|$|R

The project focuses on the contribution of the education systems to the process of making <b>lifelong</b> <b>learning</b> a reality and its role as a potential agency of social integration. The survey has revealed that in general, Lithuanian adult learners have a positive attitude towards <b>lifelong</b> <b>learning.</b> A positive attitude towards <b>lifelong</b> <b>learning</b> is held by 63 % of the learners, 37 % - neutral, and 0, 4 % negative.

As with many small businesses, the managers of social enterprises need to be skilled in more than one management function to make their organisations effective. According to EUROPA (www. europa. eu. int), the provision of training to build the skills of social enterprise managers ‘remains fragmented and there are few accepted standards… There is therefore a need for better-targeted and widely available training in social enterprise management’. This project began with the title ‘Benchmarking in Social Enterprises’. As empirical evidence on which to develop benchmarking in the area of Social Enterprise was lacking the project began with research to identify business and management issues. This {{led to the development of}} an analysis tool that would offer managers action steps to develop their enterprises. This tool became known as ‘Balance’. The main purpose of the project was to undertake skills analyses of SMEs in the Social Enterprise sector. These aims were to identify higher level management and organisational development/skill needs in order to support <b>strategies</b> <b>for</b> <b>lifelong</b> <b>learning</b> that take into consideration the nuances of Social Enterprises. The project focuses particularly on understanding learning that occurs through experiential routes and via networks that is grounded in the day-to-day activities of the enterprise. As it is known that small business owners prefer to learn as informally as possible, this was believed to be the most appropriate vehicle for delivering skills development within Social Enterprises. ‘There is a wealth of relatively easily accessible data for scholars conducting research into traditional business and management issues. Additionally, there are a significant number of well-respected journals for each discipline, most of which have not historically published much related to the social sector. Good social sector data is more difficult to find, and the outlets for publishing are limited’. www. fuqua. duke. edu/centers/case/faculty/research. html Center for the Advancement of Social Entrepreneurship. This report provides a context to the project by summarising the small amount of literature that relates to Social Enterprises in their many forms (Part 1). This includes a discussion of what can be defined as a ‘Social Enterprise’. Background research was undertaken to ensure that the project was based on a clear understanding and analysis of the needs of Social Enterprises and that its methodology (Part 2) and content reflected those needs. The project began with gathering empirical evidence, fifteen qualitative interviews with key Social Enterprise support agencies and Social Enterprises within Greater Manchester. The resulting data were integrated into a ‘loose’ 65 framework, based on Kaplan & Norton’s balanced scorecard (BSC) using qualitative causal mapping software (Decision Explorer & NVivo). An indepth analysis of the findings (Part 3), from the interviews was conducted which identified key issues (concepts). The findings formed the basis for the development of ‘Balance’ – a Social Enterprise business performance analysis tool (Part 4). The ‘Balance’ tool was then piloted with 30 social enterprises, the findings are discussed in Part 5. The principle outcome is to highlight to Social Enterprises the opportunities for learning through their day-to-day activities. The outcomes, since they are directly related to the context within which the organisations work, will be directly appropriate to and of benefit to the target group. Our findings from the ‘Balance’ business performance analysis tool reveal social enterprises have similar organisational issues to that of other small businesses. However, social enterprises we found, were more advanced and strategic. As expected, participative cultures existed and enterprises were strongly mission focused. Many social enterprises however, were slow to develop marketing strategies, evidence suggests needs based focus, as opposed to developing brand and differentiation strategies. Social enterprises were reactive to stakeholder needs, rather than proactively marketing their social values or demonstrating their organisational effectiveness through quality marks, such as PQASSO. In conclusion, the balance concept was well recieved and evidenced through the findings where all 30 pilot organisations demonstrated clear balance across the issues of multi-bottom line, stakeholder perspective, learning and growth, internal activities and visioning. ...|$|R
