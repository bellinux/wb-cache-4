25|$|For long-distance travel, {{reservation}} of a berth can be {{done for}} comfortable travel up to 120 days before the date of intended travel. Details such as the name, age and concession (if eligible) are required and are recorded on the ticket.

25|$|For <b>super-fast</b> trains, {{the second}} digit is always 2 (the first remains 1 or 2), the third digit is the zone, the fourth is the {{division}} {{and only the}} last digit is the serial number within the division. Trains travelling in opposite directions along the same route are usually labelled with consecutive numbers. However, there is considerable variation in train numbers and some zones, such as Central Railway, has a less systematic method for numbering trains. Most express trains also have a unique name that is usually exotic and taken from landmarks, famous people, rivers and so on.|$|E
500|$|Polygons Arthur Gies remarked {{positively}} {{upon the}} exploration for collectables and secrets, and their {{relevance to the}} new upgrade feature, but he was critical of instances where the game would lock away sections of a level without warning. Zack Furniss of Destructoid was originally skeptical regarding the [...] "glory kills" [...] feature, as were other critics, fearing that they might distract from the fast-paced gameplay. He ultimately considered them to fit well {{in the flow of}} gameplay that keeps players in the middle of combat without a slowed pace. Giant Bombs Brad Shoemaker felt that the glory kills' generating small amounts of health and armor [...] "makes them {{an essential part of the}} give-and-take of Dooms <b>super-fast</b> combat; do you dart into the fray for a glory kill to get a little health back, and risk getting mobbed by all the other enemies around?" [...] Conversely, Kyle Orland of Ars Technica felt that the glory kills' briefly taking control away from the player can easily disorient players or misposition them, finding them hard to ignore for players that choose not to use them.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Hidden Place" [...] was {{directed}} by Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin and co-directed by M/M (Paris). It was shot in London over four days in February 2001. It was originally planned for a song from Selmasongs, but Björk felt the project was more appropriate for Vespertine. The video consists of close-up shots panning around Björk's face, as fluids flow {{in and out of}} her facial orifices. M/M (Paris) explained the concept behind the video:We always wanted to get as close to her as we could, as we all felt she had never been portrayed as the [...] "real" [...] and beautiful woman she is. This is somehow taboo, to observe a pop star with no makeup from a distance of half an inch. Then the idea of the liquid works as a visualization of all possible emotions pulsating and circulating in her very busy brain. The loop idea was a main point for us as well, trying to extend the usual time frame of pop video <b>super-fast</b> editing, to make it hypnotising, mesmerising and irritating, like an eternally burning fireplace.|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast, [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] finished thirteenth {{place in the}} ratings for the week of May 23–29, 1990, with a Nielsen rating of 16.4. It was the highest rated show on the Fox network that week. The episode received generally positive reviews from critics. Series creator Matt Groening listed it as his ninth favorite episode of The Simpsons and added [...] "I have a peculiar love of TV clownery". Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, praised the episode: [...] "The invention of the Simpsons' arch enemy as a lugubrious yet psychotic Englishman in dreadlocks succeeds wonderfully in this <b>super-fast,</b> super-funny episode that works by constantly reversing the audience's expectations." [...] In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 3/5. Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that [...] "throughout the episode we found great material; it really seemed clear that the show was starting to turn into the piece we now know and love. It’s hard for me to relate any deficiencies" [...] and added that [...] "almost every Bob episode offers a lot of fun, and this episode started that trend in fine style." ...|$|E
2500|$|The American Veterinary Medical Association accepts {{maceration}} {{subject to}} certain conditions, but recommends alternative methods of culling as more humane. Egg-laying hens are {{then transferred to}} [...] "battery cages" [...] where they are kept in high densities. Matheny and Leahy attribute osteoporosis in hens to this caging method. Broiler chickens suffer similar situations, {{in which they are}} fed steroids to grow at a <b>super-fast</b> speed, so fast that their bones, heart and lungs often cannot keep up. Broiler chickens under six weeks old suffer painful crippling due to fast growth rates, whilst one in a hundred of these very young birds dies of heart failure.|$|E

Many of the skippers competing in the Sydney-Hobart race in the 21st century have expressed a desire to be the first to record a time under the once thought of as impossible mark of 40 hrs. [...] In 2016, the race record was set by Perpetual Loyal to one day, 13 hours, 31 minutes and 20 seconds.|$|E
2500|$|All the inter-city rail {{services}} which {{operate at}} the station are operated by the Indian Railways.

2500|$|Ringer was not {{selected}} in the first 4 rounds of the draft, where he was projected to go by some. Instead, Ringer was selected by the Tennessee Titans in the 5th round of the 2009 NFL Draft, 173rd overall, the 11th RB taken overall. At the time of being drafted, {{he was one of}} eight Running Backs on the Titans roster. Terry McCormick of the Nashville City Paper, when grading the Titans draft, gave the Ringer pick an [...] "A". Ringer said on his Twitter page about being drafted “Titans! I can’t tell you how excited I am!”. He was the first (and only) MSU player drafted this year. Ringer said of his future pro career, [...] "I definitely have something to prove with me showing that I am just as good, if not better, than a lot of the running backs that went above me. I don't want {{to be one of those}} running backs who is titled as, He was a good running back in college and went to the NFL and became a bust. I want to make sure I continue to be called a great running back also in the NFL." [...] He mentioned of where he would fit in, [...] "I would say I fit in pretty well. I know Chris Johnson is kind of like the <b>super-fast</b> one, and LenDale White is like the really big one. I would kind of be in the middle." [...] Ringer is expected to [...] play special teams and operate as a third-down back. Ringer said of the running back situation in Tennessee, [...] "I feel very confident in my abilities. I feel like I'm definitely going to learn a lot from the vets. I'm very happy to be in a room with LenDale White and Chris Johnson. I'm going to make sure to play my role and push them in practice. I'm also going to make sure I ... continue to do what I can do to help Tennessee." [...] Because 23 was taken by Donnie Nickey, Ringer was assigned #3, a number normally prohibited for use by running backs. He kept the number until early August, when he switched to number 21.|$|E
