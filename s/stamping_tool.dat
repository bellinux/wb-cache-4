40|$|Press {{hardening}} {{is widely}} utilized to form ultra-high-strength steels {{characterized by a}} high strength-to-weight ratio for automotive components. Press hardening processes include heating boron–manganese steels to austenite phase, forming the steels at a high temperature, and cooling the formed blanks until the martensite phase is reached. However, press hardening processes lead to severe contact conditions between the blank and the tools including contact pressure, relative sliding, and high temperatures, which result in tool wear and increased maintenance cost. The contact conditions {{that occur in the}} <b>stamping</b> <b>tool</b> are difficult to study on site. Additionally, simplified tests, such as pin on disc and ball on disc, are insufficient to reproduce press hardening conditions in laboratory environments. The aim of this study includes developing a tribological test with press hardening conditions in which tool steel pins continuously slide on fresh and hot boron–manganese steel strips. The test programme mimics press hardening conditions with respect to sliding distance, sliding velocity, contact pressure, and surface temperature that were studied based on finite element (FE) simulations of a press hardening experiment. Furthermore, a FE simulation of the tribological test is established and it provides contact temperature in the pin tip with a high accuracy. A tribological test is used to study friction and mass loss with variational pressures and velocities that represented typically variational contact conditions in the press hardening.

40|$|Implementation {{of press}} {{hardened}} parts in automobile {{responses to the}} requirement of reduced carbon dioxide emission because the press hardened part has very high ratio of strength to weight. Furthermore, ultra high-strength steels (press hardened parts) increases the vehicle safety. The press hardening processes are prevalently applied in global automotive industries. However, the press hardening processes corresponding to heating, forming, and cooling processes result in harsh contact conditions such as cyclic pressures, high temperatures and complex reactions between coatings and tool steels. Consequently, these harsh contact conditions increase the tool maintenance due to abrasive wear and adhesive wear. In order to study tribological behaviours in the press hardening, two kinds of the tribological experiments have been developed and used. Firstly, a reciprocating test, also called SRV test, is performed at elevated temperatures to study the wear mechanisms under press hardening conditions. However, {{the discrepancy between the}} press hardening and SRV test is obvious. To overcome the disadvantage, a sliding tribometer, also called tribolgoical test, is used as the second tribological test. A unidirectional sliding process is running under the corresponding pressures, temperatures, velocities and sliding distances. These test parameters are based on press hardening simulations. According to the present study, the abrasive wear is the predominant wear mechanism in the uncoated interface of the press hardening processes. When Al-Si coated workpieces are applied in the press hardening, severe adhesive wear, also called galling, substantially occurs in the <b>stamping</b> <b>tool.</b> The modelling of the abrasive and adhesive wear is derived from the Archard wear model in which the specific coefficients for the wear are calibrated by the tribological tests.

Stamping refers to the forming of sheet metal parts through material flow and strain induced by mechanical loading.

It is hypothesized that knowledge of the contact pressure distribution across the interface between the tool and workpiece will provide insight into stamping process and improve the observability and controllability of this manufacturing process by accessing the previously untapped potential of spatio-temporal domain information for describing the primary interaction. ^ This research presents an online sensing method that measures the in-process contact pressure distribution at the tool-workpiece interface through an array of dynamic force sensors embedded in the <b>stamping</b> <b>tool.</b> This provides a spatio-temporal record of the tool-workpiece interaction during the sheet metal deformation process which is valuable for die design optimization and tool wear monitoring. More importantly the proposed sensing method will enable process designers to better control the stamping process by providing feedback on the tool-workpiece interaction. ^ There are several fundamental scientific and engineering issues that have been addressed in this work for realizing a robust measurement technique. These issues are classified as follows. ^ Scientific Issues: Optimal sensor location selection through geometric and model based techniques, numeric reconstruction of spatially sparse measurements, formulation of data fusion techniques for model augmented pressure reconstruction, modeling of piezo-electric transducers under generalized electro-mechanical loading, and construction of stamping pressure and draw-in maps for the representation of stamping process dynamics. ^ Engineering Issues: Characterization of tooling integrated sensors and contact interactions through experiments and empirical models, large scale experimental evaluation of tooling integrated sensing technology, design and characterization of a self energized wireless sensor. ^ It is envisioned that the technology and methods presented in this work will add to the fundamental understanding of the stamping process dynamics and advance the state-of-art in sensing and data analysis for intelligent manufacturing. ...|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{requirements}} of higher strength components and lower carbon dioxide emission, press hardening becomes prevalent in the automotive industry. Heating a boron alloyed steel blank to obtain the austensite phase at high temperature and quenching it to martensitic phase enhances the strength of the products and still allows complex shapes. However, the <b>stamping</b> <b>tool</b> has to endure severe temperature changes, impacts of the counterpart and sliding processes. The wear including material transfer, surface scuffing and complicated reactions between coatings and superficial oxide layers not only shortens the service-life of tools but also decreases the productivity {{and the quality of the}} manufacturing process. Furthermore, the harsh contact conditions between the stamping tools and the work-piece, regarded as the reason for the wear, are difficult to measure in situ. The fundamental study on the tool wear in the press hardening receives insufficient attention. The present work aims at establishing an understanding of tribological characteristics in press hardening and at developing a predictive wear model by establishing a relationship between the contact conditions and the wear process. Based on these results, the extension of the service life of stamping tools through adjustment of process parameters can be possible. Sliding wear, as the dominant wear phenomenon taking place during press hardening processes, causes formation of wear particles and transfer of material fragments to the tool surface. Since the wear process is dependent on the contact conditions, finite element (FE) simulations based on thermo-mechanical calculations are used to investigate the contact conditions in a given press hardening process. Based on the results from the FE [...] simulations, reciprocating tests and tribolgical tests are conducted respectively under press hardening conditions to evaluate the wear coefficients of the Archard's wear model. A modified wear model is implemented in the FE [...] simulations to predict wear depths on the stamping tools. It is noted that most wear concentrates on the tool radius and that it correlates with the sliding distance. The correlation between the experimental set-ups and the wear predictions are analysed. An industrial experimental set-up for validation of the wear model predictions has been developed. The future work on this study is outlined.

Replacing the <b>stamping</b> <b>tool</b> material from steel to lightweight aluminium with protective coatings offers significant gains such as reduction in power costs and increasing operational efficiency during manufacturing of sheet automobile parts. In this study, the WC-CoCr and Cr 3 C 2 -NiCr coatings were sprayed with High Velocity Air-Fuel (HVAF) process and Al 2 O 3 coating was deposited using Atmosphere Plasma Spraying (APS) process. The coatings were evaluated and compared {{based on the results of}} roughness tests, hardness tests, adhesion tests, quantitative imaging analysis and microstructure analysis. The experimental results revealed that the roughness value varied in a lower range which implies of a high density of the coatings. It was found that coatings have an extremely high hardness value as tested by the Vickers hardness test. The WC-Co coating was found to be the hardest (1215. 2 HV). The adhesion test was implemented according to the ASTM C 633 - 79 standard. The result showed that WC-Co and Cr 3 C 2 -NiCr coatings without a bond coat had high tensile strength, higher than the respective glue strength (63. 54 MPa, 75. 89 MPa). Whereas, the Al 2 O 3 coating has a much lower tensile strength (15. 2 MPa, 25. 68 MPa, with and without bond) than others and using a bond coat layer does not contribute to an increase in adhesion strength of the cermet coatings. The coating thickness was evaluated using Light Optical Microscopy (LOM) and microstructure analysis was carried out using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). From the microstructure analysis, it was observed that all the coatings have a dense microstructure, very low porosity and low oxide inclusions in top coat. The WC and Cr 3 C 2 grains retain a large volume fraction of finely dispersed in matrix. The alumina coating was found to have low levels of un-melted or the re-solidified particles in the coating.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to develop the {{fundamentals}} of materials modelling to enable effective process control of hot stamping for forming UHSS panels with graded properties for optimised functional performance. A selective heating and press hardening strategy is adopted to grade the microstructural distribution of a press hardened component through differential heat treatment of the blank prior to forming. Comprehensive material models, to enable prediction of austenite formation and deformation behaviours of boron steel under hot forming conditions, as well as the dynamic response of a press hardened part with tailored properties in collision situations, have been developed based on experimental investigations and mechanism studies. The research work is concerned with four aspects: feasibility of the selective heating and press hardening strategy, austenite formation in boron steel during selective heating, thermo-mechanical properties of boron steel under hot stamping, and mechanical properties of boron steel with various microstructures at room temperature. Feasibility studies for the selective heating and press hardening strategy were carried out through a designed experimental programme. A lab-scale demonstrator part was designed and relevant manufacturing and property-assessment processes were defined. A heating technique and selective-heating rigs were designed to enable certain microstructural distributions in blanks to be obtained. A hot <b>stamping</b> <b>tool</b> set was designed for forming and quenching the parts. Test pieces were formed under various heating conditions to obtain demonstrator parts having variously graded microstructures. Microstructural distributions in the as-formed parts were determined through hardness testing and microstructural observation. Ultimately, the structural performance of the parts was evaluated through bending tests. Heat treatment tests were performed to study the formation of austenite in boron steel during selective heating. Characterisation of the effects of heating rate and temperature on transformation behavior was conducted based on the test results. A unified austenite formation model, capable of predicting full or partial austenite formation under both isothermal and non-isothermal conditions, was developed, and determined from the heat treatment test results. Hot tensile tests were performed to study the thermo-mechanical properties of the austenite and initial phase (ferrite and pearlite) of boron steel. The viscoplastic deformation behaviours of the both phase states were analysed in terms of strain rate and temperature dependence based on the test results. A viscoplastic-damage constitutive model, capable of describing the thermo-mechanical response of boron steel in a state corresponding to hot stamping after selective heating, was proposed. Values of constants in the model for both the austenite and initial phase were calibrated from the hot tensile test results. Dynamic and quasi-static tensile testes combined with hardness testing and microstructural observation were carried out to study the mechanical properties of press hardened boron steel with various microstructures at room temperature. Based on the results, the strain rate sensitivity of the martensite and initial phase of boron steel was characterised; the relationships between mechanical properties (true ultimate tensile strength, 0. 2...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{optimize}} {{the layout of the}} conformal cooling channels in hot <b>stamping</b> <b>tools,</b> a response surface methodology and multi-objective optimization technique are proposed. By means of an Optimal Latin Hypercube experimental design method, a design matrix with 17 factors and 50 levels is generated. Three kinds of design variables, the radius Rad of the cooling channel, the distance H from the channel center to tool work surface and the ratio rat of each channel center, are optimized to determine the layout of cooling channels. The average temperature and temperature deviation of work surface are used to evaluate the cooling performance of hot <b>stamping</b> <b>tools.</b> On the basis of the experimental design results, quadratic response surface models are established to describe the relationship between the design variables and the evaluation objectives. The error analysis is performed to ensure the accuracy of response surface models. Then the layout of the conformal cooling channels is optimized in accordance with a multi-objective optimization method to find the Pareto optimal frontier which consists of some optimal combinations of design variables that can lead to an acceptable cooling performance...|$|R
