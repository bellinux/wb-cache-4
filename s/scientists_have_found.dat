5|$|The Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers {{are two of}} Antarctica's five largest ice streams. <b>Scientists</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> {{that the}} flow of these ice streams has {{accelerated}} in recent years, and suggested {{that if they were}} to melt, global sea levels would rise by , destabilising the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet and perhaps sections of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.|$|E
5|$|There {{are reasons}} that seamounts are biologically important. They rise {{high in the}} water column, {{creating}} complex current patterns that support life on, around, and above the seamount. The surface of the seamount also provides a substrate upon which organisms can attach themselves and grow. This in turn supports the species that feed on them, in turn supporting the whole ecological food web. <b>Scientists</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> that seamounts often provide a habitat for endemic species that are not found anywhere else.|$|E
5|$|Using {{data from}} Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, <b>scientists</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> {{widespread}} deposits of chloride minerals. Evidence {{suggests that the}} deposits were formed from the evaporation of mineral enriched waters. The research suggests that lakes may have been scattered over {{large areas of the}} Martian surface. Usually chlorides are the last minerals to come out of solution. Carbonates, sulfates, and silica should precipitate out ahead of them. Sulfates and silica have been found by the Mars Rovers on the surface. Places with chloride minerals may have once held various life forms. Furthermore, such areas could preserve traces of ancient life.|$|E

50|$|Using {{data from}} mtDNA analysis, <b>scientist</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> that {{evolution}} of hammerhead sharks has probably begun with a taxon {{that had a}} highly pronounced cephalofoil (most likely that similar to the winghead shark, Eusphyra blochii), and has later been modified through selective pressures. Thus, judging by their smaller cephalofoils, bonnethead sharks are the more recent developments of a 25-million-year evolutionary process.|$|R

50|$|A 2006 {{study by}} Canadian <b>scientists</b> <b>has</b> <b>found</b> five species of deep-sea fish - blue hake, spiny eel - {{to be on}} the verge of {{extinction}} due to the shift of commercial fishing from continental shelves to the slopes of the continental shelves, down to depths of 1600 meters. The slow reproduction of these fish - they reach sexual maturity at about the same age as human beings - is one of the main reasons that they cannot recover from the excessive fishing.|$|R

50|$|The Dulong-Petit law, a {{thermodynamic}} rule {{proposed in}} 1819 by French physicists Pierre Louis Dulong and Alexis Thérèse Petit, states the classical expression for the molar {{specific heat capacity}} of certain chemical elements. Experimentally the two <b>scientists</b> <b>had</b> <b>found</b> that the heat capacity per weight (the mass-specific heat capacity) {{for a number of}} elements was close to a constant value, after it had been multiplied by a number representing the presumed relative atomic weight of the element. These atomic weights had shortly before been suggested by Dalton.|$|R

25|$|<b>Scientists</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> {{worldwide}} {{evidence of}} a swift decrease of about 1% in the 13C/12C isotope ratio in carbonate rocks from the end-Permian. This is the first, largest, and most rapid {{of a series of}} negative and positive excursions (decreases and increases in 13C/12C ratio) that continues until the isotope ratio abruptly stabilised in the middle Triassic, followed soon afterwards by the recovery of calcifying life forms (organisms that use calcium carbonate to build hard parts such as shells).|$|E
25|$|As {{the global}} {{temperature}} of the Earth warms each year, many butterfly species are forced to shift northward {{in order to keep}} living in their preferred climates. <b>Scientists</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> that migratory species, such as monarch butterflies, are better able to adapt to the rising temperatures than sedentary species, such as Glanville fritillaries. Glanville fritillaries will migrate around the Åland Islands to different habitat patches, but they will not embark on great transcontinental seasonal migrations like other butterflies do. Because of this they are very susceptible to climate change, which is something to keep in mind when considering plans to aid in the conservation of this species.|$|E
25|$|Variations {{within the}} Genome are being studied to {{determine}} susceptibility to chronic diseases {{as well as}} infectious diseases. According to Aileen Kenneson and Coleen Boyle, about one sixth of the U.S. population has some degree of hearing loss. Recent research has linked variants in the Gap Junction Beta 2 (GJB2) gene to nonsyndromic prelingual sensorineural hearing loss. GJB2 is a gene encoding for connexin a protein found in the cochlea. So far, <b>scientists</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> over 90 variants in this gene and sequence variations may account for up to 50% of nonsyndromic hearing loss. Variants in GJB2 are being looked at to determine age of onset as well as severity of hearing loss.|$|E
50|$|Many {{aspects of}} MERS {{are still being}} researched. <b>Scientist</b> <b>have</b> {{recently}} <b>found</b> that the cellular receptor for MERS-CoV is CD24, found in smooth muscle cells, pneumocytes, and bronchiolar epithelial cells. There is a sensitive and specific RT-qPCR assay available for detection of MERS-CoV.|$|R

500|$|Despite {{the large}} amount of {{information}} available, many important aspects of perception remain mysterious. A great deal is known about low-level signal processing in sensory systems, but the ways by which sensory systems interact with each other, with [...] "executive" [...] systems in the frontal cortex, and with the language system are very incompletely understood. At a deeper level, there are still basic conceptual issues that remain unresolved. [...] Many <b>scientists</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> it difficult to reconcile the fact that information is distributed across multiple brain areas with the apparent unity of consciousness: this is one aspect of the so-called binding problem. There are also some scientists who have expressed grave reservations about the idea that the brain forms representations of the outside world at all: influential members of this group include psychologist J. J. Gibson and roboticist Rodney Brooks, who both argued in favor of [...] "intelligence without representation".|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the past}} three decades, social <b>scientists</b> <b>have</b> <b>found</b> that {{minority}} individuals suffer from {{mental and physical health}} disparities compared to their peers in majority groups. [...] This research has focused primarily on racial and sexual minorities. [...] For example, African Americans have been found to suffer elevated rates of hypertension compared to Whites. Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals face higher rates of suicide, substance abuse, and cancer relative to heterosexuals. These health disparities impact day-to-day well-being as well as overall life expectancy, leading social scientists to ask: How can we reduce minority health disparities? [...] In order to answer this question, it was first important to explore the underlying causes of the disparities.|$|E
2500|$|... (2007) Respirators' {{protection}} {{factor was}} measured under {{the conditions of}} exposure of workers with xylene and ethylbenzene vapors. Also, the team members conducted biomonitoring of exposure.

The authors recommended the use of more hygienic methods of painting, since the use of skin protection continuously in hot tropical conditions difficult to achieve.|$|E
2500|$|Simulation work {{published}} in 2005 by Robin Canup suggested that Charon {{could have been}} formed by a collision around 4.5 billion years ago, much like Earth and the Moon. In this model, a large Kuiper belt object struck Pluto at high velocity, destroying itself and blasting off much of Pluto's outer mantle, and Charon coalesced from the debris. However, such an impact should result in an icier Charon and rockier Pluto than <b>scientists</b> <b>have</b> <b>found.</b> It is now thought that Pluto and Charon might have been two bodies that collided before going into orbit about each other. The collision would have been violent enough to boil off volatile ices like methane (...) but not violent enough to have destroyed either body. The very similar density of Pluto and Charon implies that the parent bodies were not fully differentiated when the impact occurred.|$|E
