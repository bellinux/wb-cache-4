50|$|This plant {{competes with}} and {{inhibits}} tree seedlings {{such as those}} of <b>southern</b> <b>white</b> <b>cedar.</b> In sunny sites it grows better and can form dense thickets. When burned or damaged it resprouts vigorously from its large rhizome. This rapidly climbing vine is a silvicultural pest.|$|E
50|$|In Alabama, vast {{forests of}} pine {{constitute}} the largest {{proportion of the}} state's forest growth. There is also an abundance of cypress, hickory, oak, populus, and eastern redcedar trees. In other areas, hemlock growths {{in the north and}} <b>southern</b> <b>white</b> <b>cedar</b> in the southwest. Other native trees include ash, hackberry, and holly. In the Gulf region of the state grow various species of palmetto and palm. In Alabama there are more than 150 shrubs, including mountain laurel and rhododendron. Among cultivated plants are wisteria and camellia.|$|E
50|$|This shrub {{grows in}} coastal plain habitat among pines such as loblolly, slash, and shortleaf pines, and oak species. It occurs in several habitat types {{including}} savanna, forest, bog, and pocosin. The climate is mild {{in the winter}} and hot and humid in the summer. It is not tolerant of shade and is usually found in full sunlight. It can be found growing with swamp blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica var. biflora), loblolly bay (Gordonia lasianthus), sweetbay (Persea borbonia), red maple (Acer rubrum), titi (Cyrilla racemiflora), <b>southern</b> <b>white</b> <b>cedar</b> (Chamaecyparis thyoides), hurrahbush (Lyonia lucida), sweet pepperbush (Clethra alnifolia), southern bayberry (Myrica cerifera), and laurelleaf greenbrier (Smilax laurifolia).|$|E

Atlantic <b>white</b> <b>cedar</b> swamps are a globally rare type of natural community. Of the 500000 acre of wetlands in New Hampshire, only about 550 acre are Atlantic <b>white</b> <b>cedar</b> swamps.|$|R
5000|$|The name Keithia thujina {{was used}} by Elias Judah Durand in 1908 for the first record of the disease in the United States on eastern <b>white</b> <b>cedar.</b> Durand in 1913, further {{described}} and illustrated Keithia thujina that was collected from mature trees of eastern <b>white</b> <b>cedar</b> in Wisconsin. [...] Durand felt that the disease only affected the host when environmental conditions favoured epidemics. G. C. Carew noted cedar leaf blight on eastern <b>white</b> <b>cedar</b> in Newfoundland.|$|R
5000|$|This plant {{grows in}} bogs, swamps, and marshy areas. It is a {{dominant}} plant in pocosins. The soils are wet to saturated and the sites are often flooded. It {{is common in}} the Everglades and it is [...] "characteristic" [...] of the Okefenokee Swamp understory flora. It grows beneath cypress, swamp blackgum (N. sylvatica), white bay (Magnolia virginiana), loblolly bay (Gordonia lasianthus), sweet bay (Persea borbonia), red maple (Acer rubrum), cassena (Ilex cassine), titi (Cyrilla racemiflora), and <b>southern</b> <b>white</b> <b>cedar</b> (Chamaecyparis thyoides). In the understory it is associated with hurrahbush (Lyonia lucida), leucothoe (Leucothoe racemosa), sweetspire (Itea virginica), poor-man's soap (Clethra alnifolia), coral greenbrier (S. walteri), and honeycup (Zenobia pulverulenta).|$|E
50|$|Chamaecyparis thyoides (Atlantic white cedar, Atlantic white cypress, <b>{{southern}}</b> <b>white</b> <b>cedar,</b> whitecedar, or false-cypress), {{a species}} of Cupressaceae, is native to the Atlantic coast of North America and is found from southern Maine to Georgia and along the Gulf of Mexico coast from Florida to Mississippi. It {{is one of two}} species of Chamaecyparis found in North America. C. thyoides resides on the East Coast and C. lawsoniana {{can be found on the}} West Coast. There are two geographically isolated subspecies, treated by some botanists as distinct species, by others at just varietal rank: Chamaecyparis thyoides thyoides and Chamaecyparis thyoides henryae (H.L.Li) E.Murray (syn. Chamaecyparis thyoides subsp. henryae (H.L.Li) Little; Chamaecyparis henryae H.L.Li) The species grows in forested wetlands where they tend to dominate the canopy. The trees are associated with a wide variety of other wetland species because of their wide north-south range. The remaining populations are now found mostly in remote locations that would be difficult to harvest, so its popularity as a source of lumber has decreased.|$|E
50|$|In India, it is {{also known}} by many other names such as, Indian <b>white</b> <b>cedar,</b> Bili devdari, Bombay <b>white</b> <b>cedar,</b> Velley agil, Porapa, Vella agil and Devagarige and in the {{evergreen}} forest regions of Western Ghats, North Kanara, Coorg, Anamalais, and Travancore regions.|$|R

50|$|Swamp forests {{dominated}} by Atlantic <b>white</b> <b>cedar</b> (Chamaecyparis thyoides) occur along the waterways {{of the pine}} barrens. The <b>white</b> <b>cedars</b> often grow from pools of standing water and, {{in contrast to the}} surrounding pine forests, considerably darken the understory. Amid the <b>white</b> <b>cedars</b> are red maple (Acer rubrum), sour gum (Nyssa sylvatica), pitch pine, and sweet bay magnolia (Magnolia virginiana). In openings and edges grow highbush blueberry, dangleberry, swamp azalea (Rhododendron viscosum), fetterbush (Eubotrys racemosa), and leatherleaf (Chamaedaphne calyculata). Sweet pepperbush (Clethra alnifolia), inkberry (Ilex glabra), and winterberry (Ilex verticillata) are also present.|$|R

The purpose of the proposed action is to regenerate Atlantic <b>white</b> <b>cedar</b> stands in degraded condition to ensure the stands are not replaced with hardwood stands. This project is needed because the results of forest inventories have indicated competition-induced mortality and declining conditions of the Atlantic <b>white</b> <b>cedar</b> stands on the Dare County Range. Atlantic <b>white</b> <b>cedar</b> {{is considered to be}} imperiled by NatureServe and the North Carolina Natural Heritage Program. The Environmental Assessment (EA), incorporated by reference into this finding, analyzes the potential environmental consequences of activities associated with the regeneration of 83 acres of Atlantic <b>white</b> <b>cedar,</b> and provides environmental protection measures to avoid or reduce adverse environmental impacts. The EA considers all potential impacts of Alternative A (Proposed Action) and the No-Action Alternative. The EA also considers cumulative environmental impacts with other projects at the Dare County Range.

50|$|Cattus Island Park also {{contains}} freshwater wetlands. These wetlands {{are dominated by}} hardwood trees such as Red Maple or Swamp Maple, Sour Gum or Tupelo and {{a wide variety of}} others. There are a few small stands of living Atlantic <b>White</b> <b>Cedar</b> located in some of the wetland areas. However, in this area, large stands of dead Atlantic <b>white</b> <b>cedar</b> also exist. They have been standing dead since the 1930s. Prior to the 1930s, {{the northern part of the}} Barnegat Bay, where Cattus Island is located, was mainly fresh water. After the Point Pleasant Canal was constructed and the Manasquan inlet improved, saltwater from the ocean infiltrated into the Northern portion of the bay. As a result, the Atlantic <b>white</b> <b>cedar,</b> which is an obligate freshwater species, was killed.|$|R
