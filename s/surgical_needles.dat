The distances between the modified TVT-O surgically inserted needle and obturator nerve branches were measured in fresh cadaver. The introduced <b>surgical</b> <b>needle</b> caused no trauma to any of the adjacent cadaveric organs, and the distances between the <b>surgical</b> <b>needle</b> and the obturator nerve branches was 4  cm. The modified TVT-O needle route is shown to be safe and remote from the obturator nerve branches, thus conduction of a clinical study for evaluation of related pain reduction is recommended.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{the performance of}} a needle insertion teleoperated system with haptic feedback. Through a haptic device, the surgeon tele-operates the <b>surgical</b> <b>needle,</b> fixed on the remote robot that may evolve in free space or in contact. In free space, the surgeon feels the motion of the robot. During the needle insertion, the puncture of the tissue involves an abrupt and large change in the magnitude of the applied force. To perform and improve the tele-operated task, an on-line transparency improvement is achieved using the environment stiffness estimation. The transparency is improved based on the stability of the haptic feedback teleoperation scheme in which we distinguish between the voluntary and involuntary operator position. The quality of telepresence allows the surgeon to perform and exactly characterize the needle insertion phases without using additional transition detection techniques. To assess the proposed teleoperation scheme, a <b>surgical</b> <b>needle</b> rigidly attached to the robot and ex-vivo tissues are used...|$|R

50|$|During the {{two decades}} {{bridging}} the formation of The Torrington Company of Connecticut in 1917 and its dissolution in 1936 when The Torrington Company of Maine absorbed its assets, the diversified manufacturing concern grew in stature, recording notable successes and a share of failures during an era pocked by global conflict. World War I brought Torrington into a new business line when the government requested that the well-known needle manufacturing concern begin producing <b>surgical</b> <b>needles,</b> a complex product to manufacture that Torrington had little interest and no experience in making. Before the war, Europe, particularly England, had been the primary source for <b>surgical</b> <b>needles</b> for the United States, but when World War II broke out, the supply of <b>surgical</b> <b>needles</b> into the United States slowed to a trickle. Torrington compensated for the precipitous drop in surgical needle imports, but only at the government's request. Spark plugs and marine engines, shipped to Torrington's subsidiary in England, {{and the production of}} 75 millimeter shells were also included in the company's war-time contributions, but unlike many other manufacturing concerns, Torrington was able to conduct business on a fairly normal level throughout the war, emerging from the war years as strong, if not stronger, than it had entered them.|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: The loss of an {{instrument}} during a surgical procedure is a potentially dangerous medical event. Retained <b>surgical</b> <b>needles</b> {{are reported to}} cause chronic pain, chronic irritation, and organ injury. <b>Surgical</b> <b>needles</b> lost during minimally invasive surgery are particularly difficult to retrieve because of their dimin-utive size and the camera’s limited visual field, often prompting protracted recovery attempts that can add to surgical costs. Few detailed recommendations exist for the recovery of a misplaced needle. Methods: A survey was administered to minimally inva-sive surgeons across the United States to glean observa-tions on the incidence of lost <b>surgical</b> <b>needles</b> and recov-ery techniques. Survey results were incorporated into an evidence-based protocol designed to expedite the recov-ery of lost <b>surgical</b> <b>needles.</b> Results: Three hundred five minimally invasive surgeons from 11 surgical subspecialties completed the survey. Six-ty-four percent of participants reported having experi-enced a lost surgical needle, {{with a minimum of}} 112 needles lost during the past 1 year alone. Urologists, pediatric surgeons, and bariatric surgeons reported higher rates of needle loss than surgeons practicing other sub-specialties (P. 001). Removal of a needle through a minimally invasive port and laparoscopic suturing were the 2 most common situations resulting in lost needles. A systematic visual search, abdominal radiography, fluoros-copy, and the use of a magnetic retriever were reported as the most successful strategies for needle recovery. Conclusions: On the basis of survey results and current literature, our protocol incorporates a camera survey of the abdomen, intraoperative fluoroscopic radiography, port inspection, and a quadrant-based systematic visual search for the recovery of needles lost during minimally invasive surgery...|$|E
