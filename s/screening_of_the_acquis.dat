40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>the</b> genealogy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>acquis</b> communautaire <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European Union (EU). Acquis communautaire is {{a phrase}} that defies easy translation into English. At times it has been rendered simply as “Community patrimony. ” Academics have tended to leave it untranslated, but to describe it in greater detail. For example, Philippe Schmitter defined acquis communautaire as “the sum total of obligations that have accumulated since <b>the</b> founding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [European Coal and Steel Community] and are embedded in innumerable treaties and protocols. ” Roger Goebel is perhaps best at capturing <b>the</b> “settled” quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>acquis,</b> if one may borrow that term from jurisprudence. He states that the “acquis communautaire essentially conveys {{the idea that the}} institutional structure, scope, policies and rules <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Community (now Union) are to be treated as ‘given’ (‘acquis’), not to be called into question or substantially modified by new states at the time they enter. This paper has three parts. Part one discusses <b>the</b> conceptualization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> “standard <b>of</b> civilization. ” It shows that <b>the</b> “standard <b>of</b> civilization” took three forms in European politics before the Second World War: a legal doctrine, a device to sort regimes and peoples, and a hegemonic ideal. Part two investigates <b>the</b> demise <b>of</b> <b>the</b> “standard <b>of</b> civilization” and <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> this collapse on European identity during the mid-twentieth century.
