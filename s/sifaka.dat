5|$|The social {{structure}} of the golden-crowned <b>sifaka</b> {{is very similar to}} that of Verreaux's <b>sifaka,</b> both averaging between five and six individuals per group, with a range between three and ten. Unlike the Verreaux's <b>sifaka,</b> group sex ratios are more evenly balanced, consisting of two or more members of both sexes. Females are dominant within the group, and only one female breeds successfully each season. Males will roam between groups during the mating season.|$|E
5|$|Only eight {{species of}} lemur {{are known to}} be seed predators (granivores), but this may be under-reported since most {{observations}} only report fruit consumption and do not investigate whether the seeds are consumed as well. These lemurs include some indriids, such as the diademed <b>sifaka</b> (Propithecus diadema), the golden-crowned <b>sifaka</b> (Propithecus tattersalli), the indri, and the aye-aye. The aye-aye, which specializes in structurally defended resources, can chew through Canarium seeds, which are harder than the seeds that New World monkeys are known to break open. At least 36genera from 23families of plants are targeted by lemur seed predators.|$|E
5|$|Some lemurs exhibit female philopatry, where females {{stay within}} their natal range and the males migrate upon {{reaching}} maturity, {{and in other}} species both sexes will migrate. In some cases, female philopatry may help explain the evolution of female-bonded multi-male groups, {{such as those of}} the ring-tailed lemur, Milne-Edwards' <b>sifaka</b> (Propithecus edwardsi), and the Verreaux's <b>sifaka.</b> Their ancestors may have been more solitary, with females that lived in mother-daughter pairs (or dyads). Over time, these dyads may have allied themselves with other neighboring mother-daughter dyads in order to defend more distributed resources in a wide home range. If this is true, then multi-male groups in lemurs may differ fundamentally in their internal structure from those in catarrhine primates (Old World monkeys and apes).|$|E
50|$|A {{study at}} Duke University’s Primate Center {{examined}} feeding behaviors of captive <b>sifakas</b> {{to determine their}} handedness. Given chopped fruits and vegetables, adult male and female <b>sifakas</b> showed a predominant preference for left-handedness, while younger <b>sifakas</b> alternated hands to grab food. The study reveals that Coquerel’s <b>sifakas</b> gain dexterity and hand preference with age, diverging only slightly by gender.|$|R
50|$|Milne-Edwards' <b>sifakas</b> become {{sexually mature}} at 2 or 3 years or age. Milne-Edwards' <b>sifakas</b> have one mating season {{annually}} during the austral {{summer in the}} months of December and January. Females give birth during the austral winter months of May and July after a 179-day gestation.|$|R

5|$|Lemurs {{vary greatly}} in size. They include the {{smallest}} primates {{in the world}} and, until recently, also included some of the largest. They currently {{range in size from}} about 30g (1.1oz) for Madame Berthe's mouse lemur (Microcebus berthae) up to 7–9kg (15–20lb) for the indri (Indri indri) and diademed <b>sifaka</b> (Propithecus diadema). When recently extinct species are considered, the size range extended up to that of a gorilla at 160–200kg (350–440lb) for Archaeoindris fontoynonti.|$|E
5|$|Since cone cells make {{color vision}} possible, the high {{prevalence}} of rod cells in lemur eyes suggest {{they have not}} evolved color vision. The most studied lemur, the ring-tailed lemur, {{has been shown to}} have blue-yellow vision, but lacks the ability to distinguish red and green hues. Due to polymorphism in opsin genes, which code for color receptivity, trichromatic vision may rarely occur in females of a few lemur species, such as Coquerel's <b>sifaka</b> (Propithecus coquereli) and the red ruffed lemur (Varecia rubra). Most lemurs, therefore, are either monochromats or dichromats.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the golden-crowned <b>sifaka</b> {{consists}} {{of a wide variety}} of plants—as many as 80species—whose availability varies based on the season. It is a seed predator, making seeds a year-round staple in its diet when available. The golden-crowned <b>sifaka</b> also eats unripe fruits, flowers, and leaves. One study showed a diet composition of 37%unripe fruit and seeds, 22%immature leaves, 17%mature leaves, 13%flowers, and 9%fruit pulp. Individuals have also been observed consuming tree bark during the dry season. In general, approximately 60% of its diet {{consists of}} unripe fruits and seed, mainly from leguminous pods, and less than 50% consists of leaves. At Daraina, it has been observed feeding on the sakoa tree (Poupartia caffra) and on mango trees. Immature leaves and flowers are eaten when available, in the early wet season. Daily traveling distance tends to increase when immature leaves are available. Studies have also shown that when food distribution is patchy, feeding times are shorter and more time is spent traveling. Dietary diversity has been shown to be consistent between populations, suggesting that it is important for the lemur to get a varied mix of nutrients and to protect itself from high levels of specific plant toxins.|$|E
50|$|The Milne-Edwards' <b>sifaka's</b> diet is {{composed}} primarily of both mature and immature leaves and seeds, {{but they also}} regularly consume flowers and fruit. They also supplement their diet with soil and subterranean fungus. In the process of foraging, the Milne-Edwards' <b>sifakas</b> range an average of 670 m per day.|$|R

5|$|Although {{they lack}} a fovea, some diurnal lemurs have a cone-rich, {{although}} less clustered, area centralis. This area centralis {{has a high}} rod-to-cone cell ratio in many diurnal species studied thus far, whereas diurnal anthropoids have no rod cells in their fovea. Once again, this suggests lower visual acuity in lemurs than in anthropoids. Furthermore, the rod-to-cone cell ratio can be variable even among diurnal species. For instance, Verreaux's <b>sifaka</b> (Propithecus verreauxi) and the indri (Indri indri) {{have only a few}} large cones scattered along their predominantly rod-dominated retina. The eyes of the ring-tailed lemur contain one cone to five rods. Nocturnal lemurs such as mouse lemurs and dwarf lemurs, on the other hand, have retinas made up entirely of rod cells.|$|E
5|$|Bark {{and plant}} exudates such as tree sap are {{consumed}} {{by a few}} lemur species. The exploitation of exudates {{has been reported in}} 18 plant species and only in the dry regions in the south and west of Madagascar. Only the Masoala fork-marked lemur (Phaner furcifer) and Coquerel's giant mouse lemur regularly consume tree sap. Bark has never been reported as an important food item in lemur diets, but at least four species eat it: the aye-aye, the red-tailed sportive lemur (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), the common brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus), and Verreaux's <b>sifaka</b> (Propithecus verreauxi). Most bark feeding is directly linked to exudate feeding, except for the aye-aye's bark feeding on Afzelia bijuga (genus Afzelia) at Nosy Mangabe in the northeast.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{have also}} become popular in Western culture in recent years. The {{original}} 2005 animated film Madagascar {{was seen by}} an estimated 100million people in theaters and 200–300million people on DVD worldwide. Prior to this movie, Zoboomafoo, a Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) children's television series from 1999 to 2001, helped to popularize sifakas by featuring a live Coquerel's <b>sifaka</b> from the Duke Lemur Center {{as well as a}} puppet. A twenty-episode series called Lemur Kingdom (in the United States) or Lemur Street (in the United Kingdom and Canada) aired in 2008 on Animal Planet. It combined the typical animal documentary with dramatic narration {{to tell the story of}} two groups of ring-tailed lemurs at Berenty Private Reserve.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Sifakas</b> (singular [...] "sifaka"; [...] ) are a genus (Propithecus) of lemur {{from the}} family Indriidae within the order Primates. The name of their family is an onomatopoeia of their {{characteristic}} [...] "shi-fak" [...] alarm call. Like all lemurs, they are found only {{on the island of}} Madagascar. All species of <b>sifakas</b> are threatened, ranging from vulnerable to critically endangered.|$|R
5|$|The golden-crowned <b>sifaka</b> is a {{seasonal}} breeder, often mating {{during the last}} week of January. Its gestation period is a little less than six months, and its lactation period is five months. Research has indicated that reproduction is strategically linked with forest seasonality. Gestation starts in the later part of the wet season (late January), and continues for approximately 170 days. Parturition occurs {{in the middle of the}} dry season (late June or July). Weaning occurs during the middle of the wet season, in December, when an abundance of immature leaves is available. It is thought that such reproductive timing exists to ensure adequate protein intake from the immature leaves for both mother and child at the end of the lactation period.|$|E
5|$|While the golden-crowned <b>sifaka</b> faces few {{biological}} threats, such as predation, {{it faces}} many significant human-caused (anthropogenic) threats. Its habitat has been highly fragmented, with forest patches isolated by severely degraded grasslands. By 1985 {{it was estimated}} that 34% of the entire eastern rainforest of the island had disappeared, and by extrapolation it is predicted that at this rate of deforestation there will be no eastern rainforest left by 2020. Illegal logging practices, slash-and-burn agriculture (known as tavy), uncontrolled grass fires, gold mining, poaching, and clearing land for agricultural use have all significantly contributed to the significant deforestation witnessed in Madagascar and the ongoing decline of suitable habitat for this species.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{time their}} mating and birth seasons {{so that all}} weaning periods are {{synchronized}} to match the time of highest food availability. Weaning occurs either before or shortly after the eruption of the first permanent molars in lemurs. Mouse lemurs are able to fit their entire breeding cycle into the wet season, whereas larger lemurs, such as sifakas, must lactate for two months during the dry season. Infant survival in some species, such as Milne-Edwards' <b>sifaka,</b> {{has been shown to}} be directly impacted by both environmental conditions and the rank, age, and health of the mother. The breeding season is also affected by geographical location. For example, mouse lemurs give birth between September and October in their native habitat in the Southern Hemisphere, but from May through June in the captive settings in the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E

5|$|Family Indriidae {{consists}} of the indri (the largest extant lemur), the woolly lemurs and the <b>sifakas.</b> There are 19extant species.|$|R
5|$|After the {{offspring}} are born, lemurs either carry them around or stash them while foraging. When transported, the infants either {{cling to the}} mother's fur or are carried in the mouth by the scruff. In some species, such as bamboo lemurs, infants are carried by mouth until {{they are able to}} cling to their mother's fur. Species that park their offspring include nocturnal species (e.g. mouse lemurs, sportive lemurs, and dwarf lemurs), bamboo lemurs, and ruffed lemurs. In the case of the ruffed lemurs, the young are altricial and the mothers build nests for them, much like the smaller, nocturnal lemur species. Woolly lemurs are unusual for nocturnal lemurs because they live in cohesive family groups and carry their single offspring with them rather than parking them. Alloparenting (multiple or group parenting) has been reported in all lemur families except the sportive lemurs and aye-aye. Allonursing is also known to occur in several lemur groups. Even males have been observed caring for infants in species such as the red-bellied lemur, mongoose lemur, eastern lesser bamboo lemur, silky <b>sifaka,</b> fat-tailed dwarf lemur, and ruffed lemurs.|$|E
5|$|Although lemur {{taxonomy}} had developed, it was {{not until}} the 1950s and 1960s that the in-situ (or on-site) study of lemur behavior and ecology began to blossom. Jean-Jacques Petter and Arlette Petter-Rousseaux toured Madagascar in 1956 and 1957, surveying many of its lemur species and making important observations about their social groupings and reproduction. In 1960, the year of Madagascar's independence, David Attenborough introduced lemurs to the West with a commercial film. Under the guidance of John Buettner-Janusch, who founded the Duke Lemur Center in 1966, Alison Jolly traveled to Madagascar in 1962 to study the diet and social behavior of the ring-tailed lemur and Verreaux's <b>sifaka</b> at Berenty Private Reserve. The Petters and Jolly spawned a new era of interest in lemur ecology and behavior and were shortly followed by anthropologists such as Alison Richard, Robert Sussman, Ian Tattersall, and many others. Following the political turmoil of the mid-1970s and Madagascar's revolution, field studies resumed in the 1980s, thanks in part to the renewed involvement of the Duke Lemur Center under the direction of Elwyn L. Simons and the conservation efforts of Patricia Wright. In the decades that followed, huge strides have been made in lemur studies and many new species have been discovered.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sifaka,</b> {{a type of}} lemur, and {{possibly}} some other primates (possible limited gliding/parachuting). A number of primates have been suggested to have adaptations that allow limited gliding and/or parachuting: sifakas, indris, galagos and saki monkeys. Most notably, the <b>sifaka,</b> a type of lemur, has thick hairs on its forearms that have been argued to provide drag, and a small membrane under its arms that has been suggested to provide lift by having aerofoil properties.|$|E

25|$|The sixth {{book of the}} series, Artemis Fowl: The Time Paradox, was {{released}} in the United Kingdom on 7 August 2008 and in the United States on 15 July 2008. Artemis's mother, Angeline Fowl, becomes ill with Spelltropy, and the only cure lies in the brain fluids of the silky <b>sifaka</b> lemur, the last of which Artemis selfishly killed when he was ten to procure money to fund the expedition to search his father. N°1 sends Artemis and Holly to the past, where Artemis must battle his former self to recover the last silky <b>sifaka</b> lemur before the younger Artemis kills it in a business transaction with Damon Kronski, {{the leader of the}} Extinctionists. Things get more complicated when Opal Koboi is revealed to be controlling the Extinctionists, feeding on the fluids of many extremely rare animals, in order to grant her special abilities and extraordinary prowess in certain fields.

500|$|In 2004, Mayor et al. {{showed that}} despite having a similar {{karyotype}} (the number and appearance of chromosomes) of 42chromosomes (2n=42), the silky <b>sifaka</b> was {{distinct from the}} diademed <b>sifaka.</b> [...] This was shown through genetic tests (D-loop sequencing) and by comparing external proportions. [...] For example, the silky <b>sifaka</b> has a shorter tail. [...] Their analysis indicated a closer relationship with Perrier's <b>sifaka</b> (Propithecus perrieri). [...] Russell Mittermeier and colleagues followed by adopting the full species status of the silky <b>sifaka</b> for the second edition of Lemurs of Madagascar in 2006. [...] Although Groves maintained the silky <b>sifaka</b> as a subspecies in the 3rd edition of Mammal Species of the World in 2005, he recognized it as a distinct species in 2007 by acknowledging the work of Mayor et al. and also noting the additional distinction that the silky <b>sifaka</b> has relatively long molar teeth compared {{to the length of}} its toothrow. [...] Despite the promotion to full species status, the silky <b>sifaka</b> is still considered {{to be a member of}} the P.diadema group of four closely related, large-bodied, eastern-rainforest sifakas.

[...] The species status of the silky <b>sifaka,</b> as well as other sifakas, does not have universal support: in 2007, Tattersall argued against species distinctions within Propithecus, claiming the decisions were made prematurely.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} contains {{three studies}} of acoustic and olfactory communication in {{several species of}} nonhuman primates. The first is a longitudinal study of "gecker" distress vocalizations in infant rhesus monkeys (Macaca mullata) during the first 24 months of life. Acoustic and behavioral analyses revealed age, sex, and maternal response differences across several temporal, spectral, and amplitude measures, but little context-specific acoustic differentiation. Female geckers showed higher spectral peaks and bout durations, while male geckers were higher in amplitude and less noisy. Developmentally, gecker usage peaked at four months of age for both sexes, with male geckers nonetheless tending to occur at younger ages than those of females. In sum, gecker acoustics appear to be well designed to draw the attention of mothers and other listeners, while also potentially becoming aversive. The second study examines the acoustic structure and function of "zzuss" vocalizations in wild silky <b>sifakas</b> (Propithecus candidus) in northeastern Madagascar. Acoustically, the calls combined separate turbulent noise and tonal components, often including frequency jumps and rapid, highly frequency-modulated components. Although silky <b>sifakas</b> are sexually monomorphic, male and female zzuss calls were acoustically different, most importantly in fundamental frequency and amplituderelated features. All acoustic measures differed between individuals, with fundamental frequency related variables again playing the largest role. Overall, zzuss calls are multi-function vocalizations used both for terrestrial disturbance and group coordination. They are shaped for salience, localizability, and caller identification, rather than to have word-like meaning. The final study examines non-nutritive tree gouging by wild silky <b>sifakas</b> (P. candidus) and Milne-Edwards' <b>sifakas</b> (P. edwardsi). Species {{differences were found in}} gouge mark morphology. Dominant males had longer gouge marks and gouged most frequently, with seasonal peaks just before and during the mating season. The resource gouging hypothesis was tested and supported in silky <b>sifakas.</b> A multiple regression analysis revealed that the number of gouges per tree species was predicted by the percentile rank of those species as food tree species and sleep tree species. Gouging appears to be an honest species specific signal of male status which may promote scent longevity and attract the visual attention of conspecifics...|$|R
