5|$|Patronage is {{believed}} to have lapsed from the Sedley family to the Archbishop of Canterbury and then to Sir Joseph Aylosse before being conveyed by gift from a Mr. Serjeant Moses to the charity of the president and governors of Christ's Hospital in London in gratitude for a University of Cambridge scholarship he had received. As late as 1798 the parish was still paying its traditional castle-guard rent to Dover Castle and retained a court baron; this fee was a <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> feudal obligation requiring the provision of knights to defend the castle.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, McCaw was {{selected}} in the New Zealand under-19 squad (coached by Mark Shaw), which won the world championship in Wales. During that series, McCaw realised his All Blacks dream could be attainable. The following year he {{was selected}} in the New Zealand under-21 squad and debuted for Canterbury in the National Provincial Championship (NPC) against North Harbour. On 31 March 2001, he made his Super Rugby debut with the Crusaders, playing a few minutes in a losing effort against the Hurricanes. That year he only played twice for the Crusaders, both times as a <b>substitute,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> total of just eight minutes playing time. He did however play a full season with NPC champions Canterbury and captained the New Zealand Under 21s.|$|E
5|$|Set in the People's Republic of China {{during the}} 1990s, the film {{centers on a}} 13-year-old {{substitute}} teacher, Wei Minzhi, in the Chinese countryside. Called in to <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> village teacher for one month, Wei is told not to lose any students. When {{one of the boys}} takes off in search of work in the big city, she goes looking for him. The film addresses education reform in China, the economic gap between urban and rural populations, and the prevalence of bureaucracy and authority figures in everyday life. It is filmed in a neorealist/documentary style with a troupe of non-professional actors who play characters with the same names and occupations as the actors have in real life, blurring the boundaries between drama and reality.|$|E

25|$|Waxing is a {{mechanical}} {{process that is}} performed {{with the intention of}} plucking the hair, which also functions as {{a mechanical}} exfoliant. It can be done every two to eight weeks.

40|$|The period 1997 – 2000 saw a rapid global {{consolidation}} of crop seed companies.

25|$|In Italian, an {{apostrophe}} {{is sometimes}} {{used as a}} <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> grave or an acute accent after a final vowel: in capitals, or when the proper form of the letter is unavailable.

In some cases, the archaic or potential presence of a word can contribute to its eligibility.|$|E

If the performer retains the 13th in the chord and/or avoids playing a 13th, it can be <b>substituted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> C139. Likewise a C9 can often be <b>substituted</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Cmaj95, as long as the 9th is retained or the 9th and 9th is avoided.|$|R

25|$|One <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> swift is to {{have someone}} else hold the hank. This has several {{disadvantages}} however, first a willing second person has to be found, and secondly unless the other person has {{had a lot of}} practice holding hanks, the yarn winds off a swift much better. Yarn tends to catch on the hands and wristwatches of the person holding the hank, and a swift has neither hand nor watch to catch the yarn.|$|E

25|$|Nair is {{an example}} of a {{chemical}} hair removal product which also functions as a chemical exfoliant. It is done more frequently than waxing (once a week rather than once a month) since it only destroys hair partially below the skin, rather than destroying the entire root as with waxing. Using it weekly can <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> weekly exfoliant regime. It is a very aggressive chemical and cannot be used on the face so other exfoliants would need to be used on the face.|$|E
25|$|Somma {{was named}} in the Leeds squad for the Football League Trophy game against Darlington, and made his debut when he came on as a second-half substitute.

After working his way back from injury and scoring regularly in the reserves, Somma returned to the Leeds first team squad when he was named as a <b>substitute</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> game against Leyton Orient on 23 November 2009.|$|E
