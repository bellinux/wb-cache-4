5|$|Ruffed lemurs use alarm {{calls that}} {{differentiate}} between ground and aerial predators. For instance an abrupt roar or huff alerts {{the group to}} an avian predator, and a pulsed squawk or growl-snort communicates {{the existence of a}} mammalian ground predator. When sounding these calls, such as the pulsed squawk, adults direct them at the predator after moving to a <b>safe</b> <b>position.</b> Once the alarm call is sounded by one individual, the resulting chorus can even reach the furthest ranging community members.|$|E
5|$|The shuttle {{has moved}} into direct {{sunlight}} and Mission Control is unable to rotate it into a <b>safe</b> <b>position,</b> putting the astronauts' lives in danger. Generoo believes that the uplink is being sabotaged. Belt orders the uplink to be cut, allowing the astronauts to rotate the craft manually. Over the objections of Generoo and the agents, Belt orders the mission to proceed and lies to the press about its progress. Belt tells Mulder that the shuttle program may be cancelled if the mission is not completed successfully.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, when the track was still damp in some sections, Vettel set the fastest {{time of the}} night, a lap of 1:46.660 on super-soft tyres; Webber finished with the second fastest lap. Button drove aggressively and battled Vettel for the fastest time throughout before he ended with the third quickest lap, half a second off Vettel's pace. Alonso, who was fourth fastest, ran wide at turn 17 while on a quick lap and slid down the access road at the next corner; he stalled while attempting to rejoin the track and abandoned his car requiring marshals to push his Ferrari away from the track. Hamilton was fifth, with Barrichello and Massa in sixth and seventh places. The two Mercedes drivers were eighth and tenth; with Nico Rosberg ahead of Schumacher, separated by Kubica. Sutil's Force India was launched into the air when he hit a kerb at the Singapore Sling chicane and his front-left suspension was broken upon landing requiring him to miss half the session, and Alguersuari's left-rear tyre made contact with a barrier but he avoided major damage to his car. Sutil was fined US$10,000 (£6,300) by the stewards because he attempted to drive back to the pit lane in his damaged car and did not stop at a <b>safe</b> <b>position</b> on the circuit.|$|E

25|$|The Contender frame has two firing pins, and a {{selector}} on {{the exposed}} hammer, {{to allow the}} shooter to choose between rimfire or centerfire firing pins, or to select a safety position from which neither firing pin can strike a primer.

25|$|Castling is an {{important}} goal in the opening, because it serves two valuable purposes: it moves the king into a <b>safer</b> <b>position</b> away {{from the center of}} the board, and it moves the rook to a more active position in the center of the board (it is even possible to checkmate with castling).|$|R
25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Grand Duke Andrei joined {{the staff at the}} headquarters of the Northwestern front fighting against Germany. It was a relatively <b>safe</b> <b>position</b> away from combat. On 7 May 1915, he became Commander of the Horse Guard Artillery brigade. This meant little, as the batteries were scattered in many places and were not a united command. He was made Major-General on 15 August 1915 and served as chief of the 130th Infantry Regiment of Kherson. His military duties were ill-defined {{and he was able to}} spend much idle time in Saint Petersburg retaking his social life with Kschessinska. Empress Alexandra took notice, complaining to Nicholas II.|$|E
25|$|The P345, {{released}} in 2004, incorporates an integrated keyed lock that locks the {{safety in the}} <b>safe</b> <b>position,</b> a loaded chamber indicator, and a magazine disconnect that blocks the firing pin when the magazine is removed. It also has many ergonomic improvements, such as a new polymer frame design (narrower than the double column derived P90 and P97) and low-profile safety levers. It does not feature an ambidextrous slide release or magazine release. Both controls are designed for a right-handed shooter. The model P345PR adds a Picatinny rail to the frame, for mounting lights and other accessories. It {{was designed to be}} legal for sale in states that require elaborate safety measures.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{models have}} an ambidextrous manual safety/decocker {{located on the}} slide; when the safety lever is lowered to the <b>safe</b> <b>position,</b> the firing pin is cammed into the slide away from the hammer, the trigger is disconnected from the sear, and the hammer is decocked. The decocker models have no manual safety; instead, when the lever is lowered, it only cams the firing pin into the slide and drops the hammer. When the lever is released, the firing pin springs back to the normal position. The DAO models have no manual safety or decocker. All models feature an automatic firing pin safety that blocks the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully rearward.|$|E

25|$|The crew {{launched}} straight away. After their 11-hour journey across Exmoor, {{they now}} had to row for an hour into the storm to reach the Forrest Hall which was anchored close to Hurlstone Point. The lifeboat stood by – the crew rowing continuously to hold a <b>safe</b> <b>position</b> – until daylight when two tugs arrived and {{managed to get a}} new rope across. Some of the lifeboatmen went on board to help raise the anchors as the crew were too tired to do it themselves. The tugs took it across the channel to Barry, accompanied by the Louisa and the Lynmouth lifeboat volunteers in case there were further problems. They finally arrived in port at about 05:00 on 14 January. The lifeboat crew were towed back to Lynmouth by a steam ship.|$|E
25|$|According to Jean Jacques Pelet, one of Masséna's staff officers, Loison was an intriguer. On {{at least}} one {{occasion}} Loison expressed his dissatisfaction with Ney, while another time the marshal unfairly blamed Loison for exposing his artillery to capture. On 22 March, when the army had nearly reached a <b>safe</b> <b>position,</b> Ney flatly refused to obey Masséna's orders and was dismissed. Command of the VI Corps passed to Loison, who led the corps at the Battle of Fuentes de Onoro on 3 to 5 May 1811. During the battle he supervised 17,406 troops in three divisions led by Jean Gabriel Marchand, Julien Augustin Joseph Mermet, and Ferey. On 3 May Ferey battered at the village of Fuentes de Onoro in vain. After a day's pause in the action, Masséna ordered Ferey to attack the village again on the 5th, supported by IX Corps. Meanwhile, Loison's other two divisions, {{the bulk of the}} French cavalry, and a third infantry division attempted an envelopment of the Anglo-Portuguese right flank. After some tough fighting, the French attacks were stopped. Soon after the battle Marshal Auguste Marmont replaced Masséna and did away with the corps organization, leaving Junot, Marchand, Mermet, and other generals without employment.|$|E
500|$|The {{characters}} Hepburn played were, {{with very}} few exceptions, wealthy and intelligent, and often strong and independent. These tough characters tended to be humbled in some form and revealed to have a hidden vulnerability. Garson Kanin described what he called [...] "the formula for a Hepburn success: A high-class, or stuck-up ... girl is brought down to earth by an earthy type, or a lowbrow ... or a cataclysmic situation. It seems to have worked time and time again." [...] Due to this repeated character arc, Britton sees Hepburn as embodying the [...] "contradictions" [...] of the [...] "nature and status of women", as the strong females she depicts are eventually [...] "restored to a <b>safe</b> <b>position</b> within the status quo". Film critic Molly Haskell has commented {{on the importance of}} this to Hepburn's career: with an intimidating presence, it was necessary that her characters [...] "do some kind of self-abasement, to stay on the good side of the audience." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{considered}} {{this for a}} long time without reaching a decision, for there were some in the party to argue on either side of the question.

500|$|Diane Hamer likens Bannon's {{work to the}} Mills and Boon of lesbian literature, {{but unlike}} {{conventional}} romance novels, her stories never really have neat and tidy conclusions. Hamer also takes note of Bannon's use of Freudian symbolism: in I Am a Woman, Jack frequently mentions that he is being psychoanalyzed, and his friends react with interest. Jack labels Laura [...] "Mother" [...] and continues to refer to this nickname instead of her real name throughout the series, as though Bannon—through Jack—is vaguely mocking Freud and the ideas that have framed the construction of sexuality in the 1950s. Scholar Michele Barale remarks that Bannon's literary devices in Beebo Brinker defy {{the expectations of the}} audience for whom the novel was specifically marketed: heterosexual males. Bannon chooses the first character, an [...] "everyman" [...] named—significantly—Jack Mann, with whom the male audience identifies, only to divulge that he is gay and has maternal instincts. His interest turns to Beebo, whom he finds [...] "handsome" [...] and lost, and he takes her home, gets her drunk, and becomes asexually intimate with her. Barale writes that Bannon manipulates male readers to become interested in the story, then turns them into voyeurs and imposes homosexual desires upon them, though eventually places them in a <b>safe</b> <b>position</b> to understand a gay story from a heterosexual point of view.|$|E

2500|$|The 35th {{and final}} frame lasted 68 minutes. In that frame Davis led 62–44, {{with only the}} last four [...] on the table, worth 22 points. Taylor stayed in {{contention}} by potting a very difficult brown from long range, followed by a tricky blue and pink. This meant that, for the first time, the title would be decided on the very last ball, the black. Taylor tried to double it into the left middle pocket; he missed, but the ball rebounded to a <b>safe</b> <b>position</b> {{at the top of}} the table. Davis then played an excellent safety shot, putting the black near the middle of the baulk (bottom) cushion and leaving the cue ball near the right-hand cushion, a little above the corner pocket. Taylor then half-attempted to double the black into the top-left corner pocket but missed, with the black rebounding up and down the table, eventually sneaking past the left middle pocket to a relatively <b>safe</b> <b>position.</b> As the applause died down from the audience, veteran commentator Ted Lowe remarked, [...] "I'm sure Dennis wouldn't mind my saying he chanced his arm, and it's come out lucky". Davis's next attempt went awry, as a double-kiss left Taylor with a reasonable middle-distance pot to the green corner pocket. However, he snatched somewhat at the shot and missed the pot ("the biggest shot of his life", as commentator Jim Meadowcroft described it). Taylor thought, in his disappointment, that he had left Davis a moderately easy cut on the black into the top pocket from fairly close range. However, that pot was at a thinner angle than Taylor had anticipated as he tried to judge where the balls would finish up.|$|E
5000|$|Its {{primary use}} is as a balance weight which {{is added to}} the {{crankshaft}} of an automotive engine, where the existing counterweight is not large enough to compensate for the weight of the reciprocating and rotating components attached to the crankshaft's connecting rod journals.Rather than add to the counterweight by welding or fabrication, holes are drilled in structurally <b>safe</b> <b>positions</b> in the counterweights, and [...] "slugs" [...] (cylindrical dowels) of Mallory metal are inserted and fastened securely.|$|R

2500|$|... 1963–64 saw a tour to Australia by South Africa. Lawry began {{well with}} 43 and 87* in a drawn First Test at Brisbane {{overshadowed by the}} no-balling of Ian Meckiff. Between Tests, the Victorian skipper {{continued}} his strong run with 73 and 130 not against Queensland and 94 against New South Wales. He then made his first century on home soil with 157 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in the first innings of the Second Test. This helped propel Australia to a 173-run first innings lead and an eventual eight-wicket win that gave them a 1–0 lead. He made another half century in the Third Test in Sydney, scoring 89 in the second innings to help Australia to a <b>safe</b> <b>position</b> after they had ceded a 42-run first innings lead. Lawry then struck an unbeaten 187 for Victoria against the South Africans, but his form tailed away in the remaining two Tests, scoring 77 runs {{in the last two}} matches as the tourists won the Fourth Test by ten wickets to square the series. He ended the series with 496 runs at 55.11. The series was highlighted by new ball battles between Lawry and South African pace spearhead Peter Pollock. Pollock attempted to repeatedly bounce Lawry out, but removed Lawry in only three of ten innings. Pollock later nominated Lawry as one of the two hardest openers that he had ever bowled to. The Victorian skipper ended his Sheffield Shield campaign with 119 in a ten-wicket triumph over Western Australia but it was not enough for his team to hold onto their titles. He totalled 1340 runs at 67.00 for the season.|$|E
