5|$|The Mount Washington Observatory {{was built}} on the summit in 1932 through a group {{interested}} in and noting the worth of a research facility at that demanding location. The observatory's weather data have accumulated a climate record since. Temperature and humidity readings have been collected using a <b>sling</b> psychrometer, a simple device containing two mercury thermometers. Where most unstaffed weather stations have undergone technology upgrades, consistent use of the <b>sling</b> psychrometer has helped provide scientific precision to the Mount Washington climate record.|$|E
5|$|Male bikini tops {{also exist}} {{and are often}} used as visual gags. A mankini {{is a type of}} <b>sling</b> {{swimsuit}} worn by men. The term is inspired by the word bikini. It was popularized by Sacha Baron Cohen when he donned one in the film Borat.|$|E

Other winners included Fargo with two awards, and , Dear Diary, Emma, Evita, The Ghost and the Darkness, Independence Day, Jerry Maguire, Kolya, The Nutty Professor, Quest, Shine, <b>Sling</b> Blade, and When We Were Kings with one.|$|E
25|$|Whereas sling-bullets {{are common}} finds in the archaeological record, <b>slings</b> {{themselves}} are rare. This is both because a <b>sling's</b> materials are biodegradable and because <b>slings</b> were lower-status weapons, rarely preserved in a wealthy person’s grave.|$|R

5|$|The {{other two}} stories, those of David and Judith, were often linked in Renaissance art, {{particularly}} by Florentine artists as they demonstrated {{the overthrow of}} tyrants, a popular subject in the Republic. In this image, the shepherd boy, David, has brought down the towering Goliath with his <b>sling,</b> but the giant is alive {{and is trying to}} rise as David forces his head down to chop it off.|$|E
5|$|To {{indicate}} {{the direction of}} a distant earthquake, Zhang's device dropped a bronze ball from one of eight tubed projections shaped as dragon heads; the ball fell into the mouth of a corresponding metal object shaped as a toad, each representing a direction like the points on a compass rose. His device had eight mobile arms (for all eight directions) connected with cranks having catch mechanisms at the periphery. When tripped, a crank and right angle lever would raise a dragon head and release a ball which had been supported by the lower jaw of the dragon head. His device also included a vertical pin passing through a slot in the crank, a catch device, a pivot on a projection, a <b>sling</b> suspending the pendulum, an attachment for the <b>sling,</b> and a horizontal bar supporting the pendulum. Wang Zhenduo (王振鐸) argued that the technology of the Eastern Han era was sophisticated enough to produce such a device, as evidenced by contemporary levers and cranks used in other devices such as crossbow triggers.|$|E
5|$|After enlisting and {{completing}} his basic training at Trentham he was posted to 22nd Reinforcements, 2nd Battalion, Auckland Regiment within the New Zealand Division. Gallaher left New Zealand aboard the Aparima in February 1917 and reached Britain on 2May. Gallaher {{was a member}} of the ship's Sports Committee and spent time organising and practising for a planned rugby match at the Cape of Good Hopeit is unknown if the match ever took place. After arriving in England he was promoted to the rank of temporary sergeant and dispatched to <b>Sling</b> Camp for further training. His rank was confirmed as sergeant on 6June 1917.|$|E

25|$|In {{the ancient}} Andean civilizations such as Inca Empire, <b>slings</b> {{were made from}} llama wool. These <b>slings</b> {{typically}} have a cradle that is long and thin and features a relatively long slit. Andean <b>slings</b> were constructed from contrasting colours of wool; complex braids and fine workmanship can result in beautiful patterns. Ceremonial <b>slings</b> were also made; these were large, non-functional and generally lacked a slit. To this day, ceremonial <b>slings</b> are used {{in parts of the}} Andes as accessories in dances and in mock battles. They are also used by llama herders; the animals will move away from the sound of a stone landing. The stones are not slung to hit the animals, but to persuade them to move in the desired direction.|$|R
5|$|After the meal, Starling {{tries to}} attack Lecter, but he overpowers her. She {{handcuffs}} his wrist to hers. Hearing the police closing in, Lecter threatens to sever her cuffed hand to escape. Lecter is later {{seen on a}} flight with his own boxed lunch, his arm in a <b>sling.</b> As he prepares to eat his meal, including what {{is assumed to be}} part of a cooked brain, a young boy seated next to him asks to try some of his food. Initially reluctant, Lecter then assents.|$|E
5|$|Eddisbury was {{excavated}} between 1935 and 1938 by W. J. Varley, {{who also}} undertook excavations at Maiden Castle nearby, {{as part of}} his investigation into the origin of Cheshire's hill forts. The structure was made a Scheduled Ancient Monument in 1995, giving Eddisbury protection against unauthorised change. The eastern entrance was re-excavated by the Habitats and Hillforts Project in 2010, finds including <b>sling</b> stones and a saddle quern. The excavated walls were partially reconstructed and remain visible.|$|E
5|$|From January to April 1916, Kippenberger {{underwent}} {{basic training}} at Trentham Military Camp {{as part of}} the 12th Reinforcement of the NZEF. On 1 May, he embarked for Europe to join the New Zealand Division. However, during transit his transport ship was unexpectedly diverted to Egypt. For two months, his contingent was based at the training camp of the Australian Imperial Force at Tel-el-Kebir but had {{very little to do with}} only a few hours of training each day. The 12th Reinforcement left in July for <b>Sling</b> Camp in England, where it underwent more intense training.|$|E
25|$|Harnesses for the timpani were {{originally}} just <b>slings.</b> Corps usually used 2 snare <b>slings</b> and hook {{them around the}} player, and onto his timpani. Some corps rigged wooden blocks between the drum and the player, to help balance issues, as the drums were carried high on the body. Some corps used harnesses for a few years, while some continued using <b>slings.</b>|$|R

5|$|Lucullus had {{initially}} {{decided to make}} a running charge with his infantry, a Roman military tactic that minimized the amount of time an enemy could utilize its archers and <b>sling</b> infantry prior to close combat engagement. However, he decided against this at the last moment when he realized that the Armenian cataphracts posed the greatest threat to his men, ordering instead a diversionary attack with his Gallic and Thracian cavalry against the cataphracts.|$|E
5|$|The P90 can {{be fitted}} with a <b>sling</b> for greater ease of carry, and since the weapon has a fixed stock (as opposed to having a {{collapsing}} or folding stock), it can be quickly deployed when needed. The weapon's smooth, rounded contours prevent it from snagging on the shooter's clothing or equipment, and a small vertical protrusion is provided at {{the front end of}} the weapon's frame to prevent the shooter's hand from accidentally slipping in front of the muzzle while shooting. A hollow compartment inside the rear of the weapon's frame—accessed by removing the buttplate—allows for convenient storage of a cleaning kit.|$|E
5|$|The pony is {{typically}} a 2- to 5-litre cylinder. Its capacity determines {{the depth of}} dive and decompression duration for which it provides protection. Ponies may be fixed to the diver's buoyancy compensator (BC) or main cylinder behind the diver's back, or can be clipped to the harness at the diver's side or chest or carried as a <b>sling</b> cylinder. Ponies provide an accepted and reliable emergency gas supply but require that the diver is trained to use them.|$|E
5000|$|Wire rope <b>slings</b> (stranded ropes) {{are used}} to harness various kinds of goods. These <b>slings</b> are {{stressed}} by the tensile forces {{but first of all}} by bending stresses when bent over the more or less sharp edges of the goods.|$|R
60|$|Each {{of these}} men carried three <b>slings,</b> {{one of which was}} used for long {{distance}}s, another when nearer to the foe, the third when close at hand. In action one of these <b>slings</b> was wound round the head, one round the body, the third carried in hand. Their long distance missiles were leaden bullets, and so skilful were they that it is said they could hit with certainty the face of a foe standing at <b>slinging</b> distance.|$|R
60|$|Those {{on board}} the steamer had not been idle. As soon as the yawl was seen {{approaching}} <b>slings</b> were prepared, and no sooner was the hawser securely fixed, than the <b>slings</b> were attached to it and a woman placed in them. The hawser was tight and the descent sharp, and without a check the figure ran down to {{the deck of the}} Seabird. She was lifted out of the <b>slings</b> by Tom and Jack Harvey, who found she was an old woman and had entirely lost consciousness.|$|R
5|$|Upon {{recovery}} {{from the effects of}} his gassing, and aided by the temporary presence of his wife Minnie, Hart returned to England and was placed in command of the New Zealand reserves at <b>Sling</b> Camp in Bulford. Here he was responsible for the training of reinforcements and casualties who were regaining fitness. On 3 June, his leadership of the 4th Brigade was honoured with an appointment as a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, although he took little personal satisfaction in the recognition.|$|E
5|$|While {{designed}} for smartness and equality, the Scout uniform is also practical. Shirts traditionally have thick seams {{to make them}} ideal for use in makeshift stretchers—Scouts were trained to use them in this way with their staves, a traditional but deprecated item. The leather straps and toggles of the campaign hats or Leaders' Wood Badges {{could be used as}} emergency tourniquets, or anywhere that string was needed in a hurry. Neckerchiefs were chosen as they could easily be used as a <b>sling</b> or triangular bandage by a Scout in need. Scouts were encouraged to use their garters for shock cord where necessary.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} ending {{appears in}} the film's DVD version. After Captain Michaels (the Ark 4 captain) announces that they are heading for the Cape of Good Hope, Adrian receives a phone call. He answers the call, and is shocked to recognize the voice as his father's (Harry). Harry tells Adrian that he, his friend Tony (whose left arm is in a <b>sling)</b> and several others survived the megatsunami and are shipwrecked on an island. Adrian informs Captain Michaels of this and the Ark heads for them. Kate thanks Laura {{for taking care of}} Lilly, and Laura tells Jackson that she enjoyed his book. Jackson returns Noah's cell phone, which he recovered during the Ark 4 flood. Lilly says that she sees an island, and the ark finds the shipwrecked cruise ship Genesis and her survivors on a beach.|$|E

60|$|Naked to {{the waist}} they advanced, and with their long {{distance}} <b>slings</b> hurled the leaden bullets at the Roman infantry. When closer they exchanged their <b>slings</b> and discharged from them egg shaped pebbles which they had gathered from {{the bed of the}} Trebia. When within still closer distance with the third <b>slings</b> they poured in volleys of much larger and heavier stones, with such tremendous force that it seemed as though they were sent from catapults. Against such a storm of missiles the Roman skirmishers could make no stand, and were instantly driven back.|$|R

5|$|As an {{implement}} {{of war and}} hunting, javelin throwing began in prehistoric times. Along with the discus, the javelin was the second throwing event in the ancient Olympic pentathlon. Records from 708 BC show two javelin competition types co-existing: throwing at a target and throwing the javelin for distance. It was the latter type from which the modern event derives. In ancient competitions, athletes would wrap an ankyle (thin leather strip) around the javelin that acted as a <b>sling</b> to facilitate extra distance. The javelin throw gained much popularity in Scandinavia in the late 19th century and athletes from the region are still among the most dominant throwers in men's competitions. The modern event features a short run up on a track and then the thrower releases the javelin before the foul line.|$|E
5|$|Fulton led the NZRB {{during the}} {{successful}} Battle of Messines in June 1917, but took ill {{immediately after the}} battle and was hospitalised for several days. Shortly after {{his return to the}} front lines in late July, he was appointed commander of the 4th New Zealand Infantry Brigade Reserve Camp, better known as <b>Sling</b> Camp, for a three-month period. In his absence, the NZRB participated in the Battle of Passchendaele in October. Its morale already low because of the loss of two successive commanders, and lacking in preparation for the latter battle having been employed during the previous month in laying cables and constructing banking, the brigade's losses during Passchendaele were significant. Fulton returned to the brigade in November, and despite his time away, was awarded the Croix de Guerre in December 1917. He had also been mentioned in despatches twice during the year.|$|E
5|$|In some legends, Marko's wonder {{horse was}} a gift from a vila. A Serbian story says that {{he was looking for a}} horse who could bear him. To test a steed, he would grab him by the tail and <b>sling</b> him over his shoulder. Seeing a diseased piebald foal owned by some carters, Marko grabbed him by the tail but could not move him. He bought (and cured) the foal, naming him Šarac. He became an {{enormously}} powerful horse and Marko's inseparable companion. Macedonian legend has it that Marko, following a vilas advice, captured a sick horse on a mountain and cured him. Crusted patches on the horse's skin grew white hairs, and he became a piebald.|$|E
