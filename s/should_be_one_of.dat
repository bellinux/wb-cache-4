A government report in 1967 recommended the adoption of containerisation and that Wellington <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the two New Zealand ports. With containerisation came new roll-on/roll-off cargo handling methods that require more land adjacent to ships' berths. This resulted in the start of an extension to the Aotea Quay reclamation. Reclamation was carried out on both sides of Queens Wharf and the Wellington Harbour Board Container Terminal was created by a large reclamation at Thorndon.|$|E

25|$|According to the {{conclusions}} of two studies published in the United States (one of which was conducted by the Colmar branch of l'INRA (Institut National de Recherche Agronomique or French National Institute for Agricultural Research) on the consequences of global warming for wine-growing, the Loire Valley wine-growing area <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the prime beneficiaries of the gradual increase in temperatures. Basing their calculations on Sotheby's auction statistics, these studies suggest {{that in the last}} ten years the optimum temperature for producing quality wine has already been reached in most French wine-growing areas, but that there is a margin for potential improvement of about 0.8°C along the banks of the Loire. If these conclusions are right, the wines of this region could, in fact, reach their peak without the need for any changes in the grape varieties grown.|$|E
25|$|The {{stand by}} diver will be {{prepared}} {{in the same}} way as the working diver, but will not enter the water until needed. He will usually be prepared to the stage of readiness to enter the water, and then will remove his mask, or have his helmet removed and will then sit in as comfortable a place as can be found, so that in case of an emergency he can be readied for action in as short a time as possible. This often means setting up some form of shelter from the weather, and heat and sunshine are usually more of a problem than cold and wet. It is frequently necessary to cool the standby diver to avoid overheating, and dehydration can also be a problem. When the working diver is using a helmet, the standby diver may use a full face mask or bandmask, as this makes it quicker to get into the water in an emergency. The stand by diver's job is to wait until something goes wrong, and then be sent in to sort it out. For this reason a stand by diver <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the best divers on the team regarding diving skills and strength, but does not have to be expert at the work skills for the specific job. When deployed, the standby diver will normally follow the umbilical of the diver who is in trouble, as unless it has been severed, it will reliably lead to the correct diver. The standby diver must maintain communications with the supervisor throughout the dive and is expected to give a running commentary of progress so that the supervisor and surface crew know as much as possible what is happening and can plan accordingly, and must take the necessary steps to resolve incidents, which may involve supply of emergency air or locating and rescuing an injured or unconscious diver. In bell diving, the bellman is the standby diver, and may have to recover a distressed diver to the bell and give first aid if necessary and possible.|$|E

500|$|Reviews of the episode's {{release on}} DVD were mostly positive, calling the episode [...] "wickedly funny, {{no matter how}} offensive." [...] Frazier Moore of the Associated Press commented that [...] "What, in other hands, {{could have been a}} serious, even heart-wrenching story is on Family Guy a devilish burlesque — not to mention a wickedly astute {{examination}} of the current abortion clash." [...] Moore also noted, however, that [...] "the uninitiated, the faint-of-heart and, most of all, the anti-abortion crowd should maybe choose to take a pass." [...] Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times deemed the episode [...] "typical of that audacious Fox animated comedy, teeming with rapid-fire jokes and willfully offensive non sequiturs about disabled animals, God, Nazis, bodily functions and the sexual habits of 'Sesame Street' characters." [...] In a slightly more mixed review of the DVD release, Cindy White of IGN criticized the episode for its shock value, but appreciated [...] "that the writers didn't cop out in the end, and actually picked a side." [...] White went on to comment that it was [...] "hard to believe that the writers ever expected 'Partial Terms of Endearment' to make it to air" [...] and that [...] "even devoted, longtime fans of the show may be a little uncomfortable with the subject matter." [...] White gave the release a 7 out of 10 rating. Assessing Family Guys impact on television, Mary Elizabeth Williams of Salon commented on the portrayal of abortion: [...] "That Family Guy, that doofy, generally unfunny bastion of sophomoric jokes, <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the few shows brave enough to even address the topic is bananas [...] And that Fox wouldn't air the episode says we're still a long way from having anybody on 'Glee' or 'The Office' or 'House' look at those telltale lines on the stick and finally decide what millions of American women have — that they're just not ready for motherhood." ...|$|E
