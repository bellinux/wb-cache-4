6000|$|CANDIDA. What is it, Eugene--the <b>scrubbing</b> <b>brush?</b> (He shudders.) Well, there! never mind. (She {{sits down}} beside him.) Wouldn't {{you like to}} present me with a nice new one, with an ivory back inlaid with mother-of-pearl? ...|$|E
60|$|She fetched soft soap, and flannel, {{and a new}} <b>scrubbing</b> <b>brush</b> {{from the}} storeroom. But she {{was too tired to}} do any more. First she fell asleep in her chair, and then she went to bed.|$|E
6000|$|CANDIDA (with serious vexation). My own {{particular}} pet <b>scrubbing</b> <b>brush</b> {{has been used}} for blackleading. (A heart-breaking wail bursts from Marchbanks. Burgess looks round, amazed. Candida hurries to the sofa.) What's the matter? Are you ill, Eugene? ...|$|E

50|$|The {{ultrasonic}} {{portion of}} the process {{can be thought of}} as millions of <b>scrubbing</b> <b>brushes</b> working to break down the residues left behind by the surgical process.|$|R
60|$|In the {{afternoon}} {{she took a}} little bag, with shears and sponge and a small <b>scrubbing</b> <b>brush,</b> and went out. It was a grey, wintry day, with saddened, dark-green fields and an atmosphere blackened by the smoke of foundries not far off. She went quickly, darkly along the causeway, heeding nobody, through the town to the churchyard.|$|E
60|$|It was quick, rough bathing. Reaching out for {{the dogs}} nearest him, he flung them in turn into the tub from which they had drunk. When they were frightened, or when they objected in any way, he rapped them {{on the head with}} the <b>scrubbing</b> <b>brush</b> or the bar of yellow laundry soap with which he was {{lathering}} them. Several minutes sufficed for a dog.|$|E
60|$|It {{was very}} beautiful, and novelty lent its charm to the surprise, for art and nature worked a pretty miracle and the clever imitation, first {{heard from a}} kitchen hearth, now became the {{favorite}} in a crowded concert room. Phebe was quite herself again; color in the cheeks now; eyes that wandered smiling to and fro; and lips that sang as gaily and far more sweetly than when she kept time to her blithe music with a <b>scrubbing</b> <b>brush.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{island is}} covered in <b>scrub</b> <b>brush</b> and sand dunes, unlike other Alaskan islands that have hardscrabble coasts. It {{provides}} nesting grounds for sea birds and in the summer is a basking site for seals.|$|R
50|$|Other {{treatments}} include {{putting a}} warm washcloth over the ingrown hair, shaving {{in a different}} direction, exfoliating with facial <b>scrubs,</b> <b>brushes,</b> sponges, towels, salves, or creams containing acids, and ibuprofen or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).|$|R
50|$|Covering {{approximately}} 1300 acre, the playa {{lies in a}} floodplain and is fed {{primarily by}} Big Lake Draw {{and a number of}} other, unnamed smaller draws. <b>Scrub</b> <b>brush,</b> mesquite, juniper, grasses, and water-tolerant hardwoods grow around the lake.|$|R
60|$|MARCHBANKS (softly and musically, but sadly and longingly). No, not a <b>scrubbing</b> <b>brush,</b> but a boat--a tiny shallop to sail away in, {{far from}} the world, where the marble floors are washed by the rain and dried by the sun, where the south wind dusts the {{beautiful}} green and purple carpets. Or a chariot--to carry us up into the sky, where the lamps are stars, and don't need {{to be filled with}} paraffin oil every day.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course not, but I don't see {{the use of}} your having {{seventeen}} waistcoats, endless neckties, and a new hat {{every time}} you come home. I thought you'd got over the dandy period, {{but every now and}} then it breaks out in a new spot. Just now it's the fashion to be hideous, to make your head look like a <b>scrubbing</b> <b>brush,</b> wear a strait jacket, orange gloves, and clumping square-toed boots. If it was cheap ugliness, I'd say nothing, but it costs as much as the other, and I don't get any satisfaction out of it." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{little man}} seemed {{from the first}} much {{attracted}} by his three nieces. Notwithstanding Louise's constant snubs and Beth's haughty silence he was sure to meet them when they strolled {{out and try to}} engage them in conversation. It was hard to resist his simple good nature, and the girls came in time to accept him as an inevitable companion, and Louise mischievously poked fun at him while Beth conscientiously corrected him in his speech and endeavored to improve his manners. All this seemed very gratifying to Uncle John. He thanked Beth very humbly for her kind attention, and laughed with Louise when she ridiculed his pudgy, round form and wondered if his bristly gray hair wouldn't make a good <b>scrubbing</b> <b>brush.</b>|$|E
50|$|Replacing {{the entire}} {{headliner}} fabric is usually necessary as the oxidized foam can prove {{nearly impossible to}} remove from the sagging fabric. In order to do this, a headliner replacement kit, some headliner adhesive, and a <b>scrub</b> <b>brush</b> are needed.|$|R
60|$|They {{had passed}} {{over a small}} plain and were now working along a series of rough rocks {{overgrown}} with <b>scrub</b> <b>brush</b> and creeping vines full of thorns. The thorns stuck everybody but Cujo, who knew exactly how to avoid them.|$|R
50|$|Cypress has two {{distinct}} geographic profiles separated by Highway 290. The area northeast of US 290 is forested and thickly wooded, while the area southwest of 290 is predominately ranch land and grassy prairie dotted with <b>scrub</b> <b>brush,</b> Live oaks and Post oaks.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{always knew}} he would come," [...] said Lena, sitting down on her bundle of bedclothes on the sidewalk. [...] "Last night he came with his armed knights and {{captured}} the ogre's castle. They broke the dishes and kicked down the doors. They pitched Mr. Maloney into a barrel of rain water and threw flour all over Mrs. Maloney. The workmen in the hotel {{jumped out of the}} windows and ran into the woods when the knights began firing their guns. They wakened me up and I peeped down the stair. And then the Prince came up and wrapped me in the bedclothes and carried me out. He was so tall and strong and fine. His face was as rough as a <b>scrubbing</b> <b>brush,</b> and he talked soft and kind and smelled of schnapps. He took me on his horse before him and we rode away among the knights. He held me close and I went to sleep that way, and didn't wake up till I got home." ...|$|E
60|$|You see how {{the game}} goes on. We land and alter things, and build and rearrange, and hoist paper flags on pins, and subjugate populations, and confer all the blessings of civilization upon these lands. We keep them going for days. And at last, as we begin to tire of them, comes the <b>scrubbing</b> <b>brush,</b> and we must burn our trees and {{dismantle}} our islands, and put our soldiers in the little nests of drawers, and stand the island boards up against the wall, and put everything away. Then perhaps, after a few days, we begin upon some other such game, just as we feel disposed. But it is never quite the same game, never. Another time it may be wildernesses for example, and the boards are hills, and never {{a drop of water}} is to be found except for the lakes and rivers we may mark out in chalk. But after one example others are easy, and next I will tell you of our way of making towns.|$|E

50|$|A tawashi (extra=lit., a bundle) is a <b>scrubbing</b> <b>brush</b> for wet cleaning, of a {{style that}} is popular in Japan. Traditionally, tawashis were made of a hemp palm.---- In Japan, sponges used for rubbing and washing are now treated as forms of tawashi.A {{metallic}} tawashi (kinzoku tawashi) is made of metal; steel, stainless steel, and brass are frequent choices.

5000|$|We were cursed, beaten, kicked, and {{compelled}} {{to go through}} exercises {{to the extent that}} a few were unconscious for some minutes.

Mainwaring orders the destruction of the cricket score-board (much to Wilson's annoyance), the allotments (to Frazer's disapproval) and the bandstand (to the dismay of Lance Corporal Jones, who reveals that he was present when it was erected and dedicated to Queen Victoria) within 48 hours. He tells Wilson he is meeting with the Town Clerk to confirm it. However, Mr Rees, the Town Clerk, is less than pleased, and asks for a demonstration.|$|E
50|$|When Mickey {{goes to the}} {{bathroom}} to take a bath, he doesn't notice the seal hop into the tank just before him. Completely unaware of what's around him, Mickey ends up scrubbing the seal's head with his brush instead of his back, which he intended to clean. Mickey eventually realizes that he's not scrubbing himself, but still can't see the seal behind him. The seal then begins scrubbing Mickey's head, which makes Mickey puzzled. Pluto later comes to the window and tries to tell Mickey again, but Mickey shuts the shade. When the seal takes his <b>scrubbing</b> <b>brush,</b> Mickey tries to get it back, only to grab the seal by mistake; he yells with fright upon seeing it. After jumping out of the tub, Mickey drains the water, and only then does he realize there is a seal in the tub.|$|E
