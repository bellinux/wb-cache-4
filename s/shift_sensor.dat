40|$|This paper {{presents}} an autonomous multi-sensor navigation approach for a formation of spacecraft {{flying in the}} proximity of a near Earth asteroid. Each spacecraft embarks a different combination of high resolution cameras, attitude sensors and LIDAR to estimate the stateof each spacecraft in the formation. The work investigates the combination of measurements coming from multiple heterogeneous sensors and nonlinear sequential filtering technique to enable a formation to autonomously navigate in the proximity of asteroids. This work {{is divided into two}} parts. Firstly, each spacecraft employs an Unscented Kalman Filter to data fuse multi-sensor measurements of the relative position of the spacecraft with respect to the asteroid possibly combined with measurements of the relative position of the spacecraft within the formation, thus determining position and velocity of each member. Secondly, the combination of the autonomous orbit determination with absolute measurements is considered. Absolute measurements include range and range rate measurements from the ground station and pseudo range rate measurements from on board Sun Doppler <b>shift</b> <b>sensor.</b> The combination of the two sets of measurements and state estimations from on-board and ground provides an interesting mean to accurately determine the orbit of asteroids...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multi-sensor navigation approach {{to allow a}} formation of spacecraft to autonomously navigate in the proximity of a Near Earth Asteroid. Multiple measurements collected by on-board cameras, attitude sensors and LIDAR are used to estimate the state of each spacecraft {{with respect to the}} asteroid. Inter-spacecraft position measurements are then combined with spacecraft-to-asteroid position measurements to improve accuracy. The paper analyses the use of different filtering techniques to estimate the state of a 4 -spacecraft formation with respect to the asteroid. Different combinations of measurements are constructed to evaluate the improvement in navigation performance offered by the data fusion of the measurements gathered by the four spacecraft. Moreover the robustness of the navigation system is tested against the occurrence of failures. Results show that the navigation performance is significantly improved by adding the inter-spacecraft position measurements. Finally, an asteroid orbit determination method is proposed that combines asteroid's line of sight measurements from multiple spacecraft and Sun Doppler <b>shift</b> <b>sensor</b> with spacecraft-to-ground tracking data. Different approach configurations are evaluated for a 2 -spacecraft formation and it is shown that the integrated use of spacecraft-to-asteroid and ground-to-spacecraft measurements provides an effective way to improve the ephemerides of the asteroid...|$|E

While {{accelerometer}} and tilt sensors {{have been used for}} decades to measure the wave-induced buoy displacements, alternative global positioning system (GPS) sensor packages have been introduced recently that are generally smaller, less expensive, and do not require calibration. In this study, the capabilities of several GPS sensors are evaluated with field observations in wind-sea and swell conditions off the California coast. The GPS buoys used in this study include Datawell Directional Waverider and Mini Directional Waverider buoys equipped with a specialized GPS Doppler <b>shift</b> <b>sensor,</b> and a low-cost experimental drifter equipped with an ‘‘off the shelf’ ’ GPS receiver for absolute position tracking. Various GPS position receivers were attached to the Waverider buoys to evaluate their potential use in low-cost wave-resolving drifters. Intercomparisons be-tween the Datawell GPS-based buoys, the experimental GPS drifter, and a conventional Datawell buoy with an accelerometer–tilt–compass sensor package, show good agreement in estimates of wave frequency and direction spectra. Despite the limited (several meters) absolute accuracy of the GPS position receivers, the horizontal wave orbital displacements are accurately resolved, even in benign (significant wave height less than 1 m) swell conditions. Vertical sea surface displacements were not well resolved by the GPS position receivers with built-in or small patch antennas, but accurately measured when an external precision antenna was attached to the drifter.

According to the equation, {{the relationship between}} the frequency <b>shift</b> of the <b>sensor</b> and the attached mass can be obtained. When the nonlocal effect is not taken into account, the variation of frequency shift with the attached mass on the sensor is compared with the previous study. According to this study, the result shows that the frequency <b>shift</b> of the <b>sensor</b> increases with increasing the attached mass. When the attached mass is small compared with that of the sensor, the nonlocal effect is obvious and increasing nonlocal parameter decreases the frequency <b>shift</b> of the <b>sensor.</b> In addition, when the location of the attached mass is closer to the free end, the frequency shift is more significant and that makes the sensor reveal more sensitive.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Blood was sampled overnight twice per hour in 13 patients. Rapid-acting insulin was given subcutaneously 30 min after breakfast. Sampling once per minute started 45 min after breakfast and 75 min After insulin injection for 30 min, {{with the aim of}} determining peak and nadir glucose values. Mean absolute differences (MADs) between sensor and blood glucose values were calculated. Sensor curves were modeled for all patients using linear regression. Horizontal and vertical shifts of sensor curves from the blood glucose curves were assessed. A vertical shift indicates sensor drift and a horizontal <b>shift</b> <b>sensor</b> delay. RESULTS- Drift was minimal in the needle-type and microdialysis sensors (- 0. 02 and - 0. 04 mmol/l). Mean +/- SD delay was 7. 1 +/- 5. 5 min for the microdialysis sensor (P < 0. 001). MAD was 15. 0 % for the needle-type sensor and 13. 6 % for the microdialysis sensor (P = 0. 013), After correction for the 7 -min delay, the microdialysis MAD improved to 11. 7 % (P < 0. 0001). CONCLUSIONS - The microdialysis sensor was more accurate than the needle-type sensor, with or without correction for a 7 -min delay. In contrast to the previous version, the current needle-type sensor did not exhibit nocturnal hypoglycemic drift. Continuous subcutaneous glucose sensors are valuable adjunctive tools for glucose trend analyses. However, considering the large MADs, individual sensor values should be interpreted with cautio...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} designing an efficient exploration strategy for multiple mobile agents. As an exploration strategy, an intelligent waypoint generation is considered, where the trajectory of the agent is governed by {{the properties of the}} explored phenomenon. Here it is assumed that the explored field is sparse in it’s spatial distribution; consequently, it is assumed that a certain agent’s movement trajectory might favor a sparse solution, as contrasted to simple sampling strategies. Specifically, these trajectories lead to an emergence of a structured sensing matrix consisting of <b>shifted</b> <b>sensor</b> impulse responses. Nevertheless some properties of this matrix, such as low mutual coherence, are essential for a successful sparse reconstruction of the phenomenon. Thus, the agents are directed to move so as to favor the desired properties of the sensing matrix, an approach termed sparse exploration. Unfortunately, numerical techniques for optimization of the sensing matrix are intractable. Therefore this paper proposes a number of heuristics, which numerically optimize the measurement locations of the agents so as to favor a sparse solution. Synthetic experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed heuristics as compared to simple random walk or regular movement patterns...|$|R

40|$|Surface {{electromyography}} (sEMG) is {{a technique}} for recording natural muscle activation signals, which can serve as control inputs for exoskeletons and prosthetic devices. Previous experiments have incorporated these signals using both classical and pattern-recognition control methods in order to actuate such devices. We used {{the results of an}} experiment incorporating grasp and release actions with object contact to develop an intent-recognition system based on Gaussian mixture models (GMM) and continuous-emission hidden Markov models (HMM) of sEMG data. We tested this system with data collected from 16 individuals using a forearm band with distributed sEMG sensors. The data contain trials with shifted band alignments to assess robustness to sensor placement. This study evaluated and found that pattern-recognition-based methods could classify transient anticipatory sEMG signals in the presence of <b>shifted</b> <b>sensor</b> placement and object contact. With the best-performing classifier, the effect of label lengths in the training data was also examined. A mean classification accuracy of 75. 96 % was achieved through a unigram HMM method with five mixture components. Classification accuracy on different sub-movements was found to be limited by the length of the shortest sub-movement, which means that shorter sub-movements within dynamic sequences require larger training sets to be classified correctly. This classification of user intent is a potential control mechanism for a dynamic grasping task involving user contact with external objects and noise.
