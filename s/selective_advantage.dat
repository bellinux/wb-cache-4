5|$|In 1922, Alfred J. Lotka {{proposed}} that natural selection might {{be understood as}} a physical principle that could be described in terms of the use of energy by a system, a concept later developed by Howard T. Odum as the maximum power principle in thermodynamics, whereby evolutionary systems with <b>selective</b> <b>advantage</b> maximise the rate of useful energy transformation.|$|E
5|$|About 10,000 years ago, malaria {{started having}} {{a major impact}} on human survival, coinciding with the start of {{agriculture}} in the Neolithic revolution. Consequences included natural selection for sickle-cell disease, thalassaemias, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, Southeast Asian ovalocytosis, elliptocytosis and loss of the Gerbich antigen (glycophorin C) and the Duffy antigen on the erythrocytes, because such blood disorders confer a <b>selective</b> <b>advantage</b> against malaria infection (balancing selection). The three major types of inherited genetic resistance (sickle-cell disease, thalassaemias, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency) were present in the Mediterranean world {{by the time of the}} Roman Empire, about 2000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, {{selection}} can {{be divided}} according to its effect on genetic diversity. Purifying or negative selection acts to remove genetic variation from the population (and is opposed by de novo mutation, which introduces new variation. In contrast, balancing selection acts to maintain genetic variation in a population, {{even in the absence}} of de novo mutation, by negative frequency-dependent selection. One mechanism for this is heterozygote advantage, where individuals with two different alleles have a <b>selective</b> <b>advantage</b> over individuals with just one allele. The polymorphism at the human ABO blood group locus has been explained in this way.|$|E

40|$|Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen 1 (EBNA 1) is a {{multifunctional}} protein encoded by EBV. EBNA 1 &# 8217;s role {{in maintaining}} EBV in latently proliferating cells, by mediating EBV genome synthesis and nonrandom partitioning to daughter cells, {{as well as}} regulating viral gene transcription, is well characterized.

5|$|Some {{eukaryotic}} protozoa such as Leishmania {{major and}} Trypanosoma cruzi lack the RNAi pathway entirely. Most {{or all of}} the components are also missing in some fungi, most notably the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The presence of RNAi in other budding yeast species such as Saccharomyces castellii and Candida albicans, further demonstrates that inducing two RNAi-related proteins from S. castellii facilitates RNAi in S. cerevisiae. That certain ascomycetes and basidiomycetes are missing RNA interference pathways indicates that proteins required for RNA silencing have been lost independently from many fungal lineages, possibly due to the evolution of a novel pathway with similar function, or to the lack of <b>selective</b> <b>advantage</b> in certain niches.|$|E
5|$|Péron {{stated that}} the nest was usually {{situated}} near water {{and on the ground}} under the shade of a bush. It was constructed of sticks and lined with dead leaves and moss; it was oval in shape and not very deep. He claimed that seven to nine eggs were laid always on 25 and 26 July, but the <b>selective</b> <b>advantage</b> of this breeding synchronisation is unknown. The female incubated the eggs, but the male apparently developed a brood patch, which indicates it contributed as well. The non-incubating parent also stayed by the nest, and the chicks left the nest two to three days after hatching. The eggs were preyed upon by snakes, rats, and quolls. Péron gave the incubation period as five or six weeks, but since the mainland emu incubates for 50 to 56 days, this may be too short. He stated a mother emu would defend its young from crows with its beak, but this is now known to be strictly male behaviour.|$|E
5|$|The act of premastication is {{commonly}} found in all human societies and populations, although it is less prevalent in some than others. The evolution and <b>selective</b> <b>advantage</b> of premastication behaviours is that it supplements the infant diet of breast milk by providing access to more macro- and micro-nutrients. Although disease can be transmitted through saliva in the pre-chewed foods, the benefits conferred outweighed any risks of the practice during the evolution of human behaviour. Furthermore, discouraging premastication as prevention to disease transmittion may prove as disastrous an infant public health policy as when infants breastfeeding was discouraged in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the end, the potential benefits and pitfalls of this practice greatly depend on the dietary and medical circumstances of the mother and child. The true scope {{of the benefits of}} premastication and its prevalences in differenct societies is still under active research, though there appears to be some consensus on the nutritional benefits of the practice.|$|E

40|$|One {{consequence}} of genomic imprinting is that {{loss of the}} transcriptionally active chromosomal homologue causes a change in gene expression that might permit surveillance of chromosome-loss events.

5|$|The {{reason for}} sexual {{cannibalism}} has been debated; experiments show that females on low quality diets {{have a higher}} chance to engage in sexual cannibalism compared to females on high quality diets. Some consider that submissive males gain a <b>selective</b> <b>advantage</b> by producing offspring. This theory {{is supported by a}} quantifiable increase in the duration of copulation among males which are cannibalized, in some cases doubling both the duration and the chance of fertilization. This is contrasted by a study where males were seen to approach hungry females with more caution, and were shown to remain mounted on hungry females for a longer time, indicating that males that actively avoid cannibalism may mate with multiple females. The same study also found that hungry females generally attracted fewer males than those that were well fed. The act of dismounting after copulation is dangerous for males, for at this time, females most frequently cannibalize their mates. An increase in mounting duration appears to indicate that males wait for an opportune time to dismount a hungry female, who would be likely to cannibalize her mate.|$|E

25|$|Pre-adaptation {{may occur}} because a natural {{population}} carries a huge quantity of genetic variability. In diploid eukaryotes, {{this is a}} consequence of the system of sexual reproduction, where mutant alleles get partially shielded, for example, by the <b>selective</b> <b>advantage</b> of heterozygotes.

40|$|AbstractLaboratory {{evolution}} in Escherichia coli {{has revealed that}} fitness typically increases in experimental populations [1, 2]. These changes are sometimes associated with changes in insertion sequence positions, {{some of which may}} themselves cause advantageous phenotypes [3, 4]. We have a novel and general method for identifying genes in Escherichia coli, whose knockout by mobile DNA insertions is beneficial in experimental evolution. Insertion sites in favored clones can be identified by reference to genomic information. We have implemented the method using modified Tn 10 transposons bearing kanamycin and chloramphenicol resistance cassettes. Results are consistent across replicated experiments, demonstrating that the insertions are themselves creating <b>selective</b> <b>advantages,</b> rather than hitch-hiking with favorable base substitutions. The successful clones have subsequently been confirmed to have a fitness advantage relative to the progenitor strain. In experiments in shaking culture, we find that advantageous insertions usually fall in operons required in the pathways creating flagella. The method allows a rapid genome-wide screening for advantageous insertions in arbitrary environmental conditions. It allows investigation {{of the extent to which}} transient mutations generating environment-dependent <b>selective</b> <b>advantages</b> may help to explain the persistence of mobile DNAs in primarily clonal organisms, such as E. coli...|$|R

25|$|Pygmy {{chimpanzees}} (bonobos) {{share many}} physical characteristics with humans. A prime example are their neotenous skulls. The shape of their skull {{does not change}} into adulthood; it only increases in size. This is due to sexual dimorphism and an evolutionary change in timing of development. Juveniles became sexually mature before their bodies had fully developed into adulthood, and due to some <b>selective</b> <b>advantage</b> the neotenic structure of the skull remained in later generations.|$|E
25|$|Evidence {{that the}} cost is surmountable comes from George C. Williams, who noted the {{existence}} of species which are capable of both asexual and sexual reproduction, such as certain lizards. These species time their sexual reproduction with periods of environmental uncertainty, and reproduce asexually when conditions are more favourable. These species are observed to reproduce sexually when they could choose not to, implying {{that there is a}} <b>selective</b> <b>advantage</b> to sexual reproduction.|$|E
25|$|In a {{more recent}} paper, the {{appendix}} {{was found to have}} evolved at least 32 times (and perhaps as many as 38 times) and to have been lost no more than six times.

This complex evolutionary history of the appendix, along with a great heterogeneity in its evolutionary rate in various taxa, suggests that it is a recurrent trait.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAnguillicola crassus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} parasitic invasive species as it has spread from its original habitat in East Asia throughout the world and has acquired five new eel host species in the course of its invasion within the last three decades. Records from an Italian lake indicate that this species has even displaced an established population of its close relative A.  novaezelandiae originating from New Zealand. In order to analyze the reasons for its high invasive potential, this review highlights recent studies, which substantiate the <b>selective</b> <b>advantages</b> of A.  crassus over A.  novaezelandiae. Laboratory infection experiments revealed that A.  crassus features a less synchronized development compared to A.  novaezelandiae in the European eel, which enables this species to emit eggs over a longer period of time. Differences in the time period required for first egg output and in the maturation process of second stage larvae in intermediate hosts could also be detected, which may lead to differences in infection potential. Finally, microsatellite analyses have shown that hybridization processes are possible, but might only occur between A.  crassus males and A.  novaezelandiae females. Taken as a whole, the sum of minor <b>selective</b> <b>advantages</b> and differences in life cycle traits could have considerably contributed to a replacement of one species by the other...|$|R
