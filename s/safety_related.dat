25|$|On March 18, 2017, an {{electrical}} fault {{occurred in a}} Unit 3 switchgear room, resulting {{in the loss of}} a <b>safety</b> <b>related</b> electrical bus and a reactor trip.

There was no threat to local residents or the environment, and the alert, the second-lowest Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) emergency declaration, was terminated later that same day. The electrical fault caused an arc flash, resulting in a minor burn of a plant worker who was in the room and was treated at a local hospital. On March 22, 2017, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission announced that it had initiated a special inspection into the failure of the electrical bus that resulted in the plant declaring an alert.|$|E

40|$|Research in {{workplace}} safety {{has focused}} on either the physical approach that emphasizes ergonomic design {{of the environment and}} work-related equipment, an environmental approach that emphasizes potential hazards such as noise, toxins, and temperature, or a behavioural approach that emphasizes changing employee behaviours that are deemed to be responsible for workplace incidents such as accidents, injuries, fatalities, and safetyrelated events. I built on this research (i) to develop and validate an HPWS for safety scale, and (ii) to propose and test a model of processes through which unit level HPWS for safety influence individual level safety outcomes. This thesis reports the findings of four studies. Three of these studies focused on the development and validation of an HPWS for safety scale while the fourth study used the validated scale to examine the processes through which HR practices influence workplace safety. Data were analyzed using multilevel structural equation modelling (MSEM) with Mplus version 7. 3. The findings revealed that (i) experienced HPWS for <b>safety</b> directly <b>relates</b> to <b>safety</b> behaviours and also indirectly through safety knowledge and safety motivation, (ii) experienced HPWS for <b>safety</b> <b>relates</b> to both safety-specific events and workplace injuries through a mediational chain of safety knowledge and safety compliance, (iii) experienced HPWS for <b>safety</b> <b>relates</b> to workplace injuries through a mediational chain of safety knowledge and safety initiative, (iv) experienced HPWS for <b>safety</b> <b>relates</b> to both safety-related events and workplace injuries via safety motivation and safety compliance, (v) the use of HPWS for <b>safety</b> significantly <b>related</b> to unit <b>safety</b> climate, (vi) the use of HPWS for <b>safety</b> significantly <b>related</b> to experienced HPWS for safety while unit-level safety climate moderated the safety knowledge-safety compliance relationship. Lastly, the findings provide support for the psychometric properties of the scale. I also discussed the theoretical and practical implications of the findings, highlighted the study’s strengths and limitations, and then mapped out some directions for future research...|$|R

2500|$|On February 9, 2012, Transport Canada advised Porter it had {{received}} an Access to Information request for {{what are called}} [...] "Notices of Suspension issues to Porter."

Transport Canada told Porter it was considering releasing some information and wanted a written response from the company detailing why any records should be withheld. Based on Porter's response, the department decided to release a censored version of the material in question. Porter went to court to prevent that from happening. On July 11, 2013 the federal court ruled in Porter's favour and the Confidentiality Order dated September 14, 2012 would remain in effect.

40|$|International audienceThe {{functional}} safety {{is the part}} of the overall <b>safety</b> <b>relating</b> to equipment/ system/ installation and their control systems that depends on the correct functioning of the safety-related systems. Due to the critical role of safety-related systems for managing risks, international standards have been developed to provide guidelines and requirements for all their safety lifecycle activities. The IEC 61508 and IEC 61511 are now recognized all around the world and have become the references for the best practice of {{functional safety}}. However, a decade of on-the-filed functional safety experience has shown that several concepts used in these standards are still subject to common mistakes in their interpretation or implementation, which may result in significant loss of safety. This paper proposes a review of ten common mistakes in functional <b>safety,</b> <b>relating</b> to: <b>Safety</b> Lifecycle (SLC), Functional Safety Management (FSM), Safety Integrity Level (SIL), Safety Requirement Specification (SRS), PFDavg and PFH, System architecture “M-out-of-N” (MooN), “Safe Failure Fraction” (SFF), and Certification.
