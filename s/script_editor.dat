5|$|Written by James Follett, this {{involved}} monsters {{attacking a}} race of beings who live inside Halley's Comet, unaware that there is anything beyond it they believe that their world is the sum and total of the universe. Into the Comet would have used the companions of Romana and K9. Follett was a novelist who pitched this idea to <b>script</b> <b>editor</b> Douglas Adams circa September 1979 when they met up and discussed the forthcoming return of Halley's Comet. Unfortunately the storyline was rejected by Adams. Follett resubmitted Into the Comet to new <b>script</b> <b>editor</b> Christopher H. Bidmead around May 1980, but once again the storyline was not pursued.|$|E

They were hired simultaneous, marking {{the first time}} Doctor Who had female <b>script</b> <b>editors.</b> Rowlands left after the first series for Life on Mars. Compared to the {{original}} series {{the role of the}} <b>script</b> <b>editors</b> was significantly diminished, with the head writer taking most of those responsibilities. Unlike the original series {{they do not have the}} power to commission scripts. Instead, they act as liaisons between the production staff and the screenwriter, before passing their joint work to the head writer for a [...] "final polish". Raynor said that the job is not a creative one, [...] "you are a part of it, but you aren't driving it." ...|$|R

5|$|Genesis of the Daleks was {{originally}} commissioned under producer Barry Letts and <b>script</b> <b>editor</b> Terrance Dicks, {{who felt that}} the outline submitted by Nation was too similar to his previous Dalek adventures, and encouraged him to explore {{the origin of the}} Daleks. The story introduces the Daleks' creator Davros (Michael Wisher), who had a unique visual design. The script was handed to Letts and Dicks' successors, producer Philip Hinchcliffe and <b>script</b> <b>editor</b> Robert Holmes, who made changes to the original script which gave it a darker tone. Nation, having intentionally modelled the Daleks on the Nazis, further explored the theme in Genesis. It also addresses the moral issues that come with time travelling and genocide. The story was filmed over January and February 1975, with some location filming in a quarry in Betchworth.|$|E
5|$|The serial's {{original}} storyline was {{devised by}} Fisher but was heavily re-written by <b>script</b> <b>editor</b> Adams, aided by producer Williams.

5|$|Time Inc was {{the title}} for the {{concluding}} two-part story-arc as to have originally been written by Robert Holmes for episodes 13 & 14 when commissioned on 4 February 1986. However, Holmes was unable {{to work on the}} script past the first part due to his untimely death on 24 May 1986. <b>Script</b> <b>editor</b> Eric Saward was tasked with completing the story, his version of the script ending with the Doctor and the Valeyard locked in battle in the time vortex and no clear victor. This was disapproved by series producer John Nathan-Turner as being too down-beat and would end the show on an inconclusive moment should the BBC decide to cancel the series. The final episode was subsequently commissioned from Pip & Jane Baker by Nathan-Turner after Saward quit as <b>script</b> <b>editor</b> following the rejection of his proposed ending.|$|E
5|$|Written by John Brosnan {{submitted}} {{this idea}} sometime after Bidmead became <b>script</b> <b>editor</b> in January 1980. The story would have involved the Doctor {{arriving at the}} BBC Television Centre and meeting Tom Baker. The two would then pair up to combat a threat.|$|E

The first series and most of the second were adapted in this way, but later series saw only a few releases and a transition from print to e-books.|$|E

5|$|Written by Ben Aaronovitch, {{this story}} {{concerned}} privatisation. This idea was submitted in May 1987, the then <b>script</b> <b>editor</b> Andrew Cartmel liked {{some of the}} concepts, but he {{felt that it was}} generally inappropriate for Doctor Who, and that there were too many supporting characters. However, Andrew Cartmel encouraged Ben Aaronovitch to pitch more stories, and led to the story Remembrance of the Daleks.|$|E
5|$|Written by Brian Hayles, {{this was}} {{submitted}} to the production office {{during the spring of}} 1971. The story involved an Ice Warrior plan to invade the Earth using a 'Z' beam which freezes things it strikes to absolute zero. When used on humans, it turns them into zombie-like slaves. <b>Script</b> <b>editor</b> Dicks rejected the storyline, but the inclusion of the Ice Warriors inspired the development of The Curse of Peladon.|$|E
5|$|Written by Chris Boucher, {{this story}} was an {{unsolicited}} submission sent to the production office in early 1975. Although only fifteen minutes worth of material was considered unsuitable for Doctor Who, <b>script</b> <b>editor</b> Robert Holmes brought in Chris Boucher to discuss ideas with himself and producer Philip Hinchcliffe. This led to unmade scripts for The Dreamers of Phados and The Mentor Conspiracy, before finally being commissioned as The Face of Evil.|$|E

5|$|Written by David Banks, {{the story}} {{involved}} the Sixth Doctor and Peri encountering the Master in Ancient Crete, {{as well as}} a contingent of Cybermen. David Banks, who had played the Cyber Leader in three serials in the early 1980s, submitted this storyline around the time that ‘Attack Of The Cybermen’ entered production in 1984. <b>Script</b> <b>editor</b> Eric Saward liked the idea, but felt that it would prove too expensive to film.|$|E
5|$|Written by Pennant Roberts, this four-part {{story was}} {{commissioned}} on 10 January 1979 as Dragons of Fear. The adventure would involve the planet Erinella {{and two men}} fighting over a princess.

5|$|Chris Boucher {{began his}} {{television}} writing career in comedy, working on such programmes as Dave Allen at Large and Romany Jones, {{before moving on}} to write for drama series, including Shoestring, Juliet Bravo and Bergerac. He was no stranger to television science fiction, having written three serials for Doctor Who and having acted as <b>script</b> <b>editor</b> on the entire four season run of Blake's 7 as well as writing nine episodes for it himself. Boucher originally pitched Star Cops to the BBC in 1981 as a radio series but, with James Follet's epic Earthsearch serial in production that year, it was felt that science fiction was adequately served in the schedules and so Boucher tried to sell it to television instead. He sent the draft script of the first Star Cops story to Jonathan Powell, the Head of Drama at BBC television. Powell responded asking Boucher to write a second script and on the strength of this the series was commissioned. However, Powell insisted that the first story, which Boucher had intended to run over two episodes, be reworked into a single episode. This would be the first of many difficulties Boucher would have with how Star Cops was eventually realised for the screen. Boucher, who at this time was working as <b>script</b> <b>editor</b> on the crime series Bergerac, was also told by Powell he could work on Star Cops or on Bergerac but not on both and so chose to leave Bergerac.|$|E

A novel adaption by James Goss was released by BBC Books in January 2018.|$|E
5|$|Everyone I {{talked to}} {{seemed to have}} a {{relative}} or a friend who'd been through it. That was the other thing – everyone reacts to the problem differently so there's no textbook way of playing Ruth in her present situation. In fact, the way I'm playing her now might surprise some people because in the past she's been such a strong character and here she is collapsed and weeping and thinking the worst. Occasionally you may suggest to the <b>script</b> <b>editor</b> that you don't think your character will react a certain way, but with Ruth I have absolute trust in the scriptwriter's characterisation.|$|E
