40|$|The formal {{accounting}} {{logic of}} the national accounts and other macroeconomic statistics is not always well understood. In addition, the relation between macro statistics and micro accounting data often is not clear. This paper starts out by summarizing the main bookkeeping conventions at the macro level. A distinction is made between vertical and horizontal double-entry bookkeeping, which, if applied simultaneously, result in quadruple-entry bookkeeping. Vertical bookkeeping refers to the double-entry bookkeeping used in business practice. Horizontal bookkeeping requires that the transactions and other economic relationships between agents answer strict consistency rules regarding valuation, timing, and classification. At the micro level, this consistency is not guaranteed.

5|$|In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association listed {{homosexuality}} in the Diagnostic and <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> (DSM) as {{a mental}} disorder.

This view was widely influential in the medical profession. In 1956, however, the psychologist Evelyn Hooker performed a study that compared the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-identified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found no difference. Her study stunned the medical community and made her a hero to many gay men and lesbians, but homosexuality remained in the DSM until 1973.|$|E

5|$|Since medical {{literature}} began to describe homosexuality, {{it has often}} been approached from a view that sought to find an inherent psychopathology as the root cause, influenced by the theories of Sigmund Freud. Although he considered bisexuality inherent in all people, and said that most have phases of homosexual attraction or experimentation, exclusive same-sex attraction he attributed to stunted development resulting from trauma or parental conflicts. Much literature on mental health and lesbians centered on their depression, substance abuse, and suicide. Although these issues exist among lesbians, discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from the Diagnostic and <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> in 1973. Instead, social ostracism, legal discrimination, internalization of negative stereotypes, and limited support structures indicate factors homosexuals face in Western societies that often adversely affect their mental health.|$|E

These criteria require that the presence of cognitive impairment, and a suspected dementia syndrome, be confirmed by neuropsychological testing for a clinical diagnosis of possible or probable AD. A histopathologic confirmation including a microscopic examination of brain tissue is required for a definitive diagnosis. Good statistical reliability and validity have been shown between the diagnostic criteria and definitive histopathological confirmation. Eight cognitive domains are most commonly impaired in AD—memory, language, perceptual skills, attention, constructive abilities, orientation, problem solving and functional abilities. These domains are equivalent to the NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria as listed in the Diagnostic and <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) published by the American Psychiatric Association.|$|E

40|$|The continual {{process of}} mental disease {{classification}} in U. S. psychiatry {{is assumed to}} reflect advancing professional knowledge of these disorders. To date, the American Psychiatric Association has developed four standard classifications, or nosologies, called Diagnostic and <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manuals</b> ('DSMs'). DSM-I, the earliest, appeared in 1952 while the most recent, DSM-III-R, appeared in 1987. This paper employs a cultural constructivist perspective to deconstruct these nosologies and the classificatory process itself. Constructivism's premises, which emphasize culture, history, meaning and the constructed nature of medical phenomena, serve as the framework for the analysis. The paper shows that professional psychiatric classification expresses an underlying cultural psychology which encompasses four phenomenological domains and one of three Western person conceptions. Classifications {{are found to be}} explorations of culturally meaningful etiologies that explain the absence of 'self control', a central ethnopsychological aspect of the idealized self. Consideration of the vantage point of the voice of classification indicates that the ideal self is gender- (male), ethnic- (German Protestant) and age-specific (adult). The ethnic self's essence, and that of the Other, is believed to be biological, itself assumed to be natural and beyond culture or bias. Consequently, the ethnopsychology constructs as biologically caused the real and imagined differences in the gender, age or culturally Other. This invidious ethnobiological essentialism acts to create and maintain self-worth through a radical differentiation of self from those represented as Other. ethnopsychology psychiatric classification ethnopsychiatry United States medical anthropology...|$|R

40|$|M. A. There is a {{critical}} lack of local, clinical research into this growing problem which threatens to affect all of our lives, either directly or indirectly. The last government-sanctioned study on substance abuse in South Africa was conducted in 1970, and very limited research reports have been published that have reflected on the etiology, maintenance and treatment of the problem, either from a social or therapeutic perspective. This dissertation sets out to address the clinical, therapeutic issues of Substance Abuse disorder, including alcohol, within a South African context. The assumption of the author is that pathological personality styles and disorders underlie the problem of substance abuse in South Africa, as {{has been established in}} countries with similar substance abuse issues around the world. As will be seen in the following chapter, a distinct relationship has been established between the disorder of substance abuse, on Axis I and the personality disorders of Axis II, according to the DSM III-R. 4 A review of the literature will demonstrate the different findings surrounding this relationship, and describe the role that pathological personality patterns play in the development and maintenance of Substance Abuse disorder. These pathological personality styles and disorders are then discussed in detail, from the perspective of Millon's theory of personality. It is felt by this author that Millon's theory of personality provides a comprehensive framework for the discussion of the underlying personality issues associated with addiction. The extensive description of Millon's personality styles and disorders, their close association to the personality disorders described in the Diagnostic and <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manuals,</b> and their easy quantification through the MCMI II make Millon's theory, coupled with his test of personality the most well suited theory to form a foundation for the discussion and integration of an understanding of the problems associated with substance abuse in South Africa.
