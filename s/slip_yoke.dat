500|$|Other {{improvements}} {{include the}} change to a manual [...] transmission with six forward speeds (instead of the previous four), and increased stability resulting from wider track axles than its predecessor. Leaf springs were replaced with modern coil spring suspension front and rear, and the Storm II features rear Dana 44 axles and front TJ Dana 30s, factory designed <b>slip</b> <b>yoke</b> eliminators, and the added safety of standard airbags. Soldiers' comfort was addressed {{as well with the}} addition of standard rear air conditioning and a compact disc player.|$|E
50|$|The Dana Holding Corporation {{manufactured}} the TTB axle for Ford. It uses {{a universal}} joint {{in the center}} that allows the wheels to move independently of each other. The differential is offset to the driver's side, and a <b>slip</b> <b>yoke</b> is used on the long axle side to allow the shaft to change length. The TTB axles are variations of the Dana 28, Dana 35, Dana 44, and Dana 50.|$|E

50|$|Applications {{for use in}} this {{industry}} {{take full advantage of}} the many benefits electroless nickel has to offer. Deposit properties such as uniformity, corrosion resistance, lubricity and wear resistance are all reasons why the use of EN for automotive applications continues to grow. Historically, a cost sensitive market segment, auto makers have embraced the use low cost materials plated with a thin film of electroless nickel to meet strict requirements in an economical fashion. Fuel injection systems, aluminum fuel filters, brake pins and bleed valves are just a few applications that take full advantage of the depositâ€™s corrosion resistance. Differential pinion shafts and a variety of pins and washers are plated in large quantities due to the coatings lubricity, wear resistance and anti-galling properties (Figure 15). Brake pistons are plated in bright, medium phosphorus electroless nickel and heat treated to increase hardness and wear resistance. High deposit luster is desired and actually improves the surface finish of the piston resulting in reduced friction (Figure 16). Cast iron <b>slip</b> <b>yokes</b> are plated with EN to eliminate noise associated with galling.|$|R
50|$|The later P100's gearbox {{was simply}} a lower ratio version of the popular Ford T9 gearbox which was also fitted in some earlier Transits, unlike the car version of the Sierra the Type 9 was used up until {{production}} ceased - the cars had been updated in 1989 to the MT75 box. While this was a stronger box, it did not use a <b>slip</b> joint <b>yoke</b> so was unsuitable for use on the P100, as it had a live axle compared to the cars independent rear setups with non-moving diff units.|$|R
50|$|Through {{the end of}} the '70s {{substantially}} more CBOP (Cadillac/Buick/Oldsmobile/Pontiac) bellhousing THM400s were produced than any other THM400. Chevrolet bellhousing THM400s, while not rare, can be hard to find and are, as a result, usually more expensive to buy (they were commonly found in 3/4 ton (8500 GVW and above) Chevrolet/GMC trucks and vans (includes the P-series box vans and 1983-86 CUCVs) when RPO M40 was checked off the option list - especially when coupled to a 454 - usually in HD applications including the C40-C60 medium duty trucks where a bolt-on output shaft is used in place of a <b>slip</b> <b>yoke)</b> - when used with passenger cars it was usually coupled to a Mark IV engine or some high performance small blocks (e.g. the 1970 LT-1). The THM400 was never produced with a multicase bell housing.|$|E
