50|$|Centrifuge rotors have {{tremendous}} kinetic energy during high speed rotation. Rotor failure, caused by mechanical stress {{from the high}} forces imparted by the motor, can occur due to manufacturing defects, routine wear and tear, or improper use and maintenance. Such a failure can be catastrophic failure, especially with larger centrifuges, and generally results in total destruction of the centrifuge. While centrifuges generally have <b>safety</b> <b>shielding</b> to contain these failures, such shielding may be inadequate, especially in older models, or the entire centrifuge unit may be propelled from its position, resulting in damage to nearby personnel and equipment. Uncontained rotor failures have shattered laboratory windows and destroyed refrigerators and cabinetry.

40|$|New {{high power}} lasers with {{excellent}} beam parameter products like fibre and disk lasers offer not only new possibilities with material processing. Their use is also connected with high demands on laser safety. Conventional laser protection systems are passive systems made of massive shields or housings which resist the {{direct or indirect}} laser radiation for a specified time. The operator has to inspect the systems to ensure the functionality and safety. The risk of dangerous penetration or destruction by the laser beam increases enormously with smaller beam parameter products and higher laser power. Therefore it {{becomes more and more}} complicated and expensive to protect users and equipment against laser emission and to follow laser safety instructions, standards and regulations.

40|$|Reusable trocars {{have the}} {{advantage}} of being more costeffective than disposable trocars. However, the reusable trocar does lose its sharpness on insertion with repetitive insertion. Nonreusable trocars are expensive, but the sharpness of the knife facilitates insertion. Nonreusable trocars have a <b>safety</b> <b>shield</b> system designed to decrease abdominal organ injury, though the potential problem of bleeding from the abdominal wall port site has yet to be resolved. We therefore developed a novel ultrasonic vibrating trocar that does not lose its sharpness even with repetitive insertion. This trocar prevents bleeding by means of an ultrasonic cavitation effect. The ultrasonic vibrating trocar has the advantage of ease of insertion, and the force required for new reusable trocar insertion was only 34 % of the force required for insertion of commercially available nonreusable trocars. The force required for multiply used conventional reusable ultrasonic vibrating trocar insertion, ie, 900 insertions, was maintained at less than 46 % of the force required by the corresponding nonreusable trocars. Bleeding from the abdominal wall was prevented by an ultrasonic cavitation effect...|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} few years, efforts to develop new {{measurement}} systems to support nuclear nonproliferation and homeland security have increased substantially. Monte Carlo radiation transport {{is one of the}} simulation methods of choice for the analysis of data from existing systems and for the design of new measurement systems; it allows for accurate description of geometries, detailed modeling of particle-nucleus interactions, and event-by-event detection analysis. This paper describes the use of the Monte Carlo code MCNPX-PoliMi for nuclear nonproliferation applications, with particular emphasis on the simulation of spontaneous and neutron-induced nuclear fission. In fact, of all possible neutron-nucleus interactions, neutron-induced fission is the most defining characteristic of special nuclear material (such as U- 235 and Pu- 239), which is the material of interest in nuclear-nonproliferation applications. The MCNP-PoliMi code was originally released from the Radiation <b>Safety</b> <b>Shielding</b> Center (RSSIC) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 2003; the MCNPX-PoliMi code contains many enhancements and is based on MCNPX ver. 2. 7. 0.

40|$|This Alert {{described}} five {{cases in}} which persons were scalped when their hair became entangled around inadequately guarded rotating drivelines or shafts of farm equipment driven by power take offs. Four cases involved women who were baling hay. In the fifth case, a 12 year old girl was asked by her father to check the bale counter. All five of the incidents involved inadequately guarded drivelines and victims who were standing or walking near rotating drivelines. The drivelines involved were guarded by inverted U-shaped tunnel guards that did not completely enclose the drivelines. The drivelines were located about 4 feet above the ground, limiting visibility of the hazard. The drivelines concerned were associated with Models 54 A, 54 B, 58, and 62 of a bale thrower manufactured by New Holland prior to 1976.

40|$|Macroscopic growths at {{geographically}} separated acid mine drainages (AMDs) exhibit distinct populations. Yet, local heterogeneities {{are poorly}} understood. To gain novel mechanistic insights into this, we used OMICs tools to profile microbial populations coexisting {{in a single}} pyrite gallery AMD (pH ~ 2) in three distinct compartments: two from a stratified streamer (uppermost oxic and lowermost anoxic sediment-attached strata) and one from a submerged anoxic non-stratified mat biofilm. The communities colonising pyrite {{and those in the}} mature formations appear to be populated by the greatest diversity of bacteria and archaea (including â��ARMANâ�� (archaeal Richmond Mine acidophilic nano-organisms) -related), as compared with the known AMD, with ~ 44. 9 % unclassified sequences. We propose that the thick polymeric matrix may provide a <b>safety</b> <b>shield</b> against the prevailing extreme condition and also a massive carbon source, enabling non-typical acidophiles to develop more easily. Only 1 of 39 species were shared, suggesting a high metabolic heterogeneity in local microenvironments, defined by the O 2 concentration, spatial location and biofilm architecture. The suboxic mats, compositionally most similar to each other, are more diverse and active for S, CO 2, CH 4, fatty acid and lipopolysaccharide metabolism. The oxic stratum of the streamer, displaying a higher diversity of the so-called â��ARMANâ��-related Euryarchaeota, shows a higher expression level of proteins involved in signal transduction, cell growth and N, H 2, Fe, aromatic amino acids, sphingolipid and peptidoglycan metabolism. Our study is the first to highlight profound taxonomic and functional shifts in single AMD formations, as well as new microbial species and the importance of H 2 in acidic suboxic macroscopic growths...|$|E
40|$|Dianions {{of active}} {{hydrogen}} compounds having two negative charges capable of interacting (by resonance for example) {{with the same}} carbonyl or other activating group are {{of particular interest to}} organic chemists, since the anionic portion arising through the secondary ionization is much more nucleophilic than that from the primary ionization. Consequently, alkylation can be effected at the secondary site to the practical exclusion of the alkylation at the primary site. For example, the 1, 4 -dianion of acetophenone oxime undergoes C-alkylation with alkyl halides in 60 - 80 % yield. ^ Since diazotic acids can be considered to be derived from the oximes by substitution of nitrogen for the methine group, it was thought possible to form dianions of aliphatic diazotic acids by procedures similar to those used with oximes. This was the initial objective of this research. ^ The potassium diazotates of phenylmethane-, 1 -phenylethane-, and octane- 1 -diazotic acids were prepared in good yields by cleavage of the corresponding N-nitrosocarbamates with potassium t-butoxide. However, attempts to abstract the (alpha) -hydrogen from these diazotates with n-butyllithium were unsuccessful. Therefore, the lithium diazotates were prepared by the treatment of the N-nitrosocarbamates with lithium t-butoxide, a procedure that gave lower yields of the diazotates than treatment with t-butyl lithium but provided more tractable products. ^ CAUTION! Dried lithium diazotates must be used immediately and handled in the hood behind a <b>safety</b> <b>shield.</b> ^ When lithium phenylmethanediazotate in ether-HMPA solution was treated successively with n-butyllithium and methyl iodide at - 80 (DEGREES), three products were isolated: benzylidene n-butylmethylhydrazine, acetophenone n-butylmethylhydrazone, and acetophenone dimethylhydrazone. When lithium octane- 1 -diazotate was treated in the same fashion, the only identifiable product obtained was n-octylidene n-butylmethylhydrazine. The formation of these unexpected products can be explained by reasonable extrapolations of known chemistry of diazoalkanes and/or nitrosoamines. ...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAn experimental rotating wickless heat pipe apparatus {{was designed and}} machined. The apparatus includes a rotating heat pipe assembly, test stand, spray cooling assembly, <b>safety</b> <b>shielding,</b> and instrumentation. A revised condensing limit for {{the operation of the}} rotating heat pipe was obtained by modifying Ballbeck's Nusselt film condensation theory to include the effects of a thermal resistance in the condenser wall and in the condenser outside surface cooling mechanism. Approximate results, obtained for half-cone angles of 1, 2, and 3 degrees, show that less heat can be removed than originally predicted by Ballback, and that the outside heat transfer coefficient can significantly alter the condensing limit. An improved Nusselt theory was developed which applies for all half-cone angles, and which includes the effects of the thermal resistances in the condenser wall and in the condenser outside surface cooling mechanism. This formulation led to a second-order non-linear differential equation for the film thickness which was numerically integrated using a free-overfall boundary condition at the condenser exit. Results obtained for a half-cone angle of 0 degrees are substantially less than the results obtained from the approximate solution for half-cone degrees of 1, 2, and 3 degrees.
