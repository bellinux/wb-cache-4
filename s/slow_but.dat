5|$|Delaroche's {{attention}} to detail and literal precision in this painting evidences and demonstrates the <b>slow</b> <b>but</b> steady evolution of realism in art during the 19th century, and how its popularity began to rise.|$|E
5|$|For Braun the {{manuscript}} was fortuitous. Initially {{the sales of}} Max and Moritz were <b>slow,</b> <b>but</b> sales figures improved after the 1868 second edition. Overall there were 56 editions and more than 430,000 copies sold up to Busch's death in 1908. Despite at first being ignored by critics, teachers in the 1870s described Max and Moritz as frivolous and an undesirable influence on the moral development of young people.|$|E
5|$|In January 2012, Somali {{government}} forces and their AMISOM allies launched offensives on Al-Shabaab's last foothold {{on the northern}} outskirts of Mogadishu. The following month, Somali forces fighting alongside AMISOM seized Baidoa from the insurgent group. By June 2012, the allied forces had also captured El Bur, Afgooye, and Balad. Progress by the Kenya Army from the border towards Kismayo was <b>slow,</b> <b>but</b> Afmadow was also reported captured on 1 June 2012.|$|E

5|$|In March–April 1918, Battleship Division Nine escorted the Scandinavian Convoy {{two more}} times. Both {{missions}} were hampered by storms {{that made the}} going particularly <b>slow,</b> <b>but</b> were otherwise uneventful. Still, confidence in the wisdom of using battleships as an escort was fading at the Admiralty, and Admiral Beatty in particular was opposed to it. When the American ships returned to the new Grand Fleet base at Rosyth {{at the end of}} the second mission on 20 April, it was the last time they were used to escort the Scandinavian Convoy.|$|E
5|$|John, like Basil II before him, was a <b>slow</b> <b>but</b> steady campaigner. His armies made careful, {{measured}} gains over time, rarely exposing {{themselves to}} excessive risks, but nevertheless advancing inexorably towards their objectives. However, the Turks were resilient, {{and they did}} not allow themselves to be decisively defeated in any one engagement. They knew that it was difficult for the emperor to remain in one theatre of war for a long time, as events elsewhere often intervened that required his attention.|$|E
5|$|On 5 July 1943 the Wehrmacht {{launched}} its offensive. On the northern {{side of the}} salient, the German forces bogged down within four days. On the southern side, the German 4th Panzer Army, with Army Detachment Kempf on its eastern flank, attacked the Soviet defences of the Voronezh Front. They made <b>slow</b> <b>but</b> steady progress through the Soviet defensive lines.|$|E

5|$|Orders for the A318 {{have been}} {{relatively}} <b>slow,</b> <b>but</b> slightly better than for its direct competitor the Boeing 737–600. At 30 September 2017, Airbus had received 80 orders for this model compared to 69 for the 737-600. The sales pace has {{been influenced by the}} strong sales of the Bombardier CRJ900 and Embraer E-Jets series. The biggest A318 customers at 30 September 2017 were Governments, Executive and Private Jets (20), Air France (18), LATAM Airlines Group (15), GECAS (12) and Frontier Airlines (9).|$|E
5|$|Since the Victorian era the Thames {{has been}} {{extensively}} embanked, {{and many of its}} London tributaries now flow underground. The Thames is a tidal river, and London is vulnerable to flooding. The threat has increased over time because of a <b>slow</b> <b>but</b> continuous rise in high water level by the slow 'tilting' of Britain (up in the north and down in the south) caused by post-glacial rebound.|$|E
5|$|The Dark Knight is the highest-grossing film of 2008, the second-highest-grossing superhero film, the second-highest-grossing film {{based on}} comics, {{and the fourth}} highest-grossing North American film of all time. Adjusted for ticket-price {{inflation}} though, it ranks 28th. In contrast to Avatar and Titanic — both which grossed more than The Dark Knight in North America and had <b>slow</b> <b>but</b> steady earnings — The Dark Knight broke records in its opening weekend and slowed down significantly after its first few weekends.|$|E

5|$|The {{atmosphere}} {{is divided into}} a number of sections depending on altitude. The densest part of the atmosphere, the troposphere, begins at the surface and extends upwards to 65km. At the furnace-like surface the winds are <b>slow,</b> <b>but</b> {{at the top of the}} troposphere the temperature and pressure reaches Earth-like levels and clouds pick up speed to 100m/s.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, it {{received}} critical acclaim, won and {{was nominated for}} numerous awards, and has been recognized by many {{as one of the}} greatest games of all time. Sales of the title were initially <b>slow,</b> <b>but</b> it eventually became a commercial success. Its success prompted the development of a sequel, , which was released in November 2004. Further games set in the Sands of Time continuity have been developed, and it is generally cited as the reason for the Prince of Persia series' return to fame.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich's {{reputation}} suffered {{further damage}} when his imagery {{was adopted by}} a number of Hollywood directors, such as Walt Disney, built on the work of such German cinema masters as Fritz Lang and F. W. Murnau, within the horror and fantasy genres. His rehabilitation was <b>slow,</b> <b>but</b> enhanced through the writings of such critics and scholars as Werner Hofmann, Helmut Börsch-Supan and Sigrid Hinz, who successfully rejected and rebutted the political associations ascribed to his work, and placed it within a purely art-historical context. By the 1970s, he was again being exhibited in major galleries across the world, as he found favour with a new generation of critics and art historians.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, {{the city}} bought the two private systems. Some {{elevated}} lines ceased service immediately while others closed soon after. Integration was <b>slow,</b> <b>but</b> several connections were built between the IND and BMT; these now operate as one division called the B Division. Since the IRT tunnels, sharper curves, and stations {{are too small}} and therefore can not accommodate B Division cars, the IRT remains its own division, the A Division. However, many passenger transfers between stations of all three former companies have been created, allowing the entire network {{to be treated as}} a single unit.|$|E
5|$|Just as {{with other}} waves, moving into shallow water causes the tsunami to <b>slow</b> <b>but</b> grow in height. Either the trough or {{the crest of the}} tsunami can arrive at the coast first. In the former case, the sea draws back and leaves subtidal areas unusually exposed. When the crest arrives, it does not usually break but rushes inland, {{flooding}} all in its path. Much of the disaster's destruction can be produced by these flood waters, which drain back into the sea while pulling people and debris along. Several tsunamis can be caused by a single geological event. In such cases, it is common for the later waves to arrive between eight minutes and two hours after the first, which may not be the biggest or most destructive. Occasionally, in a shallow bay or estuary, a tsunami may transform into a bore.|$|E
5|$|On 23 July 1840, PedroII was {{declared}} {{of age and}} Joaquim Inácio was among the naval officers representing the armada in the delegation that greeted the young emperor. The rise of PedroII to head the central government resulted in a <b>slow,</b> <b>but</b> steady, restoration of order in the country. On 17 December, Joaquim Inácio was named inspetor do arsenal de marinha (inspector of the navy shipyard) in Rio Grande, {{the second most important}} town in Rio Grande do Sul. The province was still troubled by the Ragamuffin rebellion. He led the sailors manning the trenches surrounding Rio Grande and fought the Ragamuffins when they attacked the town in July 1841.|$|E

5|$|The final {{assault on}} Jerusalem began on 13 July; Raymond's troops {{attacked}} the south gate {{while the other}} contingents attacked the northern wall. Initially the Provençals at the southern gate made little headway, but the contingents at the northern wall fared better, with a <b>slow</b> <b>but</b> steady attrition of the defence. On 15 July, a final push was launched {{at both ends of}} the city, and eventually the inner rampart of the northern wall was captured. In the ensuing panic, the defenders abandoned the walls of the city at both ends, allowing the Crusaders to finally enter.|$|E
5|$|Twelve {{publishers}} {{rejected the}} manuscript before {{an editor at}} the Bobbs-Merrill Company risked his job to get it published. Contemporary reviewers' opinions were mixed. Some praised the novel as a powerful paean to individualism, while others thought it overlong and lacking sympathetic characters. Initial sales were <b>slow,</b> <b>but</b> the book gained a following by word of mouth and became a bestseller. More than 6.5million copies of The Fountainhead have been sold worldwide and it has been translated into more than 20 languages. The novel attracted a new following for Rand and has enjoyed a lasting influence, especially among architects and right-libertarians.|$|E
5|$|Utor's {{development}} {{following its}} naming was <b>slow,</b> <b>but</b> quickened as the tropical storm neared the Philippines. The tropical cyclone reached the southeastern coast of Samar by 06:00UTC on December9 and began tracking through the central Philippine archipelago {{over the next}} two days. Despite its interaction with the nearby islands, Utor continued to strengthen without much impediment and reached typhoon strength in the Visayan Sea at 12:00UTC that day. Twelve hours later, the typhoon attained an initial peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140km/h (85mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 955mbar (hPa; 28.20inHg) in the Sibuyan Sea according to the JMA. The JTWC analyzed an intensity of (185km/h) 115mph at that time. By 12:00UTC on December10, Utor had emerged into the South China Sea.|$|E
