That was not his position, and nobody could be less likely than he would himself have been to claim it. Pattison started no new problem. His name is associated with no fertile speculation, and with no work of the first degree of importance. Nor was he any more intended for a practical leader than for an intellectual discoverer. He did not belong to the class of authoritative men who are born to give decisions from the chair. Measured by any standard commensurate to his remarkable faculties, Pattison's life would be generally regarded as pale, negative, and ineffectual. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that he had a certain singular quality about him that made his society more interesting, more piquant, and more <b>sapid</b> than that of many men of a far wider importance and more commanding achievement.|$|E
6000|$|For instance, “while soluble crystalloids {{are always}} highly <b>sapid,</b> soluble colloids are {{singularly}} insipid,” {{as might be}} expected; for, as the sentient extremities of the nerves of the palate “are probably protected by a colloidal membrane,” impermeable to other colloids, a colloid, when tasted, probably never reaches those nerves. Again, “it has been observed that vegetable gum is not digested in the stomach; the coats of that organ dialyse the soluble food, absorbing crystalloids, and rejecting all colloids.” One of the mysterious processes accompanying digestion, the secretion of free muriatic acid by the coats of the stomach, obtains a probable hypothetical explanation through the same law. Finally, much light is thrown upon the observed phenomena of osmose (the passage of fluids outward and inward through animal membranes) {{by the fact that}} the membranes are colloidal. In consequence, the water and saline solutions contained in the animal body pass easily and rapidly through the membranes, while the substances directly applicable to nutrition, which are mostly colloidal, are detained by them.(154) ...|$|E
6000|$|THE {{promoter}} of organized charity protests against [...] "the wasteful and mischievous method of undirected relief." [...] He means, naturally, relief {{that is not}} directed by somebody else than the person giving it--undirected by him and his kind--professional almoners--philanthropists who deem it more blessed to allot than to bestow. Indubitably much is wasted and some mischief done by indiscriminate giving--and individual givers are addicted to that faulty practice. But {{there is something to}} be said for [...] "undirected relief" [...] quite the same. It blesses not only him who receives (when he is worthy; and when he is not upon his own head be it), but him who gives. To those uncalculating persons who, despite the protests of the organized charitable, concede a certain moral value to the spontaneous impulses of the heart and read in the word [...] "relief" [...] a double meaning, the office of the mere distributor is imperfectly sacred. He is even without scriptural authority, and lives in the perpetual challenge of a moral quo warranto. Nevertheless he is not without his uses. He is a tapper of tills that do not open automatically. He is almoner to the uncompassionate, who but for him would give no alms. He negotiates unnatural but not censurable relations between selfishness and ingratitude. The good that he does is purely material. He makes two leaves of fat to grow where but one grew before, lessens the sum of gastric pangs and dorsal chills. All this is something, certainly, but it generates no warm and elevated sentiments and does nothing in mitigation of the poor's animosity to the rich. Organized charity is a <b>sapid</b> and savorless thing; its place among moral agencies is no higher than that of root beer.|$|E
60|$|It {{is certain}} that by {{whatever}} other deficiencies it may be marked The Ring and the Book is blameless for the most characteristic of all the shortcomings of contemporary verse, a grievous sterility of thought. And why? Because sterility of thought is the blight struck into the minds of men by timorous and halt-footed scepticism, by a half-hearted dread of what chill thing the truth might prove itself, by unmanly reluctance or moral incapacity to carry the faculty of poetic vision over the whole field; and because Mr. Browning's intelligence, on the other hand, is masculine and courageous, moving cheerfully on the solid earth of an articulate and defined conviction, and careful not to omit realities from the conception of the great drama, merely for being unsightly to the too fastidious eye, or jarring in the ear, or too bitterly perplexing to faith or understanding. It is this resolute feeling after and grip of fact {{which is at the}} root of his distinguishing fruitfulness of thought, and it is exuberance of thought, spontaneous, well-marked, and <b>sapid,</b> that keeps him out of poetical preaching, on the one hand, and mere making of music, on the other. Regret as we may the fantastic rudeness and unscrupulous barbarisms into which Mr. Browning's art too often falls, and find what fault we may with his method, let us ever remember how much he has to say, and how effectively he communicates the shock of new thought which was first imparted to him by the vivid conception of a large and far-reaching story. The value of the thought, indeed, is not to be measured by poetic tests; but still the thought has poetic value, too, for it is this which has stirred in the writer that keen yet impersonal interest in the actors of his story and in its situations which is one of the most certain notes of true dramatic feeling, and which therefore gives the most unfailing stimulus to the interest of the appreciative reader.|$|E
6000|$|Catherine {{was more}} serious and {{intelligent}} than this in her pursuit of French culture. She had begun with {{the books in}} {{which most of the}} salt of old France was to be found, with Rabelais, Scarron, Montaigne; she cherished Molière and Corneille; and of the writers of the eighteenth century, apart from Voltaire, the author of Gil Blas was her favourite. Such a list tells its own tale of a mind turned to what is masculine, racy, pungent, and thoroughly <b>sapid.</b> [...] "I am a Gauloise of the north," [...] she said, [...] "I only understand the old French; I do not understand the new. I made up my mind to get something out of your gentry, the learned men in ist: I have tried them; I made some of them come here; I occasionally wrote to them; they wearied me to death, and never understood me; there was only my good protector, Voltaire. Do you know it was Voltaire who made me the fashion?"[75] This was a confidential revelation, made long after most of the philosophers were dead. We might have penetrated the secret of her friendship for such a man as Diderot, even with less direct evidence than this. It was the vogue of the philosophers, and not their philosophy that made Catherine their friend. They were the great interest of Europe at this time, just as Greek scholars had been its interest in one century, painters in another, great masters of religious controversy in a third. [...] "What makes the great merit of France," [...] said Voltaire, [...] "what makes its unique superiority, is a small number of sublime or delightful men of genius, who cause French to be spoken at Vienna, at Stockholm, and at Moscow. Your ministers, your intendants, your chief secretaries have no part in all this glory." [...] This vogue of the philosophers brought the whole literature of their country into universal repute. In the depths of the Crimea a khan of the Tartars took a delight in having Tartufe and the Bourgeois Gentilhomme read aloud to him.[76] ...|$|E
6000|$|Perhaps {{some will}} read this reply with impatience; being able, as they think, to cite facts totally at {{variance}} with it. It may appear absurd if we deny the relevancy of these facts. And yet the paradox is quite defensible. The truth is, that the instances of excess which such persons have in mind, are usually {{the consequences of the}} restrictive system they seem to justify. They are the sensual reactions caused by an ascetic regimen. They illustrate on a small scale that commonly-remarked truth, that those who during youth have been subject to the most rigorous discipline, are apt afterwards to rush into the wildest extravagances. They are analogous to those frightful phenomena, once not uncommon in convents, where nuns suddenly lapsed from the extremest austerities into an almost demoniac wickedness. They simply exhibit the uncontrollable vehemence of long-denied desires. Consider the ordinary tastes and the ordinary treatment of children. The love of sweets is conspicuous and almost universal among them. Probably ninety-nine people in a hundred presume that there is nothing more in this than gratification of the palate; and that, in common with other sensual desires, it should be discouraged. The physiologist, however, whose discoveries lead him to an ever-increasing reverence for the arrangements of things, suspects something more in this love of sweets than is currently supposed; and inquiry confirms the suspicion. He finds that sugar plays an important part in the vital processes. Both saccharine and fatty matters are eventually oxidised in the body; and there is an accompanying evolution of heat. Sugar is the form to which sundry other compounds have to be reduced before they are available as heat-making food; and this formation of sugar is carried on in the body. Not only is starch changed into sugar in the course of digestion, but it has been proved by M. Claude Bernard that the liver is a factory in which other constituents of food are transformed into sugar: the need for sugar being so imperative that it is even thus produced from nitrogenous substances when no others are given. Now, when to the fact that children have a marked desire for this valuable heat-food, we join {{the fact that they have}} usually a marked dislike to that food which gives out the greatest amount of heat during oxidation (namely, fat), we have reason for thinking that excess of the one compensates for defect of the other--that the organism demands more sugar because it cannot deal with much fat. Again, children are fond of vegetable acids. Fruits of all kinds are their delight; and, in the absence of anything better, they will devour unripe gooseberries and the sourest of crabs. Now not only are vegetable acids, in common with mineral ones, very good tonics, and beneficial as such when taken in moderation; but they have, when administered in their natural forms, other advantages. [...] "Ripe fruit," [...] says Dr. Andrew Combe, [...] "is more freely given on the Continent than in this country; and, particularly when the bowels act imperfectly, it is often very useful." [...] See, then, the discord between the instinctive wants of children and their habitual treatment. Here are two dominant desires, which in all probability express certain needs of the child's constitution; and not only are they ignored in the nursery-regimen, but there is a general tendency to forbid the gratification of them. Bread-and-milk in the morning, tea and bread-and-butter at night, or some dietary equally insipid, is rigidly adhered to; and any ministration to the palate is thought needless, or rather, wrong. What is the consequence? When, on fête-days, there is unlimited access to good things--when a gift of pocket-money brings the contents of the confectioner's window within reach, or when by some accident the free run of a fruit-garden is obtained; then the long-denied, and therefore intense, desires lead to great excesses. There is an impromptu carnival, due partly to release from past restraints, and partly to the consciousness that a long Lent will begin on the morrow. And then, when the evils of repletion display themselves, it is argued that children must not be left to the guidance of their appetites! These disastrous results of artificial restrictions, are themselves cited as proving the need for further restrictions! We contend, therefore, that the reasoning used to justify this system of interference is vicious. We contend that, were children allowed daily to partake of these more <b>sapid</b> edibles, for which there is a physiological requirement, they would rarely exceed, as they now mostly do when they have the opportunity: were fruit, as Dr. Combe recommends, [...] "to constitute a part of the regular food" [...] (given, as he advises, not between meals, but along with them), there would be none of that craving which prompts the devouring of crabs and sloes. And similarly in other cases.|$|E

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the presence of the selective taste regions on the tongue and also the palate participation in the oral taste definition. METHODS: A standard tongue divided in six regions was exposed with the four basic tastes (sweet, salted, sour and bitter), 10 times each. Thirteen volunteers were studied from both side and 34 only from one side, performing 240 tests with opened mouth and 240 with closing mouth, just after tongue <b>sapid</b> stimulation. A second group, with 12 volunteers, had its taste recognition studied, with and without palate isolation, using silicone prosthesis (n = 120). RESULTS: From results, chi-square (3 × 2) and (2 × 2), nonparametric independency test with P = 0. 05 were obtained. CONCLUSIONS: Anterior, medium and posterior regions of the tongue, at both sides, had the same taste discriminative capacity.

40|$|SUMMARY Changes in taste acuity {{accompany}} various disease {{processes and}} {{are useful in}} diagnosis. Lingual lesions may decrease acuity for salt and sweet, maxillary dentures de-crease acuity for sour and bitter. Patients with gonadal dysgenesis and pseudohypoparathyroidism also exhibit decreased acuity for sour and bitter. Patients with type I familial dysautonomia (Riley-Day syndrome) and many patients treated with D-penicillamine exhibit decreased acuity for each quality, whereas those with untreated adrenal cor-tical insufficiency exhibit increased detection acuity for each quality. These abnormalities have pro-vided clues for physiological definition of taste localization in man and for reevaluation {{of the role of}} taste buds. From these data the taste process was separated into two sets of events, preneural and neural. Mechanisms controlling the preneural or initial events are assumed to regulate the flux of <b>sapid</b> substances (tastants) across the taste bud membrane by changes in the conformation of an hypothesized protein (gatekeeper protein) that lines the holes of the taste bud pore membrane. This control is partly exerted by an equilibrium between thiols and metal ions. Shifting this equi-librium alters the conformation of the gatekeeper protein causing it to open or close, thereby alter-ing taste acuity by altering tastant flux. D R. ROBERT I. HENKIN: This conference describes the mechanisms of the taste processes from three different levels of bio-logical organization: [1] physiological, [2] anatomical, and [3] macromolecular. These descriptions will be synthesized into a the-ory that defines the initial events of the taste process which take place from the time of entry of <b>sapid</b> substances into the oral cavity until just before the depolariza-tion of the taste nerves...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a design for agile manufacturing workcells intended for light mechanical assembly of products made from similar components (i. e., parts families). We define agile manufacturing {{as the ability}} to accomplish rapid changeover from the assembly of one product to the assembly of a different product. <b>sapid</b> hardware changeover is made possible through the use of robots, flexible part feeders, modular grippers, and modular assembly hardware. The division of assembly, feeding, and unloading tasks between multiple robots is examined with prioritization based upon assembly time. Rapid software changeover will be facilitated by the use of a real-time, object-oriented software environment utilizing graphical simulations for off-line software development. An innovative dual VMEbus controller architecture permits an open software environment while accommodating the closed nature of most commercial robot controllers. These agile features permit new products to be introduced with minimal downtime and system reconfiguration...|$|E
40|$|The Otsuka Long Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats {{lack the}} CCK- 1 receptor, are hyperphagic, {{progressively}} become obese, and develop type- 2 diabetes. We recently demonstrated an increased preference for both real and sham feeding of sucrose in this strain suggesting altered orosensory sensitivity. To investigate taste functions, we used an automated gustometer with 10 -sec access to different concentrations of various <b>sapid</b> stimuli. Tests were repeated at 10 and 18 weeks of age {{to assess the}} early and advanced stages of pre-diabetes, respectively. Compared with age-matched, non-mutant controls, the OLETF rats showed higher avidity for sucrose at both ages. This difference increased {{as a function of}} age and tastant concentration. An exaggerated response also occurred for saccharin, alanine, and fructose, but not for Polycose. Similarly, OLETF rats consumed monosodium-glutamate more at the lower concentrations compared with controls, an effect that age also accentuated. In contrast, there was no statistical strain or age differences in responses to NaCl, MgCl 2, citric acid, quinine-HCl and the trigeminal stimulus, capsaicin. These findings demonstrate that compared to controls, OLETF rats differ in their gustatory functions with an overall augmented sensitivity for swee...|$|E
40|$|Glutathione transferases (GSTs) are {{ubiquitous}} key detoxification {{enzymes that}} catalyze the conjugation of glutathione {{to a large}} variety of xenobiotic chemical including odorants and <b>sapid</b> molecules. A previous study in Drosophila melanogaster demonstrated {{the existence of a}} GST specifically expressed in the antenna and involved in signal termination by catalyzing biotransformation of odorant molecules. Genomic analysis allows identifying forty GSTs in Drosophila melanogaster but their biochemistry is poorly documented. Here we demonstrated that among the GSTs, dmelGSTD 2 - 2 was strongly and preferentially overexpressed in the sensory organs (antennae, proboscis, legs, wings) after an exposure to bitter molecules supplemented in food. In regard to these aspects we shed light on the existence of a gustatory GST. We expressed, purified and performed enzymatic characterization revealing that dmelGSTD 2 - 2 is able to interact and biotransform bitter compounds (such as caffeine or isothiocyanates). Moreover, we solved the crystal structure of this dmelGST D 2 - 2 which is the first of this enzyme class and also one of the first in insect. DmelGSTD 2 - 2 was solved at 1. 5 Å resolution and appears as a dimer. The biochemical function in Drosophila melanogaster of this enzyme toward bitter compounds is discussed {{in the light of the}} in vivo study supplemented by in silico binding analysis and enzymatic assay with a panel of bitter molecules...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the variability of TD in children undergoing HSCT. Cases were identified as consecutively enrolled children in the period January 2011 -January 2013 among patients attending the Paediatric Department of Spedali Civili of Brescia and all candidates to HSCT. The TST was conducted in two phases: identification of threshold values and identification of perceived stimulus intensity. Sixteen <b>sapid</b> solutions with four flavors (sucrose, sodium chloride, citric acid, and quinine hydrochloride) at four different concentrations were administered in a random sequence. The same protocol was administered at different time intervals: before starting the conditioning therapy (T 0), during the conditioning therapy (T 1) (two times), and every three months (two times) after engraftment post-HSCT (T 2). A p-value < 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Fifty-one children (29 female and 22 male, mean age 5. 2 ± 0. 7 yr) were enrolled. Threshold value means for the four flavors increased during HSCT conditioning therapy (T 1) (p < 0. 01); intensity of perceived stimulus decreased during HSCT conditioning therapy (p < 0. 01). At six months after engraftment (T 2), both parameters had returned to starting values (T 0). Changes in taste perception in children undergoing HSCT seem to occur especially during the conditioning therapy and resolve in about six months after engraftment post-HSCT...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Integrated taste {{responses}} to chemical stimulation ofthe tongue were recorded from the intact chorda tympani nerve in four species of gerbils (Meriones libycus, M. shawl, M. unguiculatus and Psam~nomys obesus). 1. Sucrose {{was one of}} the most effective stimulants. 2. In comparison with sucrose, NaCl was less effective in gerbils than in other rodents. The smallest NaC 1 responses were found in those gerbil species whose native habitat and food subject hem to the greatest osmotic stress. 3. The non-linearity of the NaC 1 concentration-response data suggested there may be more than one type of NaC 1 receptor site. 4. Two groups of cations were recognized as stimulants in Meriones pecies: (Na+, Li+) and (K +, Rb +, Cs+). 5. The stimulating effectiveness ofmethyl ~- and fl-D-glucopyranoside was compared with several naturally occuring sugars. From this analysis, it was concluded that the stimulating potency of glucopyranoside is increased by an alpha linked substituent, asin sucrose. 6. The only reliable neural {{responses to}} water rinse occured with the divalent cations in the two species not found in extreme desert. It is improbable that gustatory water esponses play a role in the water balance of desert rodents. 7. Sunflower seeds contain 4. 28 % sucrose which is the dominant <b>sapid</b> substance. Lipid soluble chemicals did not stimulate the taste receptors. 8. Some aspects of the evolution of gustatory systems are discussed...|$|E
40|$|For {{humans and}} rodents, ingesting sucrose is rewarding. This {{experiment}} tested the prediction that the neural activity produced by <b>sapid</b> sucrose reaches reward systems via projections from the pons through the limbic system. Gastric cannulas drained ingested fluid before absorption. For 10 days, the rats alternated {{an hour of}} this sham ingestion between sucrose and water. On the final test day, half of them sham drank water {{and the other half}} 0. 6 M sucrose. Thirty minutes later, the rats were killed and their brains immunohistochemically stained for Fos. The groups consisted of controls and rats with excitotoxic lesions in the gustatory thalamus (TTA), the medial (gustatory) parabrachial nucleus (PBN), or the lateral (visceral afferent) parabrachial nucleus. In controls, compared with water, sham ingesting sucrose produced significantly more Fos-positive neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract, PBN, TTA, and gustatory cortex (GC). In the ventral forebrain, sucrose sham licking increased Fos in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, central nucleus of amygdala, and the shell of nucleus accumbens. Thalamic lesions blocked the sucrose effect in GC but not in the ventral forebrain. After lateral PBN lesions, the Fos distributions produced by distilled H 2 O or sucrose intake did not differ from controls. Bilateral medial PBN damage, however, eliminated the sucrose-induced Fos increase not only in the TTA and GC but also in the ventral forebrain. Thus ventral forebrain areas associated with affective responses appear to be activated directly by PBN gustatory neurons rather than via the thalamocortical taste system...|$|E
40|$|The lateral {{organization}} of the gustatory pathway in man is incompletely understood. Majority of the studies support an uncrossed projection from {{each side of the}} tongue to the cortex, but reports of an opposite crossed organization continue to appear in the neurological literature. We studied the lateral {{organization of}} the gustatory pathway in normal controls, a man with a complete callosal agenesis, and a man with a complete section of the corpus callosum, a right anterior-frontal lesion, and language in the left hemisphere. <b>Sapid</b> solutions were applied to one or {{the other side of the}} tongue, and subjects reported the taste of the stimulus either verbally or by manually pointing to the name of the taste. There were no differences in accuracy and reaction time between the right and left hemitongues of the controls and the genetically acallosal observer, By contrast, the callosotomy subject showed a constant marked advantage of the left hemitongue over the right for both accuracy and speed of response, though performance with right stimuli was clearly above chance. The left advantage can be attributed to the left hemisphere being favored by the essentially verbal nature of the task, or to the presence of a lesion in cortical gustatory areas in the right hemisphere, or to both factors. Whichever of these hypotheses turns out to be correct, the results unequivocally reject the notion of an exclusively crossed {{organization of the}} gustatory pathway from the tongue to the cortex, and favor the notion of a bilaterally distributed organization of this pathway with a marked predominance of the uncrossed over the crossed component...|$|E
