40|$|The recent {{definitive}} deuterium {{solid state}} NMR spectroscopic evidence for <b>structural</b> <b>water</b> in fluor- and hydroxylapatites has prompted our {{study of the}} conditions necessary for the removal and reincorporation of this important structural feature of apatites. Thermal gravimetric analysis of 20 synthetic carbonated calcium hydroxylapatite (CCaApOH) samples and nine carbonated calcium fluorapatite (CCaApF) samples {{has been used to}} determine the amount of structural and adsorbed water in each sample. No correlation between the weight percent and number of moles of <b>structural</b> <b>water</b> and the weight percent carbonate in CCaApOH and CCaApF has been found. In contrast, {{there appears to be a}} relationship between the amount of adsorbed water and the carbonate concentration in the fluorapatites prepared with a two hour digestion time, as well as in the hydroxylapatites prepared with one hour digestion periods, presumably due to the effect of carbonate on crystallite size. <b>Structural</b> <b>water</b> can be removed from the apatite lattice, primarily above 200 °C, but heating to over 550 °C is required for complete removal.

These yield qualitative estimates of shock-induced water loss and demonstrate that a portion of the shock released <b>structural</b> <b>water</b> is readsorbed on interfacial grain surfaces. Determination of the post-shock water content of the shocked samples relates shock-induced water loss and shock pressure.

40|$|Activation and {{deactivation}} {{behavior of}} heteropoly acids as catalyst precursors O. Timpe, H. Noack, und G. Mestl§ Fitz-Haber-Institut der Max-Planck-Gesellschaft, Faradayweg 4 - 6, 14195 Berlin Heteropoly acids (HPA) are important catalysts for selective partial oxidations {{due to their}} acid and redox active properties. Thee Keggin-type phosphorus molybdo acid H 4 [PMo 12 O 40] {{is the basis for}} an industrially used catalyst in the methacrylic acid synthesis which contains vanadium too. The protons of the free HPA are partially exchanged by Cs+ ions. The insufficient stability of this class of substances does not allow their optimum use as catalysts. A continuous degradation of their catalytic properties and thus of the possible yields is observed under stationary reaction conditions. Due to their characteristic instability, it is unlikely that intact HPA´s are the active catalysts, although frequently stated in the literature. This correlates {{with the fact that the}} HPA has to be activated in the industrial application prior to the actual catalysis. The structural and chemical properties of the precursor-HPA are well characterized, correlate however only indirectly with the catalytic data. The oxides of the constituting transition metals are the final state of the HPA-decomposition, whose stoichiometry or degree of oxidation is determined by the surrounding atmosphere. The reaction pathway to these final decomposition products can be understood as a condensation process followed by complete structural reorganization. The loss of water occurs in two steps. The irreversible loss of <b>structural</b> <b>water</b> at elevated temperatures follows after the reversible loss of crystal water at temperatures below 400 K. Oxygen defects are introduced into the Keggin anions with the loss of <b>structural</b> <b>water.</b> These defects are presumably the reason for the low reaction barriers of the subsequent structural reorganization of the defective Keggin anions. It could be shown by comparing thermogravimetric measurements of different molybdenum HPA, containing P as well as Si as the hetero atom, in different atmospheres that the reduction of the HPA occurs only after the loss of <b>structural</b> <b>water.</b> This reduction is the consequence of the loss of <b>structural</b> <b>water</b> because these HPA systems do not have a stability plateau after this step of water removal. Under oxidative conditions, the formation of MoO 3 is observed after this step of loss of water. The comparison of HPA´s reveals a continuous mass loss of the P-containing samples after the loss of <b>structural</b> <b>water</b> under isothermal conditions in hydrogen atmosphere, which is qualitatively identified as the loss of P in form of reduced P-compounds, e. g. PH 3. Directly after this mass loss, the TG curves show a step which is attributed to the reduction of the transition metal ions. The incorporation of V into the Keggin leads to an enhanced destabilizing effect in case of Si-HPA as compared to P-HPA. Investigations of the catalytic activity (TPRS) can be correlated with the TG data. After the loss of <b>structural</b> <b>water,</b> all investigated HPA are active for the partial oxidation reactions. This catalytic activity decreases with time on stream. Under catalytic conditions, the active fragments are not stable which were formed from the Keggin anions after loss of <b>structural</b> <b>water.</b> Total oxidation increases with the reactor temperature. In case of the Si-HPA, the total oxidation is the major reaction path already after the loss of <b>structural</b> <b>water.</b> It can be concluded from a comparison of the catalytic activities and selectivities of the different HPA that P stabilizes the fragments of the decomposed Keggins, which are characterized by a high degree of partial oxidation, in contrary to Si containing catalysts. Olefins react already at room temperature with the crystal water of the acidic HPA under water addition to alcohols. In this way the loss of water of the HPA samples is considerably increased and occurs already at room temperature. In contrast, HPA are not reduced by hydrogen at room temperature. The loss of <b>structural</b> <b>water</b> is shifted to lower temperatures in a similar way in presence of olefins. HPA preparations in which all protons of the HPA were exchanged by Cs+ ions exhibited an considerably enhanced stability toward reduction. These salts cannot desorb <b>structural</b> <b>water.</b> The decomposition and condensation of the Keggin anion fragments therefore is suppressed. Hence, these Cs salts are catalytically inactive for the partial oxidation. In contrast, more unstable tetraalkyl ammionum salts are catalytically active already at much lower temperatures which correlate with the redox potentials of the cations. It can be concluded that structural intact Keggin anions are catalytically inactive and have to be considered as the precursors of the actual active compounds...|$|E

In the nanostructure of C-S-H, <b>structural</b> <b>water</b> molecules are distributed in the interlayer region and determine the mechanical performance of C-S-H gel. In this study, C-S-H gels with different water contents expressed as the water/Ca ratio are characterized in the light of molecular dynamics. In order to study the influence of the water molecules, the structures of 12 C-S-H gel samples with water/Ca ratios from 0 to 0. 95 are investigated. It is found that the penetration of water molecules transforms the C-S-H gel from an amorphous to a layered structure by silicate depolymerization as the water content gradually increases. The structures are then tested for mechanical properties by simulated uniaxial tension and compression. The mechanical tests associated with structural analysis reveal that the <b>structural</b> <b>water</b> molecules can greatly weaken the stiffness and the cohesive force by replacing the ionic covalent bond with unstable H-bond connections. By studying the tensile failure mechanism of C-S-H gels at different humidity levels, the disconnecting role of the <b>structural</b> <b>water</b> molecules is comprehensively interpreted. Because the interlayer water molecules prevent reconstruction of the bonds between the Ca-w and the silicate chains, the plasticity of the C-S-H gels is reduced significantly in the change from a dry state to a saturated state. In addition, the compressive strength of a C-S-H gel in the saturated state is much larger than the tensile strength. This provides molecular evidence for the tensile weakness of cement paste.
