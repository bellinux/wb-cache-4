40|$|This paper {{presents}} a participatory approach to conceptualizing system's models and to identifying critical issues in complex <b>socio-environmental</b> <b>systems,</b> combining information collected from individual experts and stakeholders. A method was developed to: (i) capture individuals mental {{models in the}} form of causal loop diagrams, using interaction matrices; (ii) build a conceptual model of the system combining the contribution of all stakeholders; (iii) identify critical issues for the system and (iv) prepare a combined causal loop diagram for further discussion and system dynamics simulations. This method was used to engage a group of stakeholders involved in the preparation of a plan for integrated coastal zone management in Egypt. The experience helped highlight the critical issues of the system in terms of importance given by the actors involved in the exercise and their impact on the coastal system. This approach also demonstrated the utility of conceptualizing complex <b>socio-environmental</b> <b>systems</b> for identifying critical issues in data-poor environments.

Hence, vulnerability has both social and ecological components (Stone-Jovicich 2015) and can be defined as the inability of a (<b>socio-environmental)</b> <b>system</b> to adequately cope or rebound after a disturbance (Wisner et al. 2004). Drought, in particular, represents a slow-onset and often understudied type of disaster occurrence (Cutter 2004).

40|$|To {{build an}} {{agent-based}} computational {{model of a}} specific <b>socio-environmental</b> <b>system</b> requires that answers be found to several important questions including: what social actors and contextual entities are to be modelled as software agents? With what mental functions must these software agents be equipped? What standard design or designs {{should be used to}} create the software agents? This paper concentrates upon the last of these questions. The currently available range of agent designs is considered, along with their limitations and inter-relationships. How best to choose a design to meet the requirements of a particular modelling task is discussed and illustrated by reference to the task of designing an informative agent-based model of a segmented, polycentric and integrated network (“SPIN”) organisation of the type analysed by Gerlach in the context of environmental activism...|$|R
40|$|A {{mechanical}} system is entirely {{described by the}} single mathematical model coupling the system's design with mechanical laws; given the system's initial state and the control strategy, the model predicts its future trajectory precisely. Looking at a complex <b>socio-environmental</b> <b>system,</b> {{we find ourselves in}} a different situation. The laws driving the system are poorly understood, and the system is subject to uncertain inputs. Any particular model captures the system only partially, and, hence, the use of a single model can be misleading. We suggest using a multi-model approach aiming at integrating knowledge given by several models showing the system from different angles. In this presentation two possible approaches to integration of models are discussed. The first one shows how to integrate alternative random variables describing the same observed quantity based on assessment of the joint probability distribution conditioned to the posterior event. The second approach allows for generating a synthetic trajectory from two alternative model-based trajectories approximating the actual past dynamics in an appropriate metrics...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{attention}} to regime shifts, critical transitions, non-marginal changes, and systemic shocks {{calls for the}} development of models that are able to reproduce or grow structural changes that occur over time periods perceived as abrupt. This paper highlights specific modelling challenges to consider when exploring coupled <b>socio-environmental</b> <b>systems</b> experiencing regime shifts. We explore these challenges in the context of four modelling approaches that have been applied to the study of regime shifts in coupled socio-environmental systems: statistical, system dynamics, equilibrium and agent-based modelling. When reviewing these modelling approaches we reflect on a set of criteria including the ability of an approach (1) to capture feedbacks between social and environmental system, (2) to represent the sources of regime shifts, (3) to incorporate complexity aspects, and (4) to deal with regime shift identification. Many of the modelling examples considered do not provide information on all these criteria, which receive a lot of attention in empirical studies of registered regime shifts. This suggests a need to develop a common modelling terminology in the domain of modelling for resilience and regime shifts. When discussing strengths and weaknesses of various modelling paradigms we conclude that a hybrid approach is likely to provide most insights into the processes and consequences of regime shifts. Challenges and frontier directions of research for designing models to study regime shifts in coupled <b>socio-environmental</b> <b>systems</b> are outlined...|$|E

We gathered data at several ski fields using a mixed methodology including: geomorphic assessment, qualitative interviews, and an adaptation of Ozesmi and Ozesmi’s (2003) multi-step fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM) approach. The data gathered from FCM are qualitatively condensed, and aggregated to three different participant social groups. The social groups include ski fields users, ski industry workers, and ski field managers. Both quantitative and qualitative indices are used to analyze social cognitive maps to identify critical nodes for ANN simulations. The simulations experiment with auto-associative neural networks for developing adaptive preparation, response and recovery strategies. Moreover, simulations attempt to identify key priorities for preparation, response, and recovery for improving resilience to earthquakes in these complex and dynamic environments. The novel mixed methodology {{is presented as a}} means of linking physical and social sciences in high complexity, high uncertainty <b>socio-environmental</b> <b>systems.</b> Simulation results indicate that participants perceived that increases in Social Preparation Action, Social Preparation Resources, Social Response Action and Social Response Resources have a positive benefit in improving the resilience to earthquakes of ski fields’ stakeholders...|$|E
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{two major}} challenges for an integrated analysis of <b>socio-environmental</b> <b>systems,</b> namely {{the diversity of}} contributing disciplines and the wide spectrum of temporal and spatial scales. Archaeology, the geosciences and socio-cultural anthropology provide information relating to a diversity of specific time series and spatial distribution maps in order to answer questions relating {{to the impact of}} environmental and anthropogenic factors in population growth and migration processes. A model based on the key idea of adaptive cycles as it was initially developed in resilience research can be productively employed to bridge the diversity of disciplines and to integrate the diversity of data that they provide. This article outlines first steps towards recognizing similar patterns across a wide spectrum of empirical observations. It is exploratory in its attempt to trace these patterns across different layers of understanding the complexity of human–environment interaction. The case material considered relates to (1) observable ethnographic data on forager mobility and its simulation, (2) the demography of the Central European Neolithic, (3) the palaeodemography of foragers during the Late Upper Palaeolithic, (4) the societal reorganization by Palaeolithic foragers under climate instability, (5) the palaeoenvironmental study of lake Prespa in the Balkans, and (6) environmental responses to agricultural land use practices in relation to sediment flux in hillslope systems. With reference to these cases, an adaptive cycle model is outlined, with phases of growth, conservation, distortion and reorganization. The model helps to infer internal dynamics in the diverse environmental and social domains without reducing one domain to another while still connecting evidence from a host of different sources. More generally, such a model could help in understanding features of non-linearity, multifactoral relations, scale dependency and time-lags which seem to be typical for the complex dynamics of integrated <b>socio-environmental</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|E
40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Environmental {{issues are}} complex and {{understanding}} them involves integration of different areas of knowledge, feedback and time delays, however strategies to cope with complexity are not often used or taught in environmental education. The aim of this thesis {{is to examine the}} benefit of three such strategies for environmental education: multiple external representations, learning from models, and collaborative learning. The <b>socio-environmental</b> <b>system</b> modelled was visitor impact in a national park in Australia. Students in Year 9 and 10 from two schools were given a text description (Text group) and either a system dynamics model (SDM group), an agent-based model (ABM group), or both models (SDM & ABM group). This experimental design allowed learning outcomes (environmental and system dynamics knowledge, and understanding of the <b>socio-environmental</b> <b>system)</b> and use of the model(s) (in terms of the proportion of time spent on each screen, activities, and strategies) to be compared in each learning environment (individual and collaborative). Multiple external representations were the most successful strategy in the individual learning environment in terms of increases in environmental knowledge. However, students given only the system dynamics model had greater understanding of the system, and students given only the agent-based model increased environmental knowledge easily identified in the animated representation. Prior knowledge, patterns of use, strategies for changing variables and the representational affordances of the models explained some of these differences. In particular, prior knowledge was an important indicator of how students coordinated use of the models in the SDM & ABM group. Learning with a system dynamics model was the most successful strategy for students in the collaborative learning environment. Differences between the learning environments were detected in all groups with respect to both learning outcomes and use of the models due to prior knowledge, interrogation of the models, and the learning environments themselves. These experiments have provided evidence that strategies for understanding complex systems provide viable methods of communicating complex ideas to school-aged students with varying levels of prior knowledge. In particular, multiple external representations provided students with flexibility in how they learned; models allowed students to experiment with a system otherwise not allowed; and a collaborative learning environment facilitated students’ interpretation of a system dynamics model...|$|R

Using a combination of the interrupted case and directed case methods, students are presented with an issue that arose during the implementation of Green Revolution agricultural policies in Bali: rice farmers were required to plant new high yield rice varieties continuously rather than following the coordinated cropping schedules set up by water temple priests. Students examine qualitative and quantitative data from classic anthropological research by Dr. Steven Lansing to learn about the important role that water temples play in achieving sustainable rice cultivation in Bali. Using a model that synthesizes ecological, hydrological, and ethnographic data, Lansing and his colleague, Dr. James Kremer, were able to demonstrate that temple priests determine the cropping schedules for farmers in a way that reduces pest growth and helps to manage limited water resources, maximizing rice yields.

40|$|Abrupt {{systemic}} {{changes in}} ecological and socio-economic systems are a regular occurrence. While {{there has been}} much attention to studying systemic changes primarily in ecology as well as in economics, the attempts to do so for coupled <b>socio-environmental</b> <b>systems</b> are rarer. This paper bridges the gap by reviewing how models can be instrumental in exploring significant, fundamental changes in such systems. The history of modelling systemic change in various disciplines contains a range of definitions and approaches. Even so, most of these efforts share some common challenges within the modelling context. We propose a framework drawing these challenges together, and use it to discuss the articles in this thematic issue on modelling systemic change in coupled social and environmental systems. The differing approaches used highlight that modelling systemic change is an area of endeavour that would benefit from greater synergies between the various disciplines concerned with systemic change...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{an economic}} agent-based model {{of an urban}} housing market. The RHEA (Risks and Hedonics in Empirical Agent-based land market) model captures natural hazard risks and environmental amenities through hedonic analysis, facilitating empirical agent-based land market modeling. RHEA is well grounded in economic theory and uses rich spatial data and econometric analysis. It moves beyond the existing work by explicitly simulating the emergence of property prices and their spatial distribution under adaptive price expectations of heterogeneous agents, advancing toward empirical modeling of agent-based land markets. At the same time RHEA operates in a realistic GIS landscape where realtor and households agents form ask and bid prices using empirical hedonic price functions. The simulation results demonstrate that this combination of theoretically sound micro-foundations in agents’ behavior and empirical data is feasible. This opens opportunities to explore various methodological and policy-relevant research questions including exploration of abrupt non-marginal changes in markets and regime shifts in coupled <b>socio-environmental</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|E

40|$|Coupled socio-ecological systems (SES) {{are complex}} systems {{characterized}} by self-organization, non-linearities, interactions among heterogeneous elements within each subsystem, and feedbacks across scales and among subsystems. When {{such a system}} experiences a shock or a crisis, the consequences are difficult to predict. In this paper we first define what a shock or a crisis means for SES. Depending on where the system boundary is drawn, shocks {{can be seen as}} exogenous or endogenous. For example, human intervention in environmental systems could be seen as exogenous, but endogenous in a <b>socio-environmental</b> <b>system.</b> This difference in the origin and nature of shocks has certain consequences for coupled SES and for policies to ameliorate negative consequences of shocks. Having defined shocks, the paper then focuses on modelling challenges when studying shocks in coupled SES. If we are to explore, study and predict the responses of coupled SES to shocks, the models used {{need to be able to}} accommodate (exogenous) or produce (endogenous) a shock event. Various modelling choices need to be made. Specifically, the ‘sudden’ aspect of a shock suggests the time period over which an event claimed to be a shock occurred might be ‘quick’. What does that mean for a discrete event model? Turning to magnitude, what degree of change (in a variable or set of variables) is required for the event to be considered a shock? The ‘surprising’ nature of a shock means that none of the agents in the model should expect the shock to happen, but may need rules enabling them to generate behaviour in exceptional circumstances. This requires a certain design of the agents’ decision-making algorithms, their perception of a shock, memory of past events and formation of expectations, and the information available to them during the time the shock occurred...|$|R

What is proposed here, ie redesign of the territory aiming at sustainable development, in terms of Social Design, not only coincides with the planning, but also through the adoption of appropriate instruments of production and transfer of information and knowledge and data management, in order to enhance the qualitative and quantitative value-resources who insist on territories and to assess the resilience of the latter, namely their ability to adapt to many changes in recent decades that make them more vulnerable.

We first outline the international scenario, and then go on, in the second part of the paper, to provide a reading of environmental policy on these islands.

We furthermore build a mathematical model that gives a mechanistic view of the dynamics and demonstrates that alternative stable states are an expected property of water reservoirs. We also build a stochastic version of this model that fits well to the data. These results highlight the broader aspect that reservoir management must account for their intrinsic bistability, and should benefit from dynamical systems theory.

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{consists of}} three parts: an outline of {{the recent history of}} IIASA's research activities in the area of economic development; a brief discussion of questions for future research; and thoughts on approaches to responding those questions. The historical sketch touches upon IIASA's earlier research addressing various aspects of economic development; the program on technological development run jointly by IIASA and Tokyo Institute of Technology in 2000 - 2008; the initiative of several National Member Organizations, aimed at establishing research on economic growth at IIASA (2004 - 2005); and the internal cross-program Driving Forces of Economic Growth initiative (www. iiasa. ac. at/Research/ECG) set up in 2007. The questions proposed for future research are motivated by experiences from IIASA's earlier work. A departure point would be viewing economic development {{as part of a larger}} <b>socio-environmental</b> <b>system.</b> A sharper view suggests that economic development is the interface between economic drivers and economic constraints. Economic drivers include, along with traditionally analyzed factors such as human capital and technological innovation, also the very modern ones - infrastructures development, institutional systems, knowledge exchange, and others - whose impact on the pace of economic development has not been studied in that detail. Economic constraints emerge, primarily, as feedbacks from the environment, in forms of climate change, natural disasters, exhaustible resources, etc. The research questions to be addressed can, therefore, be embedded into a general problem formulation - how to develop economic drivers under economic constraints? Applied systems analysis - IIASA's research paradigm - may help IIASA effectively address such questions and define IIASA's specific niche in research on global economic development. In particular, a useful approach would be representing/modeling the economy as a dynamic network that interconnects different economic drivers and different economic constraints through input-output- and feedback-type relationships, with taking into account possible hindrances and shocks in the network's operation. Another approach would be justification and assessment of scenarios of economic development. Systems analysis assumes that modeling and analytic approaches are complemented by regional case studies.

40|$|Section 3. Integrated <b>socio-environmental</b> modellingAssessing {{landscape}} <b>systems</b> {{in relation}} to ecosystem services requires {{the ability to work}} at scales consistent with the service being evaluated. To support such assessments, a nested-scale framework of land use scenarios is proposed. Using scenarios, coherent assumptions on potential land use changes are specifically constructed to deduce landscape consequences. The approach uses a single modelling tool, LandSFACTS, to create potential land use patterns corresponding to the proposed scenario conditions. The model considers simple spatio-temporal constraints on land uses or cropping systems and its inputs are adaptable to multiple scales and scenario needs. The landscapes incorporating the simulated land use patterns can then be assessed for ecosystem services such as habitat networks and crop production at the required scale. The common approach across scales supports the analysis of benefits at multiple levels, and thus will facilitate a coherent assessment of ecosystem services across scales. Scenarios and their evaluation are iteratively refined through comparison between scale specific conclusions. The framework is currently being applied to the North-East of Scotland region, the Dee catchment and Tarland sub-catchment. Preliminary conclusions of the project are reported...|$|R
40|$|Artisanal {{fisheries}} {{constitute a}} considerable source of employment, income, and protein for many coastal {{communities in the}} Caribbean. One of the region?s most valuable fisheries is for mutton snapper (Lutjanus analis), a coral-reef fish that uses various habitats throughout its life cycle, aggregates to spawn at specific places and times, and is considered vulnerable to extinction. This dissertation focuses on the mutton snapper spawning aggregation fishery at Gladden Spit, Belize (western Caribbean), which has existed since the 1950 s. In 2000, the Government of Belize partnered with a community-based nongovernment organization, fishers, and other stakeholders to conserve and co-manage the artisanal fishery. Considering the study fishery as an adaptive <b>socio-environmental</b> fisher-fish <b>system,</b> this dissertation uses a holistic approach to provide baseline socioeconomic and biological information for strengthening conservation and management of mutton snapper fisheries in Belize, applicable {{to the rest of}} the Caribbean. The three overall goals of this dissertation were to 1) present the history of the fishery and delineate for the first time its socio-environmental development and impact on inter-annual catch dynamics and yields, using published and grey literature, knowledge of experienced fishers and stakeholders, and data from landings surveys; 2) characterize the fishery?s within-season dynamics in 2011 through analyses of the variability in fishing activity, catch and bycatch, and in size, age, and maturation of reproductive mutton snapper, and 3) evaluate the potential distribution of habitat for early life stages of mutton snapper across the Belize shelf, using a GIS-based multi-criteria modeling approach evaluated in the field. Inter-annual analyses evidenced a considerable reduction in total landings and fishing effort of the fishery in the late 1980 s, parallel to a rapid growth in the tourism industry and to a shift in the livelihoods of many local fishers. Between 1999 and 2011, during the co-management period of the fishery, relatively stable values of annual catch per unit effort (CPUE), individual sizes, and sex ratios suggested persistence of the fishery. Otolith, size, and gonad analyses depicted, for the first time for the species, age-, size-, and maturation-structured mutton snapper spawning aggregations. Within-season analyses showed how mutton snapper size, age, and degree of maturation vary in relation to the lunar cycle and throughout the spawning season, with individuals significantly smaller and females mostly immature later in the season. Overall, the within-season dynamics of the fishery were influenced by the lunar and seasonal patterns in the reproductive biology of mutton snapper, interactions with co-occurring fisheries, and the experience and traditions of local fishers. The GIS-based model provided a common spatial framework for guiding conservation and spatial management of mutton snapper in Belize and highlighted a low degree of protection currently afforded to critical juvenile habitats constituted of mangroves and seagrass from coastal and shelf regions...|$|R
40|$|Inspired by the {{challenges}} of environmental change and the resource limitations experienced by modern society, recent decades have seen an increased interest in understanding the collapse of past societies.

40|$|Land Degradation (LD) in <b>socio-environmental</b> <b>systems</b> {{negatively}} impacts {{sustainable development}} paths. This study proposes a framework to LD evaluation based on indicators of diversification in the {{spatial distribution of}} sensitive land. We hypothesize that conditions for spatial heterogeneity in a composite index of land sensitivity are more frequently associated to areas prone to LD than spatial homogeneity. Spatial heterogeneity {{is supposed to be}} associated with degraded areas that may act as hotspots for future degradation processes. A diachronic analysis (1960 - 2010) was carried out at the agricultural district scale in Italy to identify environmental factors associated to spatial heterogeneity in the level of land sensitivity to degradation based on the Environmentally Sensitive Area Index (ESAI). In 1960, diversification in the level of land sensitivity measured through two common indexes of entropy (Shannon's diversity and Pielou's evenness) increased significantly with the ESAI, indicating a high level of land sensitivity to degradation. In 2010, surface area classified as 'critical' to LD was the highest in districts with evident diversification in the spatial distribution of ESAI values, confirming the hypothesis formulated above. Entropy indexes, based on observed alignment with the concept of LD, constitute a valuable base to inform mitigation strategies against desertification...|$|E

Nesse contexto, a presente pesquisa teve como objetivo elaborar uma proposta de Zoneamento- Antrópico-Ambiental para o Município de Iporã do Oeste-SC, a partir da caracterização e análise dos fatores socioeconômicos e ambientais juntamente com as perspectivas da população local. O embasamento teórico foi fundamentado na abordagem sistêmica. Metodologicamente a pesquisa centrou-se na proposta de Libault (1971), o qual aborda os quatro níveis da pesquisa geográfica. Para a elaboração do Zoneamento-Antrópico-Ambiental do Município de Iporã do Oeste-SC, foram delimitadas duas microbacias hidrográficas com base no Projeto Microbacias II, a microbacia hidrográfica do Lajeado Pirapó (MHLP) e a microbacia Hidrográfica do Lajeado Esperança, (MHLE), as quais apresentaram particularidades (relevo, uso da terra e localização) e relevância socioeconômica para o contexto local. Os resultados compreenderam a elaboração de diferentes produtos cartográficos (uso da terra, declividade, hipsometria, legislação e conflitos ambientais), confeccionados a partir do software Spring 4. 2. 1. Tais produtos foram sobrepostos gerando três zonas de uso e ocupação para ambas as microbacias. As zonas definidas foram: Zona de Uso e Ocupação Moderada (ZUOM); Zona de Uso e Ocupação Restrita (ZUOR) e Zona de Uso e Ocupação Controlada (ZUOC). A ZUOR predomina nas duas microbacias com um total de 54, 66 % de 2. 176, 09 ha da MHLP e, 41, 96 % de 2. 823, 85 da MHLE. A partir daí, cada zona foi caracterizada, destacando as potencialidades e limitações existentes, gerando um cenário atual e a incentivar, a partir das perspectivas ou projetos elencados pela população residente em cada microbacia. A proposta pretende contribuir para a discussão e a reflexão sobre as formas atuais e potenciais de uso e ocupação do espaço, orientando as tomadas de decisões por parte dos planejadores e pesquisadores, juntamente com a comunidade local, visando assim, o desenvolvimento socioeconômico e o equilíbrio do sistema socioambiental como um todo. Among, {{the mechanisms}} {{returned to the}} environmental planning {{at the present time}} and possible of they be implanted in the territorial administration, the zoning-entropicenvironmental has shown as a strategic instrument in the decisions-making, which it looks for compatibiling the socioeconomic development and to maintain or to preserve the environmental quality of a certain territory. In that context, to present research it had as objective elaborates a proposal of Zoning-Entropic-environmental for the Municipal district of Iporã of West-SC, starting from the characterization and analysis of the socioeconomic and environmental factors together with the perspectives of the local population. The theoretical basement was based in the systemic approach. Methodologically the research was centered in the Libault proposal (1971), which approaches the four levels of the geographical research. For the elaboration of the Zoning-Entropic-environmental of the Municipal district of Iporã of West-SC, two micro basin hydrographic were delimited with base in the Micro basins Project II, the micro basin hydrographic of Lajeado Pirapó (MHLP) and the micro basin Hydrographic of the Lajeado Esperança, (MHLE), which presented particularities (relieve, earth using and location) and socioeconomic relevance for the local context. The results understood the elaboration of different cartographic products (earth using, steepness, hypsometry, legislation and environmental conflicts), made starting from the software Spring 4. 2. 1. Such products were put upon generating three use areas and occupation for both micro basins. The defined areas were: Use Area and Moderate Occupation (ZUOM); Use Area and Restricted Occupation (ZUOR) and Use Area and Controlled Occupation (ZUOC). ZUOR prevails in the two micro basins with a total of 54, 66 % of 2. 176, 09 of the MHLP and, 41, and 96 % of 2. 823, 85 of MHLE. Since then, each area was characterized, detaching the potentialities and existent limitations, generating a current scenery and to motivate, starting from the perspectives or developed projects for the resident population in each micro basin. The proposal intends to contribute for the discussion and the reflection about the current forms and use potentials and occupation of the space, guiding the decisions-making {{on the part of the}} planners and researchers, together with the local community, seeking like this, the socioeconomic development and the balance of the <b>system</b> <b>socio-environmental</b> as a completely...|$|R
40|$|While almost 87 % of the world’s {{population}} now {{has access}} to an improved drinking water source, the risk of water pollution remains, often due to environmental factors such as increasing urbanization and industrialization. Last year, as the country watched the tragic Flint, Michigan tap water quality deterioration unfold, the issue was brought closer to home: How good is Baltimore’s water system? Baltimore’s water source is primarily surface water, which feeds into the Liberty, Loch Raven and Prettyboy reservoirs. The Socio-Environmental Synthesis (SES) approach was used to investigate the {{factors that contribute to}} water quality impairment. SES is a research method that integrates existing knowledge and data from natural and social sciences to advance understanding of <b>socio-environmental</b> <b>systems.</b> The study found out that while the quality of the drinking water is generally good, there is a growing concern with the quality of water in the watersheds. The high levels of nitrate-nitrogen and increased concentrations of carbon dioxide are especially alarming. The high levels of Biological Oxygen Demand are also good indicators of the intensity of agriculture and urbanization in the watersheds. This study believes that maximizing the current watershed conservation and restoration efforts would reduce the treatment costs and safeguard the urban water supplies...|$|E
40|$|Accelerating glacier {{recession}} in tropical highlands {{and in the}} Peruvian Andes specifically is a manifestation {{of global climate change}} that is influencing the hydrologic cycle and impacting water resources across a range of <b>socio-environmental</b> <b>systems.</b> Despite predictions regarding the negative effects of long-term glacier decline on water availability, many uncertainties remain regarding the timing and variability of hydrologic changes and their impacts. To improve context-specific understandings of the effects of climate change and glacial melt on water resources in the tropical Andes, this article synthesizes results from long-term transdisciplinary research with new findings from two glacierized Peruvian watersheds to develop and apply a multi-level conceptual framework focused on the coupled biophysical and social determinants of water access and hydro-social risks in these contexts. The framework identifies several interacting variables—hydrologic transformation, land cover change, perceptions of water availability, water use and infrastructure in local and regional economies, and water rights and governance—to broadly assess how glacier change is embedded with social risks and vulnerability across diverse water uses and sectors. The primary focus is on the Santa River watershed draining the Cordillera Blanca to the Pacific. Additional analysis of hydrologic change and water access in the geographically distinct Shullcas River watershed draining the Huaytapallana massif towards the city of Huancayo further illuminates the heterogeneous character of hydrologic risk and vulnerability in the Andes...|$|E
40|$|As {{significant}} {{impacts of}} climate change are increasingly considered unavoidable, adaptation has become a policy priority. It is generally agreed that science {{is important for the}} adaptation process but specific guidance on how and to what degree science should contribute and be embedded in this process is still limited which is at odds with the high demand for science contributions to climate adaptation by international organizations, national governments and others. Here we present and analyze experiences from the tropical Andes based on a recent science-policy process on the national and supra-national government level. During this process a framework for the science contribution in climate adaptation has been developed; it consists of three stages, including (1) the framing and problem definition, (2) the scientific assessment of climate, impacts, vulnerabilities and risks, and (3) the evaluation of adaptation options and their implementation. A large amount of methods has been analyzed for stage (2), and a number of major climate adaptation projects in the region assessed for (3). Our study underlines the importance of joint problem framing among various scientific and non-scientific actors, definition of <b>socio-environmental</b> <b>systems,</b> time frames, and a more intense interaction of social and physical climate and impact sciences. Scientifically, the scarcity of environmental, social and economic data in regions like the Andes continue to represent a limitation to adaptation, and further investments into coordinated socio-environmental monitoring, data availability and sharing are essential...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{new forms}} of combined and integrated scenario methodologies, which are used to construct exploratory socio-environmental scenarios. It makes conceptual and empirical contributions to futures studies and to inter- and transdisciplinary environmental and sustainability research. For 15 years, scenario approaches {{for the construction of}} socio-environmental scenarios have been established, which combine qualitative scenario methods with numerical modeling and simulation. They have become state of the art by replacing scenario approaches based on modeling alone. Combined scenario approaches are used to explore the future of <b>socio-environmental</b> <b>systems</b> scientifically, and to supply society and policy makers with the best possible information on possible alternative future developments in climate, biodiversity, land use, water, resources and energy, etc. Combined scenarios are characterized by a deep methodological and epistemological hybridity, as they combine approaches and perspectives from different realms. This makes their appeal but also raises enormous challenges. At the same time, literature on combined scenarios has thus far provided little conceptual orientation for the comparison, design, assessment and implementation of different forms of combined approaches. In practice, the so-called Story and Simulation (SAS) approach is dominant, coupling intuitive scenarios with simulation, and postulating an iterative refinement of both components. Against this background, this study explores new avenues: Cross-impact balance analysis (CIB), a systematic-formalized yet qualitative form of systems analysis, is combined with numerical modeling and simulation (CIB&S). As yet, this approach was explored neither empirically nor conceptually in a systematic way. Still, in energy and climate research, the expectation is formulated that this approach might balance the difficulties of combined scenario approaches of the SAS type, especially with regard to traceability and consistency. This study asks whether and how CIB can be combined with numerical modeling and simulation to support inter- and transdisciplinary research teams in constructing qualitative and quantitative or integrated exploratory scenarios of <b>socio-environmental</b> <b>systems.</b> It focuses on forms of the combination of CIB&S; on effects on traceability and consistency as well as on further (unintended) effects of the use of CIB within such combinations; and finally on factors influencing these effects. Combined scenario approaches are conceptualized in this study as inter- and transdisciplinary methodologies. Each application is characterized by an individual social, technical and data-related organization. Based on {{a review of the literature}} on combined scenario approaches, central dimensions to characterize forms of the combination of qualitative and quantitative scenario methods are developed. In addition, a model of the typical phases of a CIB&S process is designed. To assess effects, working definitions of scenario traceability and scenario consistency are proposed and operationalized. This conceptual framework structures the empirical analysis of two exploratory case studies. The first case studies a method demonstration for the German Federal Environment Agency (UBA). In this case, CIB is used to analyze societal framework assumptions of environmental models and to construct plausible sets of assumptions until the year 2030. The second case studies a full pioneer application of CIB&S in the context of a megacity project for the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF). In the latter case, CIB is combined with a material flow simulator, to construct integrated scenarios on the possible water futures of Lima, Peru, until the year 2040. Both cases are qualitatively analyzed and interpreted, based on participant observation, interviews with process participants as well as process documents. The study shows that in different (ideal typical) forms of its combination with numerical modeling and simulation, CIB takes over different functions. The combined form, in turn, is mainly influenced by the position of both components within the process as well as by their degree of integration. CIB&S methodologies can successfully support scenario traceability, and contribute to both the internal consistency of the qualitative scenario component and the consistency between qualitative and quantitative scenario components. The stronger the degree of integration between CIB and simulation model, the stronger these effects. However, integration requires that the models underlying the scenarios, i. e. the conceptual CIB model as well as the numerical modeling and simulation, are made explicit and accessible, are compared with and, if applicable, adapted to each other. In addition, CIB&S approaches can create new checks and balances within combined scenario methodologies, when the definition of scenarios as well as the selection of scenario samples is assigned to the CIB and to the CIB participants. CIB&S approaches seem to be less suitable for the construction of explicitly normative or participatory scenarios. Instead, CIB&S approaches do support the participating experts in better analyzing, structuring and reflecting their knowledge, their assumptions and their ideas on possible future developments of <b>socio-environmental</b> <b>systems.</b> The external users of CIB&S-based scenarios can benefit from the improved accessibility of assumptions on uncertainty and complexity, which underlie the qualitative and quantitative or integrated scenarios, as these become criticizable in the first place. Overall, this study makes steps toward more conceptually grounded and more reflective research on the diversity of possible variants of combined and integrated scenario methodologies...|$|E
40|$|I {{argue that}} {{contemporary}} struggles with sustainability {{must be addressed}} {{from the perspective of}} critical cultural analysis that identifies attitudes and behaviors as rooted in specific worldviews, narratives, metaphors, and belief systems, and that challenges and re-envisions these structures of thought in order to reformulate new alternative conceptual frameworks for positive interaction with the more-than-human world. I define this pursuit of critical cultural reflection and creative conceptual transformation as critical ecoliteracy, and I propose the incorporation of its goals and practices into educational curricula in secondary and post-secondary humanities classrooms. I outline a list of conceptual resources that I consider essential for engaging in critical ecoliteracy and for developing an approach to the world that values and considers the full, interconnected community of life in our global ecosystem. These skills and capacities include the practice of empathy; an understanding and appreciation of ecological and relational interdependence; ethical consciousness; an awareness of local and global <b>socio-environmental</b> <b>systems</b> and problems; critical awareness of the role that language and discourse play in shaping attitudes and behaviors; knowledge of the varying worldviews and belief systems of different cultures; a capacity for imagining creative alternative future paths; and a sense of agency to enact change. I encourage the development of critical ecoliteracy curriculum materials that cultivate this set of capacities. I next describe pedagogical strategies I recommend employing when applying critical ecoliteracy materials in school settings, and I offer my own model critical ecoliteracy curriculum as an example of these goals and approaches. In order to assess the potential value of such a curriculum, I test my materials in classrooms by teaching them myself and by asking a volunteer teacher to use them. I then analyze student writing, survey results, and teacher feedback in order to gauge the effect of the curriculum materials on student thinking. Using qualitative content analysis, I explore the patterns of reactions presented by students in response to the materials, and I draw conclusions as to how effective the model curriculum may be at achieving the goals of critical ecoliteracy that I have outlined...|$|E
40|$|Land use {{change in}} rural areas often result from the {{decision-making}} of individual farming households. It is a complex process that operates at different temporal and spatial scales through the interactions between diverse drivers. Main drivers of wetland conversion for agricultural production in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and those influencing its land use change have been explored in the past. But often the factors have not been explicitly considered in these studies. Tools and concepts that consider the decision-making processes of farmers have become common approaches used in studies to understand and explore changes in land use. This paper describes an empirical model framework to analyse land development and use processes {{as a result of}} individual farmer’s decision-making in small wetlands in SSA. The model framework uses information on the drivers of land use change, landscape classification, and household typologies. Processes of land conversion, as well as of probabilistic and heuristic decision-making were integrated in the framework. The model framework was applied to a case study on a sub-humid lowland floodplain in Tanzania, where land conversion, fallow, and use change processes are shaping the structure of the wetland. The scenario of increasing land scarcity on upland was simulated to explore how defined processes will respond to the rising pressure exerted on the wetland. Land conversion increased by 10 percent, fallow practices decreased by one-third to half. Wetland fields were defragmented due to increasing demand for crop production in the wetland. Shifts in relative distributions of farm types were simulated within and between wetland cluster groups, where all upland dependent crop-based farmers disappeared. The application revealed the potential of including individual decision-making in understanding the heterogeneity and functioning of such systems. The application possibilities and limitations of the model as well as challenges to model complex interactions in land use systems are discussed. The study raised the need to improve the means by which <b>socio-environmental</b> <b>systems</b> are anticipated and managed in the face of likely or projected changes in demography, economics, and resources at different scale...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} growing {{interest}} lately {{in the role of}} microfinance to support environmental management of micro-enterprises and poor households. Worldwide, the number of green microfinance projects increases, yet there seems to be little discussion on how effective green microfinance is in achieving its environmental goals. This paper aims to position itself in this debate. We look at the first large-scale green microfinance programme for biodiversity conservation: Proyecto CAMBio. It consists of a combination of credits, technical assistance and conditional payments for environmentally friendly agricultural activities (PES). We focus on its implementation in Nicaragua by the microfinance institution FDL and the NGO Nitlapan. We perform an in-depth econometric analysis of a survey we conducted on a sample of 128 rural producers. We assess the clients’ characteristics that influenced the evolution of the environmental value of their farm –as defined by the indicators we used– on a span of five years, and we assess Proyecto CAMBio’s possible role in this evolution. Moreover, we further look into the effectiveness of PES in rewarding environmental betterment. Factors such as the decision to change the main economic activities, or clients’ strategies or opportunities in land accumulationappear to have the strongest influence on the evolution of the environmental value of the clients’ farm. While the project per se, even if carefully implemented in agreement with its guidelines and well performing at financial level, {{does not appear to have}} significantly influenced the evolution of the environmental value of the clients’ farm. Moreover, the PES does not seem to reward environmental improvement while instead it rewards the more credit-worthy activities, producers with more access to land and credit and in addition producers that plant fewer trees per hectare. With these results, we underline the importance of the local territorial dynamics and the complexity of the <b>socio-environmental</b> <b>systems</b> against a vision based simply on single economic actors. From our results it appears that green microfinance, without strategic articulation with local actors and broader territorial dynamics, would tend to (indirectly) support preexisting socioeconomic structures and the possibly related environmental degradation processes. We hence call for a more proactive engagement of green microfinance in the territorial dynamics and with local actors with the aim to support more sustainable livelihood trajectories and development pathways. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn Amazonia, our {{knowledge}} of the trade-offs and possible thresholds in the relationships among social, economic and environmental parameters remains quite limited and hinders the design of sustainable <b>socio-environmental</b> <b>systems.</b> To fill this gap, we analyzed relationships among landscape metrics, socio- economic patterns, biodiversity and soil-based ecosystem services within a total of 51 farms located at 6 sites of the Colombian and Brazilian Amazon. Farms were representative of an initial set of 274 and they represented colonization ages from 10 to 80 years and a range of public policies found in the region. Two farms were abandoned in Colombia for local reasons. Cluster analysis separated farms in 7 types of production systems according to 5 main criteria (size of the farm, human capital, incomes, farm products and production intensity) selected from an initial set of 18 criteria. Biodiversity was summarized into a composite index Bd built with data from 8 different groups: trees, shrubs, grasses and forbs, birds, Saturnidae and Sphingidae moths, Drosophilidae, earthworms and ants. Provision of ecosystem services was quantified by a composite indicator of 6 sub- indicators of soil hydrological functions, C storage and chemical fertility. Increasing intensity of production systems was linked to a significant decrease of indicators of natural capital biodiversity (Bd) and soil based ecosystem services (Es) with 20 % and 37. 3 % variance explained, respectively. No relationship was observed between production systems and an indicator of human wellbeing (Sb) based on a set of 5 criteria identified with the farmers. Findings indicate that early colonizers migrate when a certain level of development has been achieved (as a result of their activities) and are replaced by wealthier populations. An overall indicator of sustainability (Su) – that combines production efficiency (Ep), Sb, Bd and Es indices (ranging from 0. 1 – 1. 0) – decreases significantly with the landscape intensification (Li) with 18. 7 % variance directly explained by this relationship. Su was also significantly related to production systems (36. 4 % variance explained) : while this indicator remained relatively stable with a value of 0. 5 across the early and intermediate phases following deforestation, it dropped down considerably (0. 2) for production systems based on cattle ranching on highly degraded pastures with less than 2 % forest cover remaining. Restoration with sylvopastoral systems allowed some farms of this former group to increase sustainability to a value of 0. 35 after less than 5 years. Agroforestry systems on sites deforested at the same time maintained values around 0. 5, as they allowed the maximum production efficiencies and maintained relatively high values of the Biodiversity (Bd) and Ecosystem services (Es) indexes. This is evidence that beyond the general negative trade-off between human development and natural capital observed in Amazonia, agro ecological options to revert the trend are quite promising. A general methodological approach for the reconstruction of sustainable landscapes in farms of the deforested Amazonian region is proposed as a conclusion...|$|E
