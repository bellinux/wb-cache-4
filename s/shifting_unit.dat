40|$|Load flow studies {{concerning}} the power exchange {{in the border}} region of Belgium and France, {{have shown that the}} old but important 220 kV line between the RTE substation of Chooz (F) and the Elia substation of Monceau (B) could go into a serious overload condition in case of failure or maintenance on other transnational power lines or in case of outages on neighbouring interconnection transformers. The importance of this power line to the industrial Charleroi (B) region obliges special measures to be taken to protect the line against overloading while staying in service at all possible grid conditions. The chosen solution consists in implementing a phase shifting autotransformer (PST) in the 150 kV substation of Monceau. The main characteristics were deduced from the results of the load flow calculations (the simulations were done with and without a phase <b>shifting</b> <b>unit)</b> : a 220 / 150 kV 400 MVA autotransformer (with OLTC for voltage regulation) able to provoke a phase displacement between the 220 kV and 155 kV sides in the range of – 15 ° + 3 ° at full load; also by means of an OLTC. From these characteristics, it is clear that shifting away the overload current is the main purpose of the unit. The implementation of the phase shifting transformer has also several operational consequences. Not only the protection, control and command of the unit, but also various (external) grid events (lightning strokes, single and multiple phase line faults, autoreclose of the circuit breakers) affect the design of the PST. The transformer itself will have an influence on the power flow behaviour of the grid, the protection schemes and the automatic systems in the substation. It is obvious that a close cooperation and exchange of mathematical simulation models (of both grid and transformer) between the grid operator and the manufacturer is necessary to cover all possible operational issues before the putting into service of the transformer in march 2006. With these experiences, the authors develop the expertise for the grid behaviour studies and transformer performance for new PST implementations such as 400 / 400 kV 1400 MVA phase shifting transformers to be placed at the electrical border between Belgium and the Netherlands. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|A {{metrology}} system that contains no moving parts simultaneously measures the bearings and ranges of multiple reflective targets in its vicinity, enabling {{determination of the}} three-dimensional (3 D) positions of the targets with submillimeter accuracy. The system combines a direction-measuring metrology camera and an interferometric range-finding subsystem. Because the system is based partly on a prior instrument denoted the Modulation Sideband Technology for Absolute Ranging (MSTAR) sensor and because of its 3 D capability, the system is denoted the MSTAR 3 D. Developed for use in measuring the shape (for the purpose of compensating for distortion) of large structures like radar antennas, {{it can also be}} used to measure positions of multiple targets in the course of conventional terrestrial surveying. A diagram of the system is shown in the figure. One of the targets is a reference target having a known, constant distance with respect to the system. The system comprises a laser for generating local and target beams at a carrier frequency; a frequency <b>shifting</b> <b>unit</b> to introduce a frequency shift offset between the target and local beams; a pair of high-speed modulators that apply modulation to the carrier frequency in the local and target beams to produce a series of modulation sidebands, the highspeed modulators having modulation frequencies of FL and FM; a target beam launcher that illuminates the targets with the target beam; optics and a multipixel photodetector; a local beam launcher that launches the local beam towards the multi-pixel photodetector; a mirror for projecting to the optics a portion of the target beam reflected from the targets, the optics being configured to focus the portion of the target beam at the multi-pixel photodetector; and a signal-processing unit connected to the photodetector. The portion of the target beam reflected from the targets produces spots on the multi-pixel photodetector corresponding to the targets, respectively, and the signal-processing unit centroids the spots to determine bearings of the targets, respectively.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{construction}} of a simple beam steered phased array antenna was undertaken to demonstrate the operational principles behind such devices. The antenna {{can be used as}} a receiver or transmitter, however power requirements dictated that the antenna be tested as a receiver. The design is modular to allow for redevelopment without complete reconstruction. The array is made up of the control module, voltage controlled attenuators and a phase <b>shifting</b> <b>unit.</b> The antenna consists of 16 quarter wave monopoles arranged in a 4 X 4 square array on an aluminium ground plane. Practical considerations lead to a carrier frequency of 200 MHz. The heart of a phased array antenna is the phase shifting device. This device controls the direction in which the main radiation lobe propagates. Several phase shifting principles were investigated but time did not allow for an exhaustive investigation of every kind of phase shifter. Initially, a relatively new and novel approach was attempted. When this proved to be unachievable a more traditional (but far less elegant) method was used. During the phase shifting process, the signal necessarily suffers attenuation as well as the designed phase shift, consequently it is necessary to tailor the signal amplitudes of each array element. The required amplitude control is achieved through the use of 16 voltage controlled attenuators. A computer package is used to control the phase shifter and attenuators. The design of this package depends on only three factors. The first is the interface between the hardware and the computer (via a serial port in this case). The second factor is the type of control signal the phase shifter and attenuators respond to (in this case a dc voltage). The third factor is the range of voltage required for the phase shifter and attenuators so that their full range can be utilised. This is realised through the use of a microprocessor, a "sample and hold" circuit and several D/A converters. The antenna and computer control package are essentially independent of each other. If an 8 bit digital phase shifter were to be employed later, the hardware could be used to control this with minimal alteration. In this case the advantage of a modular design is apparent. Various parts of the device can be incrementally improved without alteration to the remaining system. Radical change can be accommodated with minimal adjustments...|$|E

Shift is defined as the deviation that occurs in the translation products taking place only on the elements that construct the patterns without eliminating the originally contextual meanings. Essentially, there are four major kinds of shift, namely: structure <b>shift,</b> class <b>shift,</b> <b>unit</b> <b>shift,</b> and intra-system shift. Moreover, this study aimed to investigate the kinds of shifts formulated and the reasons of formulating those shifts in translating Indonesian songs. The descriptive qualitative research design, in the form of document analysis, was employed in this study. The instruments to collect the data were documents and interview guide. Moreover, the documents consisted of the translation versions of Dekat di Hati, 1000 Tahun Lamanya, Teman Hidup, and Terlalu Lama Sendiri songs. Furthermore, the structured interview was piloted. This study revealed that all Indonesian songs, Dekat di Hati, 1000 Tahun Lamanya, Teman Hidup, and Terlalu Lama Sendiri, contained all kinds of category shift, covering structure, class, <b>unit,</b> and intra-system <b>shifts.</b> In addition, Dekat di Hati song possessed 62 shifts, 1000 Tahun Lamanya song possessed 41 shifts, Teman Hidup song possessed 67 shifts, and Terlalu Lama Sendiri song possessed 109 shifts.
