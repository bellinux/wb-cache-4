50|$|Numerous methods {{exist for}} {{determining}} appropriate emissions standards, and different regulatory approaches {{may be taken}} depending on the source, industry, and air pollutant under review. Specific limits may be set by reference to and {{within the confines of}} more general air quality standards. Specific sources may be regulated by means of performance standards, meaning numerical limits on the emission of a specific pollutant from that <b>source</b> <b>category.</b> Regulators may also mandate the adoption and use of specific control technologies, often with reference to feasibility, availability, and cost. Still other standards may be set using performance as a benchmark - for example, requiring all of a specific type of facility to meet the emissions limits achieved by the best performing facility of the group. All of these methods may be modified by incorporating emissions averaging, market mechanisms such as emissions trading, and other alternatives.|$|E
40|$|The National Emission Inventory (NEI) {{includes}} criteria pollutants {{and hazardous}} air pollutants (HAPs) from all stationary and mobile sources. The mobile source emissions component of NEI contains estimates for onroad as well as nonroad <b>source</b> <b>categories.</b> Nonroad <b>source</b> <b>categories</b> include, aircraft, commercial marine vessel (CMV), locomotive, and “other ” nonroad vehicle and engines 1.

The nonroad emission estimates have been significantly improved in the 1999 NEI, {{both in terms of}} the quality of the emissions estimates which were developed and the refinement of the spatial allocation methods used. This paper discusses the methods used and improvements made to estimate emissions for the other nonroad emission sources.

40|$|A {{review was}} {{conducted}} of the published literature on source apportionment of ambient particulate matter (PM) in Europe using receptor models (RMs). Consistent records were identified for source contribution estimates of PM mass concentrations for 272 records and of organic carbon (OC) in PM for 60 records. Over the period 2000 - 2012, a shift {{was observed in}} the use of RMs from principal component analysis, enrichment factors, and classical factor analysis to positive matrix factorization while chemical mass balance is still topical. Following a meta-analysis of the published results, six major <b>source</b> <b>categories</b> for PM were defined that comprise almost all individual sources apportioned in Europe: atmospheric formation of secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA), traffic, re-suspension of crustal/mineral dust, biomass burning, (industrial) point sources, and sea/road salt. For the OC fraction, the three main <b>source</b> <b>categories</b> were: atmospheric formation of secondary organic aerosol, biomass burning, and fossil fuel combustion. The geographical and seasonal variation of these sources are mapped and discussed. A special analysis of PM concentrations that exceed the current European air quality limits indicated SIA and traffic as the most important <b>source</b> <b>categories</b> to target for abatement throughout the year together with biomass burning during the cold season.
