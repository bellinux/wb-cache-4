40|$|The paper reveals {{results of}} {{investigations}} on mass transfer kinetics and dynamics of coating formation while using integral electrospark alloying method with additional ultrasonic exposure {{at different stages}} of formation. Nowadays, a classical method for electrospark alloying with hard-alloy anodes and impulse AC voltage frequency on the vibration exciter coil from 20 to 1600 Hz has been mainly used for application of protective and strengthening coatings within permissible thickness and characteristics. The key aspect of ultrasonic exposure application (frequency 22 – 44 kHz) during electrospark alloying is the possibility to increase further thickness of coatings to be formed even after reaching a brittle fracture threshold of the coating material. Methodology of the executed research activity has been based on integrated studies (gravimetric, metallographic, X-ray diffraction and electron microscopic) of coatings which are to be formed through compositions produced while using method of high-energy hot compaction and a “refractory carbide (WC) and a binding material“ system in the form of alloy based on nickel from the series of “colmonoy” Ni – Ni 3 B system which is alloyed with additions of copper and silicon. The initial surface treatment within ultrasonic frequency range (22 – 44 kHz) contributes to a noticeable increase in the mass transfer rate, which is primarily determined by chemical composition and thermodynamic stability of anodes. It is due to surface activation in the process of its preliminary deformation at ultrasonic frequency which creates additional conditions for <b>striking</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spark.</b> The final ultrasonic treatment improves coating quality due to its additional forging that leads to an increase of its structure homogeneity and density. </p...|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>spark</b> {{arrester}} {{is often}} installed within the smokebox. This {{may take the}} form <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cylindrical mesh running {{from the top of}} the blast pipe to the bottom of the chimney. The purpose <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spark</b> arrester is to prevent excessively large fragments of hot ash from being exhausted into the environment where they may pose a fire risk. For this reason, spark arresters are generally installed on locomotives running through dry environments. They should not be confused with the external spark arrestors fitted to some locomotives. The presence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spark</b> arrester may have a thermodynamic effect, distorting the draw of air over the fire and thereby reducing total power output. Thus their use can be contentious.|$|R

Therefore, the main focus of this work is to investigate how effective laser-triggering is in the case <b>of</b> <b>an</b> orthogonally arranged gap (beam at right angles to the gap axis). The effects of the laser beam intensity, the gap length used and the position of the plasma in the gap were found to play important roles in the breakdown process <b>of</b> <b>an</b> orthogonally triggered gap. It was found that directing and focusing the laser beam at right angles to the gap axis reduces the breakdown voltage of the gap dramatically. An almost 70...|$|R

5000|$|The {{heat range}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spark</b> plug is {{affected}} by the construction of the spark plug: the types of materials used, the length of insulator and the surface area of the plug exposed within the combustion chamber. For normal use, the selection <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>spark</b> plug heat range is a balance between keeping the tip hot enough at idle to prevent fouling and cold enough at maximal power to prevent pre-ignition or engine knocking. By examining [...] "hotter" [...] and [...] "cooler" [...] spark plugs of the same manufacturer side by side, the principle involved can be very clearly seen; the cooler plugs have a more substantial ceramic insulator filling the gap between the center electrode and the shell, effectively allowing more heat to be carried off by the shell, while the hotter plugs have less ceramic material, so that the tip is more isolated from the body of the plug and retains heat better.|$|R
