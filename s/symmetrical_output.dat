Negative and Dual Channel TITO converters are also presented. In steady state one of the PCTITO outputs is positive while the other is negative. Although the outputs could be regulated to provide dif-ferent absolute values, an interesting application of the new converters is to provide <b>symmetrical</b> <b>outputs</b> (i. e., 15 V) to supply balanced loads.

To regulate the outputs, two in-phase equal-switching frequency PWM-based multivariable control loops have been designed.

40|$|SummaryAn {{efficient}} {{strategy to}} explore the environment for available resources involves the execution of random walks where straight line locomotion alternates with changes of direction. This strategy is highly conserved in the animal kingdom, from zooplankton to human hunter-gatherers [1 – 8]. Drosophila larvae execute a routine of this kind, performing straight line crawling interrupted at intervals by pause turns that halt crawling and redirect the trajectory of movement [9 – 11]. The execution of this routine depends solely on the activity of networks located in the thoracic and abdominal segments of the nervous system, while descending input from the brain serves to modify it in a context-dependent fashion [9]. I used a genetic method to investigate the location and function of the circuitry required for the different elements of exploratory crawling. By using the Slit-Robo axon guidance pathway to target neuronal midline crossing defects selectively to particular regions of the thoracic and abdominal networks, it has been possible to define at least three functions required {{for the performance of}} the exploratory routine: (1) <b>symmetrical</b> <b>outputs</b> in thoracic and abdominal segments that generate the crawls; (2) asymmetrical output that is uniquely initiated in the thoracic segments and generates the turns; and (3) an intermittent interruption to crawling that determines the time-dependent transition between crawls and turns...|$|R

40|$|Product {{data sheet}} 1. General {{description}} The HEF 4104 B is a quad low voltage-to-high voltage translator with 3 -state outputs. It provides {{the capability of}} interfacing low voltage circuits to high voltage circuits. For example low voltage Local Oxidation Complementary MOS (LOCMOS) and Transistor-Transistor Logic (TTL) to high voltage LOCMOS. It has four data inputs (A 0 to A 3), an active HIGH output enable input (OE), four data outputs (B 0 to B 3) and their complements (B 0 to B 3). With OE = HIGH, the outputs B 0 to B 3 and B 0 to B 3 are in the low impedance ON-state, either HIGH or LOW {{as determined by the}} inputs A 0 to A 3. With OE = LOW, the outputs B 0 to B 3 and B 0 to B 3 are in the high-impedance OFF-state. It uses a common negative supply (VSS) and separate positive supplies for the inputs (VDD(A)) and the outputs (VDD(B)). VDD(A) must always be {{less than or equal to}} VDD(B), even during power turn-on and turn-off. For the permissible operating range of VDD(A) and VDD(B) see Figure 4. Each input protection circuit is terminated between VDD(B) and VSS. This allows the input signals to be driven from any potential between VDD(B) and VSS, without regard to current limiting. When driving from potentials greater than VDD(B) or less than VSS, the current at each input must be limited to 10 mA. It operates over a recommended VDD power supply range of 3 V to 15 V referenced to VSS (usually ground). Unused inputs must be connected to VDD, VSS, or another input. 2.

Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Institutional. Participants: 32 national-ranked junior swimmers, 100 m freestyle time (mean (SD), 60. 68 s (4. 81)). Main outcome measurements: Screened clinical strength, kinematic movements, and bilateral hand-force were measured. Asymmetry {{was defined as a}} percentage difference greater than 10 percent, either left (negative) or right (positive) for all variables. Results: Asymmetry of the clinical strength measures was found in ∼ 85 % of swimmers. Athletes with symmetry of all clinical strength measures displayed symmetrical bilateral hand force production.

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{regression analysis}} is usually applied to homogeneous observations. However, {{there are several}} real situations where the observations are not homogeneous. In these cases, by utilizing the traditional regression, we have a loss of performance in fitting terms. Then, for improving the goodness of fit, {{it is more suitable}} to apply the so-called clusterwise regression analysis. The aim of clusterwise linear regression analysis is to embed the techniques of clustering into regression analysis. In this way, the clustering methods are utilized for overcoming the heterogeneity problem in regression analysis. Furthermore, by integrating cluster analysis into the regression framework, the regression parameters (regression analysis) and membership degrees (cluster analysis) can be estimated simultaneously by optimizing one single objective function. In this paper the clusterwise linear regression has been analyzed in a fuzzy framework. In particular, a fuzzy clusterwise linear regression model (FCWLR model) with <b>symmetrical</b> fuzzy <b>output</b> and crisp input variables for performing fuzzy cluster analysis within a fuzzy linear regression framework is suggested. For measuring the goodness of fit of the suggested FCWLR model with fuzzy output, a fitting index is proposed.

40|$|Abstract:- Novel {{frequency}} doubler circuits and dividers for clock signal generation are presented. In combination with two edge detectors and two duty cycle control buffers a low cost {{frequency doubler}} circuit is achieved {{as compared to}} Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) design. An input clock signal with an unpredictable duty cycle is inputted to a rising (or falling) edge detector. The edge detector converts the positive (or negative) transitions to a one shot pulse train whose frequency {{is the same as}} that of the input clock. However, the one shot pulse train has its duty cycle far less than 50 %. By a first 50 % duty cycle control buffer the output waveform of the resulted clock signal is <b>symmetrical.</b> The <b>output</b> of the first-stage duty cycle buffer is then edge detected by a rising and falling edge detector, so that the resulted one shot pulse train has twice the frequency of the incoming 50 % duty cycle signal. Finally, the second one shot signals are duty cycle adjusted in the second-stage duty cycle control buffer, to restore its 50 % duty cycle. Therefore, two times frequency multiplication is achieved with low cost as compared to Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) design. Furthermore, a novel design approach for frequency dividers using duty cycle control circuit is also demonstrated. Simulation results for both frequency multiplication and division confirm the validity of the proposed design approach...|$|R

40|$|The spinal {{circuitry}} {{underlying the}} generation of basic locomotor synergies has been described in substantial detail in lampreys and the cellular mechanisms have been identified. The initiation of locomotion, on the other hand, relies on supraspinal networks and the cellular mechanisms involved {{are only beginning to}} be understood. This review examines some of the findings relative to the neural mechanisms involved in the initiation of locomotion of lampreys. Locomotion can be elicited by sensory stimulation or by internal cues associated with fundamental needs of the animal such as food seeking, exploration, and mating. We have described mechanisms by which escape swimming is elicited in lampreys in response to mechanical skin stimulation. A rather simple neural connectivity is involved, including sensory and relay neurons, as well as the brainstem rhombencephalic reticulospinal cells, which act as command neurons. We have shown that reticulospinal cells have intrinsic membrane properties that allow them to transform a short duration sensory input into a long-lasting excitatory command that activates the spinal locomotor networks. These mechanisms constitute an important feature for the activation of escape swimming. Other sensory inputs can also elicit locomotion in lampreys. For instance, we have recently shown that olfactory signals evoke sustained depolarizations in reticulospinal neurons and chemical activation of the olfactory bulbs with local injections of glutamate induces fictive locomotion. The mechanisms by which internal cues initiate locomotion are less understood. Our research has focused on one particular locomotor center in the brainstem, the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR). The MLR is believed to channel inputs from many brain regions to generate goal-directed locomotion. It activates reticulospinal cells to elicit locomotor output in a graded fashion contrary to escape locomotor bouts, which are all-or-none. MLR inputs to reticulospinal cells use both glutamatergic and cholinergic transmission; nicotinic receptors on reticulospinal cells are involved. MLR excitatory inputs to reticulospinal cells in the middle (MRRN) are larger than those in the posterior rhombencephalic reticular nucleus (PRRN). Moreover at low stimulation strength, reticulospinal cells in the MRRN are activated first, whereas those in the PRRN require stronger stimulation strengths. The output from the MLR on one side activates reticulospinal neurons on both sides in a highly symmetrical fashion. This could account for the <b>symmetrical</b> bilateral locomotor <b>output</b> evoked during unilateral stimulation of the MLR in all animal species tested to date. Interestingly, muscarinic receptor activation reduces sensory inputs to reticulospinal neurons and, under natural conditions, the activation of MLR cholinergic neurons will likely reduce sensory inflow. Moreover, exposing the brainstem to muscarinic agonists generates sustained recurring depolarizations in reticulospinal neurons through pre-reticular effects. Cells in the caudal half of the rhombencephalon appear to be involved and we propose that the activation of these muscarinoceptive cells could provide additional excitation to reticulospinal cells when the MLR is activated under natural conditions. One important question relates to sources of inputs to the MLR. We found that substance P excites the MLR, whereas GABA inputs tonically maintain the MLR inhibited and removal of this inhibition initiates locomotion. Other locomotor centers exist such as a region in the ventral thalamus projecting directly to reticulospinal cells. This region, referred to as the diencephalic locomotor region, receives inputs from several areas in the forebrain and is likely important for goal-directed locomotion. In summary, this review focuses on the most recent findings relative to initiation of lamprey locomotion in response to sensory and internal cues in lampreys...|$|R
