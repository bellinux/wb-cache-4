5|$|Cannon {{recovered}} from the sea are often extensively damaged from exposure to salt water; because of this, electrolytic reduction treatment is required to forestall the process of corrosion. The cannon is then washed in deionized water to remove the electrolyte, and is treated in tannic acid, which prevents further rust and gives the metal a bluish-black colour. After this process, cannons on display may be protected from oxygen and moisture by a wax <b>sealant.</b> A coat of polyurethane may also be painted over the wax <b>sealant,</b> to prevent the wax-coated cannon from attracting dust in outdoor displays.|$|E
5|$|The tegula (Greek solenes) was a plain flat tile, or a flat tile with raised edges, {{which was}} laid flat upon the roof, while the imbrex (Greek kalupter) was a semi-cylindrical roofing tile, like a half-pipe, laid over the joints between the tegulae. When well-made and {{properly}} imbricated (overlapped), {{there was little}} need for further waterproofing or <b>sealant.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most {{researchers}} have {{disagreed with the}} identification of the structures as collagen or other structural fibres. Notably, the team of scientists that reported the presence of pigmentation cells in the structures argued that their presence proved the structures were feathers, not collagen, because collagen does not contain pigment. Gregory S. Paul reidentified what the collagen hypothesis's proponents consider a body outline outside of the fibres as an artefact of preparation: breakage and brushed-on <b>sealant</b> have been misidentified as the outline of the body.|$|E

5|$|Lithium {{reacts with}} water easily, but with noticeably less vigor than other alkali metals. The {{reaction}} forms hydrogen gas and lithium hydroxide in aqueous solution. Because of its reactivity with water, lithium is usually {{stored in a}} hydrocarbon <b>sealant,</b> often petroleum jelly. Though the heavier alkali metals {{can be stored in}} more dense substances, such as mineral oil, lithium is not dense enough to be fully submerged in these liquids. In moist air, lithium rapidly tarnishes to form a black coating of lithium hydroxide (LiOH and LiOH·H2O), lithium nitride (Li3N) and lithium carbonate (Li2CO3, the result of a secondary reaction between LiOH and CO2).|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} {{cockatoo}} can be serious agricultural pests. They are sometimes controlled by shooting, poisoning or capture followed by gassing. Non-lethal damage mitigation methods used include scaring, habitat manipulation {{and the provision}} of decoy food dumps or sacrifice crops to distract them from the main crop. They can be a nuisance in urban areas due to destruction of property. They maintain their bills in the wild by chewing on wood but, in suburbia, they may chew outdoor furniture, door and window frames; soft decorative timbers such as western red cedar are readily demolished. Birds may also target external wiring and fixtures such as solar water heaters, television antennae and satellite dishes. A business in central Melbourne suffered as sulphur-crested cockatoos repeatedly stripped the silicone <b>sealant</b> from the plate glass windows. Galahs and red-tailed black cockatoos have stripped electrical cabling in rural areas and tarpaulin is targeted elsewhere. Outside Australia, the Tanimbar corella is a pest on Yamdena Island where it raids maize crops.|$|E
5|$|At {{an early}} stage, CART {{encountered}} problems {{in promoting the}} race. They were unable to adequately educate British motor racing fans about the series. Rockingham's owners attempted to display an advertisement at the 2001 British Grand Prix but the owner of Formula One's commercial rights Bernie Ecclestone cancelled the plan shortly before {{it was due to}} occur. A major marketing strategy took place in response. The advertising, headed by the Michaelides & Bednash agency, began in August in the printed press, and also included two television advertisements and an official poster. The event was affected by drainage problems on the new track which caused the practice sessions to be cancelled. The starting order was set according to the drivers' positions in the points' standings. Its distance was reduced from 210 to 140 laps and was won by Team Penske driver Gil de Ferran after overtaking pole position starter Kenny Bräck on the race's final lap. Most drivers praised the circuit but did not criticise the problem that affected it. Despite two days of practice and qualifying rounds being cancelled because of the drainage issues, 38,000 spectators watched the race. The track later had an extra layer added along with a <b>sealant</b> to allow it to drain water.|$|E
50|$|Curtain {{walls and}} {{perimeter}} <b>sealants</b> require maintenance to maximize service life.

50|$|The main {{difference}} between adhesives and <b>sealants</b> is that <b>sealants</b> typically have lower strength and higher elongation than adhesives do. When <b>sealants</b> are used between substrates having different thermal coefficients of expansion or differing elongation under stress, {{they need to}} have adequate flexibility and elongation. <b>Sealants</b> generally contain inert filler material and are usually formulated with an elastomer to give the required flexibility and elongation. They usually have a paste consistency to allow filling of gaps between substrates. Low shrinkage after application is often required. Many adhesive technologies can be formulated into <b>sealants.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Sealants</b> are a {{successful}} tool in caries prevention, but {{their role in}} preventive strategies after the caries decline has to be discussed. A survey of paediatric departments across Europe revealed that indications for pit and fissure <b>sealants</b> vary considerably, both nationally and internationally. Evidence for effectiveness of <b>sealants</b> in controlling caries in posterior teeth implies that <b>sealants</b> should be an integrated part of management of pit and fissure caries. Still, the indication for occlusal <b>sealants</b> seems to be shifting from primary prevention to a therapeutic decision for caries management of lesions in enamel and the outer part of the dentine. <b>Sealants</b> are also an interesting concept for caries management in approximal surfaces. Clinical trials suggest that novel techniques of sealing or infiltrating approximal lesions show promise. However, approximal sealing techniques are as complex to apply and time-consuming as approximal fillings. The article proposes guidelines for teaching {{on the use of}} <b>sealants...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{postal survey}} {{was to assess the}} utilization, {{knowledge}} and attitude concerning <b>sealants</b> among Malaysian dentists. A pretested questionnaire was sent to all dentists (1217) who were on the Dentist Register of Malaysia of 1987. A response rate of 61. 1 % was obtained. The results indicate that 52. 6 % of the respondents have used <b>sealants,</b> but of these only 13. 6 % have used them frequently. The two "knowledge" related questions receiving the most support concerned the suitability of the first permanent molars for <b>sealants</b> and the loss of <b>sealants</b> attributable to problems at the time of application. The two "attitudinal" questions receiving the most support concerned the value of <b>sealants</b> in preventing dental caries and the need for the profession to expand more efforts toward increasing public demand for <b>sealants.</b> Only about 50 % of the respondents believed that <b>sealants</b> are cost-effective.

40|$|Objectives: The {{introduction}} of fluoride releasing <b>sealants</b> and glass ionomer cements as fissure <b>sealants</b> adds another dimension to prevention of pit and fissure caries. The ability of resin <b>sealants</b> and glass ionomer cements to release fluoride {{on a long}} term basis to the sealed enamel and the adjacent unsealed pit and fissure and cuspal in - cline enamel may allow for further reduction in pit and fissure caries experience for children. Hence, {{the study was conducted}} to compare the amount of fluoride release in the plaque after placing fluoride releasing pit and fissure <b>sealants</b> and glass ionomer fissure <b>sealants</b> used in Atraumatic Restorative Treatment (ART) approach. To compare the fluoride release of both the materials at the different time intervals. Material and Methods: A total of 60 school going children were included in this study. Before application of the <b>sealants,</b> baseline plaque fluoride levels were estimated from all the study subjects. After application of <b>sealants</b> again the same was estimated at an interval of 24 hour, 9 days, 2 weeks and 4 weeks. Results: The peak plaque fluoride levels were achieved at 24 hours after application of fissure <b>sealants</b> in all the groups. Conclusions: Within the limitation of the study, the present study indicated that fluoride releasing fissure <b>sealants</b> may act as a source of fluoride in plaque which will help in preventing pit and fissure and smooth surface caries in the tooth sealed with fissure <b>sealants...</b>|$|R

25|$|An {{adhesive}} <b>sealant</b> (polyisobutylene) {{is applied}} to the face of the spacer on each side and the panes pressed against the spacer. If the unit is gas filled, two holes are drilled into the spacer of the assembled unit, lines are attached to draw out the air out of the space and replacing it (or leaving just vacuum) with the desired gas. The lines are then removed and holes sealed to contain the gas. The more modern technique is to use an online gas filler, which eliminates the need to drill holes in the spacer. The units are then sealed on the edge side using either polysulfide or silicone <b>sealant</b> or similar material to prevent humid outside air from entering the unit. The desiccant will remove traces of humidity from the air space so that no water appears on the inside faces (no condensation) of the glass panes facing the air space during cold weather. Some manufacturers have developed specific processes that combine the spacer and desiccant into a single step application system.|$|E
50|$|Dental <b>sealants</b> (also termed pit and fissure <b>sealants,</b> {{or simply}} fissure <b>sealants)</b> are a dental {{treatment}} {{intended to prevent}} tooth decay. Teeth have recesses on their biting surfaces; the back teeth have fissures (grooves) and some front teeth have cingulum pits. It is these pits and fissures which are most vulnerable to tooth decay, partly because food sticks in them and they are hard-to-clean areas. Dental <b>sealants</b> are materials placed in these pits and fissures to fill them in, creating a smooth surface that is easy to clean. Dental <b>sealants</b> are mainly used in children who are at higher risk of tooth decay, and typically they are placed {{as soon as the}} adult molar teeth come through.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: This study's {{purpose was}} to {{evaluate}} the effect of light curing methods on the microleakage and microhardness of <b>sealants.</b> METHODS: The Elipar Free Light 2 light emitting diode (LED) with 10 - and 20 -second curing times, and the Elipar 2500 halogen light with a 20 -second curing time were compared. Four different <b>sealants</b> were used: (1) Delton Clear; (2) Delton Opaque; (3) UltraSeal XT Clear; and (4) UltraSeal XT Opaque. Specimens were fabricated in a silicone mold (2 -mm thick) and cured. Knoop hardness was measured {{at the bottom and}} top surfaces. For the microleakage evaluation, 120 human molars were divided into 12 groups and sealed with the <b>sealants</b> and curing methods, as stated previously. The teeth were thermocycled and immersed in 2 % methylene blue for 24 hours. Each tooth was sectioned and examined for dye penetration. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in the microleakage of <b>sealants</b> polymerized by either the halogen or LED curing methods. The microhardness of <b>sealants</b> varied according to the type of material and curing method. CONCLUSIONS: A 10 -second polymerization time with light emitting diodes was not sufficient to cure the 2 -mm-thick opaque or high filler loaded <b>sealants.</b> Decreasing the curing time, however, had no effect on the microleakage of the <b>sealants...</b>|$|R
