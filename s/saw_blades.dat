5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} moissanite {{is found}} in only minute quantities in certain types of meteorite and in corundum deposits and kimberlite. Virtually all the silicon carbide sold in the world, including moissanite jewels, is synthetic. Natural moissanite was first found in 1893 as a small component of the Canyon Diablo meteorite in Arizona by Dr. Ferdinand Henri Moissan, after whom the material was named in 1905. Moissan's discovery of naturally occurring SiC was initially disputed because his sample may have been contaminated by silicon carbide <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> that were already on the market at that time.|$|E
5|$|Gasketball is a part-basketball, part-puzzler shot-matching sports {{video game}} where players flick {{basketballs}} through 2D physics puzzles (with flippers, portals, circular <b>saw</b> <b>blades,</b> and gravity switches) into a basketball hoop. Some puzzles include banking the basketball shot off multiple surfaces {{before making the}} basket. In the HORSE-style games, the player must match the exact setup of the opponent's shot, such as hitting the floor before entering the hoop. In the campaign, players get more points for making the shot without retrying, and have five attempts to make the hoop {{before moving to the}} next level shamefully. Players are awarded medals for the quality of their performance {{at the end of each}} chapter. Gold medals unlock new modes of play in the chapter. Every chapter has a unique theme, such as a construction site or outer space.|$|E
5|$|Super Meat Boy is a {{platform}} {{game in which}} players control a small, dark red, cube-shaped character named Meat Boy, who must save his cube-shaped, heavily bandaged girlfriend Bandage Girl from the evil scientist Dr. Fetus. The game is divided into chapters, which together contain over 300 levels. Players attempt to {{reach the end of}} each level, represented by Bandage Girl, while avoiding crumbling blocks, <b>saw</b> <b>blades,</b> and various other fatal obstacles. The player can jump and run on platforms, and can jump off or slide down walls. The core gameplay requires fine control and split-second timing, and was compared to, regarding both gameplay and level of difficulty, traditional platform games such as Super Mario Bros. and Ghosts 'n Goblins.|$|E
30|$|However, {{thermal stress}} is {{produced}} when circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> is working, because the temperature {{at the edge}} of the blade is higher than that in other regions of the blade. It will cause high tangential compressive stress on the edge of the circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade,</b> causing a buckling deformation that reduces cutting precision, increases kerf loss, and shortens the saw’s life [1, 2]. Thin circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> is more easily affected by thermal stress. For saving materials, the stability of <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> is very important, especially for thin circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade.</b>|$|R
30|$|In step 1, {{the roll}} moved slowly down and elastic–plastic {{deformation}} was produced to the <b>saw</b> <b>blade.</b> In step 2, the roll slowly raised and the <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> {{was no longer}} under any load. The residual stress of <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> was the tensioning stress.|$|R
30|$|When {{circular}} <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> {{is cutting}} the work piece, tangential and radial tensile stresses are produced {{because of the}} centrifugal force generated by the higher rotational speed of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade.</b> Meanwhile, thermal stress is produced because {{the temperature in the}} edge of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> is higher than other regions. The thermal stress will lead to a large tangential compressive stress in the edge of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> with the increase of temperature difference between the edge and center of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade,</b> which could cause the buckling deformation of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade,</b> reduction of cutting precision and machining quality of the surface, increase of kerf loss and shortening of saw life. The tensioning processes such as hammering, rolling and heating are proposed and applied {{in order to avoid the}} above-mentioned phenomenon. The tangential tensile tensioning stress field is produced during tensioning process in order to compensate the tangential compressive stress, which will improve the stability and quality of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> [1, 2]. Therefore, the tangential tensioning stress distribution after tensioning is the key factor that determines the quality of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{dominant}} {{industrial use}} of diamond is in cutting, drilling, grinding, and polishing. Most of these applications {{do not require}} large diamonds; in fact, most diamonds of gem-quality except for their small size can be used industrially. Diamonds are embedded in drill tips or <b>saw</b> <b>blades,</b> or ground into a powder for use in grinding and polishing applications. Specialized applications include use in laboratories as containment for high pressure experiments (see diamond anvil cell), high-performance bearings, and limited use in specialized windows. With the continuing advances {{in the production of}} synthetic diamonds, new applications are becoming feasible. Garnering much excitement is the possible use of diamond as a semiconductor suitable for microchips, and because of its exceptional heat conductance property, as a heat sink in electronics.|$|E

25|$|Brigadier Dudley Clarke, {{the head}} of the 'A' Force {{deception}} department, recruited Maskelyne to work for MI9 in Cairo. He created small devices intended to assist soldiers to escape if captured and lectured on escape techniques.

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  4, the {{tensioning}} stress {{distribution of the}} circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> calculated by the FEM model followed the same trend as previous research results [2, 6, 18]. The values of tensioning stress of the circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> calculated by the FEM model and the measured results in radial path of the circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> were similar in most regions. The results mentioned above demonstrated that the tensioning stress of the circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> calculated by the model in this paper was true and reliable. The tensioning stress distribution of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> after roll tensioning process was the key analysis object in the following.|$|R
50|$|It {{commonly}} {{consists of}} two hydraulic clamping cylinders which clamp the material {{on both sides of}} the <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> horizontally, vertically, or angularly. In order to improve the life of the <b>saw</b> <b>blade,</b> the material is separated from the blade on both sides before the <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> is retracted from the cut.|$|R
30|$|For {{tangential}} tensioning stress, the tangential tensioning stress {{difference between}} {{outer edge of}} the <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> and rolled region was increased with yield strength when circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> was under the same deformation, which meant that the tensioning effect was improved with the increase of yield strength, because the greater tangential tensioning stress difference between edge of the <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> and rolled region meant that the circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> could maintain stability during large temperature differences when it was at work.|$|R

25|$|On September 7, 1887, Bogan {{was convicted}} of murder, and sentenced to death. However, Bogan still had several friends in cowboy circles, namely Tom Hall, whom famed Old West detective Charlie Siringo would later {{identify}} as having actually been Tom Nicholls, a murderer from the Texas Panhandle. Hall paid professional safecracker James Jones to commit a minor crime in Cheyenne, and to allow himself to be captured, thus being placed in jail with Bogan. Concealed in his shoes Jones had <b>saw</b> <b>blades,</b> which he and Bogan used to saw through the bars and make an escape on October 4, 1887. Joined by fellow prisoners Charles H. LeRoy and Bill Steary, both horse thieves, they made their escape through a ventilator and onto the roof. Within hours a posse was organised {{in one of the}} largest manhunts in Wyoming history.|$|E
500|$|The dabber {{variation}} {{is used to}} precisely place weld metal on thin edges. [...] The automatic process replicates the motions of manual welding by feeding a cold or hot filler wire into the weld area and dabbing (or oscillating) it into the welding arc. [...] It {{can be used in}} conjunction with pulsed current, and is used to weld a variety of alloys, including titanium, nickel, and tool steels. [...] Common applications include rebuilding seals in jet engines and building up <b>saw</b> <b>blades,</b> milling cutters, drill bits, and mower blades.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, a 2 -D and 3 -D {{finite element}} model of roll {{tensioning}} process of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> were established by Static/General module of ABAQUS software based on finite element method. The rolling force and tensioning stress distribution of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> were calculated by these two models which were proved to be true and reliable. The effects of yield strength of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> on tensioning stress distribution and rolling force were studied. The research achievements showed that a circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> made with high yield strength obtained a higher tangential compressive stress and radial compressive stress in the rolled region during roll tensioning process, which has both advantages and disadvantages for {{the stability of the}} <b>saw</b> <b>blade.</b> Besides, a circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> made with high yield strength also put forward higher requirements for roll tensioning equipment because of the large rolling force during roll tensioning process.|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  11, the {{tangential}} tensioning stress distribution of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> after unloading and the measured results in specified radial path of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> {{had the same}} trend and the value was similar in most regions, which proved that the tangential tensioning stress of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> calculated by finite element method in this paper was true and reliable. In the edge area of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade,</b> the tangential tensioning stress was increased with the ratio of radius, and the feasibility of multi-spot pressure tensioning process was theoretically proved.|$|R
30|$|The multi-spot {{pressure}} tensioning {{process of}} circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> {{was built by}} dynamic/explicit solution module of ABAQUS in this paper. The tangential stress field of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> during loading process was calculated through the model. The linear elastic unloading process of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> with initial stress field calculated by the dynamic/explicit model was established by static/general solution module. The tangential tensioning stress of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> after unloading was finally obtained by the above-mentioned two models. Compared with the experimental results, the simulation result proved to be true and reliable.|$|R
500|$|Filming of {{the trap}} scenes, which was done last, began in March. The film's opening trap scene was filmed at Metro Hall in Toronto, Ontario, just outside Roy Thomson Hall, and {{included}} 400 extras. [...] In the trap, the circular <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> were actually real and functional, but safety precautions were taken for the actors. One actor {{that was in}} the trap, Jon Cor, told Demon FM that he had scars on his hands from the shackles, and said the other actors, Sebastian Pigott chipped his tooth and Anne Lee Greene lost the feeling in her feet and had to receive medical attention.|$|E
500|$|As {{the player}} progresses, the game's puzzles become more complex. Successive levels {{introduce}} new game mechanics and enemy types. Enemies {{take the form}} of deadly creatures such as snakes, lizards, and giant spiders. [...] Each enemy type has a specific movement pattern. Single-use items, such as spears, can be collected on levels and then used to dispatch enemies from a distance. Other mechanics include obstacles such as boulders, <b>saw</b> <b>blades,</b> and traps to avoid. The player can activate levers, which shift walls and platforms to open paths through the level. Lara Croft Go also features optional in-app purchases, which provide hints to the puzzles.|$|E
2500|$|A special {{grinding}} {{profile that}} is used to grind milling cutters and twist drills. [...] It is most common in non-machining areas, as sawfilers use saucer wheels in the maintenance of <b>saw</b> <b>blades.</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{simulation}} {{results showed that}} rolling force was increased linearly with yield strength of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade,</b> which brought challenges to the roll tensioning equipment of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Cold saws {{use either}} a solid {{high speed steel}} (HSS) or {{tungsten}} carbide-tipped, resharpenable circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade.</b> They are equipped {{with an electric motor}} and a gear reduction unit to reduce the <b>saw</b> <b>blade's</b> rotational speed while maintaining constant torque. This allows the HSS <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> to feed at a constant rate with a very high chip load per tooth.|$|R
30|$|However, for radial {{tensioning}} stress, the radial tensioning stress {{difference between}} inner {{edge of the}} <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> and rolled region was increased with yield strength when circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> was under the same deformation, which was not conducive to {{the improvement of the}} stability of the <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> because the stress state is easy for the blade to lose stability and buckle into a “dish” shape.|$|R
2500|$|The Peugeot {{family of}} Valentigney, Montbéliard, Franche-Comté, France, {{began in the}} {{manufacturing}} business in the 19th century. In 1842, they added production of coffee, pepper, and salt grinders. The company's entry into the vehicle market was by means of crinoline dresses, which used steel rods, leading to umbrella frames, <b>saw</b> <b>blades,</b> chisels, wire wheels, and bicycles. Armand Peugeot introduced his [...] "Le Grand Bi" [...] penny-farthing in 1882, along {{with a range of}} other bicycles. The car company and bike company parted ways in 1926 but Peugeot bicycles continued to be built until very recently.|$|E
2500|$|John Deere, a Vermont, [...] US blacksmith, {{noted that}} the {{ploughing}} of many sticky, non-sandy soils might benefit from modifications {{in the design of}} the mouldboard and in the metals used. He noted that a polished needle would enter leather and fabric with greater ease, and a polished pitchfork required less effort as well. In the pursuit of a polished and thus slicker surface for a plough, he experimented with portions of <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> and by 1837, he was making polished, cast steel ploughs. The energy effort required was lessened, which enabled the use of larger ploughs, making more effective use of horse power.|$|E
5000|$|If possible, diamond <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> {{should be}} used instead of {{abrasive}} <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> to cut. Diamond <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> normally cut more quickly than abrasive blades while requiring less water.|$|E
30|$|Tensioning is {{the most}} {{important}} and advanced technological process for production of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> for avoiding the above-mentioned phenomenon. Among all the tensioning processes, roll tensioning process is most widely applied in the cutting tool industry. The tangential tensile tensioning stress field is produced which can compensate for the tangential compressive stress caused by thermal stress and improve the stability of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> [3 – 5]. However, circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> can also obtain radial compressive tensioning stress during roll tensioning process which is easy for the blade to lose stability and buckle into a “dish” shape. The thin circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> requires higher tangential tensile tensioning stress and lower radial compressive tensioning stress for maintaining stability, which brings a challenge to roll tensioning process of thin circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Surgical site {{infection}} {{is a major}} potential complication of all operative interventions, and the diabetic foot is particularly at risk for bacterial recontamination and infectious sequelae. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify whether the sagittal <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> used during partial foot amputations and diabetic foot debridements carries the potential to serve as a bacterial fomite. We physically cultured the sagittal <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> during 20 foot debridements involving the resection of bone in patients diagnosed with a diabetic foot infection. The culture was taken after the initial debridement and during the irrigation phase of the procedure. We observed 16 positive routine intraoperative culture results, with positive <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> culture results in 15 (93. 8 %; 15 / 16) of these cases. In 14 (93. 3 %; 14 / 15) of these cases, the <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> culture grew at least one of the same bacteria as our other routine intraoperative cultures. We observed 4 negative routine intraoperative culture results, with negative <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> culture results in 3 (75. 0 %; 3 / 4) of these cases. This results in agreement between routine intraoperative cultures and <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> culture of 85. 0 % (17 / 20). The results of this investigation demonstrate that the sagittal <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> used for osseous resection during diabetic foot debridements and partial foot amputations carries the potential for intraoperative bacterial transmission. We recommend changing at least the sagittal <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> if more bone is resected following irrigation, particularly if it is used to obtain a “clean margin” for microbiological or histological examination...|$|R
50|$|A {{splitter}} is {{a stationary}} blade of similar thickness to the rotating <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> mounted behind it {{to prevent a}} board from pinching inward into the saw kerf and binding on the <b>saw</b> <b>blade,</b> potentially causing a dangerous kickback.

Blades with a narrow kerf relative to their body are more susceptible to grabbing and kickback.|$|R
50|$|Diamond: Fixed {{onto the}} saw blade's base to form diamond <b>saw</b> <b>blades.</b> As diamond is a superhard material, diamond <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> {{can be used}} to cut hard brittle or {{abrasive}} materials, for example, stone, concrete, asphalt, bricks, ceramics, glass, semiconductor and gem stone. There are many methods used to fix the diamonds onto the blades' base and there are various kinds of diamond <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> for different purposes. High speed steel (HSS): The whole saw blade is made of High Speed Steel (HSS). HSS <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> are mainly used to cut steel, copper, aluminum and other metal materials. If high-strength steels (e.g., stainless steel) are to be cut, the blades made of cobalt HSS (e.g. M35, M42) should be used.|$|E
50|$|Carbide-tipped saw blades: The saw blade's {{teeth are}} tipped (via welding) with {{small pieces of}} sharp {{tungsten}} carbide block. This type of blade is also called TCT (Tungsten Carbide-Tipped) saw blade. Carbide-tipped <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> are widely used to cut wood, plywood, laminated board, plastic, grass, aluminum and some other metals.Solid-carbide saw blades: The whole saw blade is made of tungsten carbide.

50|$|Cutting heads include {{circular}} <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> (chisel tooth or scratcher tooth), brush knives, grass blades, etc. Most brushcutters {{also allow}} other heads to be fitted, including bump feed and fixed line heads {{such as those}} used on line trimmers or modified <b>saw</b> <b>blades</b> such as a beaver blade which resembles a chainsaw.|$|E
30|$|The multi-spot {{pressure}} tensioning {{process of}} circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> {{was built by}} dynamic/explicit solution module of the finite element software called ABAQUS for avoiding non-convergence and improving the computational efficiency. The stress field of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> during loading process was calculated based on the finite element model. The model which could both meet the requirement of computational efficiency and accuracy was established by adjusting the step time and density of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade.</b> The unloading process of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> was built by static/general solution module of ABAQUS using the stress field of loading process calculated by dynamic/explicit finite element method as initial conditions. The tangential tensioning stress field of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> tensioned by multi-spot pressure which showed the same trend with the measured result was calculated based on the two above-mentioned models. A more ideal distribution of tangential tensioning stress could be produced by the multi-spot pressure tensioning process. The feasibility of multi-spot pressure tensioning process was theoretically proved in this paper.|$|R
30|$|The {{material}} {{model of}} circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> was set as linear strengthening elastic–plastic model (bilinear model) because the plastic deformation of circular <b>saw</b> <b>blade</b> during roll tensioning process was very little.
