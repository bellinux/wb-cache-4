Participants (n = 498) from northwest Arkansas public school string programs were given the String Student Music Preference Questionnaire (SSMPQ) developed by the author.

40|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that music listening influences individual affective responses. However, there is scant research examining how social factors might interact to influence subjective affective responses to music. This study investigates the effects of social feedback and social context on subjective affective responses to music. In a between-subjects experiment, participants (N = 120) listened to unfamiliar music from various genres either alone or with another participant. For each musical example, participants received positive and negative social feedback, derived from a pilot study, or factual album information. After listening to each musical example and reading the provided social feedback or album information, participants reported their subjective valence, arousal, subjective affective intensity, concentration, music liking and familiarity. There was no effect of social feedback on subjective valence responses. Positive and negative social feedback influenced subjective arousal responses positively and negatively, respectively. Subjective affective intensity was not influenced by social feedback. Social context did not influence subjective affective responses to the musical examples. Lower concentration was reported in <b>social</b> <b>listening</b> conditions compared to solitary conditions. Greater familiarity with the musical examples was reported when social feedback was provided. The findings {{of the present study}} suggest that social feedback can influence particular affective responses to, and familiarity with, music. However, <b>social</b> <b>listening</b> might reduce concentration, especially in the absence of social feedback. These findings highlight issues warranting consideration for how music is affectively experienced in everyday life, as well as purposely used in varied contexts...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that social factors can influence how people emotionally respond to music. This study investigated whether social feedback and the <b>social</b> <b>listening</b> context influenced subjective emotional responses to music. Emotional responses to unfamiliar music in a pilot study were used as social feedback in a subsequent 2 (social feedback: social feedback, no social feedback control) x 2 (listening context: alone, with a friend) between-subjects experimental study. Brisbane university students signed up to the study with a friend and were randomly allocated to complete the study together or alone in adjacent rooms. Participants listened to each music piece and reported their subjective valence, arousal and emotion intensity. Music preference, familiarity and task concentration were also reported in randomly allocated response booklets. The social feedback booklet contained positive and negative social feedback on valence and arousal for each music piece. The no social feedback response booklet contained unemotional, factual album information. Contrary to hypotheses, receiving positive and negative valence social feedback did not influence subjective ratings of valence. However, positive and negative arousal social feedback influenced arousal. The listening context did not influence subjective emotions. The predicted interactive effect of social feedback and listening context on emotional responses to music was not found. As hypothesised, less concentration was reported in <b>social</b> <b>listening</b> conditions compared to solitary conditions. Furthermore, as predicted, subjective liking of the music was consistent across conditions. However, when social feedback was provided, higher levels of music familiarity were reported. While the present study failed to support all hypotheses, the findings {{support the notion that}} social feedback can influence how people emotionally appraise and respond to music...|$|E

The paper discusses the concepts underlying such a model, the system implementing it, and two concrete examples: The Orchestra Explorer designed for the Museo degli Strumenti Musicali at Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia, Roma, Italy, and the interactive dance and music performance The Bow Is bent and Drawn (composer Nicola Ferrari), presented at Casa Paganini, Genova, Italy, in occasion of the opening concert of the 8 th Intl. Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME 08), June 4, 2008, and in museum interactive experiences at Festival della Scienza, Genova. This work is part of current research at Casa Paganini—InfoMus on embodied <b>social</b> active <b>listening</b> to sound and music content through the analysis and processing of expressiveness in human full-body movement and gesture. A user-centric interactive multimedia system architecture is proposed, operating on prerecorded music. From the perspective of valorization of cultural heritage, this research provides engaging paradigms of interaction with prerecorded music content, enabling a large number of nonexpert users to rediscover the musical heritage (e. g., classical and contemporary music) they may not be familiar with. Research was carried out in the framework of the EU-ICT Project SAME (Sound and Music for Everyone, Everyday, Everywhere, Every Way, www. sameproject. eu, 2008 – 2010) and has been recently extended to active experience of audiovisual content, and in particular to cultural heritage and museum scenarios: the novel interactive permanent museum exhibition Viaggiatori di Sguardo has been designed and developed at Palazzo Ducale, Genova, enabling visitors to explore virtually the UNESCO Heritage Palazzi dei Rolli in Genova...|$|R

30|$|SMA-tools (SMAT) can be {{described}} as “technology tools to implement <b>social</b> <b>listening</b> and measurements programs” [32] based on user-generated public content (such as postings, comments, conversations in online forums etc.) with different features like “reporting, dashboarding, visualization, search, event-driven alerting, and text mining”. Concerning governments, it must be assumed that currently, the majority of these feedback gathering mechanisms on social media are conducted manually by government officials; though evidence from on-going research projects suggests that there is a certain demand among governmental bodies for technologies that allow for automated and systematic SMA [3, 16]. The authors conclude that the deployment of SMAT will be rising also in the governmental sector in the near future. They point to the EU project “UniteEurope”, where it is “(…) local governments that show a major interest in applying a SMAT that allows collecting and analysing citizens’ statements on social media with regards to urban migrant integration” [3]. The project is going to be debated in more detail in section  4.|$|E

Sometimes the tweets or posts are lighthearted and positive; for example, recent tweets include “The unf library is the MVP of finals week!” and “Love spending time at the UNF Library”. Other times real concerns or complaints are voiced, allowing the library staff to reach out online and address as best they can. The act of listening has also allowed the Carpenter Library to begin fun and engaging conversations with students, which many times leads to that individual liking the library’s reply, retweeting/reposting, and often following the library account.
