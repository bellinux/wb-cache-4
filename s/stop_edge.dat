40|$|AbstractAnisotropic {{diffusion}} is {{used for}} both image enhancement and denoising. The Perona-Malik model makes use of anisotropic diffusion to filter out the noise. In Perona-Malik model the rate of diffusion is controlled by <b>edge</b> <b>stopping</b> function. The drawback of Perona-Malik model is that the sharp edges and fine details are not preserved well in the denoised image. But the sharp edges and fine details can be preserved well using appropriate <b>edge</b> <b>stopping</b> function. We have analysed the effect of different <b>edge</b> <b>stopping</b> functions in anisotropic diffusion {{in terms of how}} efficient they are in preserving edges. We have found that an <b>edge</b> <b>stopping</b> function which stops diffusion from low image gradient onwards well preserves the sharp edges and fine details. This property of an <b>edge</b> <b>stopping</b> function will also result in lower evolution in case of level set methods. But an <b>edge</b> <b>stopping</b> function which stops diffusion from high image gradient onwards will not preserve sharp edges and fine details, since they are blurred due to diffusion. We have also found that low values of gradient threshold parameter used in <b>edge</b> <b>stopping</b> function well preserves the sharp edges and fine details than high values of threshold parameter. By utilizing an <b>edge</b> <b>stopping</b> function which stops diffusion from low image gradient onwards or which has zero or insignificant value at low image gradient, we can well preserve the sharp edges and fine details in the denoised image...|$|R

30|$|As seen in Figure  6, the {{response}} of the diffusion coefficient varies with the different threshold values. The response is more sensitive when the threshold value is low with respect to the same gradient s. High value of the coefficient yields a high diffusivity for the corresponding pixel in the image which leads to blurring effect. As mentioned earlier, existing techniques only used a single <b>edge</b> <b>stopping</b> threshold value for the whole image. In this study, an adaptive <b>edge</b> <b>stopping</b> threshold function given in Equation  8 is used.

The two-field long-wavelength micropolar model and its gradient and four-field generalizations are obtained and {{compared to the}} single-field conventional and gradient micropolar models. The single-field models {{can be applied to}} the analysis of long-wavelength deformations, but it does not describe short-wavelength waves and boundary effects. It is demonstrated that the two-field models describe both long-wavelength and short-wavelength harmonic waves and localized deformations and may be used in order to find <b>stop</b> band <b>edges</b> and to study the filtering properties of the interface. The two-field models make it possible to describe not only exponential but also short-wavelength boundary effects and evaluate degree of its spatial localization.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a numerical study of diffraction {{effects in the}} AIRES optical system using GLAD by Applied Optics Research. AIRES (or Airborne Infrared Echelle Spectrometer) employs two gratings in series. The small, first-order (i. e., predisperser) grating sorts orders for the large, high-order echelle grating, thus providing moderately high spectral resolution over 3. 6 octaves in wavelength. The AIRES' optical design includes three field stops (i. e., a circular aperture and two long, narrow slits) and four pupil stops. A detailed diffraction analysis is required to evaluate critical trade-offs between spectral resolution, optical throughput, detector background, scattered light, and system size and weight. Such an analysis must consider diffraction effects at the pupil <b>stops</b> (<b>edge</b> diffraction), at the field stops (spatial filtering), and at intermediate positions where other optical elements are located. The effects of slit width, slit length, oversizing of the second slit relative to the first, baffling at the Lyot stop and subsequent pupil stops, and the necessity for oversizing other optical elements are presented and discussed. It is found that for narrow slits, the downstream energy distribution is significantly broadened relative to that for large slits, where telescope diffraction dominates, leading to significantly more light loss than anticipated, unless other key optical elements are oversized. The importance of performing a proper diffraction analysis is emphasized and the suitability of GLAD for this task is discussed...|$|R

They used a method called the Barycentric form of Lagrange interpolation, which was very robust.|$|R
