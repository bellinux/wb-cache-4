50|$|Some <b>smaller</b> <b>CRAs,</b> {{including}} Egan-Jones (the only NRSRO to do so), use a subscription-based {{business model}} whereby ratings {{are not made}} public but are available only to subscribers, who pay a monthly fee for access to credit rating information. These <b>smaller</b> <b>CRAs</b> argue that such a business model makes them less reliant on the good will of the issuers they rate, thereby eliminating one major potential conflict of interest.|$|R

40|$|In this article, {{the role}} of credit rating {{agencies}} (CRAs) during the 2010 – 11 EU sovereign debt crisis is assessed. It is concluded that rating agencies lag behind markets, that their business model is flawed, and {{that the lack of}} competition renders the big three CRAs with too strong a market position. The reliance on CRAs should be reduced by attaching less importance to them in prudential regulation and accounting standards. At the same time, more competition and transparency is needed to increase the quality of ratings. Finally, several policy options to change the ratings industry are discussed, including the creation of a network of <b>small</b> <b>CRAs,</b> delegation of sovereign debt ratings to the European Central Bank or the creation of a European rating agency...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} agent {{problem is}} one of the major issues of the credit rating agency market. Is it possible to solve the prevailing incentive problem of the market and contemporaneously satisfy the reputation demand of the investors? This paper presents an option for regulating the credit rating agency market more effectively. The market shall be coordinated through a central allocation office, which is acting as a mediator between both contractual parties. The paper develops a game theoretical approach that considers reputation as one of the most important aspects within the market. After analysing the status quo two policy options are discussed on a game theoretical basis. The main result is that the incorporation of a mediator, which awards the contracts based on a lottery drawing, would help to solve conflicts of interests. The incentive to inflate ratings decreases significantly. Moreover, rating shopping option becomes impossible. Two possible positive side effects for <b>smaller</b> <b>CRAs</b> and new incumbents are the increase of market share as well as reputation. Therefore, the market competition should be affected positively, too...|$|R
5000|$|Many private users (pension funds, banks) of ratings data now {{demand that}} ratings be from an NRSRO. Consequently, {{there is some}} debate that, by [...] "recognizing" [...] certain CRAs, the SEC has {{bestowed}} a competitive advantage on them. This view {{is supported by the}} vigor by which many non-NRSRO CRAs seek NRSRO recognition. On the other hand, historically, many private users of ratings data have [...] "defaulted" [...] to Standard & Poor's and Moody's when specifying which ratings must be used for their own purposes. (S&P and Moody's are the oldest, most widely respected, and by far the largest of the CRAs.) Accordingly, it is conceivable that the NRSRO designation has actually increased competition in the industry by providing an unintended government [...] "seal of approval" [...] on certain <b>smaller</b> <b>CRAs</b> (such as Fitch Ratings, DBRS, Kroll Bond Rating Agency, A.M. Best and Egan-Jones). If true, this, of course, {{raises the question of whether}} this is something the government should do, and whether the NRSRO recognition process is the best mechanism to achieve this goal.|$|R
40|$|Metallurgically bonded CLAD pipes {{consist of}} a thick carbon steel bulk and {{a thin layer of}} a {{corrosive}} resistant alloy (CRA). In order to perform a girth weld of such pipes, the clad layers of both parts must geometrically fit to each other. Thus, the field weldability of CLAD pipes are to a large extent determined by dimensional tolerances of pipe ends, which have to be <b>smaller</b> than <b>CRA</b> thickness, typically 3 mm. To ensure such tight tolerances, EBK has developed and installed a new calibration machine called Impander and corresponding cold sizing technology, in which the pipes are compressed (impanded) from outside. Thus, the traditional JCO manufacturing process is supplemented by a Compression step, which leads to the abbreviation JCOC. In contrast to an expander, the Impader tools operate from the pipe outside an...|$|R

The SR&ED program produces less of an incentive as firms grow, since the maximum benefit any single firm can receive from the program is fixed, and not proportional to firm size.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Public key {{cryptography}} {{often involves}} modular multiplication of large operands (160 up to 2048 bits). Several researchers have proposed iterative algorithms whose internal data are carry-save numbers. This number system is unfortunately not {{well suited to}} today’s Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) embedding dedicated carry logic. We propose to perform modular multiplication in a high-radix carry-save number system, where the sum bit of the well-known carry-save representation {{is replaced by a}} sum word. Two digits are then added by means of a <b>small</b> Carry-Ripple Adder (<b>CRA).</b> The originality of our approach is to analyze the modulus in order to select the most efficient high-radix carry-save representation.

40|$|Abstract — Since {{redundant}} number systems allow constant time addition, {{they are}} often {{at the heart of}} modular multipliers designed for public key cryptography (PKC) applications. Indeed, PKC involves large operands (160 to 1024 bits) and several researchers proposed carry-save or borrow-save algorithms.

40|$|Study of the Hypothalmus-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis {{has allowed}} for a greater {{understanding}} of the neurobiological systems that control the adaptive hormonal response to stress. In order to investigate the effect of diet, work, professional experience and sleep on HPA reactivity in healthy populations, data on the cortisol response to awakening (CRA), an indicator of HPA reactivity, was collected along with a suite of psychological metrics and survey instruments. A six-week voyage of work and study aboard an oceangoing sailing vessel was selected as a model for prolonged stressors, providing opportunities for both response and adaptation to novel and challenging conditions. Baseline data were collected on shore prior to boarding. Results confirmed that CRA profiles among all subjects were altered by the experience of seafaring, and that inexperienced students’ profiles were altered differently from those of professional crew. Students exhibited larger CRAs on shoreside working days than on shoreside weekend days. Working days at sea were marked by intermediate CRAs in the student samples, and CRAs for shore-leave days fell between atsea working day and onshore weekend levels. In contrast, professional crew exhibited increasing CRAs {{over the course of the}} voyage. Profiles for experienced scientific staff did not differ from those of inexperienced students. Also, greater reported meat consumption predicted <b>smaller</b> weekend <b>CRA</b> and lower subjective stress. This is the first study to examine CRA, diet and experience in the context of seafaring...|$|R
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of recent revisions to the regulations that implement the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), new information is now publicly available on the geographic distribution of small loans to businesses and farms and on community development lending. Because small businesses and small farms {{are more likely than}} larger ones to borrow <b>small</b> amounts, the <b>CRA</b> data on <b>small</b> loans are likely to provide a reasonable measure of the extension of credit to such businesses. Thus, the CRA data provide new opportunities to gauge the flow of credit to communities with differing economic and demographic characteristics. This article presents an initial assessment of the new CRA data on originations and purchases of small business and small farm loans during 1996. The focus of the analysis is on the broad patterns that emerge when the data are reviewed from a national perspective rather than on the lending activities of any individual institution.
