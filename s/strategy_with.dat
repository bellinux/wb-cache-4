5|$|In 1913, Ernst Zermelo used chess as a {{basis for}} his theory of game strategies, which is {{considered}} as one of the predecessors of game theory. Zermelo's theorem states {{that it is possible to}} solve chess, i.e. to determine with certainty the outcome of a perfectly played game (either white can force a win, or black can force a win, or both sides can force at least a draw). However, according to Claude Shannon, there are 1043 legal positions in chess, so it will take an impossibly long time to compute a perfect <b>strategy</b> <b>with</b> any feasible technology.|$|E

In 1987, Kohlberg left KKR to found a new private equity firm Kohlberg & Company. Kohlberg & Company returned to the investment style that Kohlberg had originally practiced at Bear Stearns and in KKR's earlier years, acquiring smaller, middle-market companies.|$|E
5|$|Peng {{was still}} in command of China's armed forces when Mao ordered the {{shelling}} of Jinmen (Quemoy) and Matsu, islands {{off the coast of}} Fujian that were still held by the Kuomintang, in the late summer and autumn of 1958. Peng developed a <b>strategy</b> <b>with</b> his Chief of Staff, Su Yu, to bombard the islands so intensely that the morale of their defenders would collapse, eventually leading to the islands' surrender. After the islands' surrender, the PLA would then use the islands to launch attacks against Taiwan. The saturated shelling of the islands included over half the artillery in China, and began on August 28. The attack included a coordinated effort to cut off the islands' air and sea supply lines.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the conflict resolution strategies that 9 - to 11 -year-old children use with friends and with parents and the interrelations between them. The study also aimed to find the relation between mothers 2 ̆ 7 and fathers 2 ̆ 7 conflict resolution <b>strategies</b> <b>with</b> children and children 2 ̆ 7 s conflict resolution <b>strategies</b> <b>with</b> friends. A third goal was to find out if interparental conflict resolution strategies as reported by parents, and children 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions of interparental conflict resolution strategies, were related to children 2 ̆ 7 s conflict resolution <b>strategies</b> <b>with</b> friends. Finally, children 2 ̆ 7 s emotions in conflict situations were examined and linked to children 2 ̆ 7 s conflict resolution strategies. Conflict resolution strategies were defined broadly on the assumption that children could use more than one strategy. ^ Sixty-one 9 - to 11 -year old children and their parents were interviewed individually using open-ended interviews. Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed and coded for conflict resolution strategies and emotions. ^ Most children reported using multiple <b>strategies</b> in conflicts <b>with</b> friends and parents. The first and the last strategy that participants reported using were used for the analyses. Children used a range of <b>strategies</b> <b>with</b> friends, predominantly disengagement, assertion, reasoning, and conventional strategies. More girls reported using disengagement with friends than did boys. Assertion, submission, and reasoning were the predominant <b>strategies</b> used <b>with</b> parents. Parents 2 ̆ 7 conflict resolution <b>strategies</b> <b>with</b> children were related to the conflict situation. No clear relations between children 2 ̆ 7 s conflict resolution <b>strategies</b> <b>with</b> friends and parents 2 ̆ 7 conflict resolution <b>strategies</b> <b>with</b> children were found, though there was some correspondence between mothers 2 ̆ 7 and children 2 ̆ 7 s use of assertion as the first, and reasoning as the last strategy. Sex differences in emotions during conflict with friends and with parents were found. No clear patterns emerged between emotions experienced during conflict and conflict resolution <b>strategies</b> <b>with</b> friends and parents. Findings are discussed in light of the narratives of the respondents. ...|$|R

5|$|At the {{strategic}} level the ARVN and the South Vietnamese government had both rallied after {{appearing on the}} verge of collapse and the communist threat against Saigon had subsided, yet additional troop increases were required if Westmoreland was to adopt a more offensive <b>strategy,</b> <b>with</b> US troop levels planned to rise from 210,000 in January 1966 to 327,000 by December 1966. The Australian government increased its own commitment to the ground war in March 1966, announcing the deployment of a two battalion brigade—the 1st Australian Task Force (1 ATF)—with armour, aviation, engineer and artillery support; in total 4,500 men. Additional Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) force elements would also be deployed and with all three services total Australian strength in Vietnam was planned to increase to 6,300 personnel. 1 RAR was subsequently replaced by 1 ATF which was allocated its own area of operations in Phuoc Tuy Province, thereby allowing the Australians to pursue operations more independently using their own counter-insurgency tactics and techniques. The task force arrived between April and June 1966, constructing a base at Nui Dat, while logistic arrangements were provided by the 1st Australian Logistic Support Group which was established at the port of Vung Tau.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{was again}} fastest {{in the second}} {{practice}} on Friday afternoon, while Rosberg was unable to partake due to a water leak on his car. Hamilton's time of 1:31.660 was over three-tenths of a second faster than that of second places Daniel Ricciardo. Fellow Red Bull driver Max Verstappen was third, ahead of Vettel, all within one second of the fastest time. Ferrari split their practice <b>strategy,</b> <b>with</b> Kimi Räikkönen running the hard-compound tyre early in the session, while Vettel used the softer medium compound, before both switched to the soft tyres. At their home race, McLaren had a mixed session. While Fernando Alonso placed a good sixth, teammate Jenson Button had {{to take to the}} garage for repairs twice, before coming out on track again late in the session, eventually setting the ninth fastest time. Daniil Kvyat was 13th fastest, but damaged his front wing when he went over a kerb at Club corner.|$|E
5|$|In a {{match between}} the Australians and Nottinghamshire, Voce, {{one of the}} bodyline {{practitioners}} of 1932–33, employed the <b>strategy</b> <b>with</b> the wicket-keeper standing to the leg side and took 8/66. In the second innings, Voce repeated the tactic late in the day, in fading light against Woodfull and Bill Brown. Of his 12 balls, 11 were no lower than head height. Woodfull told the Nottinghamshire administrators that, if Voce's leg-side bowling was repeated, his men would leave the field and return to London. He further said that Australia would {{not return to the}} country in the future. The following day, Voce was absent, ostensibly due to a leg injury. Already angered by the absence of Larwood, the Nottinghamshire faithful heckled the Australians all day. Australia had previously and privately complained that some pacemen had strayed past the agreement in the Tests.|$|E

5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the internal difficulties of the Umayyad Caliphate that resulted from the civil wars of the 740s and the subsequent Abbasid Revolution, the Byzantines under Emperor Constantine V (reigned 741–775) were able to regain the initiative on their eastern borders from the Arabs, and pursued an aggressive <b>strategy.</b> <b>With</b> the gradual consolidation of the Abbasid regime in the 760s and 770s, the situation became more balanced: the Arabs resumed their large-scale raids deep into Asia Minor, although the Byzantines were still capable of major counterstrikes. Thus in 778, the Byzantines, under Michael Lachanodrakon, seized the town of Germanikeia (Ma'rash), where they captured significant amounts of booty and took many Syrian Christians captive, and defeated an army sent against them by the Abbasid general Thumama ibn al-Walid. In the next year, the Byzantines took and razed the fortress city of Hadath, forcing Caliph al-Mahdi (r. 775–785) to replace the rather passive Thumama with the veteran al-Hasan ibn Qahtaba. Hasan led over 30,000 troops in an invasion of Byzantine territory, but the Byzantines offered no opposition and withdrew to well-fortified towns and refuges, until a lack of supplies forced Hasan to return home without achieving much.|$|E
5|$|An {{independent}} {{study by the}} French historian Bernard B. Fall determined that the US Navy transported around 310,000refugees. The French were credited with around 214,000airlifted refugees, 270,000seaborne refugees and 120,000 and 80,000 Vietnamese and French military evacuees respectively. During the US Navy voyages, 54 people died on board, and 111 babies were born. Fall believed that of the 109,000refugees who went south by their own means, a large number hitchhiked on southbound French transport vessels that were {{not related to the}} migration operation. Fall felt that the figures were likely to have been overestimated, due to immigration fraud. Some refugees would travel south and register themselves, before smuggling themselves onto vessels returning north for another shipment of humans. They would then return south and re-register to claim another aid package. Likewise, with instances of entire villages moving south, the authorities frequently did not explicitly count the number of villagers, but simply took the word of the village leaders. The chiefs would often inflate the population figures to claim more aid rations. The mass exodus did not disrupt the north largely because whole villages often emigrated, instead of half a village moving and leaving the remainder of the community in disarray. Fall estimated that around 120,000Viet Minh troops and their dependents went north. Most of these evacuations were attributed to Viet Minh military <b>strategy,</b> <b>with</b> some being ordered to stay behind in readiness for future guerrilla activities. The northward movement was facilitated by vessels leaving from assembly areas at Qui Nhơn and Cà Mau at the southernmost extremity of Vietnam. The voyages to North Vietnam were provided by empty French ships heading back north to fetch more southbound anti-communists, as well vessels from communist nations such as Poland. The Viet Minh also actively cultivated the Montagnard indigenous people of Vietnam, whose land in the Central Highlands was encroached upon by incoming northern settlers. The communists spread propaganda through broadcasts in tribal languages and infiltrated the highland areas. According {{to a study by the}} Michigan State University Group, some 6,000tribespeople went north with the communists, accompanied by some Viet Minh who had adopted the indigenous culture.|$|E
5|$|While the two Ferraris were delayed behind Hamilton, Alonso {{was pulling}} {{away at the}} front, setting fastest laps on laps seven and fifteen. On lap 12, Robert Kubica was {{the first man to}} pit for fuel and fresh tyres, however he {{reported}} traction control problems four laps later and lost places. Alonso had extended his lead over Hamilton to 15 seconds by the first round of pitstops. He had experienced radio problems before refuelling, but these were fixed during the stop. The Renaults were circulating in eighth and tenth by the pit stops, with Fisichella ahead of Kovalainen. Button {{was one of the few}} drivers who started on the slower harder tyre and was dropping down the field, as Takuma Sato passed the Briton. All of the front runners were on the same tyre <b>strategy,</b> <b>with</b> Räikkönen being the first front runner to pit. He found himself behind Fisichella as he exited. A short pit stop by Hamilton enabled him to come out of the pits ahead of the Renault, leaving a car between himself and Räikkönen during the pit window. Heidfeld's late stop on lap 22 helped him stay ahead of Massa. The top five positions remained unchanged, however Hamilton's different strategy enabled him to escape Räikkönen and close in on leader Alonso at a second per lap. Despite pitting on lap 20, he set the fastest lap of the race on lap 22 in 1:36.701.|$|E
