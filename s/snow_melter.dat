In addition, the complicated melting process means that snow melting vehicles have a much lower capacity than the equivalent plow or blower vehicle; the largest <b>snow</b> <b>melter</b> can remove 500 metric tons of snow per hour, compared to the 5,000 metric tons per hour capacity of any large snow blower.|$|E

50|$|Basic {{types of}} <b>snow</b> <b>melters</b> are mobile, semi-mobile and stationary. Mobile <b>snow</b> <b>melters</b> drive {{down a street}} or along a rail line {{collecting}} snow and melting it. These often have a holding tank so the melt-water can be discharged at a designated location. Semi-mobile units have wheels and are moved into position and then loaded with snow by another machine. Stationary snowmelt systems may be built into the ground.|$|R

50|$|A <b>snow</b> <b>melter</b> is a {{piece of}} snow removal {{equipment}} designed to melt snow using flame burners, hot water or both. The melt-water is discharged into a storm drain or onto the ground. Melting snow artificially helps keep roads, airport tarmacs and other surfaces clear and ready to use, and the technology is primarily employed in areas where trucking snow is not geographically or economically feasible. A built-in snowmelt system which melts the snow where it falls is another snow removal alternative.|$|E

500|$|<b>Snow</b> <b>melters</b> are in {{some ways}} more {{environmentally}} friendly than gritters, as they do not spray hazardous materials, and pollutants from the road surface can {{be separated from the}} meltwater and disposed of safely. In addition, because the snow is melted on board, the costs of transporting snow from the site are eliminated. [...] On the other hand, snow melting can require large amounts of energy, which has its own costs and environmental impact.|$|R

50|$|There are {{two main}} {{barriers}} to dumping snow, the cost and availability of land, and the cost and logistics of trucking snow. The dumping of snow into bodies of water is no longer allowed in many places for pollution reasons which leaves dumping the snow on land or melting the snow. The availability of land suitable for dumping is limited and in most urban areas, the cost of land is significant. For example, the average listing for property in New York City is over two million dollars. Suitable land for a snow dump may be distant requiring trucking the snow to the remote dump sites. Thus, melting snow on site by using an industrial <b>snow</b> <b>melter</b> may be more cost-effective than trucking it {{to a remote location}} for disposal.|$|E
40|$|Three snow vehicles, type KD 60, were {{successfully}} {{used by the}} traverse party of the 9 th JARE (Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition) which made a round trip along 43 °E in longitude from Syowa Station to the South Pole (direct distance : 5, 180 km) during a period from September 1968 to February 1969 (141 days). This paper deals {{with one of the}} vehicles, KD 605, which has an overall cab, 7. 2 ton in weight, and is equipped with a super-charged diesel engine. It is also provided with a navigation system, several berths for the crew and cooking space, <b>snow</b> <b>melter,</b> and some racks built in for installing observation and radio equipments. In addition, to endure the severe environment of low temperature (- 60 ℃) and high altitude of 4, 000 meters, special care was taken in selecting the materials and in making the inhabitants comfortable. The vehicle covered 5, 353 km within 110 days for driving and 31 days for camping, consuming 12, 068 litres in total of diesel fuel. The snow surface was relatively hard from Syowa Station to 75 °S. On the upward slope, drifting and blowing snow caused by katabatic wind was intense. In some areas the snow vehicle and sleds were stuck into soft snow accumulated by wind or due to the surface configuration. The highest area along the route was a plateau more than 3, 500 meters between 75 °S and 80 °S. Soft snow covers this plateau where the wind was very weak and the air temperature was below - 50 ℃. Snow vehicle tracks sank as deep as 30 cm into the snow and the fuel consumption rate rose as high as 3. 5 l/km. Stopping longer than 5 minutes caused the runner of sled to stick to the snow surface, so that starting without help became impossible. Sticking was more pronounced with the decrease of air temperature. On the high plateau, more than 3, 700 meteis in altitude, the exhausted gas became dark due to the shortage of air and the increasing resistance. As a result, apparent output lowering was accompanied by knocking sounds while the engine was driven at low to medium speed. In the terrain south of 80 °S, (except the soft snow-covered area near the pole), the air temperature was about - 30 ℃ and the snow condition was getting better. As the terrain was downward slope, all these conditions helped the party to have pleasant driving. On the return trip, the snow surface had crust due to the effect of solar radiation and wind packing. Since the pulling-load became smaller and the air temperature became higher, the party experienced remarkable trouble to drive...|$|E

50|$|Perlman's {{modernization}} of the Central's physical plant also included paring down four-track main line routes to double track with centralized traffic control. On January 16, 1957, {{he was the}} first to push the button at the Erie, Pennsylvania control center activating the world's longest stretch of electronically controlled railroad, at a cost of $6,238,460. Centralized traffic control enabled one operator each shift to control the trains between Erie and Cleveland, Ohio. while another operator each shift controlled train movement between Erie and Buffalo, New York. Crossovers were located an average of every seven miles. If a locomotive engineer missed a signal, the train would automatically stop, and could not be moved until the engineer complied with the signal indication. Even in blizzard conditions, the train dispatchers could start <b>snow</b> <b>melters</b> located miles away with the push of a button. Freight trains could be operated at 60 miles an hour and passenger trains could be operated at 79 miles an hour over the 163-mile stretch of double track. The two remaining segments of the former four-track main line were dismantled, saving the Central money in terms of both maintenance and taxes. With the opening of the Erie center in 1957, Perlman indicated the Central's entire New York-Chicago main line would be operated under centralized traffic control by 1963, and the company was already installing centralized traffic control between Buffalo and Syracuse, New York.|$|R
