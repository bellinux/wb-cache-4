40|$|AbstractOrganotin {{compounds}} are toxic {{and have}} long-term persistence in the environment. Consequently very low {{environmental quality standards}} are set internationally for tributyltin, the major of <b>substance</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> in water. The fulfilment of these regulatory demands has necessitated the development of highly sensitive and selective analytical techniques for the measurement of these compounds. These developments have been coupled with novel extraction and pre-concentration methods that {{have the potential to}} be used with automated on-line procedures. Quantification using isotopically enriched tin standards in mass spectrometric-based techniques have allowed for improvements in robustness and precision of analytical methods. In parallel to these laboratory techniques, there have also been enhancements in monitoring methods, particularly the use of passive samplers. This review gives an overview of organotin compounds in the aquatic environment and current trends for their analysis and monitoring within the context of meeting the statutory regulatory environmental standards for tributyltin...|$|E
40|$|The Compendium is {{intended}} to facilitate {{the implementation of the}} EFSA guidance for the safety assessment of botanicals and botanical preparations intended for use as food supplements. The Compendium aims at flagging plants or part of plants or compounds of possible concern for human heath naturally present in the listed botanicals and that therefore require specific attention while assessing the safety of the product(s) containing such botanical(s). For some botanicals in the compendium adverse (toxic) effect(s) are known even though the constituent(s) of concern are not elucidated in the literature. In some cases the whole genus was flagged because of the likely presence of substances of concern characteristic for the toxicity of that genus. The presence of a <b>substance</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> in a given botanical does not mean that this substance will also be present in the botanical preparation. This depends largely on the plant part used, as well as the preparation method. The Compendium contains also an “insufficient information” list regrouping botanicals that appear in one of the sources of information, but for which the working group could not find enough information on possible substances of concern, or for which the information present could not be verified. The Compendium is a living list which should be periodically updated by EFSA. As a consequence, the absence of a given species in this Compendium cannot be interpreted as this species devoid of compounds hazardous for human health. In the same way, not mentioning a specific part of plant, does not imply absence of substance(s) of concern in this part...|$|E

40|$|International audienceFollowing the {{revision}} and transposition of the EU Waste Framework Directive into the French legal framework, {{it has been}} essential to define guidance and methods for sustainable reuse of excavated soils which would ensure human health and environmental protection. One provision of the European Directive sets that excavated soils that are not reused on site {{should be considered as}} waste and managed as such under national policies. In order to clarify these rules and provide stakeholders with a common operational framework, the French Ministry for Environment called upon BRGM and INERIS to draft a guidance for the reuse of excavated soils in off-site locations (i. e. within road construction, or development projects) and to develop the necessary tools for its implementation at local / regional scale. Following a review of European countries practice in this field, methodological tools have been developed with the support of working groups which included a wide range of stakeholders (professional unions, environmental protection association, planners, lawyers, etc.). The tools are now freely available from the French Portal for contaminated land management ([URL] After a short presentation on the French Soil management framework, its aims and the general scheme, this paper will focus on the tools that have been developed in support to the implementation program. The first developed tool is Hydrotex. It is used for groundwater risk assessments. It enables to assess whether the reuse of excavated soils in a specific off-site location will affect or not groundwater resource quality. Using the Hydrotex spreadsheet, a specific groundwater concentration is calculated from the excavated soil concentration. This concentration is determined for each off-site receiver site and for each <b>substance</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> at the groundwater target to be protected. To keep track of the excavated soils quality and their reuse, an information traceability system is implemented using the TERRASS database which is an interactive tool, available online. These traceability measures will allow for the monitoring of excavated soil volumes from a producer site to a receiver site. The receiver site can be a transit hub / cluster, a treatment center or directly a receiver site (for a development project or road construction). The database will also provide indicators...|$|E

They are now public available on the French Portal for Contaminated land management ([URL] At the crossing of two management policies The French policy on contaminated land focuses on two main concepts: * Risk analysis and management rather than consideration of an intrinsic level of pollution; * Management based on the use of the site. The presentation focuses on the difficulty to initiate a French management policy on excavated soils in agreement with the French policy on contaminated land (site specific approach) and the Waste policy based on a generic approach with guidelines values. Excavated soil off-site reuse methodology The presentation will focus on the main principles of the methodology, especially the conditions of reuse. After characterization of soils to be reused, the methodology provides two types of reuse on a receiver site : - For road construction, - As part of a development project (for which a building permit or an EIS is issued) and if the three following criteria are respected: - Criterion 1 : soil quality of the receiving site is maintained; - Criterion 2 : water resources and ecosystems are preserved beneath the receiver site, - Criterion 3 : Excavated soils are compatible with the future use of the receiver site (only in the context of development projects). Tools developed as part of the french soil management framework After presenting shortly the French Soil management framework, its aims and the general scheme, this second part of the presentation will focus on tools developed to support the implementation program. Two main tools were developed in order to support the methodology. The first tool, HydroTex, concerns groundwater risk assessment. It was developed to verify that the off-site reuse of excavated soil will not affect the groundwater resource quality. The Hydrotex spreadsheet provides a specific result for each off-site receiver site and for each <b>substance</b> <b>of</b> <b>concern</b> (on single substance basis). The tool proposes harmonized entrance parameters for the groundwater modeling model. This assessment determines the maximum soil concentration for the relevant substance to protect the groundwater resource at the target endpoint. To keep track of excavated soil quality, an information traceability system is implemented through the TERRASS database, an interactive tool for excavated soil banking, available online. These traceability measures allow monitoring the excavated soil volumes from a producer site to a receiver site. This receiver site can be a transit hub / cluster, a treatment center or directly a receiver site (for a development project or road construction).
