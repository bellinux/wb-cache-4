50|$|Elements of the <b>Silver</b> <b>Fork</b> novel {{are found}} in the {{character}} of Miss Havisham and her world, as well as Pip's illusions. This genre, which flourished in the 1820s and 1830s, presents the flashy elegance and aesthetic frivolities found in high society. In some respects, Dickens conceived Great Expectations as an anti <b>Silver</b> <b>Fork</b> novel, attacking Charles Lever's novel A Day's Ride, publication of which began January 1860, in Household Words. This {{can be seen in the}} way that Dickens satirises the pretensions and morals of Miss Havisham and her sycophants, including the Pockets (except Matthew), and Uncle Pumblechook.|$|R

60|$|The box {{was found}} to contain a number of objects which Clive {{pronounced}} to be by no means necessary to his wife's and child's existence. Trinket-boxes and favourite little gimcracks, chains, rings and pearl necklaces, the tiara poor Rosey had worn at court--the feathers and the gorgeous train which had decorated the little person--all these were found packed away in this one receptacle; and in another box, I am sorry to say, were the <b>silver</b> <b>forks</b> and spoons (the butler wisely judging that the rich and splendid electrotype ware {{might as well be}} left behind)--all the <b>silver</b> <b>forks,</b> spoons, and ladles, and our poor old friend the cocoa-nut tree, which these female robbers would have carried out of the premises.|$|R

40|$|In {{the years}} {{leading up to}} and away from the Reform Act of 1832, opera and {{politics}} came into alignment for writers of <b>silver</b> <b>fork</b> fiction, particularly Catherine Gore and Lady Charlotte Bury. The King’s Theatre in the Haymarket, the home of Italian opera in London, provided them with a politically charged public space for women, one of the few available, in which they could examine the consequences of political reform on women’s lives, particularly the conflicts faced by aristocratic women before the irresistible force of middleclass social mores. Through the King’s Theatre with its stairs, corridors, boxes, and class-differentiated spaces, the <b>silver</b> <b>fork</b> novelists track the consequences of Whig politics. Employing Italian opera as a national trope both for its aristocratic associations and its symbolic plots, Gore and Bury mount a probing assessment of contemporary political change through a fusion of fashion and politics...|$|R

6000|$|... "As for {{all this}} cry about aristocracy, I don't {{understand}} it. Hugh Littlepage has just as good a right to his ways as I have to mine. The gentleman says he needs gold spoons and <b>silver</b> <b>forks</b> to eat with. Well, what of that? I dare say the gentleman himself finds a steel knife and fork useful, and has no objection to a silver, or, at least, to a pewter spoon. Now, there are folks that use wooden forks, or no forks, and who are glad to get horn spoons; and they might call that gentleman himself an aristocrat. This setting of ourselves up as the standard in all things is anything but liberty. If I don't like to eat my dinner {{with a man who}} uses a <b>silver</b> <b>fork,</b> no man in this country can compel me. On the other hand, if young Mr. Littlepage don't like a companion who chews tobacco, as I do, he ought to be left to follow his own inclination.|$|R
