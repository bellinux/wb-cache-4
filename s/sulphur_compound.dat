40|$|AbstractTulbaghia {{species are}} used in {{traditional}} medicine in southern Africa. They contain <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds,</b> which have anti-Candida activity. The <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> are unstable, so different extraction methods were investigated. Grinding the rhizome material in liquid nitrogen and extraction with ethanol yielded the best results. Eight Tulbaghia species were tested and found to contain {{the same pattern of}} <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> on the TLC plate, though in varying concentrations, except T. simmleri, for which <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> could not be detected. This means that more species can potentially be utilised for the drug Tulbaghiae rhizoma. A simple quantitative TLC dilution method was developed, which can be used to ascertain whether the rhizome material contains a sufficient level of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds.</b> The effect of storage was investigated. The content of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> in the rhizomes decreased fast upon storage, half of the main compound was lost four weeks after harvest. Possible adulterants for Tulbaghiae rhizoma are Allium sativum and Agapanthus campanulatus.

Six grape musts were used (Trajadura, Pedernã, Loureiro, Azal Branco, Avesso and Alvarinho). Ammonium supplementation of Trajadura and Pedernã grape musts, with the highest nitrogen level, did not influence the content of heavy sulphur compounds and aliphatic higher alcohols in wines; however, the addition of ammonium salts to grape musts with low initial nitrogen content, such as Loureiro, Azal Branco and Avesso, led to a higher production of 1 -propanol and a lower production of isoamyl alcohols and sulphur compounds, e. g. S-methyl thioacetate, 2 -mercaptoethanol, acetic acid- 3 -(methylthio) propyl ester, 3 -mercapto- 1 -propanol, 4 -(methylthio) - 1 -butanol, 3 -(ethyithio) - 1 -propanol. 3 -methylthiopropionic acid and N- 3 -(methylthiopropyl) acetamide.

40|$|Increasing {{concern about}} air {{pollution}} {{has led many}} countries to adopt more stringent regulations, which impose an ultra-low concentration of sulphur in gasoline. These regulations place many challenges for the refining industry. Lower sulphur levels are being recommended for gasoline and diesel for environmental reasons. New methods and innovations are required to further reduce the sulphur level in liquid fuels. Separation process design to accomplish the removal of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> requires knowledge of the vapour-liquid equilibrium (VLE) of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> with hydrocarbons, particularly their activity coefficients at infinite dilution. However, the investigations concerning the systems containing <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> are very limited. This thesis deals with the VLE measurements of selected <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> (1 -propanethiol, diethyl sulphide, and thiophene) with various hydrocarbons (C 6 to C 8) and 2 -ethoxy- 2 -methylpropane (ETBE) under isobaric and isothermal conditions, using a circulation still and the infinite dilutions activity coefficients measurements of 1 -propanethiol, ethyl methyl sulphide, and thiophene in toluene, n-heptane, and 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane at 90  kPa using comparative ebulliometer techniques. The gamma-phi approach {{was used in the}} calculation of VLE. The activity coefficients of the liquid phase (γ) were correlated with the Wilson model. The Wilson model gave a good correlation for all systems. The activity coefficients at infinite dilution (γ∞) were extrapolated from the VLE measurements with the Wilson model. The γ∞ values of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> for the systems thiophene + toluene and thiophene + 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane obtained from the recirculation still measurements are compared with the γ∞ values of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> obtained from the comparative ebulliometer measurements. The agreement between the measurements is good. All the measured γ∞ of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> in hydrocarbons are less than two. 1 -Propanethiol, thiophene, and diethyl sulphide in toluene show nearly ideal behaviour, and thus the γ∞ of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> for these systems are one. The activity coefficients of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> in hydrocarbons show the typical behaviour of positive deviations from Raoult's law, which become smaller with increasing temperature and with {{an increase in the number}} of C-atoms of the alkanes. The systems 1 -propanethiol, thiophene, and diethyl sulphide in toluene show nearly ideal behaviour. No azeotrope formation was observed for the systems thiophene + 1 -hexene and diethyl sulphide + 1 -hexene. The reaction between 1 -propanethiol and 1 -hexene was observed. The systems thiophene + n-hexane and thiophene + 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane, as well as the systems diethyl sulphide + n-heptane and diethyl sulphide + 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane, show positive deviations from Raoult's law. These systems exhibit maximum pressure azeotropy. The systems thiophene + 1 -hexene and thiophene + 2 -ethoxy- 2 -methylpropane, as well as the systems diethyl sulphide with n-hexane, 1 -hexene, cyclohexane, and 2 -ethoxy- 2 -methylpropane, show positive deviation and strong nonideality. No azeotropes formed in these systems. The original UNIFAC predictive model is adequate to describe the behaviour of sulphur in hydrocarbons, even though its application is limited to the availability of the functional group interaction parameters. COSMO-RS gives poor prediction for all the systems studied, and thus it is not currently a suitable model for predicting the behaviour of systems containing <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds.</b> These new consistent measurements can be used to improve and develop thermodynamic models in dilute systems, and thus the behaviour of organic <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> in the distillation of hydrocarbons can be simulated. reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Bacteria {{from the}} genus Acidithiobacillus are often {{associated}} with biominingand acid mine drainage. Biomining utilises acidophilic, sulphur and ironoxidising microorganisms for recovery of metals from sulphidic low grade oresand concentrates. Acid mine drainage results in acidification and contaminationwith metals of soil and water emanating from the dissolution of metal sulphidesfrom deposits and mine waste storage. Acidophilic microorganisms play acentral role in these processes by catalysing aerobic oxidation of sulphides. Acceleration of mineral solubilisation is a positive aspect in biomining whereas,in acid mine drainage it is undesirable and accordingly, microbial iron andsulphur oxidation is promoted {{in the first case}} and measures are taken to inhibitit in the second case. In this thesis, several approaches were taken in order tounderstand and increase oxidation efficiency in biomining and to gain an insightinto the biochemical reactions taking place in these environments. A laboratoryscale bioreactor was designed and tested allowing simulation of bioleaching inheaps of mine tailings at different aeration, irrigation and particle size conditions(Paper I).

40|$|The {{emission}} of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> {{into the environment}} is undesirable because of their acidifying characteristics. The processing of sulphidic ores, oil refining and sulphuric acid production are major sources of SO 2 emissions. Hydrogen sulphide is emitted into the environment as dissolved sulphide in wastewater or as H 2 S in natural gas, biogas, syngas or refinery gases. Waste streams containing sulphate are generated by many industries, including mining, metallurgical, pulp and paper and petrochemical industries. Applying process technologies that rely on the biological sulphur cycle can prevent environmental pollution. In nature <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> may cycle {{through a series of}} oxidation states (- 2, 0, + 2, + 4, + 6).

In H 2 S-exposed plants, the accumulation of <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds</b> in the shoots was nearly linear with the concentration (0. 15 - 0. 6 mul l(- 1)) and duration of the exposure.

Furthermore, there was a substantial increase in the sulphate content in the shoots upon H 2 S exposure. The accumulation of sulphate originated both from the pedosphere and from the oxidation of absorbed atmospheric sulphide, and/or from the degradation of accumulated secondary <b>sulphur</b> <b>compounds.</b> From studies on the interaction between atmospheric and pedospheric sulphur nutrition it was evident that H 2 S exposure did not result in a down-regulation of the sulphate uptake by the roots...|$|R
