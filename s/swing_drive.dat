40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{a number of}} hybrid {{architectures}} have been proposed with the main goal of minimizing energy consumption of excavator swing drives. One {{of the most notorious}} architectures is the secondary controlled hydraulic <b>swing</b> <b>drive.</b> One of the advantages of this system is that, through the installation of a hydraulic accumulator, energy which otherwise would be wasted can be stored and reutilized on demand. However, the fact that the hydraulic motor in this architecture operates under a constant high pressure at all times diminishes the overall system efficiency significantly. Therefore, to investigate machine power management strategies, it is imperative to formulate a controller that overcomes this weakness. In this paper, a robust multi-input multi-output controller is synthesized for the control of the hybrid swing velocity and for first time the control of the accumulator state of charge. The simplified plant is tested using a high fidelity nonlinear model developed in the Simulink-Matlab environment. The proposed controller is then tested and compared against a PI controller using the optimal accumulator pressure obtained from dynamic programming and the desired cab velocity. Results show satisfactory tracking of the <b>swing</b> <b>drive</b> velocity and pressure. In addition, a study of the nominal stability, robust stability and robust performance of the controlled system reveals the advantages of the H âˆž controller...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis has been to design and {{simulate}} different concepts of a secondary controlled <b>swing</b> <b>drive</b> for a wheel excavator. Secondary control is a known technology {{in the field of}} hydraulics that offers precise positioning as well as the possibility of energy recuperation. Secondary control is today used in certain industrial applications and is rather unemployed in mobile machinery. An excavator moves high loads in cyclic motions which are ideal conditions for energy recuperating systems. A study of the potential of a secondary controlled <b>swing</b> <b>drive</b> is therefore interesting. The focus has been on testing different circuit architectures and emergency brake concepts. The results of the design process have been three types of circuit architectures and two types of hydraulic safety concepts. The results of the simulation have shown that the open and closed circuit architecture have similar energy efficiency. The closed circuit with low pressure accumulator however offers the best controllability. At least 20 % energy savings can be achieved by storing thekinetic energy when braking. A hydraulic emergency brake must function, independent on the direction of rotation of the excavator during a failure. The first principle recognises the rotation direction and changes the swivel angle of the secondary unit so that a braking torque is created. In the second principle a pressure difference is built up over the secondary unit that always results in a braking torque. Simulationshave shown that the principle with recognition of the speed direction is the most effective safety concept...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{physical}} model for electronic switching in cantilever based nano-electro-mechanical field effect transistors, {{focusing on the}} steepness of its switching curve. We find that the subthreshold swing of the voltage transfer characteristic is governed by two separate considerations - {{the ability of the}} charges to correlate together through dipolar interactions and amplify the active torque, versus the active pull-in forces that drive an abrupt phase transition and close the air gap between the tip of the cantilever and the drain. For small sized relays, dipolar and short-range Van Der Waals 'sticking' forces dominate, while for longer cantilevers the capacitive energy acquires a major role. The individual pull-in and pull-out phases demonstrate a remarkably low subthreshold <b>swing</b> <b>driven</b> by the capacitive forces, sharpened further by dipolar correlation.

Central to this discussion {{is the concept of}} ring amplification. A ring amplifier is a small modular amplifier derived from a ring oscillator that naturally embodies all the essential elements of scalability. It can amplify with accurate rail-to-rail output <b>swing,</b> <b>drive</b> large capacitive loads with extreme efficiency using slew-based charging, naturally scale in performance according to process trends, and is simple enough to be quickly constructed from only a handful of inverters, capacitors, and switches. In addition, the gain-enhancement technique of Split-CLS is introduced, and used to extend the efficacy of ring amplifiers in specific and other amplifiers in general. Four different pipelined ADC designs are presented which explore the practical implementation options and design considerations relevant to ring amplification and Split-CLS, and are used to establish ring amplification as a new paradigm for scalable amplification...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to devise and evaluate various implementable power management schemes for a novel hydraulic hybrid architecture (called the displacement-controlled series-parallel (DC S-P) hybrid architecture) for mobile, multi-actuator machine systems, with reduced engine power. Specifically, the power management schemes proposed were applied to a proto-type mini-excavator on which the DC S-P hybrid architecture was implemented {{as part of this}} work. ^ Previous work had demonstrated significant improvements in overall machine efficiency through transition from the current, standard load-sensing architecture to throttle-less, DC actuation. Measurements showed 40 % fuel savings on a prototype, mini-excavator with DC actuation, over a standard mini-excavator in side-by-side testing. Hybridization (through use of hydraulic accumulators) enables storage and re-use of braking energy recovered from the <b>swing</b> <b>drive</b> (and in general, from the rotary actuators), and drastic engine downsizing. A feasibility study undertaken in simulation showed that {{with the use of a}} conservative power management scheme, the DC S-P hydraulic hybrid excavator with 50 % reduced engine power, offered efficiency improvements over the prototype DC excavator. ^ This work focuses primarily on implementable power management schemes for such hybrid hydraulic multi-actuator machine systems with reduced engine power. A rule-based strategy was first studied that could exploit all available system degrees of freedom. This showed the potential to obtain higher fuel savings than the preliminary, conservative power management scheme wherein only one system degree of freedom was utilized, for both the parallel-hybrid DC architecture as well as the DC S-P hybrid architecture. ^ Patterns in optimal state trajectories and control histories obtained from dynamic programming were also analyzed and identified for various cycles. The rule-based approach lends itself well to replicate optimal results, while exploiting all system degrees of freedom. However, the rules employed for charging the accumulator through the primary unit vary with the duty cycle, and thus a practical solution entails offering the operator a set of rule-based supervisory controllers to choose from. ^ An instantaneous optimization-based approach was also studied, wherein an equivalent fuel consumption objective is minimized at every instant. The strategy proposed, called the equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS), is a promising cycle-independent approach for near-optimal, implementable power management, and approximating optimal behavior for parts of the duty cycle. ^ Transition from the non-hybrid DC architecture on a prototype excavator toward the DC S-P hybrid hydraulic architecture was also achieved as part of this work. An appropriate motion control scheme for closed-loop speed control of the secondary-controlled <b>swing</b> <b>drive</b> was also designed and implemented on the prototype. Engine load-leveling or power limitation (by up to 50 %) was demonstrated in measurement through the use of the single-point strategy in a digging cycle (albeit the engine was not actually downsized on the actual prototype). The minimum-speed strategy was also demonstrated on the prototype, where all system degrees of freedom were exploited (including engine speed variation) while maintaining engine power output near 50 % engine power. ...|$|E
