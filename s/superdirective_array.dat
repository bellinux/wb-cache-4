However, system imperfections, electronic noise and acoustic scatter from the array structure can degrade their performance. An acoustic calibration of a six-element line array, 0. 8 m in length, has been performed over the frequency range 1 to 4 kHz in order to investigate {{the performance of a}} real array. The data is used to identify the angular variation of the hydrophone outputs and the phase difference between hydrophone pairs.

30|$|Sensor array signal {{processing}} {{has played a}} significant role in many diverse application areas, including sonar, radar, audio engineering, and wireless communication [1]. As an important topic in sensor array {{signal processing}}, superdirectivity has received considerable attention for decades [2 – 6], because it can provide a significant potential for sensor arrays to enhance their performance, such as in terms of angular resolution, bearing estimation accuracy, noise suppression ability, and reduction of array aperture. A wideband constant beamwidth and shortened near-field zone can also be conveniently obtained. However, open problems concerning superdirectivity exist in error sensitivity or performance robustness.

The following antennas and related structures are discussed: electrically small antennas, impedance matching of antennas, microstrip antennas, microwave and millimeter-wave antenna <b>arrays,</b> and <b>superdirective</b> <b>arrays.</b> The greatest potential practical improvements occur for large microwave and millimeter-wave arrays and the impedance matching of antennas...|$|R
40|$|International audience—The inter-element {{distance}} in <b>superdirective</b> <b>arrays</b> is usually {{very small and}} hence the mutual coupling is considerably high. Consequently, these arrays present relatively low efficiencies.

The concept is proven by full wave simulations of two different Electrically Small Antenna (ESA) -based two-element arrays with an inter-element distance of 0. 1 λ. In the first array with a ka = 0. 56, the original (before decoupling) radiation efficiency of 7 % is increased to 13. 4 % and the realized gain is increased from − 6. 4 dBi to − 2. 6 dBi.

40|$|Broadband {{beamforming}} {{applied to}} <b>superdirective</b> <b>arrays</b> {{is known to}} be highly sensitive to transducers characteristics errors. Recently, an effective method to synthesize a robust, broadband, data-independent, filter-and-sum beamformer, which considers the probability distributions of errors, has been proposed. It considers an array with arbitrary lay-out and provides a spatial directivity pattern close to the desired one. Unfortunately, the evaluation of the cost function requires a computational load and an amount of memory that increases very quickly with the transducers and the filter coefficients. As the synthesis process requires an iterative minimization, it may become unacceptably long. In this paper, an alternative procedure for evaluating the same cost function is presented, drastically reducing such problems and without introducing any approximation. The only additional constraint is on the antenna which must be an equally-spaced linear array. This procedure makes it much easier to apply the above-mentioned synthesis method to a wide panorama of practical situations...|$|R
40|$|A <b>superdirective</b> <b>array</b> {{of audio}} drivers is described, which is compact {{compared}} with the acoustic wavelength over some of its frequency range. In order to minimize the overall sound power output, and hence reduce the excitation of the reverberant field when used in an enclosed space, the individual drivers are made directional by using phase shift enclosures. The motivating application for the array is the enhancement of sound from a television, in a particular region of space, to aid hearing impaired listeners. The design is initially investigated, using free-field simulations, by comparing the performance of 8 monopoles, 8 phase shift loudspeakers, and a double array of 16 monopoles, with a contrast maximization formulation. The construction and testing of an array of 8 drivers is then discussed, together with its measured response in an anechoic environment.

This model is capable of easily but accurately predicting the far field radiation behaviours of an electrically small parasitic array of two SSRRs (the two SSRRs are not necessarily standard and identical), based on certain information of the array, namely the SSRRs' dimensions, the SSRRs' electrical components (L, C and R), the SSRRs' rotating orientation angles (α 1 and α 2), the two SSRRs's separation (d) and the array's operation frequency. The impor- tance of this analytical model in designing parasitic superdirective arrays is discussed. Simulation {{results show that the}} model predicted two-SSRR parasitic superdirective structure (the `CC' structure) can achieve an end- fire directivity of 4. 36, with an elements' separation d = 4 mm working at 1 : 914 GHz, and can maintain an efficiencyciency as high as 98 : 6 %. After a short discussion of the design principle behind the `CC' structure, improved su- perdirective structures of are identified and studied based on simulation results. Among these structures, the 'CCLr' structure can achieve the largest directivity value of 5. 06 (very close to 5. 25, the theoretical limit value of a two-dipole array) with a moderate efficiency of 81 : 4 %. A com- parison between these two-SSRR parasitic superdirective structures (the `CC' and its improved versions) and two commercial two-element Yagi an- tennas show that these two-SSRR structures achieve better directive per- formances than the commercial two-element Yagi antennas do.
