5|$|With its heavyset body, conical bulbous snout, {{and large}} mouth filled with {{protruding}} teeth, the {{bigeye sand tiger}} looks much like the better-known sand tiger shark. The large eyes lack nictitating membranes, and behind them are small spiracles. The corner of the mouth extends to behind {{the level of the}} eyes, and the jaws are highly protrusible. There are 34–43 upper and 37–46 lower tooth rows; these include zero to two rows of small teeth at the upper symphysis (jaw midpoint) and two to four more rows at the lower symphysis. In each half of the upper jaw, the teeth in the first and second rows are large, those in the third and sometimes fourth rows are small, and those in the rows after are large again. Each tooth has a narrow, awl-like central cusp flanked by one smaller cusplet on each side; this contrasts with the <b>smalltooth</b> <b>sand</b> <b>tiger,</b> which has two or three lateral cusplets on each side. There are five pairs of gill slits.|$|E
500|$|The {{first known}} {{bigeye sand tiger}} was a female [...] long caught off Madeira in April 1941, on a {{longline}} set for black scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo). The specimen was mounted and later {{formed the basis for}} a scientific description authored by German ichthyologist Günther Maul in a 1955 article for Notulae Naturae. He named the species noronhai in honor of Adolfo César de Noronha, the late Director of the Funchal Museum. Maul assigned his new species to the genus Carcharias, which at the time was used for all members of the sand tiger shark family. When the Odontaspis came to be recognized as a valid genus separate from Carcharias, the bigeye sand tiger was reassigned as well given its resemblance to the <b>smalltooth</b> <b>sand</b> <b>tiger</b> (O. ferox).

5|$|Whether the bigeye and <b>smalltooth</b> <b>sand</b> <b>tigers</b> {{belong in}} the same family as the superficially similar <b>sand</b> <b>tiger</b> shark (C. taurus) has been debated among systematists, with {{morphological}} and dentitional studies giving inconsistent results. A 2012 molecular phylogenetic analysis, based on mitochondrial DNA, supported a sister species relationship between O. noronhai and O. ferox but not a clade consisting of Odontaspis and Carcharias. Instead, Odontaspis was found to be closer to the crocodile shark (Pseudocarcharias kamoharai), suggesting that it and Carcharias should be placed in separate families.|$|R

5000|$|No {{pregnant}} <b>smalltooth</b> <b>sand</b> <b>tigers</b> {{have ever}} been found; this species is presumed to be ovoviviparous as in other mackerel sharks. Villaviencio-Garayzar (1996) described a 3.6 m (11.8 ft) female from the Gulf of California that contained [...] "hundreds of ova" [...] in her right ovary, which would support the embryos being oophagous. Whether the embryos also cannibalize each other as in the grey nurse shark is unknown. The size at birth {{is estimated to be}} 1.0 - 1.1 m (3.3 - 3.6 ft). With a few recorded exceptions, juveniles are found in deep water and only adults are present above a depth of 200 m (660 ft); this may serve to reduce predation on young individuals by large, shallow-water predators such as the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias). Males mature at a length of 2.0 - 2.5 m (6.6 - 8.2 ft) and females at a length of 3.0 - 3.5 m (9.4 - 11.5 ft). Faint scars seen on some individuals may be related to courtship.|$|R
2500|$|The {{majority}} of prey items of <b>sand</b> <b>tigers</b> are demersal (i.e. {{from the sea}} bottom), suggesting that they hunt extensively on the sea bottom as far out as the continental shelf. Bony fish (Teleosts) form about 60% of <b>sand</b> <b>tigers</b> food, the remaining prey comprising sharks and skates. In Argentina, the prey includes mostly demersal fishes, e.g. the striped weakfish (Cynoscion guatucupa). The most important elasmobranch prey is the bottom-living smooth-hound shark (Mustelus sp.). Benthic (i.e. free-swimming) rays and skates are also taken. Stomach content analysis indicates that smaller <b>sand</b> <b>tigers</b> mainly focus on the sea bottom and as they grow larger they start to take more benthic prey. This perspective of the diet of <b>sand</b> <b>tigers</b> is consistent with similar observations in the north west Atlantic and in South Africa where large <b>sand</b> <b>tigers</b> capture {{a wider range of}} shark and skate species as prey, from the surf zone to the continental shelf, indicating the opportunistic nature of <b>sand</b> <b>tiger</b> feeding. Off South Africa, <b>sand</b> <b>tigers</b> less than [...] in length prey on fish about a quarter of their own length; however, large <b>sand</b> <b>tigers</b> capture prey up to about half of their own length.

5|$|Since Carcharocles {{is derived}} from Otodus, and the two had teeth that bear a close {{similarity}} {{to those of the}} <b>sand</b> <b>tiger</b> shark (Carcharias taurus), megalodon may have had a build more similar to the <b>sand</b> <b>tiger</b> shark than to other sharks.

40|$|This thesis reviews {{reproductive}} behavior in <b>sand</b> <b>tiger</b> sharks (Carcharias taurus). <b>Sand</b> <b>tigers</b> occur in temperate coastal waters worldwide {{except for the}} central and eastern Pacific Ocean. The species exists as isolated populations with little mixing, and its population status varies from vulnerable to critically endangered, depending upon location. <b>Sand</b> <b>tigers</b> employ a unique method of embryonic development known as adelphophagy and oophagy in which the first pup to hatch inside each uterus consumes the remaining developing embryos and unfertilized egg capsules. <b>Sand</b> <b>tigers</b> migrate seasonally, with migration coupled to their reproductive cycle, and closely tied to {{reproductive behavior}}.

40|$|Oliver, Matthew J. Quantifying the {{biogeography}} {{of coastal}} marine species {{is difficult and}} requires innovative study designs. These challenges are the motivation behind this dissertation. The <b>Sand</b> <b>Tiger</b> shark (Carcharias taurus) is an important apex predator in the coastal oceans along the Eastern Coast of the United States. I conducted {{a study in the}} Delaware Bay and Mid-Atlantic coastal Ocean, which used historical species location records from acoustic telemetry matched to static and satellite-measured dynamic environmental predictor variables, to create a near-real time predictive species distribution model. Notably we found <b>Sand</b> <b>Tigers</b> were predicted by water temperature, water depth, day length and ocean color absorption in the near-infrared, which likely relates to turbidity in the coastal ocean. In this study I identified the timing and location of migratory corridors used by <b>Sand</b> <b>Tigers,</b> as well as how the timing and location of migration differed between juvenile, mature male and mature female <b>Sand</b> <b>Tigers.</b> ☐ In my second study, I investigated the timing and migration of <b>Sand</b> <b>Tigers</b> along the Delmarva Peninsula on much smaller spatiotemporal scales during their fall migration south, a time during which <b>Sand</b> <b>Tigers</b> are susceptible to anthropogenic threats. For the first time, I used an autonomous underwater vehicle to concurrently detect <b>Sand</b> <b>Tigers</b> carrying acoustic tags, and measure fine scale environmental properties of the sub-surface ocean to determine habitat selectivity. I found that <b>Sand</b> <b>Tigers</b> migrated rapidly and en masse through the coastal ocean off the Delmarva Peninsula and were selecting for waters near-shore, lower in salinity, and higher in color dissolved organic matter. These results support the larger scale patterns in environmental predictors I found in my first study, as well as prove that using autonomous underwater vehicles is an effective method for extending our capabilities of detecting acoustically tagged marine species. ☐ Finally, I developed a novel tagging method that implanted an archival acoustic receiver into the body cavity of <b>Sand</b> <b>Tigers,</b> which were released alive and continued to conduct their annual migration before they were recaptured and the tags were removed. This tagging method allowed me to record associations between <b>Sand</b> <b>Tigers</b> and other acoustically tagged species for one year of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Tigers</b> life. Analysis of that dataset revealed potential fission-fusion behavior, or the change in size and composition of groups, in the <b>Sand</b> <b>Tiger</b> population depending on where the <b>Sand</b> <b>Tigers</b> were along the East Coast, and what they were likely doing during that time (i. e. feeding, searching for mates, migrating, etc.). I observed <b>Sand</b> <b>Tiger</b> aggregations change from mixed groups of male and female juveniles and adults, to groups of only adult males, to solitary phases where <b>Sand</b> <b>Tigers</b> were completely dispersed for weeks at a time. This study is important because it suggests the potential for social behavior in a shark species, but also identifies the possibility of anthropogenic impacts disproportionally impacting one sector of the <b>Sand</b> <b>Tiger</b> population as the composition of their aggregations changes in time and space. This dissertation uses advances in remote sensing and animal tagging methods to provide insights into the species distribution, habitat selection, and the migratory and grouping behavior of a coastal shark species under threat of population decline due to anthropogenic impacts along the East Coast of the United States and provides insights into the ecology and biogeography of this species that will assist managers and researchers in future conservation efforts for this and other imperiled species.
