500|$|An A.V. Club {{retrospective}} group review {{praised the}} episode, {{especially for the}} food fight. The reviewers also highlighted the effective <b>short</b> <b>reference</b> and a toast by the characters to their past colleague and friend, the late Coach Ernie Pantusso, and the setting {{of much of the}} episode at Carla's house rather than at the bar. Molly Eichel, one of the reviewers, was especially interested in moments other than the food fight, such as the [...] "childishness" [...] (also described as [...] "devolution") of the characters, Diane's motherliness toward the gang, and Eichel's [...] "favorite part", Vera's long-awaited appearance, even though her face was covered with pumpkin pie.|$|E

6000|$|LIFE. Jonson {{was born}} at Westminster about the year 1573. His father, an educated gentleman, had his {{property}} confiscated and was himself thrown into prison by Queen Mary; so we infer the family was of some prominence. From his mother he received certain strong characteristics, and by a single <b>short</b> <b>reference</b> in Jonson's works we are led to {{see the kind of}} woman she was. It is while Jonson is telling Drummond of the occasion when he was thrown into prison, because some passages in the comedy of Eastward Ho! gave offense to King James, and he was in danger of a horrible death, after having his ears and nose cut off. He tells us how, after his pardon, he was banqueting with his friends, when his [...] "old mother" [...] came in and showed a paper full of [...] "lusty strong poison," [...] which she intended to mix with his drink just before the execution. And to show that she [...] "was no churl," [...] she intended first to drink of the poison herself. The incident is all the more suggestive from the fact that Chapman and Marston, one his friend and the other his enemy, were first cast into prison as the authors of Eastward Ho! and rough Ben Jonson at once declared that he too had had a small hand in the writing and went to join them in prison.|$|E

50|$|The SGML {{standard}} {{describes it}} in terms of maps and recognition modes (s9.6.1). Each entity, and each element, can have an associated notation or declared content type, which determines the kinds of references and tags which will be recognized in that entity and element. Also, each element can have an associated delimiter map (and <b>short</b> <b>reference</b> map), which determines which characters are treated as delimiters in context. The SGML standard characterizes parsing as a state machine switching between recognition modes. During parsing, there is a stack of maps that configure the scanner, while the tokenizer relates to the recognition modes.|$|E
