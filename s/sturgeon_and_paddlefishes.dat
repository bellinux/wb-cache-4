40|$|Background: The {{international}} wildlife {{trade is}} a key threat to biodiversity. Temporal genetic marketplace monitoring can determine if wildlife trade regulation efforts such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) are succeeding. Protected under CITES effective 1997, <b>sturgeons</b> <b>and</b> <b>paddlefishes,</b> the producers of black caviar, are flagship CITES species. Methodology/Principal Findings: We test whether CITES has limited the amount of fraudulent black caviar reaching the marketplace. Using mitochondrial DNA-based methods, we compare mislabeling in caviar and meat purchased in the New York City area pre and post CITES listing. Our recent sampling of this market reveals a decrease in mislabeled caviar (2006 – 2008; 10 %; n = 90) compared to pre-CITES implementation (1995 – 1996; 19 %; n = 95). Mislabeled caviar was found only in online purchase (n = 49 online/ 41 retail). Conclusions/Significance: Stricter controls on importing and exporting as per CITES policies may be having a positive conservation effect by limiting the amount of fraudulent caviar reaching the marketplace. <b>Sturgeons</b> <b>and</b> <b>paddlefishes</b> remain a conservation priority, however, due to continued overfishing and habitat degradation.

500|$|Poaching {{has been}} a {{contributing}} factor to declining populations of American paddlefish in the states where they are commercially exploited, particularly while the demand for caviar remains strong.

50|$|This {{group has}} at times been {{classified}} with the sharks: {{this because the}} chondrosteans, like the latter, mostly lack bone, and their structure of the jaw is more akin to that of sharks than of other bony fish; further, both groups lack scales (excluding the Polypteriforms). Additional shared features include spiracles <b>and,</b> in <b>sturgeons</b> <b>and</b> <b>paddlefishes,</b> a heterocercal tail (the vertebrae extend into the larger lobe of the caudal fin).

40|$|Significant intraindividual {{variation}} in the sequence of the 18 S rRNA gene is unusual in animal genomes.

The research has established that physical and chemical parameters of water in farms' ponds answered the operating pond fishery regulations. The existing level of natural forage base elements can be considered satisfacting for the growing storage material. The best development of zooplankton in the application of polyculture acipenseriformes should be noted. The monoculture benefit was observed in the most fisheries indicators for certain types. Sturgeon fish productivity advantage in terms of polyculture is the evidence of positive mutual influences among the reservoir consumers of different trophic levels. In terms of polyculture the significant benefit of total fish productivity indicator was observed. It clearly points to the prospects of the measure in terms of substantial efficiency of pond areas for growing storage fingerlings. Results of acipenseriformes growing in mono- and polyculture clearly favor the polyculture, which could be used in breeding practice. Scientific Originality. In specific conditions of the southern Ukraine the influence of environmental and technological conditions for growing storage fingerlings acipenseriformes fish (<b>sturgeon</b> <b>and</b> <b>paddlefish)</b> was investigated for the first time.

40|$|Historically, many Midwestern {{migratory fish}} species, such as lake <b>sturgeon</b> (Acipenser fulvescens) <b>and</b> <b>paddlefish</b> (Polyodon spathula), had free and {{unobstructed}} access to feeding and spawning areas in rivers and tributaries throughout their {{range in the}} Midwest, including the Great Lakes. Major river systems, such as the Menominee River in northern Wisconsin and the Wisconsin River in central Wisconsin, at one time supported vast spawning migrations. Within the past 100 years, however, construction and operation of hydroelectric dams on these river systems has interrupted much of these great migrations. This fragmentation and loss of habitat {{has contributed to the}} decline of the lake <b>sturgeon</b> <b>and</b> <b>paddlefish</b> populations throughout the Midwest. One method for reestablishing this lost connection is to create an artificial pathway such as a fish passage facility (i. e., fishway). The U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) has been working with state and local partners in Wisconsin and Michigan to design and build fishways to reestablish migratory corridors on rivers historically important to lake <b>sturgeon</b> <b>and</b> <b>paddlefish.</b> In particular, the FWS has been working on two fish passage projects, one on the Wisconsin River near Prairie du Sac, WI (a hydroelectric dam licensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission; FERC) and another at a FERC dam on the Menominee River, a tributary to Lake Michigan near Menominee, MI. At both of these locations, fish passage is complicated by the occurrence of invasive species and disease downstream of the dam, one of which has the added concern of heavy metal contaminants. Of particular concern to fisheries agencies is the emergence of aquatic threats such as Asian carp (e. g., sliver carp and bighead carp) and fish diseases (e. g., Viral Hemorahgic Septicemia). As these projects move toward completion, the agencies need to take great care in how long term project operation may impact the health of the aquatic ecosystem upstream of the proposed fishway. One solution may be to impose a restriction on numbers and species of fishes to be passed upstream. In addition, fishes allowed to be passed upstream may need to be manually sorted and selected based on strict guidelines as approved by the appropriate state agency with jurisdiction. We will explore fish passage projects at FERC dams in Wisconsin and Michigan and discuss how emerging concerns with invasive species, disease, and contaminants are impacting project planning, design, and long term operation...|$|R
40|$|Electromagnetic fields (EMF) {{originate}} from {{both natural and}} anthropogenic sources. In the sea, natural sources include the Earth’s magnetic field, sea and tidal currents traveling through that field, and various processes within organisms. Electricity moving along cables and various other devices (as a part of renewable offshore energy development) produces both electric and electromagnetic fields. In addition, water currents and organisms moving through human-induced EMF create electric fields. The larger the organism and the closer {{it is to the}} cable, the larger the induced electric field. A potential issue is that some organisms detect electric and/or magnetic fields. Electric fields are detected by cartilaginous fishes (sharks, skates, and rays), as well as ratfishes, <b>sturgeons,</b> <b>and</b> <b>paddlefishes.</b> Some experiments imply that sea lamprey, European river lamprey, European eels, and Atlantic salmon can also detect these fields, although these taxa appear to be much less sensitive than the cartilaginous fishes, <b>sturgeons,</b> <b>and</b> <b>paddlefishes.</b> These animals use this capability for prey and mate detection and perhaps orientation. Among marine organisms, the ability to detect magnetic fields is known to occur in fishes (e. g., eel, trout, salmon, tuna, and sharks) as well as lobsters, turtles, and cetaceans. Several behavioral and physiological experiments imply that rockfishes and flatfishes might also be able to sense magnetic fields. Research implies that organisms may be able to sense EMF down to a few microteslas. Magnetic field detection is likely used by these organisms for orientation, navigation, and homing. It has been hypothesized that anthropogenic EMF might have {{some or all of the}} following effects on marine organisms: 1) Disrupt migrations and movements of marine organisms; 2) Disrupt successful search for prey; 3) Disrupt successful search for mates; 4) Disrupt successful avoidance of predators.

40|$|Abstract. The Mississippi River {{has been}} {{variously}} altered for navigation and flood control but supports a diverse and relatively productive fishery assemblage. In the upper, impounded reach, commercial fish harvest has increased for most species since 1945. The upper reach provides an extensive and moderately used recreational fishery resource. Limited {{information for the}} lower, unimpounded reach of the Mississippi River indicates commercial harvest is increasing. Neither the commercial nor recreational fisheries appear to be overharvested; however, fisheries for <b>sturgeon</b> <b>and</b> <b>paddlefish</b> should be carefully monitored. Future fisheries production may be threatened by loss of aquatic habitat, particularly extrachannel and backwater habitats, from sedimentation and constrained by altered spatial and temporal aspects of floodplain inundation. Water quality has improved substantially from formerly severely degraded conditions. Navigation affects fish survival and recruitment, and increases in navigation are forecast. Future conservation {{and management of the}} fisheries and aquatic resources of the Mississippi River will require substantial investment in effective assessment programs and achieving societal recognition of the diverse values of the resource...|$|R
50|$|Polypodium hydriforme is an endocellular {{parasite}} {{with unusual}} life cycle, peculiar morphology, and {{high rates of}} DNA evolution. Polypodium spends most of its life inside the oocytes of acipenseriform fishes (<b>sturgeons</b> <b>and</b> <b>paddlefish).</b> Its hosts include Acipenser ruthenus, Polyodon spathula and Scaphirhynchus platorynchus. During this time, Polypodium develops from a binucleate cell into an inside-out planuliform larva and then into an elongate inside-out stolon; the epidermal cell layer is located internal to {{the body and the}} gastrodermis is located externally. The embryo, larva and stolon are surrounded by a protective polyploid cell, which also functions in digestion. Just prior to host spawning, Polypodium everts to the normal position of cell layers, revealing tentacles scattered along the stolon. During eversion, the yolk of the host oocyte fills the gastral cavities of the parasite, supplying the future free-living stage with nutrients. Finally, upon emerging from the host egg in fresh water, the free-living stolon fragments into individual medusoid-like forms that go on to multiply by means of longitudinal fission, form sexual organs, and ultimately infect host fish with their gametophores.|$|R

40|$|The order Acipenseriformes {{comprises}} {{more than}} 20 species of <b>sturgeons</b> <b>and</b> {{two species of}} paddlefish worldwide. Extant Acipenseriformes are important {{in the study of}} evolutionary mechanisms and are potentially valuable in commercial aquaculture. The genome size in seven of the eight North American Acipenseriformes was de-termined by quantifying the DNA in erythrocytes using flow cytometry. Genome size ranged from 4. 6 to 13. 1 picograms. Three distinct groupings of genome size occur in an approximately 1 : 2 : 3 ratio, indicating ploidy differences between groups. Species with the smallest genomes are considered tetraploids of some ancestral fish and, therefore, 4 C. Our study supports the conclusion that the intermediate genome size consists of octaploid (8 C) -derived species and the largest genome is a dodecaploid (12 C) -derived species. Spontaneous triploids (3 N) of the lake <b>sturgeon,</b> Acipenser fulvescens, <b>and</b> the Gulf of Mexico sturgeon, A. oxyrhynchus desotoi, indicate that polyploidization mechanisms continue in the Acipenseriformes today.

The bottomland hardwood forest and cypress swamp are suffering from lack of fresh water input and sediment deposition owing to the levees upstream from the lake. In addition, bottomland hardwoods are being invaded by exotic species such as Chinese tallow while freshwater marshes are being invaded by exotic species such as elephant's-ear. The team also identified four key animal species that could indicate {{the degree to which}} the system declines or improves. These were rangia clam (representing lake bottom habitat), gulf <b>sturgeon</b> <b>and</b> <b>paddlefish</b> (representing fish communities) and the alligator snapping turtle (one of the largest freshwater turtles in the world, but in decline owing to over- harvesting). The future {{of the lake}} depends, in part, on restoring annual spring floods to the wetlands of the lake basin, and controlling urban sprawl on the North shore. Selected species, like the <b>paddlefish</b> <b>and</b> alligator snapping turtle, would benefit from reduced harvesting. The lake could change considerably without such conservation planning. A few examples of future change might include more cypress swamps converting to anthropogenic marsh or open water, Chinese tallow displacing native forests, and, with a warming climate, mangrove trees replacing brackish marsh.Hence, the ecosystems of the lake now, and in the future, depend very much upon some basic decisions about human activities in the vicinity of the lake, and, even more so, human activity upstream along the Mississippi River.|$|R
2500|$|Many Yangtze {{fish species}} have {{declined}} drastically and 65 were recognized as threatened in the 2009 Chinese red list. Among {{these are two}} that are considered entirely extinct (Anabarilius liui liui and Atrilinea macrolepis), two that are extinct in the wild (Anabarilius polylepis and Schizothorax parvus) and five that are critically endangered (Chinese paddlefish, Euchiloglanis kishinouyei, Megalobrama elongata, Schizothorax longibarbus and Leiocassis longibarbus). Additionally, both the [...] Yangtze <b>sturgeon</b> <b>and</b> Chinese <b>sturgeon</b> are considered critically endangered by the IUCN. The survival of these two sturgeon may rely on the continued release of captive bred specimens. The Chinese <b>sturgeon</b> <b>and</b> Chinese <b>paddlefish</b> are the largest fish in the river and among the largest freshwater fish in the world, reaching lengths of [...] and [...] respectively. Although listed as critically endangered rather than extinct by both the Chinese red list and IUCN, the continued survival of the Chinese paddlefish is questionable. Surveys conducted between 2006 and 2008 by ichthyologists failed to catch any, but two probable specimens were recorded with hydroacoustic signals. The last definite record was a [...] specimen caught during illegal fishing in 2007; despite attempts to keep it alive, it died shortly afterwards.|$|R
