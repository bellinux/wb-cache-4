5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, <b>so</b> <b>why</b> <b>should</b> I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E

In {{a letter}} to the editor of the Boston Globe written on January 8, 2012, Brown wrote, [...] "With out-of-control {{government}} spending and rising debt and deficits, politicians in Washington have proven time and time again that they cannot manage hard-earned taxpayer money responsibly. <b>So</b> <b>why</b> <b>should</b> we give them even more?" ...|$|E
500|$|A {{disagreement}} arose {{regarding the}} number of chemical weapons sites in contested areas of Syria, with the Syrian foreign minister stating that one-third of sites are in such areas. FSA official Louay Miqdad stated in early October {{that there were no}} chemical weapons in areas occupied by opposition forces, [...] "which is something that the Assad regime itself acknowledges, while these storehouses are also not located on the front, <b>so</b> <b>why</b> <b>should</b> we stop fighting?" [...] According to the OPCW chief, one abandoned site is in rebel-held territory and routes to others lead through rebel-held territory. Malik Ellahi of the OPCW states that few of the locations inspectors must visit will be difficult to access.|$|E

500|$|Some {{groups within}} the Christian metal {{movement}} have criticized bands within the industry for isolating the genre from general industry too avidly. For example, Christer Espevoll of Extol stated in 2003: [...] "I wish the scenes were more together. [...] For a long time {{there has been a}} huge – and still growing – distance between Christian and secular music industries. This is the situation peculiarly in the US but also in Scandinavia. In my opinion this kind of polarization is not a good thing. Music is first and foremost about music <b>so</b> <b>why</b> <b>should</b> every band or artist that represents a religion or lack of it have its own industry? Music has no religious borders." [...] However, most Christian bands today oppose to being isolated in the Christian music industry and have become mainstream successes, such as Virgin Black, and Norma Jean.|$|E
500|$|When {{she and the}} {{children}} finally get home, Marge is horrified to hear that Homer intends to never go to church again. She tries to persuade him otherwise, but to no avail. That night, Marge prays for her husband at their bedside. Homer tries to seduce her while she is doing so, but then falls asleep suddenly and has a dream in which God personally appears to him. God is furious with Homer for forsaking his church. Homer answers that [...] "I'm not a bad guy, I work hard, and I love my kids... <b>so</b> <b>why</b> <b>should</b> I spend half my Sunday hearing about how I'm going to hell?" [...] God agrees to let Homer worship in his own way. Homer starts following his own religion tailored to his personal tastes, including holidays he invents {{to get out of}} work.|$|E
500|$|After Lwaxana and Timicin {{spend an}} evening together, {{he tries to}} explain the custom of the Resolution. [...] He tells her that a fixed age had to be {{selected}} by the Kaelons because just randomly choosing a time to die would be heartless. Lwaxana finds the practice barbaric and refuses to accept the Kaelon tradition. [...] She tells Timicin how a Betazed woman on her planet successfully fought the tradition of wearing ornate wigs that contained live, captive birds. [...] It only took one courageous woman {{to step forward and}} end this cruel tradition. [...] Lwaxana also compares Timicin's plans to end his life with his research to save his star. If it is Timicin's time to die, Lwaxana argues, perhaps it is also time for his star to die as well, <b>so</b> <b>why</b> <b>should</b> he continue to try to prevent it? Timicin thinks about what Lwaxana has told him.|$|E

500|$|Not long thereafter, Hishammuddin himself apologised for his brandishing of the keris at {{the three}} {{previous}} UMNO annual general assemblies, saying he was sorry [...] "if it had affected the non-Malays". He {{refused to comment on}} whether he would repeat the act in the future. His conditional apology was met with heavy criticism from within UMNO; one media outlet described the reaction as such: [...] "The sentiment among many in the party is that the Chinese and Indians betrayed the BN when they voted for Pakatan Rakyat. There is hurt. There is anger. <b>So</b> <b>why</b> <b>should</b> Hishammuddin be too concerned about what non-Malays think of the keris act?" [...] Many felt that the apology itself threatened Malay supremacy. Abdullah welcomed the apology, saying it was brave and [...] "made it clear to the non-Malays the important role the keris had in the Malay community". In response to questions about the diminishing of Malay supremacy post-elections, he said that it was more about parity for the Bumiputra communities, rejecting the notion of political dominance: ...|$|E

2500|$|Jyotirao Phule (1827–1890) vehemently criticised any {{explanations}} {{that the}} caste system was natural and ordained by the Creator in Hindu texts. If Brahma wanted castes, argued Phule, {{he would have}} ordained the same for other creatures. There are no castes in species of animals or birds, <b>so</b> <b>why</b> <b>should</b> there be one among human animals. In his criticism Phule added, [...] "Brahmins cannot claim superior status because of caste, because they hardly bothered with these when wining and dining with Europeans." [...] Professions did not make castes, and castes did not decide one's profession. If someone does a job that is dirty, {{it does not make}} them inferior; {{in the same way that}} no mother is inferior because she cleans the excreta of her baby. Ritual occupation or tasks, argued Phule, do not make any human being superior or inferior.|$|E
2500|$|New York Times editor Dorothy J. Samuels {{invoked the}} cautionary adage [...] "be {{careful what you}} wish for", speculating that [...] "if owners {{indicate}} that they are not entirely separate from their corporation—by denying corporation employees' birth control coverage based on their personal religious beliefs—the case could be made in future state-court litigation that they have waived their right to be shielded from responsibility for corporate financial liabilities." [...] The dean of the UC Irvine School of Law, Erwin Chemerinsky, said, [...] "The liabilities of the corporation are not attributed to the owners, <b>so</b> <b>why</b> <b>should</b> the owners be able to attribute their beliefs to the company?" [...] Several legal scholars wrote an amicus brief to the Supreme Court for this case arguing this danger, while scholars on the other side counter that incorporated non-profit organizations enjoy liability protection despite their activities based on religious or other values/conscience-based causes.|$|E

2500|$|The first verse {{begins with}} Lopez singing, [...] "Nobody knows what I'm feeling inside. I find it so stupid <b>so</b> <b>why</b> <b>should</b> I hide that I love {{to make love}} to you baby." [...] The quick pace electro beat returns, revving up energy before Lopez goes into the chorus, [...] "I wanna dance and love and dance again." [...] Sara Gates of The Huffington Post said that the chorus line [...] "will surely get stuck in your head." [...] It has been {{suggested}} that the chorus was [...] "cheesy" [...] and weak, and ends up being [...] trumped by the pre-chorus, verses, overall production and fist-pumping beat. The song contains sexual innuendos, and Lopez sings the bridge with heartbreaking emotion. The song has been compared to Lopez's song [...] "Waiting For Tonight". Kyle Anderson from Entertainment Weekly noted that Pitbull's lyrics [...] "Can't even show love 'cause they'll sue ya" [...] was a reference to Lindsay Lohan suing him for using a reference to her without her consent in his song [...] "Give Me Everything" [...] (2011).|$|E
2500|$|Frank Williams gave Regazzoni {{his final}} drive in a {{competitive}} car alongside Alan Jones. The Williams FW07 proved to be very competitive, especially in the final part of the season, with FW07s winning {{all but two of}} the final six races of the 1979 calendar. The first win was for Regazzoni, at Silverstone, the first of over 100 victories for the Williams Grand Prix team. In deference to the team's Saudi sponsors, he celebrated on the podium with Lilt. However, despite his achievement, once again he was replaced by Carlos Reutemann {{at the end of the}} season. At the Italian Grand Prix, motor sport journalist Nigel Roebuck asked Regazzoni why he continued to drive at the age of 40, with no prospect of a competitive seat. Regazzoni replied, [...] "I love , and most of all I love to drive racing cars. <b>So</b> <b>why</b> <b>should</b> I stop when I feel this way?". At the end of the year he was invited to compete in the 1980 International Race of Champions, the last active Formula One driver, alongside Mario Andretti, to do so.|$|E
2500|$|A year later, Hashizume's boss aids him {{in opening}} his own restaurant, which he names [...] "Ida." [...] Kobayashi is {{accepted}} into the same college that Toyo is attending, and Toyo has passed the government test {{to work in the}} Ministry of Finance. Naru is continuing to get past her rejection. As more time passes, Hashizume's restaurant grows popular and he hires a single female assistant, Kaori. Ida grows uneasy about his being close to a beautiful woman until Hashizume points out that they are both gay, <b>so</b> <b>why</b> <b>should</b> he care. To ease Ida's mind further, he tells Kaori about him, which does not bother her at all. Two years after Toyo begins working at the Ministry of Finance, Kobayashi is now teaching world history at his old high school alongside Ida. After his supervisor asks him about his box lunches, Toyo demands Kobayashi stop making them out of fear someone will find out that he is gay. Work becomes so busy Toyo does not have time to call Kobayashi for forty days. When he finally has a free day coming up, he confesses to his supervisor that his [...] "girlfriend" [...] is a [...] "boyfriend", then goes to Kobayashi. After they make love, he tells Kobayashi he may quit. Kobayashi tells him he told his students on the first day that he was gay, and says that they cannot fire him from a public job just because he is homosexual. The next working day, Toyo asks his supervisor to [...] "gracefully and tactfully" [...] let people know he is gay. At the end of the series, Ida and Hashizume go to visit Ida's parents to [...] "come out" [...] to them. Kobayashi has already told his parents, and Naru promises to be Toyo's supporter when he's ready.|$|E
