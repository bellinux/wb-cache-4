5|$|During 1946–50, {{there were}} {{sporadic}} agitations against Hindi by the Dravidar Kazhagam (DK) and Periyar. Whenever the government introduced Hindi as a compulsory language in schools, anti-Hindi protests happened and succeeded in stopping the move. The largest anti-Hindi imposition agitations {{in this period}} occurred in 1948–50. After India obtained independence in 1947, the Congress Government at the Centre urged all states to make Hindi compulsory in schools. The Congress Government of Madras Presidency under Omandur Ramasamy Reddiar complied and made Hindi compulsory from the academic year 1948–49. It also introduced a minimum mark qualification in Hindi {{for the promotion of}} students to higher classes. Periyar once again launched an anti-Hindi imposition agitation. The 1948 agitation was supported by former Congress nationalists like M. P. Sivagnanam and Thiru. Vi. Ka, who recanted their earlier pro-Hindi policies. On 17 July, the DK convened an all party anti-Hindi conference to oppose the compulsory Hindi teaching. As in the agitation of 1938–40, this agitation was also characterized by strikes, black flag demonstrations and anti-Hindi processions. When Rajaji (then the Governor-General of India) visited Madras on 23 August, the DK staged a black flag demonstration protesting against his visit. On 27 August, Periyar and Annadurai were arrested. The Government did not change its position on Hindi and the agitation continued. On 18 December, Periyar and other DK leaders were arrested again. A compromise was reached between the government and agitators. The government stopped the legal action against the agitators and they in turn dropped the agitation on 26 December 1948. Eventually, the government made Hindi teaching optional from the academic year 1950–51. <b>Students</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not want to learn Hindi were allowed to participate in other school activities during Hindi classes.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyse the {{depression}} states of elementary school <b>students</b> <b>who</b> are in the second grade at school and do sports or not according to some variables. There are 251 <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> sports (amateur athletes,play in school teams etc.) at city center elementary schools of Malatya and there are 251 <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not sports in the analysing group so totally there are 502 students in the analysing group. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test has been applied to research datas and it has been seen that variables do not have a normal distribution at the end of test. So Mann Whitney U test has been used for the binary comparison and Kruskal Wallis test has been used for comparison more than two. α = 0. 05 has been determined as signifance level. While it has been found that there is a difference statistically at signifance level betweeen depression points of <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> sports (X= 12. 44) and depression points of <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not do sports (X= 14. 70); it has been found that there is not a difference at signifance level between branches and depression points of <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> sports. Additionally,it has been found that there is a difference statistically at signifance level between depression points of eighth grade <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> sports and eighth grade <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not sports; <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> sports and have 2001 TL, 3000 TL, 3001 TL and more family income status and <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not do sports and have same family income status; <b>students</b> <b>who</b> are 13, 14 or over years old also <b>do</b> sports and <b>students</b> <b>who</b> are at same ages also do not do sports. According to research findings,it has been seen that elementary school students have generally low depression points and <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> sports have low depression points at signifance level if they are compared with other <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not do sports. According to that result, elementary school students have been suggested to do sports to not have depression problems or to get over these depression problems...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} made {{with the aim of}} {{determining}} the effect of sport on tolerance level of secondary school students against themselves. A total of 400 students from the schools in city centre of Konya, of whom 200 do sports (100 boys and 100 girls) and 200 who don’t (100 boys and 100 girls) voluntarily participated in the study. Tolerant scale that was developed by Ersanlı in 2004, consisted of 30 items, was used to determine the participants’ tolerance level. In the evaluation of the obtained data SPSS for Windows 16 was used. After evaluating normal dispersion of the data and the homogeneous of the variances independent samples t test and One Way Anova were used to determine the significant differences and also in the differences between groups Tukey test was used. While no difference was observed in tolerance level against themselves of male secondary school <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> sport or not, significant difference was observed in the tolerance level of female <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> sport compared to female <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not (p< 0. 05). When all groups were considered {{there was a significant difference}} in the tolerance level against themselves of <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> sport compared to <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> not (p< 0. 05). There were no significant differences according to mother and father education status, age, level of income, number of sisters/brothers, there was a significant difference according to education class (p< 0. 05). According to study findings it can be said that <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> sports actively are more tolerant to theirselves and to their environments than the <b>students</b> <b>who</b> don’t <b>do</b> sports and the girl <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> sports are more tolerant to themselves and to their environments than the girl or boy <b>students</b> <b>who</b> don’t <b>do</b> sport...|$|R

25|$|Although it {{continued}} as a centre of clergy training until 1978, {{there was always}} a proportion of <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not intend to be ordained. The 1896 charter specifically stated that the college could accept anyone, regardless of whether they intended to take Holy Orders and, since 1925, it had been possible to study for a BA at the college without studying any theology at all. Throughout the college's history, non-ordinands had been in a minority. In the 1950s however, the number of ordinands declined sharply and the College faced possible closure unless it could secure government funding. Principal J.R. Lloyd Thomas did not spare himself in the fight for survival and, in 1960, after much negotiation, University College, Cardiff, agreed to sponsor Saint David's. Thus the government finally began to assist SDC financially.|$|E
25|$|The {{controversy}} {{followed the}} HKEAA's announcement in 2007 {{that if a}} candidate exceeded the word limit (500 words) in a task in Section E (Practical skills for work and study), anything written beyond the limit would not be marked. However, according to the marking guidelines issued the previous year, <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> so should be deducted only two marks from the style mark for doing so. That resulted in criticism by many students, who claimed that although the word limit instruction was stated in the paper, they were not clearly informed of the marking criteria and that the marking scheme the HKEAA adopted {{in the previous year}} gave them a misleading impression. The authority later stated that candidates should have read all instructions before attempting the questions. It also stated that candidates who followed the instructions strictly should be treated fairly.|$|E
25|$|A study {{conducted}} by Long claimed support for Cooper, Pruitt et al. {{in the use of}} personas. In a partially controlled study, a group of students were asked to solve a design brief; two groups used personas while one group did not. The students who used personas were awarded higher course evaluations than the group who did not. Students who used personas were assessed as having produced designs with better usability attributes than <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not use personas. The study also suggests that using personas may improve communication between design teams and facilitate user-focused design discussion. The study had several limitations: outcomes were assessed by a professor and students who were not blind to the hypothesis, students were assigned to groups in a non-random fashion, the findings were not replicated, and other contributing factors or expectation effects (e.g., the Hawthorne effect or Pygmalion effect) were not controlled for.|$|E
