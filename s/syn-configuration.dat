50|$|The {{combination}} of the <b>syn-configuration</b> of the methoxyimino moiety and the aminothiazolyl moiety confers extra stability to &beta;-lactamase enzymes produced by many bacteria. The N-methylpyrrolidine moiety increases penetration into Gram-negative bacteria. These factors increase the activity of cefepime against otherwise resistant organisms including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.|$|E
50|$|The <b>syn-configuration</b> of the methoxyoxime moiety confers {{resistance}} to beta-lactamase enzymes produced by many Gram-negative bacteria. The stability of this configuration results in increased activity of ceftriaxone against otherwise resistant Gram-negative bacteria. In {{place of the}} easily hydrolyzed acetyl group of cefotaxime, ceftriaxone has a metabolically stable thiotriazinedione moiety.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike β-lactams such as {{penicillin}} and amoxicillin, {{which are}} highly susceptible to degradation by β-lactamase enzymes (produced, for example, nearly universally by S. aureus), cefotaxime boasts the additional benefit {{of resistance to}} β-lactamase degradation due to the structural configuration of the cefotaxime molecule. The <b>syn-configuration</b> of the methoxyimino moiety confers stability against β-lactamases. [...] Consequently, the spectrum of activity is broadened to include several β-lactamase-producing organisms (which would otherwise be resistant to β-lactam antibiotics), as outlined below.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>syn-configuration</b> of the imino side chain, compared to other third-generation cephalosporins, the more complex moiety (containing two methyl and a carboxylic acid group) confers extra stability to β-lactamase enzymes produced by many Gram-negative bacteria. The extra stability to β-lactamases increases the activity of ceftazidime against otherwise resistant Gram-negative organisms including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The charged pyridinium moiety increases water-solubility. Ceftazidime shares the same variable R-group side chain with aztreonam, a monobactam antibiotic; the two drugs share a similar spectrum of activity, including activity against Pseudomonas.|$|E

In this regard {{it should be}} noted that the presently accepted configuration of α-benzildioxime (anti) was not proposed until 1921, and was not generally accepted until somewhat later.

40|$|The various {{methods of}} {{investigating}} the crystal structure of sinigrin {{have led to}} the determination of parameters for the potassium and sulfur atoms. The potassium parameters were found by the use of the Patterson function while the parameters of the sulfur atoms were found by the use of the Patterson function and Fourier projections. On considering the distance between the two sulfur atoms and after examination of the neighboring peaks on the Fourier projections, it is probably safe to assume that the two sulfur atoms are of the <b>syn-configuration.</b> This is in agreement with the proposed anti-configuration for the sulfate group and the migrating group as proposed by Lundeen and Ettlinger. The parameters for the potassium and sulfur atoms are listed in Table 2. Table 2 x y z K 149 724 942 S 360 745 655 S(SO 4) 775 575 918 Although the complete structure has not been found by the methods used so far, the computation of a three dimensional electron density function appears to be a very promising approach for resolving the structure completely...|$|E
40|$|Heteronuclear 2 -D and 3 -D magic-angle {{spinning}} NMR dipolar {{correlation spectroscopy}} {{was applied to}} determine solid-state 1 H shifts for aggregated bacteriochlorophyll c (BChl c) in uniformly 13 C-enriched light harvesting chlorosomes of the green photosynthetic bacterium Chlorobium tepidum. A complete assignment of 29 different observable resonances of the 61 protons of the aggregated BChl c in the intact chlorosomes is obtained. Aggregation shifts relative to monomeric BChl c in solution are detected for protons attached to rings I, II, and III/V and to their side chains. The 21 -H 3, 32 -H 3, and 31 -H resonances are shifted upfield by - 2. 2, - 1, and - 3. 3 ppm, respectively, relative to monomeric BChl c in solution. Although the resonances are inhomogeneously broadened and reveal considerable global structural heterogeneity, the 5 -CH and the 7 -Me responses are doubled, which provides evidence {{for the existence of}} at least two relatively well-defined structurally different arrangements. Ab initio quantum chemical modeling studies were performed to refine a model for the self-assembled BChl c with two different types of BChl stacks. The BChl in the stacks can adopt either anti- or <b>syn-configuration</b> of the coordinative bond, where anti and syn designate the relative orientation of the Mg-OH bond relative to the direction of the 17 - 171 bond. The analogy between aggregation shifts for BChl c in the chlorosome and for self-assembled chlorophyll a/H 2 O is explored, and a bilayer model for the tubular supra-structure of sheets of BChl c is proposed, from a homology modeling approach...|$|E
40|$|The {{condensation}} of enantiopure (1 R, 2 R) -(–) - 1, 2 -diaminocyclohexane {{with two}} equivalents of 2, 2 ′-bipyridine- 6 -carbaldehyde followed by reduction with NaBH 4 allows the facile {{synthesis of the}} enantiopure hexadentate ligand (R,R) - 3. Each tridentate metal-binding domain in (R,R) - 3 exhibits a degree of flexibility arising from inversion at the amine nitrogen centre and rotation about N–C and C–C single bonds. This leads {{to the formation of}} either M-[M{(R,R) - 3 }] 2 + or P-[M{(R,R) - 3 }] 2 +. The solid-state structures of the copper(II), iron(II) and zinc(II) complexes of (R,R) - 3 all show a preference for M-[M{(R,R) - 3 }] 2 +. In solution, [Fe{(R,R) - 3 }] 2 + exists predominantly as one diastereoisomer (assumed to be the M-form). The preference for the M- over P-form is rationalized in terms of a favourable anti configuration of the NH and cyclohexane- 1, 2 -diyl CH hydrogen atoms in the M-form, and an unfavourable <b>syn-configuration</b> in the P-form. When (R,R) - 4, the Schiff base analogue of (R,R) - 3, combines with zinc(II) or silver(I), [2 + 2] double helicates with M-chirality assemble in the solid state. With (S,S) - 4, iron(II) also assembles into a dinuclear, double helicate with M-handedness. Complete stereoselectivity is observed in solution with NMR spectroscopic data indicating the presence of one diastereoisomer. The preference for a dinuclear over mononuclear helicate can be traced to a decrease in ligand flexibility on going from 3 (saturated backbone) to 4 (unsaturated imine backbone) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemistry}} {{of a range}} of N-methyl- 1, 4 -dihydro- and 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydronaphthalen- 1, 4 -imines has been investigated. Inversion at nitrogen is slow in these amines and can be observed by 1 H nmr spectroscopy. The invertomer ratios of both series have been measured and, in each amine, the major invertomer has been assigned the <b>syn-configuration</b> (that with the N-methyl group syn- to the aromatic ring). On the basis of a comparative study, it was concluded that homoconjugative interaction of the lone pair and adjacent?-electrons is only a minor factor affecting the preferred configuration at nitrogen. The inversion barriers of the dihydronaphthalen- 1, 4 -imines have been measured and the values obtained gave further proof of the barrier-raising ability of the 7 -azabicyclo(2. 2. 1) heptadienyl group. The inversion barriers were found to vary slightly with the substituents on the aromatic rings but no clear reasons for this variation emerged. The members of both series of amines were quaternised with various alkylating agents. The ratios of the diastereoisomeric quaternary salts formed varied with the substituents on the aromatic rings. This variation was thought to be due to the prevailing electronic forces in view of the minimal steric differences between the amines in each series. The high inversion barriers (> 95 kJmol- 1) of N-chloro- 1, 4 -dihydro-naphthalen- 1, 4 -imines allowed the study of the separate chemistries of the two invertomers. At 0 °C with silver salts in methanol (conditions of negligible inversion), each invertomer solvolysed with assistance from adjacent ?-electrons. The structures and stereochemistries of the products reflected this assistance and further, the ability of the aryl group to participate in the heterolysis of the anti-N-C 1 bond varied predictably as a result of substitution with electron-withdrawing or releasing groups. The anti-invertomer rearranged to the novel 6, 7 -benzo- 1 -azabicyclo(3. 2. 0) hept- 3 -ene system. Under conditions of free inversion (ambient temperature, no silver salt), the products from the methanolyses reflected the relative reactivities of syn- and anti-invertomers. The less reactive invertomer (anti-) "reacted" only via prior inversion to the more reactive (syn-) ...|$|E
