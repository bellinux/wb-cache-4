5|$|A scientist, engineer, billionaire, {{founder and}} owner of Oscorp, who tests an {{unstable}} strength enhancer on himself and becomes the insane and powerful demon. Unaware of Spider-Man's true identity, he also <b>sees</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a father figure for Peter, ignoring his own son, Harry. Dafoe was cast as Osborn in November 2000, after Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich, and John Travolta turned down the role. Dafoe insisted on wearing the uncomfortable costume as he felt that a stuntman would not convey the character's necessary body language. The 580-piece suit took {{half an hour to}} put on.|$|E
5|$|Bran Stark is {{learning}} how to be the Lord of Winterfell while his older brother is away at war. He has a strange dream, where he <b>sees</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> Summer, his direwolf, running in the Godswood. The next morning, {{he goes to the}} Godswood with Osha, who tries to pry about his dreams, but Bran ignores her questions. The pair notice a red comet in the sky; Bran remarks that the men claim it is an omen of victory for one side or another in the war, but Osha insists it means one thing: dragons have returned.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "Faith and Reason" [...] {{series of}} twenty-four videos {{released}} in 2000 examines Dykes' theological views. The tapes quote Dykes as {{having said that}} Jesus Christ [...] "did not <b>see</b> <b>Himself</b> <b>as</b> the Son of God, He didn't <b>see</b> <b>Himself</b> <b>as</b> anything special." [...] In Scripture, however, Jesus said that He and the Father [...] "are one".|$|R

5|$|The exiled prisoners from Earth {{form the}} Confederacy of Man in the Koprulu Sector. A de facto plutocracy, the Confederacy's inner {{workings}} are elaborated {{on in the}} novels Liberty's Crusade, Speed of Darkness and Nova. Taking {{the role of the}} primary antagonistic faction in StarCrafts Episode I, the Confederacy is shown as the most powerful faction in the sector at the beginning of StarCraft; in the novels, it is depicted as being brutal towards the public and corrupt at the highest levels on its capital Tarsonis. The player gets to control a division of the Confederate Security Forces in the prequel shareware campaign for StarCraft. Due to the brutality of the regime, it is opposed by a variety of rebel groups and is eventually overthrown by the Sons of Korhal.

The Dominion is an autocracy with Mengsk as its emperor. The Dominion's operations are built on in The Dark Templar Saga series of novels. Although Mengsk <b>sees</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a benevolent dictator, he is shown to be just as harsh as his predecessors.|$|E
25|$|Edward is {{described}} in the book as being charming, polite, determined, and very stubborn. He is very protective over Bella and puts her safety, humanity and welfare before anything else. He often over-analyzes situations and {{has a tendency to}} overreact, especially in situations where Bella's safety is at risk. He retains some outdated speech from his human life in the early 20th century. Edward <b>sees</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a monster, and after falling in love with Bella, he desperately wishes that he were human instead of a vampire.|$|E
25|$|Chigurh kills without {{compassion}} or remorse, {{but always}} with deliberation. He {{is described as}} having his own set of morals, however twisted they may be. While he does not kill at random or without purpose, his reasons are at times abstract. He <b>sees</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a hand of fate; an instrument who exacts what is supposed to happen upon those he sees accountable. He gives many of his victims he faces a chance to survive by making deals either personally, or by flipping coins in making decisions. In the novel, he is depicted as having {{a great deal of}} endurance, such as being capable of withstanding pain from multiple shotgun blasts or from a fractured arm.|$|E

When they make it back to the pawn shop, Merida shows up to shoot arrows at Belle, saying that he can't resist the magic.

After she gets out, Belle tells Gold that he still a coward and walks away.

500|$|The idea of {{conflict}} {{between good and evil}} is one that is touched upon in the book in a light hearted manner. Although Artemis <b>sees</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> an evil genius {{at the beginning of the}} book, and is portrayed as such, the end of the story contradicts this image when he pays the fairies to help his mother. Artemis' enemies, the fairies, would be [...] "the good side", but their actions call this view into questionâ€”they are as determined as Artemis is, to achieve their goals, and while only some of them are willing to ruthlessly deploy a troll, regardless of the possible danger to life, all are willing to utilize a bio-bomb once Holly is out of the mansion to force Artemis into submission.|$|E
500|$|Economically, Morales' {{policies}} have sometimes been termed [...] "Evonomics" [...] and {{have focused on}} creating a mixed economy. Morales' presidential discourse has revolved around distinguishing between [...] "the people", of whom he <b>sees</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> a representative, and the oppressive socio-economic elite and the old political class, whom he believes have mistreated [...] "the people" [...] for centuries. Morales sought to make Bolivia's representative democracy more direct and communitarian, through the introduction of referendums and a citizen-led legislative initiative. George Philip and Francisco Panizza claimed that like his allies Correa and ChÃ¡vez, Morales should be categorized as a populist, because he appealed [...] "directly to the people against their countries' political and economic order, divided the social field into antagonistic camps and promised redistribution and recognition in a newly founded political order." ...|$|E
500|$|The series {{revolves}} around its title character and his various friends.

Originally from Kirigakure, {{his goal is to}} claim all of the swords wielded by the Seven Swordsmen of the Mist, and from there reform the {{organization}} in memory of his late brother Mangetsu, who was a member himself. Although his dream was initially cut short by Orochimaru, after Sasuke freed him he managed to claim Zabuza's sword, but lost it while battling the Kage. Suigetsu tends to have a sadistic personality, constantly fascinating about cutting things and consequently getting on Karin's nerves, yet <b>sees</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> normal in comparison to most other people. His clan has the ability to turn any part of their body into water, but must stay hydrated to do so. Suigetsu is voiced by Takashi Kondo in Japanese and by Grant George in the English dub except in Rock Lee and His Ninja Pals, where he is voiced by Todd Haberkorn.|$|E
500|$|Baynham {{told the}} Guardian that [...] "despite {{the fact that}} people say he's awful, {{a lot of the time}} we were trying to build empathy: you're {{watching}} a man suffer but also at some level identifying with his pain." [...] Felicity Montagu, who plays Partridge's assistant Lynn, felt he was a good person [...] "deep down" [...] and actually [...] "vulnerable and lovable". Iannucci said that Partridge stays optimistic because he never <b>sees</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> others see him, and that despite his failings was [...] "the perfect broadcaster for these times, when there are 24 hours to fill and dead time is a crime â€“ he has a unique capacity to fill any vacuum with his own verbal vacuum." [...] Rob and Neil Gibbons felt that by the time of Mid Morning Matters, when Partridge is working for an even smaller radio station, he was more at peace with himself and that his lack of self-awareness saved him from misery.|$|E
500|$|Bart <b>sees</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> King David, {{who kills}} Goliath, {{but has not}} won the war yet: Nelson is Goliath II, Goliath's son. Goliath II has killed Methuselah (Grampa), David's oldest friend in revenge. In retaliation, David {{challenges}} Goliath II, but having no stones to sling at him, David loses and is catapulted from the city. David then meets Ralph, a shepherd, who claims he can kill Goliath II. Ralph dies, which enrages David even more. He then trains to try to slay Goliath. Having to climb up the enormous Tower of Babel beforehand, David manages to kill Goliath by throwing a lit lantern down his throat. Goliath is surprisingly still alive, but is quickly killed by Ralph's gravestone, hurled by Ralph himself, who also had not died. Much to his shock, David is sent to jail as the townspeople claim that Goliath was the best King they ever had, building roads, libraries and hospitals. The dream ends with a title card that reads [...] "A Bart Simpson Dream".|$|E

500|$|In {{his way to}} the Lost Valley {{to learn}} more about the {{expedition}} Yuma sent after the Relic, Ajay's helicopter is shot down by an unknown assailant. Ajay survives the crash, but awakens to discover that the pilot has been abducted and taken deeper into the valley. Ajay follows him intent on rescue, only to discover that the valley is occupied by an aggressive army. Liberating a relay station in a bid to re-establish contact with the Golden Path, he is forced to fight off wave after wave of attackers whilst being taunted by a voice over the radio. Investigating further, Ajay discovers the army is calling themselves the Disciples of Yalung, and is a cult worshiping a demon from Kyrati mythology. The Disciples have harnessed an evil that permeates the valley to transform their followers into [...] "Awakened", or yetis, and are amassing their forces to attack Kyrat. Realizing that he cannot return to Kyrat without dealing with the cult, Ajay gradually destroys their ranks before scaling a glacier to find the source of Yalung's influence. After successfully destroying a tree that provides the Disciples with their power, Ajay <b>sees</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> an Awakened, although this is supposedly just a hallucination.|$|E
500|$|The Supreme is also {{revealed}} to be power-crazed in other ways. Michiko Kakutani writes [...] "Francia, it seems, wants to account for everything (his own history, {{as well as the}} history of his nation, which he personifies as its leader) as he pours out his story, it becomes clear that he possesses an insatiable desire for power and controlâ€”he has even chained a huge meteorite to his desk, as punishment for being a cosmic runawayâ€”and that he also <b>sees</b> <b>himself</b> <b>as</b> two separate beings: as a conniving, paranoiac [...] "I", beset by the average ego's fears and doubts, and as the [...] "Supreme", a monstrously powerful presence that even Francia himself must refer to in the third person." [...] The Supreme was personally involved in the affairs of the state to such extent, that it was reported by contemporary press that [...] " [...] personally trained his cavalry {{in the use of the}} saber, ascertained the exact number of nails in Fort Orange, awarded 102 pesos to a Frenchman whose anchor had been melted down by the state... lowered the price of salt in the capital, donated state yerba to the people of Saladillo, and denied permission for [...] to marry in Villa Rica."
