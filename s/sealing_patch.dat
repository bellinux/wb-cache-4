40|$|Abstract Introduction Nonoperative {{management}} (NOM) of hemodynamically stable {{patients with}} blunt hepatic injuries {{is considered the}} current standard of care. However, it is associated with several in-hospital complications. In selected cases laparoscopy could be proposed as diagnostic and therapeutic means. Case report A 28 years-old male was admitted in the Emergency Unit following a motor vehicle crash. CT-scan showed an isolated stade II hepatic injury {{at the level of}} the segment IV. Firstly a NOM was decided. Laparoscopic exploration was then performed at day 4 due to a biliary peritonitis. Intraoperative trans-cystic duct cholangiography showed a biliary leaks of left hepatic biliary tract, involving sectioral pedicle to segment III. Cholecystectomy, trans-cystic biliary drainage, application of surgical tissue <b>sealing</b> <b>patch</b> and abdominal drainage were performed. Postoperative outcome was uneventful, with fast patient recovery. Conclusion Laparoscopy has gained a role as diagnostic and therapeutic means in treatment of complications following NOM of blunt liver trauma. This approach seems feasible and safety, with satisfactory postoperative outcome. </p...|$|E
30|$|A special {{point of}} {{interest}} of this case concerns the choice between ERCP and early surgery. ERCP with ampullary sphincterotomy and biliary stent insertion {{was reported to be}} highly successful in controlling biliary leak. However, in the large series of Anand et al., the mean hospital length of stay after ERCP therapy was 33  days ±[*] 21  days and the closure of the fistula was obtained not earlier than 47  days on average [8]. The requirement to repeat the ERCP procedures with stent exchange before the definite fistula closure is reported in the literature [2, 8]. Essentially, neither the optimal duration of leak before ERCP nor the duration of leak before operative consideration has been studied in the literature [3]. In this case, the bile contaminated the entire abdominal cavity; thus, it {{has been found to be}} necessary to perform at least a lavage and an additional drainage to prevent the development of devastating systemic consequences of biliary peritonitis. Although laparotomy remains an option, lavage and drainage can be safely and effectively performed by laparoscopy [9, 10]. Laparoscopic lavage in combination with trans-cystic biliary drainage and application of surgical tissue <b>sealing</b> <b>patch</b> on the bile leak has been reported in the literature; however, that patient was hospitalized for as long as 18  days after surgery [10]. Actually, the therapeutic decision in our case has been based on the elimination of the bile source and accomplished by laparoscopic anatomical resection of the injured left lateral section of the liver. A bile leak from the segment 4 b was controlled by laparoscopic suturing. Importantly, no additional invasive therapy was required and the benefit of surgery was evident by the patient’s early recovery in the absence of any complications.|$|E

40|$|Mechanical {{stimulation}} of voltage-clamped Xenopus oocytes by inflation, aspiration, or local indentation failed to activate {{an increase in}} membrane conductance {{up to the point}} of causing visible oocyte damage. The absence of mechanosensitivity is not due to the vitelline membrane, rapid MG channel adaptation or tension-sensitive recruitment of new membrane. Membrane capacitance measurements indicate that the oocyte surface area is at least 5 times larger than that predicted assuming a smooth sphere. We propose that this excess membrane area provides an immediate reserve that can ‘buffer’ membrane tension changes and thus prevent MG channel activation. High-resolution images of tightly <b>sealed</b> <b>patches</b> and patch capacitance measurements indicate a smooth membrane that is pulled flat and perpendicular across the inside of the pipette. Brief steps of pressure or suction cause rapid and reversible membrane flexing and MG channel activation. We propose that changes in membrane geometry induced during cell growth and differentiation or as a consequence of specific physiological and pathological conditions may alter mechanosensitivity of a cell independently of the intrinsic properties of channel proteins...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{kinetics}} of 9 -aminoacridine (9 -AA) {{block of}} single Na channels in neuroblastoma N 1 E- 115 cells were studied using the gigohm <b>seal,</b> <b>patch</b> clamp technique, under the {{condition in which}} the Na current inactivation had been eliminated by treatment with N-bromoacetamide (NBA). Following NBA treatment, the current flowing through individual Na channels was manifested by square-wave open events lasting from several to tens of milliseconds. When 9 -AA {{was applied to the}} cytoplasmic face of Na channels at concentrations ranging from 30 to 100 /M, it caused repetitive rapid transitions (flickering) between open and blocked states within single openings of Na channels, without affecting the amplitude of the single channel current. The histograms for the duration of blocked states and the histograms for the duration of open states could be fitted with a single-exponential function. The mean open time (To) became shorter as the drug concentration was increased, while the mean blocked time (Tb) was concentration independent.

40|$|International audienceUrban sprawl {{causes the}} sealing of lands {{closest to the}} urban centers by {{transforming}} productive agricultural fields into impervious areas, with numerous economic, social and environmental impacts. Integrated monitoring is important to help urban policies and urban sprawl modelling, proposing urban sprawl indicators with combining spatial and social aspects of the phenomenon by spatial operators in GIS. For that, geographical information of <b>sealing</b> <b>patches</b> and territorial social data are used, but spatial uncertainties {{and their impact on}} the detection of indicator changes are usually ignored. The paper proposes (1) to evaluate uncertainties of indicator spatial and (2) to analyze the effect of upscaling on these uncertainties. The method used proposes to create impervious polygons according to their measured geometric and thematic uncertainties using a Monte Carlo simulation approach and to simulate social data according to census uncertainties. Impervious polygons are used in a closing operation, with different radius values, required to map morphological urban areas. The case study focused on three indicators (area, dispersion coefficient and population density) of the morphological urban areas for four administrative levels of administrative territorial units of Languedoc-Roussillon region, France. Results show that indicator uncertainties are generally higher for less densely populated areas than for the others at the finest territorial level, that the closing radius had a slightly influence on indicator uncertainties, and that uncertainties decreases with the upper territorial entities...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which external Ca ions block sodium channels were studied by a gigaohm <b>seal</b> <b>patch</b> clamp method using membranes excised from N 1 E- 115 neuroblastoma cells. Tetramethrin was used to prolong the open time of single channels so that the current-voltage relationship could be readily determined {{over a wide range}} of membrane potentials. Comparable experiments were performed in the absence of tetramethrin. Increasing external Ca ions from 0. 18 to 9. 0 mM reduced the single channel conductance without causing flickering. From the dose-response relation the dissociation constant for Ca block at 0 mV was estimated to be 32. 4 +/- 1. 05 mM. The block was intensified by hyperpolarization. The voltage dependence indicates that Ca ions bind to sodium channels at a site located 37 +/- 2 % of the electrical distance from the outside. The current increased with increasing external Na concentrations but showed a saturation; the concentration for half-maximal saturation was estimated to be 185 mM at - 50 mV and 204 mM at 0 mV. A model consisting of a one-ion pore with four barriers and three wells can account for the observations that deviate from the independence principle, namely, the saturation of current, block by Ca ions, and rectification in current-voltage relationship. The results suggest that the Ca-induced decrease of the macroscopic sodium current results from a reduced single sodium channel conductance...|$|R

40|$|The pup {{production}} of the Greenland Sea populations of hooded and harp seals were assessed in aerial surveys using two aircrafts for reconnaissance flights and photographic surveys along transects over the whelping areas from 14 March to 3 April 2007. One helicopter, operated from the applied expedition vessel, flew reconnaissance flights, monitored the distribution of <b>seal</b> <b>patches</b> and performed age-staging of the pups. The total estimate of hooded seal pup production was 16 140 (SE = 2 140, CV = 13. 3 %), {{which is similar to}} an estimate obtained for comparable surveys in 2005. The total pup production estimate obtained for harp seals was 110 530 (SE = 27 680, CV = 25. 0 %), which is slightly higher than an estimate obtained for a similar survey in 2002. The pup production and the uncertainty of the pup production estimate were estimated using a standard method for analyzing this type of survey data and a recently developed method that utilized Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). Using the two estimation methods on data from all three surveys (2002, 2005, 2007), comparable estimates of pup production were obtained. In scenarios where pups were clustered, the estimated uncertainty of the pup production estimate was much lower for the GAM method than for the conventional method.

40|$|The {{simplest}} cell-like structure, the {{lipid bilayer}} vesicle, {{can respond to}} mechanical deformation by elastic membrane dilation/thinning and curvature changes. When a protein is inserted in the lipid bilayer, an energetic cost may arise because of hydrophobic mismatch between the protein and bilayer. Localized changes in bilayer thickness and curvature may compensate for this mismatch. The peptides alamethicin and gramicidin and the bacterial membrane protein MscL form mechanically gated (MG) channels when inserted in lipid bilayers. Their mechanosensitivity may arise because channel opening {{is associated with a}} change in the protein 2 ̆ 7 s membrane-occupied area, its hydrophobic mismatch with the bilayer, excluded water volume, or a combination of these effects. As a consequence, bilayer dilation/thinning or changes in local membrane curvature may shift the equilibrium between channel conformations. Recent evidence indicates that MG channels in specific animal cell types (e. g., Xenopus oocytes) are also gated directly by bilayer tension. However, animal cells lack the rigid cell wall that protects bacteria and plants cells from excessive expansion of their bilayer. Instead, a cortical cytoskeleton (CSK) provides a structural framework that allows the animal cell to maintain a stable excess membrane area (i. e., for its volume occupied by a sphere) in the form of membrane folds, ruffles, and microvilli. This excess membrane provides an immediate membrane reserve that may protect the bilayer from sudden changes in bilayer tension. Contractile elements within the CSK may locally slacken or tighten bilayer tension to regulate mechanosensitivity, whereas membrane blebbing and tight <b>seal</b> <b>patch</b> formation, by using up membrane reserves, may increase membrane mechanosensitivity. In specific cases, extracellular and/or CSK proteins (i. e., tethers) may transmit mechanical forces to the process (e. g., hair cell MG channels, MS intracellular Ca 2 + release, and transmitter release) without increasing tension in the Lipid bilayer...|$|R

The mean open time (tau o) became shorter as the drug concentration was increased, while the mean blocked time (tau b) was concentration independent. The association (blocking) rate constant, kappa, calculated from the slope of the curve relating the reciprocal mean open time to 9 -AA concentration, showed little voltage dependence, the rate constant being on the order of 1 X 10 (7) M- 1 s- 1. The dissociation (unblocking) rate constant, l, calculated from the mean blocked time, was strongly voltage dependent, the mean rate constant being 214 s- 1 at 0 mV and becoming larger as the membrane being hyperpolarized. The voltage dependence suggests that a first-order blocking site is located at least 63 % of the way through the membrane field from the cytoplasmic surface. The equilibrium dissociation constant for 9 -AA to block the Na channel, defined by the relation of l/kappa, was calculated to be 21 microM at 0 mV. Both tau - 1 o and tau - 1 b had a Q 10 of 1. 3, which suggests that binding reaction was diffusion controlled. The burst time in the presence of 9 -AA, which is the sum of open times and blocked times, was longer than the lifetime of open channels in the absence of drug.

Leak currents were generated by the weakening of gigaohm <b>patch</b> <b>seals</b> by artificial membrane rupture using the ZAP function on the patch clamp amplifier. Surprisingly, we found that leak currents generated from the weakened membrane/glass seal can be surprisingly stable and exhibit behavior that is consistent with a sodium leak current derived from an expressible channel. Leaky patch currents differing by 10 fold in size were similarly reduced in size when external sodium ions were replaced with the large monovalent ion NMDG+. Leaky patch currents increased when external Ca 2 + (1. 2 mM) was lowered to 0. 1 mM and were inhibited (. 40 % to. 90 %) with 10 mM Gd 3 +, 100 mM La 3 +, 1 mM Co 2 + or 1 mM Cd 2 +. Leaky patch currents were relatively insensitive (, 30 %) to 1 mM Ni 2 + and exhibited a variable amount of block with 1 mM verapamil and were insensitive to 100 mM mibefradil or 100 mM nifedipine. We hypothesize that the rapid changes in leak current size in response to changing external cations or drugs relates to their influences on the membrane seal adherence and the electro-osmotic flow of mobile cations channeling in crevices of a particular pore size in the interface between the negatively charged patch electrode and the lipid membrane.

If the ionic strength in the bath solution is reduced from 160 mM to 95 mM, single-channel activity is initiated in cell-attached <b>patches</b> <b>sealed</b> before permeabilization. Conductance is outwardly rectifying with approximately 17 pS at negative and 57 pS at positive potentials. Single-channel currents reverse near the calculated equilibrium potential for Cl-. The averaged current shows inactivation at positive potentials. The current is blocked by 5 -nitro- 2 -(3 -phenylpropylamino) -benzoic acid (NPPB). An increase in ionic strength reversibly inhibits current activation. It is concluded that a decrease in ionic strength activates single-channel currents through VRAC rather than shifting the set point of a hypothetical volume sensor. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Sealing {{materials}} {{that can be}} applied and left in place in vacuum over a wide range of temperatures (especially temperatures of a few thousand degrees Celsius) have been conceived and investigated for potential utility in repairing thermal-protection tiles on the space shuttles in orbit before returning to Earth. These materials are also adaptable to numerous terrestrial applications that involve vacuum processing and/or repair of structures that must withstand high temperatures. These materials can be formulated to have mechanical handling characteristics ranging from almost freely flowing liquid-like consistency through paste-like consistency to stiff puttylike consistency, and to retain these characteristics in vacuum until heated to high curing temperatures. A sealing material of this type can be formulated to be used in any of several different ways for example, to be impregnated into a high-temperature-fabric patch, impregnated into a high-temperature-fabric gasket for <b>sealing</b> a <b>patch,</b> applied under a patch, or applied alone in the manner of putty or wallboard compound. The sealing material must be formulated to be compatible with, and adhere to, the structural material(s) to be repaired. In general, the material consists of a vacuum-compatible liquid containing one or more dissolved compound(s) and/or mixed with suspended solid particles. Depending on the intended application, the liquid can be chosen to be of a compound that can remain in place in vacuum for a time long enough to be useful, and/or to evaporate or decompose in a controlled way to leave a useful solid residue behind. The evaporation rate is determined by proper choice of vapor pressure, application of heat, and/or application of ultraviolet light or other optical radiation. The liquid chosen for the original space shuttle application is a commercial silicone vacuum-pump oil...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project is to study current practices in enhancing visibility and protection of highway maintenance vehicles involved in moving operations such as snow removal and shoulder operations, crack <b>sealing,</b> and pothole <b>patching.</b> The results will enable the maintenance staff to adequately assess the applicability and impact of each strategy to their use and budget. The report’s literature review chapter examines the use of maintenance vehicle warning lights, retroreflective tapes, shadow vehicles and truck-mounted attenuators, and advanced vehicle control systems, {{as well as other}} practices to improve visibility for both snowplow operators and vehicles. The chapter concludes that the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices does not specify what color or kind of warning lights to use. Thus, a wide variety of lights are being used on maintenance vehicles. The study of the relevant literatures also suggests that there are no clear guidelines for moving work zones at this time. Two types of surveys were conducted to determine current practices to improve visibility and safety in moving work zones across the country and in the state of Iowa. In the first survey o...|$|R
40|$|Chronic cranial windows {{have been}} {{instrumental}} in advancing optical studies in vivo, permitting long-term, high-resolution imaging in various brain regions. However, once a window is attached {{it is difficult to}} regain access to the brain under the window for cellular manipulations. Here we describe a simple device that combines long term in vivo optical imaging with direct brain access via glass or quartz pipettes and metal, glass, or quartz electrodes for cellular manipulations like dye or drug injections and electrophysiological stimulations or recordings while keeping the craniotomy sterile. Our device comprises a regular cranial window glass coverslip with a drilled access hole later sealed with biocompatible silicone. This chronic cranial window with access port is cheap, easy to manufacture, can be mounted just as the regular chronic cranial window, and is self-sealing after retraction of the pipette or electrode. We demonstrate that multiple injections can be performed through the silicone port by repetitively bolus loading calcium sensitive dye into mouse barrel cortex and recording spontaneous cellular activity over a period of weeks. As an example to the extent of its utility for electrophysiological recording, we describe how simple removal of the silicone <b>seal</b> can permit <b>patch</b> pipette access for whole-cell patch clamp recordings in vivo. During these chronic experiments we do not observe any infections under the window or impairment of animal health...|$|R
40|$|The kinetic {{properties}} {{of a single}} Na+ channel in the tunicate egg cell membrane were studied by the patch-recording technique. A conventional micropipette filled with a solution of 600 mM NaCl and 1. 5 mM MnCl 2 {{was used as the}} <b>patch</b> electrode. The <b>seal</b> resistance between <b>patch</b> electrode and egg surface was more than 1000 M omega. In the patch recording, the current fluctuations at a given membrane potential consisted of pulse-like events of a uniform amplitude. The amplitude was 1 pA at - 56 mV and decreased as the membrane potential was made more positive. It is suggested that the fluctuation in the patch current is the current through a single Na+ channel for the following reasons. First, the reversal potential of the pulse-like fluctuation in the patch current was approximately equal to that of the total membrane Na+ current in a solution equivalent to that in the patch electrode. Second, the charges transferred by the patch current and by the total membrane Na+ current during a 170 -msec command pulse showed parallel dependence on membrane potential. Third, the kinetic {{properties of}} the pulse-like fluctuations in the patch current were analyzed according to the Hodgkin-Huxley model, and it was shown that the time sequences of the pulse-like events were compatible with those for a single Na+ channel...|$|R
