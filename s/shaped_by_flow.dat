40|$|A brief {{description}} of the potential occupational health hazards encountered in the manufacture of plastics (polymers) is given. In general, these hazards are due to the monomers used to make the various plastics, to unreacted monomer contained within the finished products, and to the fillers, stabilizers, pigments, inhibitors, and initiators used in fabricating the finished products. They run the gamut from angiosarcomas of the liver due to vinyl chloride, to dermatitis and asthma-like reactions due to the initiators used with epoxy resins. It is impossible, in the time allotted today, to describe for you in any detail all of the occupational and environmental health hazards of plastics. At best, all we can hope to do is outline some of the more obvious ones in a general way. I have previously reviewed this topic in more detail (1). We might start by defining a plastic as "a material that contains as an essential ingredient an organic substance of large molecular weight, is solid in its finished state, and, at some stage in its manufacture or in its processing into finished articles, can be <b>shaped</b> <b>by</b> <b>flow</b> " (2). In many cases, the terms plastic and resin are used in an overlapping sense. However, strictly speaking, a resin is the more or less homogeneous polymer used as the starting material in the production of a molded article, while plastic signifies the finished product which may contain fillers, plasticizers, stabilizers, pigments, etc. In general, the principal hazards of plastics are associated with their monomers and with the plasticizers, stabilizers, "activators, " fillers, and pigments that are used in them. Although there are exceptions to this, this statement generally holds true. Of course, the hazard we are all most acutely aware of today is that of liver angiosarcom...|$|E

One remarkable result is the absence of an epidemic threshold in infinite-size scale-free networks, which implies that any infection will perpetually propagate regardless of the spreading rate.

In this chapter we will provide with two new approaches to cope with the problem of concurrency and traffic in the spread of epidemics.

40|$|River systems, {{such as the}} Columbia River in the Pacific Northwest, USA {{have been}} {{influenced}} by human activities, resulting in changes to the physical processes that drive landform evolution. This work describes an inventory of landforms along the Columbia River estuary between the Pacific Ocean and Bonneville Dam in Oregon and Washington. Groupings of landforms are assigned to formative process regimes that are used to assess historical changes to floodplain features. The estuary was historically a complex system of channels with a floodplain dominated by extensive tidal wetlands in the lower reaches and backswamp lakes and wetlands in upper reaches. Natural levees flank most channels in the upper reaches, locally including areas of ridge and swale topography and crevasse splays that intrude into backswamps. Other Holocene process regimes affecting floodplain morphology have included volcanogenic deltas, tributary fans, dunes, and landslides. Pre-Holocene landforms are locally prominent and include ancient fluvial deposits and bedrock. Historical changes to streamflow regimes, floodplain isolation by flood-control systems, and direct anthropogenic disturbance have resulted in channel narrowing and limited the amount of floodplain that can be <b>shaped</b> <b>by</b> <b>flowing</b> water. Floodplain isolation has caused relative subsidence of tidal floodplains along much of the lower estuary.

One remarkable result is the absence of an epidemic threshold in infinite-size scale-free networks, which implies that any infection will perpetually propagate regardless of the spreading rate. The vast majority of current theoretical approaches assumes that infections are transmitted as a reaction process from nodes to all neighbors. Here we adopt a different perspective and show that the epidemic incidence is <b>shaped</b> <b>by</b> traffic <b>flow</b> conditions. Specifically, we consider the scenario in which epidemic pathways are defined and driven <b>by</b> <b>flows.</b> Through extensive numerical simulations and theoretical predictions, it is shown that the value of the epidemic threshold in scale-free networks depends directly on flow conditions, in particular on the first and second moments of the betweenness distribution given a routing protocol. We consider the scenarios in which the delivery capability of the nodes is bounded or unbounded. In both cases, the threshold values depend on the traffic and decrease as flow increases. Bounded delivery provokes the emergence of congestion, slowing down the spreading of the disease and setting a limit for the epidemic incidence. Our results provide a general conceptual framework to understand spreading processes on complex networks.

This thesis evaluates the interference of TCP flow control on ATM forum's proposal on traffic <b>shaping</b> <b>by</b> means of simulation. The influence of the TCP sliding window on the ATM traffic is observed by simulating in a certain environment. Models are presented which make it possible to observe pure TCP traffic resp.

The Singapore Girl figure illuminates how feminine subjectivities have been shaped within and for the postcolonial nation-state. I argue here that this process is never purely domestic; the state’s preoccupation with conscripting women’s bodies, labour and identities into the service of meeting national goals and objectives is always conducted with reference to broader international considerations. It is this dual influence of international processes and national gender politics that has, for a large number of Singapore women, worked to circumscribe political activity and reinforce essentialist understandings of gendered behaviour.

While many ceramic filter factories manufacture flowerpot-shaped filters, PHW has transitioned from the flowerpot shape, to a paraboloid shape, and finally to a hemispheric filter shape. The PHW factory conducts flow-rate testing {{as part of their}} quality control process and has documented a wide range of flow rates for the hemispheric filter as compared to the global standard. This thesis uses finite-element groundwater-flow modeling software to develop models of flow through three different ceramic filter shapes: flowerpot, paraboloid, and hemispheric filters. A sensitivity analysis was then conducted for each filter <b>shape</b> <b>by</b> simulating <b>flow</b> through the filter for a range of hydraulic conductivities. It was found that the hemispheric filter shape produces a higher flow rate than the flowerpot filter for a given hydraulic conductivity, and that the flow rate through the hemispheric filter is more sensitive to changes in hydraulic conductivity. by Anna C.

Modernist areas as the Western Garden Cities in Amsterdam are also ambiguous spaces, their form <b>shaped</b> mainly <b>by</b> <b>flowing</b> open space. The ambiguity of space is related to its organisation, if the territorial order is missing, urban space tends to become non-legible. Recent fieldwork in Amsterdam showed that more businesses than assumed are located in this large area, which was planned and is generally still thought of as widely separated in functions. The infiltration with new businesses took also place at locations that were not used by businesses before. The changing use of built material changes partially also the territorial depth. Businesses can currently be found in four different types of territorial depth regarding the distance from the public street to the individual user unit, creating sometimes even more overlap between public and private.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade or so Salafism has become one of the West s new {{political}} bogey-men. Many regard the movement as the antechamber of violent groups such as al-Qaeda, and as the by-product of a centralized foreign-policy platform <b>shaped</b> <b>by</b> so-called Saudi interests. Based on extensive research conducted throughout Yemen between 2001 and 2009, and particularly in the southern province of Yâfi, this book offers an original approach to Salafism and draws a necessary counter-narrative that takes into account the dynamics of the Salafi movement as well as its relationship to its evolving environment, either local, regional and international. Having studied over a hundred recorded sermons and conferences and dozens of books, and carried out interviews with numerous clerics, intellectuals and activists, Laurent Bonnefoy focuses on the allegedly apolitical Salafi doctrine promoted by the renowned Yemeni Salafi figure, Muqbil al-Wadi'i, who died in 2001. Building on IR theory and political sociology, he references the everyday practices of al-Wadi'i's dedicated followers, their rivalries as well as their own evolving trajectories. He demonstrates that, rather than resulting from specifically planned policies, Yemeni Salafism has, since the early 1980 s, evolved through a series of spontaneous, grassroots mechanisms, many of which are <b>shaped</b> <b>by</b> transnational <b>flows,</b> that embed this movement in the complex Yemeni context.

40|$|The atmospheres of cool main-sequence {{stars are}} {{structured}} <b>by</b> convective <b>flows</b> from the convective envelope that penetrate the optically thin layers {{and lead to}} structuring of the stellar atmospheres analogous to solar granulation. The flows have considerable influence on the 3 D structure of temperature and pressure and affect the profiles of spectral lines formed in the photosphere. For the set of six 3 D radiative (M) HD simulations of cool main-sequence stars described in the first paper of this series, we analyse the near-surface layers. We aim at describing the properties of granulation of different stars and at quantifying the effects on spectral lines of the thermodynamic structure and flows of 3 D convective atmospheres. We detected and tracked granules in brightness images from the simulations to analyse their statistical properties, {{as well as their}} evolution and lifetime. We calculated spatially resolved spectral line profiles using the line synthesis code SPINOR. To enable a comparison to stellar observations, we implemented a numerical disc-integration, which includes (differential) rotation. Although the stellar parameters change considerably along the model sequence, the properties of the granules are very similar.

However, natural flows are usually made of grains of more complex shape. We {{have studied the}} influence of this <b>shape</b> <b>by</b> comparing the <b>flow</b> down an inclined plane of two kinds of aggregates, well rounded and very angular. For both materials, we have measured the stopping and starting height {{as a function of}} the inclination, and the de-pendencies of the flow rate on the height and inclination. We have observed noticeable differences (up to a factor of two for the flow rate). The usual scaling of the Froude number {{as a function of the}} ratio of flowing to stopping height works well (with a significant decrease of the velocity near jamming), and provides nearly identical curves for the two kinds of aggregates. Those experiments show the validity of the rheological law for a large class of materials. ...|$|R

The {{core of this}} study consists of field research conducted from 2005 - 2006. Personal narratives, photographs, maps, and illustrations drawn from first-person experience construct an account of a neglected layer of the city. Political and economic reforms since the late 1970 s initiated {{the formation of a}} new subaltern class in contemporary Chinese cities known as the floating population. Millions of migrants have flowed through China’s uneven economic landscape in pursuit of the Chinese Dream. There is an estimated 4 million migrants actively contributing to the construction of new Beijing, yet the subalterns are excluded from official State representations that focus on the monumental. Without proper household registration (hukou) status, rural migrants have little to no access to social welfare including subsidized housing. Migrants have, of necessity, developed unconventional habitats in the capital city. In the absence of officially sanctioned space, migrants seek shelter within cracks and fissures of the formal system.

Here, as in other countries and regions, the aim of integrating science and technology into sports is now a leading sports policy principle and innovation strategy. Building on science and technology studies (STS) tools and methods (vision assessment, multi-site ethnography, foresight), the paper draws out the ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI) induced {{by the use of}} new sciences and technologies in sports.

40|$|International audienceExtreme flood {{events are}} characterised by very high discharges, {{potentially}} exceeding 10 ^ 6 m^ 3 /s, over {{a short period}} of time. They can result from varied causes including landslide dam failure, glacial lake outbursts, subglacial volcanic eruptions and powerful typhoons. While these events are rare on a human timescale, they are common over geological time. During these events, the energy transferred to the land surface has the potential to significantly modify the shape of the landscape. Understanding and quantifying the impact of such events is thus crucial to understand the genesis and evolution of landscapes that bear the evidence of <b>shaping</b> <b>by</b> <b>flowing</b> fluids, in either terrestrial or extra-terrestrial contexts. This study aims to constrain the amounts, spatial distribution and processes of bedrock erosion during extreme flood events using three complementary approaches: topographic analysis, terrestrial cosmogenic nuclide (3 He, 21 Ne) dating and experimental analogue modelling. The Jökulsá á Fjöllum is a major river that flows north from the Vatnajökull icecap, Iceland. This river has experienced numerous outburst floods, termed 'jökulhlaups', of varying magnitude during the Holocene, the largest one reaching a modelled peak discharge of ~ 0. 9 x 10 ^ 6 m^ 3 /s. The route of Jökulsá á Fjöllum, particularly the Jökulsárgljúfur gorge system and Ásbyrgi, a large dry canyon (3 km long, ~ 0. 5 km wide, up to 90 m deep), exhibits numerous topographic features that testify to the action of such extreme flood events. Detailed topographic survey of the gorge and landforms associated with the jökulhlaups, such as cataracts, mega-dunes and scablands, combined with the dating of abandoned strath terrace surfaces will allow quantification of the amount and spatial distribution of erosion during jökulhlaups and thus give some insight into the mechanisms of gorge formation and knickpoint migration. Different strath terrace surfaces within the Jökulsárgljúfur gorge correspond to the tops of different basalt lava units; the surface exposure ages will determine whether the different knickpoints corresponding to these terrace levels migrated simultaneously during the flood events or whether each terrace level represents a given flood event. Samples are being processed at GFZ Potsdam at the time of writing and ages are expected for November 2013. A complementary experimental study has been designed to define the influence of a series of parameters on the dynamics of gorge formation in a controlled environment. Simulations will be run using a silica-paste bedrock flume at Géosciences Rennes in November 2013. Patterns of erosion, landform morphology and knickpoint dynamics will be compared to those of the natural object in Iceland to define the control exerted by the following factors on gorge formation: flow regime, initial bedrock slope, pre-existence of knickpoint within the system, sediment availability and the heterogeneity of the bedrock substrate...|$|R

Network {{analysis was used to}} map and reveal the pattern of connections between states as <b>shaped</b> <b>by</b> bilateral tourism <b>flows.</b> Data were provided by the United Nations World Tourism Organization. For several countries, we updated and integrated UNWTO data with information available from the national statistical office of the individual countries. For the year 2012, results obtained from the UNWTO record-based network were compared to geo-located Twitter data as a proxy of human mobility patterns. Our analysis provides evidence of a shift towards an increased homogeneity in the travelling preferences of European tourists, an acquired attitude of visitors to travel shorter distances, and a tendency of mobility patterns to merge. Finally, the comparison between UNWTO and Twitter data shows a different spatial distribution of visitors. These results provide a useful insight for policy makers involved in tourism planning...|$|R
