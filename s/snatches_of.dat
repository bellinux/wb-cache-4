5|$|The {{resistance}} was alerted {{to carry out}} these tasks by messages personnels transmitted by the BBC's French service from London. Several hundred of these messages, which might be <b>snatches</b> <b>of</b> poetry, quotations from literature, or random sentences, were regularly transmitted, masking the few that were actually significant. In the weeks preceding the landings, lists of messages and their meanings were distributed to resistance groups. An increase in radio activity on 5 June was correctly interpreted by German intelligence to mean that an invasion was imminent or underway. However, because of the barrage of previous false warnings and misinformation, most units ignored the warning.|$|E
5|$|The common {{starling}} is a noisy bird. Its song {{consists of}} a wide variety of both melodic and mechanical-sounding noises as part of a ritual succession of sounds. The male is the main songster and engages in bouts of song lasting for a minute or more. Each of these typically includes four varieties of song type, which follow each other in a regular order without pause. The bout starts with a series of pure-tone whistles and these are followed by the main part of the song, a number of variable sequences that often incorporate <b>snatches</b> <b>of</b> song mimicked from other species of bird and various naturally occurring or man-made noises. The structure and simplicity of the sound mimicked is of greater importance than the frequency with which it occurs. In some instances, a wild starling has been observed to mimic a sound it has heard only once. Each sound clip is repeated several times before the bird moves on to the next. After this variable section comes a number of types of repeated clicks followed by a final burst of high-frequency song, again formed of several types. Each bird has its own repertoire with more proficient birds having a range of up to 35 variable song types and as many as 14 types of clicks.|$|E

25|$|The character's {{difficult}} ethical history, and {{the character}} himself, were laid to rest by DC in its year-long weekly title, 52, in which Sage recruits and trains Gotham ex-cop Renee Montoya as his replacement before dying of lung cancer. In this incarnation he is wry, cheerful and avuncular, although still enigmatic. He displays no discernible philosophical commitments, aside from a determination to recruit Montoya and to have her decide who she is and who she will become. Montoya is herself agonized {{over the issue of}} killing criminals, although her guilt is over a principled refusal to kill one, specifically the murderer of her former partner. The series' action chiefly alternates between Gotham City, where Montoya struggles to save Kate Kane from Intergang and its Crime Bible cult, and Nanda Parbat, where she trains with Sage's mentors Rodor and Dragon, and whence she later returns with Sage, too late to find him a cure for his cancer. En route there, Sage dies muttering <b>snatches</b> <b>of</b> conversations from his early comics appearances and a final invocation to Montoya to decide who she will become. After grieving, she determines to take up his mantle as the new Question.|$|E

500|$|The show also {{features}} slang {{not used in}} contemporary culture, such as adaptations of modern words, or new words altogether. For example, [...] "shiny" [...] is frequently used {{in a similar manner}} as the real world slang [...] "cool", and [...] "gorram" [...] is used as a mild swear word. Written and spoken Chinese as well as Old West dialect are also employed. As one reviewer noted: [...] "The dialogue tended to be a bizarre purée of wisecracks, old-timey Western-paperback patois, and <b>snatches</b> <b>of</b> Chinese".|$|E
500|$|... "Down Town" [...] is, {{like most}} of Drummond and Cauty's work of 1987, a social {{critique}} of Great Britain realised as house music. [...] Its central theme is social exclusion, poverty and homelessness, in which <b>snatches</b> <b>of</b> Clark's [...] "Downtown"—an awestruck ode to hedonistic city nightlife—are juxtaposed with raps by Drummond, wailing sirens and original choral gospel vocals full of Christmas optimism, provided by the London Community Gospel Choir. [...] These disparate elements are held together by a beatbox rhythm, a bassline borrowed from [...] "Axel F", and an accompaniment of piano and Hammond organ.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of Kids Can Say No! have {{generally}} been negative, with initial reviews doubting the benefit of showing the film to children and later reviews focusing on Harris' hypocrisy. In a 1985 Times review, Caroline Moorehead writes that the film's avoidance of an explicit discussion of sexual abuse was both a requirement and the film's greatest weakness. According to Moorehead, an explicit discussion might have terrified children and prevented parents from consenting to their children's viewing of the film; however, its oblique approach prevents children from understanding the issue. She calls the film's theme song [...] "catchy, one of those irritating <b>snatches</b> <b>of</b> music {{that is hard to}} forget".|$|E

500|$|Wordsworth did {{not reveal}} the {{inspiration}} for the character of Lucy, and over the years the topic has generated intense speculation among literary historians. Little biographical information can be drawn from the poems—it is difficult even to determine Lucy's age. In the mid-19th century, Thomas DeQuincey (1785–1859), author and one-time friend of Wordsworth, wrote that the poet [...] "always preserved a mysterious silence on the subject of that 'Lucy', repeatedly alluded to or apostrophised in his poems, and I have heard, from gossiping people about Hawkshead, some <b>snatches</b> <b>of</b> tragic story, which, after all, might be an idle semi-fable, improved out of slight materials." ...|$|E

500|$|Burger's Daughter took Gordimer {{four years}} to write, {{starting}} {{from a handful of}} what she called [...] "very scrappy notes", [...] "half sentences" [...] and [...] "little <b>snatches</b> <b>of</b> dialogue". Collecting information for the novel was difficult because at the time little was known about South African communists. Gordimer relied on clandestine books and documents given to her by confidants, and her own experiences of living in South Africa. Once she got going, she said, writing the book became an [...] "organic process". The Soweto riots in 1976 happened while she was working on the book, and she changed the plot to incorporate the uprising. Gordimer explained that [...] "Rosa would have come back to South Africa; that was inevitable", but [...] "here would have been a different ending". During those four years she also wrote two non-fiction articles to take breaks from working on the novel.|$|E
500|$|Craig Manning of AbsolutePunk {{called it}} [...] "the biggest leap of faith," [...] {{describing}} it as [...] "a trippy patchwork of EDM and pop that pays loving tribute to Lavigne’s sizable Japanese following."

[...] Laurence Green from musicOMH {{called it a}} [...] "trashy EDM moment; laced with <b>snatches</b> <b>of</b> Japanese lingo," [...] pointing out that it [...] "feels like a weird misstep more suited to a Britney Spears album than the predominantly rock-centric sounds present {{on the rest of}} the record." [...] A reviewer from Sputnikmusic remarked that [...] "Hello Kitty" [...] is [...] "laughably bad" [...] and [...] "insipid", and criticized Lavigne's attempt at trying to draw in a younger crowd.

500|$|According to O'Neill, {{the film}} is an [...] "intersection of fact and hallucination". It is set inside the {{decaying}} halls of the closed Ambassador Hotel, former home to the Cocoanut Grove restaurant and the first Academy Awards ceremonies. The film superimposes reenactments of classic Hollywood films onto shots of the dilapidated establishment, with ghostly gangsters and their gun molls interacting with icy blondes and wisecracking bartenders in carefully deconstructed <b>snatches</b> <b>of</b> dialogue. O'Neill's time-lapse photography lends the film an ethereal effect that serves an intentionally distancing purpose. In this study of the historic Hollywood edifice, there is no discernible plot {{and there are no}} recurring characters. The film construction has the appearance of snippets taken from lost films of the 1940s; it uses surreal vignettes of nude men and women, stop-motion animated mannequin torsos, flickering film projections and dim light bulbs to create what devolves in a sense of nightmares, giving a result that feels more like an art installation than the expected film.|$|E

500|$|Biographers Blundy and Lycett {{believed}} that he was [...] "a populist at heart." [...] He enjoyed attending lengthy public sessions where people were invited to question him; these were often televised. Throughout Libya, crowds of supporters would arrive at public events where he appeared. Described as [...] "spontaneous demonstrations" [...] by the government, there are recorded instances of groups being coerced or paid to attend. He was typically late to public events, and would sometimes fail to arrive. Although Bianco {{thought he had a}} [...] "gift for oratory", he was considered a poor orator by biographers Blundy and Lycett. Biographer Daniel Kawczynski noted that Gaddafi was famed for his [...] "lengthy, wandering" [...] speeches, which typically involved criticizing Israel and the U.S. The journalist Ruth First described his speeches as being [...] "an inexhaustible flow; didactic, at times incoherent; peppered with <b>snatches</b> <b>of</b> half-formed opinions; admonitions; confidences; some sound common sense, and as much prejudice".|$|E
500|$|When King Lear {{played at}} the Old Vic in 1970, reviews were mixed; J.W. Lambert thought that the [...] "grey sets" [...] and Hordern's [...] "grizzled" [...] costume were how Shakespeare would have {{intended}} them to be, while Eric Shorter thought otherwise, stating [...] "I still do not understand those costumes." [...] Of the performance, the dramatist and critic Martin Esslin called Hordern's portrayal [...] "a magnificent creation" [...] before going on to say: [...] "Hordern's timing of the silences from which <b>snatches</b> <b>of</b> demented wisdom emerge is masterly and illuminates the subterranean processes of his derangement." [...] Writing for The Times later that year, the theatre critic Irving Wardle described Hordern's Lear as a [...] "sharp, peremptory pedant; more a law-giver than a soldier, and (as justice is an old man's profession) still {{in the prime of}} his life". Hordern played Lear once more that decade, in 1975, which was televised by the BBC for their series Play of the Month.|$|E
500|$|British critic Leslie Halliwell {{states the}} film's {{influence}} as [...] "it {{led directly to}} all the kaleidoscopic swinging London spy thrillers and comedies of the later sixties". In particular, the visuals and storyline are credited with inspiring The Monkees' television series. The [...] "Can't Buy Me Love" [...] segment borrowed stylistically from Richard Lester's earlier The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film, {{and it is this}} segment, in particular using the contemporary technique of cutting the images to the beat of the music, which has been cited as a precursor of modern music videos. Roger Ebert goes even further, crediting Lester for a more pervasive influence, even constructing [...] "a new grammar": [...] "he influenced many other films. Today when we watch TV and see quick cutting, hand-held cameras, interviews conducted on the run with moving targets, quickly intercut <b>snatches</b> <b>of</b> dialogue, music under documentary action and all the other trademarks of the modern style, we are looking at the children of A Hard Day's Night". In an interview for the DVD re-release of A Hard Day's Night, Lester said he had been labelled the father of MTV and had jokingly responded by asking for a paternity test.|$|E
