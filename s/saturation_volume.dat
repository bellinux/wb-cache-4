40|$|ABSTRACT: There {{has been}} a recent push towards {{adoption}} of the in-place soil stiffness {{as a means of}} assessing compactness of pavement geomaterials. Based on a series of low-strain GeoGaugeTM stiffness measurements made under controlled laboratory conditions on compacted silts, the variation of stiffness with water content, dry unit weight, degree of <b>saturation,</b> <b>volume</b> change upon wetting, shear strength and soil plasticity is discussed. In general, the Geo-GaugeTM stiffness is not directly related to dry unit weight, peaks dry of optimum and decreases upon wetting. Soil specimens having a large stiffness also tend to be stronger but they also tend to swell more upon wetting implying that the shrink/swell potential is not optimized if stiffness is. These results help advance the understanding of the role of stiffness in assessing compact-ness of cohesive geomaterials. TRB 2003 Annual Meeting CD-ROM Paper revised from original submittal...|$|E

40|$|The main {{motivations for}} {{developing}} a multimodal control are {{to ensure the safety}} and efficiency of the vulnerable modes which are often not recognized in the conventional control strategies. The developed control has some new features such as an exclusive phase for the pedestrians, a protected left-turning phase for the bicyclists and an inclusion of them in the actuation process et cetera. The green time adjustment uses vehicles' headways for executing the actuation process. The considered infrastructure has detectors for the bicycles and they can take part in the actuation process which is rarely found in real practice till now. The control itself is fully actuated and tested till half of the <b>saturation</b> <b>volume</b> (1000 per hour) for a single lane. The waiting time at the signalized intersection is considered as a measure for evaluating the performance and the developed control is compared with a reference control. The reference control replicates the multimodal nature of current practices for urban traffic control. As the control is of fully independent nature, it’s not possible to use the conventional synchronization techniques applied in pre-timed control. However, an idea for partial synchronization is implemented for the major arterial flow with working coordination around 60 % probabilities. A certain priority rule is established for the buses which are running in the major arterial with two opposite routes. The developed multimodal control seems quite promising to deal with modal diversity and the results from the simulation studies provide such evidence...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{mathematical}} theory for water movement through a swelling porous medium {{has been developing}} {{for a number of}} years, experimental testing and verification of that theory has been limited, especially for unsaturated media. The intent of the present research was to test, and modify if necessary, this existing theory. Experimentally, water was applied to the top end of an initially air-dry column of swelling soil (50 % bentonite clay and 50 % quartz silt), with the top end allowed to rise upward as swelling occurred. A narrowly collimated beam of dual-energy gamma rays was employed to measure the soil bulk density and water content nondestructively, within the column, over a time period of 1 to 2 wk. ^ It was found necessary to extend the existing theory, by considering the soil void ratio to be a function of both fractional water <b>saturation</b> (<b>volume</b> of water per unit pore volume) and time. This also introduced an auxiliary time dependence into the water diffusivity function. Furthermore, to allow for an experimentally feasible boundary condition, the governing differential flow equation was recast in terms of the fractional water saturation. A mathematical solution of the flow problem was sought and found in terms of product-form separation of variables. Some early-time departure from square-root-of-time dependence was found. Also, measurements within the soil column were employed in {{the mathematical}} solution to predict the cumulative water absorption and the upward rise of the top end of the swelling soil column. These predicted values were in reasonable agreement with experimental values obtained outside the soil column by direct observation. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the most important}} element of operational performance of roundabout traffic intersections in Rourkela on capacity analysis. The movements of the vehicles were observed at 5 roundabouts along ring road in Rourkela. Gap acceptance and follow up time were estimated for cars for one hour analysis. The relation between a roundabout performance measure and capacity is expressed in terms of degree of <b>saturation</b> (<b>volume</b> – Capacity ratio). The capacity analysis is done based on gap acceptance method that is adopted by Tanner based on the HCM 2010. The traffic movement data with vehicle characteristics were collected from 5 roundabouts in Rourkela. These 5 roundabouts are directly related to their approach leg numbers. Tanner models use the gap-acceptance theory (or critical headway) to simulate the behaviour of entering vehicles and vehicles circulating within the roundabout. Current research work on roundabout models mostly concentrates on determining the capacity of an approach based on the entering and circulating flows. Approach capacity is calculated as a mathematical function of critical headway and follow-up headway. The Tanner model is based on gap- acceptance theory with gap-acceptance parameters. The Highway Capacity Manual (HCM 2010) roundabout tanner capacity model is an analytical (exponential regression) model with clear basis in gap-acceptance theory. The NCHRP Report 572 model is based on empirical exponential regression) capacity model with no explicitly. Capacity analysis results indicated that out of 5 roundabouts 1 of them has greater than 0. 85 degree of saturation and this roundabout has critical for traffic flow because this has degree of saturation more than 0. 85...|$|E
40|$|The {{incorporation}} of brown algae into biopolymer beads or foams for metal sorption {{has been previously}} reported. However, the direct use of these biomasses for preparing foams is a new approach. In this study, two kinds of porous foams were prepared by ionotropic gelation using algal biomass (AB, Laminaria digitata) or alginate (as the reference) and applied for Pb(II) sorption. These foams (manufactured as macroporous discs) were packed in filtration holders (simulating fixed-bed column) and the system was operated in either a recirculation or a one-pass mode. Sorption isotherms, uptake kinetics and sorbent reuse were studied in the recirculation mode (analogous to batch system). In the one-pass mode (continuous fixed-bed system), the influence of parameters such as flow rate, feed metal concentration and bed height were investigated on both sorption and desorption. In addition, the effect of Cu(II) on Pb(II) recovery from binary solutions was also studied {{in terms of both}} sorption and desorption. Sorption isotherms are well fitted by the Langmuir equation while the pseudo-second order rate equation described well both sorption and desorption kinetic profiles. The study of material regeneration confirms that the reuse of the foams was feasible with a small mass loss, even after 9 cycles. In the one-pass mode, for alginate foams, a slower flow rate led to a smaller <b>saturation</b> <b>volume,</b> while the effect of flow rate was less marked for AB foams.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{progressive}} hypoxia {{on the structure}} and dynamics of herring (Clupea harengus) schools in laboratory conditions was investigated. The length, width and depth of schools of about 20 individuals were measured from video recordings {{to test the hypothesis}} that during hypoxia fish schools change their shape and volume. School shape (calculated as the ratios of length/depth, width/depth and length/width) did not change significantly during hypoxia. School length, width, depth, area and volume were all significantly increased at 20 % oxygen <b>saturation.</b> <b>Volume,</b> area and width were more sensitive to hypoxia; volume and width were also increased at 25 % and area at 30 % oxygen saturation. The degree of position changing (shuffling) of individuals within the school was also analysed. Shuffling in normoxia was observed to occur largely through 'O-turn' manoeuvres, a 360 (degrees) turn executed laterally to the school that allowed fishes in the front to move to the back. O-turn frequency during normoxia was 0. 69 O-turns fish(- 1) min(- 1) but significantly decreased with hypoxia to 0. 37 O-turns fish(- 1) min(- 1) at 30 % oxygen saturation. Shuffling was also investigated by measuring the persistence time of individual herring in leading positions (i. e. {{the first half of the}} school). No significant changes occurred during hypoxia, indicating that the decrease in O-turn frequency does not affect shuffling rate during hypoxia, and that position shuffling in hypoxic conditions is mainly due to overtaking or falling back by individual fishes. School integrity and positional dynamics are the outcome of trade-offs among a number of biotic factors, such as food, predator defence, mating behaviour and various physical factors that may impose certain limits. Among these, our results indicate that oxygen level modulates schooling behaviour. Oxygen alters whole-school parameters at oxygen saturation values that can be encountered by herring in the field, indicating that oxygen availability is an important factor in the trade-offs that determine school volume. An increase in school volume in the wild may increase the oxygen available to each individual. However, shuffling rate is not affected by hypoxia, indicating that the internal dynamics of positioning is the result of the balance of other factors, for example related to the nutritional state of each individual fish as suggested by previous studies...|$|E

30|$|Sandstone {{reservoir}} {{performance is}} affected by many factors including the depositional parameters of grain size and type of sorting, and diagenetic processes such as cementation and compaction (Cade et al. 1994). Whether a formation has good or poor reservoir quality largely depends on the petrophysical parameters such as porosity and permeability (Schlumberger 1989). Porosity {{is the amount of}} void spaces within a rock, which can be in-filled by hydrocarbons. Permeability {{is a measure of the}} ability of fluid to travel around the void spaces. Petrographical and sedimentological analyses help support the petrophysical findings. Of particular importance in reservoir units is diagenesis. This includes processes such as compaction, dissolution, clay authigenesis, cementation and mineral replacements, which contribute to physical and chemical alterations of the rocks, and may therefore enhance or impede their reservoir quality. A comprehensive understanding of reservoir quality and characterization is improved with a qualitative and quantitative well log analysis. Through well log interpretation, important petrophysical parameters such as total and effective porosities, water and hydrocarbon <b>saturations,</b> <b>volume</b> of shale and resistivity values can be achieved. Moreover, a formation can be narrowed down into reservoir and net pay zones for great analytical conclusions. Using these three analyses, the objective of this paper in achieving a thorough reservoir quality study is accomplished.|$|R

30|$|Subsurface {{applications}} of nanoparticles {{are not limited}} to drilling and oil recovery alone. There is also the use of nanoparticles in characterizing reservoir properties and heterogeneities. Bypassed oil can easily be identified using superparamagnetic nanoparticles as a contrast agent in an oil reservoir. This allows for the accurate determination of oil saturation in a reservoir (Avendano et al. 2012; Rahmani et al. 2015). Furthermore, the stability of the magnetic nanoparticles in suspension under high salinity and temperature is further enhanced through surface functionalization. The use of electromagnetic measurements can be used to track and monitor the injection of such nano-suspension in a reservoir over time. According to Bennetzen and Mogensen (2014), nanoparticles can be engineered to be stimuli-responsive based on reservoir conditions. Nanoparticles can be made to respond to changes in reservoir pressure and temperature, oil saturation, shear rate, etc. Agenet et al. (2012) examined the application of fluorescent gold–silica nanoparticle tracers for in situ real-time optical detection. The nanoparticles were engineered such that its size (30 – 100  nm) allowed for the encapsulation of glowing dyes, which forms the intrinsic signal of tracers and an interface with the environment for functionalization. The authors showed that the tracers based on fluorescent nanoparticles could act as sensitive probes of physicochemical state in terms of pH, temperature, salt content, oil <b>saturation,</b> <b>volume,</b> etc., of an oil reservoir. The sensitivity of the prepared nanoparticles was due to their adaptability to monitoring setup, stability in conditions of high salinity, and their fluorescence coding. The authors demonstrated the practical applicability of the fluorescent tracers through core flooding experiments with the easy propagation of nanoparticles and minor adsorption recorded. Rahmani et al. (2013) propagated stable suspensions of superparamagnetic nanoparticles in porous reservoir medium and investigated its response to a Croswell magnetic system. The authors used the underlying principle that the nanoparticles have the capability of changing the magnetic permeability of the flooded region, thereby enhancing the imaging of the flooding process. The consequence of this is the easy identification of reservoir heterogeneity through the illumination of flooded paths and fronts. The advantage of using such superparamagnetic nanoparticles compared to conventional tracers lies in the easy detection of the nanoparticles before breakthrough at the observatory well (Bennetzen and Mogensen 2014). Furthermore, the easy detection of the superparamagnetic nanoparticles makes real-time monitoring while chemical tracers have to be obtained from the reservoir and transported for laboratory analysis.|$|E

The study objectives were to evaluate petrophysical parameters (net-pay thickness, porosity, water <b>saturation</b> and <b>volume</b> of shale) and estimate area extent of all hydrocarbon bearing sands from subsurface mapping and seismic interpretation. The workflow procedures for analysis involved the delineation of six hydrocarbon bearing sands (A, B, C, D, E and F) and {{the determination of}} petrophysical parameters from three well logs, while the 3 -D seismic interpretation involved picking of three growth faults (A, B and C) as well as three antithetic faults(D, E and F).

The last two broadband inverted volumes were projected to Chi angles corresponding to the target petrophysical parameters, and three broadband EEI volumes were obtained. At well control points, the linear trends based on specific lithology between EEI and petrophysical parameters were then used to transform EEI volumes into quantitative porosity, water <b>saturation,</b> and shale <b>volume</b> cubes. In order to obtain the reservoir facies distribution, another concept of minimum energy angle was used to generate the background EEI cube, thereby enabling the mapping of reservoir facies.

The solubility of HNIW in solvent-antisolvent mixtures was measured at 30 °C and these data were fitted to a generalized solubility curve. Recrystallization experiments were conducted at 30 °C {{in the case of}} <b>saturation</b> with the <b>volume</b> ratio of ethyl acetate to petroleum ether (chloroform) ranging from 0 : 1 to 4 : 1. Desensitized HNIW was obtained by ethyl acetate and petroleum ether crystallization and characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscop...|$|R
40|$|International audienceABSTRACT This paper briefly reviews {{development}} of the electron channelling contrast imaging (ECCI) technique, which uses diffraction contrast to reveal dislocation structures underlying the surface of bulk samples imaged in the scanning electron microscope. In particular the application of ECCI {{to the study of}} evolution of dislocation structures during cyclic deformation of single crystal copper samples will be described. Quantitative measurements of the vein width, separation and volume fraction within the matrix phase were made and these parameters showed rapid changes during the initial cyclic hardening of the sample, with smaller variations continuing after stress <b>saturation.</b> The <b>volume</b> fraction of persistent slip bands (PSBs) increased continuously with cycling beyond stress saturation. Measurements of PSB widths and spacings indicated that new PSBs tend to form near existing PSBs. The ECCI technique revealed PSBs of finite length with tapered ends. Stress concentrations occurring ahead of the tapered PSBs may be the cause of preferential nucleation of new PSBs close to existing ones...|$|R
