5|$|The homological mirror {{symmetry}} conjecture of Maxim Kontsevich {{states that}} the derived category of coherent <b>sheaves</b> on one Calabi–Yau manifold is equivalent {{in a certain sense}} to the Fukaya category of its mirror. This equivalence provides a precise mathematical formulation of mirror symmetry in topological string theory. In addition, it provides an unexpected bridge between two branches of geometry, namely complex and symplectic geometry.|$|E
5|$|The derived {{category}} of coherent <b>sheaves</b> is constructed using tools from complex geometry, {{a branch of}} mathematics that describes geometric curves in algebraic terms and solves geometric problems using algebraic equations. On the other hand, the Fukaya category is constructed using symplectic geometry, a branch of mathematics that arose from studies of classical physics. Symplectic geometry studies spaces equipped with a symplectic form, a mathematical tool {{that can be used}} to compute area in two-dimensional examples.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Edward Witten {{introduced}} topological string theory, {{a simplified}} version of string theory, and physicists {{showed that there}} is a version of mirror symmetry for topological string theory. This statement about topological string theory is usually taken as the definition of mirror symmetry in the mathematical literature. In an address at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1994, mathematician Maxim Kontsevich presented a new mathematical conjecture based on the physical idea of mirror symmetry in topological string theory. Known as homological mirror symmetry, this conjecture formalizes mirror symmetry as an equivalence of two mathematical structures: the derived category of coherent <b>sheaves</b> on a Calabi–Yau manifold and the Fukaya category of its mirror.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} case is when X is {{a scheme}} and O its structure <b>sheaf.</b> If O is the constant <b>sheaf</b> , then a <b>sheaf</b> of O-modules {{is the same}} as a <b>sheaf</b> of abelian groups (i.e., an abelian <b>sheaf).</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{algebraic}} geometry, a reflexive <b>sheaf</b> is {{a coherent}} <b>sheaf</b> that is isomorphic to its second dual (as a <b>sheaf</b> of modules) via the canonical map. The second dual {{of a coherent}} <b>sheaf</b> is called the reflexive hull of the <b>sheaf.</b> A basic example of a reflexive <b>sheaf</b> is a locally free <b>sheaf</b> and, in practice, a reflexive <b>sheaf</b> is {{thought of as a}} kind of a vector bundle modulo some singularity.

5|$|In the B-model of topological string theory, the D-branes {{are complex}} submanifolds of a Calabi–Yau {{together}} with additional data that arise physically from having charges at the endpoints of strings. Intuitively, one {{can think of}} a submanifold as a surface embedded inside the Calabi–Yau, although submanifolds can also exist in dimensions different from two. In mathematical language, the category having these branes as its objects is known as the derived category of coherent <b>sheaves</b> on the Calabi–Yau. In the A-model, the D-branes can again be viewed as submanifolds of a Calabi–Yau manifold. Roughly speaking, they are what mathematicians call special Lagrangian submanifolds. This means among other things that they have half the dimension of the space in which they sit, and they are length-, area-, or volume-minimizing. The category having these branes as its objects is called the Fukaya category.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{was already}} {{obsolete}} {{by the time}} it had been completed, as European military design had moved beyond curved bastions, embracing the angular designs seen in the later star forts. Nonetheless, it remained operational as an artillery fort {{for the rest of the}} century, with an initial garrison in 1540 of 24 men under the command of Chute, rising to 28 men and the captain after 1542. Although it had been fitted with gunloops for handguns from the very start, the castle initially relied heavily on archers for its own protection against attack from the land. It had stocks of 140 longbows and 560 <b>sheaves</b> of arrows in 1568, for example, probably for use by the local militia in the event of a war. Polearms were also stored there in considerable numbers, again probably for use by the militia.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} {{gates and}} wall separating the gardens {{from the park}} and farmland date from 1878 and are listed at grade II. The wrought-iron gates are by Cubitt & Co., and were exhibited at the Paris Exhibition of 1878. Two outer single gates and a double inner gate are supported by four sandstone piers. The outer pair of gate piers are capped by a bud-shaped device supported on scrolls; the inner pair are surmounted by a griffin and a lion, mirroring the statuary of the hall's terraces. The lower gate sections of lyre-like panels with leaf and spearhead motifs are topped with Jacobean-style arched panels. The ornate gate overthrows include shields and emblems capped with crowns, <b>sheaves</b> and sickles. The inner gates bear the inscription Quid retribuam domino ("What can I render to the Lord?"), while the outer gates bear the date. The wall, of brick with stone dressings, features arcading and has piers surmounted with ogee caps carved to match the tiles of the main hall tower. A further feature of the gardens to survive is a grade-II-listed sundial dating from the early 19th century, which stands {{to the rear of}} the house.|$|E

25|$|Direct and inverse {{images of}} <b>sheaves</b> Every {{continuous}} map f : X → Y between topological spaces induces a functor f ∗ from {{the category of}} <b>sheaves</b> (of sets, or abelian groups, or rings...) on X to the corresponding category of <b>sheaves</b> on Y, the direct image functor. It also induces a functor f −1 from the category of <b>sheaves</b> of abelian groups on Y to the category of <b>sheaves</b> of abelian groups on X, the inverse image functor. f −1 is left adjoint to f ∗.

50|$|The {{definition}} of a <b>sheaf</b> works on any site. So one can talk about a <b>sheaf</b> of sets on a site, a <b>sheaf</b> of abelian groups on a site, and so on. The {{definition of}} <b>sheaf</b> cohomology as a derived functor also works on a site. So one has <b>sheaf</b> cohomology groups Hj(X, E) for any object X of a site and any <b>sheaf</b> E of abelian groups. For the étale topology, this gives the notion of étale cohomology, {{which led to the}} proof of the Weil conjectures. Crystalline cohomology and many other cohomology theories in algebraic geometry are also defined as <b>sheaf</b> cohomology on an appropriate site.|$|R

25|$|There {{are also}} maps (or morphisms) from one sheaf to another; <b>sheaves</b> (of a {{specific}} type, such as <b>sheaves</b> of abelian groups) with their morphisms {{on a fixed}} topological space form a category. On the other hand, to each continuous map there is associated both a direct image functor, taking <b>sheaves</b> and their morphisms on the domain to <b>sheaves</b> and morphisms on the codomain, and an inverse image functor operating in the opposite direction. These functors, and certain variants of them, are essential parts of sheaf theory.|$|E

25|$|It is {{important}} to note that the distinction between the global and local versions is that the former relates maps between <b>sheaves,</b> whereas the latter relates (complexes of) <b>sheaves</b> directly and so can be evaluated locally.

25|$|In mathematics, a sheaf is a {{tool for}} {{systematically}} tracking locally defined data attached to the open sets of a topological space.
