40|$|Abstract. A {{method for}} {{evaluation}} of parasitic frequency modulation (wow) in archival audio is presented. The proposed approach utilizes <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>components</b> as their variations are highly correlated with the distortion variations. The <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>components</b> are extracted from audio signal by means of sinusoidal modeling procedures being often severely distorted and in case of wow also significantly modulated. The algorithm for <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>component</b> evaluation utilizes both magnitude and phase spectra information to enhance the tracking process. Additionally, a neural-network based prediction module is proposed to improve the tracking abilities in case of component discontinuities. Experiments concerning prediction of tonal component’s values are performed revealing that prediction can enhance sinusoidal modeling of wow distorted signals effectively. ...|$|R

These methods are {{an alternative to the}} discrete Fourier transform, providing high-resolution, smooth and easily interpretable spectral estimation over short signal frames. It is generally acknowledged that musical signals that exhibit both periodicity and variations can be modeled as <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>components</b> with various extents of modulation (generally characterized as band-limited frequency components), and remaining noise or wide-band frequency components that describe unvoiced and other noisy parts of the signal spectrum. Using single frame Fourier analysis makes is difficult to tell if spectral energy at a particular frequency is due to noise or <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>components.</b> Existing methods for such decomposition usually consider properties of Fourier phases, which are noisy. Our method decomposes a signal into sinusoidal, modulated <b>sinusoidal</b> and noise <b>components</b> based on a comparison between two spectral representations, namely autoregressive (AR) and minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR), both calculated from linear prediction coefficients (LPC) in a time varying manner. Using different optimal properties of each model, we develop estimators for frequencies and amplitudes (spectral envelope) of <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>components</b> (spectral lines) in noise and derive a “noisality” index that assigns different weights to contributions of <b>sinusoidal</b> and noise <b>components</b> at every frequency.

At the other extreme, if the sinusoidal frequency is low enough, the N-point finite signal sequence will be monotonic, and thus a root sequence for the median filter and all Hampel filters. For intermediate frequencies; however, <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>components</b> are neither implosion sequences nor roots, and as this example illustrates, the response of the Hampel filter to these components generally varies strongly with t.|$|R

This problem is a special case of the general problem of estimating the parameters of a real-valued homogeneous random field with mixed spectral distribution from a single observed realization of it. The large sample properties of the least squares (LS) estimator of {{the parameters of the}} <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>components</b> are derived, making no assumptions on the type of the probability distribution of the observed field. It is shown that if the disturbance field satisfies a combination of conditions comprised of a strong mixing condition and a condition on the order of its uniformly bounded moments, the normalized estimation error of the LS estimator is consistent asymptotically normal with zero mean and a normalized asymptotic covariance matrix for which a simple expression is derived. It is further shown that the LS estimator is asymptotically unbiased. The normalized asymptotic covariance matrix is block diagonal where each block corresponds to the parameters of a different <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>component.</b> Assuming further that the colored noise field is Gaussian, the LS estimator of the <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>components</b> is shown to be asymptotically efficient.

We propose a low cost real-time synthesizer design allowing processing of recorded and live sounds, synthesis of instruments and synthesis of speech and the singing voice. Introduction Many musical sound signals may be described as a combination of a pseudoperiodic waveform and of colored noise [1].

30|$|The {{resulting}} bitrate {{presented in}} Figures 6 and 7 strongly {{depends on the}} number of non-negligible <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>components</b> which increases according to the resulting SNR. According to Figures 6 and 7, informed analysis requires a lower bitrate than the ECUSQ method alone when the signal mixture is available. However, this benefit decreases when the target SNR is too high due to a large number of <b>sinusoidal</b> <b>components</b> which cannot be efficiently analyzed using the classic estimator. Moreover, as shown in Figure 6 for a realistic application on the entire mixture with a limited watermarking capacity, informed analysis offers a gain of more than 15 dB for the SNR. The practical results which use the maximal quality simultaneously for all source signals using entire watermark capacity are available online for listeninga.|$|R

The distensibility is chosen so that the natural bulge‐wave speed matches that of the water waves; a resonant interaction then occurs, and large bulge waves are generated, concentrating the wave energy. The best power take‐off (PTO) mechanism appears to be one distributed along the whole length of the tube, see [1] fig. 13. This paper analyses that option, considering in particular a non‐linear PTO in which air in chambers in the tube is pumped though one‐way valves between low and high pressure pneumatic accumulators.
