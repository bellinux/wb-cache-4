Various species of penguins and other flighted or flightless water birds such as auks, cormorants, guillemots, shearwaters, eider and <b>scoter</b> ducks and diving petrels are avid swimmers, {{and use their}} wings to propel through water.|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} a decline of surf <b>scoters,</b> white <b>scoters,</b> and black <b>scoters.</b> This {{decrease}} of <b>scoters</b> is the largest decrease in biomass of marine birds over the past 25 years in Puget Sound.|$|R
40|$|I {{measured}} foraging {{effort of}} surf <b>scoters</b> {{at the northern}} and southern peripheries of their winter distribution (Southeast Alaska and Baja California, Mexico, respectively), and compared those to foraging effort previously documented at the wintering range core (Strait of Georgia, British Columbia, Canada). I predicted that if foraging conditions influenced their winter distribution, foraging effort would be higher at the peripheries of the distribution and that <b>scoters,</b> which are typically diurnal foragers, might be forced to extend their foraging activities into nocturnal periods. Overall, <b>scoters</b> in Baja California foraged over twice as much as <b>scoters</b> in Alaska, with intermediate foraging effort at the range core. <b>Scoters</b> also foraged nocturnally in Baja California but not in Alaska or British Columbia. I conclude that foraging opportunity may limit winter distribution at the southern periphery, but other factors limit distribution at the northern periphery...|$|R
40|$|I {{examined}} diet, body condition, morphology, {{and physiology}} of white-winged <b>scoters</b> {{in relation to}} widely varying habitat conditions among wintering sites along the Pacific coast of British Columbia and northern Washington. White-winged <b>scoters</b> mainly consumed bivalves across all study sites, but showed flexibility to consume alternative prey in response to temporal changes in food resources. <b>Scoters</b> wintering at a highly exposed and unpredictable offshore site had higher lipid and body masses and different digestive morphology than birds at less exposed sites. Baseline corticosterone and plasma metabolites did not vary in response to differences in habitat conditions across sites. Collectively, {{these results suggest that}} wintering white-winged <b>scoters</b> achieve physiological homeostasis by varying diet, endogenous reserves, and gut morphology in response to differences in winter feeding sites...|$|R
25|$|These {{areas of}} water are {{inhabited}} by Eurasian beaver, which had disappeared {{some years ago}} due to intensive hunting, but which have now recovered their original population. Besides this, it is mostly a richness of birds that distinguishes the park's wetlands. It constitutes the southernmost extent in Sweden of the nesting area of many species, such as the greater scaup, the oldsquaw, the common <b>scoter,</b> and also a focus of important populations of red-necked phalarope, ruff, common greenshank and wood sandpiper. One also finds sometimes the Eurasian curlew, which is considered an endangered species.|$|E

6000|$|But I find in Buffon some {{interesting}} particulars not given in my text--namely, {{that the whole}} group differs from common chicks, {{not only in the}} lobed feet, but in these being set so far back, (becoming almost a fish's tail indeed, rather than a bird's legs,) that they are quite useless for walking, and could support the bird only on land if it stood upright: but that it [...] "dashes through the waves" [...] (i.e., the larger varieties through sea waves), and [...] "runs on the surface"? (i.e., the smaller varieties on pools,) with surprising rapidity; its motions are said to be never quicker and brisker than when under water. It pursues the fish to a very great depth, and is often caught in fishermen's nets. It dives deeper than the <b>scoter</b> duck, which is taken only on beds of shellfish left bare by the ebb-tide; while the Grebes are taken in the open sea, often at more than twenty feet depth.|$|E

40|$|SEVERAL YEARS AGO, Gwich’in {{hunters and}} eldersbegan {{to wonder why}} “black ducks ” (the local namefor white-winged <b>scoters</b> Melanitta fusca and surf <b>scoters</b> M. perspicallata) were less common {{than they had been}} previously. Wildlife {{biologists}} across North America have voiced similar concerns. Questions raised about the status of <b>scoters</b> provided a great opportunity for me to study these sea duck species as part of my Master’s research in Biology at the University of Saskatchewan. For instance, ecologists would like to understand why animal abundance varies in space and time and identify the mecha-nisms responsible for producing these patterns. Determin-ing habitat requirements of <b>scoters</b> and relating these patterns to variation in reproductive success can be an important step toward understanding the causes and con-sequences of animal distribution and population dynamics and developing conservation initiatives...|$|R

40|$|Waterfowl undergo {{simultaneous}} remigial moult, {{in which}} flight feathers are shed and then re-grown synchronously. Nutrient and energy demands and vulnerability to predation may be elevated during remigial moult, {{suggesting that this}} stage of the annual cycle could pose a constraint on population dynamics. I studied remigial moult in two sea ducks, Surf <b>Scoters</b> (Melanitta perspicillata) and White-winged <b>Scoters</b> (M. fusca), in southeast Alaska and the Salish Sea to evaluate evidence of temporal, energetic or nutritional constraints. <b>Scoters</b> exhibited a relatively long flightless period and high inter-individual variation in timing of moult, suggesting there were not strong temporal constraints during this phase of the annual cycle. Increasing body mass during the feather growth period indicated that <b>scoters</b> met costs of moult without relying on endogenous reserves and they did so at moderate levels of foraging effort, strong evidence of lack of energetic or nutritional constraints...|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of Surf <b>Scoters</b> (Melanitta perspicillata) was studied on staging {{grounds in}} spring of 2006 and compared to behaviour on moulting grounds later that summer. Moulting Surf <b>Scoters</b> have a distinct activity pattern {{in comparison to}} those on spring staging grounds. During moult, foraging occurs mainly {{in the morning and}} evening, whereas during the spring a similar proportion of birds foraged at all periods of the day. Birds having recently initiated moult foraged significantly less that on staging grounds. However, as moult progressed, this discrepancy disappeared. In addition, we tracked the movements of flightless Surf <b>Scoters</b> using satellite telemetry during the 2006 wing-moult period. Despite their reduced mobility, Surf <b>Scoters</b> are able to swim long distances while flightless. However, the majority of their activities are carried out within small core areas. This study also indicates that satellite telemetry can be used effectively to track the daily movements of wildlife...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2005 Breeding bird surveys {{indicate}} a long-term {{decline in the}} numbers of <b>scoters</b> (Melanitta sp.) in North America. My objectives were to estimate survival of nests, ducklings, and adult female White-winged <b>Scoters</b> (Melanitta fusca) breeding on the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska, 2002 - 2004, within their primary breeding range. I measured habitat variables at nest sites and random sites in the study area to characterize nest habitat selection, and investigated breeding incidence with a laboratory analysis of circulating concentrations of the plasma yolk precursors vitellogenin (VTG) and very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL). The low hen and nest survival rates I observed combined with the substantial proportion of non-breeders on the breeding ground (up to 28 %) may be responsible for the observed declines in abundance if annual survival rates are not high enough to maintain stable populations. <b>Scoters</b> avoided nesting in graminoid habitat, but nested in all other scrub or forested plant communities in proportion to their availability, selecting sites with more cover, higher variability of cover, and closer to edge and water than random sites. At the nest habitat scale, <b>scoters</b> are generalists, which may reduce the foraging efficiency of nest predators...|$|R
