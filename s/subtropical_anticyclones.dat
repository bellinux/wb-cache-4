40|$|In {{this study}} the {{relationship}} between the North American monsoon, the Californian sea surface temperature (SST) cold pool, the Rocky Mountains and the North Pacific <b>subtropical</b> <b>anticyclone</b> is investigated using the Hadley Centre's atmospheric climate model, HadAM 3. In 1996 Hoskins hypothesized that heating in the North American monsoon might be important for the maintenance of the summertime North Pacific <b>subtropical</b> <b>anticyclone,</b> since the monsoon heating may induce descent to the north-west of the monsoon in the descending eastern flank of the <b>subtropical</b> <b>anticyclone.</b> This descent is further enhanced by radiative cooling and is associated with equatorward surface winds parallel to the western coast of North America. These equatorward winds induce oceanic upwelling of cold water and contribute to the formation of the Californian SST cold pool, which may feed back on the anticyclone by further suppressing convection and inducing descent. More recently, Rodwell and Hoskins also investigated the global summer monsoon–subtropical anticyclone relationship. They examined the role that mountains play in impeding the progress of the low-level mid-latitude westerlies, either deflecting the westerlies northwards where they ascend along the sloping mid-latitude isentropes or deflecting them southwards forcing them to descend along the isentropes. In particular, the introduction of the Rockies into a primitive-equation model adiabatically induces descent in the eastern descending flank of the North Pacific <b>subtropical</b> <b>anticyclone.</b> These hypothesized mechanisms have been investigated using HadAM 3, focusing on the possible suppression of convection by the Californian SST cold pool, the response of the North Pacific <b>subtropical</b> <b>anticyclone</b> to the strength of the North American monsoon and the ‘blocking’ of the mid-latitude westerlies by the Rocky Mountains. The role of the Rockies is examined by integrating the model with modified orography for the Rocky Mountains. Changing the height of the Rockies alters the circulation in a way consistent with the mechanism outlined above. Higher Rocky mountains force the westerlies southwards, inducing descent in the eastern flank of the <b>subtropical</b> <b>anticyclone</b> as the air descends along the sloping isentropes. The relationship between the North American monsoon and the North Pacific <b>subtropical</b> <b>anticyclone</b> is investigated by suppressing the monsoon in HadAM 3. The suppression of the monsoon is accomplished by increasing the surface albedo over Mexico, which induces anomalous ascent on the eastward flank of the <b>subtropical</b> <b>anticyclone</b> and anomalous polewards surface winds along the western coast of the North American continent, also providing support for the above hypothesis. The removal of the Californian SST cold pool, however, has a statistically insignificant effect on the model, suggesting that in this model the feedback of the SST cold pool on the eastern flank of the anticyclone is weak. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{causes of}} the {{seasonal}} cycles of the <b>subtropical</b> <b>anticyclones,</b> and the associated zonal asymmetries of sea surface temperature (SST) across the subtropical oceans, are examined. In all basins the cool waters {{in the east and}} warm waters in the west are sustained by a mix of atmosphere and ocean processes. When the anticyclones are best developed, during local summer, subsidence and equatorward advection on the eastern flanks of the anticyclones cool SSTs, while poleward flow on the western flanks warms SSTs. During local winter the SST asymmetry across the subtropical North Atlantic and North Pacific is maintained by warm water advection in the western boundary currents that offsets the large extraction of heat by advection of cold, dry air of the continents and by transient eddies. In the Southern Hemisphere ocean processes are equally important in cooling the eastern oceans by upwelling and advection during local winter. Ocean dynamics are important in amplifying the SST asymmetry, as experiments with general circulation models show. This amplification has little impact on the seasonal cycle of the anticyclones in the Northern Hemisphere, strengthens the anticyclones in the Southern Hemisphere, and helps position the anticyclones over the eastern basins in both hemispheres. Experiments with an idealized model are used to suggest that the <b>subtropical</b> <b>anticyclones</b> arise fundamentally as a response to monsoonal heating over land but need further amplification to bring them up to observed strength.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an investigation on the variations of tropical and sub-tropical cyclone (TC) activity over the western North Pacific (WNP) associated with the variation of Tibetan Plateau heating force (HTP) during boreal summertime. The study is based on the activity of TC in summer time (June to August) during the period 1958 - 1997. The diabatic heating over the Tibetan Plateau is a significant diabatic heating area in mid-latitude of North Hemisphere in boreal summertime. There are recent indications that HTP forcing plays impotent role to the eastern Asia atmospheric circulation and the Asian summer monsoon. In this paper, it is investigated that the relationship between the HTP and East Asia circulation by using correlation and composition methods. It is found that the HTP is stronger than normal, which induced a Rossby Wavelike train in the region of the eastern coast of Asia to western Pacific Ocean.

40|$|The {{spectrum}} of meridional latent heat transport {{in the tropics}} and subtropics by disturbances to the zonal mean during all seasons is analyzed. The transport is divided into stationary and transient planetary- and subplanetary-scale eddy contributions. The stationary transport is largest in the subtropical lower troposphere and dominates the overall transport during summer. It is of planetary scale and the zonal scale of the transport corresponds {{to the number of}} <b>subtropical</b> <b>anticyclones.</b> The transient transport is large from the surface up to the midtroposphere and from the tropics to subpolar latitudes. It is dominated by the subplanetary-scale contribution during all seasons. Westward (eastward) - propagating waves dominate the transport in the tropics (subtropics and midlatitudes). The analysis reveals that, while the total eddy meridional latent heat transport is seamless from the deep tropics to the pole, it represents the sum of transport by distinct dynamical features. The role of the eddy meridional latent heat transport in the moist isentropic circulation is assessed using the statistical transformed Eulerian mean formulation, which converts the eddy transports into streamfunctions. The addition of the eddy latent heat streamfunction to the Eulerian mean plus eddy sensible heat streamfunction increases the mass transport by a factor of 2 – 3 in the subtropics and midlatitudes. The eddy transport is found to dominate the transport across the subtropical boundary. During Northern Hemisphere summer there is virtually no circulation in the absence of eddy latent heat transport.

40|$|The {{life cycle}} of the Southeast Asian–western North Pacific monsoon {{circulation}} is established by the northward migrations of the monsoon trough and the western Pacific <b>subtropical</b> <b>anticyclone,</b> and is reflected by the intraseasonal variations of mo nsoon westerlies and trad e easterlies {{in the form of}} an east–west seesaw oscillation. In this paper, an effort is made to disclose the influence of this monsoon circulation on tropical cyclone tracks during its different ph ases using composite charts of large-scale circulation for certain types of tracks. A majority of straight-moving (recurving) tropical cyclones appear during weak (strong) monsoon west- erlies and strong (weak) trade easterlies. The monsoon conditions associated with straight-moving tropical cyclones are linked to the intensified <b>subtropical</b> <b>anticyclone,</b> while that associated with recurving tropical cyclones is coupled with the deepened monsoon trough. The relationship between genesis locations and track characteristics is evolved from the intraseasonal variation of the monsoon circulation reflected by the east– west oscillation of monsoon westerlies and trade easterlies. Composite circulation differences between the flows associated with the two types of tropical cyclone tracks show a vertically uniform short wave train along the North Pacific rim, as portrayed by the Pacific–Japan oscillation. During the extreme phases of the monsoon life cycle, the anomalous circulation pattern east of Taiwan resembles this anomalous short wave train. A vorticity budget analysis of the strong monsoon condition reveals a vorticity tendency dipole with a positive zone to the north and a negative zone to the south of the deepened monsoon trough. This meridional juxtaposition of vorticity tendency propagates the monsoon trough northward. The interaction of a tropical cyclone with the monsoon trough intensifies the north–south juxtaposition of the vorticity tendency and deflects the tropical cyclone northward. In contrast, during weak monsoon conditions, the interaction be- tween a tropical cyclone and the subtropical high results in a northwestward motion steered by the intensified trade easterlies. The accurate prediction of the monsoon trough and the <b>subtropical</b> <b>anticyclone</b> variations coupled with the monsoon life cycle may help to improve the forecasting of tropical cyclone tracks...|$|R

The surface boundary conditions required to support the diagonally (northwest-southeast) oriented SPCZ are determined {{through a series of}} experiments with an atmospheric general circulation model. Continental configuration and orography do not have a significant influence on SPCZ orientation and strength. The key necessary boundary condition is the zonally asymmetric component of the sea surface temperature (SST) distribution. This leads to a strong <b>subtropical</b> <b>anticyclone</b> over the southeast Pacific that, on its western flank, transports warm moist air from the equator into the SPCZ region.

The climatological SPCZ is comprised of the superposition of these diagonal bands of convection. When the zonally asymmetric SST component is reduced or removed, the <b>subtropical</b> <b>anticyclone</b> and its associated moisture source is weakened.

The majority (65  %) of observations of oxidized mercury (Hg(II)) were below the instrument's detection limit (detection limit per flight: 58 – 228  pg m[superscript − 3]), consistent with model-calculated Hg(II) concentrations of 0 – 196  pg m[superscript − 3]. However, for observations above the detection limit we find that modeled Hg(II) concentrations are a factor of 3 too low (observations: 212 [*]±[*] 112  pg m[superscript − 3], model: 67 [*]±[*] 44  pg m[superscript − 3]). The highest Hg(II) concentrations, 300 – 680  pg m[superscript − 3], were observed in dry (RH [*]<[*]  35  %) and clean air masses during two flights over Texas at 5 – 7  km altitude and off the North Carolina coast at 1 – 3  km. The GEOS-Chem model, back trajectories and observed chemical tracers for these air masses indicate subsidence and transport from the upper and middle troposphere of the <b>subtropical</b> <b>anticyclones,</b> where fast oxidation of elemental mercury (Hg(0)) to Hg(II) and lack of Hg(II) removal lead to efficient accumulation of Hg(II). We hypothesize that the most likely explanation for the model bias is a systematic underestimate of the Hg(0) [*]+[*]Br reaction rate. We find that sensitivity simulations with tripled bromine radical concentrations or a faster oxidation rate constant for Hg(0) [*]+[*]Br, result in 1. 5 – 2 times higher modeled Hg(II) concentrations and improved agreement with the observations. The modeled tropospheric lifetime of Hg(0) against oxidation to Hg(II) decreases from 5  months in the base simulation to 2. 8 – 1. 2  months in our sensitivity simulations. In order to maintain the modeled global burden of THg, we need to increase the in-cloud reduction of Hg(II), thus leading to faster chemical cycling between Hg(0) and Hg(II).

Rapid changes towards more humid conditions in eastern South Africa as the Northern Hemisphere entered phases of extreme cooling were potentially driven by a combination of warming in the Agulhas Current and shifts of the <b>subtropical</b> <b>anticyclones.</b> These climate oscillations appear coherent with other Southern Hemisphere records but are anti-phased with respect to the East Asian Monsoon. Numerical modelling results reveal that higher precipitation in the KwaZulu-Natal province during precession maxima is driven by a combination of increased local evaporation and elevated moisture transport into eastern South Africa from the coast of Mozambique...|$|E
40|$|Meteorological {{highlights}} {{from the third}} NASA Global Tropospheric Experiment Chemical Instrumentation Test and Evaluation (GTE/CITE 3) are presented. During August and September 1989, research flights were conducted from Wallops Island, Virginia, and Natal, Brazil, and included airborne sampling of air masses over adjacent regions of the Atlantic Ocean. Isentropic backward trajectory calculations, wind vector/streamline fields, rawinsonde data, and GOES and METEOSAT satellite imagery are utilized to examine the meteorological conditions for each flight and to determine the transport paths of the sampled air masses. Some aspects of the chemical signatures of the sampled air are also discussed. During the series of flights based at Wallops Island, Virginia, the flow into the experiment area was governed primarily by {{the position of the}} North Atlantic <b>subtropical</b> <b>anticyclone.</b> The large-scale tropospheric circulation switched from primarily a marine flow during flights 1 - 4, to a predominantly offshore mid-latitude continental flow during flights 5 - 10. During these later flights, the regional influences of large eastern U. S. cities along with vertical mixing by typical summertime convective activity strongly influenced the chemical characteristics of the sampled air. During the series of flights based at Natal, Brazil, the dominant synoptic feature was the South Atlantic <b>subtropical</b> <b>anticyclone</b> which generally transported air across the tropical Atlantic toward eastern Brazil. Pronounced subsidence and a well-defined trade wind inversion often characterized the lower and middle troposphere over the Natal region. Some high-altitude recirculation of air from South America was observed, as was cross-equatorial transport which had come from northern Africa. Biomass burning plumes were observed on segments of all of the flights, the source region being the central and southern savannah regions of Africa...|$|R
50|$|Doñana Park has a mild, {{typically}} Mediterranean climate, {{characterized by}} dry summers and relatively wet winters resulting from {{variations in the}} polar front and the subtropical ridge of high pressure. The rainy seasons are intermediate, occurring in spring and in autumn; autumn especially can produce torrential rains caused by the accumulation {{during the summer of}} heat in nearby large bodies of water, and the arrival of polar air masses. In winter, however, thermal anticyclones may occur locally. Temperatures are mild throughout the year, with maximum temperatures varying about 17 °C from winter to summer. The most significant feature of the climate is the three to five months of dry weather in the summer, when it is dominated by the <b>subtropical</b> <b>anticyclone.</b>|$|R
40|$|THE {{meteorology}} in {{the marine}} area of the southeastern tropical Pacific (SEP) {{is dominated by the}} <b>subtropical</b> <b>anticyclone</b> which represents the descending branch of the Hadley-Walker circulation of the south Pacific, with which it interacts (Toniazzo 2010). VOCALS-REx, an intensive campaign of observations of cloud/aerosol properties and upper-ocean/lower atmosphere conditions, was conducted in October and November 2008 by a consortium of US, Chilean, Peruvian, and UK research institutions. It was mainly based in the north-Chilean city of Arica (18 S, 71 W). Measurements included radiosonde/dropsonde profiles, C- and W-band radar and lidar (up- and down-looking) reflectivities, extensive particle sampling for aerosol and cloud-droplet characterisation, ship CTDs, and floats. Particular focus was put on sampling the zonal strip along 20 S, where multi-annual dataset are available from two instrumented buoys deployed at 75 W an...|$|R
