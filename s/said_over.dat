25|$|From 8 to 12 August, {{as many as}} 10,000 {{residents}} fled to Yunnan {{province in}} neighbouring China, becoming refugees. The total number of refugees fleeing in the entire month may {{be as high as}} 30,000, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and later the Yunnan provincial government. Yunnan's police chief later reported that the number of refugees in Yunnan reached 37,000, including Burmese refugees as well as Kokang. Yunnan government officials stated they have established seven locations (particularly near the city of Nansan, where most of the refugees arrived) to house and treat the refugees; some locals, however, claimed that not all the refugees were being housed, or were being housed in unfinished buildings and tents. According to one refugee, about 13,000 of the refugees were housed in the tents, and 10,000–20,000 more stayed with friends or family in the area. By 31 August, some refugees (as many as 4,000, according to local officials, or 2,800 according to the junta government) had started returning to Kokang; by mid-September, Chinese officials <b>said</b> <b>over</b> 9,000 refugeees had returned and Myanmar officials <b>said</b> <b>over</b> 13,000; many refugees, however, were still afraid to go back.|$|E

Nancy Altman, who shared an office with Thomas at the Department of Education, testified that she heard {{virtually}} everything Thomas <b>said</b> <b>over</b> {{the course of}} two years, and never heard any sexist or offensive comment. Altman did not find it credible that Thomas could have engaged in the conduct alleged by Hill, without any of the dozens of women he worked with noticing it. Senator Alan K. Simpson questioned why Hill met, dined, and spoke by phone with Thomas on various occasions after they no longer worked together.|$|E
25|$|In 1957, Jacques Tits {{introduced}} {{the theory of}} buildings, which relate algebraic groups to abstract simplicial complexes. One of the assumptions is a non-triviality condition: If the building is an n-dimensional abstract simplicial complex, and if , then every k-simplex of the building must be contained {{in at least three}} n-simplices. This is analogous to the condition in classical projective geometry that a line must contain at least three points. However, there are degenerate geometries which satisfy all the conditions to be a projective geometry except that the lines admit only two points. The analogous objects in the theory of buildings are called apartments. Apartments play such a constituent role in the theory of buildings that Tits conjectured the existence of a theory of projective geometry in which the degenerate geometries would have equal standing with the classical ones. This geometry would take place, he <b>said,</b> <b>over</b> a field of characteristic one. Using this analogy it was possible to describe some of the elementary properties of F1, but {{it was not possible to}} construct it.|$|E

500|$|At 11:30am on 18October1968, {{the flat}} was raided by Sgt. Norman Pilcher, of Scotland Yard's Drugs Squad. In 1974, Lennon remembered that Ono {{answered}} {{the front door}} as a female voice had <b>said</b> (<b>over</b> the intercom), {{that there was a}} message from the Apple office. Ono opened the door and saw the female with five men, who were all dressed in plain-clothes. She panicked and closed the door, thinking they were Beatles' fans. Meanwhile, at the back window, another person was banging on the window and holding up a search warrant for Lennon to read. As Lennon was also panicking—not knowing at that point that they were all police officers—the raid consisted of seven police officers and two police dogs—he played for time and refused to open the window. Because of this, Pilcher later accused Lennon of obstruction of justice, which was a crime. Inside the flat, the police searched every room thoroughly, even though Lennon was supposed to accompany them whilst they did so, according to the law. Pilcher then summoned Lennon and pointed to a binocular case on a mantelpiece, asking him, [...] "Is this yours?" [...] Lennon replied in the affirmative, and was then shown 219grams of hashish, which was in the case.|$|E
500|$|In a joint {{statement}} released on July 15, 2015, the inspector general of the State Department and the inspector general {{of the intelligence community}} said that their review of the emails found information that was classified when sent, remained so {{at the time of their}} inspection and [...] "never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system." [...] They also stated unequivocally that this classified information should never have been stored outside of secure government computer systems. Clinton had <b>said</b> <b>over</b> a period of months that she kept no classified information on the private server that she set up in her house. Government policy, reiterated in the nondisclosure agreement signed by Clinton as part of gaining her security clearance, is that sensitive information can be considered as classified even if not marked as such. After allegations were raised that some of the emails in question fell into the so-called [...] "born classified" [...] category, an FBI probe was initiated regarding how classified information was handled on the Clinton server. The New York Times reported in February 2016 that nearly 2,100 emails stored on Clinton's server were retroactively marked classified by the State Department. Additionally, the intelligence community's inspector general wrote Congress to say that some of the emails [...] "contained classified State Department information when originated." [...] In May 2016, the inspector general of the State Department criticized her use of a private email server while secretary of state, stating that she had not requested permission for this and would not have received it if she had asked.|$|E

2500|$|By 2001, Sheets {{had been}} {{promoted}} to the Brewers' starting rotation. His first two starts resulted in losses, but he won his next four, while pitching to a 1.73 ERA.

2500|$|Opposition to Barberi {{was also}} present here where on his {{journeys}} to the Mass centre local youths would throw rocks at him, though two youths {{took to the}} decision to become Catholics when they were greatly edified to see Barberi kiss each rock that hit him {{and place it in}} his pocket. During many of these frequent attacks Barberi barely escaped death. Local Protestant ministers often held anti-Catholic lectures and sermons to ward the people away from Barberi and the Catholics. Wilson records how one of these ministers followed Barberi along a street shouting out various arguments against transubstantiation, Barberi was silent, but as the man was about to turn off, Barberi retorted: [...] "Jesus Christ <b>said</b> <b>over</b> the consecrated elements, [...] "This is my body" [...] you say [...] "No. It is not his body!"
