500|$|Taylor {{returned}} to baseball in 1995, {{and spent the}} season with the Rookie-level Gulf Coast Yankees. When he {{returned to}} the game, after surgery, he had lost 8mph off his fastball and was unable to throw a curveball for a strike. As a result, in his first season back, he had two wins, five losses, a 6.08 ERA, and 54 walks in 40 innings pitched. The Yankees planned to have Taylor spend the 1996 season with the Double-A Norwich Navigators, but he continued to struggle with his control in spring training, saying at one point, [...] "Sometimes I get the ball across the plate, <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> I've never held a ball in my life". He instead spent the year with the Single-A Greensboro Bats and walked 43 batters in 16.1 innings, going 05 with an 18.73 ERA in nine games; the Yankees removed him from their 40-man roster as a result.|$|E

50|$|I {{think the}} big {{challenge}} for Australian hip-hop is for it to expand on those 3000 people who will always buy the CD. The question people have to ask themselves is, who are the other 35 000 odd people who bought the Hilltop Hoods album? It’s such a small insular and at times disturbingly ignorant little slice of Australia that I think we’d just be banging our heads against the wall {{trying to get through}} to those 15-year-old kids. Yeah, I don’t know. There’s always that responsibility of just trying to keep it true, even though we don’t focus on that as much as a lot of acts do, I think it’s always in the back of everyone’s mind - probably whatever art form it is - that if they really love the art form that they’re attempting or drawing influences from then, you know, everyone is always really quite sensitive about other people’s perceptions in that culture or community. I think that’s the only responsibility, and obviously not to sell out is the other one. But that is pretty unlikely. And I’d say to hopefully bring more people in and that’ll change the culture of it, or it’ll make that more ignorant style of the culture a bit more isolated. I don’t know, to tell you the truth, <b>sometimes</b> <b>I</b> don’t <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> we’re part of the community that’s there at all. And neither are a lot of the artists we know, and even the artists that are respected in that community just throw their hands up and go ‘Look, I stopped trying to deal on that level with those fans a long time’.|$|R

2500|$|Although reviewers {{have read}} {{political}} intonations into the album's ostensible themes, deeming it “unashamedly prog in its ambition and dimensions”, Turner {{is reluctant to}} admit to such an agenda. [...] "I'd hesitate to call the record 'political' because Isis has never taken a public political stand on anything. At the same time, it's intended to draw a parallel between the system that Bentham created and what's {{going on in the}} world right now". Likewise, he notes that the album is “absolutely not about a political agenda. I always try to write about stuff that is specific to my life during the time I write an album. And I try to find things that I'm emotionally and intellectually attached to. We've never been a political band. But right now politics are such a great importance. You can travel everywhere and you simply cannot ignore them. And so this is one of the main things that have been occupying my mind during the creation of this record. So beyond these things just being interesting themselves they have a lot of relevance to what's {{going on in the world}} right now [...] I think these things are relevant to everybody's lives and specifically to me and this band and what we experienced through living in this country over the last couple of years. And also I think my lyrics are so abstract and fragmented <b>sometimes</b> that <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> those things are a better representation of what I'm writing about than printed lyrics might be.” Despite his denial that Panopticon is politically motivated, Turner does refer to the then-incumbent George W. Bush administration's tenure as a source of inspiration; about how Bentham's essay bore relevance to “hit home in terms of how [...] is treating its own citizens outside and within the country.” ...|$|R

The rabbit was a reference to Stephen King's , where King uses a rabbit in a cage with the number8 written on its back as an example for the connection between reader and writer. Emerson said that part of the appeal of the scene was that [...] "bunnies look so innocent, and the audience feels so tenderly about them you can feel nothing but beastly being mean to them". But Emerson added the rabbit in the scene had problems reacting to his attempts to scare him [...] "it was unfazed, it barely blinked".|$|R
