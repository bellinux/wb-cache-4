5|$|David's third book {{differed}} from its predecessors {{in that it}} drew little from anything she had already written. She spent many months in Italy researching it before starting work on the typescript. While she was away, the firm of her publisher, John Lehman, was closed down by its principal shareholder, and <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> under contract to the far less congenial company, Macdonald.|$|E
5|$|In November 2009 Manning {{wrote to}} a gender {{counselor}} in the United States, said she felt female, and discussed having surgery. The counselor told Steve Fishman of New York magazine in 2011 that it was clear Manning was in crisis, partly because of her gender concerns, but also because she was opposed {{to the kind of}} war in which <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> involved.|$|E
5|$|Born on 14 March 1822 in Naples, TeresaCristina {{became an}} orphan {{when her father}} died in 1830. Her mother {{is said to have}} {{neglected}} her after marrying a young officer in 1839. Historiography has long asserted that she was raised in lonely isolation, in an environment of religious superstition, intolerance and conservatism. It has also described Teresa Cristina as a soft and timid character, unlike her ruthless father or her impulsive mother. She has even been depicted as unassertive, and accustomed to be satisfied in whatever circumstances <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Another couple, Ellis and Renee, {{fear that}} {{they are at the}} {{beginning}} of the end of their relationship. Renee is thoughtful and honest, but recently <b>she's</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> feeling slightly isolated and bored with Ellis, who puts on a brash, macho front to disguise his insecurity.|$|R
50|$|Brooke Reynolds, FBI agent {{assigned}} to Faith. It was by chance {{she was not}} with Faith during the attempt made on the latter's life. From investigating the attempt which killed one FBI agent, to {{trying to track down}} Faith, <b>she</b> also <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> checking if the dead agent was an informant. However, <b>she</b> soon <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> suspected of being the informant herself.|$|R
60|$|The donkey {{was about}} to ask some further questions, when <b>she</b> {{suddenly}} <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> unable to speak: the time allowed them for conversation was over.|$|R
5|$|Knox began forcing Kelly to {{accompany}} him to ringside so he could {{keep an eye on}} her, making her his de facto valet. As a result, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> involved in the feud developing between Mike Knox and partner Test with Tommy Dreamer and his partner The Sandman, including being inadvertently hit with a cane by Sandman when Knox used her as a shield. She made her in-ring debut for the brand on the August 22, 2006 episode of ECW on Sci-Fi in a losing effort, as part of a six-person mixed tag team match which saw herself, Knox, and Test lose to Dreamer, Sandman and Torrie Wilson, in what was the last match of the feud.|$|E
5|$|On June 14, 1832, Cadron-Jetté's husband Jean-Marie died of cholera, one of {{many victims}} of that year's cholera epidemic, leaving Cadron-Jetté widowed. Cadron-Jetté responded to her husband's death by vowing to be in mourning, or wear black, for the {{remainder}} of her life. At that time, Cadron-Jetté's eldest two sons, Jean-Marie and Pierre (20 and 17 years old, respectively), were employed as shoemakers, and the eldest daughter, Rose (19) was engaged (and was married in July 1833), while Cadron-Jetté's other four surviving children still required Cadron-Jetté's care, as did Cadron-Jetté's elderly mother. It was not until 1838, following the death of Cadron-Jetté's mother and the maturity or death of her remaining children, that <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> with time free to devote to charitable activities.|$|E
5|$|Weston {{moved from}} Capitol to Columbia Records and, in 1950, Stafford {{followed}} suit. Content and very comfortable working with him, Stafford {{had had a}} clause inserted in her contract with Capitol stating that if Weston left that label, she would automatically be released from her obligations to them. When that happened, Capitol wanted Stafford to record eight more songs before December 15, 1950, and <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> in the unusual situation of simultaneously working for two competing record companies, an instance that was very rare in an industry where musicians were seen as assets. In 1954, Stafford became the second artist after Bing Crosby to sell 25 million records for Columbia. She was presented with a diamond-studded disc to mark the occasion.|$|E
50|$|Not surprising, <b>she</b> soon <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> {{as one of}} {{the five}} handpicked by the late SS Nadkarni, who was then IDBI chairman, to set up NSE from scratch.|$|R
60|$|She stopped, {{through the}} {{difficulty}} <b>she</b> <b>found</b> in expressing <b>herself.</b>|$|R

5|$|After the Japanese {{occupied}} Indonesia in 1942, Santoso {{left her}} work as a teacher and found employment as legal assistant to Soepomo, who later became the country's first minister of justice. In 1945, with the Japanese preparing to withdraw from the Indies and the proclamation of independence looming, Santoso {{became a member of the}} Committee for Preparatory Work for Indonesian Independence. On 12 March 1946, Santoso became the first ever female cabinet member when she was selected as services minister in the Second Sjahrir Cabinet. Working quickly and efficiently, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> organising the return of internees from Japanese-run camps. She was kept on through the Third Sjahrir Cabinet, but when it dissolved on 26 June 1947, Santoso refused another term as social minister. She instead chose to work as head of prime minister Amir Sjarifuddin's secretariat. She kept this position into the First Hatta Cabinet. During Operation Kraai, a Dutch-led offensive on the city of Yogyakarta on 19 December 1948, her husband was killed outside Maguwo.|$|E
25|$|On 11 May 1808 Bacchante {{captured}} Griffon off Cape Antonio. Bacchante pursued Griffon {{for almost}} seven hours, and fought {{her for a}} half an hour. Griffon only struck when <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> crowded some 100 metres from the breakers with Bacchante only some 200 meters from her. Griffon was still under Gautier's command. In the engagement Griffon had five men wounded, while Bacchante suffered no casualties.|$|E
25|$|The Timekeeper and its {{original}} European counterpart Le Visionarium {{marked the first}} time that the Circle-Vision film process was used to deliver a narrative story line. This required a concept to explain the unusual visual characteristics of the Theater, hence the character Nine-Eye. Nine-Eye was sent through Time by The Timekeeper, so that she could send back the surrounding images as she recorded them in whichever era <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> in.|$|E
60|$|Victoria {{had begun}} to realize that, in the few minutes which had elapsed since <b>she</b> had <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> on the roadside, gazing up into young Tom's eyes, she had somehow become quite {{intimate}} with him.|$|R
5000|$|<b>She</b> also <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> being stalked by Horace Wylie, [...] "a Washington {{lawyer with}} a wife and three children", who [...] "was 17 years older than Elinor. He stalked her for years, {{appearing}} wherever she was." ...|$|R
3000|$|As {{time had}} gone on, however, she said <b>she</b> had <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> feeling {{increasingly}} depleted, rather than supported and nourished. “By year four and five, you are like, ‘Now I am really fed up by this’.” [...]...|$|R
25|$|After {{nearly a}} decade of labor in this field, she {{returned}} East, and, through the winter of 1876-7, was, with her husband, {{in charge of a}} ladies' school in Yonkers, New York, but in the following autumn, removed with her husband to Buffalo. A few years later, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> in her old home in Cleveland, her husband having received a call to the charge of the normal school in that city.|$|E
25|$|Beginning with My Name Is Barbra, {{her early}} albums were often medley-filled keepsakes of her {{television}} specials. Starting in 1969, she began attempting more contemporary material, {{but like many}} talented singers of the day, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> out of her element with rock. Her vocal talents prevailed, and she gained newfound success with the pop and ballad-oriented Richard Perry-produced album Stoney End in 1971. The title track, written by Laura Nyro, was a major hit for Streisand.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{predominantly}} male {{environment in which}} <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself,</b> she never renounced her femininity, and would carry on dyeing her hair blonde, sending her friend Inna Pasportnikova {{to the hospital to}} fetch hydrogen peroxide for her. She would fashion scarves from parachute material, dyeing the small pieces in different colours and stitching them together and would not hide her love of flowers, which she picked at every available occasion, favouring red roses. She would make bouquets and keep them in the cockpit, which were promptly discarded by the male pilots who shared her aircraft.|$|E
50|$|In 1975, Dia and the {{surviving}} {{members of her}} family, were forced to flee the advancing communist movement, Pathet Lao in their takeover of her home country of Laos. <b>She</b> soon <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> a refugee in Thailand.|$|R
50|$|<b>She</b> {{eventually}} <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> serving {{prison time}} for her pursuit of an organized crime cartel based in New Orleans called the LOA and killing its leadership, using Squad operatives Ravan, Poison Ivy and Deadshot in the process.|$|R
5000|$|Brown ran for reelection, {{even though}} <b>she</b> now <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> in a {{district}} that was over 62 percent new to her. [...] In the August 30, 2016 Democratic primary, Brown was defeated by former state senator Al Lawson.|$|R
25|$|Anthony {{embarked}} on her career of social reform with energy and determination. Schooling herself in reform issues, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> {{drawn to the}} more radical ideas of people like William Lloyd Garrison, George Thompson and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Soon she was wearing the controversial Bloomer dress, consisting of pantaloons worn under a knee-length dress. Although it was more sensible than the traditional heavy dresses that dragged the ground, she reluctantly quit wearing it after a year because it gave her opponents the opportunity to focus on her apparel rather than her ideas.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} event, partnering Jelena Janković, she notched up her second career WTA doubles title, almost exactly six years {{from her first}} at Tashkent. An early {{retirement}} against Alona Bondarenko {{in the first round}} of the Ondina Open at 's-Hertogenbosch the following week curtailed her final competitive preparations for her debut appearance at Wimbledon. But with an entry ranking of 30th, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> seeded 27th after some withdrawals, and thus achieved another first for her country in becoming the first Chinese woman ever to be seeded for entry into a Grand Slam tournament.|$|E
25|$|On 11 May 1808 Bacchante {{captured}} the French navy brig Griffon off Cape Antonio. Bacchante pursued Griffon for almost seven hours, and fought {{her for a}} half an hour, Griffon only struck when <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> crowded some 100 metres from the breakers with Bacchante only some 200 meters from her. Griffon was armed with fourteen 24-pounder carronades and two 6-pounder guns, and had a crew of 105 men {{under the command of}} lieutenant de vaisseau Jacques Gautier. In the engagement Griffon had five men wounded, while Bacchante had suffered no casualties.|$|E

50|$|A guest {{appearance}} on The Podge and Rodge Show prompted producers to offer Morahan {{the role of}} host. In 2009, she hosted the show alongside cult favourites Podge and Rodge. But <b>she</b> soon <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> exposed and vulnerable at RTÉ.|$|R
50|$|Kyouyaku Yume is a blue-haired {{girl with}} no {{recollection}} of her identity and past. With a vaguely written clue and a turquoise pebble which <b>she</b> <b>found</b> on <b>herself</b> when <b>she</b> awoke, she goes on a journey of self-discovery.|$|R
25|$|Teresa {{entered a}} Carmelite Monastery of the Incarnation in Ávila, Spain, on 2 November 1535. <b>She</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> {{increasingly}} in disharmony with the spiritual malaise prevailing at the monastery. Among the 150 nuns living there, the observance of cloister — {{designed to protect}} and strengthen the spirit and practice of prayer — became so lax that it actually lost its very purpose. The daily invasion of visitors, many of high social and political rank, spoiled the atmosphere with frivolous concerns and vain conversations. These violations of the solitude absolutely essential to progress in genuine contemplative prayer grieved Teresa {{to the extent that}} she longed to do something.|$|E
25|$|In Moscow, Peggy did {{secretarial}} {{work for her}} father and became friends with {{the daughters of the}} Yugoslav and Chinese ambassadors, and the daughter of an Iranian diplomat, who was to remain a lifelong friend. In 1941, at the age of 20, with her parents in London, and her sister in Iran, she was left in charge of the evacuation of the British Embassy, with the German invasion of Russia looming. Since she was officially a secretary in the Foreign Service, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> working for a Mr. Cook in the consular department in Teheran. Later on, when the British Army took over the Iranian railway system, she worked as a secretary for the Brigadier who was in charge.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} infamous crimes in the city took place in March 1953, when elderly widow Mabel Monahan was killed in her Burbank home. When Monahan, 64, {{opened the door to}} her house on West Parkside Avenue, <b>she</b> <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> confronted by a stranger, Barbara Graham (also {{sometimes}} referred to as Barbara Wood). Graham, along with some other accomplices, had heard rumors of a Las Vegas gambling fortune hidden in Monahan's house. The crime scene was discovered by a gardener, who went to Monahan's front door and looked in to find a ransacked home and a grisly trail of blood. The gardener immediately called the Burbank Police, who discovered Monahan's badly beaten body, half in and half out of a closet.|$|E
5000|$|The series {{attempted}} controversy, but {{an episode}} on cultural mediocrity drew criticism {{from one of}} its interview subjects, Gladys Taylor, who assumed the discussion was about the arts. Instead, when the programme aired, <b>she</b> unexpectedly <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> ridiculed as a [...] "mediocrat".|$|R
60|$|Turning to {{the right}} on Burton Street, <b>she</b> soon <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> walking rapidly westward through deserted streets lined by {{factories}} and warehouses, and silent in the Sabbath calm.... She thought of Hodder, {{she would have liked}} to go to him in that hour....|$|R
50|$|Stefani {{entered the}} league in 1943 with the South Bend Blue Sox, playing for them five years before joining the Rockford Peaches (1948). <b>She</b> then <b>found</b> <b>herself</b> on the move again, this time as a {{chaperone}} with South Bend for two more years (1949-1950).|$|R
