40|$|Lecturepg. 69 The {{technique}} of measuring steady loads on centrifugal pump impellers via magnetic bearings is demonstrated and {{shown to be}} reliable way of clarifying loads, which have been traditionally difficult to determine both analytically and experimentally. Among the most challenging geometries in this respect is the semiopen impeller in an end-suction single volute pump. Because of the uneven distribution of {{the pressure on the}} shroud of a semiopen impeller, axial and radial loads are created. In addition to the classical axial and radial loads, it is recognized that a hydraulic couple is also generated with semiopen impellers. The hydraulic couple is not discussed. In the past, experimental evaluation of the hydraulic forces and moments on impellers has been accomplished through techniques such as strain measurements and static pressures at taps in the walls adjacent to the impeller. The present experimental results are obtained using the magnetic bearing test rig that was designed to measure the forces and moments that result from the hydrodynamic interactions in a centrifugal pump under various operating conditions. The comparison is presented between the results for the <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> <b>pump</b> obtained by the traditional methods and those derived from magnetic bearing reactions.

5000|$|An {{inherent}} suction {{limitation of}} all suction pumps {{is that they}} can only lift a liquid through utilizing atmospheric pressure. For pure water the theoretical maximum lift is approximately 10.3 m (33.9 feet)).

Through this the overall density of the sludge/air mixture can be reduced below that of pure water and thus a higher lift (10-15 m) can be reached under optimal conditions. Other factors affecting the possible lift and total length of the suction hose are that <b>single</b> <b>stage</b> vacuum <b>pumps</b> only reach a 85-90% partial vacuum, and that small air leakages, pipe friction losses and the viscosity of the liquid further reduce the possible lift.|$|R

Moreover, retrofitted buildings allow the application of low temperature heat emission systems combined with heat pumps. In this context, the potential of air-water heat pumps is assessed from an energetic and economic point of view, by considering multiple combinations of building retrofit options, heating system components and energy prices, resulting in different scenarios. Each scenario leads to a different space heating demand while domestic hot water demand is equal in all cases.

40|$|Thermal transpiration-driven Knudsen pumps {{have the}} ability to pump gas {{molecules}} without the use of any moving parts. This promises high structural reliability and low frictional losses. However, the dearth of suitable transpiration materials with appropriate properties has limited their performance, especially for atmospheric pressure operation. This thesis describes the use of bulk nanoporous materials for thermal transpiration-driven gas pumping at atmospheric pressure. A naturally-occurring zeolite, clinoptilolite, is used to demonstrate the feasibility of thermal transpiration-driven Knudsen pumps using bulk nanoporous ceramics. For an input power of 5. 35 W, the initial prototype has a temperature bias of 38 K across the thickness of the zeolite disc. This results in a gas flow of ≈ 0. 12 sccm with a nominal pressure load of ≈ 50 Pa at the output, or a maximum pressure head of ≈ 1 kPa. Transient pressure response at the sealed outlet of a Knudsen pump is analyzed using a fitted model, which allows us to quantify various non-idealities. Several other synthetic nanoporous ceramics are also evaluated for their thermal transpiration-driven gas flow characteristics. A clay-based ceramic 15 PC is identified as suitable for multistage Knudsen pumps that may accommodate higher pressure heads. While operating at 55 K above room temperature, a 9 -stage Knudsen pump is demonstrated to generate a maximum pressure head ≈ 12 kPa, or a gas flow of ≈ 3. 8 µL/min. against a pressure head of 160 Pa. The pump has a footprint of ≈ 8 x 8 mm 2 /stage. To date, a multistage Knudsen pump has operated continuously for more than 7000 hours without any deterioration in its performance.
