5000|$|A {{variation}} on the 'open baffle' approach is to mount the loudspeaker driver in a very large <b>sealed</b> <b>enclosure,</b> providing minimal 'air spring' restoring force to the cone. This minimizes {{the change in the}} driver's resonant frequency caused by the enclosure. Some infinite baffle 'enclosures' have used an adjoining room, basement, or a closet or attic. This is often the case with exotic rotary woofer installations, as they are intended to go to frequencies lower than 20 Hertz and displace large volumes of air. [...] "Infinite baffle" [...] or simply [...] "IB" [...] is also used as a generic term for sealed enclosures of any size, the name being used because of the ability of a <b>sealed</b> <b>enclosure</b> to prevent any interaction between the forward and rear radiation of a driver at low frequencies.|$|E
50|$|The acoustic-suspension woofer {{uses the}} elastic cushion of air within a <b>sealed</b> <b>enclosure</b> {{to provide the}} {{restoring}} force for the woofer diaphragm.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{installing}} fragile, light weight, high temperature fiber insulation, particularly where the insulation {{is to be}} used as a seal strip providing a high order of thermal barrier insulation is discussed. The process is based on provision of a strip of the mineral batting cut oversize by a predetermined amount, saturated in a fugitive polymer solution, compressed in a mold, dried and cured to form a rigidized batting material which is machined to required shape. The machine dimensions would normally be at least nominally less than the dimensions of the cavity to be sealed. After insertion in the cavity, which may be a wire-mesh <b>seal</b> <b>enclosure,</b> the apparatus is subjected to baking at a temperature sufficiently high to cause the resin to burn off cleanly, leaving the batting substantially in its original condition and expanded into the cavity or <b>seal</b> <b>enclosure...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Though helpful with {{improving}} efficiency, {{bass reflex}} cabinets can have poor transient response compared to <b>sealed</b> <b>enclosures</b> at frequencies near the lower limit of performance, causing [...] "smearing" [...] or a longer resonance of the bass notes.

50|$|Essentially, {{the goal}} of the {{transmission}} line is to minimize acoustical or mechanical impedance at frequencies corresponding to the driver's fundamental free air resonance. This simultaneously reduces stored energy in the driver's motion, reduces distortion, and critically damps the driver by maximizing acoustic output (maximal acoustical loading or coupling) at the terminus. This also minimizes the negative effects of acoustic energy that would otherwise (as with a <b>sealed</b> <b>enclosure)</b> be reflected back to the driver in a sealed cavity.|$|E
5000|$|Also {{known as}} vented (or ported) systems, these {{enclosures}} have a vent or hole {{cut into the}} cabinet and a port tube affixed to the hold, to improve low-frequency output, increase efficiency, or {{reduce the size of}} an enclosure. Bass reflex designs are used in home stereo speakers (including both low- to mid-priced speaker cabinets and expensive hi-fi cabinets), bass amplifier speaker cabinets, keyboard amplifier cabinets, subwoofer cabinets and PA system speaker cabinets. Vented or ported cabinets use cabinet openings or transform and transmit low-frequency energy {{from the rear of the}} speaker to the listener. They deliberately and successfully exploit the principles of the Helmholtz resonator. As with sealed enclosures, they may be empty, lined, filled or (rarely) stuffed with damping materials. Port tuning frequency is a function of cross-section and length. This enclosure type is very common, and provides more sound pressure level near the tuning frequency than a <b>sealed</b> <b>enclosure</b> of the same volume, though it actually has less low frequency extension since the [...] "rolloff" [...] is steeper (24db/oct vs. 12db/oct for a <b>sealed</b> <b>enclosure).</b> Malcolm Hill pioneered the use of these designs in a live event context in the early 1970s.|$|E
