40|$|Background: Repeated {{failure of}} in vitro {{fertilization}} treatment is frustrating to the patients and their clinicians. Various treatment plans and a change of protocol have been suggested for “low responders”; however, patients who fail treatment repeatedly inspite of good quality embryos pose a special therapeutic challenge. Additional challenge would be imposed on that particular group when the local IVF regulating low does not permit <b>surplus</b> <b>embryo</b> freezing. Objective: To examine whether sequential transfer of embryos on day 3 and on day 5 after ovum pick-up improves IVF/ET success rates in patients with repeated consecutive IVF failures (⩾ 3 trials) compared to day 3 alone, with the background that local regulation prohibits embryo freezing. Study design: Randomized controlled study. Women scheduled for IVF/ET with repeated consecutive IVF failures (⩾ 3 trials) were randomized to either sequential transfer of embryos on day 3 and on day 5 after ovum pick-up (Group I =  74) or conventional day 3 transfer (Group II =  73) as a control. The primary outcome measures were clinical pregnancy rate and implantation rate. The secondary outcome measures were ongoing pregnancy rate and early pregnancy loss. Results: Baseline and cycle characteristics were comparable in both groups. Clinical pregnancy rate (per embryo transfer) was significantly higher in sequential ET group (37. 8 %) compared to that in day 3 group (21. 9 %) (P value < 0. 05). Also, implantation rate (per embryos transferred) was significantly higher in sequential ET group (17. 1 %) compared to that in control group (10. 5 %) (P value < 0. 01). Similarly, ongoing pregnancy (per embryo transfer) was significantly higher in sequential ET group (33. 8 %) compared to that in day 3 group (19. 2 %) (P value < 0. 05). Conclusions: Patients with repeated implantation failures, treatment with the sequential embryo transfer approach had significantly improved pregnancy outcomes compared to regular day 3 transfers. This approach would be particularly useful when neither oocyte freezing is a clinical option due to insufficient number of collected oocytes nor <b>surplus</b> <b>embryo</b> freezing is an option as the current local regulatory law prohibits it...|$|E

40|$|International audienceStudy question: In {{couples who}} have chosen and {{confirmed}} the fate of surplus frozenembryos, which factors influence their decision, with a special emphasis on their symbolic representation of the embryo(s) ? summary answer: Embryo representation and gamete donation use significantly influence the fate of surplus cryopreserved embryos. what is known already: Previous studies report difficulties for couples {{to decide whether or}} not to continue storing their frozen embryo(s) and different factors have been already highlighted which influence their decision, including embryo conceptualization, information and support provided by the medical institution, quality of embryo(s) and life events. Little is known, however, about couples who definitely decided to stop their parental project and finalized the process of decision-making about the fate of their cryopreserved embryo(s). study design, size, duration: This prospective study was conducted over a period of 3 years (2007 - 2010) and included IVF/ICSI patients with surplus frozen embryos, who made a final embryo disposition decision. Among the 280 eligible IVF/ICSI patients, 247 agreed to participate in the study. According to the available options, 91 persons chose to 'stop cryopreservation', 77 chose donation to 'research' and 48 'embryo donation' to infertile couples. Furthermore, 31 participants who chose embryo donation for a parental project were refused by the center as not compatible with their mandatory medical conditions. Among them, 27 participants then selected donation to research as a new option and were included in a fourth group: 'donation to research after Refusal of Embryo Donation for parental project' or 'research- RED' (n = 27). Four participants chose 'stop cryopreservation', however, given the small number of subjects this latter group was not included in the analysis. In all, 243 participants who made a final choice concerning the fate of their cryopreserved embryos were included in this study. participants/materials, setting, methods: Participants were sent a letter of invitation to a semi-structured interview of 30 min with a psychologist. Interviews were conducted separately for each partner, including a questionnaire with a common part and a specific part, according to the chosen option, and allowing a quantitative evaluation. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to assess the link between their embryo representation and their decision about their embryos' fate. main results and the role of chance: After adjustment for age, gender, gamete donation, number of children and the different embryo representations, a choice to 'stop cryopreservation' is more frequent if the embryo is represented as a child [odds ratio (OR) adjusted = 3. 29, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 62 ' 6. 66], P = 0. 0009. Representing the embryo as a project prompts patients to choose 'donation to research' [OR adjusted = 3. 76, 95 % CI = 1. 56 ' 9. 06], P = 0. 0032. Respondents are more likely to choose 'embryo donation' if they represent the embryo as a potential person [OR adjusted = 3. 77, 95 % CI = 1. 45 ' 9. 80], P = 0. 0064. Furthermore, patients who benefited from gamete donation are 10 times more likely to donate their embryos to another couple [OR adjusted = 10. 62, 95 % CI = 3. 99 ' 28. 30], P, 0. 0001. For more than half the participants (57 %) the decision-making was easy, however, deciding to stop cryopreservation was significantly more difficult than choosing research or embryo donation (P, 0. 0001). limitations, reasons for caution: Socio-economic status, moral and religious affiliations are known to influence the choice of couples but analyzing these factors was not an aim of the present study. wider implications of the findings: When couples definitely decide to stop their parental project, the embryo symbolic representation remains the main factor that influences the fate of their frozen embryo(s). Moreover, this representation can evolvewhen influenced by external events and information provided. In order to support patients who are making this difficult decision, it could be helpful to explore this symbolic representation early in the IVF/ICSI procedure, before <b>surplus</b> <b>embryo</b> freezing, as a new tool enhancing the accuracy of counseling. study funding/competing interest(s) : this study was supported by a grant from the 'Agence de la biomedicine (ABM) ', the national regulatory ART agency, under the authority of the French Ministry of Health.

Strategies for handling ambivalence during attitude formation were identified: the six strategies comprise cognitive and communicative strategies, and were integrated into a model of attitude formation under ambivalence. As ambivalence is a relevant phenomenon in attitude formation within IVF treatment, assessment of ambivalence is strongly recommended in social science studies investigating ethical problems in patient care.

40|$|When {{patients}} undergo fertility treatment, it {{is likely}} that a <b>surplus</b> of <b>embryos</b> will be created. The existence of these <b>surplus</b> <b>embryos</b> creates responsibilities for the clinics where they are stored and for the people who own them. Since 2001, the owners of the <b>surplus</b> <b>embryos</b> in the UK have the option to donate them to be used in stem cell research (SCR). This development has generated a new population - potential embryo donors to SCR – who have unique support needs as they are neither fertility patients nor donors. However, little is known how lay and professional stakeholders associated with fertility treatment and SCR have conceptualised the support needs of potential embryo donors to SCR or have responded to the additional task once the option became available. In this paper, we draw on Gieryn’s concept of boundary-work to explore how the emergence of donating embryos to SCR has provided opportunities for embryologists, counsellors and scientists to shift, adapt or confirm their roles, knowledge base and areas of expertise. We present a thematic analysis of 21 in-depth, semi-structured interviews conducted between September 2006 and January 2007 with UK lay and professional stakeholders associated with fertility treatment, and SCR.

This investigation evaluated an application for array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) in assessment of <b>surplus</b> <b>embryos</b> prior to cryopreservation. METHODS: First-time IVF patients undergoing elective single embryo transfer and having at least one extra non-transferred embryo suitable for cryopreservation were offered enrollment in the study. Patients were randomized into two groups: Patients in group A (n= 55) had embryos assessed first by morphology and then by aCGH, performed on cells obtained from trophectoderm biopsy on post-fertilization day 5. Only euploid embryos were designated for cryopreservation. Patients in group B (n= 48) had embryos assessed by morphology alone, with only good morphology embryos considered suitable for cryopreservation. RESULTS: Among biopsied embryos in group A (n= 425), euploidy was confirmed in 226 (53. 1 %). After fresh single embryo transfer, 64 (28. 3 %) <b>surplus</b> euploid <b>embryos</b> were cryopreserved for 51 patients (92. 7 %). In group B, 389 good morphology blastocysts were identified and a single top quality blastocyst was selected for fresh transfer. All group B patients (48 / 48) had at least one blastocyst remaining for cryopreservation. A total of 157 (40. 4 %) blastocysts were frozen in this group, a significantly larger proportion than was cryopreserved in group A (p= 0. 017, by chi-squared analysis). CONCLUSION: While aCGH and subsequent frozen embryo transfer are currently used to screen embryos, this is the first investigation to quantify the impact of aCGH specifically on embryo cryopreservation. Incorporation of aCGH screening significantly reduced the total number of cryopreserved blastocysts compared to when suitability for freezing was determined by morphology only. IVF patients should be counseled that the benefits of aCGH screening will likely come at the cost of sharply limiting the number of <b>surplus</b> <b>embryos</b> available for cryopreservation...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The recent {{derivation}} {{of embryonic}} stem cell lines from human blastocysts and related implica-tions for regenerative medicine has intensi®ed a longstanding debate {{about the use of}} human embryos for research purposes. However, studies have shown that few couples with stored embryos opt to donate them for research. Herein, the attitudes and concerns of potential embryo donors to donation of <b>surplus</b> <b>embryos</b> for medical research were examined. METHODS: From a total of 509 couples who had stored frozen embryos and who had received a questionnaire about embryo donations for medical research, 152 women (30 %) and 123 male partners (24 %) responded. Embryos had been stored for a mean of 2. 25 years (range 3 months to 12 years). RESULTS: Some 10 % of respondents indicated it probable, and 34 % possible, that they would donate their <b>surplus</b> <b>embryos</b> for research in the future. Women respondents whose embryos had been stored longer, and those committed to the practice of a religion, were more worried about their embryos. Respondents positively disposed to donation commented on their desire not to waste embryos, a desire to help infertile couples, and/or to advance scienti®c knowledge. Those with negative views commented on the embryo as a potential child and expressed concerns about a perceived lack of con-trol over the type of research to be carried out.

40|$|Human {{embryonic}} stem cell research (ESCR) raises ethical issues. Among the sources of {{embryonic stem}} cells are (i) embryos left from in vitro fertilisation (IVF) trials which are no longer needed for reproduction denoted as ‘surplus embryos’, and (ii) embryos intentionally created solely for research purposes from donated gametes via IVF, denoted as ‘research embryos’. The process of extracting stem cells from these 4 – 5 day old embryos which are subsequently destroyed in the research raises ethical controversies. Past studies on the ethics of ESCR largely revolve around the moral status of embryo, which is secular in nature. However, in a multi-religious and multi-cultural country like Malaysia, the ethical discussions pertaining to ESCR have taken a different outlook given the diverse views within and among the various faiths. The Malaysian Guidelines on Stem Cell Research and Therapy (2009) is based on the Islamic ruling (fatwa). Accordingly, <b>surplus</b> <b>embryos</b> are allowed to be used in research, but the creation of embryos solely for research purposes is prohibited. This study acknowledges the absence of documented views from other main religions like Buddhism, Hinduism and Catholicism pertaining to ESCR in Malaysia. In addition, no previous study has collected multiple religious viewpoints on the use of <b>surplus</b> and research <b>embryos</b> in ESCR. Hence, this study explores the ethical considerations of the religious leaders from the Buddhist, Hindu and Catholic traditions pertaining to ESCR in Malaysia, and their viewpoints on the use of <b>surplus</b> and research <b>embryos.</b> In this regard, the ethical standpoints of 11 religious leaders, comprising four Buddhist monks and leaders, four Hindu leaders and three Catholic priests were obtained via semi-structured, face-to-face iv interviews. The ethical responses of these participants are presented in reflection of various sacred texts. The main findings of this study is the emergence of three ethical concerns, denoted as themes, namely (i) sanctity of life, (ii) ‘do no harm’ and (ii) ‘intention’ of the research. Concerns on sanctity of life are directed at the religious notion of ensoulment and early consciousness, deliberating as to whether there is a sign of life in a 5 -day old embryo. The precept ‘do no harm’ is closely related to the religious principle of ahimsa which prohibits hurting living entities. Finally, ‘intention’ of the research is viewed as a strong point among Buddhist and Hindu respondents to encourage ESCR. The findings indicate that generally, all Buddhist leaders approve the use of <b>surplus</b> and research <b>embryos</b> in ESCR except for one leader who disapproved the use of research embryos. The Hindu leaders cautiously support ESCR but it is limited to the use of <b>surplus</b> <b>embryos.</b> The Catholic leaders do not support any form of ESCR and strictly observe the inviolability of embryonic life. While the ethical concerns of the Catholic respondents are in accordance with the standpoint of the Vatican, the Buddhist and the Hindu respondents have provided new insights on the subject, striking new frontiers in the ethics discussion...|$|R

When we consider the morality of each proposal in turn, we find as to several that what defends them also defends the use of <b>surplus</b> <b>embryos</b> and clones in general. That leaves no reason to abandon the general case for the special case of compromised life forms. Another of the proposals is morally inde-fensible. Still other proposed techniques would themselves use or risk using embryos, not to mention that they may fail to produce pluripotent cells of sufficient quality. We shall not achieve a moral gain by adopting any of these proposals in lieu of using donated embryos barred from the womb by donor instructions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{an effort}} to {{increase}} the credibility of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines established in Korea, obligatory registration was introduced by the Bioethics and Safety Act 2008, effective as of January 1, 2010. The DNA fingerprint, chromosome stability, expression of pluripotency markers, and contamination of mycoplasma of the submitted lines were analyzed by Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). The characterization data and ethical aspects, such as informed consent for donation of <b>surplus</b> <b>embryos,</b> were reviewed by a 10 -member advisory review committee for stem cell registry. A total of 55 domestic hESC lines were submitted for registration in 2010; among them 51 were registered. Among these submitted lines, 26 were additionally characterized by KCDC, while 25 lines previously characterized by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology were not additionally analyzed by KCDC. Registration completed an oversight system for embryo research by registering the products of licensed embryo research projects, making embryo research more transparent in Korea. Information about hESC lines {{is available at the}} website of the Korea Stem Cell Registry (kscr. nih. go. kr) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{success of}} {{assisted}} reproductive technologies (ARTs) worldwide {{has led to}} an accumulation of frozen <b>embryos</b> that are <b>surplus</b> to the reproductive needs of those for whom they were created. In these situations, couples must decide whether to discard them or donate them for scientific research or for use by other infertile couples. While legislation and regulation may limit the decisions that couples make, their decisions are often shaped by their religious beliefs. Unfortunately, health professionals, scientists and policy-makers are often unaware {{of the way in which}} faith traditions view ART and decisions concerning the ‘fate’ of <b>surplus</b> <b>embryos.</b> In this paper scholars representing six major religious traditions provide a commentary on a hypothetical case concerning the donation or destruction of excess ART embryos. These commentaries provide a rich account of religious perspectives on the status of the human embryo and an insight into the relevance of faith to health and policy decisions, particularly in reproductive medicine, ART and embryo research.

40|$|Many {{patients}} {{do not make}} a decision about the disposition of their <b>surplus</b> <b>embryos</b> until they are compelled to do so by statutory limits. In the current study, the characteristics of women who had conceived through in[*]vitro fertilisation (IVF) and who still had embryos stored (E-S; n[*]=[*] 26) 5 years after IVF were compared to a cohort comparison group (C-C; n[*]=[*] 40). At time 1 (T 1, 28 weeks pregnant) women completed questionnaires on personality traits (anxiety, locus of control and dependency) and participated in an interview on socio-demographic characteristics, family composition and stored embryos. At T 2 (5 years later) women were re-interviewed and asked about beliefs about the embryos. Women in the E-S group were significantly younger, had been married or living with their partner for fewer years and had had more children than the C-C group. Further, women in the E-S group {{were more likely to have}} an external locus of control and a dependent personality than women in the C-C group. Almost all women in the E-S group (88. 5 %) thought of their embryos as siblings to existing children, and reported thinking about the embryos occasionally (61. 5 %) or frequently (34. 6 %). The personality differences identified may suggest that women who still have embryos after the end of fertility treatment may be in need of decision support. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The Italian law {{regulating}} assisted reproductive {{technologies that}} came into force in 2004 restricts the number of fertilized oocytes per cycle to three, obliges the subsequent transfer of all resulting embryos and prohibits the freezing of <b>surplus</b> <b>embryos.</b> This study evaluates {{the impact of the}} law on severe oligozoospermic, cryptozoospermic, obstructive azoospermic and non-obstructive azoospermic patients. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection outcomes of 1066 cycles performed in the 4 years before the passing of the law were compared with 804 cycles performed in the 4 years after the law came to pass. Globally, analysis of clinical and obstetric outcomes showed a significant decrease in terms of pregnancy and delivery rates per cycle (17. 8 % versus 10. 9 % and 14. 2 % versus 8. 5 %, respectively) and per embryo transfer (18. 8 % versus 13. 8 % and 15. 0 % versus 10. 7 %, respectively), and a significant drop in multiple deliveries (35. 1 % versus 17. 6 %) in the post-law period. Cryptozoospermic and azoospermic couples were affected by the Italian law more than severe oligozoospermic couples. The results showed that the Italian law limits the efficiency of assisted reproduction treatment in couples with severe male factor. It is hoped that the Italian assisted reproductive technologies law is altered as soon as possible, allowing the insemination of more than three oocytes...|$|R
50|$|Using ART {{treatments}} such as IVF {{can result}} in one donor sample (or ejaculate) producing on average considerably more than one birth. However, {{the actual number of}} births per sample will depend on the actual ART method used, the age and medical condition of the female bearing the child, {{and the quality of the}} embryos produced by fertilization. Donor sperm is less commonly used for IVF treatments than for artificial insemination. This is because IVF treatments are usually required only when there is a problem with the female conceiving, or where there is a 'male factor problem' involving the female's partner. Donor sperm is also used for IVF in surrogacy arrangements where an embryo may be created in an IVF procedure using donor sperm and this is then implanted in a surrogate. In a case where IVF treatments are employed using donor sperm, <b>surplus</b> <b>embryos</b> may be donated to other women or couples and used in embryo transfer procedures. When donor sperm is used for IVF treatments, there is a risk that large numbers of children will be born from a single donor, and many sperm banks therefore limit the amount of semen from each donor which is prepared for IVF use, or they may restrict the period of time for which such a donor donates his sperm to perhaps as little as three months (about nine or ten ejaculates).|$|R

40|$|AbstractThere {{are several}} sources from which human {{embryonic}} stem cell (hESC) lines can be generated: <b>surplus</b> <b>embryos</b> after in vitro fertilization procedures, one- and three-pronuclear zygotes, early arrested or highly fragmented embryos that have reached the blastocyst stage, or otherwise chromosomally or genetically abnormal embryos after preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). We report on the efficiency of establishing hESC lines from blastocysts with proven meiotic or mitotic errors after sequential testing of both polar bodies and blastomere analysis on day 3. The success rate of establishing hESC lines originating from blastocysts carrying a meiotic error was as low as 2. 4 % and differed significantly from the success rate of establishing hESC lines originating from blastocysts with balanced meiotic errors (21. 6 %) or mitotic errors (after sequential testing (9. 1 %) and after blastomere testing alone (12. 2 %)). This suggests {{that it may be}} reasonable to apply sequential PGD prior to the initiation of hESC culture. Information about the karyotype may in the future help refine the methods and possibly improve the efficiency by which hESC lines are derived from embryos with prezygotic abnormalities. Additionally, it may in general prove very difficult to obtain abnormal hESC lines for scientific study from aneuploid PGD embryos, which will limit our ability to study the biological consequences of chromosomal abnormalities. Furthermore, the success rates for generating aneuploid cell lines originating from fertilized oocytes carrying a prezygotic nondisjunction error seem to mirror the miscarriage rates during pregnancy of embryos carrying such errors...|$|R
