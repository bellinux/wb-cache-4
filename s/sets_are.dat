5|$|A matroid is a {{mathematical}} structure in which certain sets of elements are defined to be independent, {{in such a}} way that the independent sets satisfy properties modeled after the properties of linear independence in a vector space. One of the standard examples of a matroid is the graphic matroid in which the independent <b>sets</b> <b>are</b> the sets of edges in forests of a graph; the matroid structure of forests is important in algorithms for computing the minimum spanning tree of the graph. Analogously, we may define matroids from pseudoforests.|$|E
5|$|Any {{directed}} graph {{may be made}} into a DAG by removing a feedback vertex set or a feedback arc set, a set of vertices or edges (respectively) that touches all cycles. However, the smallest such set is NP-hard to find. An arbitrary {{directed graph}} may also be transformed into a DAG, called its condensation, by contracting each of its strongly connected components into a single supervertex. When the graph is already acyclic, its smallest feedback vertex sets and feedback arc <b>sets</b> <b>are</b> empty, and its condensation is the graph itself.|$|E
5|$|As 27 of the 31 Inter-Capital <b>sets</b> <b>are</b> {{sufficient}} {{to operate the}} service, four are currently used by SNCF for domestic TGV services; one of these regularly operates a Paris–Lille shuttle. The Eurostar logos {{have been removed from}} these sets, but the base colours of white, black, and yellow remain. SNCF's lease of the sets is scheduled to last until 2011, with an option for a further two years.|$|E
5000|$|The {{family of}} sets with the {{property}} of Baire forms a σ-algebra. That is, the complement of an almost open <b>set</b> <b>is</b> almost open, and any countable union or intersection of almost open <b>sets</b> <b>is</b> again almost open. [...] Since every open <b>set</b> <b>is</b> almost open (the empty <b>set</b> <b>is</b> meager), it follows that every Borel <b>set</b> <b>is</b> almost open.|$|R

5|$|Debian offers DVD and CD {{images for}} {{installation}} {{that can be}} downloaded using BitTorrent or jigdo. Physical disks can also be bought from retailers. The full <b>sets</b> <b>are</b> made up of several discs (the amd64 port consists of 13 DVDs or 84 CDs), but only the first disc is required for installation, as the installer can retrieve software not contained in the first disc image from online repositories.|$|E
5|$|Expansion <b>sets</b> <b>are</b> {{currently}} {{released in}} a two-set block, {{starting with a}} large set and ending with a smaller one three months later. Prior to 2016, expansion sets were released in a three-set block (again, beginning with a larger set followed by two smaller sets). These sets consist almost exclusively of newly designed cards. Contrasting with the wide-ranging Core Set, each expansion is focused around a subset of mechanics and ties into a set storyline. Expansions also dedicate several cards {{to a handful of}} particular, often newly introduced, game mechanics.|$|E
5|$|The Bicentennial dollars {{were the}} first of the three {{denominations}} to be struck for distribution to the public; these were coined beginning in February 1975. The silver pieces were struck at San Francisco beginning on April 23, 1975. The Mint found that the copper nickel dollar was striking indistinctly, a problem not seen with the silver pieces. Brooks called a halt in production to allow Gasparro to modify the dies; the most noticeable change is that the revised issue, or Type II as it came to be known, have narrower, sharper lettering on the reverse. All silver pieces (struck only at San Francisco) are Type I; all three mints struck both Type I and Type II copper nickel pieces. All dollars included in 1975 proof <b>sets</b> <b>are</b> Type I; all those included in 1976 proof <b>sets</b> <b>are</b> Type II. The first Bicentennial dollars were released into circulation on October 13, 1975. Over 220 million were struck. The Bicentennial design was not used after 1976; sets of silver clad Bicentennial coins were sold by the Mint until sales were finally closed at the end of 1986.|$|E
50|$|The {{infusion}} <b>set</b> must <b>be</b> replaced regularly, usually every 2-3 days. Insulin absorption {{becomes less}} effective {{the longer the}} <b>set</b> <b>is</b> left in place, leading to poorer control of blood glucose. For this reason, {{the site of the}} infusion <b>set</b> <b>is</b> moved when the <b>set</b> <b>is</b> changed. Often a number of favorite sites for the infusion <b>set</b> <b>are</b> used on a rotation basis.|$|R
50|$|In metrizable spaces, every open <b>set</b> <b>is</b> an Fσ <b>set.</b> The {{complement}} of an Fσ <b>set</b> <b>is</b> a G&delta; <b>set.</b> In a metrizable space, any closed <b>set</b> <b>is</b> a Gδ <b>set.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In set theory, a {{hereditary}} set (or pure <b>set)</b> <b>is</b> a <b>set</b> whose elements <b>are</b> all hereditary <b>sets.</b> That <b>is,</b> {{all elements}} of the <b>set</b> <b>are</b> themselves <b>sets,</b> as <b>are</b> {{all elements of}} the elements, and so on.|$|R
5|$|The precise {{relationships}} between pterosaurs is still unsettled. Many studies of pterosaur {{relationships in the}} past have included limited data and were highly contradictory. However, newer studies using larger data <b>sets</b> <b>are</b> beginning to make things clearer. The cladogram (family tree) below follows a phylogenetic analysis presented by Andres & Myers in 2013.|$|E
5|$|The set {{depicting}} Katsuki Manor {{was based}} on the Katsura Imperial Villa in Kyoto. These <b>sets</b> <b>are</b> decorated with props evocative of feudal-era aristocrats, such as kimono and armor, personally chosen by Mizoguchi. The scene where the protagonists travel through Lake Biwa on a boat was in fact shot on a pool in the studio, with added smoke. The assistant directors had to push the boat through the cold waters. Miyagawa identified this as one of the scenes shot from a crane.|$|E
5|$|Dating from 857 of the Tang Dynasty, the Great East Hall (东大殿) is {{the third}} oldest dated wooden {{building}} in China after the main hall of the Nanchan Temple dated to 782, and the main hall of the Five Dragons Temple, dated to 831. The hall {{is located on the}} far east side of the temple, atop a large stone platform. It is a single storey structure measuring seven bays by four or 34 by 17.7 metres (110 by 58ft), and is supported by inner and outer sets of columns. On top of each column is a complicated set of brackets containing seven different bracket types that are one-third as high as the column itself. Supporting the roof of the hall, each of the bracket <b>sets</b> <b>are</b> connected by crescent shaped crossbeams, which create an inner ring above the inner set of columns and an outer ring above the outer columns. The hall has a lattice ceiling that conceals much of the roof frame from view. The hipped-roof and the extremely complex bracket <b>sets</b> <b>are</b> testament to the Great East Hall's importance as a structure during the Tang Dynasty. According to the 11th-century architectural treatise, Yingzao Fashi, the Great East Hall closely corresponds to a seventh rank building in a system of eight ranks. The high rank of the Great East Hall indicates that even in the Tang Dynasty it was an important building, and no other buildings from the period with such a high rank survive.|$|E

5|$|Onions may {{be grown}} from seed or from sets. Onion seeds are {{short-lived}} and fresh seeds germinate better. The seeds are sown thinly in shallow drills, thinning {{the plants in}} stages. In suitable climates, certain cultivars can be sown in late summer and autumn to overwinter {{in the ground and}} produce early crops the following year. Onion <b>sets</b> <b>are</b> produced by sowing seed thickly in early summer in poor soil and the small bulbs produced are harvested in the autumn. These bulbs are planted the following spring and grow into mature bulbs later in the year. Certain cultivars are used for this purpose and these may not have such good storage characteristics as those grown directly from seed.|$|E
5|$|The first twelve {{seasons of}} Degrassi: The Next Generation have been {{released}} on DVD. The box <b>sets</b> <b>are</b> released in Canada by Alliance Home Entertainment. In the United States, FUNimation Entertainment released the first six seasons and Echo Bridge Entertainment released seasons seven through twelve. Each season boxset includes extra features such as pictures, karaoke sessions, audition tapes, bloopers, deleted scenes and more. In Australia, seasons 1 to 4 were released by Umbrella Entertainment in 2010 and 2011. These DVDs are compatible with the region 4 code, which is in use in Australia, New Zealand, Oceania, Mexico, and Central and South America.|$|E
5|$|The {{onion fly}} (Delia antiqua) lays eggs on {{the leaves and}} stems {{and on the ground}} close to onion, shallot, leek, and garlic plants. The fly is {{attracted}} to the crop by the smell of damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning. Plants grown from <b>sets</b> <b>are</b> less prone to attack. The larvae tunnel into the bulbs and the foliage wilts and turns yellow. The bulbs are disfigured and rot, especially in wet weather. Control measures may include crop rotation, the use of seed dressings, early sowing or planting, and the removal of infested plants.|$|E
50|$|If a <b>set</b> of <b>sets</b> <b>is</b> {{infinite}} or {{contains an}} infinite element, then its union is infinite. The powerset of an infinite <b>set</b> <b>is</b> infinite. Any superset of an infinite <b>set</b> <b>is</b> infinite. If an infinite <b>set</b> <b>is</b> partitioned into finitely many subsets, {{then at least}} one of them must <b>be</b> infinite. Any <b>set</b> which can <b>be</b> mapped onto an infinite <b>set</b> <b>is</b> infinite. The Cartesian product of an infinite set and a nonempty <b>set</b> <b>is</b> infinite. The Cartesian product of an infinite number of sets each containing at least two elements is either empty or infinite; if the axiom of choice holds, then it is infinite.|$|R

5|$|With Lorentz symmetry, {{additional}} structures {{come into}} play. They {{are defined by}} the set of light cones (see image). The light-cones define a causal structure: for each event A, there {{is a set of}} events that can, in principle, either influence or be influenced by A via signals or interactions that do not need to travel faster than light (such as event B in the image), and a set of events for which such an influence is impossible (such as event C in the image). These <b>sets</b> <b>are</b> observer-independent. In conjunction with the world-lines of freely falling particles, the light-cones can be used to reconstruct the space–time's semi-Riemannian metric, at least up to a positive scalar factor. In mathematical terms, this defines a conformal structure or conformal geometry.|$|E
