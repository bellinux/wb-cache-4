500|$|The most {{meaningful}} {{outcome of the}} Franklin expedition was the mapping of several thousand miles of hitherto unsurveyed coastline by expeditions searching for Franklin's lost ships and crew. As Richard Cyriax noted, [...] "the loss of the expedition probably added much more [...] knowledge than its successful return would have done". At the same time, it largely quelled the Admiralty's appetite for Arctic exploration. There was a gap of many years before the Nares expedition and when Nares declared there was [...] "no thoroughfare" [...] to the North Pole, his words {{marked the end of}} the Royal Navy's historical involvement in Arctic exploration, {{the end of an era}} in which such exploits were widely seen by the British public as worthy expenditures of human effort and monetary resources. As a writer for The Athenaeum put it, [...] "We think that we can fairly make out the account between the cost and results of these Arctic Expeditions, and ask whether it is worth while to risk <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> which is so difficult of attainment, and when attained, is so worthless." [...] The navigation of the Northwest Passage in 1903–05 by Roald Amundsen with the Gjøa expedition effectively ended the centuries-long quest for the Northwest Passage.|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{seems so}} odd {{that you should}} care <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> sort of thing," [...] Selina remarked. [...] "As a rule it is the frumpy and uninteresting people who go in for visiting the poor and doing good, isn't it? You seem so young, and so--oh, I don't think I'd better go on." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{is a very}} {{significant}} step, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> Catechumens (unbaptized): ”One who dies during the Catechumenate receives a Christian burial.” ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I am {{convinced}} that two small ranches have been temporarily inundated, and six or seven benefited. <b>So</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> side of the question. I must now ascertain whether the work is {{carried out in the}} most efficient manner, and how many have suffered in minor ways by the contractors' willful neglect, as the petitioners allege." ...|$|E
60|$|Our Society hath not yet renewed their meetings. I hope {{we shall}} {{continue}} to do some good this winter; and Lord Treasurer promises the Academy for reforming our language shall soon go forward. I must now go hunt those dry letter for materials. You will see something very notable, I hope. <b>So</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> God Almighty bless you.|$|E
6000|$|The {{mention of}} money cast a chill upon their talk; and Mrs. Lander said gloomily, [...] "I don't know as I ca'e <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> will Mr. Milray made for me, after all. I {{did want to}} say ten {{thousand}} apiece for Mr. Landa's relations; but I hated to befo'e him; I'd told the whole kit of 'em so much about you, and I knew what they would think." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> saying <b>that!</b> I hope it {{will pass}} off in unclouded brilliancy; it will, if I can make it. Why, hallo! They're {{on the other side}} of the street yet, and looking about as if they were lost." ...|$|R
50|$|Most {{commercial}} fisheries do not target Alaska plaice, {{but many are}} caught as bycatch by commercial trawlers trying to catch other bottom fish. Thus, many Alaska plaice get caught anyway - <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>so</b> <b>that,</b> <b>for</b> example, the 2005 total allowable catch in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands management area (BSAI) was reached {{before the end of}} May of that year.|$|R
5000|$|Pie guitarist Clem Clempson {{has said}} {{it is one of}} the tracks he would most like his career to be remembered by. But the {{predominant}} group personality shown through by the song is Marriott's; <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> example when years later Clempson was asked about efforts to reform the group without Marriott, he simply declaimed, [...] "It's a waste of time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To a false and rotten society, yes--you are," [...] he returned. [...] "But Mel, {{that society}} is a mass of maggots. It is such women as you, such men as Blair, who carry the spirit onward.... <b>So</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> I have spoken to try to show you where I hold you. I do not call your--your trouble a blunder, or downfall, or dishonor. I call it a misfortune because--because--" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> But {{that was}} {{only a part of}} Fortune's kindnesses. To have {{discovered}} {{on the first day of}} their association the correct method of handling and reducing to subjection his irascible employer was an even greater boon. A prolonged association with Mr. Peters on the lines in which their acquaintance had begun would have been extremely trying. Now, by virtue of a fortunate stand at the outset, he had spiked the millionaire's guns.|$|E
6000|$|... "Michael," [...] Mrs. Trevennack began, {{as soon as}} {{they were}} alone, rising up from her chair and coming over toward him tenderly, [...] "I was horribly afraid you were going to break out before those two young men on the cliff to-day. I saw you were just on the very brink of it. But you {{resisted}} bravely. Thank you <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> You're a dear good fellow. I was so pleased with you and so proud of you." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{recollection}} {{seemed to}} have amused her <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> the moment I held my breath and ignored her question.|$|R
6000|$|... "She owns {{most of this}} {{parish and}} has done <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> us <b>that</b> we can very well look leniently on a little weakness--her wish that the future {{inhabitants}} of the place shall not remember her as a middle-aged woman not remarkable for good looks--'funny,' as you just now said." ...|$|R
60|$|Her {{distress}} {{was very}} poignant, and it affected him <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> {{a moment he}} could not trust himself to answer her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] said Brigida. [...] "Her {{eyes were}} {{also of the}} same color as the late countess's; she wore yellow of the same shade as the hangings in the late countess's room, and she had on, under her yellow mask, the colorless wax model of the late countess's face, now in your friend's hand. <b>So</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> part of the secret. Nothing remains now to be cleared up but the mystery of who the lady was. Have the goodness, sir, to push that bag an inch or two nearer my way, and I shall be delighted to tell you." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{was blamed}} {{by a common}} friend for asking you {{to give me a}} testimonial; in the {{circumstances}} he thought it was indelicate. [...] Lest, by some calamity, you should ever have felt the same way, I must say in two words how the matter appeared to me. That silly story of the election altered in no tittle the value of your testimony: <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> On the other hand, it led me to take quite a particular pleasure in asking you to give it; and so much for the other. I trust, even if you cannot share it, you will understand my view.|$|E
6000|$|... "Harm! nae great harm; but I hear he says I staid {{away from}} the Ba'spiel on Fastern's E'en, for fear of him; {{and it was only}} for fear of the Country Keeper, for there was a warrant against me. I'll stand Hobbie's feud, and a' his clan's. But it's not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>that,</b> as to gie him a lesson not to let his tongue gallop ower freely about his betters. I trow he will hae lost the best pen-feather o' his wing before to-morrow morning.--Farewell, Elshie; there's some canny boys waiting for me down amang the shaws, owerby; I will see you as I come back, and bring ye a blithe tale in return for your leech-craft." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{girl was}} so evidently terrified {{at the idea}} of going up the secret staircase, and she had already done <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> us, <b>that</b> we felt it would not be right to urge her further, and {{we looked at each other}} for a moment or two in silence. Then Polly said,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Romance? Bah! It's {{the most}} ridiculous unreality in the world. If you had <b>so</b> <b>much</b> sympathy <b>for</b> <b>that</b> stupid girl, in that poor woman in her anxiety about her disappointment, why hadn't you a little for her sick husband? But a husband is nothing--when you have got him." ...|$|R
60|$|So they went, {{and soon}} {{were engaged in}} contemplation of the stars, an {{occupation}} which absorbed Godfrey <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> a while he forgot all his troubles.|$|R
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> {{consideration}} of us nationally, which I {{do not think}} England, in her quality of hostess, is bound to show her several American guests. I do not blame her that the sympathy of her greatest sons, {{so far as it}} has been shown us nationally, has been shown in her interest, which they believed the supreme interest of mankind, rather than in our interest, which it is for us to believe the supreme interest of mankind. Even when they are talking America they are thinking England; they cannot otherwise; they must; it is imperative; it is essential that they should. We talk of England on the same terms, with our own inner version.|$|E
6000|$|... 166 “I am {{glad that}} you are in love—’twill cure you at least of the [...] spleen, which has a bad effect on both man and woman—I myself must [...] even have some Dulcinea in my head; it harmonizes the soul; and in [...] these cases I first {{endeavour}} to make the lady believe so, or [...] rather, I begin first to make myself believe that I am in love—but I [...] carry on my affairs quite in the French way, sentimentally—l’amour [...] (say they) n’est rien sans sentiment. Now, notwithstanding they [...] make such a pother about the word, they have no precise idea [...] annexed to it.

6000|$|... "Right? Do {{you suppose}} a man gets his {{reputation}} by making mistakes? You're {{one of the}} new generation, Master Arnold. You can all of you stare at a famous man; but you haven't an atom of respect for his fame. If Shakspeare came to life again, and talked of playwriting, the first pretentious nobody who sat opposite at dinner would differ with him as composedly as he might differ with you and me. Veneration is dead among us; the present age has buried it, without a stone to mark the place. <b>So</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>that!</b> Let's get back to Blanche. I suppose you can guess what the painful subject is that's dwelling on her mind? Miss Silvester has baffled me, and baffled the Edinburgh police. Blanche discovered that we had failed last night and Blanche received that letter this morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is manly {{of you to}} talk in {{this way}} to me," [...] said Philip, bitterly, his whole frame shaken by violent emotions. [...] "Giants have an immemorial right to stupidity and insolent abuse. You are {{incapable}} even of understanding what I feel for your sister. I feel <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> her <b>that</b> I could even desire to be at friendship with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Tito," [...] said Romola, [...] "my godfather {{will not}} oppose {{what my father}} firmly wills. And it is your will that I should marry Tito--is it not true, father? Nothing has ever come to me before that I have wished for strongly: I {{did not think it}} {{possible}} that I could care <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> anything <b>that</b> could happen to myself." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Lord bless ye, no, sir," [...] {{answered}} the interpreter; [...] "they don't care a straw about the house, or any house. There's Flintyheart, in particular; he's a chief {{that you can}} no more move with riches and large housen, and sichlike matters, than {{you can make the}} Mississippi run up stream. When we went to Uncle Sam's house, at Washington, he scarce condescended to look at it; and the Capital had no more effect on any on 'em, than {{if it had been a}} better sort of wigwam; not <b>so</b> <b>much,</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> matter, as Injins be curious in wigwams. What's put 'em up on a trail like, just now, is the knowledge that this is the spot where a battle was fit, something like ninety seasons ago, in which the Upright Onondago was consarned, as well as some of their own people on t'other side--that's what's put 'em in commotion." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> {{night and}} for several others that followed. As for the days they went by pleasantly and idly. Heda walked about on her father's arm, conversed in {{friendly}} fashion with the doctor, always watching him, I noticed, as a cat watches a dog that she knows is waiting an opportunity to spring, {{and for the rest}} associated with us as much as she could. Particularly did she seem to take refuge behind my own insignificance, having, I suppose, {{come to the conclusion that}} I was a harmless person who might possibly prove useful. But all the while I felt that the storm was banking up. Indeed Marnham himself, at any rate to a great extent, played the part of the cloud-compelling Jove, for soon it became evident to me, and without doubt to Dr. Rodd also, that he was encouraging the intimacy between his daughter and Anscombe by every means in his power.|$|E
60|$|WISE. I will {{assure you}} {{it is as}} I say. For you must know that Badman's ways suited not with his master's gains. Could he have done as the damsel that we read of, Acts 16:16, did, to wit, fill his master's purse with his badness, he had {{certainly}} been his white-boy, {{but it was not}} so with young Badman; and, therefore, though his master and he did suit well enough in the main, yet in this and that point they differed. Young Badman was for neglecting of his master's business, for going to the whore-house, for beguiling of his master, for attempting to debauch his daughters, and the like. No marvel then if they disagreed in these points. Not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> his master had an antipathy against the fact itself, for he could do so when he was an apprentice; but for that his servant by his sin made spoil of his commodities, &c., and so damnified his master.|$|E
60|$|Geoffrey {{treated the}} matter lightly. His brother was, however, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> shocked, <b>that</b> <b>for</b> {{a little while}} he joined his father, {{swearing}} he would never again rebel.|$|R
50|$|Tho' he {{for many}} years was {{incapable}} to attend, the Court musicians had <b>so</b> <b>much</b> value <b>for</b> him, <b>that</b> advantage was not taken, but he received his salary as they were paid.|$|R
50|$|Historically {{a part of}} Lancashire, Castleton's {{early history}} is marked by {{its status as a}} {{township}} within the ancient parish of Rochdale. Prior to merging with the County Borough of Rochdale in 1900, Castleton experienced rapid growth during the 19th century as a mill town in its own right, facilitated for the most part by the construction of the Rochdale Canal which is routed through the area. Castleton's growth was significant; <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>so,</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> a time it was almost the same size of nearby Rochdale.|$|R
