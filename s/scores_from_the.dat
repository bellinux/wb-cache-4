5|$|Apart {{from video}} games and toys, the series has also seen the release of its films' soundtracks. In 1982, Gramavision Records {{released}} a LP album of selected pieces of Harry Manfredini's <b>scores</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first three films. On September 27, 2005, BSX Records released a limited edition CD of Fred Mollin's scores. On January 13, 2012, La-La Land Records released a limited edition 6-CD boxset containing Manfredini's <b>scores</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first six films. Beginning with Jason Goes to Hell, each film in the series has had their musical score and soundtrack released for sale.|$|E
5|$|Charles X Gustav then granted Frederick William full {{sovereignty}} in the Duchy of Prussia {{in return for}} military aid, and in the Treaty of Radnot allied himself with the Transylvanian George II Rákóczi who invaded Poland–Lithuania from the southeast. John II Vasa found an ally in Leopold I of Habsburg, whose armies crossed into Poland–Lithuania from the southwest. This triggered Frederick III of Denmark's invasion of the Swedish mainland {{in the spring of}} 1657, in an attempt to settle old <b>scores</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Torstenson War while Sweden was busy elsewhere. Brandenburg left the alliance with Sweden when granted full {{sovereignty in}} the Duchy of Prussia by the Polish king in the treaties of Wehlau and Bromberg.|$|E
5|$|The {{interview}} and speech events are {{graded by two}} to three judges. The <b>scores</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> judges are averaged to give a maximum of 1,000 points per event. The essay is graded with a rubric and is read by two different judges whose scores are then averaged. If {{the difference between the}} judges' scores differs by 200 points or more, then a third reader is asked to grade the student's essay. The two scores that are closest in value are averaged to give the final score.|$|E

5|$|A common {{situation}} in ski jumping, and especially ski flying {{due to the}} magnified risks overall, arises when unfavourable weather conditions cause a competition to be cut short or cancelled completely; it is also not uncommon for an entire event to be cancelled. Reasons include strong winds, a lack of (or too much) snow, and poor visibility for athletes or judges. In {{the case of a}} shortened competition, the <b>scores</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first round – if completed – are used to determine the final result. This is called a single-round competition and still counts towards both the Ski Flying and Ski Jumping World Cup. For the World Championships, if one of the two competitions is cancelled, the final result will be based on the competition that took place.|$|E
5|$|Crime and Dissonance, a {{collection}} of Ennio Morricone's film <b>scores</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1970s, was conceived as a follow-up to Dagored releases Morricone 2000 and Morricone 2001. However, that label abandoned the project, and Mike Patton of Ipecac Recordings decided to release it instead. Morricone had no input in the project; instead the track listing was assembled by Alan Bishop. Bishop had previously assembled the Morricone 2000 and Morricone 2001 collections as well. All three compilations cover a roughly coterminous time period, spanning the late 1960s to the early 1980s, but concentrating primarily on the early 1970s. Bishop {{had been given a}} list of films whose scores were available to use in the collection; he set about compiling the two-disc set from there. However, the final song on the album, an eleven-minute section from the soundtrack to Un uomo da rispettare, {{was not included in the}} list of available material. The project was delayed for some time while Bishop waited for record label Sugar Music to license the song.|$|E
5|$|Each {{of the ten}} {{events is}} worth 1,000 points, for a {{possible}} 10,000-point individual total. Only the top two <b>scores</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Honors, Scholastic and Varsity divisions are counted for the team score. Until 2013, 60,000 was the maximum possible team score. In 2013, Super Quiz became a 10,000 point event that only counts for the team score, making the maximum possible team score 70,000. With the exception of math and Super Quiz, the objective tests each have 50 questions worth 20 points a piece. The math test is weighted more heavily, with 35 questions worth approximately 28.6 points per question. Until 2013, the Super Quiz written test contained 40 questions, each worth 15 points. Depending on the state director, the relay component of Super Quiz contained either 5 or 10 questions, each worth 80 or 40 points respectively. Starting in 2013, the Super Quiz contained only the relay component with 5 or 10 questions, each worth approximately 333.3 or 166.7 questions respectively. The written test was sometimes omitted {{at the state level}} even before 2013 if a state director wished to weigh the Super Quiz Relay more heavily. Perfect scores of 1,000 in events are recorded regularly, and there have been cases of dozens of medal winners for a single event because of perfect and near-perfect scores. Gold, silver and bronze medals are awarded in each event and for each division (Honors, Scholastic, and Varsity). All tying participants are awarded medals.|$|E
50|$|Like {{the first}} film, Bizarro Classic {{utilizes}} <b>the</b> <b>score</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1948 Superman serial composed by Mischa Bakaleinikoff. In addition, the film uses Leon Klatzkin's <b>score</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 1950s TV series Adventures of Superman.|$|R

50|$|The {{film was}} {{composed}} by John Debney, who replaced John Powell <b>from</b> <b>the</b> previous three films due to Powell being busy with other projects. However, most Powell's <b>score</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> third {{was included in}} the film, along with David Newman's <b>score</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first film.|$|R

50|$|After {{the judges}} and contestants' scores, Apostolia and Josephine were tied with 43 points. Fasoulis, {{who was the}} {{president}} of the judges for the week, chose to give the final 9 points to Apostolia and the 10 points to Josephine. After the combined final scores, three contestants had 12 points. In tie, the one who got <b>the</b> highest <b>score</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> audience got the highest final place, the one with <b>the</b> second highest <b>score</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> audience the second highest final place and the one with <b>the</b> third highest <b>score</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> audience the last final place of the three.|$|R

50|$|Given the {{difficulty}} of <b>scoring</b> directly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> point due to the distance to <b>the</b> goal, goals <b>scored</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> point are typically either on screens, or are tipped goals.|$|R

25|$|In general, having {{good grades}} does not {{necessarily}} translate into having good aggregate <b>scores.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> data, {{we can see that}} students with lower grades have achieved better aggregate scores than others with better grades. For example, a particular Student X scored 233 with grades of 2As and 2Bs, bettering a Student Y who scored 221 with 4As.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{having a}} {{national}} television contract, the AFL often found itself {{trying to gain}} a foothold, only to come up against roadblocks. For example, CBS-TV, which broadcast NFL games, ignored and did not report <b>scores</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> innovative AFL, on orders from the NFL. It was only after the merger agreement was announced that CBS began to give AFL scores.|$|E

25|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in European Journal of Personality, Heiner Rindermann compared the IQ <b>scores</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> book to a large number of international student assessment studies on subjects such as reading, mathematics, science, and problem solving, and found them to be highly intercorrelated. Statistical analyses indicated that the results could be explained by an underlying general cognitive ability. More than 30 commentaries on Rindermann's findings were published in the same issue of the journal.|$|E
