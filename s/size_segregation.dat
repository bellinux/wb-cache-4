50|$|It is {{difficult}} to compare the two cases directly, as their behavior depends on the situation. For example, in the best case for a garbage collecting system, allocation just increments a pointer, but in the best case for manual heap allocation, the allocator maintains freelists of specific sizes and allocation only requires following a pointer. However, this <b>size</b> <b>segregation</b> usually cause a large degree of external fragmentation, which can have an adverse impact on cache behaviour. Memory allocation in a garbage collected language may be implemented using heap allocation behind the scenes (rather than simply incrementing a pointer), so the performance advantages listed above don't necessarily apply in this case.

Segregation rates and patterns obtained from experiments are compared to numerical simulations performed with a two-dimensional multi-fluid Eulerian model, that uses closure laws according to the kinetic theory of granular flow. It is demonstrated that prediction of segregation is a rather severe test case for fundamental hydrodynamic models, since bubble dynamics and momentum transfer between particles of different classes have to be modelled correctly. At all gas velocities segregation rates predicted by the multi-fluid model were much higher than those observed in experiments. At gas velocities higher than the minimum fluidisation velocity of the largest particles the model still predicts segregation, when it does not occur in experiments.

The comparisons of the simulated and experimental angle of repose and <b>size</b> <b>segregation</b> indices showed good agreement, demonstrating that the developed model is capable of predicting the behaviour of iron ore granules during pile formation. The simulation results show that the angle of repose of iron ore granules was greatly influenced by granule size, sliding and rolling friction coefficients. A decrease in granule size or an increase in either the sliding or rolling friction coefficients significantly increased the kinetic energy dissipation rate of the discharged granules during the packing process. Therefore, an increase in granule pile stability was observed. The simulation results also demonstrated the presence of significant <b>size</b> <b>segregation</b> of iron ore granules in the pile in the horizontal direction.

40|$|The minimum {{fluidization}} {{behavior of}} five different binary-solid systems {{with a wide}} range of composition is experimentally investigated by carrying out slow defluidization of an initially fluidized bed. The size ratios of these binaries vary from 4 to 10 while their buoyed-density ratios vary from 0. 22 to 0. 52 such that their larger components are lighter and smaller ones are denser. The difference in the physical properties of the two constituent solid phases of the fluidized bed is found to strongly influence the evolution of the packing structure, and consequently the minimum fluidization velocity during the slow defluidization process. For binaries with the same <b>size</b> ratio, <b>segregation</b> increases with the decrease in their buoyed-density ratios. On the other hand, even for binaries with large difference in their densities, increasing the size ratio enhances the mixing. Depending upon the composition of the bed, a completely mixed defluidized structure sometimes develops for high size-ratio binaries. Finally, a simple correlation is proposed that can better describe the present minimum fluidization velocity data than other existing correlations...|$|R

40|$|Southern blot {{analysis}} was used to quantify the extent of mtDNA D-loop length variation in two populations of white sturgeon, Acipenser transmontanus. Over 42 % of individuals were heteroplasmic for up to six different mtDNA length variants attributable to varying copy numbers of an 82 -bp repeat sequence. Chi-square analyses revealed that the frequencies of length genotypes and the incidence of heteroplasmy were significantly different between Fraser and Columbia River sturgeon populations but not between restriction site haplotypes. Heteroplasmic fish have, on average, higher copy number than homoplasmic fish. Forty-five of 101 homoplasmic individuals carry only a single copy of the repeat, while none of the 73 heteroplasmic fish has the single repeat as the predominant variant. On the basis of differences in frequency distributions of copy number within and between fish, we suggest that (1) heteroplasmy is maintained by high recurrent mutation of multiple copy genomes, favoring increased copy number and (2) the mutation pressure toward higher copy number heteroplasmy is partially offset by selection to reduced genome <b>size</b> and <b>segregation</b> to the homoplasmic condition...|$|R

Shoal encounters staged within an experimental arena showed shoal fission (but not fusion) events to be an important mechanism in generating phenotypic assortment.
