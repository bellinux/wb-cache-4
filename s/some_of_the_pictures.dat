She is {{cheerful and}} {{energetic}} and is {{constantly on the}} lookout for any good photo opportunities which causes her to regularly come into contact with the disciplinary committee and/or the student council. She {{and the members of the}} photography club run an underground website that sells voyeuristic pictures of the school's female students online by using the club's all-female members to take candid pictures of other students or set up hidden cameras in the toilets and changing rooms but Honoka later reveals that <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> were faked by using the club's members as models and then photo-shopping other students' faces.

25|$|During the Second World War, the Penrhos College {{site was}} taken over by the {{government}} for Ministry of Food use. The Duke of Devonshire, anticipating that schoolgirls would make better tenants than soldiers, offered Chatsworth House {{for the use of the}} school. The contents of the house were packed away in eleven days and 300 girls and their teachers moved in for a six-year stay. The whole of the house was used, including the state rooms, which were turned into dormitories. Condensation from the breath of the sleeping girls caused fungus to grow behind <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures.</b> The house was not very comfortable for so many people, with a shortage of hot water, but there were compensations, such as skating on the Canal Pond. The girls grew vegetables in the garden as a contribution to the war effort.|$|E

While heralded by many as outstanding colour photographs, they were harshly criticized by Susan Sontag, who claimed in a review that they were further evidence of Riefenstahl's [...] "fascist aesthetics". The Art Director's Club of Germany awarded Riefenstahl a gold medal for the best photographic achievement of 1975. [...] She also sold <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> to German magazines. She photographed the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, and rock star Mick Jagger {{along with his wife}} Bianca for The Sunday Times. Years later, Riefenstahl photographed Las Vegas entertainers Siegfried & Roy. She was guest of honour at the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, Canada.|$|E

500|$|On January 21, 2014, an {{anonymous}} poster started a thread on /b/ identifying a student named Westley Sullivan who apparently {{went to the}} same high school as the poster. The original post included a link to Westley Sullivan's Facebook profile, which has since been taken down, and a screenshot of a post which said [...] "if fairview isnt closed tomorrow im going to blow it up", referring to Sullivan's high school, Fairview High School, in Boyd County, Kentucky. A few anonymous individuals went to Sullivan's Facebook profile and found his address, phone number, school ID number, school schedule and teachers, and other personal information. Information like his teachers and ID number had been posted directly, and the more personal information like his address was found in the EXIF data of <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> posted on his profile. These individuals then contacted Fairview school officials and the local police department, as well as the FBI. The next day it was learned that police had arrested Sullivan in his home and he had been charged with 2nd degree terroristic threatening, a Class D felony in Kentucky.|$|E
500|$|Some {{observers}} thought Schumacher, a gay man, added possible homoerotic innuendo in the storyline. James Berardinelli {{questioned the}} [...] "random amount [...] of rubber nipples and camera angle close-ups of the Dynamic Duo's butts and Bat-crotches." [...] Similar to Batman Forever, this primarily included {{the decision to}} add nipples and enlarged codpieces to Batman and Robin suits. Schumacher stated, [...] "I {{had no idea that}} putting nipples on the Batsuit and Robin suit were going to spark international headlines. The bodies of the suits come from ancient Greek statues, which display perfect bodies. They are anatomically correct." [...] Chris O'Donnell, who portrayed Robin, felt [...] "it wasn't so much the nipples that bothered me. It was the codpiece. The press obviously played it up and made it a big deal, especially with Joel directing. I didn't think twice about the controversy, but going back and looking and seeing <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures,</b> it was very unusual." [...] George Clooney joked, [...] "Joel Schumacher told me we never made another Batman film because Batman was gay". Clooney himself has spoken critically of the film, saying, [...] "I think we might have killed the franchise", and called it [...] "a waste of money".|$|E
500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximate}} 1000 feet long, {{was released}} on July 8, 1910. Theaters in Indiana and Pennsylvania were among those which advertised the film, one specifically focusing on the film having dealing with [...] "the labor question". A review in The Moving Picture News was contained detailed praise of the film's relevance and success in portraying the subject. The reviewer states, [...] "This film strikes home. ... The situation has been lived in New York City. The strike and its miseries are not forgotten. Whoever arranged the story had a big, tender heart and knew what appeals to the masses. The glee with which the superintendent's discomfiture was hailed by the audience spoke volumes. We wish <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> were not quite so vividly black and white. Mayhap the tenseness of the situation hit the cameraman. Be that as it may, {{one thing is certain}} - there is no melodrama, but scenes out of real life." [...] While the reviewer in this case refers to the scenario being drawn from real life, the happy ending is termed as a fantasy by reviewer in The Moving Picture World who states, [...] " [...] of those pictures which thrill one despite their improbability. It may go in stories but never in fact, that an owner of a factory marries one of his girl employees, and a strike leader at that..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Von Däniken {{brought the}} Nazca Lines to public {{prominence}} in Chariots of the Gods? with his proposal that {{the lines were}} built on instructions from extraterrestrial beings as airfields for their spaceships. In his 1998 book Arrival of The Gods, he added that <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> depicted extraterrestrials. The idea did not originate with von Däniken; it began after people who first saw the lines from the air made joking comparisons to Martian [...] "canals", and had already been published by others. Descriptions of some Nazca line photos in Chariots of the Gods? contain significant inaccuracies. One, for example, purporting to demonstrate markings of a modern airport, was actually the knee joint {{of one of the}} bird figures, and was quite small in size. Von Däniken said that this was an [...] "error" [...] in the first edition, but it has not been corrected in later editions.|$|E

2500|$|According to Chinese {{advertisements}} released during various defense / aerospace / electronic {{exhibitions in}} the past, conversion kits {{have been developed}} for destroyers to deploy multiple UAVs. The developers of both the JRSCCS and the combat data system have claimed that their products could handle the information needed to control UAVs. [...] However, {{it is highly unlikely that}} any long range UAVs will ever be deployed on board this class because the complete handling system to support these large UAVs would need the entire hangar, thus displacing the only helicopter on board. [...] Chinese governmental media, however, did release photos of a variety of propeller driven light UAVs being launched from destroyers and claimed that these light UAVs could be deployed on every [...] destroyer class currently in Chinese service, and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> have depicted some UAVs carry laser targeting pods, providing guidance for laser guided projectiles. [...] However, as of mid-2007, it still can not be confirmed that if any light UAVs has been on board Type 052C class on a regular basis. [...] The lack of regular deployment of UAVs on board only seems to confirm the claim that the laser guided projectiles for the main gun are not deployed due to the lack of associating guidance equipment. [...] On August 17, 2008, another type of UAV named as Hummingbird carrying electro-optical pod were deployed on board for the successful test of a new data link developed by China Northern Co. (中国北方公司). [...] The new data link is a two-way real-time encrypted data link designed to replace the current HN-900 data link, and it is designated as NCTDL, short for Naval Common Tactical Data Link. [...] The new data link is claimed by many Chinese to be at least equal to the Link 16, and even comparable to Link 22, but such claims have yet to be verified by both the Chinese government and sources outside China. [...] However, it is certain that the new data link will replace HN-900 currently in service on board PLAN ships.|$|E
2500|$|These {{laws have}} been {{recorded}} in the media being put into play in Uppsala: the district court punished {{a man with a}} monetary fine and probation for possession of manga-style images. This was appealed and taken to the Court of Appeal. In court, Judge [...] stated that a [...] "person" [...] (as in the definition of a [...] "child") is a human being. The man possessing the illustrations, as well as his lawyer, stated that a comic character is not a person (a comic character is a comic character and nothing else) and that a person does not have cat ears, giant eyes, or a tail and that a person has a nose. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pictures</b> featured illustrations of characters with these unusual body parts. The prosecutor and an expert on child pornography argued that these body parts had no effect and that the comic characters indeed were persons. As examples of what is not a person, the child pornography expert mentioned The Simpsons and Donald Duck. The Court of Appeal upheld the former verdict, for 39 of the 51 pictures, and the monetary fine was reduced. It was immediately further appealed to the Supreme Court. While the Prosecutor General agreed with the verdict of the Court of Appeal, he still recommended that the Supreme Court hear the case, to clarify the issue, and the Supreme Court decided to do so. On 15 June 2012, the Supreme Court found him not guilty. They decided that the images were not realistic and could not be mistaken for real children, and that they therefore could not be counted as exceptions to the constitutional law of freedom of speech. One picture was still considered realistic enough to be defined as child pornography according to Swedish law. However, his possession of it was considered defensible through his occupation as a professional expert of Japanese culture, particularly manga.|$|E
