40|$|The NCN 5150 is a single-chip {{integrated}} <b>slave</b> <b>transceiver</b> {{for use in}} two-wire Meter Bus (M-BUS) slave {{devices and}} repeaters. The transceiver provides all of the functions needed to satisfy the European Standards EN 13757 − 2 and EN 1434 − 3 describing the physical layer requirements for M-BUS. It includes a programmable power level of up to 2 (SOIC version) or 6 (NQFP version) unit loads, which are available for use in external circuits through a 3. 3 V LDO regulator. The NCN 5150 can provide communication up to the maximum M-BUS communication speed of 38, 400 baud (half-duplex) ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel architecture of Inter Integrated Circuit (I 2 C) slave module for embedded processor at protocol level to provide flexibility. The internals of modular description follows {{higher level of}} abstraction in Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL) to provide a technology independent design for Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation using Xilinx ISE 12. 1. A brief contrast analysis {{has been carried out}} from logic synthesis results obtained by targeting the process technologies of 90 nm, 65 nm, 45 nm and 40 nm individually on Xilinx FPGAs. The behavioral model has been simulated to verify the complete functionality of I 2 C serial transmission protocol through the instantiation of slave module in a top-level stimulus block. One-hot Finite State Machine (FSM) encoding scheme is being adopted for <b>slave</b> <b>transceiver</b> to exhibit the I 2 C cycle operation.

40|$|A {{prototype}} wireless data-acquisition {{system has}} been developed as a potential replacement for a wired data-acquisition system heretofore used in testing rocket engines. The traditional use of wires to connect sensors, signal-conditioning circuits, and data acquisition circuitry is time-consuming and prone to error, especially when, {{as is often the}} case, many sensors are used in a test. The system includes one master and multiple slave nodes. The master node communicates with a computer via an Ethernet connection. The slave nodes are powered by rechargeable batteries and are packaged in weatherproof enclosures. The master unit and each of the slave units are equipped with a time-modulated ultra-wide-band (TMUWB) radio transceiver, which spreads its RF energy over several gigahertz by transmitting extremely low-power and super-narrow pulses. In this prototype system, each slave node can be connected to as many as six sensors: two sensors can be connected directly to analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) in the slave node and four sensors can be connected indirectly to the ADCs via signal conditioners. The maximum sampling rate for streaming data from any given sensor is about 5 kHz. The bandwidth of one channel of the TM-UWB radio communication system is sufficient to accommodate streaming of data from five slave nodes when they are fully loaded with data collected through all possible sensor connections. TM-UWB radios have a much higher spatial capacity than traditional sinusoidal wave-based radios. Hence, this TM-UWB wireless data-acquisition can be scaled to cover denser sensor setups for rocket engine test stands. Another advantage of TM-UWB radios is that it will not interfere with existing wireless transmission. The maximum radio-communication range between the master node and a slave node for this prototype system is about 50 ft (15 m) when the master and <b>slave</b> <b>transceivers</b> are equipped with small dipole antennas. The range can be increased by changing to larger antennas and/or greater transmission power. The battery life of a slave node ranges from about six hours during operation at full capacity to as long as three days when the system is in a "sleep" mode used to conserve battery charge during times between setup and rocket-engine testing. Batteries can be added to prolong operational lifetimes. The radio transceiver dominates the power consumption...|$|R
