40|$|Abstract only availableFaculty Mentor: Dr. Carlos Sun, EngineeringMy {{research}} {{evaluated the}} safety and efficiency impacts of the St. Louis Motorist Assist, a program of the Missouri Department of Transportation. The program's purpose is to improve freeway safety and expedite the flow of high-volume traffic by assisting disabled motorists, clearing freeways of stalled vehicles and debris, and assisting emergency personnel at accident locations. Similar programs exist in most major cities, and all previous evaluations of such programs indicate a net economic benefit. This evaluation focused on maximizing the use of actual data from the St. Louis region, such as Motorist Assist operator logs and customer surveys, average freeway volumes, and MoDOT accident records. Efficiency impacts were estimated based on a sample of about 5500 incidents extracted from the 2002 Motorist Assist operator logs. A comparison of incident duration was made between assistance by Motorist Assist and assistance without Motorist Assist. Most incidents were cleared in shorter time with Motorist Assist. Using computed values of freeway capacity and volume and percentages of reduced capacity due to the incident, the traffic delay savings attributed to Motorist Assist was estimated. The annual reduction in delay for 2002 was approximately 188, 677 vehicle-hours with a value of $ 2. 4 million. Additional efficiency benefits, not economically quantified, include savings to fuel consumption and police manpower, reduction in emissions, and providing traffic information to Gateway Guide, St Louis's intelligent transportation system. The evaluation of safety impacts focused on the analysis of accident records from 1987 through 1996 on two high-accident freeways. Two trends of annual <b>secondary</b> <b>accidents</b> were computed: one trend for the years before Motorist Assist debuted in 1993 and one trend for the years with Motorist Assist in service. Expanding the two trends to the year 2002, a total of 456 fewer <b>secondary</b> <b>accidents</b> occurred on the two freeways with Motorist Assist in service. The reduction in <b>secondary</b> <b>accidents</b> saved approximately $ 14 million.

40|$|<b>Secondary</b> <b>accident</b> {{statistics}} can {{be useful}} for studying the impact of traffic incident management strategies. An easy-to-implement methodology is presented for classifying secondary accidents using data fusion of a police accident database with intranet incident reports. A current method for classifying secondary accidents uses a static threshold that represents the spatial and temporal region of influence of the primary accident, such as two miles and one hour. An accident is considered secondary if it occurs upstream from the primary accident and is within the duration and queue of the primary accident. However, using the static threshold may result in both false positives and negatives because accident queues are constantly varying. The methodology presented in this report seeks to improve upon this existing method by making the threshold dynamic. An incident progression curve is used to {{mark the end of}} the queue throughout the entire incident. Four steps in the development of incident progression curves are described. Step one is the processing of intranet incident reports. Step two is the filling in of incomplete incident reports. Step three is the nonlinear regression of incident progression curves. Step four is the merging of individual incident progression curves into one master curve. To illustrate this methodology, 5, 514 accidents from Missouri freeways were analyzed.

40|$|The term {{domino effect}} denotes {{a chain of}} accidents, or situations, in which a fire/explosion load {{generated}} by an accident in one unit in an industry causes secondary and higher order accidents in other units. Such chains of accidents have a greater propensity to cause damage than stand-alone accidents. Most of the past risk assessment studies deal with accident in a single industry, more so {{in one of the}} units of an industry. But, often, accident in one unit causes a <b>secondary</b> <b>accident</b> in a nearby unit, which in turn may trigger a tertiary accident, and so on. The probability of occurrence and adverse impacts of such ‘domino ’ or ‘cascading ’ effects are increasing due to increasing congestion in industrial complexes and increasing density of human population around such complexes. Accidents with domino effect are seldom studied. LPG storage areas could produce the worst possible consequences {{in the event of an}} unforeseen incident. This work illustrates the application of models to evaluate the impacts of events with fire and explosion in LPG tanks on other similar units in the park and the possibility of occurrence of a domino effect. The criteria for occurrence of accidents with domino effect adopted in this work were 37. 5 kW/m 2 in case of fire radiation and an overpressure of 0. 7 atm in explosion cases in a receptor body.

40|$|Low-frequency {{electromagnetic}} fields, as {{they are}} emitted by facilities of electrical energy supply, can cause so-called non-adequate stimuli in the human organism, if they reach sufficient strength. These non-adequate stimuli can feign or mask adequate stimuli, which are caused by signals from the environment like sound, pressure, or light. Stronger electromagnetic fields can even provoke unpleasant or painful perceptions {{and can lead to}} life-threatening situations by irritating nerves and muscles. For this reason, the perception of weak low-frequency fields can be a warning signal. Besides, the sudden occurrence of such a low (actually harmless) perception can further lead to a so-called <b>secondary</b> <b>accident</b> due to a shock reaction and therefore has to be avoided. Therefore, the excitation thresholds of non-adequate stimuli are considered when safety regulations have to be established. However, the questions about mechanisms and places of action of the non-adequate stimulations still remained unanswered; the phenomenological descriptions were always based on external measures such as field strengths or amperages. In this work, the threshold is determined as the current density threshold at the point of origin of the non-adequate irritation. So, the threshold is no longer depending on external parameters like field configuration or individual anatomy. The current density threshold is not accessible by direct measurement, but must be investigated by combining measurements with volunteers and numerical calculations of the intracorporeal field distribution. The kinaesthetical channel (the sense of skin) and the visual channel (the sense of sight) are up to now referred to be the most sensitive sense channels regarding an excitability by low-frequency electromagnetic fields. Earlier estimations, which also form the basis of current discussions about a determination of base limits, resulted in very low values of about 2 mA/m². In this work, the mechanism and origin of non-adequate stimuli as well as the external threshold values are determined through examinations with volunteers. In combination with finite element calculations, the current density thresholds are evaluated. For this purpose, anatomically correct, electrical volume conductor models of the index finger have been developed for the kinaesthetical channel, and a worst case estimation is given, which also considers the grade of skin moisture. In the case of the visual channel, the eye, the periphery of the eye ball, and the head are replicated in a model, which represents structures down to sub-millimetre range. The new, calculated current density thresholds are up to two orders of magnitude higher than the estimated values known before: the sensitivity of the kinaesthetical and the visual channel regarding low-frequency electromagnetic fields were overestimated. As numerical calculations and experimental verifications show, field characteristics and individual anatomy of the body strongly influence the resulting current density distribution inside the body. Since receptors react only on the current density in their close vicinity, the current density thresholds {{in the area of the}} irritated receptors can be given independent from these factors...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis deals primarily with condition assessment of road equipment. The road equipment concept {{is defined by}} five main groups, road lighting, fences and barriers, vertical signs, horizontal signs and traffic signals, respectively. Of these groups, road markings, street lighting and barriers of three-lane roads have been studied more in detail. A state-of-the-art, comprising information obtained by comprehensive literature studies on condition assessment of road equipment is presented. Comparably few fundamental studies were found, which, to some degree, {{can be explained by}} the lack of suitable physical measurement methods. However, in the case of road marking retroreflectivity, mobile instruments have been developed, and research published in this area is relatively comprehensive. Furthermore, although not based on mobile measurements, several studies on assessments on performance of road sign sheeting have been published. The experimental part of the thesis is divided into four studies, of which two are dealing with mobile measurement of wet road markings and street lighting, respectively. One of the studies concerns condition assessment of road marking performance accomplished in the Nordic countries. Finally, one study comprises risk analysis related to crashes into the barriers on three-lane roads. At road equipment condition assessment, mobile measurement methods are preferable compared to stationary methods. However, many relevant parameters are tricky to measure at speed. One example in this connection is characterization of performance of wet road markings, which has to be based on one or more parameters obtained by measurements on dry surfaces. Results presented in this thesis indicate that retroreflectivity and skid resistance of wet road markings can be predicted based on retroreflectivity and macro-texture of dry road marking. For traffic safety, street lighting is important. The performance of this type of road equipment is in most cases described in terms of luminance of the illuminated road surface. However, luminance measurements are tricky and time-consuming and not useful for condition assessment. On the contrary, measurement of illuminance is easy to carry out and can be performed at speed. One part of the thesis describes how road surface luminance in street lighting can be estimated based on illuminance and reflection properties of the road surface. With the purpose of comparing road marking performance in the Nordic countries, condition assessment using mobile measurement equipment was accomplished in 2002 and 2003. In each of the five Nordic countries, a number of roads were chosen for measuring retroreflectivity. The study showed that the retroreflectivity of edge, centre and lane lines was poor in some countries, but, at least regarding edge lines, this shortcoming could be compensated by use of wide, continuous lines. In other words, the visibility of longitudinal road markings was approximately equal in the different countries. The purpose of the risk analysis performed on three-lane road barriers was to estimate the influence of the time-period between initial crash and repair on the risk of a <b>secondary</b> <b>accident.</b> The result showed that, especially in winter-time, time-reduction means reduced risk of secondary accidents.

In {{the last}} few decades, energy {{absorption}} of materials becomes an critical issue in a design process of a vehicle because risks of primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>accidents</b> against pedestrians, other road users and structures can be reduced by a performance of absorbing energy in its support structures.

One of the things that can cause disturbances in traffic flow and delays are traffic incidents. They cause non-recurrent congestions that cannot be predicted by time nor space.

For example, roadway incidents such as accidents, broken-down vehicles or other events that reduce the capacity of the facility impose a substantial cost to society when delays, congestion, secondary incidents, and environmental emissions are taken into consideration. These impacts can be substantially reduced through implementation of incident management programs. Significant benefits can be gained from early incident detection, quick response, provision of real-time traveller information and timely dispatch of emergence services. This can result in reducing traffic delays, <b>secondary</b> <b>accidents,</b> air pollution, and generally improve road safety and real-time traffic control.

The impacts of incident management programs on network performance can be evaluated either in field studies or using traffic simulation. Field studies are generally expensive to conduct and they don't offer flexibility in investigating alternative scenarios.

40|$|With {{perpetual}} strains on resources, road agencies need {{to develop}} network-level decision-making frameworks to ensure optimum resource allocation. This {{is especially true for}} incident management services and in particular variable message signs (VMS), which are relatively immature disciplines compared to traditional road engineering. The objective of incident management and VMS is to minimise the safety, efficiency, reliability and environmental impacts of incidents on the operations of the transport system. This may be achieved by informing travellers of the incidents so they can adapt their behaviour in a manner that reduces community impacts, such as lateness and the associated vehicle emissions, unreliability of travel times, as well as <b>secondary</b> <b>accidents</b> due to incidents. Generally, road authorities do carry out needs assessments, but qualitatively in many cases. Therefore, this masters research presents a framework that is systematic, quantitative and relatively easy to implement. In order to prioritise VMS infrastructure deployment, a risk management approach was taken that focuses on minimising the impacts on, and costs to the community. In the framework and case study conducted, safety, efficiency and reliability, and environmental impacts are quantified using an economic risk management approach to determine an overall risk score. This score can be used to rank road sections within the network, indicating the roads with the highest risk of incident network impacts and therefore the roads with the highest need for intervention. A cost-effectiveness based risk-reduction ranking can then be determined for each incident management treatment type, comparing the net risk with treatment to that without treatment, and dividing by the net present value of deployment. The two types of ranking, pure risk and cost-effectiveness based risk reduction, will help to minimise the network impacts on the community and optimise resource allocation...|$|R

Conclusion: The results confirmed that a jet fire may create a domino effect that could cause an accident aside from the <b>secondary</b> chemical <b>accident...</b>|$|R
40|$|The authors {{report a}} case of {{thrombophlebitis}} arising in an antecubital fossa vein resulting in a pulmonary embolism. Thrombophlebitis occurred in a vein with aneurysmal dilatation (27 mm dia) and was confirmed on duplex ultrasonography. A pulmonary embolism was suspected clinically and was confirmed by ventilation-perfusion scanning. The patient was managed by anticoagulation with warfarin. Two months later she developed features of a cerebro-vascular <b>accident</b> <b>secondary</b> to bleeding into cerebral hygromas following which anticoagulation was discontinued...|$|R
