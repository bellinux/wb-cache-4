50|$|The {{station is}} mostly clad in Finnish granite, and its {{distinguishing}} features are its clock tower {{and the two}} pairs of statues holding the <b>spherical</b> <b>lamps,</b> lit at night-time, {{on either side of}} the main entrance. Animated characters based on the statues have recently been featured in some major advertising campaigns by Finland's government-owned railway operator VR, to the extent of releasing rap singles allegedly sung by Kivimiehet ("The stone men").|$|R
40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{the composition of}} liquid radioactive wastes from the nuclear plants. Using traditional ways to extract organometallic compounds formed, when using the deactivation solutions to clean the surfaces of nuclear plant rooms, are complicated. The paper studies the edge-cutting methods of solving this problem. Its proposal {{is to use a}} combined ultraviolet treatment for organometallic compounds degradation based on ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) via pulsed xenon lamps. A potential use of the tubular and <b>spherical</b> geometry <b>lamps</b> is examined and advantages, disadvantages and features of these lamps are described. Instead of the pure EDTA the experiments used its disodium salt (Na 2 -EDTA). The hydrogen peroxide was used as an extra oxidizer. Absorption spectrums of solutions with various Na 2 -EDTA - hydrogen peroxide ratio were measured. It is found that the absorbance curve maximum is in the shortwave spectrum region (λ < 210 nm). The use of amalgam lamps of monochromatic radiation at wavelength λ = 254 nm will result only in formation of hydroxyl radicals but direct destruction processes of EDTA molecules due to radiation will be rare, and this decreases efficiency of their use. The spectral radiation characteristics of various continuum spectrum pulsed xenon lamps was measured. The experimental data expressed in relative units were compared with the emission spectrum of an absolutely black body. The paper shows that in <b>spherical</b> <b>lamps</b> high brightness temperature can be reached. Thus, in <b>spherical</b> <b>lamps</b> it is possible to obtain a spectrum, which is in maximum correlation with the absorption spectrum of the solutions under study, thereby making them a prospective radiation source for photo-degradation of EDTA compounds. For drawing a final conclusion it is necessary to conduct researches in order to compare Na 2 -EDTA degradation via tubular and <b>spherical</b> xenon <b>lamps.</b> </p...|$|R
50|$|Decoration of {{the station}} is {{centered}} on the 12 wall columns. Each of these feature a wooden bench surrounded by a black ironwork frame that supports four <b>spherical</b> <b>lamps</b> on the top, giving {{the impression of a}} traditional Moscow boulevard. However the central feature of this is an illuminated stained glass mosaic with an image of a historic Russian city (such as Rostov, Novgorod, Yaroslavl and others), all work of Zurab Tsereteli. The author is also responsible for two large mosaics which decorate the portals of the escalator tunnels upon leaving the station.|$|R
40|$|We {{advanced}} our {{simulation method}} for inductively-coupled plasma in a <b>spherical</b> electrodeless <b>lamp</b> and investigated improvement in lamp {{efficiency of the}} lamp. Resultantly, {{we found that the}} change of the lamp efficiency could be explained by focusing on the consumed power of plasma and the location of electrons with high energy. We also investigated the suitable lamp design to improve in the lamp efficiency. The possibility of improvement in the efficiency of 5. 4 lm/W was obtained by the optimization of the dimensions of the power coupler...|$|R
30|$|In this case, the {{photocatalytic}} {{activities of}} the CZTS hierarchical microstructures were evaluated by the degradation of RhB under visible-light irradiation. A <b>spherical</b> Xe <b>lamp</b> (500  W) with a cutoff filter (λ[*]>[*] 420  nm) {{was used as the}} visible-light source. In each turn, 20  mg photocatalyst (CZTS powders) was suspended in a 50  mL 0.05  mmol/L RhB aqueous solution, being used for the photocatalytic measurement. Then, this suspension was kept in the dark for 1  h under magnetic stirring to ensure an adsorption–desorption equilibrium between the dye and the catalysts. The relative concentration of RhB in the solution was detected using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 950 UV/Vis/NIR spectrometer), which is determined by the relative intensity of its absorption peak at 553  nm. The RhB degradation was calculated using the Lambert–Beer equation.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{a view of}} Broadway looking {{north from}} near Eighth Street in Los Angeles, ca. 1918. The wide paved street is at center and is marked by two sets of {{streetcar}} tracks. Three streetcars are visible in the distance at center, {{one on the left}} track and two on the right. There are broad cement sidewalks running along both sides of the street and the sidewalk at left is crowded with pedestrians. Broadway is lined with buildings, including several very tall department stores. A line of <b>spherical</b> street <b>lamps</b> is along {{the left side of the}} road. Legible signs include, from left to right, "Stationery", "Bullock's", Walter P. Sto[?] Building", "Lyon McKinney Smith Co. Furniture", "Van Sant Piano Co. ", "Stoves Water He[aters]", "Office and Bank Fur[niture]", "Shades Wall Paper Interior", "Furniture Barker Bros. Inc. ", and "Carpets, Oriental & Domestic Rugs"...|$|R
2500|$|At {{most of the}} system's entrances and exits, {{there is}} a lamppost or two bearing a colored <b>spherical</b> or cube-shaped <b>lamp.</b> These lights roughly {{indicate}} the station's availability (i.e. how often it is accessible): green means a full-time entrance and booth, red means either a part-time booth or no booth, hence either exit-only or entrance with MetroCard. Older lamps are completely colored green or red, while newer ones, called [...] "half-moons", have only the top half colored, while the bottom half is milky white; this is to provide more light, and the half-colored globes have the same meanings as the globes with full colors. There are also some square lamps.|$|R
