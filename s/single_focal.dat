50|$|These eyepieces {{work well}} with the very long focal length telescopes (in Huygens day they were used with <b>single</b> element long <b>focal</b> length non-achromatic refracting telescopes, {{including}} very long focal length aerial telescopes). This optical design is now considered obsolete since with today's shorter focal length telescopes the eyepiece suffers from short eye relief, high image distortion, chromatic aberration, and a very narrow apparent field of view. Since these eyepieces are cheap to make they can often be found on inexpensive telescopes and microscopes.|$|R

40|$|The {{fabrication}} and optimization of InAs/GaSb type-II superlattice (SL) detectors for single-color and dual-color {{focal plane}} arrays in the mid-wavelength infrared spectral range between 3 - 5 &mgr;m is reported. <b>Single</b> color <b>focal</b> plane arrays with 288 x 384 detector elements and 24 &mgr;m pitch have been fabricated with high pixel yield.

A dual-color MWIR/MWIR InAs/GaSb SL camera, developed for missile approach warning systems, features simultaneous and spatially coincident detection for both spectral channels on each pixel.

50|$|In {{a perfect}} lens or {{parabolic}} reflector, rays {{parallel to the}} device's axis striking the lens or reflector all pass through a <b>single</b> point, the <b>focal</b> point. In an imperfectly constructed lens or reflector, rays passing through {{different parts of the}} element do not converge to a single point but have different focal points. The set of these focal points forms a region called the focal cloud. The diameter of the focal cloud determines the maximum resolution of the optical system. Lens-reflector artifacts, geometry and other imperfections determine the actual diameter of the focal cloud.|$|R
40|$|The ART-XC {{instrument}} is an X-ray grazing-incidence telescope system in an ABRIXAS-type optical configuration optimized for the survey observational mode of the Spectrum-RG astrophysical mission {{which is scheduled}} to be launched in 2011. ART-XC has two units, each equipped with four identical X-ray multi-shell mirror modules. The optical axes of the individual mirror modules are not parallel but are separated by several degrees to permit the four modules to share a <b>single</b> CCD <b>focal</b> plane detector, 1 / 4 of the area each. The 450 -micron-thick pnCCD (similar to the adjacent eROSITA telescope detector) will allow detection of X-ray photons up to 15 keV. The field of view of the individual mirror module is about 18 x 18 arcminutes(exp 2) and the sensitivity of the ART-XC system for 4 years of survey will be better than 10 (exp - 12) erg s(exp - 1) cm(exp - 2) over the 4 - 12 keV energy band. This will allow the ART-XC instrument to discover several thousand new AGNs...|$|R

CT assists in defining the anatomic relationship between the mass and its parent bone and helps when evaluating {{the condition of the}} articular cartilage and soft tissues [3].
