40|$|Flying insects execute aerial {{maneuvers}} through subtle {{manipulations of}} their wing motions. Here, we measure the free flight kinematics of fruit flies and determine how they modulate their wing pitching to induce sharp turns. By analyzing the torques these insects exert to pitch their wings, we infer that the wing hinge {{acts as a}} torsional spring that passively resists the wing's tendency to flip in response to aerodynamic and inertial forces. To turn, the insects asymmetrically change the <b>spring</b> <b>rest</b> angles to generate rowing motions of their wings. Thus, insects can generate these maneuvers using only a slight active actuation that biases their wing motion. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figures, submitted to PR...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Control of insect-scale flapping-wing robots is {{challenging}} due to weight constraints and inherent instabilities. Instead of adding more actuators {{to increase the}} controllability of the flapping-wing robot, we use a single actuator to drive a system of mechanical linkages to cause bilaterally asymmetric changes in the wing hinge <b>spring</b> <b>rest</b> angle of {{the left and right}} wings. We show in simulation that such a control input can generate wing motions which produce yaw and roll torques. A kinematic model of the mechanism was developed and an atscale prototype of this concept was built. High speed videos of its wing motions are consistent with the kinematic model and according to the simulation, are capable of generating adequate yaw and roll torques for attitude control. I...|$|E

40|$|Advances in legged {{robotics}} {{have led}} to the development of robots capable of running over rough terrain. Edubot, one such hexapedal robot, is a biologically inspired runner that mimics the cockroach in its alternating tripod gait and compliant legs. Most animals’ running gaits can be approximated by the Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP) model, which treats an animal as a point mass on a linear spring. The SLIP model has been demonstrated to accurately model the center of mass motion of running animals, as well as the ground reaction forces associated with their gaits. While Edubot’s running behavior can also be viewed in terms of the SLIP model, the linear spring in the model fails to capture the complexity of the compliant C-shaped legs of the robot. These legs have shown superior performance over all previous designs. In this paper we attempt to isolate the characteristics of the C-legs and study their individual and combined effect on performance in hopes of understanding how to design better legs. We do this by decoupling and mathematically modeling the <b>spring</b> <b>rest</b> length and the effective stiffness of the leg as it rolls through stance. Using a SLIP model modified with our equations, w...|$|E
40|$|Cellzilla is a {{two-dimensional}} tissue simulation platform for plant modeling utilizing Cellerator arrows. Cellerator describes biochemical interactions with a simplified arrow-based notation; all interactions are input as reactions and are automatically translated {{to the appropriate}} differential equations using a computer algebra system. Cells are represented by a polygonal mesh of well-mixed compartments. Cell constituents can interact intercellularly via Cellerator reactions utilizing diffusion, transport, and action at a distance, as well as amongst themselves within a cell. The mesh data structure consists of vertices, edges (vertex pairs), and cells (and optional intercellular wall compartments) as ordered collections of edges. Simulations may be either static, in which cell constituents change with time but cell size and shape remain fixed; or dynamic, where cells can also grow. Growth is controlled by Hookean springs associated with each mesh edge and an outward pointing pressure force. <b>Spring</b> <b>rest</b> length grows at a rate proportional to the extension beyond equilibrium. Cell division occurs when a specified constituent (or cell mass) passes a (random, normally distributed) threshold. The orientation of new cell walls is determined either by Errera's rule, or by a potential model that weighs contributions due to equalizing daughter areas, minimizing wall length, alignment perpendicular to cell extension, and alignment perpendicular to actual growth direction...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to obtain and {{evaluate}} information from behavioural monitoring of beef cattle herd (cows, bull, calves) reared in the suckler system in the year-round grazing. The beef herd situated in the Pilsen region near Přeštice and is owned by private breeder was chosen for observation. Basic herd consisted of 20 cows with calves and one Charolais sire. There were three ethological observations, two observations in 2014 and one observation in 2015, duration of observations was 24 hours. The course of each category of behaviour was recorded by interval group method with interval length of 5 minutes. Activities as feed intake, rest, standing and movement. It was also reported comfort, sexual and maternal behaviour within the herd. The longest period of cows feed intake was recorded {{at the end of}} the grazing season (30. 56 % of the day, i. e. 7. 33 hours). In contrast, feed intake took cattle in the winter months only 28. 31 % of the day (6. 8 hours). Values in the standing category were not substantially different during the year. The longest standing time in the spring and autumn (5. 97 hours respectively. 5. 95 hours), standing time in the winter was shortened to 5. 56 hours. Locomotion activity of animals in the spring reached 7. 78 %, i. e. 1. 87 hour and due to the fact that cattle was still fed hay, but also first low vegetation started to grow in some areas and animals on its wintering actively sought it. In contrast, in the autumn the value was only 2. 43 %, i. e. 0. 58 hours of the day due to sufficient suitable pasture. In the winter due to bad weather conditions, the value also decreased to 7. 8 %, i. e. 1. 88 hours of the day. The longest representation of rest category in form of laying was recorded in the herd in autumn at level of 10. 13 hours of the day (i. e. 40. 22 % of the day). In the <b>spring</b> <b>rest</b> category took 9. 00 hours (i. e. 37. 48 %). The form of animal husbandry at the farm was in correspondence with the natural biorhythms of the animals and allowed them to freely demonstrate natural instincts and behaviour. Based on the findings it is possible to judge that the system of suckler beef herds is useful in terms of ensuring animal welfare and Charolais breed is exercisable under those conditions...|$|E
