The technical core in our proposal is a special type of circulant matrix, for which we prove the linear independence of matrix vectors, present efficient algorithms on matrix operations, and describe a secure encryption against ciphertext-only attack. By combining all of those with LPN and related to the multivariate quadratic problem, the LCMQ protocol not only is provably secure against all probabilistic polynomial-time adversaries, but also outperforms all HB-like protocols, in terms of tag’s computation overhead, <b>storage</b> <b>expense,</b> and communication cost...|$|R

The reasons for the popularity of such alternatives include presumed cost effectiveness, retention of scarce power plant sites, and the continued ability to pass on waste <b>storage</b> <b>expenses</b> as a cost of service. In this chapter, James Hewlett addresses nuclear power plant life extension- -which he calls NUPLEX [...] in its economic garb, starting {{with a look at}} the common utility presumption that life extension of a nuclear plant will allow it to produce electricity at a lower rate than new coal generation. This presumption, he argues, may not be supportable by analysis. He concludes that the deferral of constructing new replacement capacity would result in cost savings only if both the level and escalation rate of the operating costs for the refurbished unit fall substantially from 1986 levels. Therefore, it is unclear whether the deferral of the construction of new capacity would result in the cost savings, although it definitely shifts the financial burden into the future. ...|$|E

These include efficient elasticity mechanisms resulting in higher resource utilization and lower operational costs. VM as software artifacts are created using provider-specific templates, called VM images (VMI), and are stored in proprietary or public repositories for further use. However, some technology specific choices can limit the interoperability among various Cloud providers and bundle the VMIs with nonessential or redundant software packages, leading to increased storage size, prolonged VMI delivery, stagnant VMI instantiation and ultimately vendor lock-in. To address these challenges, we present a set of novel functionalities and design approaches for efficient operation of distributed VMI repositories, specifically tailored for enabling: (i) simplified creation of lightweight and size optimized VMIs tuned for specific application requirements; (ii) multi-objective VMI repository optimization; and (iii) efficient reasoning mechanism to help optimizing complex VMI operations.

40|$|As one of {{the most}} {{effective}} sequential optimization tech-niques, retiming is a structural transformation that relocates flip-flops in a circuit without changing its functionality. The min-area retiming problem seeks a solution with the mini-mum flip-flop area (or number) under a given clock period. Even though having polynomial runtime, the best existing algorithms for this problem still need to first construct a dense path graph and then find a min-cost network flow on it, thus incur huge <b>storage</b> and time <b>expenses</b> for large cir-cuits. Recently, provable incremental algorithms have been discovered for min-period retiming, and heuristic incremen-tal algorithms have been proposed for min-area retiming.

In this paper, we fill the gap by presenting an efficient algorithm to solve the min-area retiming problem incremen-tally and optimally.

One of the most efficient ways to obtain these results is to reduce the costs of any kind.

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this study is}} to {{optimize}} the energy cost of a nearly Zero Energy Building (nZEB) integrated with Electric Vehicle (EV). nZEB is a residential building which is able to produce the same energy on site as it consumes. nZEB simulated in this work is based on a Finnish townhouse and considered to be located in Helsinki. Two different systems are considered in the nZEB. The first system consists of photovoltaic (PV) with four installation strategies, EV, household loads and the utility grid. While PV acts like the main energy source, household loads and EV are regarded as loads in the system. nZEB is connected to the electricity grid to be able to purchase electricity when the amount of produced energy is not adequate for energy demand and to export the on-site generated electricity when the produced energy surpluses the energy demand as well. In the second system a 10 kWh battery is included to this system as the storage element. In these systems, initially the power demand profile of EVs needs to be determined. Since charging behaviors of EV users depend heavily on driving habits such as arrival time, departure time and daily travelled distance, Finnish National Travel Survey results are employed to get accurate data on driving behaviors of Finns. Power demand profiles of EVs are obtained for weekdays and weekends of four seasons. After that, optimization process is performed to minimize the daily cost of nZEB. Cost values of the system when there is no EV in the house, when EV is added and when both EV and PV strategies are involved are presented and compared. Results show that cost values decrease significantly with the addition of PV to the system. In spring and summer seasons, negative cost numbers are obtained which means profit for the customers.

40|$|Trajectory {{simplification}} is {{a problem}} encountered in areas like Robot programming by demonstration, CAD/CAM, computer vision, and in GPS-based applications like traffic analysis. This problem entails reduction of the points in a given trajectory while keeping the relevant points which preserve important information. The benefits include <b>storage</b> reduction, computational <b>expense,</b> while making data more manageable. Common techniques formulate a minimization problem to be solved, where the solution is found iteratively under some error metric, which causes the algorithms to work in super-linear time. We present an algorithm called FastSTray, which selects the relevant points in the trajectory in linear time by following an open loop heuristic approach. While most current trajectory simplification algorithms are tailored for GPS trajectories, our approach focuses on smooth trajectories for robot programming by demonstration recorded using motion capture systems. Two variations of the algorithm are presented: 1. aims to preserve shape and temporal information; 2. preserves only shape information. Using the points in the simplified trajectory we use cubic splines to interpolate between these points and recreate the original trajectory. The presented algorithm was tested on trajectories recorded from a hand-tracking system. It was able to eliminate about 90 % of the points in the original trajectories while maintaining errors between 0. 78 - 2 cm which corresponds to 1 %- 2. 4 % relative error {{with respect to the}} bounding box of the trajectories...|$|R
40|$|Members of {{the short}} neuropeptide F (sNPF) family of {{peptides}} and their cognate receptors play key roles {{in a variety of}} physiological processes in arthropods. In silico screening of GigasDatabase, a specific expressed sequence tag database from the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, resulted in the identification of a receptor (Cg -sNPFR-like) phylogenetically closely related to sNPF receptors (sNPFRs) of insects. A reverse endocrinology approach was undertaken to identify the peptide ligand(s) of this orphan receptor. Though structurally distinct from insect sNPFs, three RFamide peptides derived from the same precursor, i. e. GSLFRFamide, SSLFRFamide and GALFRFamide, specifically activate the receptor in a dose-dependent manner, with respective EC 50 values (half-maximal effective concentrations) of 1. 1, 2. 1 and 4. 1 µmol l - 1. We found that both Cg -sNPFR-like receptor and LFRFamide encoding transcripts are expressed in the oyster central nervous system and in other tissues as well, albeit at lower levels. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed the wide distribution of LFRFamide mature peptides in several central and peripheral tissues. The Cg -sNPFR-like receptor was more abundantly expressed in ganglia of females than of males, and upregulated in starved oysters. In the gonad area, highest receptor gene expression occurred at the start of gametogenesis, when storage activity is maximal. Our results suggest that signaling of LFRFamide peptides through the Cg -sNPFR-like receptor might {{play a role in the}} coordination of nutrition, energy storage and metabolism in C. gigas, possibly by promoting <b>storage</b> at the <b>expense</b> of reproduction...|$|R
40|$|Content based video {{retrieval}} (CBVR) {{has been}} strongly {{motivated by a}} variety of realworld applications. Most state-of-the-art CBVR systems are built based on Bag-of-visual- Words (BovW) framework for visual resources representation and access. The framework, however, ignores spatial and temporal information contained in videos, which plays a fundamental role in unveiling semantic meanings. The information includes not only the spatial layout of visual content on a still frame (image), but also temporal changes across the sequential frames. Specially, spatially and temporally co-occurring visual words, which are extracted under the BovW framework, often tend to collaboratively represent objects, scenes, or events in the videos. The spatial and temporal information discovery would be useful to advance the CBVR technology. In this thesis, we propose to explore and analyse the spatial and temporal information from a new perspective: i) co-occurrence of the visual words is formulated as a correlation matrix, ii) spatial proximity and temporal coherence are analytically and empirically studied to re ne this correlation. Following this, a quantitative spatial and temporal correlation (STC) model is de ned. The STC discovered from either the query example (denoted by QC) or the data collection (denoted by DC) are assumed to determine speci- city of the visual words in the retrieval model, i:e: selected Words-Of-Interest are found more important for certain topics. Based on this hypothesis, we utilized the STC matrix to establish a novel visual content similarity measurement method and a query reformulation scheme for the retrieval model. Additionally, the STC also characterizes the context of the visual words, and accordingly a STC-Based context similarity measurement is proposed to detect the synonymous visual words. The method partially solves an inherent error of visual vocabulary under the BovW framework. Systematic experimental evaluations on public TRECVID and CC WEB VIDEO video collections demonstrate that the proposed methods based on the STC can substantially improve retrieval e ectiveness of the BovW framework. The retrieval model based on STC outperforms state-of-the-art CBVR methods on the data collections without <b>storage</b> and computational <b>expense.</b> Furthermore, the rebuilt visual vocabulary in this thesis is more compact and e ective. Above methods can be incorporated together for e ective and e cient CBVR system implementation. Based on the experimental results, it is concluded that the spatial-temporal correlation e ectively approximates the semantical correlation. This discovered correlation approximation can be utilized for both visual content representation and similarity measurement, which are key issues for CBVR technology development...|$|R
