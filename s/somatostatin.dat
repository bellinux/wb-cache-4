5|$|TRH is {{secreted}} at {{an increased}} rate in situations such as cold exposure {{in order to}} stimulate thermogenesis. In addition to being suppressed {{by the presence of}} thyroid hormones, TSH production is blunted by dopamine, <b>somatostatin,</b> and glucocorticoids.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from stable}} lutetium, its {{radioactive}} isotopes have several specific uses. The suitable half-life and decay mode made lutetium-176 {{used as a}} pure beta emitter, using lutetium which has been exposed to neutron activation, and in lutetium–hafnium dating to date meteorites. The synthetic isotope lutetium-177 bound to octreotate (a <b>somatostatin</b> analogue), is used experimentally in targeted radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumors. Indeed, lutetium-177 is seeing increasing use as a radionuclide, in neuroendrocine tumor therapy and bone pain palliation.|$|E
5|$|For {{functioning}} tumors, the <b>somatostatin</b> analog {{class of}} medications, such as octreotide, {{can reduce the}} excessive production of hormones. Lanreotide can slow tumor growth. If the tumor is not amenable to surgical removal and is causing symptoms, targeted therapy with everolimus or sunitinib can reduce symptoms and slow progression of the disease. Standard cytotoxic chemotherapy is generally not very effective for PanNETs, but may be used when other drug treatments fail to prevent the disease from progressing, or in poorly differentiated PanNET cancers.|$|E
5|$|Gallium-68, a {{positron}} emitter with a half-life of 68 min, is {{now used}} as a diagnostic radionuclide in PET-CT when linked to pharmaceutical preparations such as DOTATOC, a <b>somatostatin</b> analogue used for neuroendocrine tumors investigation, and DOTA-TATE, a newer one, used for neuroendocrine metastasis and lung neuroendocrine cancer, such as certain types of microcytoma. Gallium-68's preparation as a pharmaceutical is chemical and the radionuclide is extracted by elution from germanium-68, a synthetic radioisotope of germanium, in gallium-68 generators.|$|E
25|$|The sex-specific {{transcription}} of <b>somatostatin</b> gene {{coincides with}} the establishment of sex differences in SDN-POA. It is observed that <b>somatostatin</b> mRNA appears in the SDN-POA of both males and females. On postnatal day 8 through postnatal day 35, the area of <b>somatostatin</b> mRNA-positive cells was significantly larger in males than in females, with males attain the maximum size of that area on day15 before decrease whereas females show no changes. Eventually the expression of <b>somatostatin</b> mRNA shows no difference between sexes. It is possible that <b>somatostatin</b> is related to the estrogen-dependent organization of SDN-POA.|$|E
25|$|Surgical removal is {{the usual}} {{treatment}} for GH-producing tumors. In some circumstances, focused radiation or a GH antagonist such as pegvisomant may be employed to shrink the tumor or block function. Other drugs like octreotide (<b>somatostatin</b> agonist) and bromocriptine (dopamine agonist) {{can be used to}} block GH secretion because both <b>somatostatin</b> and dopamine negatively inhibit GHRH-mediated GH release from the anterior pituitary.|$|E
25|$|These cells {{release the}} {{peptides}} Growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH or somatocrinin) and Growth hormone-inhibiting hormone (GHIH or <b>somatostatin)</b> into the hypophyseal portal venous blood surrounding the pituitary.|$|E
25|$|Ghrelin {{inhibits}} glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from beta {{cells in}} the pancreatic islets. Ghrelin does this indirectly by promoting local negative feedback mediated by <b>somatostatin</b> from pancreatic delta cells, which selectively express the ghrelin receptor.|$|E
25|$|Opioid receptors are a {{group of}} G protein-coupled receptors with opioids as ligands. The {{endogenous}} opioids are dynorphins, enkephalins, endorphins, endomorphins, and nociceptin. The opioid receptors are ~40% identical to <b>somatostatin</b> receptors (SSTRs). Opiate receptors were discovered in 1972 by the American neuroscientist and pharmacologist named Candace Pert.|$|E
25|$|Neprilysin-deficient {{knockout}} mice show both Alzheimer's-like behavioral {{impairment and}} amyloid-beta deposition in the brain, providing strong {{evidence for the}} protein's association with the Alzheimer's disease process. Because neprilysin {{is thought to be}} the rate-limiting step in amyloid beta degradation, it has been considered a potential therapeutic target; compounds such as the peptide hormone <b>somatostatin</b> have been identified that increase the enzyme's activity level. One hypothesis for the strong dependence of Alzheimer's incidence on age focuses on the declining production of <b>somatostatin</b> in the brains of elderly people, which thus depresses the activity of neprilysin and promotes aggregation of unprocessed amyloid beta. Declining neprilysin activity with increasing age may also be explained by oxidative damage, known to be a causative factor in Alzheimer's disease; higher levels of inappropriately oxidized neprilysin have been found in Alzheimer's patients compared to cognitively normal elderly people.|$|E
25|$|At initial diagnosis, {{hypoglycemia}} is corrected with intravenous glucose {{to normalize}} plasma glucose concentration and prevent brain damage. Long-term medical management includes {{the use of}} diazoxide, <b>somatostatin</b> analogs, nifedipine, glucagon, recombinant IGF-I, glucocorticoids, human growth hormone, dietary intervention, or combinations of these therapies. In individuals in whom aggressive medical management fails to maintain plasma glucose concentration within safe limits, or in whom such therapy cannot be safely maintained over time, pancreatic resection is considered.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 3 million cell {{clusters}} called pancreatic islets {{are present}} in the pancreas. Within these islets are four main types of cells which are involved in the regulation of blood glucose levels. Each type of cell secretes a different type of hormone: α alpha cells secrete glucagon (increase glucose in blood), β beta cells secrete insulin (decrease glucose in blood), δ delta cells secrete <b>somatostatin</b> (regulates/stops α and β cells) and PP cells, or γ (gamma) cells, secrete pancreatic polypeptide. These act to control blood glucose through secreting glucagon to increase the levels of glucose, and insulin to decrease it.|$|E
25|$|About 20,000 protein coding {{genes are}} {{expressed}} in human cells and about 50% of these genes {{are expressed in}} the normal pancreas. Less than 100 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the pancreas. Similar to the salivary glands, most of the pancreas specific genes encode for secreted proteins. Corresponding pancreas specific proteins are either expressed in the exocrine cellular compartment and have functions related to digestion of food uptake such as digestive chymotrypsinogen enzymes and pancreatic lipase PNLIP, or expressed in the various cells of the endocrine pancreatic islets and have functions related to secreted hormones such as insulin, glucagon, <b>somatostatin</b> and pancreatic polypeptide.|$|E
25|$|The multi-potent {{pancreatic}} progenitor {{cells have}} the capacity to differentiate into any of the pancreatic cells: acinar cells, endocrine cells, and ductal cells. These progenitor cells are characterised by the co-expression of the transcription factors PDX1 and NKX6-1. Under the influence of neurogenin-3 and ISL1, but in the absence of notch receptor signaling, these cells differentiate to form two lines of committed endocrine precursor cells. The first line, under the direction of a Pax gene, forms α- and γ- cells, which produce glucagon and pancreatic polypeptides, respectively. The second line, influenced by Pax-6, produces beta cells (β-) and delta cells (δ-), which secrete insulin and <b>somatostatin,</b> respectively.|$|E
25|$|Endocrine {{insufficiency}} of {{the pancreas}} occurs with JBS, {{though it is}} sometimes less common and less pronounced than the more prominent effects on exocrine function. The islets of Langerhans are ducts in the pancreas where endocrine activity such as the release of hormones glucagon, <b>somatostatin</b> and insulin takes place. Pancreatic endocrine insufficiency in JBS {{can be associated with}} either a buildup of connective tissue in the islet regions, congenital replacement of the islets with fatty tissue, or improper nerve signalling to the islets. Endocrine dysfunction of the pancreas often results in diabetes mellitus. Both insulin resistance and diabetes have been observed with JBS, and it is suggested that diabetes should be considered as a complication of JBS and its course.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{evidence}} from people with {{other health problems}} crystalloid and colloids {{are believed to be}} equivalent for peptic ulcer bleeding. Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) may reduce mortality in those with severe disease as well as the risk of re-bleeding and the need for surgery among this group. Oral and intravenous formulations may be equivalent; however, the evidence to support this is suboptimal. In those with less severe disease and where endoscopy is rapidly available, they are of less immediate clinical importance. There is tentative evidence of benefit for tranexamic acid which inhibits clot breakdown. <b>Somatostatin</b> and octreotide, while recommended for varicial bleeding, have not been found to be of general use for non variceal bleeds. After treatment of a high risk bleeding ulcer endoscopically giving a PPI once or a day rather than as an infusion appears to work just as well and is less expensive (the method may be either by mouth or intravenously).|$|E
25|$|Acromegaly (also {{known as}} hypersomatotropism) is a {{hormonal}} condition resulting from over-secretion {{of the growth}} hormone somatotropin from the pituitary gland. The hormone is responsible for growth from birth to adulthood. Normally in adulthood, the growth plates of the bones close and the secretion of the hormone slows considerably. Because the bone plates close when entering maturity, the continued growth of acromegaly is not of normal proportions. Most dogs with the disease are unspayed females, but the condition can come about with use of medications containing progesterone. Acromegaly patients often also have diabetes mellitus. There is a transient form of acromegaly which can affect females at the diestrus portion of the reproductive cycle. This condition is {{brought about by the}} mammary glands excreting excess growth hormone, which is triggered by progesterone from the ovaries. As with non-transient acromegaly, spaying is necessary. The symptoms can include overgrowth or enlargement of gums with wide spaces between teeth, increased drinking, increased urination, thickening of the skin and skin folds, enlargement of the tongue and excessive panting. Acromegaly is also possible from a somatotroph adenoma. The hormone <b>somatostatin</b> can also be useful in treatment. Since hypothyroidism is connected with the release of excess growth hormone, hypothyroidism can be mistaken for acromegaly.|$|E
500|$|Midodrine is an alpha-agonist and {{octreotide}} is an analogue of <b>somatostatin,</b> {{a hormone}} involved in regulation of blood vessel tone in the gastrointestinal tract. [...] The medications are respectively systemic vasoconstrictors and inhibitors of splanchnic vasodilation, {{and were not}} found to be useful when used individually in treatment of hepatorenal syndrome. [...] However, one study of 13 patients with hepatorenal syndrome showed significant improvement in kidney function when the two were used together (with midodrine given orally, octreotide given subcutaneously and both dosed according to blood pressure), with three patients surviving to discharge. Another nonrandomized, observational study of individuals with HRS treated with subcutaneous octreotide and oral midodrine showed that there was increased survival at 30 days.|$|E
2500|$|The pylorus also {{contains}} scattered parietal cells and neuroendocrine cells.

2500|$|The {{basal ganglia}} {{contains}} many afferent glutamatergic inputs, with predominantly GABAergic efferent fibers, modulatory cholinergic pathways, significant dopamine in the pathways {{originating in the}} ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra, as well as various neuropeptides. [...] Neuropeptides found in the basal ganglia include substance P, neurokinin A, cholecystokinin, neurotensin, neurokinin B, neuropeptide Y, <b>somatostatin,</b> dynorphin, enkephaline. [...] Other neuromodulators found in the basal ganglia include nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, and phenylethylamine.|$|E
2500|$|Based on {{evidence}} from people with {{other health problems}} crystalloid and colloids {{are believed to be}} equivalent for peptic ulcer bleeding. In people with a confirmed peptic ulcer, there is conflicting evidence if proton pump inhibitors reduce death rates, but PPIs do reduce the risk of re-bleeding and the need for surgery among this group. In those with less severe disease and where endoscopy is rapidly available, they are of less immediate clinical importance. [...] Tranexamic acid might be effective to reduce mortality, but the evidence for this is weak. But the evidence is promising. <b>Somatostatin</b> and octreotide while recommended for varicial bleeding have not been found to be of general use for non varicial bleeds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pancreas}} [...] is a glandular organ in {{the digestive}} system and endocrine system of vertebrates. In humans, {{it is located}} in the abdominal cavity behind the stomach. [...] It is an endocrine gland producing several important hormones, including insulin, glucagon, <b>somatostatin,</b> and pancreatic polypeptide, all of which circulate in the blood. The pancreas is also a digestive organ, secreting pancreatic juice containing bicarbonate to neutralize acidity of chyme moving in from the stomach, as well as digestive enzymes that assist digestion and absorption of nutrients in the small intestine. These enzymes help to further break down the carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids in the chyme. The pancreas is known as a mixed gland.|$|E
2500|$|Astrocytes detect {{neuronal}} {{activity and}} can release chemical transmitters, {{which in turn}} control synaptic activity. In the past, hyperalgesia {{was thought to be}} modulated by the release of substance P and excitatory amino acids (EAA), such as glutamate, from the presynaptic afferent nerve terminals in the spinal cord dorsal horn. Subsequent activation of AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid), NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) and kainate subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptors follows. It is the activation of these receptors that potentiates the pain signal up the spinal cord. This idea, although true, is an oversimplification of pain transduction. [...] A litany of other neurotransmitter and neuromodulators, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), <b>somatostatin,</b> vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), galanin, and vasopressin are all synthesized and released in response to noxious stimuli. In addition to each of these regulatory factors, several other interactions between pain-transmitting neurons and other neurons in the dorsal horn have added impact on pain pathways.|$|E
2500|$|Different {{phases of}} {{digestion}} take place including: the cephalic phase, gastric phase, and intestinal phase. The cephalic phase {{occurs at the}} sight, thought and smell of food, which stimulate the cerebral cortex. Taste and smell stimuli are sent to the hypothalamus and medulla oblongata. After this it is routed through the vagus nerve and release of acetylcholine. Gastric secretion at this phase rises to 40% of maximum rate. Acidity in the stomach is not buffered by food {{at this point and}} thus acts to inhibit parietal (secretes acid) and G cell (secretes gastrin) activity via D cell secretion of <b>somatostatin.</b> The gastric phase takes 3 to 4 hours. It is stimulated by distension of the stomach, presence of food in stomach and decrease in pH. Distention activates long and myenteric reflexes. This activates the release of acetylcholine, which stimulates the release of more gastric juices. As protein enters the stomach, it binds to hydrogen ions, which raises the pH of the stomach. Inhibition of gastrin and gastric acid secretion is lifted. This triggers G cells to release gastrin, which in turn stimulates parietal cells to secrete gastric acid. [...] Gastric acid is about 0.5% hydrochloric acid (HCl), which lowers the pH to the desired pH of 1-3. [...] Acid release is also triggered by acetylcholine and histamine.|$|E
50|$|Among the vertebrates, {{there exist}} six {{different}} <b>somatostatin</b> genes {{that have been}} named SS1, SS2, SS3, SS4, SS5, and SS6. Zebrafish have all 6. The six different genes along with the five different <b>somatostatin</b> receptors allows <b>somatostatin</b> to possess a large range of functions. Humans have only one <b>somatostatin</b> gene, SST.|$|E
50|$|<b>Somatostatin</b> is {{produced}} by neuroendocrine neurons of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus. These neurons project to the median eminence, where <b>somatostatin</b> is released from neurosecretory nerve endings into the hypothalamo-hypophysial system through neuron axons. <b>Somatostatin</b> is then carried to the anterior pituitary gland, where it inhibits the secretion of growth hormone from somatotrope cells. The <b>somatostatin</b> neurons in the periventricular nucleus mediate negative feedback effects of growth hormone on its own release; the <b>somatostatin</b> neurons respond to high circulating concentrations of growth hormone and somatomedins by increasing the release of <b>somatostatin,</b> so reducing the rate of secretion of growth hormone.|$|E
50|$|The {{actions of}} GHRH are opposed by <b>somatostatin</b> (growth-hormone-inhibiting hormone). <b>Somatostatin</b> is {{released}} from neurosecretory nerve terminals of periventricular <b>somatostatin</b> neurons, and is {{carried by the}} hypothalamo-hypophysial portal circulation to the anterior pituitary where it inhibits GH secretion. <b>Somatostatin</b> and GHRH are secreted in alternation, giving rise to the markedly pulsatile secretion of GH.|$|E
50|$|Cortistatin is a neuropeptide {{with strong}} {{structural}} similarity to <b>somatostatin</b> (both peptides {{belong to the}} same family). It binds to all known <b>somatostatin</b> receptors, and shares many pharmacological and functional properties with <b>somatostatin,</b> including the depression of neuronal activity. However, it also has many properties distinct from <b>somatostatin,</b> such as induction of slow-wave sleep, apparently by antagonism of the excitatory effects of acetylcholine on the cortex, reduction of locomotor activity, and activation of cation selective currents not responsive to <b>somatostatin.</b>|$|E

50|$|D {{cells in}} the stomach contain CCKBR (which respond to gastrin) and M3 receptors (which respond to Ach). Respectively, these receptors will {{increase}} <b>somatostatin</b> output and decrease <b>somatostatin</b> output from the D cells. VIP, vasoactive intestinal peptide, acts positively on D cells resulting in more <b>somatostatin</b> being released.|$|E
50|$|Low intragastric pH stimulates antral D {{cells to}} release <b>somatostatin.</b> <b>Somatostatin</b> {{inhibits}} gastrin release from G cells. Reduced gastrin secretion reduces acid secretion.|$|E
50|$|<b>Somatostatin</b> is also {{produced}} by several other populations that project centrally, i.e., {{to other areas}} of the brain, and <b>somatostatin</b> receptors are expressed at many different sites in the brain.
