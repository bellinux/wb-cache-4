40|$|Most {{studies have}} {{measured}} {{the benefits of}} rehabilitated rural roads by focusing on reductions in monetary or time costs needed to access product and factor markets or key public social services. This paper complements these studies by evaluating their impact on key welfare indicators such as income or consumption. Looking at rural households living {{in some of the}} poorest districts of Peru, this study compares (using propensity score matching techniques) households located near rehabilitated roads to suitable controls. Results show that rehabilitated road accessibility can be related to changes in income sources, as the rehabilitated road enhances non-agricultural income opportunities, especially from wage-employment sources. The study also finds that income expansion is not been matched by an equivalent consumption increase; apparently because the additional income is allocated to <b>savings,</b> through increments <b>in</b> <b>livestock,</b> most likely because road quality improvement is being perceived as transitory.

40|$|Index {{insurance}} is a promising tool for fighting poverty where households face climactic uncertainty and incomplete financial markets. Although index insurance products avoid {{many of the}} costs that prohibit supply of conventional loss-indemnifying insurance for small holders in developing countries, index products expose insured households to basis risk because they can only insure covariate losses and indices are inevitably imperfect. Until now, no empirical study has examined the magnitude of basis risk {{in the context of}} the developing world. Nor have direct estimates of basis risk been included in demand analyses. Furthermore, the impacts of index based insurance on household welfare have been unknown. This dissertation looks closely at basis risk, demand, and impacts of index insurance. The Index Based Livestock Insurance (IBLI) product, available to pastoralists in northern Kenya since 2010, provides an ideal setting for such an analysis. The IBLI index was constructed using methods explicitly designed to minimize basis risk and implementation included an in-depth longitudinal household survey. The first paper finds that basis risk is substantial due to the high degree of variability between households and inaccuracies in the index. Although the existence of design risk is expected, the great deal of idiosyncratic risk is surprising in a region where large covariate droughts are known to be the major cause of livestock mortality. The second paper finds that product-related factors are at least as important as demographic and financial related characteristics in determining demand for IBLI. Both idiosyncratic risk and households' observed design risk play a large role in determining demand. In addition, a simplified premium schedule generated significant spatiotemporal adverse selection. The third paper finds that IBLI coverage reduces precautionary <b>savings</b> held <b>in</b> <b>livestock</b> and increases investments in productivity through mobility and livestock veterinary services. These adjustments to production strategies are associated with increases in income from milk and income per adult equivalent. When compared to the costs and impacts of the Hunger Safety Net Program, an ongoing cash transfer program in the same region, IBLI performs quite well and may become even more cost effective as the initial costs are spread across more clients. 2019 - 08 - 1...|$|R

40|$|<b>Livestock</b> {{holdings}} <b>in</b> {{rural areas}} of the West African Semi-arid Tropics (WASAT) are often substantial yet {{there is little evidence}} for precautionary <b>saving</b> <b>in</b> the form of livestock. This paper re-visits farm households' ability to smooth consumption ex post via <b>savings</b> <b>in</b> the form of livestock. Based on data covering Burkina Faso's 2004 drought, we find that livestock sales increase significantly in response to drought with households citing the need to finance food consumption. Some consumption smoothing is achieved via adjustments to grain stocks, but households apparently fail to smooth consumption by adjusting livestock holdings. We argue that this seemingly contradictory finding is largely due to a decrease <b>in</b> relative <b>livestock</b> prices during droughts. This renders selling livestock a costly coping strategy and underlines the need for market integration...|$|R
40|$|Increasing <b>livestock</b> product {{consumption}} <b>in</b> many Asian {{countries has}} been accompanied by growth in some countries’ imports of feedgrains for their domestic livestock sectors. This contributes to debate over future levels of grain imports. Yet projections often pay little attention to developments <b>in</b> <b>livestock</b> production. The impacts of technological catch‐up <b>in</b> <b>livestock</b> production on trade <b>in</b> <b>livestock</b> and grains products among countries in the Asia‐Pacific region are assessed.

40|$|Livestock {{housing is}} an {{important}} source of emissions of particulate matter (PM). High concentrations of PM can threaten the environment, as well as the health and welfare of humans and animals. Particulate matter <b>in</b> <b>livestock</b> houses is mainly coarse, primary in origin, and organic; it can adsorb and contain gases, odorous compounds, and micro-organisms, which can enhance its biological effect. Levels of PM <b>in</b> <b>livestock</b> houses are high, influenced by kind of housing and feeding, animal type, and environmental factors. Improved knowledge on particle morphology, primarily size, composition, levels, and the factors influencing these can be useful to identify and quantify sources of PM more accurately, to evaluate their effects, and to propose adequate abatement strategies <b>in</b> <b>livestock</b> houses. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of PM <b>in</b> and from <b>livestock</b> production systems. Future research to characterize and control PM <b>in</b> <b>livestock</b> houses is discussed.
