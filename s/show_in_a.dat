5|$|The planetarium {{remained}} at normal levels of service during this renovation period, but attendance dropped significantly, {{particularly when the}} adjacent museum was closed {{for a period of}} two years during the most intensive phase of its second major expansion. In all, the construction phase lasted for four years, from 1978 to 1982. In particular, some school groups that could justify the expense of seeing the museum and a planetarium <b>show</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> single day's outing had difficulty justifying a visit solely to the planetarium.|$|E

5|$|Davies' {{next project}} was The Grand, a period soap drama {{set in a}} Manchester hotel during the interwar period. It was {{designed}} to be a valuable <b>show</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ratings war with the BBC and was scheduled at 9pm on a Friday night. After the original writer abandoned the series, Granada approached him to write the entire show. His scripts for the first series reflect the pessimism of the period; each episode added its own emotional trauma on the staff, including a soldier's execution for desertion, a destitute maid who threatens to illegally abort her unborn child to survive, and a multi-episode storyline centred on the chambermaid, Monica Jones (Jane Danson), who kills her rapist in self-defence, is arrested, and eventually hanged for murder. The show was renewed for a second series despite the first's dark tone.|$|E
5|$|On December 21, Triple H {{announced}} that Hornswoggle {{was the new}} DX mascot.

The woman informs Ramudu that he had freed her from a hermit's curse and also reveals the sorcerer's intentions.

In return, the king lives up to his promise and accepts Indu's wishes to marry Ramudu.|$|E
5|$|Shawn Michaels {{returned}} on the June 12 {{episode of}} Raw and soon reunited with Triple H to re-form D-Generation X, turning Triple H into a fan favorite {{once again for}} the first time since 2002. DX defeated The Spirit Squad at Vengeance in a 5-on-2 handicap match. They continued their feud with Mr. McMahon, Shane McMahon and The Spirit Squad for several weeks. They then defeated The Spirit Squad again on the July 18, 2006 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event in a 5-on-2 elimination match. They then again defeated the McMahons at SummerSlam, withstanding the attack of several wrestlers who assaulted them before the match as directed by Mr. McMahon.

5|$|The other {{featured}} preliminary {{match was}} Kurt Angle versus The Big <b>Show</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> singles match.

The match ended in a no contest when The Big Show marked his return to SmackDown! by interfering in the match, chokeslamming both Angle and Guerrero in the process. The following week, Big Show was given two contracts to choose from; one contract to face Guerrero and one contract to face Angle. Big Show signed the contract with Guerrero's name on it. After signing it, Angle and his associate Luther Reigns, threw Guerrero {{out of the ring}} and offered Big Show a handshake.

5|$|Jim Ross, {{one of the}} draftees, {{was unaware}} he was to switch brands during the draft. After the draft, Ross {{was on the verge}} of quitting his job as a {{commentator}} for WWE, as he was angry at the fact he was leaving the Raw brand, where he had commentated for over ten years. Ross stated on his official blog that he was about to quit WWE, but he decided to continue to work for the company and make the best of working on SmackDown. After the Draft, the ECW brand was left without a world championship, after the ECW Champion Kane was drafted to Raw. As a result of pre-draft stipulations, champions took their championships to their new brand and made them property of that brand. SmackDown, however, lost their secondary championship, after United States Champion Matt Hardy was drafted to the ECW brand, in the process making the title ECW property, but gained another top-tier championship when WWE Champion Triple H was drafted to the SmackDown brand, in the process making the title SmackDown exclusive for the first time since 2005. The result of Triple H being drafted was the loss of the Raw brand's world championship. After the draft, the ECW Championship moved back to ECW when Mark Henry defeated Kane and The Big <b>Show</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Triple Threat match at Night of Champions, leaving Raw without any top-tier championships. On the June 30, 2008 episode of Raw, the Raw brand regained a world championship, after Money in the Bank contract holder, CM Punk, cashed in his contract and defeated the World Heavyweight Champion, Edge. Lastly, the United States Championship returned to SmackDown after Shelton Benjamin defeated Matt Hardy at The Great American Bash pay-per-view on July 20. Trevor Murdoch and Big Daddy V were both later released from WWE prior to their first appearances on SmackDown after being drafted. Chuck Palumbo was also later released from the WWE prior to his first appearance on Raw after being drafted.|$|E
