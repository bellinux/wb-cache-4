5|$|In {{conjunction}} with the Ardrossan Railway, which was regauged in 1840, on alternate days a fast <b>steamboat</b> service ran between Ardrossan Pier and Liverpool, and vice versa. This connected with the Grand Junction Railway and London and Birmingham Railway's expresses to London. In 1841 the <b>steamboat</b> service was transferred from Liverpool to the new Port at Fleetwood, Lancashire.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{commercial}} activities the Port of Albany has non-industrial uses along the river. A ship museum and a tourism cruise ship are docked at the <b>Steamboat</b> Square. <b>Steamboat</b> Square was, until 2010, named the Snow Dock for being where city trucks {{dumped into the}} Hudson River snow plowed from the streets. A PortFest was held in 2007 to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Port of Albany-Rennselaer and the 10th anniversary of the USS Slater as a museum docked at Albany. National Maritime Day is celebrated with free trolley rides of the port and free rides aboard the Dutch Apple Cruise.|$|E

5|$|At times, some ox cart trains {{did not go}} all the way through, {{but were}} {{supplemented}} by river craft. First flatboats and then shallow-draft steamboats ascended the Minnesota River to Traverse des Sioux and upstream points, where they were met by cart brigades travelling the West Plains Trail. In 1851, weekly <b>steamboat</b> service on the Mississippi began between Saint Anthony Falls and Sauk Rapids on the Middle and Woods trails. In 1859, <b>steamboat</b> machinery was carried overland to the Red River where a boat was built, but service was intermittent. The Dakota War of 1862 and the American Civil War delayed further improvements.|$|E
5|$|Elements of the 2nd SS Panzer Division {{arrive with}} {{infantry}} and armor.

Miller attempts to blow the bridge, but is shot and mortally wounded by <b>Steamboat</b> Willie, who has rejoined the Germans. Just before a Tiger tank reaches the bridge, an American P-51 Mustang flies overhead and destroys the tank, followed by American armored units which rout the remaining Germans. Witnessing Miller's shooting, Upham confronts <b>Steamboat</b> Willie and his group {{as they attempt to}} retreat. <b>Steamboat</b> Willie raises his hands in surrender, believing that Upham will accept because of their earlier encounter. Instead, Upham kills him, but lets the other Germans flee.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{had long}} been an {{acquaintance}} of John Fitch, the first to build a <b>steamboat</b> in the United States, and the two had worked together on steam projects. The Oruktor Amphibolos was Evans's lone attempt at building his own <b>steamboat</b> powered by a high-pressure engine and Evans himself was often vague in appraising its capabilities. Yet Robert Fulton had found success with the North River <b>Steamboat</b> on the Hudson River in 1807, and thereafter steamboats became a reality. Although he used low-pressure engines, Fulton had in 1812 contacted Evans {{about the possibility of}} using Evans's engines, though that correspondence did not lead to the implementation of any of Evans's designs for Fulton's steamships. The Mississippi and tributaries experienced far stronger currents than eastern counterparts, and low-pressure steamboats lacked the power to counteract these. The Enterprise was the first viable <b>steamboat</b> to run on these rivers, and its designer Daniel French employed an adapted Evans' engine for the purpose. High-pressure engines became the standard on the Mississippi, though relatively few of those were actually built by the Pittsburgh works as Evans' patent on high-pressure engines was not widely enforced, and many other engine shops opened on the Mississippi that freely adapted Evans' designs for their own purposes.|$|E

50|$|The point's name {{reflects}} {{the need of}} pioneer <b>steamboats</b> to be fueled with cordwood. Small <b>steamboats</b> would stop here at now-long-vanished wharves and fuel up. Later technology moved the primary fuel supply of Lake Huron <b>steamboats</b> from wood to coal, and the cordwood trade dwindled and died. When the county was organized into townships, Cordwood Point became part of Benton Township.|$|R
5|$|In this period, steamships on rivers {{such as the}} Ohio and Mississippi {{or large}} inland bodies of water such as the Great Lakes and the Chesapeake Bay offered a {{comfortable}} and relatively fast mode of transportation. The first <b>steamboat</b> to serve Baltimore was the locally built Chesapeake, constructed in 1813 to link Baltimore with Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Operated by the Union Line, the boat connected with a stagecoach for the overland portion of the journey. Two years later, the Briscoe-Partridge Line's Eagle was the first <b>steamboat</b> to sail the length of Chesapeake Bay.|$|E

50|$|In 1908, {{the company}} built the sternwheelers Shaver {{and a new}} Dixon as {{replacements}} for the old G.W. Shaver and Sarah Dixon. Typical for <b>steamboats</b> built in those days, the Shaver included previously-used mechanical components from other <b>steamboats.</b> In the Shavers case, these included steam valves that had served {{in at least two}} prior <b>steamboats</b> going back to 1857. Once built, Shaver was used as a tow and work boat.|$|R
50|$|Development of the mid-western and {{southern}} states drained by the Mississippi River system (Mississippi, Ohio and Missouri Rivers) was accelerated by {{the introduction of}} <b>steamboats</b> on these rivers in the early 19th Century. These three rivers (among others) also form the borders of several states. Prior to the introduction of <b>steamboats,</b> transit upstream was impractical because of strong currents on parts of these waterways. <b>Steamboats</b> provided both passenger and freight transportation until the development of railroads later in the 19th Century gradually reduced their presence.|$|R
5|$|<b>Steamboat</b> {{companies}} rightly saw nationwide railroads as {{a threat}} to their business. On May 6, 1856, just weeks after the bridge was completed, a <b>steamboat</b> captain deliberately crashed the Effie Afton into the bridge. The owner of the Effie Afton, John Hurd, filed a lawsuit against the Rock Island Railroad Company. Abraham Lincoln was the lead defense lawyer for the railroad company. The decision of the United States Supreme Court upheld the right to bridge navigable streams, therefore the bridge was allowed to remain.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the rugged}} terrain and rough waters {{on the two}} rivers, {{especially}} on the glacier-fed Kootenay, <b>steamboat</b> operation was extremely difficult and proved {{to be anything but}} cost effective. The roughest water was in Jennings Canyon, now mostly submerged in the Lake Koocanusa reservoir behind Libby Dam. Two of the first steamers, the Duchess and the Cline, both sank when transporting miners to the Wild Horse gold rush on the Kootenay. Both ships had not even reached Canal Flats when they hit rocks in the Columbia. The first <b>steamboat</b> to actually run the Kootenay was the Annerly in 1893. Later vessels, such as the Gwendoline, had mixed success. Captain Frank P. Armstrong, who had piloted several earlier steamboats on the Golden-Jennings run, was her builder and when she was about three-quarters completed, Armstrong decided to take her to Golden to complete the job. Gwendoline sailed up to the canal, which unfortunately was unusable because the gates of the lock had been dynamited due to a Kootenay flood. Armstrong was forced to portage the vessel and eventually made it to Golden. Gwendoline eventually sailed back south to Jennings to haul iron ore on the Kootenay. She was also the only ship to ever travel through the canal by proper means, and made two of the only three <b>steamboat</b> trips through the canal.|$|E
5|$|Before 1854, {{the area}} based around Bridgeton {{was a strong}} {{business}} and legal section in Cape May County. The local residents there, however, {{wanted to have a}} strong banking industry, but a local named Richard Holmes along with several other locals turned to the strong type of enterprise, a turnpike company. Holmes and the locals began a local turnpike syndicate with other businessmen and began the Cape May Turnpike Company upon incorporation in 1854. The turnpike company, upon incorporation, was to build a toll road along roughly the U.S. Route 9 corridor. Progress in constructing the toll road was slow at first, with subscribers from Cape May County being hesitant to buy stock from the turnpike company. A friend of Richard Holmes, Wilmon Whilldin, owned a <b>steamboat</b> company in Cape May and apologized for not buying stock in the company. Citing the Panic of 1857 made it hard to convert securities to cash, Whilldin suggested that a <b>steamboat</b> would be more profitable than the turnpike. The money from the <b>steamboat</b> would go ahead and helped the financially depressed businesses in local communities.|$|E
5|$|Chester J. Lampwick created Itchy for the now-lost silent cartoon Manhattan Madness, {{in which}} the mouse brutally attacks and kills an Irishman and Theodore Roosevelt, in 1919 (the year of the first Felix the Cat cartoon).

The film, a 13-second-long animation showing the cat whistling and tipping his hat, was a commercial failure. Later that year, Itchy and Scratchy starred in their first cartoon together, <b>Steamboat</b> Itchy, a violent parody of Disney's <b>Steamboat</b> Willie. Along with the cartoon shorts, Itchy and Scratchy were featured in a World War II-era radio series, at least two films — Pinitchio and Scratchtasia (parodies of Pinocchio and Fantasia), and television commercials for Laramie Cigarettes.|$|E
