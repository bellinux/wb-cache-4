Bias currents have been decreased by 5 orders of magnitude over the past 5 years. Low offset voltage drift is also necessary in a high accuracy circuits. This is evidenced by the popularity of low drift amplifier types as well as the requests for selected low-drift op amps. However, until now the chopper <b>stabilized</b> <b>amplifier</b> offered the lowest drift.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we compare}} three {{different}} conditioning and readout electronics for CMOS convective accelerometers. The work {{is based on}} both characterization results and high-level simulations. The three following architectures are evaluated: (i) a simple amplifier, (ii) a chopper <b>stabilized</b> <b>amplifier,</b> and (iii) an innovative 1 st-order thermal sigma-delta modulator. Experimental data are obtained using the hybrid combination of a 0. 8 µm CMOS integrated sensor and discrete electronics. Behavioral simulations were carried-out under Matlab®/Simulink® using small-signal models. The sensor model includes performance-limiting thermal phenomena and 1 /f noise contributions.

This research presents on a CMOS sensor, {{which includes a}} chopper <b>stabilized</b> front-end <b>amplifier</b> with DC suppressed feedback and a 12 -bit successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with background calibration. It could reduce the flicker noise interference in the low frequency and suppressed the DC offset voltage between the two input signals. Therefore, this structure is suitable for bio-medical applications. The bio-medical signals are smaller than 5 mV in the low frequency between 0. 01 Hz and 1 kHz. After amplifying, the signals will be digitized by a 12 -bit SAR ADC. The chopper <b>stabilized</b> <b>amplifier</b> has a clock rate, 16 kHz, controlling the chopper switches and shifting the original signals to 16 kHz in order to reducing the flicker noise. In our case, the flicker noise could lower at least 80 times at this clock rate. The two-Thomas Biquad low-pass filter, as the anti-aliasing filter, could suppress the harmonic signals at least 40 dB before digitalized by ADC. For the 12 -bit SAR ADC, the differential nonlinearity (DNL) is + 0. 576 /- 0. 96 least significant bit (LSB), and the integral nonlinearity (INL) is + 0. 534 /- 0. 655 LSB. The signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) can be estimated 69 dB. The effective number of bits (ENOB) is 11. 17.

40|$|Determination of the Order of the Amplifier Typically, when a dc gain {{of close}} to 80 dB or more is {{required}} from a multistage amplifier with simple, nancascode gain stages, people resort to using either 3 stage or 4 stage amplifiers.

40|$|Using calomel {{electrodes}} and chopper <b>stabilized</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> sensory evoked d-c responses at the {{cortical surface}} were recorded {{from the primary}} visual, secondary visual, auditory and somatic areas of the left hemisphere in thirty acutely prepared immobilized cats. The stimuli were light from an incandescent bulb, a hissing sound and a mild shock. Responses were quantified on line by automatic computation of area under the response and by waveform averaging. All four cortical loci could respond to all three stimuli, but by an algebraic analysis of response amplitudes the responses could be fractionated into two components, {{one of which was}} localized, the other diffuse. The local component is stimulus bound and is distributed such that the response of the classical sensory area relevant to the stimulus is negative to the response of the other sensory areas, regardless of the over-all response polarity. The diffuse component is on the average, negative in polarity and has a longer latency and duration than the local component. It occurs primarily as an aftereffect of stimulation and is more readily evoked by shock and hiss than by light. The diffure component and the local component are, therefore, distinguished from one another both by their localization and their time course. Both the diffuse component and the local component showed considerable habituation during a 1. 5 to 2. 0 hour long series of fifty stimulations. The responses probably reflect the joint action of both specific and diffuse cortical inputs, but it is unlikely that they influence the production of action potentials in cortical neurons...|$|R

50|$|Harold Stephen Black (April 14, 1898 - December 11, 1983) was an American {{electrical}} engineer, who {{revolutionized the}} field of applied electronics by inventing the negative feedback amplifier in 1927. To some, his invention is considered the most important breakthrough {{of the twentieth century}} in {{the field of}} electronics, since it has a wide area of application. This is because all electronic devices (vacuum tubes, bipolar transistors and MOS transistors) are inherently nonlinear, but they can be made substantially linear with the application of negative feedback. Negative feedback works by sacrificing gain for higher linearity (or in other words, smaller distortion/intermodulation). By sacrificing gain, it also has an additional effect of increasing the bandwidth of the amplifier. However, a negative feedback amplifier can be unstable such that it may oscillate. Once the stability problem is solved, the negative feedback amplifier is extremely useful in the field of electronics. Black published a famous paper, <b>Stabilized</b> feedback <b>amplifiers,</b> in 1934.|$|R

40|$|Pipelined ADCs require {{accurate}} amplification; however traditional OTAs limit {{power efficiency}} since they require high quiescent current for slewing. In addi-tion, {{it is difficult}} to design low-voltage OTAs in modern, scaled CMOS. The ring amplifier [1 - 4] provides an intriguing alternative to traditional OTAs. This work improves the power efficiency and practicality of the ring amplifier by introduc-ing a self-biasing scheme and by eliminating the comparators.

To prevent oscillation, [3] splits the second stage into two separately biased AC-coupled inverters. The bias voltages VRP and VRN are tuned to ensure that the 3 rd-stage transistors MCP and MCN enter deep sub-threshold as VIN approaches the desired virtual ground voltage, so that the output-stage resistance increases dramatically, and forms a dominant pole that <b>stabilizes</b> the <b>amplifier.</b> (A related consideration for stability [3] is that the peak overdrive voltage applied to the output transistors should decrease during each successive oscillation period.)

40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} {{the use of}} pole zero identification method to stabilize a 2. 32 - 2. 37 GHz class AB power amplifier. In addition, the thesis presents a procedure to obtain values of stabilization components. Power amplifiers are used to drive transmitting antennas with high power in applications such as RADAR’s, cellular base stations and RF-driven lighting. They operate at large signal level to achieve these high output power levels. This {{increases the risk of}} potential oscillations in power amplifiers, which are undetectable using conventional linear stability factors. The oscillations degrade amplifier’s performance and may cause interference and transistor burnout. Non-applicability of linear stability factors for large-signal operation has led to development of new stability analysis methods such as Ohtomo, NDF and AG. Ability to detect oscillation due to large-signal has been the priority of these methods. A drawback is that, they are either complex to use or not fully complete in <b>stabilizing</b> a power <b>amplifier.</b> A recent method based on pole zero identification is shown to be rigorous and simple to use. However, this method requires a special additional software STability ANalysis(STAN) to identify poles and zeros of power amplifiers. This work utilized a simulation template in ADS 2011 to design the 2. 32 - 2. 37 GHz class AB power amplifier. The template requires measured load pull data of the transistor used in the amplifier design. The realized design has met maximum performance in first trial with little optimization. This design approach is useful to circumvent modeling problems in power transistors. However, the stability analysis is highly dependent on the transistor model accuracy.
