In 1908 it was discovered, the Admiralty had, in fact, changed the <b>signal</b> <b>code</b> in November 1803, after the 1799 version had been captured by the French, and new code books had been issued to Nelson's fleet at Cadiz in September 1805. As a result, books published between these two dates show the signal using the wrong flags.|$|E
25|$|On May 27, 1863, {{during the}} Siege of Vicksburg, Mississippi, Cincinnati {{was ordered to}} steam down the Mississippi River and destroy two Confederate {{artillery}} guns which were impeding the advance of General William Tecumseh Sherman's right flank. Between Cincinnati and the two guns was a Confederate eleven-piece heavy artillery battery which, from its position atop a bluff, had command over that entire stretch of the river. The Union forces had {{been aware of the}} battery, but, shortly before Cincinnati received its orders, the battery had disappeared and was assumed to have been moved elsewhere. Unbeknownst to them, the battery's guns had been removed from view by simply lowering them from their carriages, both to protect them from the fire of ships on the river and to deceive the Union forces. The commander of the battery had discovered the Union <b>signal</b> <b>code,</b> and when he intercepted a message describing Cincinnatis mission, he had the guns re-assembled during the night and concealed them in brush.|$|E
25|$|Villeneuve led {{the rest}} of his fleet into Cadiz on 21 August 1805, and the Sirius was sent to form part of the British fleet blockading them there. With Nelson's arrival to take command of the fleet, the main body was moved out to sea, with a chain of four frigates and four ships of the line {{established}} to observe the fleet in Cadiz and transmit signals about their movements to the British fleet. Sirius was the closest to the port and at first light on 19 October it was observed that the enemy were preparing to put to sea. Sirius immediately signalled the next frigate in the line, Henry Blackwood's , 'Enemy have their topsails hoisted'. Thus Prowse began the process that would lead to the interception of the combined fleet two days later. An hour later at 7 a.m. Sirius ran up three flags to <b>signal</b> <b>code</b> number 370, 'Enemy ships are coming out of port or getting under sail'. The signal was repeated down the line, reaching Nelson 48 miles away aboard HMS Victory at 9.30 a.m.|$|E

500|$|Use of the Saltire at sea as a Jack or {{courtesy}} flag has been observed, including as a Jack on the Scottish Government's Marine Partrol Vessel (MPV) Jura. [...] The ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne routinely flies the Saltire as a Jack on vessels {{which have a}} bow staff, including when such vessels are underway. This practice has also been observed on the Paddle Steamer Waverley when operating {{in and around the}} Firth of Clyde. The practice of maritime vessels adopting the Saltire, for use as a jack or {{courtesy flag}}, may lead to possible confusion in that the Saltire closely resembles the maritime signal flag M, [...] "MIKE", which is used to indicate [...] "My vessel is stopped; making no way." [...] Obviously mariners who understand this <b>signal</b> <b>code</b> also understand that the saltire is displayed on the jackstaff and not as a signal. For the benefit of Scottish seafarers wishing to display a Scottish flag other than the Saltire, thereby avoiding confusion and a possible fine, a campaign was launched in November 2007 seeking official recognition for the historic Scottish Red Ensign. Despite having last been used officially by the pre-Union Royal Scots Navy and merchant marine fleets in the 18th century, the flag continues to be produced by flag manufacturers and its unofficial use by private citizens on water has been observed.|$|E
