5|$|In 2013, China led {{the world}} in {{renewable}} energy production, with a total capacity of 378 GW, mainly from hydroelectric and wind power. As of 2014, China leads {{the world in}} the production and use of wind power, <b>solar</b> <b>photovoltaic</b> power and smart grid technologies, generating almost as much water, wind and solar energy as all of France and Germany's power plants combined. China's renewable energy sector is growing faster than its fossil fuels and nuclear power capacity. Since 2005, production of solar cells in China has expanded 100-fold. As Chinese renewable manufacturing has grown, the costs of renewable energy technologies have dropped. Innovation has helped, but the main driver of reduced costs has been market expansion.|$|E
