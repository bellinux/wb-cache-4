40|$|Abstract. Despite {{the massive}} {{participation}} {{of young people}} in the Italian university system, the share of university graduates is one of the lowest in Europe. This paper seeks to investigate the reasons of this paradox by looking at the theory of investment in human capital. The annual rate of return to high education in Italy are just below those in other countries, while the direct and indirect costs are similar to (if not lower than) those in other EU countries. These factors hence cannot explain the low average educational level of Italian young people. The proposed explanation of this paper is the enormous time necessary to achieve a university degree: this reduces the cumulated return to education, while dramatically increasing the opportunity cost of education. Heckprobit estimates of the returns to education in terms of employment opportunities as based on Household Survey data (SHIW) suggest that education is a statistically significant predictor of employment only for the over- 30. Similar conclusions can be drawn for returns to education estimated by a Heckit model on the same data. This suggests that the ineffective working of the university system truncates the earnings profile of graduates as compared to individuals with <b>a</b> high school <b>dimploma...</b>|$|R

This study sought to 1) better understand why undergraduate students <b>study</b> <b>an</b> exercise science-related major, 2) determine whether positive influences to <b>study</b> <b>an</b> exercise science-related major differ by academic classification, and 3) identify what student’s aspirations are after graduation. Department administrators from four-year colleges and universities offering an exercise science-related major in the Northwest Region of the United States (i. e., Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington) were contacted. Cooperating department administrators were given self-reported questionnaires for students to complete using a snowball sampling method. A total of 388 participants completed the questionnaire. Interest in the subject and potential job opportunities were the most common reasons to <b>study</b> <b>an</b> exercise science-related major. Self-reported Holland’s codes identified that realistic and social personalities were most prevalent among participants.
