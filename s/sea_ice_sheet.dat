After the ice sheets had melted away from the Irish Sea but before vegetation had taken hold and before the sea reflooded that basin, blowing sand drifted across Merseyside to form what is now known as the Shirdley Hill Sand, a sheetlike deposit up to 2.5m thick in places.

However, reworking of older sea-floor sediments and landforms during repeated Quaternary advances across the shelf typically obscures their longer-term behaviour, which hampers our understanding. Here, we provide the first detailed long-term record of Barents <b>Sea</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>Sheet</b> advances, using the timing of debris-flows on the Bear Island Trough-Mouth Fan. Ice advanced to the shelf edge during four distinct periods over the last 140, 000 years. By far the largest sediment volumes were delivered during the oldest advance more than 128, 000 years ago. Later advances occurred from 68, 000 to 60, 000, 39, 400 to 36, 000 and 26, 000 to 20, 900 years before present.

40|$|Flexural {{oscillations}} {{of floating}} <b>sea</b> <b>ice</b> <b>sheets</b> induced by ocean waves travelling at {{the boundary between}} the ice and the water below can propagate great distances. But, by virtue of scattering, changes of ice thickness and other properties encountered during the journey affect their passage, notwithstanding attenuation arising from several other naturally occurring agencies. We describe here a two-dimensional model that can simulate wave scattering by long (approx. 50 [*]km) stretches of inelastic <b>sea</b> <b>ice,</b> the goal being to replicate heterogeneity accurately while also assimilating supplementary processes that lead to energy loss in <b>sea</b> <b>ice</b> at scales that are amenable to experimental validation. In work concerned with scattering from solitary or juxtaposed stylized features in the <b>sea</b> <b>ice</b> canopy, reflection and transmission coefficients are commonly used to quantify scattering, but on this occasion, we use the attenuation coefficient as we consider that it provides a more helpful description when dealing with long sequences of adjoining scatterers. Results show that scattering and viscosity both induce exponential decay and we observe three distinct regimes: (i) low period, where scattering dominates, (ii) high period, where viscosity dominates, and (iii) a transition regime.

40|$|Five {{regionally}} significant Weichselian glacial events, each {{separated by}} terrestrial and marine interstadial conditions, are described from northwestern Russia. The first glacial event {{took place in}} the Early Weichselian. An ice sheet centred in the Kara Sea area dammed up a large lake in the Pechora lowland. Water was discharged across a threshold on the Timan Ridge and via an ice-free corridor between the Scandinavian Ice Sheet and the Kara <b>Sea</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>Sheet</b> to the west and north into the Barents Sea. The next glaciation occurred around 7570 kyr BP after an interstadial episode that lasted c. 15 kyr. A local ice cap developed over the Timan Ridge at the transition to the Middle Weichselian. Shortly after deglaciation of the Timan ice cap, an ice sheet centred in the Barents Sea reached the area. The configuration of this ice sheet suggests that it was confluent with the Scandinavian Ice Sheet. Consequently, around 7065 kyr BP a huge ice-dammed lake formed in the White Sea basin (the ‘White Sea Lake’), only now the outlet across the Timan Ridge discharged water eastward into the Pechora area. The Barents <b>Sea</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>Sheet</b> likely suffered marine down-draw that led to its rapid collapse. The White Sea Lake drained into the Barents Sea, and marine inundation and interstadial conditions followed between 65 and 55 kyr BP. The glaciation that followed was centred in the Kara Sea area around 5545 kyr BP. Northward directed fluvial runoff in the Arkhangelsk region indicates that the Kara <b>Sea</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>Sheet</b> was independent of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet and that the Barents Sea remained ice free.

Chronologic control is provided by AMS 14 C, electron-spin resonance, green-stimulated luminescence, and aspartic-acid geochronology. Major glaciations followed by deglaciation and marine inundation occurred during MIS 10 - 9, MIS 8 - 7, MIS 6 - 5 e and MIS 5 d- 3. The MIS 6 - 5 e event, associated with the high marine limit, implies ice-sheet thickness of > 2000 m only 200 km from the deep Arctic Ocean, consistent with published evidence of ice grounding at 1000 m water depth in the central Arctic Ocean. Till fabrics and glacial tectonics record repeated expansions of local ice caps exclusively, suggesting wet-based ice cap advance followed by cold-based regional ice-sheet expansion.

40|$|Abstract—This work is an {{examination}} of potential uses of multiangular remote sensing imagery for mapping and charac-terizing <b>sea</b> <b>ice</b> and <b>ice</b> <b>sheet</b> surfaces based on surface roughness properties. We use data from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRa-diometer (MISR) to demonstrate that <b>ice</b> <b>sheet</b> and <b>sea</b> <b>ice</b> surfaces have characteristic angular signatures and that these angular sig-natures {{may be used in}} much the same way as spectral signatures are used in multispectral classification. Three case studies are examined: <b>sea</b> <b>ice</b> in the Beaufort Sea off the north coast of Alaska, the Jakobshavn Glacier on the western edge of the Greenland <b>ice</b> <b>sheet,</b> and a region in Antarctica south of McMurdo station containing glaciers and blue-ice areas. The MISR <b>sea</b> <b>ice</b> image appears to delineate different first-year ice types and, to some extent, the transition from first-year to multiyear ice. The MISR image shows good agreement with <b>sea</b> <b>ice</b> types that are evident in concurrent synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery and ice analysis charts from the National Ice Center. Over the Jakobshavn Glacier, surface roughness data from airborne laser altimeter transects correlate well with MISR-derived estimates of surface roughness. In Antarctica, ablation-related blue-ice areas, which are difficult to distinguish from bare ice exposed by crevasses, are easily detected using multiangular data. These unusual ablation surfaces are smooth and, unlike nearby crevassed ice, are strongly forward scattering. These case studies demonstrate that MISR data can make an innovative and important contribution to remote sensing of <b>ice</b> <b>sheet</b> and <b>sea</b> <b>ice</b> surface properties...|$|R
