40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a process for the electrochemmical analysis of solutions, as used, for example, in chemical analysis or for checking purposes in industry and environmental engineering. Individual <b>substances</b> are <b>detected</b> by depositing them on electrodes followed by detection of the deposited substances. Whereas, in known processes, all the <b>substances</b> to be <b>detected</b> are deposited on an electrode and detected one after the other, in the process according to the invention, numerous electrodes are used. The <b>substances</b> to be <b>detected</b> are deposited from the solution simultaneously onto these electrodes {{in such a way}} that every electrode receives the deposit of a different substance or a different substance mixture. Then the deposited <b>substances</b> are <b>detected</b> simultaneously on each of the electrodes. This drastically shortens the measuring time and the risk of incorrect measurements is greatly reduced due to interactions between the <b>substances</b> to be <b>detected</b> on the electrodes...|$|R

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of type E botulism {{is discussed}} as {{an aspect of}} the physicochemical and biological properties of 12 S toxins (prototoxin and trypsin-activated 12 S toxin) and the Eα and Eβ components of each 12 S toxin. A molecular weight of 350, 000 was determined for each 12 S toxin and 150, 000 for Eα and Eβ. Owing to the structure comprising the subunits Eα and Eβ, 12 S toxins are much more stable than Eα at low pH values and high temperatures. Such was also the case with type A 19 S toxin and its α component. The Eα component alone accounts for the total toxicity of type E toxin. The toxic <b>substance</b> <b>detected</b> in the blood of the animals administered 12 S toxins orally or parenterally was identified as Eα from the molecular size and the chromatographic pattern. Prototoxin escaping from detoxification in the stomach owing to the subunit structure may undergo dissociation in the intestine to release the Eα component.

In the present study, we examined using biochemical and biological methods {{whether there is a}} CT-like substance in the plasma of the hagfish, Eptatretus burgeri. Hagfish plasma was first subjected to reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and then separated into twenty fractions. The presence of immunoreactive CT in each fraction was then investigated by Western blotting with salmon CT antiserum. Two fractions (36 - 39 % CH 3 CN; 39 - 42 % CH 3 CN) showed positive immunoreactivity. Hypocalcemic and hypophosphatemic activities were detected by a rat bioassay only in the former fraction (36 - 39 % CH 3 CN). The molecular weight (MW) of the CT-like substance in this fraction was 3. 5 kDa, which is equal to that of genuine CT. Furthermore, when hagfish plasma was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using anti-salmon CT, the dilution curve of the plasma paralleled the standard curve of salmon CT. The CT-like <b>substance</b> <b>detected</b> here was present at a high concentration (14 ng/ml) in the plasma.

The in vitro and in vivo suppressor {{effects of the}} most highly purified fraction of CEP-Si, designated fraction 3 ' (F 3 'EP-Si), corresponded well with those of the original CEP-Si. F 3 'EP-Si was sensitive to the effects of alpha, gamma, and delta chymotrypsin, trypsin, and heating. It contained approximately 1 % of the total amount of protein found in the original CEP-Si, corresponding to a single band on analytical isoelectric focusing, stainable by Coomassie Blue and of isoelectric point of 4. 25. The absorption spectrum of F 3 'EP-Si had a maximum at 260 nm but its biological activity was resistant to deoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease A and it did not contain material stainable by methylene blue. It was also resistant to neuraminidase and did not contain material stainable by periodic acid schiff. We conclude that the substance responsible for the suppressor activity of CEP-Si is a protein of molecular weight approximately 90, 000, which adheres to Sephadex of cellulose acetate and forms complexes with other, nonactive constituents of CEP-Si...|$|E

40|$|Two {{retrospective}} epidemiologic {{studies have}} shown that cannabis is the main psychoactive <b>substance</b> <b>detected</b> in the blood of drivers suspected of driving under the influence of psychotropic drugs. An oral administration double-blind crossover study was carried out with eight healthy male subjects, aged 22 to 30 years, all occasional cannabis smokers. Three treatments and one placebo were administered to all participants at a two week interval: 20 mg dronabinol, 16. 5 mg D 9 -tétrahydrocannabinol (THC) and 45. 7 mg THC as a cannabis milk decoction. Participants were asked to report the subjective drug effects and their willingness to drive under various circumstances on a visual analog scale. Clinical observations, a psychomotor test and a tracking test on a driving simulator were also carried out. Compared to cannabis smoking, THC, 11 -OH-THC and THC-COOH blood concentrations remained low through the whole study (&lt; 13. 1 ng THC/mL,&lt; 24. 7 ng 11 -OH-THC/mL and&lt; 99. 9 ng THC-COOH/mL). Two subjects experienced deep anxiety symptoms suggesting that this unwanted side-effect may occur when driving under the influence of cannabis or when driving and smoking a joint. No clear association could be found between these adverse reactions and a susceptibility gene to propensity to anxiety and psychotic symptoms (genetic polymorphism of the catechol-O-methyltransferase). The questionnaires have shown that the willingness to drive was lower when the drivers were assigned an insignificant task and was higher when the mission was of crucial importance. The subjects were aware of the effects of cannabis and their performances on the road sign and tracking test were greatly impaired, especially after ingestion of the strongest dose.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The popularization of {{anonymous}} markets such as Silk Road is challenging current drug policy and {{may provide a}} new context for old issues, such as adulteration of heroin with fentanyl derivatives. The aims of this paper are to report the presence of ocfentanil, a novel, potent, non-controlled fentanyl analog, in samples sold as heroin in the hidden web, and to summarize the effects reported by users. METHODS: In 2015, four samples allegedly bought as heroin in cryptomarkets of the hidden web were sent to Energy Control for analysis. Energy Control is a Spanish harm reduction NGO that offers anonymous drug checking {{with the purpose of}} adapting counselling to the specific substances present in the drug and monitor the drug market. Identification was performed by GC/MS and LC/MS/MS. We contacted the submitters of the samples and performed an Internet search to retrieve additional information. RESULTS: One sample contained ocfentanil, caffeine and heroin. Three samples contained the aforementioned substances plus paracetamol. Two out of the four contacted users reported distinct short acting, opioid-like effects. No fora discussion could be found about the effects of ocfentanil, neither web pages nor individuals advertising the substance. CONCLUSION: We report the presence of a new <b>substance</b> <b>detected</b> in the hidden web as an adulterant of heroin, ocfentanil. It has short acting opioid-like effects, roughly the same potency as fentanyl, and can be injected, snorted or smoked. Severe side effects have been associated with its use, including one death. No discussion about this substance could be found in the Internet, which suggests this substance has not been sold as such. Available data about purities of drugs purchased in cryptomarkets suggest that adulteration is not a severe problem and this agrees with users' perceptions. However, this study suggests that adulteration is a real threat not only at the street level, but also for users that buy substances in cryptomarkets, and suggest the need for harm reduction initiatives in this setting...|$|E
40|$|The {{choice of}} {{stormwater}} procedures {{will affect the}} pathways {{of the water and}} its pollutants, since different stormwater facilities reduce different types of substances and fractions to varying degrees. Traditional stormwater handling has mainly been emphasised to transport the water from the cities. However, during the last year, the interest in environmental aspects has increased. Different ecological solutions, such as infiltration, wetlands, and swales will affect the path of water and its substances. The main objective of this thesis is to characterize and study the pathways of pollutants (heavy metal and organic substances) in stormwater systems. The main focus has been on gully pot water and sediment after it has been removed from the grit chamber. In order to study the pathways of pollutants, a substance flow analysis was done in Hammarby Sjöstad. Since no measurements were possible in the area, theoretical calculations were performed. The results show that, in a separate system with treatment, most of the pollutants will end up in the sediment or soil, depending on which BMP is used. The largest amount of pollutants will be discharged to receiving waters with a separate system without treatment. The samples of gully pot water and sediment were taken during the autumn 2004 in Luleå, Sweden. Three different sites were chosen due to different types of area and traffic loads: a residential area with 500 v/d and two sites in the city with different traffic intensities, 13, 800 v/d and 25, 500 v/d, respectively. The water samples were analysed for particle-size distribution, suspended solids (SS), heavy metals, PAH, phthalate, and nonylphenols, while the sediment samples were analysed for particle-size distribution and heavy metals. The metals in the water phase were analysed for six fractions: truly dissolved (< 1 kD), colloids, < 0. 2 µm, < 0. 45 µm, and two different extracted fractions. The results showed that the gully pot mixture (water and sediment) contained a wide range of substances. For the different fractions in the water phase, the highest concentration of metals varied between the three sampling sites. All analysed metals were found in the mixture and, out of 29 organic substances, 18 were detected. Most of the metals and PAH were attached to particles in the water. The concentration of PAH was highest in the city with 13, 800 v/d. The only phthalates <b>substance</b> <b>detected</b> in all three areas was di-(2 -etylhexyl) phthalate and the highest total concentration was found in the residential area. The concentration of total 4 -nonylphenol was detected only in the residential area. The sediment's smallest fraction (< 63 µm) had the highest concentration of metals. The leaching test indicates that the metals in the sediment are harder bound in the city. However, in the water, the metals are harder bound in the residential area. The water exceeds the guidelines for freshwater for most of the substances, while the sediment only exceeds the guidelines for soil for a few substances. This indicates that the gully pot mixture must undergo treatment before it can be discharged to the environment. Godkänd; 2006; 20070109 (haneit...|$|E

Our aim was {{to investigate}} the Saudi experience of anti-doping and review all positive samples and adverse analytical findings (AAFs) of Saudi athletes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study analyzed databases of the Saudi Arabian Anti-Doping Committee from 2008 to May 2016. The samples originated from various sporting events and were collected in and outside sport competitions. The substances investigated were those included in the annual lists of prohibited substances produced by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). All urine samples were tested in laboratories accredited by the WADA. Samples were declared positive if they contained any prohibited substance on the WADA list for that year. RESULTS: In 4482 urine samples tested, 141 positive samples (3. 1 %) and 195 AAFs of prohibited <b>substances</b> were <b>detected.</b> The prevalence of positive samples was highest in 2012 (6. 6 %) and lowest in 2015 (1 %).
