40|$|A {{method of}} {{laboratory}} dyeing {{has been studied}} {{as well as the}} disperse dye selection for detecting the skittteriness that may be caused in the polyester afterdyeing, owing to structural differences caused by variations in the conditions of obtaining the fibre and aftertreatment, previous to dyeing. We arrived {{to the conclusion that the}} method that most aggravates the existing differences is that of dyeing at 100 Â°C in presence of a carrier based on O-phenyl-phenol and two dyes have been selected: C. I. Disperse Blue 79 with high detection. C. I. Disperse Blue 56 with high cover. with the aim of estimating if it will appear skitterines in a determined polyester, and if this <b>skitteriness</b> can be prevented by a correct disperse dye selection. It has been verified that the visual grading method with the grey scale, for estimating the degree of <b>skitteriness,</b> presents a good correlation with the instrumental measuring of the colour differenees after the ANS formula (40) ...|$|E
