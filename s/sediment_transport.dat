5|$|The Doom Bar is a sandbar at {{the mouth}} of the Camel estuary on the north coast of Cornwall. The bar is {{composed}} mostly of coarse sediment carried up from the seabed by bed load processes, and it has been shown that there is a net inflow of sediment into the estuary. This inflow is aided by wave and tidal processes, but the exact patterns of <b>sediment</b> <b>transport</b> within the estuary are complex and are not fully understood. There is only a very small sediment contribution from the River Camel itself: most of the river's sediment is deposited much higher up the estuary.|$|E
25|$|Bedforms are {{generated}} by aeolian <b>sediment</b> <b>transport</b> in the terrestrial near-surface environment. Ripples and dunes form {{as a natural}} self-organizing response to <b>sediment</b> <b>transport.</b>|$|E
25|$|Coastal <b>sediment</b> <b>transport</b> {{takes place}} in {{near-shore}} environments due to the motions of waves and currents. At the mouths of rivers, coastal sediment and fluvial <b>sediment</b> <b>transport</b> processes mesh to create river deltas.|$|E

25|$|<b>Sediment</b> <b>transport</b> is {{important}} in the fields of sedimentary geology, geomorphology, civil engineering and environmental engineering (see applications, below). Knowledge of <b>sediment</b> <b>transport</b> is most often used to determine whether erosion or deposition will occur, the magnitude of this erosion or deposition, and the time and distance over which it will occur.|$|E
25|$|When {{used for}} <b>sediment</b> <b>transport</b> formulae, this ratio is {{typically}} raised to a power.|$|E
25|$|The {{equations}} included here describe <b>sediment</b> <b>transport</b> for clastic, or granular sediment. They do {{not work}} for clays and muds because these types of floccular sediments do not fit the geometric simplifications in these equations, and also interact thorough electrostatic forces. The equations were also designed for fluvial <b>sediment</b> <b>transport</b> of particles carried along in a liquid flow, such as that in a river, canal, or other open channel.|$|E
25|$|A {{sedimentary}} rock formed on land has a continental sedimentary environment. Examples of continental environments are lagoons, lakes, swamps, floodplains and alluvial fans. In the quiet water of swamps, lakes and lagoons, fine sediment is deposited, mingled with organic material from dead plants and animals. In rivers, {{the energy of}} the water is much greater and can transport heavier clastic material. Besides <b>transport</b> by water, <b>sediment</b> can in continental environments also be transported by wind or glaciers. <b>Sediment</b> <b>transported</b> by wind is called aeolian and is always very well sorted, while <b>sediment</b> <b>transported</b> by a glacier is called glacial till and is characterized by very poor sorting.|$|R
40|$|The {{sedimentary}} dynamic at Las Canteras {{beach is}} characterised {{by means of}} beach profiles data. A very strong seasonal pattern has been shown, consisting on succesive erosions and accretions coupled with an important volume of <b>sediments</b> <b>transported</b> all along the beach.

50|$|The Wildsee is {{threatened}} by silting up {{as a result of}} the <b>sediment</b> <b>transported</b> to it by the Haglbach. In future a pond will be excavated east of Innsbrucker Straße in order to trap the sediment. There is also discussion about enlarging the lake.|$|R

25|$|<b>Sediment</b> <b>transport</b> {{is applied}} to solve many environmental, geotechnical, and {{geological}} problems. Measuring or quantifying <b>sediment</b> <b>transport</b> or erosion is therefore important for coastal engineering. Several sediment erosion devices have been designed in order to quantitfy sediment erosion (e.g., Particle Erosion Simulator (PES)).

40|$|Abstract. To {{determine}} the optimum {{width of a}} buffer strip in wooded and grassy areas, a small scale model in each type of area was developed. Simulated rainfall was used to <b>transport</b> <b>sediment</b> suspended in runoff. Sediment catchment devices were developed and then implemented at various widths downslope from a tilled area. These devices collected and trapped sediment that was suspended in the runoff. Three simulated rainfall events were performed. It was determined that the grassy site restrained more sediment in the runoff {{as compared to the}} wooded site in the fall season. Also, more rainfall resulted in more <b>sediment</b> <b>transported</b> downslope. It was observed that the <b>sediment</b> was <b>transported</b> downslope only after the tilled area was saturated with water, which occurred at approximately one inch of rain...|$|R

Hence some {{researchers}} have been moved to suggest a European origin {{for at least some}} H3/6 clasts: America and Europe were originally adjacent to one another; hence, the rocks on each continent are difficult to distinguish, and the source is open to interpretation (Grousset et al. 2000).|$|R
40|$|The Causeway Lake {{having an}} area of about 86 ha {{represents}} an artificially created lake in the estuary having restricted connection with the sea by the bridge width and bridge sill elevation. It {{is located on the}} Capricorn Coast, Queensland. The lake is a sink for suspended <b>sediment</b> <b>transported</b> from the sea by the tidal currents as well as for <b>sediment</b> <b>transported</b> from the catchment by the creeks when the intensity of the rainfall is sufficiently high. During 65 years, since the lake creation, the siltation significantly reduced usability of the lake as a recreational area for fishing and sporting activities. It is no longer accessible by yachts or motorboats because of the large area of the lake which has a depth below 0. 5 m. The report discusses the sources and progress in siltation of the lake. The probable quantities of the sediment entering the lake from the sea and from the catchment were estimated...|$|R
25|$|Aeolian <b>sediment</b> <b>transport</b> {{is common}} on beaches {{and in the}} arid regions of the world, because it is in these environments that {{vegetation}} does not prevent the presence and motion of fields of sand.|$|E
25|$|Formulas to {{calculate}} <b>sediment</b> <b>transport</b> rate exist for sediment moving {{in several different}} parts of the flow. These formulas are often segregated into bed load, suspended load, and wash load. They may sometimes also be segregated into bed material load and wash load.|$|E

50|$|Waves are {{constructive}} if {{the period}} between their wave crests is {{long enough for the}} breaking water to recede and the sediment to settle before the succeeding wave arrives and breaks. Fine <b>sediment</b> <b>transported</b> from lower down the beach profile will compact if the receding water percolates or soaks into the beach. Compacted sediment is more resistant to movement by turbulent water from succeeding waves.|$|R
30|$|As {{turbidity}} currents reach abyssal plains, {{a decrease}} in slope causes reduced velocity, allowing sediments to be deposited within lobes. Construction of the fan is primarily due to the deposition of <b>sediments</b> <b>transported</b> by turbidity currents (Naini and Kolla 1982; Kolla and Coumes 1984). The Indus Fan extends about 1500  km into the Arabian Sea and is up to 960  km wide (Naini and Kolla 1982; Kolla and Coumes 1984, 1987).|$|R
25|$|Flow in culverts, over dams, {{and around}} bridge piers can cause {{erosion of the}} bed.
