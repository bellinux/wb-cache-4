Intense background staining occurred with lipophilic stains, whose log P > 2.

Aggregation changes the fluorescence properties of JC- 1, shifting from green to red fluorescence. Intact mitochondrial membranes stained with JC- 1 exhibit a pronounced red mitochondrial fluorescence that is detectable by fluorescence microscopy. A breakdown of the mitochondrial membrane potential results in a subsequent decrease in green fluorescence and increase in red fluorescence. Prior to NPs stimulation, cells were washed with PBS twice and incubated with JC- 1 <b>staining</b> <b>reagent</b> (1 : 1000) in medium at 37  °C for 30  min, followed by washing with PBS and cell treatment.

It remains unclear whether innate stimuli can modify the profile of endogenous lipids recognized by iNKT cells on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). We report that activation of human APCs by Toll-like receptor ligands (TLR-L) modulates the lipid biosynthetic pathway, resulting in enhanced recognition of CD 1 d-associated lipids by iNKT cells, as defined by IFN-gamma secretion.
