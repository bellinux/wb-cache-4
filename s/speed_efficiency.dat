5|$|Tomb Raider III {{is built}} on an {{upgraded}} version of the Tomb Raider engine used by its predecessors. The engine offers better <b>speed</b> <b>efficiency</b> and new graphical features such as coloured lighting and triangular polygons, allowing developers to achieve greater detail and more complex geometry. The game {{was designed to be}} more in line with the puzzle-solving gameplay of the original Tomb Raider as opposed to the more shooting-oriented style of Tomb Raider II. The PlayStation served as the lead platform for the game, while the Microsoft Windows release is simply a better-looking conversion.|$|E
5|$|The {{upgraded}} engine offered better <b>speed</b> <b>efficiency</b> and new graphical features. While {{both the}} original Tomb Raider and Tomb Raider II used a grid system where developers could build the levels {{with a set}} of blocks, Tomb Raider IIIs system incorporated triangular polygons, allowing developers to achieve greater detail and more complex architectural structures. The triangles also allowed developers to implement the game's quicksand and rippling water features. The dynamic lighting system was improved with coloured lighting and better water reflection, making Tomb Raider III more atmospheric than its predecessors. The team also implemented new weather effects such as rain, snow, and wind. The game features more particle effects, offering more realistic explosions and smoke. All the textures used in the game were drawn in true colour before being rendered by the graphics engine, resulting in a better output quality.|$|E
2500|$|After her war service she {{underwent}} {{repair and}} refit prior to redelivery to the Grace Line. A post-war promotional brochure boasted, [...] "...The [...] {{have been completely}} redecorated, refurbished and modernized after their war service; and provided with up-to-the-minute equipment to insure comfort, <b>speed,</b> <b>efficiency</b> and safety. They have the very latest type of moving-picture equipment, a public address system, a fine orchestra and varied facilities for deck games. Thus equipped, these twin liners offer you the comfort of an attractively furnished country home together with the diversions of your favorite club." [...] She resumed service on 2 May 1947 and now sailed from New York for the Caribbean and {{the east coast of}} South America. In 1958 [...] Santa Paula was replaced by a larger Gibbs-designed liner of the same name. The older ship was laid up at Hoboken, NJ until 1961 when both she and her sister ship Santa Rosa were sold to Greek owners.|$|E

50|$|Hungarian high milling used a hard or {{tenacious}} {{variety of}} Hungarian wheat.

50|$|Many {{airlines}} subcontract {{ground handling}} to an airport or a handling agent, {{or even to}} another airline. Ground handling addresses the many service requirements of a passenger aircraft between the time it arrives at a terminal gate and the time it departs for its next flight. <b>Speed,</b> <b>efficiency,</b> and accuracy are important in ground handling services {{in order to minimize}} the turnaround time (the time during which the aircraft remains parked at the gate).|$|E
5000|$|... "Stand-up time" [...] is {{the amount}} of time a newly {{excavated}} cavity can support itself without any added structures. Knowing this parameter allows the engineers to determine how far an excavation can proceed before support is needed, which in turn affects the <b>speed,</b> <b>efficiency,</b> and cost of construction. Generally, certain configurations of rock and clay will have the greatest stand-up time, while sand and fine soils will have a much lower stand-up time.|$|E

5000|$|During the project, Levitt & Sons {{emphasized}} <b>speed,</b> <b>efficiency,</b> {{and cost-effective}} construction; these methods {{led to a}} production rate of 30 houses a day by July 1948. The mass production of thousands of houses at virtually the same time allowed the company to sell them {{for as little as}} $8,000 each ($65,000 in 2009 dollars), which, with the G.I. Bill and Federal housing subsidies, reduced the up-front cost of a house to many buyers to around $400.|$|E
50|$|Compared {{to other}} {{civilian}} ("commercial") open-cockpit biplanes of the era, Travel Airs were noted for {{their quality of}} construction, reliability, durability, <b>speed,</b> <b>efficiency,</b> payload and passenger capacity (two passengers in a small bench seat in the front cockpit, plus pilot in the rear cockpitâ€”versus most biplanes of the era, which could only accommodate a single passenger in the front cockpit). They were also noted for superior comfort and easy flying. These various distinguishing characteristics led Travel Air to outsell all rivals by 1929.|$|E
30|$|Legged {{locomotion}} modes, such as running, climbing, and paddling, bring remarkable multi-terrain adaptivity to animals. However, wheeled {{motion is}} superior to legged one in <b>speed</b> and energetic <b>efficiency.</b> The best way to acquire multi-terrain adaptivity, <b>speed,</b> and energetic <b>efficiency</b> for an mobile robot is finding a method to integrate legged motion into wheeled locomotion.|$|R
30|$|To {{improve the}} solving <b>speed</b> and <b>efficiency,</b> an explicitâ€“explicit order {{solution}} method is put forward based on {{analysis of the}} features of implicit and explicit algorithm. Results show that the explicitâ€“explicit order solution method has faster operation <b>speed</b> and higher <b>efficiency</b> than the implicitâ€“explicit order solution method while the accuracy of the calculations are almost the same. Hence, the explicitâ€“explicit order solution method is more suitable for solving the wheel/rail rolling contact problem with large scale.|$|R

50|$|Nowadays, {{the growing}} pace of {{innovations}} in electronics drives to new solutions for energy and information transfer to enhance its <b>speed,</b> <b>efficiency</b> and reliability.

But the wires in all digital systems still remain analog. Digital wire becomes indispensable for providing efficient, robust, adaptable, and cost effective energy supply. Presently, no one knows, however, how {{it is supposed to}} work or what technology would be able to create such a device.|$|E
