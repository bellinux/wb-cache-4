Staind's 2003 album 14 Shades Of Grey does not express as much anger as the band's previous albums and shows the band's departure from heavy metal elements and a movement towards a lighter sound. Papa Roach abandoned the nu metal genre with their 2004 album Getting Away with Murder, moving to a hard rock style.|$|R

Care should be taken at any time of the year, especially on the hillier regions between Mossburn and Milford Sound. Flooding can also occur at any time along the road especially around rivers.|$|E
50|$|The snare drum {{seems to}} have descended from a medieval drum called the tabor, which was a drum with a single-gut snare strung across the bottom. It is a little bigger than a medium tom and was first used in war, often played with a fife (pipe); the player would play both the fife and drum (see also Pipe and tabor). Tabors were not always double-headed and not all may have had snares. By the 15th century, {{the size of the}} snare drum had {{increased}} and had a cylindrical shape. This simple drum with a simple snare became popular with the Swiss mercenary troops who used the fife and drum from the 15th to 16th centuries. The drum was made deeper and carried {{along the side of the}} body. Further developments appeared in the 17th century, with the use of screws to hold down the snares, giving a brighter sound than the rattle of a loose snare. During the 18th century, the snare drum underwent changes which improved its characteristic <b>sound.</b> <b>Metal</b> snares appeared in the 20th century. Today the snare drum is used in jazz, pop music and modern orchestral music.|$|E

5000|$|A simple {{vertical}} crack with {{a freshly}} fractured surface and old rust {{marks on the}} face was easily distinguished {{to the side of}} the centre joint, extending from the bottom flange to the top of the girder. This was associated with a casting defect hidden behind a surface skin of <b>sound</b> <b>metal</b> at the thickest part of the section where the flanges met the web. This was described by the accident report as a large honeycomb, or drawhole, which measured 3½ ins (c 90 mm) across at the face, and narrowed to about l½ ins (c 40 mm). inside , 2⅜ ins (c 60 mm) in extreme depth and 6ins (c 150 mm). in extreme length, extending inwards and downwards ...but not within 1 ½ ins of the outer face of the joint flange. The total capacity of the hole, measured by filling it with water, was 15 ½ cubic inches (about 250 ml) and, as the metal immediately round the hole was not sound, this amount does not measure the actual extent of the flaw. [...] There were other signs of poor foundry practice when the girder had been cast; honeycombing elsewhere, a cold shut (incomplete fusion between different streams of filling metal), and residual stresses in the girder web (as a consequence of which, when sample cores were being drilled for testing, the web (but not the flanges) fractured along the line of holes. Whilst the metal appeared to be of good quality to the naked eye, the tested tensile strength of the metal varied widely from the lowest of ~4.5 tsi (c 70 MPa) (close to the honeycombing) with a mean of 7.5 tsi (c 115 MPa).The accident report says that the girder if sound would have had a breaking strength of 80 tons and concludes that the theoretical strength of the girder was ‘above but only just above’ the Board of Trade requirement (live load x 6 + dead load x 3) (However this appears inconsistent with the figures quoted by the report for dead weight (21 ton shared between 2 girders) and live load (21 ton shared between two girders))The actual strength fell below this because of the casting defect; [...] "The sectional area of the bottom flange would at one place be reduced from 36 (sq) ins to only 28 (sq) ins, thus enormously reducing the strength of the girder" ...|$|E

To avoid the interferer from plasma arc light, the spectrum of plasma arc was measured and analyzed, and a narrow band filter system was designed. The images of molten pool were analyzed, and a fuzzy-PID controller was used to control the molten pool size. Experimental results prove that using this system can improve parts surface quality...|$|E

40|$|Ethical {{considerations}} {{can limit}} {{the use of}} traditional unconditional stimuli (US), such as electric shock and loud tones, when used in a human aversive Pavlovian conditioning procedure. The risk of the US causing pain or excessive anxiety is a particular concern when testing sensitive populations such as children, the elderly, and those with psychological or neurodevelopmental disorders. Two experiments used a differential conditioning procedure to determine whether an unpleasant <b>sound</b> (<b>metal</b> scraping on slate) could support the acquisition and extinction of conditioned responses {{to the same extent}} as either electric shock or a 100 dB(A) tone US. Experiment 1 (N = 48) demonstrated equivalent or superior conditioning effects for the signal-based learning measures of US expectancy, skin conductance responses, and heart rate.

The results support the use of an unpleasant sound as a US in human Pavlovian conditioning experiments. Griffith Health, School of Applied PsychologyFull Tex...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{excavations}} in Tepe Sagzabad in Qazvin Plain, Iran, yielded some archaeological metal artifacts {{dating to}} the Early Iron Age. Among different metal fragments, a small tube was found. As a part of systematic analytical research, thin sheet tube was studied for elemental composition, manufacturing technique and deterioration mechanism using optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and Raman spectroscopy. The results of analyses showed that the tube has been made from a thin sheet Cu-Sn alloy. In addition, {{it was found that}} the tube was completely mineralized, and there was no <b>sound</b> <b>metal</b> remained in it. Corrosion of the tube was composed of a bilayer structure in which the original shape of the artifact has been preserved. Raman characterization of the corrosion products showed that the inner layer is composed mainly of cupric oxide (tenorite) beneath an outer cuprous oxide layer (cuprite) which has grown outward from the original surface. This is believed to be due to a corrosion phenomenon of bronze alloys known as "decuprification process". Moreover, microscopic investigation showed presence of elongated inclusions merely in the inner layer indicating both the manufacturing process and the limit of the original surface of the tube...|$|E
40|$|A new {{and simple}} method for the {{production}} of metal matrix composite by friction stir processing (FSP) sandwiches made from metal sheets (e. g. Mg- or Al-based alloy) intercalated with a reinforcing material e. g. a carbon fabric has recently been devised by the present authors [A. Mertens et al., Mater. Charact. 107 (2015), 125 - 133]. This process allowed the production of large-size <b>sound</b> <b>metal</b> matrix composites, but the usage properties (e. g. wear resistance, [...] .) of these composites are not yet optimised. Indeed, the matrix of the composite may be softened after processing as FSP is known to cause dissolution of the precipitates responsible for strengthening Mg- or Al-based alloys [A. Simar et al., Mater. Sci. Eng. A 486 (2008), 85 - 95]. This work thus aims at investigating the potential of thermal treatments for tailoring the microstructure and wear behaviour of age hardenable aluminium alloy 6005 – C fibres composites. The effect of (solution and) ageing treatments on the microstructure and hardness of FSPed Al-C composites has been investigated using optical and scanning electron microscopy, along with Vickers hardness tests. The wear behaviour of the as-FSPed and of the heat treated specimens has been characterized using a pin-on-disc tribometer. Moreover, reference AA 6005 samples without C fibres have been produced and tested under similar conditions. The comparison of the reference and of the composite samples allows {{a better understanding of the}} role of the C fibres in controlling the grain size of the Al matrix by influencing recrystallisation during FSP and grain growth during thermal treatments...|$|E
