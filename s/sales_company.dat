5|$|GM {{assembly}} plants were operated in New Zealand from 1926 until 1990 by General Motors New Zealand Limited {{in an earlier}} and quite separate operation from Holden's in Australia. Although Holden's involvement in exports has fluctuated since the 1950s, the declining sales of large cars in Australia led the company to look to international markets to increase profitability. Since 2010 Holden has incurred losses due to the strong Australian dollar, and government grants have been reduced. This led to the announcement on 11 December 2013 that Holden will cease vehicle and engine production {{by the end of}} 2017, however, the company will continue to have a large and ongoing presence in Australia importing and selling cars as national <b>sales</b> <b>company.</b> Holden will retain their design centre, but with reduced staffing.|$|E

25|$|In New Zealand, GM was {{represented}} by locally assembled Chevrolet, Pontiac and Vauxhall cars from 1926. In 1954 sales of fully imported Holdens began. New Zealand assembly of Holdens begun in 1957 was slowly phased in through the early 1960s to replace most Vauxhall and all Chevrolet cars. Thirty years later, Australia tariff protection was removed and local assembly plants closed in 1984 and 1990. GM became a national <b>sales</b> <b>company</b> and a parts distribution centre. In the early 1990s General Motors New Zealand sold a few Isuzu and Opel models rebranded as Holdens while GM New Zealand was renamed Holden in 1994.|$|E

25|$|In {{keeping with}} Brooks' own tradition, each ticket sold {{for the tour}} is the same price, {{regardless}} of location in the venue. An issue that arose beginning with the first concerts on the tour has been high ticket resale prices. For example, tickets for the seven-show residency in Dallas were being resold online for an average price 21% higher than face value. Because of Ticketmaster's anti-resale policies, Brooks chose the company to be the official ticket <b>sales</b> <b>company</b> for the tour. Despite the optimism {{for a lack of}} extreme resale prices, Ticketmaster's partner resale sites and services began allowing individuals to sell marked up tickets anyway. In the first weeks of the tour, Atlanta tickets were posted for sale on TicketsNow for as much as nearly 470% higher than face value (i.e. a $71.50 ticket being sold for $405). Brooks, a long-time proponent of banning increased price ticket resales, called out those marking up ticket prices, saying his ultimate goal is making concerts affordable regardless of seat location.|$|E

500|$|In May 2006, Russia banned {{imports of}} the Georgian mineral waters, declaring them unsafe. The ban got lifted after 7 years in 2013.

500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 975 feet long, {{was released}} on September 6, 1910. [...] The film was distributed by the Motion Picture Distributing and <b>Sales</b> <b>Company.</b> Once the film was released, it was sometimes listed ambiguously for other productions bearing the same name. One ambiguous listing, most likely for the Thanhouser film, {{was made by the}} Crystal Theatre in Hutchinson, Kansas. Known theaters advertising the film, unambiguously, are noted in Indiana and Arizona. A reviewer of The Moving Picture World wrote, [...] " [...] little domestic tragedy which shows how boys are sometimes driven from home and what results from it. ... It is a picture that goes direct to the heart and makes one put himself in the place of all the characters. Perhaps that magic word, mother, {{is the key to the}} whole situation." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror took issue with the depiction of the step father's violent abuse of the young son and found the melodrama to be one [...] "with an ending that appeals to the sympathies".|$|E
