The population is spread in areas far from the city center, with no access to drinking water distributionnetwork. They have water wells equipped with human motorized pump, which often not sufficient {{to comply with the}} population needsand uses. The Sparouine village, with around 800 people, was chosen by the municipality to implement a proper drinking watersupply. According to water consumption, the production should aim minimum 200 m 3 per day. The region is essentially composed of metamorphic <b>staurotide</b> micashist rocks. Dolerite dykes with kilometric scale and quartz veinsintrude also the area. A geophysical prospection with tomography was conducted to implement four prospection cored boreholes. This work has revealed an important structure which cuts three electrical panels,first considered as a dolerite dyke and with noinformation on its draining properties. A cored drilling borehole was then completed to study the geology and aquifer potential of this structure. Finally, the results revealedan important weathering profile at this place, probably due to a deep corridor faults. More than 40 m of clay was first crossed and then 30 m of altered schist, before targeting the fissured hard rock. The cores obtained allowed to see a big density of cracks, veryweathered, showing an important water circulation. Furthermore, no trace of oxidation was found and the presence of calco-pyriteproved that such weathering can appear in reducing environment. Whereas most of the water wells in the West of French Guiana have a production flow around 4 m 3 /h, {{it is likely that the}} future well ofSparouine could reveal a flow rate over 10 m 3 /h, which could enable to reach the production target with one well only. Thus thisexample enlightens the importance of underground water and hydrogeology contribution for drinking water access and developmentfor isolated places...|$|E

Abstract. - The Mossbauer {{spectra of}} tourmaline and staurolite presents {{at room temperature}} two doublets of Fez+. The inner doublet is less intense and increases with temperature and by irradiation with 2 MeV electrons. This doublet vanishes reversibly at low temperatures (below 77 K). This behaviour has been interpreted as due to an electron exchange between Fez+ and the vacancy. The tourmaline mineral is a silicate {{which can be found}} with different chemical composition whose general formula is NaR,Al,B,Si,O,(OH, F), [I]. As indicate by X-ray structural studies, in this complex crystal structure there are two distorted octahedral sites: the first contains Mg or Mn which form trigonal planes perpendicular to cc c)) axes; the second site is occupied by A 13 '. In both sites the octahedral coordi-nation is made by four 0 - and two OH- groups [2] resulting in cis and trans forms. The Fez + is a substi-tutional impurity in these systems and can in principle be found in both octahedral sites. Strong pleochroic bands at about 14 000 cm-I are present in the optical spectra of tourmaline as well as in others silicates (vivianite, biotite, olivine, etc.), which have been attributed to electron charge transfer between iron ions [3]. The staurolite mineral has a crystal structure cha-racteristic of a monoclinic spacial group and the accepted chemical formula is HzFe,AI,,Si, 04,. The iron ions (Fez +) are tetrahedrally coordinated to four oxygens while the A 13 + ions occupy three non equiva-lent octahedral sites 141. Extensive studies by Mossbauer spectroscopy have been performed in both tourmaline and staurolite, and it has been difficult to interpret the spectra in terms of the available structural information [5, 6...|$|E
40|$|En utilisant les données de P.  DEMANGEON (1959), les {{connaissances}} acquises sur le métamorphisme de la Montagne Noire et nos propres résultats, ce travail met en évidence les variations des spectres minéralogiques dans la sédimentation néogène du piémont languedocien avant de les expliquer par l'érosion et la tectonique. Les rapports entre les aplanissements et les accumulations sédimentaires sont analysés. La sédimentation fine du bassin de Cruzy-Montouliers témoigne d'une morphogenèse calme favorable au façonnement d'un vaste aplanissement miocène bien conservé à Villespassans. La crise messinienne et un soulèvement du socle accompagné de déformations souples, à la charnière mio-pliocène, expliquent l'arrivée massive de <b>staurotide</b> dans la sédimentation du piémont. A half-century {{after the}} P.  DEMANGEON thesis (1959) and despite numerous researches concerning the southern Central Massif, {{there are no}} certitudes about the chronology of the erosion surfaces and the uplift stages of the Massif Central. The use of P.  DEMANGEON data, advances in the Montagne Noire metamorphism (M.  DEMANGE, 1998) and our own results allows us to record mineralogical variations in the Neogene Languedocian piedmont (Tab.  I, Fig.   3), then to explain them by erosion and tectonics in the Orb basin. A north-south cross-section in the Saint-Chinianais is used to analyse relationships between erosion surfaces and piedmont deposits (Fig.   1, 4, 5). A sharp change in the heavy minerals composition occurs between Miocene and Pliocene: tourmaline which dominated during the Miocene is replaced by staurolite during the Pliocene (Fig.   3). The figure  2 shows that this massive arrival of staurolite takes place when erosion reaches the X  14 and X  15 micaschists which are thrusted by the Cambro-Ordovician Avant-Monts. The fine sedimentation in the Cruzy-Montouliers basin shows that a low morphogenesis occurred from the Burdigalian to the Tortonian and was favourable to the elaboration of the Villespassans erosion surface. The Messinian regression of the Mediterranean Sea caused a deep valley incision up to Cessenon for the Orb River and to Montouliers for the Cesse tributary. However, an uplift of the basement with gentle distortions in the Languedocian piedmont seems necessary to explain the upstream erosion in the X micaschists. The Villespassans surface was distorted while the lower Fontcaude surface was not affected. These Mio-Pliocene tectonic movements are responsible of the size increase and of the mineralogical change in the Pliocene deposits...|$|E
