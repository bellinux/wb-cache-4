A definitive version was subsequently published in Clinical Neurophysiology, 2011 Vol. 122 Issue 2, pp. 267 - 77 DOI: [URL] The present study examined the benefit of rapid alternation of EEG and fMRI (a common strategy for avoiding artifact caused by rapid switching of MRI gradients) for detecting experimental modulations of ERPs in combined EEG–fMRI. The study also assessed the advantages of aiding the extraction of <b>specific</b> ERP <b>components</b> by <b>means</b> of signal decomposition using Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Methods ‘Go–nogo’ task stimuli were presented either during fMRI scanning or in the gaps between fMRI scans, resulting in ‘gradient’ and ‘no-gradient’ ERPs. ‘Go–nogo’ differences in the N 2 and P 3 components were subjected to conventional ERP analysis, as well as single-trial and reliability analyses. Results Comparable N 2 and P 3 enhancement on ‘nogo’ trials was found in the ‘gradient’ and ‘no-gradient’ ERPs. ICA-based signal decomposition resulted in better validity (as indicated by topography), greater stability and lower measurement error of the predicted ERP effects. Conclusions While there was little or no benefit of acquiring ERPs in the gaps between fMRI scans, ICA decomposition did improve the detection of experimental ERP modulations. Significance Simultaneous and continuous EEG–fMRI acquisition is preferable to interleaved protocols. ICA-based decomposition is useful not only for artifact cancellation, but also for the extraction of <b>specific</b> ERP <b>components...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a masked system, {{which consists of}} several components. Due to cost and diagnostic constraints, the <b>component</b> <b>mean</b> lifetimes might not be exactly known. We {{consider a}} system where if one of components fails, the whole system fails and suppose that the lifetimes of components have exponential distributions. Since the exponential distribution has a large variance, {{it is hard to}} find the <b>component</b> <b>mean</b> lifetimes. We propose an estimation method, which will generally find the <b>component</b> <b>mean</b> lifetimes. The results of a Monte Carlo simulation study are presented to demonstrate the favorable estimation of the <b>mean</b> lifetimes of <b>components</b> using unclassified system life data. The estimation produced by our method is better than that produced by the K-means algorithm. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Aim. To {{determine}} if the validated Sexual Function Questionnaire (SFQ), developed to assess efficacy in female sexual dysfunction (FSD) clinical trials, may also have utility in identifying target populations for such studies. Methods. Data from five clinical trials and two general population surveys were {{used to analyze the}} utility of the SFQ as a tool to discriminate between the presence of <b>specific</b> <b>components</b> of FSD (i. e., hypoactive sexual desire disorder, female sexual arousal disorder, female orgasmic disorder, and dyspareunia).

A set-up time is required before each batch of standard components is processed. A job is completed when both its standard and <b>specific</b> <b>components</b> have been processed and are available.

We present results for two well-known due-date related criteria. In particular, an O(n 2) dynamic programming algorithm is derived for the problem of minimising the maximum lateness. For minimising the number of late jobs, we show {{that the problem is}} NP-hard and give a dynamic programming algorithm that requires pseudo-polynomial time. Finally, we show that a variant of the number of late jobs problem, {{in which there is a}} common processing time for the standard components, is solvable in O(n 4 log n) time...|$|R
