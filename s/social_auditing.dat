40|$|This article explores issues {{associated}} with organisational governance {{in the context of}} stakeholder engagement. It argues that both public relations (PR) research and practice have yet to address systematically the challenges inherent in this area, particularly how organisations exert power over stakeholders. Prompted by a consideration of the situational theory of power put forward by the sociologist Steven Lukes, it introduces the concept of passive aggression to PR practice. This is cited {{as an example of a}} wider phenomenon, which the author calls dark dialogue. The insights generated by these perspectives are used to highlight how theoretical approaches in the PR field that seek to understand and promote the role of dialogue in organisational-stakeholder relations face an empirical challenge. This insight is then used to highlight the limitations of what has been traditionally termed as <b>social</b> <b>auditing.</b> It is suggested that PR and <b>social</b> <b>auditing</b> practice share the same blind spots when it comes to assessing how organisations exercise power and behave towards their stakeholders. The article goes on to advocate collaboration between PR professionals and academics to practically address these issues through a reconfigured <b>social</b> <b>auditing</b> process.

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>audit</b> is one {{of those}} {{important}} mechanisms for strengthening NGOs’ accountability to poor communities (as NGOs’ key beneficiaries). However, conducting <b>social</b> <b>audits</b> within the NGO sector often rests on the individual interests and priorities of donors or NGOs themselves, effectively resulting in self-selection bias, and limiting the effectiveness and usefulness of <b>social</b> <b>audits</b> as a control and evaluation mechanism. The purpose of this chapter is to identify the prevalence, scale, and scope of <b>social</b> <b>audits</b> within the NGO sector, particularly NGOs engaging in microenterprise development programs. Accordingly, this study examined 20 NGOs operating in two countries - Bangladesh and Indonesia. Data were collected from publicly available sources and in-depth interviews with senior executives of the participating NGOs. Further, 10 interviews were conducted with a small sample of beneficiaries (individuals or groups from four of the participating NGOs) in order to gain an understanding of beneficiaries’ perceptions of the NGOs’ <b>social</b> <b>audit</b> mechanism. The findings reveal a range of approaches to <b>social</b> <b>audit</b> among NGOs, as well as the usefulness and limitations of this mechanism for strengthening NGO accountability, particularly to beneficiaries. Findings highlight that within the NGOs investigated the conduct of <b>social</b> <b>audits</b> remained voluntary and was strongly dependant on donors’ requirements.

40|$|A {{participatory}} approach to codes of labour practice {{comes from a}} different perspective to more compliance focused snapshot <b>social</b> <b>auditing.</b> It puts greater emphasis on involvement of workers and workers organisations in the process of code implementation and assessment. It is based on developing partnerships between different actors (companies, trade unions, NGOs and preferably government) in developing a locally sustainable approach to the improvement of working conditions. This approach is sensitive to uncovering and thus addressing more complex issues such as gender discrimination and sexual harassment. These are issues more likely to be experienced by insecure non-permanent workers, who are often women, whose voices snapshot audits usually fail to pick up. They are less visible issues, that are unlikely to be resolved through a simple compliance approach. The goal of a {{participatory approach}} is a process of awareness creation and improvement that is more gender sensitive. A participatory approach can be developed at different levels. At a minimum it involves the use of participatory tools in the process of <b>social</b> <b>auditing</b> to ensure that the views and voices of workers, especially women workers, are captured in an audit. More genuine participation by workers also requires the involvement of workers representatives or shop stewards at site level, and sector trade unions and NGOs, both in awareness creation and auditing process. At its broadest level, it involves the development of local multi-stakeholder initiatives that bring companies, trade unions and NGOs together with government in forming an independent body able to oversee the implementation, and monitoring of a locally relevant code of labour practice. Such an approach faces many challenges, but it represents a shift away from a formal top down compliance orientation, to the greater empowerment of workers and their representative organisations as {{an essential part of the}} process of improving labour standards and working conditions.

40|$|Abstract Health {{planners}} and managers {{make decisions based}} on their appreciation of causality. <b>Social</b> <b>audits</b> question the assumptions behind this and try to improve quality of available evidence. The method has its origin in the follow-up of Bhopal survivors in the 1980 s, where “cluster cohorts” tracked health events over time. In <b>social</b> <b>audit,</b> a representative panel of sentinel sites are the framework to follow the impact of health programmes or reforms. The epidemiological backbone of <b>social</b> <b>audit</b> tackles causality in a calculated way, balancing computational aspects with appreciation of the limits of the science. <b>Social</b> <b>audits</b> share findings with planners at policy level, health services providers, and users in the household, where final decisions about use of public services rest. Sharing survey results with sample communities and service workers generates a second order of results through structured discussions. Aggregation of these evidence-based community-led solutions across a representative sample provides a rich substrate for decisions. This socialising of evidence for participatory action (SEPA) involves a different skill set but quality control and rigour are still important. Early <b>social</b> <b>audits</b> addressed settings without accepted sample frames, the fundamentals of reproducible questionnaires, and the logistics of data turnaround. Feedback of results to stakeholders was at CIET insistence – and at CIET expense. Later <b>social</b> <b>audits</b> included strong SEPA components. Recent and current <b>social</b> <b>audits</b> are institutionalising high level research methods in planning, incorporating randomisation and experimental designs in a rigorous approach to causality. The 25 years have provided a number of lessons. <b>Social</b> <b>audit</b> reduces the arbitrariness of planning decisions, and reduces the wastage of simply allocating resources the way they were in past years. But too much evidence easily exceeds the uptake capacity of decision takers. Political will of governments often did not match those of donors with interest conditioned by political cycles. Some reforms have a longer turnaround than the political cycle; short turnaround interventions can develop momentum.

40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>Audits</b> play an {{important}} role in the measurement and analysis of a company's social performance. They provide corporations with a tool to plan and manage their social responsibility activities.

Whilst the topic of <b>social</b> <b>audits</b> has been raised and discussed by a number of scholars, industry representatives and government institutions over the years, such contributions have mostly revolved around the general notion and importance of <b>social</b> <b>audit,</b> rather than addressing the most effective ways to achieve a widespread and reliable adoption of the practice through the implementation of specific legal regulation and other methods.

40|$|Purpose - The {{main purpose}} {{in this article}} is to {{highlight}} civil society activism that resulted in the inception of environmental auditing in the United States in the 1970 s. The General Motors (GM) campaign which is discussed in this article led towards major institutional changes for the implementation of corporate social responsibility (environmental) reporting originally referred to as social (environmental) auditing. The Securities and Exchange Commission&# 039;s (SEC) role and actions are analysed in detail in order to highlight the direction of this Federal Agency in relation to the implementation of social (environmental) auditing. Design/methodology/approach - A detailed analysis of literature from the early 1970 s is undertaken in order to identify the inception of environmental auditing and the types of environmental auditing as <b>social</b> <b>auditing</b> in its early stages. The case of the GM campaign is analysed in order to highlight the forms of historical institutionalism relevant to the critical stage of exogenous influences on companies to undertake social (environmental) auditing. Findings - It is found that in the early 1970 s companies resisted the incorporation of corporate social responsibility initiatives and actions as part of their agendas. Environmental Auditing as a type of <b>social</b> <b>auditing</b> at that time referred to corporate social responsibility disclosures that included environmental disclosures. Due to public pressure and civil society activism companies had to adopt and undertake social (environmental) auditing.

In Ukraine the implementation of the system of social audit is in its initial phase. Some measures for implementation of the system of social audit were introduced in Ukraine.
