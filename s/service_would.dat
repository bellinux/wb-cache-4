5|$|Whilst the Campaign for Borders Rail {{acknowledged}} that the half-hourly weekday stopping <b>service</b> <b>would</b> be useful for commuters, it questions whether {{this is the best}} use of a line, which could carry other types of traffic. The organisation had proposed a two-tier service, whereby both a half-hourly stopping train and an hourly limited express <b>service</b> <b>would</b> continue north of Gorebridge.|$|E
5|$|A {{branch of}} the IND Culver Line running via Tenth Avenue and Fort Hamilton Parkway to 86th Street, with a {{connection}} to the BMT West End Line. West End <b>service</b> <b>would</b> run via the Culver Line and would alleviate congestion at DeKalb Avenue Junction.

50|$|Until June 2015, V/Line Geelong and Warrnambool line {{services}} stopped at Werribee. The Melbourne bound <b>services</b> <b>would</b> use Platform 2, while Geelong bound <b>services</b> <b>would</b> use Platform 3. These services now operate via the Regional Rail Link.|$|R
25|$|In November 2016, Alliance Rail {{announced}} {{plans to use the}} 442s on a new intercity express <b>service</b> which <b>would</b> operate on the South West Main Line between London Waterloo and Southampton Central.

5000|$|Since at {{this point}} in history most of the growth on the Internet was coming from non-military sources, it was decided that the Department of Defense would no longer fund {{registration}} services outside of the [...]mil TLD. In 1993 the U.S. National Science Foundation, after a competitive bidding process in 1992, created the InterNIC to manage the allocations of addresses and management of the address databases, and awarded the contract to three organizations. Registration <b>Services</b> <b>would</b> be provided by Network Solutions; Directory and Database <b>Services</b> <b>would</b> be provided by AT&T; and Information <b>Services</b> <b>would</b> be provided by General Atomics.|$|R

5|$|Hogg {{gained the}} {{position}} of revising barrister for Northumberland and Berwick in 1838. This required him to travel to Northern England twice a year. Jane often complained about these trips, but Hogg enjoyed visiting the north. He hoped that his legal <b>service</b> <b>would</b> earn him an appointment as a judge, but {{he was to be}} disappointed.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Mayor Benjamin F.

5|$|After World War II, and {{following}} considerable controversy, the City of Philadelphia {{agreed that it}} would transfer custody of the bell and Independence Hall, while retaining ownership, to the federal government. The city would also transfer various colonial-era buildings it owned. Congress agreed to the transfer in 1948, and three years later Independence National Historical Park was founded, incorporating those properties and administered by the National Park Service (NPS or Park Service). The Park <b>Service</b> <b>would</b> be responsible for maintaining and displaying the bell. The NPS would also administer the three blocks just north of Independence Hall, which had been condemned by the state, razed, and developed into a park, Independence Mall.|$|E

The official dedication for the $3.2 million facility occurred on August 12, 2006, with Governor Jim Doyle, U.S. Representative Paul Ryan and Racine County Executive Bill McReynolds in attendance. <b>Service</b> <b>would</b> be discontinued at the 1901-depot the following day with the new facility opening for passenger service on August 14, 2006.

5|$|Alternate plans {{included}} constructing {{two sets}} of two tubes, one for commuter and freight service from the LIRR {{and the other for}} rapid transit, or two tunnels each with individual tubes for freight and subway service. The freight <b>service</b> <b>would</b> have occurred during off-peak hours only, but simultaneous with subway service, with passenger trains running in 30-minute or one-hour headways during these times. A 1912 proposal had freight running at night between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m., while the 1925 plans called for joint freight and passenger service during early mornings (5 a.m. to 6 a.m.), middays (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.), and overnights (8 p.m. to 5 a.m.).|$|E

The local passenger rail advocacy group, All Aboard Erie, proposed a feasibility study in 2014 for high-speed rail service to connect to the corridors at Cleveland and Buffalo. The group also sought to determine if rail <b>service</b> <b>would</b> be possible using the existing tracks and right of way between Erie, Youngstown and Pittsburgh.|$|E

5|$|In June 1968, an {{agreement}} was reached where the state Transportation Assistance Authority would pay $2 million and Penn Central would pay $2.5 million for the 11 Metroliners for Harrisburg service. On July 14, a 4-car train was tested on the line, with several demonstration runs for officials on August 21. In early October, several test trains proved {{the viability of the}} planned sub-3-hour schedules. Substation modifications later that month and a legal settlement between Budd and Penn Central in November paved the way for service to begin. On December 20, Penn Central announced that Metroliner <b>service</b> <b>would</b> begin on January 16, 1969.|$|E
5|$|In November 1912, a {{bill was}} publicised under the LER name that {{included}} a plan to extend the Piccadilly tube tracks westwards from Hammersmith to connect to the L's Richmond branch tracks. The District line already ran trains over this route, and the Piccadilly tube <b>service</b> <b>would</b> provide additional connections. The bill received assent as the London Electric Railway Act, 1913 on 15 August 1913. The advent of World War I prevented work on the extension starting. Post-war, a shortage of funds and other priorities meant that the extension was postponed until the early 1930s.|$|E
