25|$|The {{international}} break left Middlesbrough without Tuncay and Shawky after both {{picked up}} injuries, while David Wheater could only make the bench after suffering from tonsillitis, so Digard, Riggott and Mido came in. Nathan Porritt was named {{as a substitute}} {{for the first time on}} an all-Academy bench. Portsmouth were the more dominant side throughout the match, however it was Boro who took the lead after Mido's fourth goal of the season. Jermain Defoe scored a brace for the home side in the second half to give them a 2–1 win. Digard picked up an injury and had to be taken off while Boro thought they <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> penalty after Downing was brought down in the box.|$|E
25|$|On 21 November 1492, off {{the coast}} of Cuba, Pinzón failed to follow a direct order of Columbus to change course. He {{probably}} sailed off on his own trying to make individual discoveries and to find treasure, although Cesáreo Fernández Duro argues that the initial separation may have been accidental, a matter of missed signals. (Asensio takes Fernández Duro strongly to task for not adequately explaining the length of the separation; Fernández Duro responds that Pinzón simply continued the prior course, and if Columbus wanted, he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> pretty fair idea where to find him over the next several days.) During his separate travels he discovered new land; while all of the island geography of the first voyage is open to question, it is believed that the land was Haiti.|$|E
25|$|The {{geographic}} {{panorama of}} the {{developments of the}} new biology was conditioned above all by preceding work. The US, where genetics had developed the most rapidly, and the UK, {{where there was a}} coexistence of both genetics and biochemical research of highly advanced levels, were in the avant-garde. Germany, the cradle of the revolutions in physics, with the best minds and the most advanced laboratories of genetics in the world, <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> primary {{role in the development of}} molecular biology. But history decided differently: the arrival of the Nazis in 1933 - and, to a less extreme degree, the rigidification of totalitarian measures in fascist Italy - caused the emigration of a large number of Jewish and non-Jewish scientists. The majority of them fled to the US or the UK, providing an extra impulse to the scientific dynamism of those nations. These movements ultimately made molecular biology a truly international science from the very beginnings.|$|E

In more fortunate circumstances the senior players could have eased the newcomers into the team, but Ray Illingworth was a captain who exploited every weakness and they did not get the chance. Their cause was not helped by the selectors Sir Donald Bradman, Sam Loxton and Neil Harvey who chose nineteen different players in the series, nine of them debutants, and continuously chopped and changed the team which did not allow it to settle.|$|E
25|$|A rare lunchtime {{kick-off}} was {{the scene}} of Napoli's visit to the Tardini, just the second home game the Crociati had had in a run of seven. Napoli had won four in a row before this game, but they were dominated by an impressive Parma performance. Gianluca Musacci, however, appear to have tripped Edison Cavani in the penalty area late on in the second half, although replays suggested that Cavani tripped over his feet. He picked himself up to take the penalty, had it saved by Mirante, but was quickest to react to poke it home to give Napoli the lead. The parallels with last week's penalty against Genoa were strong: the referee's decision was questionable and Mirante saved, but could only push it into the taker's path. Parma continued to dominate in the second half and <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> penalty for an Andrea Dossena handball, but eventually scored through Cristian Zaccardo's tap-in with not long left to go. As Parma pressed for the winner, Napoli broke and Ezequiel Lavezzi scored, although replays suggest he was offside.|$|E
25|$|Parma {{opened the}} last Serie A weekend of February away to Genoa, who {{were led by}} Pasquale Marino, the coach who took charge of much of Parma's 2010–11 season. With neither side having scored since 5 February, it was a {{surprise}} when the scoring was opened so easrly in the game; Massimo Gobbi swept home {{from the edge of the}} area after just five minutes. Giovinco then had what looked like a fair goal ruled out for offside just before half-time. Parma did get their second goal after the break after a brilliant run from Jonathan Biabiany ended in a Giovinco chance with the follow-up falling to Sergio Floccari, who converted against his former employees. With just over ten minutes to go, Genoa were very fortunate to be given a penalty for Francesco Modesto's accidental handball inside the area; Rodrigo Palacio tapped in after Mirante's save. Genoa then <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> penalty after a reckless Modesto challenged went unpunished. The referee inexplicably allowed 7 minutes of injury time; Palacio used the sixth to break the offside trap and slot home to level the score and earn a point for his team.|$|E

Anthony Montgomery (who played Ensign Travis Mayweather) was similarly displeased with the finale and said [...] "I feel there could have been a more effective way to wrap things up for our show as well as the franchise as a whole. It just seemed to take a little bit away from what the Enterprise cast and crew worked so diligently to achieve over the past four years." [...] While Frakes enjoyed working with Sirtis again, he said that [...] "the reality is {{it was a bit of}} a stretch to have us shut down [...] show," [...] and that in hindsight it was a disservice to them.

500|$|The {{critical}} {{recognition and}} renown of Astral Weeks came to overshadow Morrison's subsequent work, {{as well as}} Morrison himself. According to biographer Johnny Rogan, his recording career was [...] "all too often crystallized in a single moment. Like the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, Astral Weeks was perceived as a one-off whose critical standing allowed little discussion for other equally fascinating musical forays that followed." [...] Morrison felt annoyed by the retrospective acclaim and claims about the record's significance. In agreement with Logan's original criticism, he later said he should have [...] "changed the arrangements because the arrangements are too samey ... four or five other songs <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> change of mood." [...] Merenstein, on the other hand, still admires the album: [...] "To this day it gives me pain to hear it. Pain is the wrong word—I'm so moved by it." [...] In 2001, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, having shipped 500,000 copies in the US. Music historian Andrew Ford said the album's commercial performance, much like its musical aesthetic, is similar to classical music: [...] "Neither instant nor evanescent: Astral Weeks will sell as many copies this year {{as it did in}} 1968 and has every year in between".|$|E

Another mixed review was published in The Daily Telegraph, which described the film as a [...] "safe and emotionally generous crowd-pleaser" [...] that was not worthy of its Academy Award. Philip Kennicott wrote in The Washington Post that the film was [...] "as polished as it is heavy-handed", predictable yet ready to break taboos, immersed in death yet incapable of escaping [...] "the maddening Japanese taste for sentimentality". In Variety, Eddie Cockrell wrote that the film offered [...] "fascinating glimpses" [...] of the encoffining ceremony but <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> much shorter run time.

500|$|Despite Fischer's results against Taimanov and Larsen, his {{upcoming}} match against Petrosian seemed a daunting task. Nevertheless, the Soviet government {{was concerned about}} Fischer. [...] "Reporters asked Petrosian whether the match would last the full twelve games...

[...] Petrosian played a strong [...] in the first game, gaining the advantage, but Fischer eventually won the game after Petrosian faltered. This gave Fischer a run of 20 consecutive wins against the world's top players (in the Interzonal and Candidates matches), a winning streak topped only by Steinitz's 25 straight wins in 1873–1882. Petrosian won the second game, finally snapping Fischer's streak. After three consecutive draws, Fischer swept the next four games to win the match 6½–2½ (+5−1=3). Sports Illustrated ran {{an article on the}} match, highlighting Fischer's domination of Petrosian as being due to Petrosian's outdated system of preparation:Fischer's recent record raises the distinct possibility that he has made a breakthrough in modern chess theory. His response to Petrosian's elaborately plotted 11th move in the first game is an example: Russian experts had worked on the variation for weeks, yet when it was thrown at Fischer suddenly, he faced its consequences alone and won by applying simple, classic principles. Upon completion of the match, Petrosian remarked: [...] "After the sixth game Fischer really did become a genius. I on the other hand, either had a breakdown or was tired, or something else happened, but the last three games were no longer chess." [...] "Some experts kept insisting that Petrosian was off form, and that he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> plus score {{at the end of the}} sixth game..."

30|$|To {{understand}} why the average size of the accounts <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>an</b> effect on the penalty, let us consider two banks that paid similar penalties, but <b>had</b> very different compositions of accounts.
