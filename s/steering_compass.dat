60|$|Now Deviation is the {{variation}} in the needle caused by the distribution of iron on board of ship. This purely local variation I derived from the deviation card of my standard compass and then applied to the Correct Magnetic Course. The result was the Compass Course. And yet, not yet. My standard compass was amidships on the companionway. My <b>steering</b> <b>compass</b> was aft, in the cockpit, near the wheel. When the <b>steering</b> <b>compass</b> pointed west-by-south three- quarters-south (the steering course), the standard compass pointed west-one-half-north, which was certainly not the steering course. I kept the Snark up till she was heading west-by-south-three-quarters- south on the standard compass, which gave, on the <b>steering</b> <b>compass,</b> south-west-by-west.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, sir," [...] was the steward's acknowledgment, ere he ran aft, {{disrupted}} the binnacle, {{and carried the}} <b>steering</b> <b>compass</b> back to the boat.|$|E
60|$|I ordered Tom Spink to the long-idle wheel, {{and gave}} him the course, which was due east by the <b>steering</b> <b>compass.</b> This put the wind on our port quarter, so that the Elsinore began to move through the water before a fair breeze. And due east, less than a {{thousand}} miles away, lay the coast of South America and the port of Valparaiso.|$|E
50|$|The grid <b>steering</b> <b>compasses</b> (Type P8 to Type P11) were {{fitted in}} World War II Spitfire aeroplanes, {{replacing}} the old P4 series of instruments. They {{were used for}} course setting and reading, and as a check compass on aircraft fitted with a remote indicating compass.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was a good}} move, too, {{in other}} ways. She made Kina-Kina order his people to return all the gear they'd {{stripped}} from the Martha. And back it came, day after day, <b>steering</b> <b>compasses,</b> blocks and tackles, sails, coils of rope, medicine chests, ensigns, signal flags--everything, in fact, except the trade goods and supplies which had already been kai- kai'd. Of course, she gave them a few sticks of tobacco {{to keep them in}} good humour." ...|$|R
5000|$|Sailing ships {{generally}} had {{two kinds}} of compasses: <b>steering</b> <b>compasses,</b> two {{of which would be}} mounted in a binnacle in front of the helm for use in maintaining a course; and a bearing compass that was used for taking the bearings of celestial objects, landmarks and the ship's wake. The latter could be moved around the ship, and it was soon observed that the bearing could vary from one part of the ship to another. The explorer Joao de Castro was the first to report such an inconsistency, in 1538, and attributed it to the ship's gun. Many other objects were found to be sources of deviation in ships, including iron particles in brass compass bowls; iron nails in a wooden compass box or binnacle; and metal parts of clothing. The two <b>steering</b> <b>compasses</b> themselves could interfere with each other if they were set too close together. The [...] "bearing compass" [...] was eventually sited in a fixed position in a binicale with, as far as possible, an all round view and acquired the name [...] "standard compass" [...] It would nonetheless have a different deviation to the [...] "steering compass" [...] so the compass heading shown on the [...] "steering compass" [...] would be different to the compass heading shown on the [...] "standard compass".|$|R
50|$|A grid compass {{known as}} well as grid <b>steering</b> <b>compass,</b> is a {{navigating}} instrument. It is a design of magnetic compass that facilitates steering a steady course without the risk of parallax error.|$|E
50|$|The {{azimuth compass}} still had great value in letting {{the master of}} a ship {{determine}} how far the magnetic compass varied from true north, so he could set a more accurate course while following a line of constant latitude or using dead reckoning to navigate.In 1795 a British First Rate ship would have up to eight compasses, of which one was an improved <b>steering</b> <b>compass.</b> This azimuth compass may have been specialized {{for the purpose of}} measuring magnetic variation through taking readings from stars, and used to determine the accuracy of the other compasses.|$|E
50|$|The grid compass is the {{simplest}} <b>steering</b> <b>compass</b> from the pilot's or helmsman's point of view, because he doesn't {{need to watch}} the number (or the division mark) of the wanted course. He has only to steer the craft so that the N/S compass needle lies parallel between {{the lines of the}} overlay disc. The principle is similar to the compass controlled autopilot". Although sophisticated electronics have taken over for commercial navigation, light aircraft, gliders and yachtsmen still use the grid compass because of its simplicity and ease of use.|$|E
60|$|The boat {{which was}} under sail, did not pause, {{and nothing more}} was said. With a {{magnificent}} rush it passed us, and shot away into the darkness. Our reply had been heard, and the lifeboat, <b>steering</b> by <b>compass,</b> went straight as an arrow to the rescue.|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} {{component of}} P 545 consisted of writing software to control an autonomous golf cart. Sensors on the cart included a GPS tracker, <b>steering</b> sensor, <b>compass,</b> and vision and ranging sensors 1 Actuators included steering control, throttle, and braking. I did not utilize the cartâ€™s braking capability i...|$|R
5000|$|With the {{introduction}} of iron ships, the negative effect of the metal hull on <b>steering</b> <b>compasses</b> was noted. It was also observed that lightning strikes {{had a significant effect}} on compass deviation, identified in some extreme cases as being caused by the reversal of the ship's magnetic signature. In 1866, Evan Hopkins of London registered a patent for a process [...] "to depolarise iron vessels and leave them thenceforth free from any compass-disturbing influence whatever". The technique was described as follows: [...] "For this purpose he employed a number of Grove's batteries and electromagnets. The latter were to be passed along the plates till the desired end had been obtained... the process must not be overdone for fear of re-polarising in the opposite direction." [...] The invention was, however, reported to be [...] "incapable of being carried to a successful issue", and [...] "quickly died a natural death".|$|R
5000|$|Waddington styled himself [...] "Teacher of Mathematics at the Mathematical Academy in Three Tun-court, Mile's-lane, London", {{where he}} taught {{officers}} of the East India Company and also sold Hadley's quadrants. In 1763 he attempted, unsuccessfully, to gain employment from the Royal Society. By 1764 he had moved to Rolls Building, Chancery Lane. He reported to Piggott his hopes that he and Maskelyne might gain {{the interest of the}} Board of Longitude but his only formal approach to them seems to have been in 1771, when a petition was read at a meeting on 11 May stating that he had much improved, and successfully trialled, the <b>steering</b> <b>compass,</b> or binnacle.|$|E
40|$|A {{description}} of the test methods used at the National Bureau of Standards for determining the characteristics of aircraft compasses is given. The methods described are particularly applicable to compasses in which mineral oil is used as the damping liquid. Data on the viscosity and density of certain mineral oils used in United States Navy aircraft compasses are presented. Characteristics of Navy aircraft compasses IV to IX and some other compasses are shown for the range of temperatures experienced in flight. Results of flight tests are presented. These {{results indicate that the}} characteristic most desired in a <b>steering</b> <b>compass</b> is a short period and, in a check compass, a low overswing...|$|E
50|$|At {{the same}} time, traffic between the Mediterranean and {{northern}} Europe also increased, with first evidence of direct commercial voyages from the Mediterranean into the English Channel {{coming in the}} closing decades of the 13th century, and one factor {{may be that the}} compass made traversal of the Bay of Biscay safer and easier. However, critics like Kreutz have suggested that it was later in 1410 that anyone really started <b>steering</b> by <b>compass.</b>|$|R
5000|$|At about noon on 6 July 1918 a {{squadron}} of five German seaplanes returning from a daylight raid on Lowestoft and Walmer came across [...] on the surface 15 mi east of Orford Ness. Their machine-gun attack killed the commanding officer and four other men, as well as mortally wounding the coxswain. The <b>steering</b> gear, <b>compasses</b> and radio were all damaged. The first lieutenant, Sub Lieutenant Cobb, {{attracted the attention of}} [...] at about 12:45, and a tow was established. The seaplanes carried out further attacks on both submarines between 3:18 and 3:45 pm, and {{it was not until the}} arrival of Lurcher that the enemy seaplanes were driven off.|$|R
50|$|With {{the wind}} S.W. by W. <b>steering</b> by <b>compass</b> N.E. by E. at 10 a.m. {{the water was}} discoloured. A man at the foretop saw a breach rise ahead of us. We put our helm hard a starboard...and {{weathered}} the N.W. end of it about half a mile...The breach that we first saw {{happened to be the}} northernmost of all, there being several and by our computation they are 20 miles in length. Within the breaches, several small white sandy islands were seen, with some bushes on them. A very heavy sea broke against the south part of these shoals. When close to them the mainland was not seen.|$|R
2500|$|On {{merchant}} ships, it {{is taught}} at the various maritime academies that {{the proper way to}} relieve the helm is for the helmsman being relieved to call out loudly the ship's course per gyro, course per standard magnetic <b>compass,</b> <b>steering</b> mode, rudder angle, and the pump the vessel is steering off of. The relief helmsman will then take the helm and repeat all the information to ensure that he/she knows what to steer while on watch. An example of this would be: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When we {{were fairly}} {{out of sight}} of the island we lay to till it got dusk, and then her head was pointed back again. There was scarce a breath of wind stirring, and the vessel went through the water so slowly that a couple of hours later the captain ordered the boats to be lowered, for he saw that if the wind didn't freshen the ship could not get to the island, much less get away again, before daylight. The oars were got out and off we started, and after four hours' steady rowing, the lieutenant, who was <b>steering</b> by <b>compass,</b> made out the land looming high above us. Another quarter of an hour's row and we dropped our grapnels close to the foot of the cliffs, and the men were told to get a sleep as well as they could till morning.|$|R
60|$|With a {{sufficient}} quantity of meat {{to stave off}} their anxiety regarding the question of food, the men spent two days enjoying a badly needed rest; and then they pushed on, making forced marches which severely taxed their strength. Part of their way, however, lay across open country, for they were near {{the northern edge of}} the timber belt, and the straggling trees, dwarfed and bent by the wind, ran east and west in a deeply indented line. In some places they boldly stretched out toward the Pole in long promontories; in others they fell back in wide bays which Blake, <b>steering</b> by <b>compass,</b> held straight across, afterward plunging again into the scrub. Three days were spent in struggling through the broadest tongue, but, as a rule, a few hours' arduous march brought them out into the open. Even there the ground was very rough and broken, and they were thankful for the numerous frozen creeks and lakes which provided an easier road.|$|R
60|$|Light {{snow was}} driving across the waste before a savage wind when the party sat at breakfast one morning a {{fortnight}} after Blake had shot the caribou. They {{had spent the}} first two days enjoying a badly needed rest, {{but the rest of the}} time had been passed in forced marches which severely taxed their strength.

60|$|They heave the log {{every two}} hours,--that is, twelve times for every twenty-four hours,--and from the reports which the captain {{receives}} {{of the results}} of those trials, it is easy for him to calculate how far the ship has come during the whole period. As he knows, too, exactly how far the pilot has been <b>steering</b> by the <b>compass</b> all this time, he has both the direction in which the ship has been sailing, and the distance to which she has come; and, of course, from these data he can calculate where she must now be. This mode of determining the ship's place is called by the reckoning. The other is called by observation.|$|R
60|$|He had two Spaniards {{who could}} be trusted to keep the steamer more or less on the course he gave them, while the Cumbria steerd handily, {{which is more than}} all steamers do. There was a {{large-scale}} chart, considerably mildewed, but still legible, in the skipper's room, as well as a pilot guide to the West African coast, while the patent log that towed astern to record the distance run appeared to be working accurately. He could thus, it was evident, depend in some degree upon what is termed dead reckoning, which is comparatively reliable in the case of short distances run in the vicinity of a high, well lighted coast. The one the Cumbria steamed along was, however, not lighted at all, and most of it scarcely rose a foot above sea-level, while when he had ruled the line she was presumed to be travelling on across the chart, and pricked off the distance the patent log told him she had run, there remained the question how far the tide and the Guinea stream had deflected it, and whether the <b>steering</b> and her <b>compasses</b> could be trusted.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, some of {{the ideas}} of {{positioning}} and navigation using GPS (Global Positioning System) where explored, GPS is a satellite-based navigation system made up of a network of 24 satellites placed into orbit by the U. S. Department of Defense. This paper provides the use of a handheld GPS receiver in the areas of precise positioning, mapping locations, navigating across the mapped locations very easily. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to showcase the experiences that incurred in designing a positioning and navigation system (with the aid of a 12 parallel channel handheld GPS), which can be used as a moving <b>compass,</b> <b>steering</b> to any mapped destination, providing the information about near by places, tourist attractions, petrol bunks etc. The Magellan 310 handheld GPS which is being used for developing the proposed system allows users to connect to a personal computer through RS- 232 Serial Interface and the protocol used by the device for communication is NMEA 0183, (National Marine Electronics Association). It is an American national regulatory body, which, among other things, sets standards pertaining to the interfacing of marine electronic devices. This NMEA 0183 Protocol transmits data to the connected PC every 1 second, this data has to be interpreted and filtered accordingly to get the needed information from the GPS device. This paper provides a case study in the process of designing such a system and its limitations in the era where through distance measurements from a few more satellites, the receiver can determine the user's position and display it on the unit's electronic map. It also portrays the implementation details and their results obtained and along their pros and cons when compared with the other existing positioning and navigation system designed for basic handheld GPS (without having advance features like provision for electronic map etc. in the device), It also addresses some of th...|$|R
