When dynamics doesn’t correlate with mechanical system design, unwanted frequencies in the system are exited. Sometimes we haven’t conditions (whether material or space) to design mechanical system with resonant frequencies too high to be exited. In that case we must choose compensating methods which can eliminate these phenomenons. This paper is dedicated to them...|$|E

5|$|Servo {{controlled}} subwoofers are not {{the same}} as <b>Servodrive</b> subwoofers whose primary mechanism of sound reproduction avoids the normal voice coil and magnet combination in favor of a high-speed belt-driven servomotor. The <b>Servodrive</b> design increases output power, reduces harmonic distortion and virtually eliminates the loss of loudspeaker output that results from an increase in voice coil impedance due to overheating of the voice coil (called power compression.) This feature allows high power operation for extended periods of time. Intersonics was nominated for a TEC Award for its Servo Drive Loudspeaker (SDL) design in 1986 and for the Bass Tech 7 model in 1990.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a synthesis of}} a nonlinear switching control of a rotational electropneumatic <b>servodrive</b> using a sliding mode approach. A nonlinear sliding mode control law {{is applied to the}} system under consideration. First, the model of the electropneumatic <b>servodrive</b> is developed. This model is nonlinear with respect to both the state variables and the control input. It is transformed to be linear with respect to a new control variable and a coordinate transformation is then related to make possible the implementation of the nonlinear discontinuous controller. Two sliding mode controllers are synthesized with and without an integral term in the switching surface. The sliding regimes are particularly pointed out and their stability analyzed to show that the integral discontinuous control provides best results especially for a steady-state error cancellation. Practical considerations are proposed for choosing the control parameters and finally, the experimental results are presented and discussed...|$|R

The high performance capability of the motor, due to the strong anisotropy of the internal structure of the induced element, makes it suitable for <b>servodrives</b> applications, especially using the proposed control strategy. The strategy, obtained using an optimization procedure, allows to obtain the maximum thrust to current ratio from the current supplied motor. Computer simulation results of a speed and position controlled drive highlights the drive performance. A laboratory version of the drive for short stroke application is tested as position control system.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the features of}} a pneumatically actuated servomechanism which has been designed for the point-to-point positioning of payloads. The servomechanism utilises low cost computer control and interface electronics to facilitate software compensations for system time delays and non-linearities. The compensation algorithms hve been designed and developed with reference to a linearised model of pneumatic <b>servodrives,</b> which allows for variation in transfer function with load position. Application of these algorithms has allowed a substantial improvement in static performance and dynamic characteristics to be realised for drives incorporating various forms of pneumatic servo valves, pneumatic actuators and load systems. This offers a significant opportunity for commercial exploitation of the pneumatic servodrive. The paper {{describes the}} method by which compensation is achieved and references experimental data, which have been obtained by using a standardised evaluation procedure...|$|E
40|$|The {{servodrive}} analyzed here consists {{on a large}} stroke actuator of 2 meters, {{activated by}} a flow proportional valve. The aim of the Ph. D. is to achieve a successful control of the actuator despite it having big chambers, which has a big influence on the system response, owing to the air compressibility. For the experimental study, a test bench has been built and a magnetorrestrictive sensor of displacement is used in order to close the loop. Before starting {{the control of the}} system and in order to know how the pneumatic servo drive reacts, the interaction of the actuator and valve set has been studied by means of Bond Graph technique. At first, the PID control was applied in pneumatic <b>servodrives,</b> after seeing its several problems, state control algorithm started to be applied. The state loop control algorithm reaches a good result, however in cases where a system parameter changes it is necessary to retune the state variable gains (position, velocity and accelera-tion), above all in this particular case. It is here where Fuzzy Logic reasoning could be used. Key words: Servo pneumatic drive, bond graph, state loop control, fuzzy controller. ...|$|E

40|$|The authors detail two {{servo-control}} strategies which {{improve the}} performance of <b>servodriven</b> electro-hydraulic robotic manipulators. The first servo-controller is pragmatic approach based on both empirical controller design and fuzzy logic and results presented demonstrate that its performance clearly surpasses that of the conventional P-controller. The second servo-controller is a robust state-space controller designed by applying the Ackermann parameter space method. This controller uses both the measured angular position and acceleration as state-variables to directly control the angular position of the revolute joints. In {{order to determine the}} angular acceleration, a contact-free acceleration sensor based on the Ferraris principle has been developed and described in detail. Results are presented which clearly demonstrate the improvement of the servo-control quality through use of the acceleration sensor. ...|$|R

40|$|Studies of {{a number}} of STOL {{aircraft}} show that relatively high maximum lift-coefficients and large increases in lift due to power are within the present state of the art. With these lift characteristics, approach speeds of the order of 60 knots for aircraft of moderate wing loading can be realized. Full advantage of the STOL performance of aircraft such as those discussed herein may not be realized on a routine operational basis, however, without some form of damping augmentation system because of lateral-directional handling considerations, particularly for large aircraft operating under instrument flight conditions. Satisfactory characteristics can be obtained by use of only a <b>servodriven</b> rudder. Additional experience is needed to determine how the STOL aircraft is to be operated before more firm requirements for augmentation systems can be established...|$|R
40|$|This paper quantitatively {{reports about}} {{potential}} energy savings on robotic assembly lines for the automotive industry. At first, a detailed system model is described, which improves previously published results by explicitly considering both manipulator and electrical drive dynamics. The model closely captures experimental data {{in terms of}} actuation torques and <b>servodrive</b> voltages, which are directly used to derive the plant input power. Then, two practical methods for reducing the overall energy consumption are evaluated. The methods rely on: 1) implementation of energy-optimal trajectories, obtained by means of time scaling, concerning the robots’ motion from the last process point to the home positions; 2) reduction of the energy consumption via earlier release of the actuator brake when the robots are kept stationary. Simulation results, based on the production timing characteristics measured on a real plant, clearly shows that the system energy consumption can be effectively reduced without negative effects on the production rate...|$|R
40|$|In a basic, {{ram-type}} EDM system (figure 1 - 1 O), the {{ram head}} is driven {{up and down}} with extreme accuracy by a <b>servodriven</b> system. The servo system is controlled by a microprocessor connected to the power supply. The power supply is solid-state and is also microprocessor controlled. One lead from the power supply is connected to the workpiece, which is immersed in a tank of dielectric oil. The dielectric tank is connected to a dielectric pump, an oil reservoir, and a filter system. The pump provides pressure for flushing the work area and moving the oil while the filter system removes and traps debris in the oil. The oil reservoir stores surplus oil and provides a container for draining the oil between operations. The other lead from the power supply is connected to the electrode. The power supply provides a pulsed DC output to the electrode/workpiece system. On-times and off-times are set manually, along with voltage and current values. When the EDM machine is turned on, the servo microprocessor, sensing that the gap is too wide for cutting to take place, signals the servo mechanism to lower the ram head. When the first spark jumps the gap, downward travel of the ram head stops. With the gap setting held constant, the process gradually erodes the surface. When enough metal has been removed to change the gap distance, the microprocessor senses this and signals the servo mechanism to advance the ram head sufficiently to maintain the proper gap width, and the process continues...|$|R
