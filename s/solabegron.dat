40|$|Purpose: We {{investigated}} {{the presence of}} functional ß 1, ß 2 and ß 3 -adrenoceptor in urothelium and detrusor muscle of human bladder through in vitro pharmacology of selective ß 3 adrenoceptor agonist <b>solabegron.</b> Materials and Methods: Expression of these adrenoceptors in surgically separated human urothelium and detrusor muscle were investigated using RT-PCR. The effects of activating these receptors were studied by determining the relaxation produced by ß-adrenoceptors agonist in pre-contracted human detrusor strips. Results: The results confirmed the presence of mRNA for ß 1, ß 2 and ß 3 -adrenoceptor in both human urothelium and detrusor. In an in vitro functional bladder assay, <b>Solabegron</b> and other agonists for ß-adrenoceptors such as procaterol and isoproterenol evoked potent concentration-dependent relaxation of isolated human bladder strips with pD 2 values of 8. 73 ± 0. 19, 5. 08 ± 0. 48 and 6. 28 ± 0. 54, respectively. Conclusions: Selective ß 3 -adrenoceptor agonist may be a potential new treatment for the overactive bladder OAB syndrome. Existence of ß 3 -adrenoceptor mRNA exists in the urothelium {{in addition to the}} detrusor muscle suggest multiple site of actions for the ß 3 -adrenoceptor in the lower urinary tract...|$|E
40|$|We have {{reviewed}} {{the safety and}} tolerability of β 3 -adrenoceptor agonists, specifically mirabegron and <b>solabegron,</b> a newly emerging drug class {{for the treatment of}} the overactive bladder syndrome. We discuss them mechanistically in the context of expression and other preclinical data. Based on a systematic PubMed search, incidence of overall adverse events, hypertension, dry mouth, and constipation are comparable between mirabegron or <b>solabegron</b> and placebo. Hypertension is the most frequently observed adverse event, but has a similar incidence with mirabegron and placebo. Nevertheless, severe uncontrolled hypertension has become a contraindication for use of mirabegron based on observation of severe hypertension in association with mirabegron exposure. The overall incidence of adverse events is also similar between mirabegron and the muscarinic receptor antagonist tolterodine, but the incidence of dry mouth is much lower with mirabegron. The high β 3 -adrenoceptor mRNA expression in the human ovaries is not associated with reproductive side effects. Generally, β 3 -adrenoceptors exhibit a rather restricted expression in human tissues, which may explain the overall good tolerability of agonists acting on this receptor. We propose that expression profiles and functional preclinical studies can be important tools in the prediction of adverse event profiles in first-in-class drug...|$|E
40|$|AbstractContextMirabegron, {{the first}} β 3 -adrenoceptor agonist in {{clinical}} practice, is approved {{for treatment of}} overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome symptoms. Because β 3 -adrenoceptors are expressed in cardiovascular (CV) tissues, there are concerns that OAB treatment with β 3 -adrenoceptor agonists may affect the heart and vasculature. ObjectiveTo provide a summary of CV effects of β 3 -adrenoceptor agonists in clinical studies. Evidence acquisitionA systematic literature search from inception until November 2014 was performed on studies in PubMed and Medline. Evidence synthesisTwenty papers, published between 1994 and 2014, were identified: mirabegron (16), <b>solabegron</b> (2), AK- 677 (1), and BRL 35135 (1). More detailed CV data from mirabegron studies were available in online regulatory documents filed with the US Food and Drug Administration and the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. ConclusionsThe CV safety of mirabegron appears to be acceptable at therapeutic doses and comparable with that of antimuscarinic agents, currently first-line therapy for OAB. Patient summaryIn this review {{we looked at the}} cardiovascular (CV) effects of β 3 -adrenoceptor agonists used for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB). The CV safety of mirabegron (the only clinically approved β 3 -adrenoceptor agonist) appears to be acceptable at therapeutic doses and comparable with that of antimuscarinic agents, the current first-line therapy for OAB...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, the {{synthesis}} of enantioenriched compounds using novel methodologies that employ metal- and biocatalysis is described. In the first part, {{the synthesis}} of enantioenriched cyanohydrins, which are highly versatile synthetic intermediates, is described. A minor enantiomer recycling methodology, which uses a catalytic system consisting of a titanium salen dimer and a lipase, was highly successful in yielding the desired products, often in essentially enantiopure form. Alternatively, when the minor enantiomer recycling method gave unsatisfactory results, the same two catalysts were used in a sequential two-step process. The minor enantiomer recycling procedure was used to synthesize three different β-adrenergic antagonists with very high enantiomeric excesses via the corresponding O-acetylated cyanohydrins. With the same cyclic process, O-(α-bromoacyl) cyanohydrins were synthesized and subsequently transformed to aminofuranones via an intramolecular Blaise reaction. In addition, substitution of the bromide in the O-(α-bromoacyl) cyanohydrins with different nitrogen nucleophiles followed by reduction gave N-substituted β-amino alcohols. This reaction sequence was applied to {{the synthesis of}} the β 3 -adrenergic receptor agonist <b>solabegron.</b> Finally, the O-(α-bromoacyl) cyanohydrins were subjected to a palladium catalyzed cross-coupling with a range of boronic acids. This reaction proceeded with high yields, and was performed with enantiopure substrates with no or only minor racemization of the resulting products. In the second part, the first asymmetric direct addition of acylphosphonates to aldehydes is described. This transformation is catalyzed by a tridentate Schiff base aluminum(III) Lewis acidic complex, a Lewis base, and a Brønstedt base. Several aromatic and aliphatic acetoxyphosphonates were isolated, in most cases in high yields. Unfortunately, the enantioselectivity in the reaction was only moderate. Therefore, an investigation to develop a minor enantiomer recycling system for the synthesis of acetoxyphosphonates was initiated, but a working cyclic process could not be found in this work.
