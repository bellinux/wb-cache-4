40|$|This paper reports an {{essential}} part of a wider research activity, which entails the development of a procedure for the Determination of the Optimal Prosthesis Architecture (DOPA) for a given upper limb amputee. A fundamental algorithm of the DOPA procedure performs the kinematic analysis of several prosthetic arm models (also with less than the six degrees of freedom normally required to correctly execute a generic manipulation task). The algorithm must simulate the execution of important daily living activities performed by a prosthesis and thus it requires reference trajectories of the hand. By means of experimental analysis, 59 trajectories of the hand of an able-bodied subject were acquired to identify a modality to correctly perform the corresponding tasks. This paper illustrates in detail the stages of task analysis, experimental acquisition and data processing in order to define the required reference trajectories. The obtained reference trajectories are a temporal succession of the hand pose (position and orientation). A customized algorithm automatically selects the most relevant poses to be considered for the definition of the reference trajectory. The hand pose is reported in the Cartesian Space by means of Natural Coordinates. In order to correctly execute a given task the pose error admitted for the end-effector of the different architectures is associated to each trajectory.

Across {{a broad range of}} conditions, we find that the key governing equation for atmospheres and quantum harmonic oscillators are identical, even when forcing (stellar irradiation), sources of friction (molecular viscosity, Rayleigh drag and magnetic drag) and magnetic tension are included. The global atmospheric structure is largely controlled by a single, key parameter that involves the Rossby and Prandtl numbers. This near-universality breaks down when either molecular viscosity or magnetic drag acts non-uniformly across latitude or a poloidal magnetic field is present, suggesting that these effects will introduce qualitative changes to the familiar chevron-shaped feature witnessed in simulations of atmospheric circulation. We also find that hydrodynamic and magnetic sources of friction have dissimilar phase signatures and affect the flow in fundamentally different ways, implying that using Rayleigh drag to mimic magnetic drag is inaccurate. We exhaustively lay down the theoretical formalism (dispersion relations, governing equations and time-dependent wave solutions) for a broad suite of models. In all situations, we derive the steady state of an atmosphere, which is relevant to interpreting infrared phase and eclipse maps of exoplanetary atmospheres. We elucidate a pinching effect that confines the atmospheric structure to be near the equator.

40|$|Abstract: The goal of {{classical}} philosophical physics {{was to identify}} 'Physical Reality', sought for many centuries. The natural philosophers believed {{that there is a}} physical reality of nature which when we find it will tell us the origin of the natural laws and the connections between microphysics and cosmology. Richard Feynman wrote of this, in connection with the Conservation of Energy. He said, "Nature has a hidden accountant who keeps honest books of energy input and output but we don't know how she does it. " The great philosophers of cosmology, Clifford, Mach, Einstein, Wyle, Dirac, Schroedinger, and others have pointed out that only a wave structure of matter (particles) can conform to experimental data and fulfill the logic of reality and cosmology. Such a Quantum Wave Structure of Matter (WSM) has been found in the last decade (see references). Since the WSM provides a quantitative origin of the fundamental natural laws, it becomes the basis of everything in science. It is Physical Reality. It is described here. Only three basic principles of Nature underlie the structure of matter- reviewed here. For the electron, the structure is a pair of spherical outward and inward quantum waves, convergent to a center, existing in ordinary space and termed a space resonance. This wave pair is also the physical origin of the previously unknown electron quantum spin- described here. Spin occurs when the inward quantum wave undergoes <b>spherical</b> <b>rotation</b> to become the outward wave. These two waves are a Dirac spinor satisfying the theoretical Dirac Equation. Thus the space resonance has a binary basis like computer hardware...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the novel architecture of a 5 -DoF parallel kinematics mechanism, purposely conceived for accurate machining of conical revolute surfaces. The industrial interest {{of this kind}} of operation is remarkable, e. g. for production of optical equipments. The proposed architecture belongs to the class of Interconnected-Chains Parallel Kinematics Machines, IC-PKMs, since the moving platform is connected to the fixed base not by independent serial chains, but by interconnected chains. The end-effector behaves like a spindle; its mobility consists of three rotational freedoms around a <b>spherical</b> center of <b>rotation</b> (one is the rotation about the spindle axis) and two translational freedoms in a plane of the pencil of planes defined by a fixed axis (revolute axis) through the <b>spherical</b> center of <b>rotation.</b> While one actuator commands the location of the <b>spherical</b> center of <b>rotation</b> along the revolute axis and one actuator provides the rotation about the spindle axis, the three other actuators command the orientation of the spindle and its heave along the spindle axis.

40|$|Computation {{of global}} {{illumination}} {{is an important}} means {{in the pursuit of}} photorealism of computer-generated images. It is of particular importance in scenes with glossy surfaces, since it conditions correct perception of glossy material characteristics. This dissertation focuses on efficient computation of global illumination in presence of glossy surfaces with low-frequency reflectance functions. Computing global illumination on those surfaces is difficult with pure Monte Carlo sampling because of the sheer number of rays required to get a good estimate of indirect illumination. We propose radiance caching, a ray tracing-based algorithm for computing indirect illumination on glossy surfaces with low-frequency reflectance functions. The algorithm takes advantage of the shading smoothness on these surfaces by interpolating indirect illumination from a set of sparsely distributed, cached values.
