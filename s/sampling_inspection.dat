50|$|In oil tankers {{and other}} marine vessels used for {{transporting}} fluid products, there are small service openings though the deck into each tank to allow access for miscellaneous reasons such as <b>sampling,</b> <b>inspection,</b> gauging and cleaning. When the service opening {{is not in}} use, it is sealed by a removable cover plate, {{commonly referred to as}} a Butterworth cover. Butterworth hatches are not the main access hatches, but are the servicing hatches, and are generally closed with a metal cover plate with a gasket that is fastened to the deck by a number of bolts which stick up from the deck. Holes on the edges of the plate fit over these bolts and the cover is fastened down with nuts or dogs.|$|E
50|$|Separation {{processes}} include filtration, settling (sedimentation), extraction or leaching, distillation, recrystallization or precipitation (followed by filtration or settling), reverse osmosis, drying, and adsorption. Heat exchangers {{are often}} used for heating or cooling, including boiling or condensation, often {{in conjunction with other}} units such as distillation towers. There may also be storage tanks for storing feedstock, intermediate or final products, or waste. Storage tanks commonly have level indicators to show how full they are. There may be structures holding or supporting sometimes massive units and their associated equipment. There are often stairs, ladders, or other steps for personnel to reach points in the units for <b>sampling,</b> <b>inspection,</b> or maintenance. An area of a plant or facility with numerous storage tanks is sometimes called a tank farm, especially at an oil depot.|$|E

5000|$|SPC was {{pioneered by}} Walter A. Shewhart at Bell Laboratories {{in the early}} 1920s. Shewhart {{developed}} the control chart in 1924 {{and the concept of}} a state of statistical control. Statistical control is equivalent to the concept of exchangeability developed by logician William Ernest Johnson also in 1924 in his book Logic, Part III: The Logical Foundations of Science. [...] Along with a team at AT&T that included Harold Dodge and Harry Romig he worked to put <b>sampling</b> <b>inspection</b> on a rational statistical basis as well. Shewhart consulted with Colonel Leslie E. Simon in the application of control charts to munitions manufacture at the Army's Picatinny Arsenal in 1934. That successful application helped convince Army Ordnance to engage AT&T's George Edwards to consult on the use of statistical quality control among its divisions and contractors at the outbreak of World War II.|$|E
40|$|Buyers have {{imperfect}} {{information about}} the food safety efforts exerted by suppliers. To gather information about safety, buyers often employ <b>sampling</b> <b>inspection.</b> <b>Sampling</b> <b>inspection</b> exhibits sampling error so some unsafe product passes inspection and some safe product does not. This uncertainty influences buyer and supplier behavior. In this article, I use a principal-agent model to examine how <b>sampling</b> <b>inspection</b> policies influence food safety. I use the model to examine the <b>sampling</b> <b>inspection</b> policies in the 1996 Pathogen Reduction/Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point Act. I conclude that the regulation of <b>sampling</b> <b>inspection</b> procedures is an effective tool for policy makers who wish to improve food safety. Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: To {{reduce the}} cost of food inspection, we built a minimum cost <b>sampling</b> <b>inspection</b> model on the basis of simple random sampling, and ensured that the {{reliability}} of <b>sampling</b> <b>inspection</b> lived up to the required reliability at the same time. In this model, according to the relationship between inspected qualified rate and standard qualified rate, we adjusted the sample size through relaxing and tightening the inspection. The result shows that this plan can greatly reduce the inspect cost. Besides, the model is flexible, and it can formulate different <b>sampling</b> <b>inspection</b> plans according to the required reliability...|$|E

40|$|Sanden international, an {{automobile}} {{air conditioning compressor}} manufacturer, was facing a problem in its incoming material inspection procedures. Although the company had designed and was using its own sampling plan, some managers and supervisors where not confident of its reliability. Sanden recently established a goal for its total number of defects per supplier as one part per million. Achievement of this target required reviews of the existing sampling plan. The purpose of this project was to help Sandra identify the best alternatives for its incoming material inspection procedures. To do that considerations were made about the usefulness of <b>sampling</b> <b>inspections,</b> theoretical aspects of <b>inspection</b> <b>sampling</b> plans were examined, current sampling plans were analyzed and recommendations were made...|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} of an upward {{shift in the}} fraction defective of a repetitive process is considered using the geometric CUSUM. This CUSUM makes use of the {{information provided by the}} run-lengths of non-defective items between successive defective items, and was initially developed for the case of 100 % inspection. This paper considers the geometric CUSUM under <b>sampling</b> <b>inspection,</b> and emphasizes that the pattern of <b>sampling</b> <b>inspection</b> can be quite haphazard without causing any difficulty for the operation of the CUSUM. Two separate mechanisms for the occurrence of a shift are considered. Methods for evaluating zero-state and steady-state ARL are presented for both 100 % inspection and <b>sampling</b> <b>inspection.</b> Parameter choice is also considered, and recommendations made. Comparisons with some np -charts are provided. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the theory and {{implementation}} of acceptance sampling by attributes. It culminates {{in the design and}} development of a user friendly software package for creating, storing and indexing <b>sampling</b> <b>inspection</b> plans. A detailed review of the most widely used <b>sampling</b> <b>inspection</b> schemes is carried out, with particular emphasis on the methods for indexing sampling plans. In addition, the existing methods for constructing single and double sampling plans are studied with and without cost structures. The design of a software package for <b>sampling</b> <b>inspection</b> theory is constructed {{on the basis of this}} review. This software incorporates some new algorithms as well as refirement of existing algorithms. Throughout the design of the software package, particular emphasis is placed on the need for a friendly man-machine interface. The description of the package is made through three main routes: description of the "logic", description of the man-machine interface and implementation using algorithms.

40|$|Acceptance {{sampling}} plans are the practical tools for quality assurance applications involving product quality control. Acceptance sampling systems are advocated when {{small sample size}} are necessary or desirable towards costlier testing for product quality.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{maintaining}} quality of inventory {{in the presence}} of deterioration is studied. Repeated application of <b>sampling</b> <b>inspections</b> together with replacement policies are used to maintain quality. The effect of such repeated applications can be measured in terms of the proportion of poor product existing at any time. In this paper, the sampling plans studied are those commonly used in acceptance sampling, and the replacement policy consists in replacing lots judged defective by the sampling procedure. The theory of Markov processes is used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the sampling plans and replacement policy. As illustrations, special cases are considered.

40|$|In {{line with}} the {{continuous}} improvement theory, the learning phenomenon is often incorporated into models for predicting {{the evolution of the}} unitary quality costs. In this paper, the quality metric predicted is the rate of supplied non-conforming units through a learning process with autonomous and induced sources of experience. The former is simply learning by doing, i. e. supplying, whilst the latter is driven by the allocation of training hours to suppliers. A revised learning model with time-varying learning rates is proposed for embracing both these effects into a multistage assembly/production setting. A single-period preventionâappraisalâfailure cost function is achieved, and the <b>sample</b> <b>inspection</b> rates adopted among suppliers are also considered in order to evaluate their effect. If these sample rates are given, the goal of allocating the training hours among suppliers is pursued by means of integer linear programming. Otherwise, a mixed-integer quadratic problem arises for the concurrent allocation of training hours and <b>inspection</b> <b>sample</b> rates among suppliers. A case study is finally carried out for demonstrating the applicability of the model, as well as for providing managerial insights...|$|R

40|$|A Continuous Sampling Plan, CSP-CUSUM, is {{proposed}} {{based on the}} use of Cumulative Sums (CUSUMs) for deciding when to switch between the phases of <b>sampling</b> <b>inspection</b> and 100 % inspection. The Geometric CUSUM, also termed the Run-length CUSUM, is chosen for this purpose, and two separate CUSUMs are to be operated, one for each inspection phase. The conventional measures of performance for CSPs such as average outgoing quality, average fraction inspected, and average proportion passed under <b>sampling</b> <b>inspection</b> are evaluated for CSP-CUSUM, and comparisons with some standard CSPs are presented. An additional performance-measure, Average Cycle Length, {{is proposed}}. A table is provided to aid the choice of parameters for the operation of CSP-CUSUM. It is recommended that a Geometric CUSUM control chart be maintained in parallel with CSP-CUSUM to detect significant upward shifts in the incoming fraction defective. ...|$|E
