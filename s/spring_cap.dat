60|$|Percussion Caps.--Caps may {{be carried}} very {{conveniently}} {{by means of}} a ring, with two dozen nipple-shaped beads, made of some metal, strung upon it; each bead being intended to be covered by a percussion-cap. The beads are cleft down the middle, which gives them a slight springiness, that more effectually secures the caps that are placed upon them: the ring is tied by a thong to the belt or button-hole. It is very Difficult, without this contrivance, to keep caps free from sand, crumbs, and dirt, yet always at hand when required. I can confidently recommend it, though as it is old-fashioned and not well suited for sportsmen in England, it is rarely to be met with. <b>Spring</b> <b>cap</b> holders are, I am sure, too delicate for rough travel.|$|E

50|$|Typically, the {{stiffness}} {{of the body}} is measured in torsion. The body is supported at the <b>spring</b> <b>caps</b> at the rear, and then a torque is applied to the front <b>spring</b> <b>caps</b> via a long beam and a fulcrum. Values achieved range from 1000 lbft Nm per degree for pre-War racing cars, up to 25000 lbft Nm per degree for some modern production vehicles.|$|R

40|$|Effects of {{the angle}} of the target plate on {{particle}} surface modification by the polygonal barrel-sputtering method were investigated by preparing TiO 2 -supported Ru (Ru/TiO 2) samples. The sputtering with Ru was conducted at the target angles of 0, 20, and 45 °. The results showed that the Ru nanoparticles deposited on the TiO 2 particles had small and uniform sizes of ca. 2 ? 4 nm, regardless of the target angle. However, the amount of Ru deposited gradually decreased with the change in the target angle from 0 ° to 20 and 45 °. On the other hand, our sputtering system was redesigned by closing one side of the polygonal barrel and attaching a stainless-steel <b>spring</b> <b>cap</b> to the target holder located {{on the opposite side of}} the barrel, in order to avoid the spillage of particles. As a result, we succeeded in an increase in the sample yield (over 90 %), which will be useful for the practical application of the polygonal barrel-sputtering method...|$|E
