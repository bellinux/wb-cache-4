5|$|Attending Middleton High School {{alongside}} Ron, {{her best}} female friend Monique and rival schoolmate Bonnie Rockwaller, Kim {{lives with her}} family: father James, a rocket scientist, and Ann, a brain surgeon, {{as well as her}} younger brothers, identical twins Jim and Tim, both of whom possess genius-level intellect. Fully aware of their daughter's occupation, Kim's parents remain completely supportive of her crime-fighting endeavors so long as she continues to obey curfew, but tend to be more-so concerned about the character's performance in school, as well as her love life. Lacking a secret identity, Kim is world famous and her profession, although accepted by her peers, is seldom acknowledged by her schoolmates or teachers. Captain of her high school's cheerleading squad, Kim Possible also explores the highs and lows of Kim's life as a high school student attempting to navigate dating, academics, homework, exams and eventually learning to drive, all the while striving to maintain a healthy work-life balance; fighting crime typically comes to Kim more naturally than the more <b>standard</b> <b>components</b> of adolescence.|$|E
25|$|The above logic ICs {{were built}} from <b>standard</b> <b>components,</b> with sizes and {{configurations}} {{defined by the}} technological process, and all the diodes and transistors on one IC were of the same type. The use of different transistor types was first proposed by Tom Long at Sylvania in 1961–1962. In late 1962, Sylvania launched the first family of transistor-transistor logic (TTL) ICs, which became a commercial success. Bob Widlar from Fairchild made a similar breakthrough in 1964–1965 in analog ICs (operational amplifiers).|$|E
25|$|The {{same year}} Eiffel started {{work on a}} system of {{standardised}} prefabricated bridges, an idea that {{was the result of}} a conversation with the governor of Cochin-China. These used a small number of <b>standard</b> <b>components,</b> all small enough to be readily transportable in areas with poor or non-existent roads, and were joined together using bolts rather than rivets, reducing the need for skilled labour on site. A number of different types were produced, ranging from footbridges to standard-gauge railway bridges.|$|E

25|$|Although {{designs and}} {{construction}} vary between brands, basic components of all ballpoint pens are universal. <b>Standard</b> <b>components</b> of a ballpoint tip include the freely rotating ball itself (distributing the ink on the writing surface), a socket holding {{the ball in}} place, small ink channels that provide ink to the ball through the socket, and a self-contained ink reservoir supplying ink to the ball. In modern disposable pens, narrow plastic tubes contain the ink, which is compelled downward to the ball by gravity. Brass, steel, or tungsten carbide are used to manufacture the ball bearing-like points, then housed in a brass socket.|$|E
500|$|The L {{used only}} {{coal-fired}} steam motive power. In 1896, the Hunslet Engine Company submitted two designs (a 2-4-2T and a 4-4-0T), but eventually an order was placed for three 2-6-2Ts from Manning Wardle & Co of Leeds. The locos were named after local rivers: Yeo, Exe, and Taw. These were supplemented by a 2-4-2T, Lyn, {{built by the}} Baldwin Locomotive Works of Philadelphia, USA, as the Company realised that three locos would be insufficient. Baldwin was selected as they could deliver the loco [...] based largely on <b>standard</b> <b>components</b> [...] more quickly than domestic suppliers, [...] who had a backlog of orders, caused by a national engineering dispute over the 8hour working day resulting in a lock-out by employers from July 1897 and January 1898. After construction by Baldwin, the loco was shipped across the Atlantic in parts, and re-assembled at Pilton by railway staff. It first steamed in July 1898. The Manning Wardles were delivered ahead of the lock-out, and Yeo and Taw {{were used in the}} final stages of construction. Exe was stored locally in a stable, where she received the unwelcome attention of thieves who stole various brass fittings and fixtures.|$|E
2500|$|CMGs {{were used}} for {{attitude}} control on the Salyut and Mir space stations, where they were called gyrodynes (from the Russian гиродин girodin; this word is also sometimes used [...] especially by Russian crew [...] for the CMGs on the ISS). They were first tested on Salyut 3 in 1974, and introduced as <b>standard</b> <b>components</b> from Salyut 6 onwards. The completed Mir station had twelve gyrodynes altogether, starting with six in the pressurised interior of the Kvant-1 module. These were later supplemented by another six on the unpressurised outside of Kvant-2. According to NPO Energia, putting them outside {{turned out to be}} a mistake, as it made gyrodyne replacement much more difficult.|$|E

2500|$|The {{system was}} lightweight, with {{stations}} designed for trains {{of only a}} single articulated vehicle. The three branches totalled , had 15 stations, and were connected by a flat triangular junction near [...] Services ran from Tower Gateway to Island Gardens and from Stratford to Island Gardens; {{the north side of}} the junction was used only for access to the depot at Poplar. The stations were mostly of a common design and constructed from <b>standard</b> <b>components.</b> A common feature was a short half-cylindrical glazed blue canopy. All stations were above ground and were generally unstaffed, although later extension included stations below ground which were required by law to be staffed in case of evacuation.|$|E
2500|$|A 55 degree raked {{windshield}} {{was made}} of safety glass, while the license plate holder was set back in the trunk, covered with a plastic window. Underneath the new body material were <b>standard</b> <b>components</b> from Chevrolet's regular car line, including the [...] "Blue Flame" [...] inline six-cylinder engine, two-speed Powerglide automatic transmission, and drum brakes. The engine's output, , was increased however from a Carter triple-carburetor system exclusive to the Corvette, but performance of the car was decidedly [...] "lackluster". Compared to the British and Italian sports cars of the day, the Corvette lacked a manual transmission and required more effort to bring to a stop, but like their British competition, such as Morgan, was not fitted with roll-up windows; this {{would have to wait}} until sometime in the 1956 model year. A Paxton centrifugal supercharger became available in 1954 as a dealer-installed option, greatly improving the Corvette's straight-line performance, but sales continued to decline.|$|E
