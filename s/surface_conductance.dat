The main concern of the present work is about considering the heat transfer behaviour for liquid foods for which a cylindrical shape container of brass metal have taken, in this work the transient Time-Temperature relation is utilized to calculate the value of convection heat transfer coefficient (h) for each measured temperature at the centre of the cylinder (r¬¬o= 0).

40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>surface</b> <b>conductance</b> {{and its role}} in the {{interpretation}} of the formation resistivity factor of reservoir ocks is reviewed. The specific <b>surface</b> <b>conductance</b> of a clay is determined for four narrow particle-size fractions of sodium Wyoming bentonite in conductivity water. The values are derived from the specific conductance of gels of these clays {{on the basis of the}} picture of an idealized cubic network structure of the clay plates. The average <b>surface</b> <b>conductance</b> for internal and external surfaces of the bentonites i found to be 3. 2 X 10 - 9 ohm- 1, which is 0. 55 • the value expected when all exchangeable ions are assigned their infinite dilution mobility. The data are independent of particle size. In addition, conductivity data are presented for clay suspensions in a wide range of con-centrations. In extremely dilute suspensions, the contribution of the clay to the conductiv-ity when expressed per unit weight of clay (the so-called "weight conductance") is smaller than expected from an independent movement of particle and counter ions. This is inter-preted to be partly a result of both electrophoretic and relaxation retardation, indicating that the electrical double layer on sodium bentonite has a condensed character. Probably part of the counter ions are entirely immobilized by adsorption on the surface. With increasing clay concentration, further compression of the double layer increases the retardation effects and a further decrease of the weight conductance is observed. A mini-mum is reached at a concentration of a few tenths of one percent clay at which, according to viscosity and light absorption data, particle interaction becomes apparent. At this point, immobilization of the particles and bridging between the electrodes gradually eliminate the retardation effects, and <b>surface</b> <b>conductance</b> takes over.
