5|$|Collisions with <b>ships</b> <b>are</b> a {{major cause}} of mortality. In some areas, they cause a {{substantial}} portion of large whale strandings. Most serious injuries are caused by large, fast-moving ships over or near continental shelves.|$|E
5000|$|In all, twenty <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> {{built for}} the Soviet Navy, one <b>ship</b> (...) <b>was</b> later {{transferred}} to Poland, while five similar <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> built to a modified design for the Indian Navy as the Rajput class.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> {{laid down}} on 21 October 2008 at the Nordic Yards Wismar in Wismar, Germany with the yard number 147. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> {{launched}} as Cynthia on 27 January 2009 and work was completed on the vessel on 1 May 2010. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> renamed Amorito in 2010.

5|$|Capesize <b>ships</b> <b>are</b> {{too large}} to {{traverse}} the Panama canal and must round Cape Horn to travel between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Earlier, capesize ships could not traverse the Suez and needed {{to go around the}} Cape of Good Hope. Recent deepening of the Suez canal to 66ft (20m) permits most capesize ships to pass through it.|$|E

50|$|A {{total of}} 68 <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> built by Nikolayev yards (20 ships), Komsomolsk na Amure (7 ships) and Kaliningrad (the lead yard 41 <b>ships).</b> Most <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> {{decommissioned}} by 1980, however some {{were sold to}} China. The programme was cut short by Nikita Khrushchev in 1956 as the <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> becoming obsolete and the last <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> completed in 1959.|$|R
50|$|During {{the summer}} months of 2008, a {{competition}} for naming the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> held. Since the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> never delivered to Viking Line, {{the winner of the}} contest and the final name of the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> never published.|$|R

5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} {{the crew of the}} Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise-D. In this episode, the Enterprise pursue a Ferengi starship to the planet Gamma Tauri IV, where both <b>ships</b> <b>are</b> disabled by an unknown power drain. Away teams from each vessel beam down to the planet where they find an automated system left behind by the Tkon Empire.|$|E
5|$|Ship – Ships {{can be used}} as {{hospital}} ships, mostly {{operated by}} national military services, although some <b>ships</b> <b>are</b> operated by charities. They can meet the definition of ambulances as they provide transport to the sick and wounded (along with treatment). They are often sent to disaster or war zones to provide care for the casualties of these events.|$|E
5|$|Small <b>ships</b> <b>are</b> {{built in}} a ship yard while the larger ships require a space dock for construction. Ships range from the small Scoutship (used to {{discover}} new asteroids), to the gigantic Command Cruiser (which is used for transporting combat fleets over vast distances that they would otherwise be unable to travel without refueling).|$|E

50|$|As HMS Adventure the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> {{deployed}} for 5 {{years between}} 1826 and 1830 {{in a survey}} of Patagonia, under the command of Captain Phillip King. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> accompanied by HMS Beagle. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> sold in 1853.|$|R
50|$|Barrack <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> common {{during the}} era of sailing ships when shore {{facilities}} were scarce or non-existent. Barrack <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> usually hulks. At times, barrack <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> also used as prison ships for convicts, prisoners of war or civilian internees.|$|R
5|$|Some {{of these}} {{approximately}} 500 abandoned ships were used at times as storeships, saloons and hotels; many {{were left to}} rot and some were sunk to establish title to the underwater lot. By 1851 the harbor was extended out into the bay by wharves while buildings were erected on piles among the ships. By 1870 Yerba Buena Cove had been filled to create new land. Buried <b>ships</b> <b>are</b> occasionally exposed when foundations are dug for new buildings.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Navy {{has stated}} that the {{carriers}} could withstand three times the damage sustained by the Essex class inflicted by Japanese air attacks during World War II. The hangars on the <b>ships</b> <b>are</b> divided into three fire bays by thick steel doors {{that are designed to}} restrict the spread of fire. This addition has been present on U.S. aircraft carriers since World War II, after the fires caused by Kamikaze attacks.|$|E
5|$|The {{proliferation}} of ironclad battleship designs {{came to an}} end in the 1890s as navies reached a consensus on the design of battleships, producing the type known as the pre-Dreadnought. These <b>ships</b> <b>are</b> sometimes covered in treatments of the ironclad warship. The next evolution of battleship design, the dreadnought, is never referred to as an 'ironclad'.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ships</b> <b>were</b> {{sometimes}} camouflaged {{in classical}} times. Mediterranean pirate <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> sometimes painted blue-gray for concealment. Vegetius records that Julius Caesar's scout <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> painted bluish-green when gathering intelligence {{along the coast}} of Britain during the Gallic Wars. <b>Ships</b> <b>were</b> sometimes painted deceptively during the Age of Sail, while both sides in the American Civil War camouflaged their ships, whether to run blockades or for night reconnaissance.|$|R

5|$|According to Expanded Universe material, the {{peaceful}} Mon Calamari converted their passenger liners into warships {{to support the}} rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Expanded Universe texts state that the <b>ships</b> <b>are</b> crewed almost entirely by Mon Calamari due to the ships' Mon Calamari-oriented controls and interface. The primary opponent of Mon Calamari cruisers are the Imperial Star Destroyers. Although Mon Calamari cruisers are roughly {{the same size as}} most Imperial Destroyers, in head-to-head engagements the Mon Calamari cruisers are usually at a disadvantage, due to their thinner armor. Even so, Mon Calamari cruisers are still a formidable threat to the Imperial fleet; their large numbers of fighter squadrons, modular weapons systems and overlapping shields make them ideal for hit-and-run attacks on Imperial ships, bases, and military outposts.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, T'Pol {{returns to}} her cabin and is {{surprised}} to find Rajiin inside. She tries to resist, but is soon overcome. Rajiin attempts to flee using the transporter, but is quickly captured {{and placed in the}} brig. As Archer attempts to question her, Lieutenant Reed informs him that two Reptilian <b>ships</b> <b>are</b> on an intercept course. Rajiin admits she was gathering information for the Xindi. Reptilians, after running battles with the crew, retrieve Rajiin and take her back to one of the ships. Enterprise attempts to pursue, but the Xindi enters a subspace vortex. Afterwards, the Council convenes again to discuss the development and construction of a new bio-weapon, a project helped by Archer's bio-data that was stolen by Rajiin.|$|E
5|$|All {{the three}} ships {{of the class}} were {{constructed}} at the Mazagon Dock Limited. The construction of the lead ship, Shivalik, commenced in December 2000. The ship's keel was laid in July 2001 and was launched in April 2003. It underwent sea trials in February 2009 before being commissioned in April 2010. The second ship, Satpura, was laid in October 2002. It was launched in June 2004 and commissioned in August 2011. The third and final ship, Sahyadri, was laid in September 2003, launched in May 2005 and commissioned in July 2012. All the three <b>ships</b> <b>are</b> named after hill-ranges in India: Shivalik after the Sivalik Hills, Satpura after the Satpura range and Sahyadri after the Sahyadri range commonly called Western Ghats.|$|E

50|$|Initially four <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> {{planned to}} be ordered in 1959 to 1961. These <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> to be named Circe, Climene, Perseo and Polluce in honour of the World War II-era s of those names. These <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> {{postponed}} while the designs were updated and two <b>ships</b> <b>were</b> ordered in 1962. Both vessels were built by CNR in Riva Trigoso and named after types of soldiers and specifically after two World War II s.|$|R
25|$|After Walnuts {{arrival in}} Halifax, the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> {{detained}} at the French Cable Wharf in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> sold by auction {{to pay for}} expenses from the voyage. During the protracted legal process surrounding her refugee passengers, the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> stripped of its brass fittings by thieves and scuttled in shallow water in Dartmouth. The <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> sold at another auction in 1951 and rebuilt by the Quebec firm Borromee Verreault. Walnut was renamed Keta and worked on the St. Lawrence River and Canadian Arctic until the <b>ship</b> <b>was</b> scrapped in 1975.|$|R
