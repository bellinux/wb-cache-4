Scanner drift was tracked with a known stable reference material, Standard Reference Material (SRM) 2242. The greatest effect on the figures of merit was the dye, with the Cy 5 dye showing signs of degradation after one week of scanning independent of all other factors while the Cy 3 dye remained relatively stable.

Those two processes are repeated until extreme dilutions are reached, so that the chemical composition of the end solution is identical to that of the solvent. We measured the heats of mixing and the electrical conductivity of basic solutions of such EDS, and compared these results with the analogous heats of mixing and electrical conductivity of the untreated solvent. The measurements were carried out as a function of the age of the samples. We found some relevant exothermic excess heat of mixing, and higher electrical conductivity than those of the untreated solvent, also in function of time. The measurements show a good linear correlation between the two independent physico-chemical quantities, implying a single cause for this behavior of the extremely diluted solutions. The slopes of the linear correlation depend on the age of the EDS. Such a phenomenon could result from a variation of the shape of molecular aggregates that characterize the two different supramolecular structures of the water of different ages. This behavior could provide important support for understanding the nature of the phenomena described herein. A really intriguing phenomenon is the evolution of some physico-chemical properties with time.

40|$|Purpose :There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in the characterization of the particle size of sediment due to its impact on particle dynamics, especially for connectivity purpose. This study determined the particle size distribution of suspended sediment in a mountainous catchment, with the aim to evaluate the variability of particle size during floods, the main controlling factors, and if indirect information from hillslopes was useful for the interpretation of particle size measured at the catchment outlet. This work involved {{the development of a}} measurement protocol. Material and methods Samples were collected automatically from streamwater during flood events using an ISCO 3700 sampler. Five events were analyzed for their particle size distributions using a Malvern Mastersizer 2000. Because the samples were too concentrated, two different protocols were tested to address the errors made during the subsampling step: using a pipette and a home-made device with <b>successive</b> <b>dilution</b> phases. Results and discussion High errors occurred when using a pipette to extract particles within a stirred sample. The maximum errors were reduced from 1, 600 to 30 % using the device described within this study. Particles were found to be aggregated at various levels regardless of the discharge they were sampled at. Their size was found to be either variable or stable at the event scale, and statistical analyses revealed that discharge was the factor that best correlated with particle size. The results obtained in this study are in agreement with the few other studies in comparable environments. Some hypothesis are put forward and discussed to explain the positive relationship between particle size and discharge. Input from hillslopes seems to have a measureable effect in this headwater catchment. Conclusions While the need for in situ measurements has long been stressed in lowland rivers, estuaries, and coastal environments, it was shown that the use of an accurate dilution protocol could provide some physically interpretable measurements on the particle size distributions of suspended sediment transported in a mountainous catchment. It also appears that hillslope information has to be considered when studying particle size measured at the catchment outlet...|$|R
40|$|Automated {{nucleic acid}} {{extraction}} {{is an attractive}} alternative to labor-intensive manual methods. We compared two automated methods, the BioRobot M 48 instrument (Qiagen, Inc.) and MagNA Pure (Roche Applied Sciences) methods, to two manual methods, the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen) and TRIzol (Invitrogen), for the extraction of enterovirus RNA. Analytical sensitivity was assessed by dilution analysis of poliovirus type 2 Sabin in cerebrospinal fluid. The sensitivity of PCR was equivalent after RNA extraction with QIAamp, BioRobot M 48, and MagNA Pure. All 18 replicates of 100 PFU/ml were detected after extraction by the four methods. Fewer replicates of each <b>successive</b> <b>dilution</b> were detected after extraction by each method. At 10 − 1 PFU/ml, 17 of 18 replicates were positive by QIAamp, 15 of 18 replicates were positive by BioRobot M 48, and 12 of 18 replicates were positive by MagNA Pure; at 10 − 2 PFU/ml, 4 of 17 replicates were positive by QIAamp, 2 of 18 replicates were positive by BioRobot M 48, and 0 of 18 replicates were positive by MagNA Pure. At 10 − 3 PFU/ml, no replicates were detected. Evaluation of TRIzol was discontinued after nine replicates due to a trend of lower sensitivity (at 10 − 3 PFU/ml eight of nine replicates were positive at 100 PFU/ml, four of nine replicates were positive at 10 − 1 PFU/ml, and zero of nine replicates were positive at 10 − 2 PFU/ml). Concordant results were obtained in 24 of 28 clinical specimens after extraction by all methods. No evidence of contamination was observed after extraction by automated instruments. The data indicate that the sensitivity of enterovirus PCR is largely similar after extraction by QIAamp, BioRobot M 48, and MagNA Pure; a trend of decreased sensitivity was observed after TRIzol extraction. However, the results of enterovirus PCR were largely concordant in patient samples, indicating that the four extraction methods are suitable for detection of enteroviruses in clinical specimens...|$|R
