50|$|The short-distanced {{right field}} fence at the Polo Grounds was a {{frequent}} target of long drives hit by Robertson and his Giants' teammate, Benny Kauff. Their hits to right field became so much of an issue that National League officials convened following the 1916 baseball season. Baseball officials decided to amend Rule #1, which read the <b>shortest</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> a fence or stand on fair territory to the home base should be 235 feet. The amendment to the rule changed the <b>shortest</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> a stand or fence to 270 feet.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the flat}} {{topography}} of Essex County, the land use surrounding Highway77 is almost entirely agricultural. Soil conditions in Essex are ideal for farming, {{and as a result}} very few natural areas {{can be found in the}} county. Many streams have been diverted to irrigate the endless farmland to either side of the highway. Relief from the plain is provided only by the few hamlets along the route. In addition, Lake Erie and Lake St Clair are both a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> Highway 77.|$|E

5|$|The route {{was once}} part of the Jordan and Skaneateles Plank Road, a plank road {{established}} by a New York State Legislature charter in the 1850s. It spanned a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> Jordan {{to the village of}} Skaneateles and was a successor to the Auburn and Syracuse Railroad, which ceased operations in 1834. However, the plank road lasted less than two decades. In 1866, the Legislature granted another charter, this time creating the Skaneateles Railroad and its corporation, which bought out most of the plank road company.|$|E
5|$|A few {{accounts}} {{exist that}} describe females defending their newborn litters. Wharten (1960, 1966) reported several cases where females found near their young stood their ground and considered these to be examples of guarding behavior. Another case {{was described by}} Walters and Card (1996) in which a female was found {{at the entrance of}} a chamber with seven neonates crawling on or around her. When one of the young was moved a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> the chamber, she seemed to be agitated and faced the intruder. Eventually, all of her offspring retreated into the chamber, but the female remained at the entrance, ready to strike.|$|E
5|$|Free {{from any}} {{constitutional}} duties {{during the time}} between sessions, Chandler had begun laying the groundwork to succeed Laffoon as governor almost {{from the beginning of}} his term as lieutenant governor. Laffoon, however, had {{made it clear that he}} favored Thomas Rhea to be his successor. Rhea secured the services of rising political boss Earle C. Clements as his campaign manager. Hailing from Morganfield, only a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> Chandler's hometown of Corydon, Clements later said that if Chandler had asked him first, he might have managed Chandler's campaign instead of Rhea's. Instead, by virtue of managing the opposing campaign, Clements became the leader of a Democratic faction that opposed Chandler for the next three decades.|$|E
30|$|Single source {{shortest}} path (SSSP) [10] {{is the problem}} of finding the <b>shortest</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> a source node to all other nodes in a graph. Given a weighted, directed graph G = (V, E, W), where V is the set of nodes, E is the set of edges, and W(i, j) is the weight of edge from node i to node j. The <b>shortest</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> the source node s to each node u in the graph is computed iteratively using Dijkstra’s algorithm [34]. Initially, the distance of the source node is set to 0 (i.e., d(s) = 0), and the minimum <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> s to any other nodes is set to ∞ (i.e., d(u) = ∞).|$|R

5|$|In {{the weeks}} and months after {{conclusion}} of the Inquiry one possible explanation of the crash began to circulate among employees of ANA. This possibility began with one piece of evidence uncovered by the Inquiry during cross-examination of ANA's ground staff. It was reported that after sunrise the morning after the crash the one-gallon container used to check Amana's fuel filters was found empty and lying on its side on the apron a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> where Amana had been parked. The Inquiry attached no significance to this evidence and did not explore it further.|$|E

Lownds feared that NVA infiltrators were mixed up in the crowd of more than 6,000, and lacked sufficient resources to sustain them. Overnight, they were moved to a temporary position a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> the perimeter and from there some of the Laotians were eventually evacuated, although the majority turned around and walked back down Route 9 toward Laos.|$|E

The Crucible Theatre is the home (since 1977) of the World Snooker Championships and hosts many well-known stage productions throughout the year. The Lyceum, which opened in 1897, serves as a venue for touring West End productions and operas by Opera North, as well as locally produced shows. Sheffield also has the Montgomery Theatre, a small 420 seater theatre located a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> <b>from</b> Tudor Square, opposite the town hall on Surrey Street.
