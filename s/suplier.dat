The variables analyzed were supply chain and efficiency. There are three indicators in the supply chain variables, namely (1) the pattern of supply chain, (2) marketing margin and (3) the pattern of the value chain. While the efficiency variables consists of two indicators: (1) technical efficiency index and (2) economic efficiency index.

Beside that, aquatic plants also economically potencial, such as sources of chlorophyll, carotenoid and vitamin C. The aim of this experiment is to analize the content of total chlorophyll, carotenoids and vitamin C in 13 species of aquatic plants. It is expected that these plants maybe used for commercial purposes. The plants were collected from Rawa Pening, Genuk stream, and brackish water shrim pond in Kendal and Jepara. These chemical analysis were done by spectrophotometer, whereas vitamin C content was measured using iodometric titration method. Results indicated that the highest content of chlorophyl was resulted by Ipomoea aquatica, which is 22, 1 mg/L. The highest content of carotenodid and vitamin C is resulted by Nymphaea sp., which were 3, 42 mg/L and 14, 1 mg/ 30 g respectively.

It is defined as the totality of characteristics of an entity that bear on its ability to satisfy stated and implied needs. Needs may change with time, which implies a permanent review of requirements for quality. It is crucial that these requirements fully reflect the customer's needs. Quality is often equated with usability ("fitness for use"), functionality, customer satisfaction, or conformity with generally accepted standards and requirements. Service.
