2500|$|The {{introduction}} of congestion pricing {{was one of}} a number of anti-congestion policies implemented in Singapore since the 1970s, in recognition of the country's land constraints, need of economic competitiveness, and to avoid the traffic gridlock that chokes many cities in the world. One key aspect of demand management in Singapore is the restraint of vehicle ownership, either through the imposition of high ownership costs or restriction on the actual growth of the car population. [...] These measures have included high annual road tax, custom duties and vehicle registration fees. Besides fiscal deterrents, supply of motor vehicles was regulated since 1990, when a Vehicle Quota System was introduced. These high initial buy-in charges are considered as the price motorists pay for the luxury of owning a car and to cover part of the fixed costs associated with scaling basic road infrastructure. Then, use-related charges, such as fuel taxes (50% of final sale price), ALS or high parking rates are utilised by public authorities to further constraint travel. In parallel to the whole spectrum of road pricing measures, the government has invested heavily in public transport and implemented a park-and-ride scheme, with thirteen fringe car parks, hence providing car users a real alternative to <b>switch</b> <b>travel</b> modes.

A combined choice and latent variable model has been developed, in which the individual traveler's risk aversion has been modeled as a latent variable.

40|$|Understanding the {{dynamics}} of time allocation by households and their household members is becoming increasingly important for travel demand forecasting. A unique opportunity to understand day-to-day and year-to-year behavioral change, is provided by data from multi-day travel diaries combined with yearly observation of the same individuals over time (panel surveys). In fact, the "repeated" nature of the data allows to distinguish units that over time change their behavior from {{those that are not}} and to uncover the underlying stochastic behavior generating the data. In this paper data from the Puget Sound Transportation Panel (PSTP) are analyzed to identify change in the patterns of time allocation by the panel participants (i. e., patterns of activity participation and travel). The data analyzed are sequences of states in categorical data from reported individuals' daily activity participation and travel indicators. This is done separately for activity participation and trip making using probabilistic models that generalize the restrictive Markov chain models by incorporating unobserved variables of change. The PSTP data analysis here suggests the more likely presence of multiple paths of change for time allocation to activities, non-stationary switching of activity participation from one year to the next, and day-to-day stationarity in activity participation pattern <b>switching.</b> <b>Travel</b> pattern change is best explained by a single path of change with stationary day-to-day pattern transition probabilities that are different from their year-to-year counterparts. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTraffic {{congestion}} and transportation-related environmental pollution {{are identified as}} the severe problems in many countries all over the world, especially in the developing countries, and Vietnam is also not an exception. In the context of Ho Chi Minh City, the biggest city located in Southern in Vietnam, millions of student and employee annually immigrate there to live, work and study; therefore, encouraging them to use bus service to reduce pressure on urban environment and traffic and transport is significant. The goal {{of this study was}} to recognize the behaviour of mode choice among student and employee using disaggregate model. To achieve this goal, binary logit model was used under disaggregate choice method. The findings indicated that, for student, ‘Gender’, ‘Motorcycle ownership’, ‘Travel time’, ‘Travel distance’, ‘Migrant status’, ‘Convenience’, ‘Safety’, and ‘Awareness’ affected their mode choices; for employee, ‘Married’, ‘Income’, ‘Children’, ‘House ownership’, ‘Motorcycle ownership’, ‘Migrant status’, ‘Travel cost’, ‘Travel distance’, ‘Convenience’, ‘Safety’, ‘Awareness’, and ‘Social norms’ played vital roles in their choices of means of transport. Besides, although motorcycle was the premier transport mode for both employee and student every day, they showed their perceptions of the negative sides of motorcycle to environment and community, and also expressed their willingness to <b>switch</b> to <b>travel</b> by bus if public transportation infrastructure and quality were upgraded...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Active {{commuting}} {{is associated}} with various health benefits, but {{little is known about}} its causal relationship with body mass index (BMI). METHODS We used cohort data from three consecutive annual waves of the British Household Panel Survey, a longitudinal study of nationally representative households, in 2004 / 05 (n= 15, 791), 2005 / 06 and 2006 / 07. Participants selected for the analyses (n= 4, 056) reported their usual main mode of travel to work at each time point. Self-reported height and weight were used to derive BMI at baseline and after two years. Multivariable linear regression analyses were used to assess associations between switching to and from active modes of travel (over one and two years) and change in BMI (over two years) and to assess dose-response relationships. RESULTS After adjustment for socioeconomic and health-related covariates, the first analysis (n= 3, 269) showed that switching from private motor transport to active travel or public transport (n= 179) was associated with a significant reduction in BMI compared to continued private motor vehicle use (n= 3, 090) (- 0. 32 kg/m 2, 95 % CI: - 0. 60 to - 0. 05). Larger adjusted effect sizes were associated with <b>switching</b> to active <b>travel</b> (n= 109) (- 0. 45 kg/m 2, - 0. 78 to - 0. 11), particularly among those who switched within the first year and those with the longest journeys. The second analysis (n= 787) showed that <b>switching</b> from active <b>travel</b> or public transport to private motor transport was associated with a significant increase in BMI (0. 34 kg/m 2, 0. 05 to 0. 64). CONCLUSION Interventions to enable commuters to switch from private motor transport to more active modes of travel could contribute to reducing population mean BMI...|$|R
