40|$|Objectives. We {{examined}} whether {{sexual minority}} students living in <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>cities</b> with more protective school climates were at {{lower risk of}} suicidal thoughts, plans, and attempts. Methods. Data on sexual orientation and past-year suicidal thoughts, plans, and attempts were from the pooled 2005 and 2007 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Surveys from 8 <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>cities.</b> We derived data on school climates that protected sexual minority students (e. g., percentage of schools with safe spaces and Gay–Straight Alliances) from the 2010 School Health Profile Survey, compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Results. Lesbian, gay, and bisexual students living in <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>cities</b> with more protective school climates reported fewer past-year suicidal thoughts than those living in <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>cities</b> with less protective climates (lesbians and gays: odds ratio [OR][*]=[*] 0. 68; 95 % confidence interval [CI][*]=[*] 0. 47, 0. 99; bisexuals: OR[*]=[*] 0. 81; 95 % CI[*]=[*] 0. 66, 0. 99). Results were robust to adjustment for potential state-level confounders. Sexual orientation disparities in suicidal thoughts were nearly eliminated in <b>states</b> <b>and</b> <b>cities</b> with the most protective school climates. Conclusions. School climates that protect sexual minority students may reduce their risk of suicidal thoughts...|$|R

5|$|The first {{railway station}} {{to be built}} in Trondheim was located at Kalvskinnet, to serve the narrow gauge Trondhjem–Støren Line railway that was {{completed}} in 1864. The station was designed by Georg Andreas Bull, and still exists as a synagogue. In 1877 the <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>city</b> made an agreement to build a new station at Brattøra to serve the new Meråker Line that was being built to Sweden. Brattøra was chosen because it was located directly beside the port, and would allow direct transshipment from ships to the railway of both goods and passengers. The station would become the main station for both railways; this caused a major protest among the local population, who felt it was necessary to have two terminal stations, one for each line, and the city brought the matter before the courts—the case was settled in 1895 in favor of one station. The lack of planning and coordination between the two lines made the new station a large budget cost for the Meråker Line; and described as one of few exceptions to the small-and-cheap policy dominating the state railways i Norway at the time.|$|E
