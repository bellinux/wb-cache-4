This work discusses {{the influence of}} <b>spray</b> <b>torch</b> and feedstock powder selection on the microstructure and high-stress abrasion resistance of thermally sprayed Cr 3 C 2 -NiCr coatings. Four commercial feedstock powders with spherical morphology were deposited by different high-velocity spray processes, namely third generation gas- and liquid fuelled HVOF-torches and by the latest generation HVAF-torch. The microstructures of the coatings were studied in the as-sprayed state and after various heat treatments. The high-stress abrasion resistance of as-sprayed and heat treated coatings was tested at room temperature and at 800 °C. The study reveals that {{the selection of the}} <b>spray</b> <b>torch</b> mainly affects the room temperature abrasion resistance of the as-sprayed coatings, which is due to differences in the embrittlement of the binder phase generated by carbide dissolution. At elevated temperatures, precipitation and growth of secondary carbides yields a fast equalization of the various coatings microstructures and wear properties...|$|E

The resulting plasma jet instabilities affect the treatment (heat and momentum) of particles injected in the plasma flow and, thus, the coating quality. However, {{it is not clear}} if the experimentally observed fluctuations of particle temperatures are a major phenomena and if their frequencies are always in unison with those of voltage. In this study, two online techniques are used to investigate, respectively, the time variation of particle temperatures and its correlation with voltage variations; the first technique makes it possible to analyze plasma voltage instabilities and the second one to investigate those of particle temperatures. Both allow determining the frequencies and amplitude variations of voltage and particle temperature. Experiments were carried out with three plasma torches (F 4 -type and two 3 MB-type) using, respectively, argon-hydrogen (F 4 -type and 3 MB) and nitrogen-hydrogen (3 MB) mixtures (all with restrike mode for the voltage fluctuations) as plasma-forming gases. A good correlation between arc voltage and particle temperature fluctuations is observed when the plasma torch is operated with argon-hydrogen mixtures and high mass flow rate.

Anode erosion in plasma <b>spray</b> <b>torches</b> results in coating deterioration. The usable life of a torch anode is strongly dependent on the fluid dynamic behavior of the plasma inside the torch, which in turn depends on the geometric design of the anode and the operating parameters. To study the relative importance of these effects, cold flow investigations have been performed with a torch having a glass anode with the same geometric dimensions as a commercial plasma torch. The density differences between the arc and the cold gas were simulated by injecting heated helium from the tip of the cathode into the cold argon gas flow from the regular gas injector. Flow visualization was achieved by seeding the flow with micron-sized particles. A finite-element computational fluid dynamics code was used to simulate the cold flow structure. The results were compared with erosion patterns observed with an actual plasma torch.

40|$|International audienceSuspension plasma {{spraying}} (SPS) {{is an alternative}} to conventional atmospheric {{plasma spraying}} (APS) aiming at manufacturing thinner layers (i. e., 10 - 100 lm) due to the specific size of the feedstock particles, from a few tens of nanometers to a few micrometers. The staking of lamellae and particles, which present a diameter ranging from 0. 1 to 2. 0 lm and an average thickness from 20 to 300 nm, permits to manufacture finely structured layers. Moreover, it appears as a versatile process able to manufacture different coating architectures according to the operating parameters (suspension properties, injection configuration, plasma properties, <b>spray</b> distance, <b>torch</b> scan velocity, scanning step, etc.). However, the different parameters controlling {{the properties of the}} coating, and their interdependences, are not yet fully identified. Thus, the aim of this paper is, on the one hand, to better understand the influence of operating parameters on the coating manufacturing mechanisms (in particular, the plasma gas mixture effect) and, on the other hand, to produce Al 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 finely structured layers with large varieties of architectures. For this purpose, a simple theoretical model was used to describe the plasma torch operating conditions at the nozzle exit, based on experimental data (mass enthalpy, arc current intensity, thermophysical properties of plasma forming gases, etc.) and the influences of the spray parameters were determined by mean of the study of sizes and shapes of spray beads. The results enabled then to reach a better understanding of involved phenomena and their interactions on the final coating architectures permitting to manufacture several types of microstructures...|$|R
40|$|Liquid {{atomization}} {{is applied}} in nanostructure dense coating technology to inject suspended nano-size powder materials into a suspension plasma <b>spray</b> (SPS) <b>torch.</b> This paper presents {{the effects of}} the atomization parameters on the nanoparticle processing. A numerical model was developed to simulate the dynamic behaviors of the suspension droplets, the solid nanoparticles or agglomerates, as well as the interactions between them and the plasma gas. The plasma gas was calculated as compressible, multi-component, turbulent jet flow in Eulerian scheme. The droplets and the solid particles were calculated as discrete Lagrangian entities, being tracked through the spray process. The motion and thermal histories of the particles were given in this paper and their release and melting status were observed. The key parameters of atomization, including droplet size, injection angle and velocity were also analyzed. The study revealed that the nanoparticle processing in SPS preferred small droplets with better atomization and less aggregation from suspension preparation. The injection angle and velocity influenced the nanoparticle release percentage. Small angle and low initial velocity might have more nanoparticles released. Besides, the melting percentage of nanoparticles and agglomerates were studied, and the critical droplet diameter to ensure solid melting was drawn. Results showed that most released nanoparticles were well melted, but the agglomerates might be totally melted, partially melted, or even not melted at all, mainly depending on the agglomerate size. For better coating quality, the suspension droplet size should be limited to a critical droplet diameter, which was inversely proportional to the cubic root of weight content, for given critical agglomerate diameter of being totally melted...|$|R
