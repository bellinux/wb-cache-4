50|$|The {{method used}} {{to lock the}} drum against the device frame is {{by the use of}} two <b>straight</b> <b>knurl</b> edge discs that are thrown {{outwards}} by centrifugal force as they ride on parallel ramps milled into the drum's enclosed outer periphery. Two light return springs act as centrifugal force trips and as return springs to reset the discs when the fall load is released and the device is unlocked. A simple nylon guide is used to ensure both discs activate simultaneously to jam the discs between each drum ramp and the frame's lock ring.|$|E
