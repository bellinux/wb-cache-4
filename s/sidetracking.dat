25|$|Another debated {{case was}} {{regarding}} {{the presence of}} Camillo Guglielmi, a colonel of SISMI's 7th Division which controlled Operation Gladio, in via Stresa near {{the location of the}} ambush, and in those exact minutes when the BR kidnapped Moro. His presence was kept secret and was only disclosed in 1990 during the investigation of the Italian Parliament commission on State Massacres. Guglielmi admitted that he was in via Stresa, but only because he had been invited to lunch by a colleague. According to several sources the colleague confirmed that Guglielmi came to his house, but had not been invited. Furthermore, Italians normally have lunch at around 12:30 and Guglielmi's presence at around 09:00 AM would be not justified. Other sources list Guglielmi as a true member of Gladio, but the officer always firmly denied this accusation. His direct superior, general Pietro Musumeci, was a member of P2 and condemned for <b>sidetracking</b> the investigations on the 1980 Bologna Station bombing.|$|E

2500|$|Chichiarelli, {{the author}} of the false [...] "Communication No.7", was related to the Banda della Magliana. Aside from its purely {{criminal}} activities this large gang in Rome was related to Sicilian Mafia and has been involved in numerous political and terrorist scandals since the 1970s. Judiciary acts have proved that members of the gang had a role in the assassination of Pecorelli {{and in the case of}} Roberto Calvi (both of which saw the incrimination of Giulio Andreotti), in the financial affairs of the Vatican City (including the kidnapping of Emanuela Orlandi), and in the <b>sidetracking</b> of the investigations on massacres such as that of Bologna Station. Judge Ferdinando Imposimato proved that the [...] "Banda della Magliana" [...] had strong ties with SISMI (Italy's military intelligence agency), and that the latter inspired the farce of the communication and of the Lago della Duchessa. Finally, the apartment of via Montalcini, in which Moro was allegedly detained by the Red Brigades, was located in the Magliana quarter of southern Rome and a member of the gang owned the building facing that apartment.|$|E
2500|$|GameSpy's Matthew Freeman {{scored the}} GameCube version 3 out of 5, writing [...] "Sierra has {{produced}} an adventure {{that allows for}} enough puzzling, <b>sidetracking,</b> and combat for both gamers that love the book, and gamers who only love a fun game. The younger crowds and Tolkien fanatics will find a lot to like here, but veteran gamers may feel as if they're in all too familiar territory." [...] Dan Bennett was less impressed with the PC version, scoring it 2 out of 5. He wrote [...] "The Hobbit is {{just as likely to}} disappoint big-time Tolkien fans as its troubled gameplay is likely to disappoint the average gamer." [...] He felt the game failed to appeal specifically to younger gamers, adults or Tolkien fans; [...] "The Hobbit is a game that doesn't know what audience it's going for. Its look and feel is too juvenile for adults, and some of its challenges are too difficult and frustrating for kids. Even rabid Tolkien fans won't care for the game, thanks to its translation of the classic novel into a lightweight, cartoonish platformer. It has a few redeeming qualities, but it's a sad waste of great source material." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Missing pay {{sections}} in faulted areas {{is a common}} occurrence. An accurate measurement of the fault plane and surrounding bed distortion can substantially reduce the risk involved in the <b>sidetrack</b> decision. The measurement of the fault plane includes the dip and strike {{as well as the}} sealing nature of the fault plane. Our experience indicates mineral-filled fault planes are always sealing. This has lead to several interesting <b>sidetracks,</b> many of which are against conventional wisdom. Case studies included show an extensional fault <b>sidetrack</b> to the downthrown block; a perforating determination based on the location of the actual sealing fault; an extensional fault <b>sidetrack</b> based on the non-sealing properties of the fault plane. In these cases the distortion of the surrounding blocks are modeled using enhanced computer techniques (Etchecopar 1992). The input of the actual fault plane dip and strike is shown to be the key to an accurate cross-sectional projection. The visualization of the fault model is critical to the resolution f the <b>sidetrack</b> azimuth and distance. Whether a fault plane is sealing is also an important contribution to any <b>sidetrack</b> analysis. This technique has accurately predicted the <b>sidetrack</b> location for many successful wells. It is not an infrequent event that a well planne...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to external hostility, {{a spirit of}} factionalism and personal strife existed within {{the ranks of the}} ANLC. The selection of Fort-Whiteman as leader by the Comintern had proven controversial, as he seemed to leapfrog long-time party activists with impeccable bona fides, including Moore, Huiswoud, and Briggs. This situation was exacerbated by Fort-Whiteman's own growing sense of self-importance, his tendency to make decisions by fiat, and his propensity to wear grandiose Russian garb. A steady stream of complaints about Fort-Whiteman to the Negro Commission of the Workers (Communist) Party followed, <b>sidetracking</b> the organization's work.|$|E
40|$|Using a {{decision}} tree and stochastic parameters, {{expected monetary value}} is calculated to evaluate optimal <b>sidetrack</b> time. In view of placing a high confidence level on analytical approach to optimal <b>sidetrack</b> time for a waterflooded reservoir based on possible uncertainty of economic and reservoir parameters and probability of <b>sidetrack</b> success, a major assumption on a parameter in a previous study is re-evaluated.

The change in the relative influence of the stochastic parameters to optimal <b>sidetrack</b> time due to re-evaluation calls for much attention with probable need to further reduce assumptions made, however insignificant the parameter may be.
