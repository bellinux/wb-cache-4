5000|$|The Baileys' journey {{began when}} they left Southampton, England, in their 31 ft yacht Auralyn. Their {{intended}} destination was New Zealand. They passed safely through the Panama Canal in February and {{were on their way}} to the Galapagos Islands. At dawn on 4 March 1973, their yacht was struck by a whale and severely damaged. After transferring some supplies to an inflated life raft and dinghy and salvaging some food, a compass, and other supplies, the Baileys watched as Auralyn disappeared beneath the waves. To survive, they collected rainwater and when their meager food supplies ran out, began eating sea creatures such as turtles, seabirds and fish caught by hand or with safety pins fashioned into hooks. As they drifted in the open Pacific, the couple saw seven different ships, but were unable to attract these ships' attention since their signal flares failed and their emergency kit did not contain a <b>signalling</b> <b>mirror.</b> Their life raft began to disintegrate and required frequent reinflation. They read and played card games early in their ordeal, but later the Baileys suffered terribly from malnutrition and friction-induced sores, the latter worsening due to the wet conditions in the raft. They encountered sharks and dolphins and had to endure several severe storms.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Future {{gravitational}} wave detectors will include {{some form of}} <b>signal</b> <b>mirror</b> in order to alter the signal response of the device. We introduce interferometer configurations which utilise a variable reflectivity <b>signal</b> <b>mirror</b> allowing a tunable peak frequency and variable signal bandwidth. A detector configuredwith a Fabry-Perot cavity as the <b>signal</b> <b>mirror</b> is compared theoretically with one using a Michelson interferometer for a <b>signal</b> <b>mirror.</b> A system for the measurement of the interferometer signal responses is introduced. This technique is applied to a power-recycled Michelson interferometer with resonant sideband extraction. We present broadband measurements of the benchtop prototype’s signal response {{for a range of}} signal cavity detunings. This technique is also applicable to most other {{gravitational wave}} detector configurations. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Additional training, {{particularly}} in locating {{small groups of}} men in camouflaged areas {{by the use of}} sunlit <b>signal</b> <b>mirrors</b> was especially important, as radio communications with commando units was not always possible. <b>Signal</b> <b>mirrors</b> and hand held airborne beacon light training in morse code was carried out for communications between the aircraft and men on the ground. [...] "Kicker" [...] training was also carried out so resupply drops would be made accurately into small clearings.|$|R

50|$|Construction of live {{landscape}} to blur a city's mountainous topography: in a mountainous city several people kilometers {{away from each}} other and in the same topographic height produced a horizontal gesture making sparkles with <b>signal</b> <b>mirrors.</b> The collaboration was requested tof inhabitants whose houses were marked under an extensive imaginary horizontal trace, that the natural landscape of the city does not have. During the action, a group of art students made signals (sparkles), from houses located in the horizontal outline with <b>signal</b> <b>mirrors</b> designed specifically for the project. The action lasted four hours and was recorded in video and photographs.|$|R
5000|$|A {{manual for}} this event was {{developed}} by the Great Salt Lake Council, was later reprinted in one of the Varsity Scout Program Helps books, and now is a chapter in the Boy Scouts of America Varsity Team Features Volume II handbook. While even small handheld mirrors, 3" [...] to 4" [...] on a side, can be seen 30 miles away, teams are encouraged to take along at least one large mirror. The classic large Operation On-Target <b>signal</b> <b>mirror</b> is a modular design with four square feet of reflecting area, transported in backpacks and assembled on-site. It consists of four 12"x12" [...] mirrors bolted to a square of plywood with wing bolts and mounted on a light tripod. A small aimable <b>signal</b> <b>mirror</b> is taped to one edge as a sight.|$|R

25|$|Drifting in open {{seas and}} {{international}} waters, as encountered on long sea voyages and by military forces, requires prolonged survival in water. Suitable life jackets are often {{attached to a}} vest with pockets and attachment points for distress signaling and survival aids, for example, a handheld two-way radio (walkie-talkie), emergency beacon (406MHz frequency), <b>signal</b> <b>mirror,</b> sea marker dye, smoke or light signal flares, strobe light, first-aid supplies, concentrated nutritional items, water purification supplies, shark repellent, knife, and pistol.|$|R
5000|$|In {{tropical}} areas, {{a survival}} kit may have mosquito head netting, additional insect repellent, anti-fungal cream, a machete, water purification tablets, foot powder, matches, a flint strike, a compass, a wire saw, a space blanket, medical equipment (gauze pads, elastic gauze bandage, antiseptic creams, anti-malaria tablets, anti-infection tablets, bandages, etc.), salt tablets, a fishing kit, snare wire, extra socks, a candle, a <b>signal</b> <b>mirror,</b> flares, a sewing kit, safety pins, tinder, tape, a whistle, and rations.|$|R

5000|$|The 300M Special {{was offered}} {{beginning}} midyear 2002. It featured a [...] 3.5 liter engine designed to use premium (91+ octane) gasoline and producing [...] of torque, with a 3.89 final drive ratio. Performance-type dual exhaust, high-performance brakes, and 18-inch Z-rated tires were standard, with Michelin Pilot Sport 245/45R18 performance tires optional. Other standard {{features of the}} Special included premium [...] "Waterfall" [...] leather seats, <b>signal</b> <b>mirrors,</b> body cladding, and slightly lower ride height. This model also included high-intensity discharge headlamps and imitation-carbon-fiber interior trim panels that replaced the standard woodgrain trim panels.|$|R
2500|$|Operation On-Target {{events are}} now synonymous with Varsity Scouting. In {{the spring of}} 1973, the Great Salt Lake Council held a [...] "Merit Badge Expo" [...] at the University of Utah. Commissioner Glen Oliver had the idea to send a Boy Scout Troop {{to the top of}} nearby Mount Olympus with a <b>signaling</b> <b>mirror.</b> At a pre-determined time, the Scouts would signal the Expo as a {{demonstration}} {{to go along with the}} Signaling merit badge being offered. Doug Brewer was Scoutmaster of Boy Scout Troop 502, the unit that conducted this first <b>mirror</b> <b>signaling</b> activity that would later be adopted by Varsity Scouting and known as [...] "Operation On Target" [...] (to help Scouts [...] "get on target with Varsity Scouting and on target in life)". Brewer later became the first Varsity Scouting commissioner in the Great Salt Lake Council.|$|R

The scheme is suitable for quadrature SC Band-Pass (BP) Σ∆ modulators with a centre frequency at Fs/ 4 or-Fs/ 4, where it can minimize the quantization noise mirror image and where the <b>signal</b> <b>mirror</b> image can be suppressed. Furthermore, a quadrature mismatch noise shaping method {{that can be used}} with this DEM scheme is introduced. 1...|$|R
50|$|The Platinum Series 300M was {{available}} only in three exterior colors: Graphite Metallic, Bright Silver Metallic, or Brilliant Black Crystal. Other features included: deep slate/light taupe two-tone interior, chrome door handles, deep gloss black turn <b>signal</b> <b>mirrors</b> with a reverse gear auto pivot feature, and 17-inch chrome wheels. A 360-watt Infinity II Cassette/CD player, and a no-charge SIRIUS satellite radio system with a one-year SIRIUS subscription were also included. Additional features include leather seats, satin silver bezels, chrome or platinum clad wheels, and other unique interior features. These models have a special Platinum Series badging on the C pillars.|$|R
50|$|In general, {{the steps}} in jasmonate (JA) <b>signaling</b> <b>mirror</b> that of auxin signaling: the first step {{comprises}} E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes, which tag substrates with ubiquitin to mark them for degradation by proteasomes. The second step utilizes transcription factors to effect physiological changes. One of the key molecules in this pathway is JAZ, which serves as the on-off switch for JA signaling. In the absence of JA, JAZ proteins bind to downstream transcription factors and limit their activity. However, {{in the presence of}} JA or its bioactive derivatives, JAZ proteins are degraded, freeing transcription factors for expression of genes needed in stress responses.|$|R
5000|$|Carrying {{a map and}} compass, {{and knowing}} how to use them, will {{decrease}} the risk of getting lost. Likewise, a Global Positioning System may prove invaluable, as it can pinpoint a traveler's location, revealing his exact position and the direction to roads, services, and inhabited areas. Most GPS devices can also be designed to mark one's path on a map, {{making it easy to}} backtrack. Family Radio Service, General Mobile Radio Service, and amateur radios operating on the [...] "2 meters" [...] band may help maintain communication. Flashing lights, <b>signal</b> <b>mirrors,</b> and whistles are low-tech emergency signals.|$|R
5000|$|The {{heliograph}} remained {{standard equipment}} for military signallers in the Australian and British armies until the 1960s, {{where it was}} considered a [...] "low probability of intercept" [...] type of communication. The Canadian Army was the last major army to have the heliograph as an issue item. By the time the mirror instruments were retired, they were seldom used for signalling. However, {{as recently as the}} 1980s, heliographs were used by Afghan forces during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. [...] <b>Signal</b> <b>mirrors</b> are still included in survival kits for emergency signaling to search and rescue aircraft.|$|R

5000|$|Operation On-Target {{is a high}} {{adventure}} Varsity Scout program activity, open to Venturers {{and older}} Boy Scouts. [...] The event is mainly held in the western United States, but has included Hawaii and New York. The basic idea is to have Scouts scattered across a particular area, located on mountain peaks or other prominent points [...] within line of sight of each other. Using large <b>signaling</b> <b>mirrors,</b> they relay messages from peak to peak. Success in the event depends on team skills such as map-reading, compass skills, mirror-building, <b>mirror</b> <b>signaling</b> and teamwork. Many units spend time in the weeks or months before the actual event learning communications skills like ham radio [...] and signaling. Reaching the peak {{can also be a}} challenge, requiring the boys to practice hiking, camping, and backpacking skills. They also need to consider what they will do if the clouds block the sun.|$|R

5000|$|The Yên Bái air base, {{about 60}} mi {{northwest}} of Hanoi, {{was one of}} the most important and well-defended Vietnamese People's Air Force airbases in North Vietnam. The aircraft bombed and strafed around Yên Bái air base for two hours, reducing enemy opposition so that the helicopters could get in. Fortunately for the Americans, during the second half of May 1972 their increasingly fierce attacks on Yen Bai had forced elements of the VPAF 925th Fighter Regiment to relocate to Gia Lam Airfield. Capt. Ronald E. Smith and his wingman, Capt. [...] "Buck" [...] Buchanan, in A1-Es, went in ahead to locate Locher. Antiaircraft fire aimed at the A1-Es, seen by both the pilots and Locher, served as a reference point to locate Locher, and the A1-E's returned to guide in the rescue helicopters. Smith told Locher to flash the first A-1 he saw with his <b>signal</b> <b>mirror.</b> Upon their return, Buck saw Locher's mirror flash, told Locher to [...] "pop" [...] his [...] "smoke", and guided Capt. Dale Stovall, piloting an HH-53C from the 40th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron, to Locher's position."Locher's flare went unseen, and Stovall overflew his position and had to double back. Spotting the flash from Locher's <b>signal</b> <b>mirror,</b> Stovall hovered over the steep slope, rotors dangerously close to the trees, and lowered a jungle penetrator under enemy fire. Only when Locher rose out of the jungle canopy riding the jungle penetrator were all of the Americans sure it was him. Despite their proximity to Yen Bai air base, no aircraft were lost during Locher's rescue. [...] "We shut down the war to go get Roger Locher," [...] Stovall later said.|$|R

This equipment includes flashlights, <b>signal</b> <b>mirrors,</b> tactical vests, safety vests, and food that will last them at least 24hours. The equipment carried by ground teams varies much by the mission at hand. Urban direction finding (UDF) missions necessitate only a small kit of gear. But intensive mountain search and rescue can require packs that provide for up to 72 hours of operational supplies and tool for the location, rescue and extraction of lost or crashed parties. This gear includes the above, plus additional water, meals, and survival gear. Although a standardized list {{is provided by the}} national command, many teams modify the list to match the needs of the mission.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was at the}} Bureau he {{conceived}} the Lab color scale ("L" [...] for lightness, zero to 100, [...] "a" [...] for red-green, roughly +50 to -50, and [...] "b" [...] for blue-yellow, again roughly -50 to +50) that was much easier for a layperson to comprehend than the XYZ scale scientists had developed to describe the human eye's, three dimensional response to color. The official, NBS circular documenting this development was published in 1942. In 1946, after WW II work on aimable <b>signaling</b> <b>mirrors</b> (the earlier ones had no way for the user {{to see where the}} flash was going) and aerial flares, he left the Bureau to join Gardiner Laboratories where he designed many instruments for the measurement of color and gloss.|$|R
