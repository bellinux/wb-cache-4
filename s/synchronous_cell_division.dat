50|$|In many organisms {{including}} Xenopus and Drosophila, the mid-blastula transition usually occurs after {{a particular}} number of cell divisions {{for a given}} species, and {{is defined by the}} ending of the <b>synchronous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>division</b> cycles of the early blastula development, and the lengthening of the cell cycles by the addition of the G1 and G2 phases. Prior to this transition, cleavage occurs with only the synthesis and mitosis phases of the cell cycle. The addition of the two growth phases into the cell cycle allows for the cells to increase in size, as up to this point the blastomeres undergo reductive divisions in which the overall size of the embryo does not increase, but more cells are created. This transition begins the growth in size of the organism.|$|E

One cDNA fragment that was expressed differently during <b>synchronous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>division</b> had a greatly decreased expression at 30 min {{after the end of}} heat treatment (EHT). Using this fragment as a probe, we isolated the full-length cDNA for T. pyriformis acetyl-CoA synthetase (TpAcs) which encodes a 651 amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 72. 8 kDa. The deduced amino acid sequence of T. pyriformis ACS shows 42 % sequence identity compared with that of Lysobacter sp. acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS), an enzyme which catalyses the formation of acetyl-CoA from acetate via an acetyl-adenylate intermediate. The deduced sequence is also 41 % and 40 % identical compared with those of Pseudomonas putida and Coprinus cinereus ACS, respectively. The deduced sequence of T. pyriformis ACS also shares similar characteristics of the conserved motifs I and II in the ACS family. To further investigate the actions of the gene encoding this enzyme, mRNA expression was determined during the course of synchronized cell division in T. pyriformis. Northern blot results show that the mRNA level was dramatically decreased at 30 min after EHT prior to entering <b>synchronous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>division</b> (which occurs 75 min after EHT), suggesting that mRNA expression of the TpAcs was {{associated with the}} cell cycle and that the down-regulated expression of TpAcs at 30 min after EHT would be required for the initiation of the oncoming <b>synchronous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>division</b> in T. pyriformis...|$|E

Before the second round of <b>cell</b> <b>division</b> at about 1 I h, a significant amount of DNA synthesis is observed. This time it is accompanied by a minor increase in the RNA and protein content of the culture.

40|$|AbstractThe {{product of}} the Drosophila gene tribbles {{inhibits}} <b>cell</b> <b>division</b> in the ventral furrow of the embryo and thereby allows the normal prosecution of gastrulation. <b>Cell</b> <b>division</b> is also absent in involuting dorsal mesoderm during gastrulation in Xenopus, and to ask whether the two species employ similar mechanisms to coordinate morphogenesis and the cell cycle, we isolated a putative Xenopus homologue of tribbles which we call Xtrb 2. Extensive cDNA cloning identified long and short forms of Xtrb 2, termed Xtrb 2 -L and Xtrb 2 -S, respectively. Xtrb 2 is expressed maternally and in mesoderm and ectoderm at blastula and gastrula stages. Later, it is expressed in dorsal neural tube, eyes, and cephalic neural crest. Time-lapse imaging of GFP-tagged Xtrb 2 -L suggests that during <b>cell</b> <b>division,</b> it is associated with mitotic spindles. Knockdown of Xtrb 2 by antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) disrupted <b>synchronous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> during blastula stages, apparently {{as a result of}} delayed progression through mitosis and cytokinesis. At later stages, tissues expressing the highest levels of Xtrb 2 were most markedly affected by morpholino knockdown, with perturbation of neural crest and eye development...|$|R
40|$|Epithelial {{organisation}} {{and integrity}} are {{crucial for the}} compartmentalisation of an organism and its organs and the regulation of information and energy flow. During early tissue morphogenesis, epithelial cells undergo a transition from a very dynamic and highly proliferative mesenchymal-like state to an immotile quiescent epithelial state. During this process cellular polarity changes from rear-front to apical-basal; a process essential for epithelial function. We {{are interested in the}} origin of cell cycle correlations during this process and in the mechanism leading to their desynchronisation. We therefore quantify cell cycle correlations on the tissue level over several generations both in vitro and in silico. Furthermore, we consider their impact on cell migration during tissue morphogenesis. We use Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK- 2) cells as an in vitro model for epithelial tissue morphogenesis and study cell cycle dynamics and cell migration by fluorescence time-lapse microscopy, automated image analysis, and single cell tracking. We determine the narrow distribution of cell cycle periods at low cell density as the cause of the cell cycle correlations. A progressive desynchronisation occurs with each generation of <b>cell</b> <b>divisions.</b> At higher <b>cell</b> density, the desynchronisation process is further accelerated by contact inhibition of proliferation (CIP), resulting in a broadening of the cell cycle period distribution. We suggest that this growth control mechanism ensures the establishment and homeostasis of the emergent epithelial monolayer. Furthermore, we describe a mathematical model for free proliferation at low cell density. Our model confirms the origin of the cell cycle correlations and their progressive desynchronisation and predicts a stationary cell age distribution in case of unlimited growth. Finally, we quantify patterns of cell migration. We observe collective rotations of cell colonies at low cell density and find that changes in this behaviour correlate with mitoses. On the tissue level, <b>synchronous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> therefore involve perturbations of collective migration. Taken together, we conclude that cell cycle correlations in epithelial tissue development are a transient phenomenon and that cells progressively desynchronise by two independent mechanisms, one of stochastic nature, the other one due to contact inhibition of proliferation. In vitro, <b>synchronous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> during early tissue morphogenesis are capable of disturbing tissue morphodynamics, in particular the patterns of collective migration...|$|R
40|$|The UV {{radiation}} {{survival curve}} of exponentially growing cultures of Escherichia coli B/r WP 2 trpE 65 was modified by pretreatment for short incubation periods (up to 20 min) with chloramphenicol such that an extended exponential section of intermediate slope appeared between {{the shoulder and}} the final exponential slope. Surges of mutation to tryptophan independence occurred with each increase in slope of the survival curve. These surges were separated by extended sections of little mutation. Nalidixic acid prevented both the changes in survival and mutation. Mutation curves obtained with overnight cultures had three extended sections of little mutation alternating with sections of high mutation. Reincubation for 60 min in fresh medium reduced or eliminated the low-response sections. These reappeared after 80 to 90 min, when DNA had doubled in the culture and before the initial <b>synchronous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> had occurred.

40|$|Embryogenesis of the {{free-living}} soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans {{produces a}} juvenile having about 550 cells at hatching. We have determined the lineages of 182 cells by tracing the <b>divisions</b> of individual <b>cells</b> in living embryos. An invariant pattern of cleavage {{divisions of the}} egg generates a set of stem cells. These stem cells are the founders of six stem cell lineages. Each lineage has its own clock [...] i. e., an autonomous rhythm of <b>synchronous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>divisions.</b> The rhythms are maintained in spite of extensive cellular rearrangement.

Thus, the destiny of cells seems to depend primarily on their lineage history. The anterior position of the site of origin of the stem cells in the egg relates to the rate of the cell cycle clock, suggesting intracellular preprogramming of the uncleaved egg. We used a technique that allows normal embryogenesis, from the fertilized egg to hatching, outside the parent under a cover glass.

40|$|The Raf- 1 {{gene product}} is {{activated}} {{in response to}} cellular stimulation {{by a variety of}} growth factors and hormones. Raf- 1 activity has been implicated in both cellular differentiation and proliferation. We have examined the regulation of the Raf- 1 /MEK/MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway during embryonic development in the frog Xenopus laevis. We report that Raf- 1, MEK, and MAPK activities are turned off following fertilization and remain undetectable up until blastula stages (stage 8), some 4 h later. Tight regulation of the Raf- 1 /MEK/MAPK pathway following fertilization is crucial for embryonic cell cycle progression. Inappropriate reactivation of MAPK activity by microinjection of oncogenic Raf- 1 RNA results in metaphase cell cycle arrest and, consequently, embryonic lethality. Our findings demonstrate an absolute requirement, in vivo, for inactivation of the MAPK signaling pathway to allow normal cell cycle progression during the period of <b>synchronous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> which occur following fertilization.

40|$|Male meiosis {{in higher}} organisms {{features}} <b>synchronous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> {{in a large}} number of cells. It is not clear how this synchrony is achieved, nor is it known whether the synchrony is linked to the regulation of cell cycle progression. Here, we describe an Arabidopsis mutant, named tardy asynchronous meiosis (tam), that exhibits a phenotype of delayed and asynchronous <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> during male meiosis. In Arabidopsis, two nuclear divisions occur before simultaneous cytokinesis yields a tetrad of haploid cells. In tam, <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> are delayed, resulting in the formation of abnormal intermediates, most frequently dyad meiotic products, or in rare cases, dyad pollen (two gametophytes within one exine wall). Temperature-shift experiments showed that the percentage of the abnormal intermediates increased at 27 °C. Analysis of tam and the tam/quartet 1 double mutant showed that most of these abnormal intermediates could continue through the normal rounds of <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> and form functional pollen, though at a slower than normal pace. The asynchrony of <b>cell</b> <b>division</b> started at the G 2 /M transition, with cells entering metaphase at different time points, during both meiosis I and II. In addition, chromosome condensation defects and mis-segregation were sometimes observed in tam. These observations suggest that the TAM protein positively regulates cell cycle progression, perhaps by promoting the G 2 /M transition.

40|$|With the {{intention}} of investigating the signal-transduction pathway that mediates the cold-stress response in Tetrahymena, we isolated a gene that encodes a novel protein kinase of 561 amino acids, termed Tetrahymena pyriformis NIMA (never-in-mitosis in Aspergillus nidulans) -related protein kinase (TpNrk), by differential display from Tetrahymena cells exposed to temperature shift-down. TpNrk possesses an N-terminal protein kinase domain that is highly homologous with other NIMA-related protein kinases (Neks) involved in {{the control of the}} cell cycle. The TpNrk protein is 42 % identical in its catalytic domain with human Nek 2, 41 % identical with mouse Nek 1 and 37 % with A. nidulans NIMA. In addition, TpNrk and these NIMA-related kinases have long, basic C-terminal extensions and are therefore similar in overall structure. In order to further explore the function of the TpNrk gene and the association of the cold stress with the cell cycle of Tetrahymena, changes of TpNrk mRNA were determined {{during the course of the}} <b>synchronous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>division</b> induced by the intermittent heat treatment. The level of TpNrk transcription increased immediately after the end of the heat treatment, with a peak at 30 min, and declined thereafter reaching the minimum level when nearly 80 % of the cells synchronously entered cell division (75 min after the end of heat treatment). The accumulation of TpNrk mRNA starting from 0 min to 30 min after the end of the heat treatment was assumed to be a prerequisite for the start of <b>synchronous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>division.</b> These results suggest that TpNrk may have a role in the cell cycle of Tetrahymena, and that mRNA expression, at least, is under tight cell-cycle control...|$|E

Although the overall level of cellular autolytic capacity was observed to decline with decreasing growth rate, sharp, periodic fluctuations in cellular autolytic capacity were seen during synchronous growth at all growth rates examined. On the basis of similar patterns of cyclic fluctuations in autolytic {{capacity of}} cultures synchronized by (i) selection, (ii) amino acid starvation followed by size selection, and (iii) amino acid starvation followed by inhibition of DNA synthesis, a link of such fluctuations with the cell division cycle has been postulated...|$|E
40|$|A rapid {{series of}} <b>synchronous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> initiates {{embryogenesis}} in many animal species, including the frog Xenopus laevis. After {{many of these}} cleavage cycles, the nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio increases sufficiently to somehow cause cell cycles to elongate and become asynchronous at the mid-blastula transition (MBT). We have discovered that an unanticipated remodeling of core metabolic pathways occurs during the cleavage cycles and the MBT in X. laevis, as evidenced by widespread changes in metabolite abundance. While many {{of the changes in}} metabolite abundance were consistently observed, it was also evident that different female frogs laid eggs with different levels of at least some metabolites. Metabolite tracing with heavy isotopes demonstrated that alanine is consumed to generate energy for the early embryo. dATP pools were found to decline during the MBT and we have confirmed that maternal pools of dNTPs are functionally exhausted {{at the onset of the}} MBT.

Cytochrome f accumulation is closely followed by an increase in amplitude of the rapid phase in light-induced absorption increase at 520 nanometers and in intensity of the delayed light emission.

The enhanced image detail provided novel localization information for the cell division protein FtsZ, demonstrating a new developmental stage where multiple FtsZ foci accumulate at the septal plane.

The anti-microtubule agent benomyl was shown to inhibit mitosis specifically, while not significantly affecting the accumulation of RNA or protein. DNA synthesis was not directly affected, though accumulation ceased after mitosis was inhibited. The inhibition of mitosis was readily reversible and was followed by a <b>synchronous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>division.</b> Reciprocal shift experiments were carried out using benomyl in conjunction with tempera-ture-sensitive mutants defective in mitosis. Consideration of these experiments and the transition points of the mutants allowed the mutant and the steps controlled by the respective genes to be ordered functionally. Group (i) consisted of cdc 6 - 2 j, which showed an early transition point: the benomyl-sensitive step was dependent on completion of the eded step. Group (ii) consisted of cdc 2 ~ 23 ar>d cdc 2 "j-K. 3, which had transition points close to the time of mitosis itself. The benomyl-sensitive step was dependent on the cdc 2 and cdc 2 ~i steps, but th...|$|E
40|$|The Xenopusmid-blastula {{transition}} (MBT) {{marks the}} onset of large-scale zygotic transcription, {{as well as an}} increase in cell cycle length and a loss of <b>synchronous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>divisions.</b> Little is known about what triggers the activation of transcription or how newly expressed genes interact with each other. Here, we use high-resolution expression profiling to identify three waves of gene activity: a post-fertilisation wave involving polyadenylation of maternal transcripts; a broad wave of zygotic transcription detectable as early as the seventh cleavage and extending beyond the MBT at the twelfth cleavage; and a shorter post-MBT wave of transcription that becomes apparent as development proceeds. Our studies have also allowed us to define a set of maternal mRNAs that are deadenylated shortly after fertilisation, and are likely to be degraded thereafter. Experimental analysis indicates that the polyadenylation of maternal transcripts is necessary for the establishment of proper levels of zygotic transcription at the MBT, and that genes activated in the second wave of expression, including Brachyury and Mixer, contribute to the regulation of genes expressed in the third. Together, our high-resolution time series and experimental studies have yielded {{a deeper understanding of the}} temporal organisation of gene regulatory networks in the early Xenopus embryo...|$|R
40|$|The {{relevance}} of spatial organization of chromatin to regulation of transcription is increasingly recognized [1]. Conversely, it was recently {{suggested that the}} level of general transcription activity affects subnuclear chromatin distribution [2]. Here, we ask how a general increase in transcription by polymerase II changes subnuclear chromatin distribution. Specifically, we used the transition of early zebrafish embryos from transcription quiescence to fully established transcription (Zygotic Genome Activation - ZGA) as a naturally occurring example of transcription level increase. General transcription activity occurs only following ZGA, i. e. 10 <b>synchronous</b> <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> after initial fertilization (three hours post fertilization). To make subnuclear distribution changes during ZGA accessible to super-resolution microscopy, we developed a dissociated cell culture protocol. Zebrafish embryos were dissociated at the 128 -cell stage (three <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> before ZGA). Cultured cells developed transcription activity and morphological hallmarks of ZGA, confirming occurrence of native ZGA. We obtained preliminary results by wide-field fluorescence microscopy. Using fluorescently labeled histone proteins, which spontaneously bind DNA, we visualized a fine-grained chromatin structure in post-ZGA interphase nuclei in vivo. Utilizing antibody fragments (Fabs), we detected agglomerations of transcribing polymerase II in vivo. These agglomerations appeared as micron-sized, approximately spherical “transcription hot spots”. Few large transcription hot spots occurred at the 256 -cell stage; in consecutive cell cycles more and smaller spots appeared. Any distinct signal of transcribing polymerase II disappeared during <b>cell</b> <b>divisions,</b> when no transcription occurs, thus confirming specificity of Fab-based detection of actively transcribing polymerase II. In the future, we will employ super-resolution microscopy to resolve the fine structure of chromatin and transcription hot spots in vivo throughout native zebrafish ZGA.

30|$|The last {{phase of}} the Streptomyces life cycle {{consists}} of the apical cells of the aerial hyphae differentiating into a spore chain [12]. A differentiating apical compartment grows by tip extension and starts <b>synchronous,</b> multiple <b>cell</b> <b>divisions</b> into a developmentally controlled form [40]. Again, there is the participation of FtsZ, which leads to sporulation septa and then these pre-spores assemble thick spore walls by depositing actin [41]. The size of Streptomyces spores can range from 0.7 to 1.2  µm [42, 43]. These last two phases of the Streptomyces life cycle {{are closely related to}} antibiotic production [14]. During programmed cell death of the substrate mycelia, antibiotics are simultaneously produced, perhaps to protect the nutrient sources against competitor microorganisms [44, 45].|$|R
