They {{can be thought of as}} a motor and gearbox with <b>servo</b> <b>input</b> controls. In such servos the input pulse results in a {{rotational}} speed, and the typical 1.5 ms center value is the stop position.

50|$|Most modern ESCs {{incorporate}} a battery eliminator circuit (or BEC) to regulate voltage for the receiver, removing {{the need for}} separate receiver batteries. BECs are usually either linear or switched mode. ESCs, in a broader sense, are PWM controllers for electric motors. The ESC generally accepts a nominal 50 Hz PWM <b>servo</b> <b>input</b> signal whose pulse width varies from 1 ms to 2 ms. When supplied with a 1 ms width pulse at 50 Hz, the ESC responds by turning off the motor attached to its output. A 1.5 ms pulse-width input signal drives the motor at approximately half-speed. When presented with 2.0 ms input signal, the motor runs at full speed.|$|E

The output is driven by a ve bar mechanism, which, in turn, is driven by a <b>servo</b> <b>input</b> and a reference input. By choosing the correct trajectories of the <b>servo</b> <b>input</b> and the starting position, the torque sharing characteristics can be improved, such that the lowest rating servomotor will suface.

50|$|Although 2-axis or 2.5-axis CRC {{problems}} (such as calculating toolpaths for {{a simple}} profile in the XY plane) are quite simple in terms of computational power, {{it is in the}} 3-, 4-, and 5-axis situations of contouring 3D objects with a ball-endmill that CRC becomes rather complex. This is where CAM becomes especially vital and far outshines manual programming. Typically the CAM vector output is postprocessed into G-code by a postprocessor program that is tailored to the particular CNC control model. Some late-model CNC controls accept the vector output directly, and do the translation to <b>servo</b> <b>inputs</b> themselves, internally.|$|R
50|$|Cutter {{location}} is {{the topic of}} where to locate the cutter {{in order to achieve}} the desired contour (geometry) of the workpiece, given that the cutter's size is non-zero. The most common example is cutter radius compensation (CRC) for endmills, where the centerline of the tool will be offset from the target position by a vector whose distance is equal to the cutter's radius and whose direction is governed by the left/right, climb/conventional, up/down distinction. In most implementations of G-code, it is G40 through G42 that control CRC (G40 cancel, G41 left/climb, G42 right/conventional). The radius values for each tool are entered into the offset register(s) by the CNC operator or machinist, who then tweaks them during production {{in order to keep the}} finished sizes within tolerance. Cutter location for 3D contouring in 3-, 4-, or 5-axis milling with a ball-endmill is handled readily by CAM software rather than manual programming. Typically the CAM vector output is postprocessed into G-code by a postprocessor program that is tailored to the particular CNC control model. Some late-model CNC controls accept the vector output directly, and do the translation to <b>servo</b> <b>inputs</b> themselves, internally.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} analyze the {{transmission}} characteristics of the knuckle-triangle working mechanism for servo mechanical presses, an experimental prototype was set up, and a wireless measurement system was developed, to measure the kinematic and dynamic characteristics of the working mechanism. The working principle of the dynamic measurement was expressed. The forming force applied to the slide was measured by a donut-shaped load cell. The driving torque applied to the crank was measured by a resistance strain gage. To collect the testing signals of the forming force and driving torque conveniently and synchronously, a wireless measure system based on WiFi is proposed. Moreover, when the input crank rotates at different angular speeds, the slide stroke curves were measured by a grating scale. The experimental {{results showed that the}} developed system can perform wireless measurement, and provide experimental basis for the analysis of kinematic and dynamic characteristics of the working mechanism with <b>servo</b> <b>input...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Magnetic Servo Levitation (MSL) is an {{important}} ac-tuation principle with potential applications ranging from ultra-high-precision positioning to high-speed rail systems. This paper describes a nonlinear controller design technique for MSL that has inherent robustness to both parametric uncertainties and un-modeled dynamics. Most of the currently available literature on sliding mode considers nonlinear systems that are linear (affine) in the input action. The proposed technique allows designing sliding-mode controllers for the family of nonaffine problems that have an input nonlinearity algebraically invertible {{with respect to the}} available control action. This differs from the standard approach of input feedback linearization, and is based on a modified sliding condition {{that can be used to}} synthesize a switching control law. An equivalent control term can also be included, substantially en-hancing the performance of the controller. Experimental results show that the proposed technique can achieve excellent tracking at high speeds in a fast-tool servo system actuated by MSL.

In this study, we describe the method to measure apparent skin displacement induced by TAC-Cell stimulation of the glabrous surface of the distal phalanx of the index finger. Specifically, we studied the effect of four <b>servo</b> controller <b>input</b> voltages (0. 4 V to 1. 0 V) on resultant skin displacement among eighteen, neurotypical adult male and female participants. A fiberoptic displacement sensor, commonly used in industrial applications, was coupled to the TAC-Cell to measure the glabrous skin’s kinematic response to different stimulus amplitudes. Skin displacement was significantly dependent on stimulus amplitudes and sex (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001). Power spectrum and kinematic analysis of skin displacement showed that the pneumatic TAC-Cell stimulus consists of a spectrally rich, high velocity signal.

40|$|The multi-objective {{trade-off}} paradigm {{has become}} a very valuable design tool in engineering problems that have conflicting objectives. Recently, many control designers have worked on the design methods which satisfy multiple design specifications called multi-objective control design. However,the main challenge posed for the MPC design lies in the high computation load preventing its application to the fast dynamic system control in real-time. To meet this challenge, this thesis has proposed several methods covering nonlinear system modeling, on-line MPC design and multi-objective optimization. First, the thesis has proposed a robust MPC to control the shimmy vibration of the landing gear with probabilistic uncertainty. Then, an on-line MPC method has been proposed for image-based visual servoing control of a 6 DOF Denso robot. Finally, a multi-objective MPC has been introduced to allow the designers consider multiple objectives in MPC design. In this thesis, Tensor Product (TP) model transformation as a powerful tool in the modeling of the complex nonlinear systems is used to find the linear parameter-varying (LPV) models of the nonlinear systems. Higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) technique is used to obtain a minimal order of the model tensor. Furthermore, to design a robust MPC for nonlinear systems {{in the presence of}} uncertainties which degrades the system performance and can lead to instability, we consider the parameters of the nonlinear systems with probabilistic uncertainties in the modeling using TP transformation. In this thesis, a computationally efficient methods for MPC design of image-based visual servoing, i. e. a fast dynamic system has been proposed. The controller is designed considering the robotic visual <b>servoing</b> system's <b>input</b> and output constraints, such as robot physical limitations and visibility constraints. The main contributions of this thesis are: (i) design MPC for nonlinear systems with probabilistic uncertainties that guarantees robust stability and performance of the systems; (ii) develop a real-time MPC method for a fast dynamical system; (iii) to propose a new multi-objective MPC for nonlinear systems using game theory. A diverse range of systems with nonlinearities and uncertainties including landing gear system, 6 DOF Denso robot are studied in this thesis.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{trajectory}} planning for industrial robot manipulators. It describes the existing problem of trajectory planning and proposes an appropriate solution. The proposed solution has been devised, implemented and verified for effective functionality. Trajectory planning {{in this context}} is the process of planning time-based joint position trajectories for a desired end-effector motion. It needs to consider all relevant constraints of the manipulator and given task specifications; because the final end-effector performance totally depends on the way the joint trajectories are planned. However, most trajectory planners in industrial robotics, even today, have adapted the technique of direct sampling of the desired end-effector motion, and transform such Cartesian positions to joint space using inverse kinematics. Then, the planned joint trajectories are simulated to check if they are realizable within the constraints. It is also inspected if the given task specifications are fulfilled sufficiently. Planned end-effector trajectory is iteratively adjusted by trial-and-error, until an optimum trajectory is obtained. This process has many demerits and it is therefore necessary to develop an appropriate trajectory planning algorithm which has provisions to consider constraints and task specifications in planning end-effector trajectories. It should also be generally applicable to industrial manipulators. Through constant collaboration with Yaskawa Robotics Inc., the major considerations of trajectory planning were identified as being : 1. trajectory allowance, 2. sharp corners, 3. joint acceleration limit, 4. assigned end-effector velocity, 5. Jerk reduction, and 6. delay dynamics. They were considered one-by-one, and techniques were developed to incorporate them into a single trajectory planner. Usually, desired end-effector trajectory is not the optimal trajectory. Therefore, the trajectory planner plans a realizable trajectory with the mentioned considerations above. Realizable trajectory is the optimal trajectory within the given trajectory allowance. At sharp corners, a circular arc is introduced within the trajectory allowance. Joint acceleration limit refers to the power amplifier current rating of the servo controller, and assigned end-effector velocity is the speed specification. End-effector trajectory can be planned using maximum joint acceleration as long as the end-effector remains below the assigned velocity. However, as the end-effector reaches assigned velocity, joint accelerations should be reduced and the speed should be uniformly maintained. Jerk can be reduced by fitting a spline approximation to the planned joint trajectories. Delay dynamics can be compensated by way of pole placement techniques and optimizing the pole by considering <b>servo</b> control <b>input.</b> The proposed trajectory planner was devised and implemented to control an industrial robot manipulator (Performer MK 3 s) so that a significant improvement of end-effector performance could be demonstrated. The same trajectory planner was rearranged into an autonomous module and incorporated with real-time control. This new implementation was proposed and implemented for supervisory controlled telerobotics applications. It was also applied for welfare robotics applications. Proposed trajectory planner is an off-line process, and it does not require hardware alterations. Thus, it could be conveniently implemented with existing robot manipulator systems...|$|R
