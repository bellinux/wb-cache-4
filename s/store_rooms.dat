5|$|The {{fossils of}} the Burgess Shale were hidden in <b>store</b> <b>rooms</b> until the 1960s. When Whittington {{and his colleagues}} first began to publish their Burgess finds in the early 1970s, the fossils became central to the debate about how quickly animals arose, and were {{interpreted}} as evidence that all the living bilaterian phyla {{had appeared in the}} Early Cambrian, along with many other phyla that had become extinct {{by the end of the}} Cambrian.|$|E
5|$|Robert Fletcher, costume {{designer}} {{for the previous}} Star Trek films, was responsible for The Search for Spocks wardrobe. Fletcher's job was to sketch outfits, choose the necessary fabrics, and complete the fittings for principal characters. He collaborated with costumer Jim Linn, who clothed extras and managed the logistics of cleaning, repairing, and tracking costumes. Most of the Starfleet uniforms had already been designed for the previous film, but Fletcher wanted to dress the main characters in civilian clothes. Fletcher developed a mythology behind each outfit; the stone ornaments on Sarek's robe, for instance, were intended to be representative of a Vulcan's level of consciousness. The costumer {{had the advantage of}} access to Paramount's <b>store</b> <b>rooms,</b> which contained literal tons of expensive fabrics.|$|E
5|$|It is {{speculated that}} cowrie shells {{may have been}} the {{principal}} currency at Gedi. Cowrie shells have been recovered in the <b>store</b> <b>rooms</b> of the houses and found in greater abundance than struck coins, represented by only two coins of Chinese origin. The use of cowries as currency is supported by their historical use as tender in various parts of Africa, and Kirkman estimated the exchange rate of cowrie shells to the gold dinar to be 400,000 to 1. However, there are examples of locally struck coins at contemporary sites, but none have been recovered at Gedi. The use of beads as a currency has also been proposed by J. F. Schofield, who claims that a {{decline in the number of}} beads recovered in the upper stratigraphic layers reflects a decline in their value around the fifteenth century.|$|E

5|$|The {{ruins of}} the city’s walls are even now discerned in the road between Siri to Qutub Minar and also in {{isolated}} patches behind the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), in Begumpur, Khirki Masjid near Khirki village, Satpula and many other nearby locations; at some sections, as seen at Satpula, the fort walls were large enough to have few in built <b>store</b> <b>rooms</b> to stack provisions and armory. The mystery of the city’s precincts (complex) has unfolded over the years with later day excavations revealing {{a large number of}} monuments in the villages and colonies of South Delhi. Due to compulsions of urban expansion of the Capital City of Delhi, Jahanpanah is now part of the upscale urban development of South Delhi. The village and the wealth of ruins scattered all around are now enclosed by South Delhi suburbs of Panchshil Park South, Malviya Nagar, Adchini, the Aurobindo Ashram, Delhi branch and other smaller housing colony developments. It is hemmed in the NorthSouth direction between the Outer Ring Road and the Qutb Complex and on the eastwest direction by the Mehrauli road and the Chirag Delhi road, with Indian Institute of Technology located {{on the other side of}} the Mehrauli road as an important landmark.|$|E
5|$|In 1939 some paving and {{the walls}} of two unusual {{elliptical}} buildings were discovered, one atop the other. These 'elliptical' buildings were partially uncovered behind Chester's market hall, and no similar buildings {{have been found in}} other legionary fortresses. The buildings were located near the centre of the fortress and they had their own bath buildings and a range of <b>store</b> <b>rooms</b> around the outside. The presence of a second bath building is unusual because legionary fortresses generally had just one set of internal baths. Construction on the site began around AD 77 and this was confirmed by a length of lead piping, which served a central water feature or fountain, which was stamped with the name of Emperor Vespasian. The first building was a prestigious edifice made with concrete foundations and finely dressed stonework, and was probably the finest building in the entire fortress. Technically speaking it was not elliptical, but arcuate, with the central hall being formed from two intersecting arcs, and this makes it unique in the Roman Empire. Its function is unknown. There was no seating within the arcs, which precludes a theatre, and the best guess of the archaeologists was that the twelve alcoves may have contained images of the gods, with the temple being dedicated to the twelve primary gods of the Roman pantheon. Or, alternatively, the oval shape may have represented the shape of the known Roman world, but there is no supporting evidence for this.|$|E
25|$|Subsidiary {{structures}} {{located on}} the island platform south-east of the main station building include: a modern shade structure (not of cultural heritage significance); a signal cabin; and a utilities block containing men's toilets, accessible toilet (former lamp room) and two <b>store</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|E

25|$|In the 19th century {{significant}} {{modifications to the}} property were undertaken. The owners added a service wing to {{the western side of}} the house, running from the original Georgian structure towards the walled garden. This wing contained the kitchens for the house (two in number), two dairies, pantries and <b>store</b> <b>rooms,</b> and servants' accommodation. This wing was damaged by fire in the 1950s, and demolished in the early 1970s. The westernmost portion of the wing remains, and is now in use as garages.|$|E
25|$|The Museum has {{exhibition}} {{rooms and}} <b>store</b> <b>rooms</b> for works of art, distributed across three floors. The upper floor is {{the location of}} the cafeteria/restaurant, esplanade and multi-purpose rooms, the entrance floor has exhibition rooms and a bookshop and the lower floor houses the library and auditorium. Access to these spaces is facilitated via a square-shaped atrium located next to the reception, complemented by a cloakroom and information area, in an area adjacent to the Museum entrance. The Museum building also has a workshops area and another area for activities of the Educational Service, together with complementary areas such as a shop and a large terrace overlooking the Park.|$|E

25|$|The rear carpark {{stands behind}} the rear podium, {{accessed}} from {{the lowest level}} of the building (B3) and from Wedd Street at the rear. It is one-storey with a flat, steel-framed roof clad with metal pan and rib sheeting, pierced by large, rhythmic openings to the sky. A decorative lattice wall of painted concrete breezeblocks lines the Wedd Street boundary, screening the car park. Internally, the former functions of the building are clearly defined, with public entry and reception in the front portico; offices in the tower; vertical circulation, toilets, and other shared facilities in the core; offices and a semi-enclosed carpark in the rear podium; and car parks and <b>store</b> <b>rooms</b> in the rear car park.|$|E
25|$|The tower levels (L1 - L9) each {{comprise}} long, {{open floor}} plans with later lightweight partitions. Window sills are black terrazzo. Small services cores bookend each floor, {{on the east}} and west sides of the tower. These contain fire stairs, service risers, <b>store</b> <b>rooms,</b> and kitchenettes. Some levels retain original black bean veneer fire doors. The top level of the tower (L10) contains two large auditoriums. The larger of the two, named the Charles Barton Auditorium, is double-height and has a raised stage with a proscenium arch, velvet curtains, wings spaces either side, and a backstage area with changing rooms. Under the stage is a storage area accessed via original, battened timber doors. The auditoriums are serviced by a single projection room on a mezzanine between the rooms, accessed via a narrow timber stair.|$|E
25|$|Jackson and {{his wife}} moved into the {{existing}} two-story log blockhouse, built to resist Indian attacks. Jackson added a lean-to {{on the back of}} the cabin and to the rear erected a group of log outbuildings, including slave cabins, <b>store</b> <b>rooms,</b> and a smokehouse. This complex is known historically as the First Hermitage. Jackson started operations of his cotton farm with nine African slaves, but he continued to buy more laborers and owned 44 slaves by 1820. This scale of operation made him rank as a major planter and slaveholder in middle Tennessee, where most farmers owned fewer than 10 slaves, and 20 slaves marked a major planter. Some slave cabins for domestic servants and artisans were located near the main house; the majority, occupied by laborers, were located closer to the fields and were known as the Field Quarter.|$|E

50|$|Structurally, a kalasha on the shikhara {{marks the}} top of the temple, on which seven flags are flown along with the Sudarshana Chakra. The seven flags {{represent}} the 7 'houses' of Pushti Marg or Vallabh Sampradaya. The temple is also popularly called Shrinathji ki Haveli (House of Shrinathji). With the mood of worship in Pushti Marg, Shrinathji is not seen as an impersonal God so the worship is not done like in a temple. Shrinathji is seen as Thakorji or Lord of the House or Haveli and Sewa (service) is offered rather than worship. Like a regular household it has a chariot for movement (In fact the original chariot in which Shrinathji was brought to Singhar), a <b>store</b> <b>room</b> for milk (Doodhghar), a <b>store</b> <b>room</b> for betel (Paanghar), a <b>store</b> <b>room</b> for sugar and sweetmeats (Mishrighar and Pedaghar), a <b>store</b> <b>room</b> for flowers (Phoolghar), a functional kitchen (Rasoighar), a jewellery chamber (Gahnaghar), a treasury (Kharcha bhandaar), a stable for horses of chariot (Ashvashala), a drawing room (Baithak), a gold and silver grinding wheel (Chakki).|$|R
5000|$|The Anubis Shrine {{was found}} behind the unwalled entrance, which leads {{from the grave}} chamber (J) into the {{so-called}} [...] "Store Room" [...] (Ja). The shrine, with a figure of Anubis on top was facing towards the west. Behind it was the Canopic chest with the Pharaoh's canopic jars inside. During {{the work in the}} grave chamber, the entrance to the <b>Store</b> <b>Room</b> was blocked up with wooden boards, so that the clearance work in the grave chamber would not damage the objects in the <b>Store</b> <b>Room.</b> The investigation and clearance of the <b>Store</b> <b>Room</b> began in the fifth excavation season (22 September 1926 - 3 May 1927) and Carter first described the Anubis Shrine in his excavation journal on 23 October 1926.|$|R
500|$|The {{railway tunnel}} ran in a {{straight}} line for a distance of about [...] Along its west side was an unloading platform which gave access to ten cross galleries (numbered 3–13 by the Germans), driven at right angles to the main tunnel at intervals of [...] Each gallery was fitted with a [...] gauge railway track.

500|$|In {{the early}} 1600s, England was {{at peace with}} France and Spain {{and as a result}} the coastal defences {{received}} little attention; a survey found Southsea Castle to be [...] "verie ill prepared for defence", with no guns mounted along the walls or any stocks of powder. In March 1626, a serious fire broke out that destroyed the interior of the keep and generated panic among the ships moored nearby. The damage was not repaired until 1635, when 210 loads of timber was sent from the New Forest for use in the work. Another serious fire then broke out in 1640, causing damage to the lodgings and <b>store</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{entrance}} to the subterranean structures lies on the east, a disposition which would be unparalleled until {{the construction of the}} pyramid of Senusret II, almost 1000 years later. The egyptologists Vito Maraglioglio and Celeste Rinaldi proposed that this unique feature was chosen by the Egyptian architects in order to free {{the north side of the}} pyramid for the construction of a temple. Aidan Dodson showed however that in this situation, the pyramid construction ramp would have [...] "impinged on any northern temple construction even more damagingly". Rather, he explains this unique eastern entrance as resulting from a desire by the architects to allow for easy access to the pyramid <b>store</b> <b>rooms,</b> located immediately beneath the eastern entrance.|$|E
