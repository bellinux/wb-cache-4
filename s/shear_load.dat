40|$|STUDY DESIGN. A biomechanical {{in vitro}} study on porcine and human spinal segments. OBJECTIVE. To {{investigate}} axial rotational {{stability of the}} thoracic spine under dorsal and ventral <b>shear</b> <b>loads.</b> SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. Idiopathic scoliosis is a condition restricted exclusively to humans. An important difference between humans and other vertebrates {{is the fact that}} humans ambulate in a fully erect position. It has been demonstrated that certain parts of the human spine, more specifically the dorsally inclined lower thoracic and high lumbar parts, are subject to dorsally directed <b>shear</b> <b>loads.</b> It has been hypothesized that these dorsal <b>shear</b> <b>loads</b> reduce the rotational stability of the spine, thereby increasing the risk to initiate idiopathic scoliosis. METHODS. Fourteen porcine and 14 human thoracic functional spinal units (FSUs) with intact costotransverse and costovertebral articulations were used for biomechanical testing. In both dorsal and ventral directions, <b>shear</b> <b>loads</b> were applied to the upper vertebra of the FSU in the midsagittal plane (centrally), and at 1 cm to the right and to the left (eccentrically), resulting in a rotary moment. Vertebral rotation was measured at 3 incremental loads by an automated optoelectronic 3 -dimensional (3 D) movement registration system. RESULTS. The results of this study showed that eccentrically applied <b>shear</b> <b>loads</b> induce vertebral rotation in human as well as in porcine spinal segments. At the mid-thoracic and lower thoracic levels, significantly more vertebral rotation occurred under dorsal <b>shear</b> <b>loads</b> than under ventral <b>shear</b> <b>loads.</b> CONCLUSION. These data show that, in humans and in quadrupeds, the thoracic spine is less rotationally stable under dorsal <b>shear</b> <b>loads</b> than under ventral <b>shear</b> <b>loads.</b> © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc...|$|R

5000|$|Bolts {{are often}} {{used to make a}} bolted joint. This is a {{combination}} of the nut applying an axial clamping force and also the shank of the bolt acting as a dowel, pinning the joint against sideways shear forces. For this reason, many bolts have a plain unthreaded shank (called the [...] ) as this makes for a better, stronger dowel. The presence of the unthreaded shank has often been given as characteristic of bolts vs. screws, [...] but this is incidental to its use, rather than defining. The grip length should be chosen carefully, to be around the same length as the thickness of the materials, and any washers, bolted together. Too short places the dowel <b>shear</b> <b>load</b> onto the threads, which may cause fretting wear on the hole. Too long prevents the nut from being tightened down correctly.

5000|$|The most {{prevailing}} bonding {{theory in}} cold spraying {{is attributed to}} [...] "adiabatic shear instability" [...] which occurs at the particle substrate interface at or beyond a certain velocity called critical velocity. When a spherical particle travelling at critical velocity impacts a substrate, a strong pressure field propagates spherically into the particle and substrate {{from the point of}} contact. As a result of this pressure field, a <b>shear</b> <b>load</b> is generated which accelerates the material laterally and causes localized shear straining. The shear loading under critical conditions leads to adiabatic shear instability where thermal softening is locally dominant over work strain and strain rate hardening, which leads to a discontinuous jump in strain and temperature and breakdown of flow stresses. This adiabatic shear instability phenomena results in viscous flow of material at an outward flowing direction with temperatures close to melting temperature of the material. This material jetting is also a known phenomenon in explosive welding of materials.|$|E

The collapse was due mainly to the unfeasibly high bearing load and to the enormous <b>shear</b> <b>load</b> of the dome, which was too flat. These caused the deformation of the piers which sustained the dome. The emperor ordered an immediate restoration.

40|$|Abstract—Prostacyclin (prostaglandin I 2, PGI 2) has {{a variety}} of functions, {{including}} inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation, vasodilation, and antiplatelet aggregation. PGI 2 production in endothelial cells has been reported to increase biphasically after <b>shear</b> <b>loading,</b> but the underlying mechanism is not well understood. To clarify the mechanism for the second phase of PGI 2 upregulation, we examined the gene expression of the enzymes involved in PGI 2 production in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) after shear-stress (24 dyne/cm 2) loading. The production of 6 -keto-PGF 1 a, a stable metabolite of PGI 2, increased time-dependently under shear stress. The arachidonic acid liberation from membrane phospholipids in HUVECs after 12 hours of <b>shear</b> <b>loading</b> was increased significantly compared with the static condition. No change was observed for cytosolic phospholipase A 2 expression, as detected by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. Cyclooxygenase (COX) - 1 mRNA increased after 1 hour of <b>shear</b> <b>loading,</b> and the increase lasted for 12 hours, the longest time tested, whereas COX- 2 mRNA increased after 1 hour of <b>shear</b> <b>loading</b> and peaked at 6 hours.

40|$|Despite {{numerous}} {{years of}} dedicated {{research into the}} origin of idiopathic scoliosis, the pathogenesis of this classic orthopaedic disorder has so far remained elusive. A striking feature of idiopathic scoliosis {{is the fact that}} it does not occur in vertebrates other than humans, despite many similarities in the basic architecture of the vertebral column across the species. From recent work by Castelein et al, it was demonstrated that the fully erect posture, which is unique to humans, significantly alters spinal loading conditions. It was shown that the backward inclined or 'declive' segments of the human spine are subject to dorsal <b>shear</b> <b>loads.</b> These dorsal <b>shear</b> <b>loads</b> are an important distinction between the human spine and the spine of all other vertebrates. In this thesis, it was postulated that excessive dorsal <b>shear</b> <b>loads</b> during the period of rapid growth, could lead to rotational instability of the declive segments of the spine. If progressive, these dorsal <b>shear</b> <b>loads</b> not only reduce rotational stability, but also can enhance a slight preexistent vertebral rotation. 1. In a biomechanical in vitro study on porcine and human spinal segments, we showed that at the mid and lower thoracic levels, significantly more vertebral rotation occurred under dorsal <b>shear</b> <b>loads</b> than under ventral <b>shear</b> <b>loads.</b> These data show that, in humans and in quadrupeds, the thoracic spine is less rotationally stable under dorsal <b>shear</b> <b>loads</b> than under ventral <b>shear</b> <b>loads.</b> We believe that these dorsally directed <b>shear</b> <b>loads</b> can, under critical circumstances during growth, introduce vertebral rotation, whereas ventrally directed loads counteract rotation. 2. The normal, nonscoliotic human spine shows a preexistent pattern of rotation in the transverse plane. The thoracic vertebrae are predominantly rotated to the right side, similar to what is seen in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. We believe that if the spine starts to decompensate into scoliosis, it seems logical that this built-in rotational pattern will be followed. 3. In neuromuscular scoliosis, it was demonstrated that despite the difference in origin, curve patterns in neuromuscular disease show many similarities with those in idiopathic scoliosis, such as a strong prevalence of right convex thoracic curves. We concluded that preexistent rotation, rather than muscle imbalance, also plays an important role in directing subsequent rotation in neuromuscular disease, as it does in idiopathic scoliosis. 4. We also showed the existence of a predominant rotation of the thoracic vertebrae to the right side in the quadruped spine, similar to what was found in humans. It was concluded that preexistent rotation can be considered as a physiological process in the normal development of the spine, independent of the pathogenesis of idiopathic scoliosis. 5. Finally, we demonstrated that the normal, nonscoliotic spine of humans with a complete mirror image reversal of the internal body organs (situs inversus totalis) shows a preexistent pattern of vertebral rotation opposite to what is seen in humans with normal organ anatomy. It was concluded that the asymmetrical anatomy of the thoracic organs is likely to play an important role in the development of this preexistent rotational tendency...|$|R
