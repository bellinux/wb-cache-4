500|$|The {{music video}} {{begins with a}} brief scene of an {{astronaut}} on Mars uncovering a stone slate featuring {{the cover of the}} album Oops!... I Did It Again. A scientist back on Earth sees it through a video transmitter and says, [...] "Cute. What is it?" [...] As the astronaut replies, [...] "Oh, it's cute alright. It couldn't be...", the ground begins to shake as a large stage rises from the ground. Spears then descends from a platform onto a stage in a red catsuit as the track begins to play. As she continues to sing and dance, she suspends the astronaut mid-air above her. Interspersed throughout the video are scenes of Spears wearing a short white top and skirt, lying barefoot on a white web pad with dancers on the ground around her. During its bridge, Spears does a flip in the air to where the astronaut is and appears in a white jacket, short black <b>leather</b> <b>skirt,</b> and <b>leather</b> boots. As a symbol of his love for her, the astronaut gifts Spears with the Heart of the Ocean, the blue diamond from the blockbuster film Titanic (1997). She questions that she [...] "thought the old lady [...] dropped it into the ocean in the end", to which he responds, [...] "Well, baby, I went down and got it for you". Spears comments [...] "Oh, you shouldn't have" [...] and walks away, the astronaut shrugs and leaves. The video concludes as Spears and her performers continue to dance.|$|R
5000|$|The isidwaba {{is said to}} be {{imbued with}} ancestral power, as a result their <b>leather</b> <b>skirts</b> do not belong to them but to the ancestors. Izidwaba (plural) are {{protective}} ancestral garments perceived as concrete symbols of control over women's fertility. A woman is considered figuratively naked, unless she wears her isidwaba. As a result, the women {{have no choice but to}} wear their skirts that are also described as 'ancestral blankets' that enfold and protect the wearer. If the women refrain from wearing the skirts it is believed that they will incur illness or, worse, death. This is a transgression that can only be obviated by slaughtering an animal from their agnatic homesteads to appease their husbands' ancestors.It is not the skill employed in the execution of art objects that is valued, but the spiritual powers they invoke through it. As with the isidwaba, it is by pouring or rubbing the substances onto the artefact that these powers are invoked. The object itself is otherwise meaningless.Another symbolic value is that Amadlozi (ancestral spirits) prefer the dark, this being the reason why the isidwaba is blackened. As a result of this dark marriage skirt, the Amadlozi can accompany the bride to her husband's homestead and ensure her fertility. It is further highlighted in literature that migrant men feel secure when their women wear these skirts when they leave for urban areas. It provides a sense of security that their wives are less likely to have an affair with other men in fear of their ancestors. The author further indicates that married women wear the <b>leather</b> <b>skirts</b> at holy events such as marriage and at a sacred danceThe isidwaba brings respect to the woman wearing it and becomes a symbol to show that she is [...] "taken". To demonstrate the sacredness centred on this Zulu traditional <b>leather</b> <b>skirt,</b> it is said it can never be thrown away, it is buried.|$|R
