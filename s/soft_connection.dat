40|$|A {{computational}} model for catamaran wet deck slamming is developed {{on the basis}} of the variation of added mass as the hulls enter the water. In the case of a wave-piercing catamaran the bow cross section has a double arch cross section and slamming occurs when the arches fill. Residual air is entrained at the top of the arch due to bubble formation by turbulent mixing and this modifies the effect of the water added mass on the hull. The {{computational model}} therefore introduces a <b>soft</b> <b>connection</b> between the water added mass associated with the slam and the hull. The method has been evaluated by comparison with two-dimensional model drop tests in terms of the maximum forces and acceleration imposed on the hull, the variation of velocity during the slam event and the depth of penetration into the water. It is concluded that the added mass computation is adequate for slam modelling in global motions and loads calculations since it gives a good representation of the maximum total forces on the section and their duration...|$|E

40|$|Glass is used {{in current}} {{construction}} applications mostly as a façade element, its structural role being only rarely exploited, despite its significant resistance to in-plane compression. A steel-glass composite beam was built to investigate a hybrid steel-glass assembly and its loadbearing behaviour. To fulfil this objective, the existing types of steel-glass connection were evaluated, which allowed the possibilities offered by adhesive jointing to be highlighted. The selection of the adhesive, detailed in the present article, constituted a crucial aspect. An excessively <b>soft</b> <b>connection</b> does not transfer the shear loads between the glass and steel adherends, whereas an excessively stiff connection leads to failure of the glass. A two-component structural silicone was chosen and its properties were assessed {{with the help of}} an intensive test programme.

Numerical simulations were conducted in parallel to large-scale four-point bending tests on the adhesively bonded steel-glass composite beams.

40|$|The {{propagation}} of a pulse in a nonlinear array of oscillators {{is influenced by}} the nature of the array and by its coupling to a thermal environment. For example, in some arrays a pulse can be speeded up while in others a pulse can be slowed down by raising the temperature. We begin by showing that an energy pulse (1 D) or energy front (2 D) travels more rapidly and remains more localized over greater distances in an isolated array (microcanonical) of hard springs than in a harmonic array or in a soft-springed array. Increasing the pulse amplitude causes it to speed up in a hard chain, leaves the pulse speed unchanged in a harmonic system, and slows down the pulse in a <b>soft</b> chain. <b>Connection</b> of each site to a thermal environment (canonical) affects these results very differently in each type of array. In a hard chain the dissipative forces slow down the pulse while raising the temperature speeds it up.

40|$|The {{significance}} of {{three types of}} design modifications in view of defining passive means to extend the stability bounds of modern wind turbines is assessed in this paper. The first concerns the use of optimized airfoil shapes on a fixed blade planform while the other two concern the increase of structural flexibility by either bringing closer the flap and lead-lag mode frequencies or introducing a <b>soft</b> yaw <b>connection.</b> Such {{an exploration of the}} stability envelope aims at providing the necessary understanding of the mechanisms that control aeroelastic damping and therefore at identifying means for improving the stability behaviour of the lowest damped system modes. Stability calculations are performed in the context of linear eigenvalue analysis using a state-of-the-art stability tool. The model accounts for the full wind turbine configuration and the eigenvalue problem is formulated with reference to the non-rotating (ground-fixed) frame of reference through the multi-blade transformation of all the rotating degrees of freedom. Results are presented in reference to a commercial multi-MW, pitch-regulated, variable-speed wind turbine. They indicate that the soft yaw concept offers more significant margins of improvement compared with the flap-lag coincidence, while aerodynamic optimization could be a basis for improvement.

40|$|Hagfish are marine {{chordates}} that, despite lacking jaws, {{are able}} to feed on large, tough carcasses with the protraction and forceful retraction of toothplates. Using muscle stimulation experiments, we studied {{the function of the}} feeding apparatus muscles in the Pacific hagfish, Eptatretus stoutii, and compared our results with muscle activity patterns recorded from previously studied Atlantic hagfish Myxine glutinosa. Most of our efforts addressed function in the four major feeding apparatus muscles (the deep protractor, sphincter, perpendicular, and retractor muscles), and our stimulations of superficial musculature (superficial protractor muscles and rectus muscles) were assessed qualitatively. Stimulation experiments (tetanic contractions stimulated at 80 V, 60 Hz, 1 ms duration) were performed on in situ and excised feeding apparatuses from five animals positioned supine, while toothplate movements and muscle shape changes (strain) were analyzed from video recordings at 120 Hz. Our results confirm previous observations of M. glutinosa; in E. stoutii, the deep protractor muscles induce toothplate protraction, while activity in the retractor, sphincter, and perpendicular muscles power retraction of the toothplates. In both species, toothplate protraction causes the cylindrical feeding apparatus to decrease in length and increase in diameter, and vice versa during retraction. Upon excision from the body, the feeding apparatus in E. stoutii undergoes greater proportional length changes but smaller changes in width, suggesting that the <b>soft</b> tissue <b>connections</b> to the body wall impose constraints on muscle displacement. Because it comprises {{a large part of the}} head region (anterior 20 % of total length), constraining the cylindrical shape of the feeding apparatus should work in retaining the cylindrical shape of the head while impeding unwanted head deformations in situations where the head must fit and maneuver in tight spaces (e. g. knotting and burrowing behaviors) ...|$|R
5000|$|Desmatosuchus had blunt, bulbous, {{slightly}} recurved teeth. Furthermore, {{they are}} believed to have had homodont dentition. This, combined with its shovel like snout, indicate that Desmatosuchus fed by digging up soft vegetation. This method of feeding is further evidenced by its toothless premaxilla and dentary tip, which were covered in horny sheaths. These sheaths protected the bones and could be used for cutting or holding objects. It is believed that Desmatosuchus dug for food in the soft mud near bodies of water due to the abundance of lakes and rivers in the Dockum area and the fact that Desmatosuchus scutes are often found among parts of other reptiles that are known to have fed along waterways. It is unknown whether or not Desmatosuchus replaced their teeth and, if so, how. The low number of Desmatosuchus teeth that have been discovered indicates that they were only held in place by <b>soft</b> tissue <b>connections.</b> The jaw articulation point is below the tooth line, holding its upper and lower tooth rows parallel while biting {{in a way that is}} reminiscent of ornithischian dinosaurs.

The lateral spike rows showed variation in size among individuals, especially the second most anterior spike. This spike was always shorter than the one in front of it, but to what extent varied drastically. This variation may indicate sexual dimorphism. It has also been hypothesized as a form of sexual display. Aside from this armor, Desmatosuchus was defenseless from attacks from carnivores. Several Desmatosuchus bones have been found amongst skeletons of Postosuchus, indicating predation by Postosuchus. The herd nature of Desmatosuchus apparently did little to discourage predators, as Postosuchus along with several other Late Triassic carnivores also traveled in groups.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — A {{two-phase}} {{power distribution}} scheme for supporting quality-of-service (QoS) and best effort traffic is proposed. We first formulate the power distribution for QoS traffic as an optimization problem {{so that the}} number of simultaneously transmitting connections is maximized. Optimum power distribution is difficult to implement in practice due to both the computational complexity and the requirement for global information about the mobile station (MS) locations, connection channel conditions, and traffic load in the system. We then propose a heuristic scheme of power distribution for <b>soft</b> handoff (SHO) <b>connections.</b> The full scheme includes an initial power distribution (IPD) and a power distribution adjustment (PDA). IPD allocates BS power resource based on the channel condition of each individual connection, while PDA further coordinates the power distribution between neighboring base stations (BSs) in order to accommodate more connections. The proposed power distribution scheme can achieve a capacity close to that of the optimum power distribution, while providing much higher transmission throughput for best effort data traffic. The proposed power distribution scheme can be applied to existing SHO schemes for efficient BS power resource usage. The scheme does not require global information, and its implementation can be further simplified by performing IPD only with slight performance degradation.

40|$|Residual {{dysfunction}} after {{a fracture}} of the distal radius {{is most often}} mild but may give rise to significant impairment especially in the younger active population. The symptoms often manifest around the distal ulna when loading the hand or rotating the forearm. In this region are found articular and <b>soft</b> tissue <b>connections</b> running from the distal ulna to the distal radius {{as well as to}} the ulnar side of the carpus. The aims of this thesis were to investigate the effects of distal radius fractures on the structures about the distal ulna and to what extent malunion and ulnar soft tissue lesions affect function. Both patients and cadaver specimens were used in the five different studies. In a retrospective study of 17 malunited distal radius fractures supination impairment improved significantly by correction of the skeletal malunion. This highlights the importance of distal radioulnar joint congruity for forearm rotation in a subset of cases. The pathomechanisms of injury to the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) were studied. In a cadaveric distal radius fracture model different restraining properties and injury patterns were investigated. Similar patterns of injury were then observed in 20 patients with a displaced distal radius fracture. It was found that a TFCC injury can be expected with dorsal displacement of the distal radius fragment of 32 o or more from the anatomically correct position. The distribution of a TFCC injury apparently differs depending on the size of an associated ulnar styloid fracture. In cases of an intact ulnar styloid or a concomitant tip fracture (Type 1) the first stage of injury seems to be extensor carpi ulnaris subsheath separation from the distal ulna and the dorsal radioulnar ligament. Thereafter follows a disruption of the deep insertions into the fovea of the ulna starting from the palmar and extending dorsally and radially. An extensive injury can be detected with a novel non-invasive test called the ‘bald ulnar head test’, which is performed under anaesthesia. Diagnosis of an acute TFCC injury is difficult using non-invasive methods. In a prospective study of 48 patients, CT scanning to detect pathologic subluxation was found to be of little use in both acute and chronic cases, and is therefore not endorsed on this indication. A radioulnar stress test, which in previous studies has correlated well to a deep TFCC injury, was found to be highly reliable but not to correspond with significant disability in self-administered questionnaires of functional outcome two years or more after injury. This indicates that the subset of patients possibly benefiting from acute repair must be identified by other means...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{architecture}} for highly scalable and reusable time domain beam formers using general-purpose FPGA boards. We also present a comparable architecture {{for the same}} using DSP processors. The FPGA design {{is based on the}} BEE 2 [2] platform. System generality and reusability is the focus of our design, which assumes very little about the target antenna array and avoids any sort of tight coupling between subsystems. Our FPGA prototype, which we call BEEmformer is being deployed at the Allen Telescope Array (ATA) [8] in July 2007. At the core of our system is a single all-purpose design, which becomes a recurring motif replicated on all FPGAs across the system. On a single BEE 2 board we provide a phasing engine for signals having up to 200 MHz bandwidth from 32 antennas while forming 3 simultaneous beams. Multiple boards are connected together to further scale the system arbitrarily in bandwidth, polarization channels, number of simultaneous beams and up to a maximum of 256 antennas, which too is only a <b>soft</b> limit. The <b>connection</b> topology can be modified for any desired configuration on the fly with software control. All communication between subsystems is asynchronous and uses hot-swappable high-speed serial links using industry standard protocols[7]. The globally asynchronous packet processing approach also obviates the need for frequency locked clock distribution. In addition to the above, we have conceptually worked out an architecture for the same instrument using the TMS 320 C 6455, a state of the art DSP processor[1]. DSP processors provide an attractive alternative to FPGAs due to the ease of programming and simulation. We evaluated the performance and data bandwidth of the chip to draw comparisons between the DSP vs. FPGA approaches. ...|$|R

We study an asymptotic regime in which n and N both tend to infinity with limiting ratio n/N = δ ∈ (0, 1), both in the noisy (z 6 = 0) and noiseless (z = 0) cases. Under weak assumptions on x 0, {{we are able to}} precisely evaluate the worst-case asymptotic minimax mean-squared reconstruction error (AMSE) for ` 1 penalized least-squares: min over penalization parameters, max over `p-sparse objects x 0. We exhibit the asymptotically least-favorable object (hardest sparse signal to recover) and the maximin penalization. In the case where n/N tends to zero slowly – i. e. extreme undersampling – our formulas (normalized for comparison) say that the minimax AMSE of ` 1 penalized least-squares is asymptotic to ξ 2 · (2 log(N/n) n) 2 /p− 1 · (1 + o(1)). Thus we have not only the rate but also the constant factor on the AMSE; and the maximin penalty factor needed to attain this performance is also precisely specified. Other similarly precise calculations are showcased. Our explicit formulas unexpectedly involve quantities appearing classically in statis-tical decision theory. Occurring in the present setting, they reflect a deeper connection between penalized ` 1 minimization and scalar <b>soft</b> thresholding.
