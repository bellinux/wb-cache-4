30|$|Polycarboxylic acids form ester cross-links through {{esterification}} reaction with hydroxyl {{groups of}} cellulose, {{in the presence}} of selective weak catalysts such as alkali metal salts of phosphorous containing inorganic acids, e.g. sodium hypophosphite providing high level of resiliency when cured, imparting wrinkle resistance and <b>smooth</b> <b>drying</b> properties without producing any bad odour and stiff handle. Citric acid is the most extensively studied polycarboxylic acid having advantage of being inexpensive, wide availability, non-toxic and environmentally acceptable. It shows only moderate effectiveness as durable press finishing agent due to the presence of an α-hydroxyl group in its molecule which hinders its esterification with cellulose (Andrews 1990; Andrews et al. 1993; Bhattacharyya et al. 1999; Kittinaovarut 2003; Schramm and Rinderer 2000; Welch and Peters 1997; Yatagai and Takahashi 2005, 2006). Yellowing of fabric occurs at high curing temperatures (> 175  °C) causing dehydration of the citric acid through formation of unsaturated polycarboxylic acids, such as aconitic acid, citraconic acid and itaconic acid; but exposing in open atmospheric moisture reverses the heat induced yellowing process to original whiteness (Choi 1993; Murray 1995; Schramm and Rinderer 1999; Welch and Peters 1999, 2000, 2002). During curing in presence of a catalyst, citric acid forms ester linkage (Welch and Peters 1997; Bhattacharyya et al. 1999); cross-links between two cellulose chains firstly by formatting a 5 -membered cyclic anhydride as reactive intermediate and then the reaction between cellulose and anhydride intermediate, which is pH dependent (Yang et al. 2000).|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The ambient gas {{pressure}} is determined for {{the onset of}} splashing of low-viscosity liquid drops on <b>smooth</b> <b>dry</b> surfaces as we change the control parameters: drop impact velocity, drop radius, viscosity, surface tension, density, and gas molecular weight.

By rescaling data using functions of only three dimensionless numbers, the commonly used Reynolds and Weber numbers, as well as the ratio of drop radius to gas mean free path, all data is collapsed to a single curve that encompasses both regimes.

40|$|The corona splash due to {{the impact}} of a liquid drop on a <b>smooth</b> <b>dry</b> {{substrate}} is investigated with high speed photography. A striking phenomenon is observed: splashing can be completely suppressed by decreasing the pressure of the surrounding gas. The threshold pressure where a splash first occurs is measured {{as a function of the}} impact velocity and found to scale with the molecular weight of the gas and the viscosity of the liquid. Both experimental scaling relations support a model in which compressible effects in the gas are responsible for splashing in liquid solid impacts. Comment: 11 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{evolution}} of a splash when a liquid drop impacts a <b>smooth,</b> <b>dry</b> surface. There are two splashing regimes that occur when the liquid viscosity is varied, as is evidenced by its dependence on ambient gas pressure. A high-viscosity drop splashes by emitting a thin sheet of liquid from a spreading liquid lamella long after the drop has first contacted the solid. Likewise, we find that there is also a delay in the ejection of a thin sheet when a low-viscosity drop splashes. We show how the ejection time of the thin sheet depends on liquid viscosity and ambient gas pressure. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
50|$|In {{communities}} where infibulation is common, {{there is a}} preference for women's genitals to be <b>smooth,</b> <b>dry</b> and without odour, and {{both women and men}} may find the natural vulva repulsive. Men seem to enjoy the effort of penetrating an infibulation. The local preference for dry sex causes women to introduce substances into the vagina to reduce lubrication, including leaves, tree bark, toothpaste and Vicks menthol rub. The WHO includes this practice within Type IV FGM, because the added friction during intercourse can cause lacerations and increase the risk of infection. Because of the smooth appearance of an infibulated vulva, there is also a belief that infibulation increases hygiene.|$|R

40|$|We {{simulate}} {{the impact of}} a viscous liquid drop onto a <b>smooth</b> <b>dry</b> solid surface. As in experiments, when ambient air effects are negligible, impact flattens the falling drop without producing a splash. The no-slip boundary condition at the wall produces a boundary layer inside the liquid. Later, the flattening surface of the drop traces out the boundary layer. As a result, the eventual shape of the drop is a "pancake" of uniform thickness except at the rim, where surface tension effects are significant. The thickness of the pancake is simply the height where the drop surface first collides with the boundary layer. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figures, submitted to Physical Review Letter...|$|R

40|$|After impact onto a <b>smooth</b> <b>dry</b> surface, {{a drop of}} {{viscous liquid}} {{initially}} spreads {{in the form of}} a thick lamella. If the drop splashes, it first emits a thin fluid sheet that can ultimately break up into droplets causing the splash. Ambient gas is crucial for creating this thin sheet. The time for sheet ejection, $t_{ejt}$, depends on impact velocity, liquid viscosity, gas pressure and molecular weight. A central air bubble is trapped below the drop at pressures even below that necessary for this sheet formation. In addition, air bubbles are entrained underneath the spreading lamella when the ejected sheet is present. Air entrainment ceases at a lamella velocity that is independent of drop impact velocity as well as ambient gas pressure. Comment: 8 pages, 11 figure...|$|R
