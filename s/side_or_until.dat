50|$|Traditional {{preparation}} of fried green tomatoes begins by cutting the tomatoes into approximately 1/4-inch (~0.6 cm) slices. They are then seasoned {{with salt and}} pepper, coated with plain, coarse cornmeal, and shallow fried in bacon fat {{for a few minutes}} each <b>side,</b> <b>or</b> <b>until</b> golden brown. Shallow frying is preferred, as the tomatoes do not float in the oil, which allows the weight of the tomato to press the cornmeal to the underside of the tomato. This negates the need for a 'wash' (see below).|$|E
50|$|While {{juvenile}} iridescent {{sharks are}} sold as pets for home aquariums, {{they are not}} easy fish to keep. While they can survive in a 40-gallon aquarium, iridescent sharks are schooling fish that prefer groups, are accustomed to living in rivers, and are active fish that require space. They have very poor eyesight, so detected movement from outside of their habitat {{can be seen as}} a threat. If stressed, their first instinct is to flee; a blind dash can cause injury in an aquarium environment. These imjuries may result in the fish sinking to the bottom, where it may lie on its <b>side</b> <b>or</b> back <b>until</b> it recovers.|$|R
5000|$|The host {{would then}} ask one {{question}} {{at a time}} to each player, alternating back and forth. They would then answer the question, after which the host would either say [...] "that is the correct answer" [...] or inform them that they were incorrect and give them the right answer. Play continued in this manner until either all five (or three) questions per <b>side</b> were asked <b>or</b> <b>until</b> it became impossible for one of the two finalists to win.|$|R
5000|$|The bushland {{began to}} be cleared in the late 19th century to be {{replaced}} by orchards and other small farms. The area escaped major subdivision during Campbelltown's population boom of the 1970s when the Council zoned the suburb a [...] "Scenic Protection Area" [...] with minimum land sizes of 5 acre. Until then, the area was known as East Minto and, like its neighbour, was named after the Earl of Minto, Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, who was Viceroy of India from 1807-1814. In 1973, Campbelltown Council proposed changing the name to Warby, which was rejected by locals who insisted it be called East Minto. This, in turn, was rejected by the Geographical Names Board of New South Wales, which had a policy against [...] "East" [...] and other compass points being added to suburb names. Eastminto, Myrtlefield, Hansen and Kyngmount were also rejected by one <b>side</b> <b>or</b> the other <b>until</b> consensus was reached with Minto Heights in 1976.|$|R
5000|$|Combat is {{somewhat}} abstracted, with the ships being lined up off map. [...] All combat begins at long range. On subsequent combat rounds a die is rolled {{to see who}} determines combat range (long or short) with the smaller fleet gaining a bonus to their die roll. The defender places the ships down one at a time, and the attacker places a ship down to match. At the end, any left-over ships can be assigned to also fire on enemy vessels, or kept out of combat. The missile or beam factors of the firing ships are compared to the screen factors of the defenders, and a die roll determines if a ship has been destroyed. Several combat options are available, including firing all of a ship's missiles at once, or the so-called [...] "suicide attack" [...] where a ship maneuvers to point-blank range for a beam attack. Combat continues until one <b>side</b> is destroyed <b>or</b> <b>until</b> either player decides to disengage.|$|R

50|$|A game {{lasts for}} fifteen minutes <b>or</b> <b>until</b> all {{opposing}} tanks are shot down. The game uses Namco's Super System 22 board, with a custom cabinet. Players must sit down in order to play the game. Games can be played either as a competition with human players on both <b>sides</b> <b>or</b> cooperatively {{on the same team}} against AI-controlled opponents. Unlike most arcade games, high scores are not recorded and initials are not used to discriminate between the first player and the second player. The player has to look in his or her monitor to find out whether he or she has vanquished the opposition (which consists of twenty tanks). Although only two players can play at a time, up to four machines can be interconnected to provide up to eight players a chance to compete in tournament-style matches.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} a {{common type of}} salt wall found in extensional regimes which possess the characteristics: cover strata truncated against both flanks; an asymmetric appearance in cross-section caused by normal fault-related growth patterns; {{and at least one}} unconformity and onlap surface separating strata which are tilted in opposite directions. This type of structure evolves by a process known as flip-flop salt tectonics starting with a roller where a normal fault detaches down one flank of the embryonic salt body. The structure grows as salt flows towards the low-stress zone below the crest of the footwall causing it to swell and tilt backwards until it becomes gravitationally unstable, until the cover strata on one <b>or</b> both <b>sides</b> welds out <b>or</b> <b>until</b> the salt emerges at surface. Further growth is then accommodated by switching to a new counter-dipping fault that detaches on the opposite flank of the salt body leading to a flip in hanging-wall/footwall polarity marked by an unconformity and onlap surface. The salt body con-tinues to grow beneath the new footwall, causing partial inversion of the old hanging wall. Additional switchesmay occur, leading to tall flip-flop structures until the source of salt is depleted. Salt structures have been described in detail {{from a wide variety of}} tectonic settings; however, many classic regions of salt walls and diapirs are located on passive margins. Passive margins, such as the South Atlantic margins of Brazil and west Africa and the Gulf of Mexico, are characterized by gravity-driven processes (e. g. Cobbold & Szatmar...|$|R
