5|$|In March 2005 Sihanouk accused Thailand, Laos, and Vietnam of {{encroaching}} into Cambodian territory, through unilateral border demarcation exercises without Cambodian participation. Two months later, Sihanouk {{formed the}} Supreme National Council on Border Affairs (SNCBA), which he headed, {{to address these}} concerns. While the SRP and Chea Sim expressed support for Sihanouk {{for the formation of}} the SNCBA, Hun Sen decided to form a <b>separate</b> <b>body,</b> National Authority on Border Affairs (NABA), to deal with border concerns, with SNCBA to serve only as an advisory body. After Hun Sen signed a border treaty with Vietnam in October 2005, Sihanouk dissolved the SNCBA. In August 2007 the Cambodian Action Committee for Justice and Equity, a US-based human rights NGO, called for Sihanouk's State immunity to be lifted, so as to allow him to testify in the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC). Sihanouk responded to the call by inviting the ECCC public affairs officer, Peter Foster, for a discussion session on his personal experience under the Khmer Rouge regime. Both Hun Sen and FUNCINPEC criticized the suggestion, with the latter accusing the NGO of being disrespectful. The ECCC subsequently rejected Sihanouk's invitation.|$|E

Although Nixon suspended Davis-Bacon, Usery and others soon convinced Nixon to reinstate Davis-Bacon enforcement and establish a <b>separate</b> <b>body</b> to review contract union contracts.

25|$|Some {{orthodox}} Quakers in America {{disliked the}} move towards evangelical Christianity {{and saw it}} as a dilution of Friends' traditional orthodox Christian belief in being inwardly led by the Holy Spirit. These Friends were led by John Wilbur who was expelled from his yearly meeting in 1842. He and his supporters formed their own Conservative Friends Yearly Meeting. In the UK in 1868 some Friends broke away from London Yearly Meeting for the same reason. They formed a <b>separate</b> <b>body</b> of Friends called Fritchley General Meeting, which remained distinct and separate from London Yearly Meeting until 1968. Similar Christian splits took place in Canada. The Yearly Meetings that supported John Wilbur's religious beliefs were known as Conservative Friends.|$|E

500|$|Under the Local Government Act 1972, the town's Urban District {{status was}} abolished, {{and the area}} has, since 1 April 1974, formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, a local {{government}} district of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. [...] A civil parish of Crompton was formed in April 1987 and renamed to [...] "Shaw and Crompton" [...] in July 1987. [...] The civil parish has its own parish council, giving it some limited local government autonomy {{from that of the}} wider Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, and including the status as a statutory consultee on local planning applications. The council comprises 14 locally elected members, councillor Ann Tindall is the parish chairman 2017-2018 and is consulted in planning applications that affect the area through the Shaw and Royton Area Committee of Oldham Metropolitan Borough Council. Shaw and Crompton Community Council, a <b>separate</b> <b>body,</b> meets at least four times per year and is designed to allow local people to put forward their priorities for the area in which they live, suggest improvements and have their say on how services are run on a local basis. Shaw and Crompton does not have a mayor, but does have a town crier, a purely ceremonial role. Shaw and Crompton is one of only a few parishes of England that still observes the ancient custom of Beating the bounds. Originally an annual event, it now takes place every seven years.|$|E

Mr. Weldon (the inventor), made one {{successful}} descent on 7 June and said [...] "I will undertake to pass 1,500tons of goods through the lock in 12hrs". Tenders were invited on 28 June for further constructions. Two more attempts to use the caisson lock took place on 11 April and 2 May (only the latter was successful). By 22 August 1799 the second rebuilding of the caisson had been abandoned. It was replaced by three locks and an inclined plane trackway, but the trackway was not successful either, and the company proposed to raise more money to finance {{the building of a}} flight of 19locks to replace it, the use of which would incur an additional toll of one shilling per ton on all traffic. This was vigorously opposed by the owners of the Kennet and Avon Canal and the Wilts and Berks Canal, {{on the grounds that the}} price of coal to their customers would be too high. After negotiation, the company obtained a new Act of Parliament on 30 April 1802, which authorised the formation of a <b>separate</b> <b>body</b> called [...] "The Lock Fund of the Somerset Coal Canal Company", with powers to raise the sum of Â£45,000. The money was raised by the Kennet and Avon, the Wilts and Berks and the Somerset Coal Canal each contributing Â£15,000, and the one shilling surcharge was to be levied until the capital had been repaid, after which it would cease.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{procedure}} for the dynamic analysis of body separation is introduced. Based on the general laws of classical dynamics, the method for obtaining the velocity and the angular velocity of the remainder body during separation is developed. Due to the discontinual mass variation the jump-like change of the velocity and the angular velocity {{of the body is}} evident. Various types of motion of the <b>separated</b> <b>body</b> are considered. Depending on the type of motion of the <b>separated</b> <b>body</b> the dynamic properties of the remainder body are obtained. As a special case the in-plane motion of the body before and after separation is considered. The theoretical considerations are applied for the separation analysis of a rotor (a shaft-disc system). The transient motion of the body after separation is investigated. To prove the correctness of the procedure suggested in the paper the case when the mass and the moment of inertia of the <b>separated</b> <b>body</b> are infinitesimal is analyzed. The obtained differential equations are the same as those previously obtained. Key words: body separation, discontinual mass variatio...|$|R
500|$|As {{the land}} dried, the peaty soils shrank, causing the land surface to drop. Much of the Middle Levels was flooded in 1841-2, and this led the Commissioners {{to obtain an}} Act of Parliament in 1844, which {{authorised}} {{the construction of a}} new main drain, [...] long, in order that water could flow by gravity to Wiggenhall St Germans, where the levels of the tidal river were about [...] lower than at Salters Lode. The work was completed in 1848, and the sluice at Marmount Priory was also built at this time, in order to allow boats with a deeper draught to navigate through Upwell and Outwell. A railway line from [...] to [...] passed through the port of March from 1846, which soon became a railway hub, with branch lines to Wisbech and St Ives. Traffic transferred from the waterways, which made the drainage responsibilities of the Commissioners easier. The new main drain enabled Whittlesey Mere to be drained. A pumping station with an Appold centrifugal pump was used to achieve this, rather than the more traditional scoop wheel. The pump had been shown for the first time at the Great Exhibition in 1851, where it amazed visitors, and its inventor was commissioned to design a pump for the draining of the mere. It was [...] in diameter, and powered by a [...] steam engine, could raise 101 tons of water per minute by [...] In 1862 an Act of Parliament created the Middle Level Commissioners as a <b>separate</b> <b>body</b> to the Bedford Level Corporation, although they had been almost independent since 1810, and they embarked on a series of improvements. Drainage was always the primary function, but navigation was also important, and the new body had powers to charge tolls for the use of the waterways.|$|E
