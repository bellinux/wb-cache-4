40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a new method for {{measuring}} the closeness <b>of</b> multiple <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> that are combined using Dempster’s <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> combination to improve classification performance. The closeness provides an insight into combining multiple <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> in classification − in what circumambience the performance of combinations <b>of</b> some <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> using Dempster’s rule is better than that of others. Experiments {{have been carried out}} over the 20 -newsgroups benchmark data collection, and the empirical results show that when the closeness between two <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> is higher than that of others, the performance of its combination using Dempster’s rule is better than the others. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} a {{successful}} experiment of computeraided theorem discovery {{in the area of}} logic programming with answer set semantics. Specifically, with the help of computers, we discovered exact conditions that capture the strong equivalence between a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> a <b>rule</b> and the empty <b>set,</b> a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> a <b>rule</b> and another <b>set</b> <b>of</b> a <b>rule,</b> a <b>set</b> S <b>of</b> two <b>rules</b> and a subset of S with one <b>rule,</b> a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> two <b>rules</b> and a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> another <b>rule,</b> and a <b>set</b> S <b>of</b> three <b>rules</b> and a subset of S with two rules. We prove some general theorems that can help us verify the correctness of these conditions, and discuss the usefulness of our results in program simplification. ...|$|R

5|$|Grammar can be {{described}} as a system of categories and a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> that determine how categories combine to form different aspects of meaning. Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through the use of categories or lexical units. However, several categories are so common as to be nearly universal. Such universal categories include the encoding of the grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically distinguishing between their relations to a predicate, the encoding of temporal and spatial relations on predicates, and a system of grammatical person governing reference to and distinction between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, Noam Chomsky {{formulated}} the generative {{theory of}} language. According to this theory, {{the most basic}} form of language {{is a set of}} syntactic rules that is universal for all humans and which underlies the grammars of all human languages. This <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> is called Universal Grammar; for Chomsky, describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. Thus, he considered that the grammars of individual languages are only of importance to linguistics insofar as they allow us to deduce the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.|$|E
5|$|Paterson's worms are {{an attempt}} to {{simulate}} the behaviour of prehistoric worms. These creatures fed upon sediment {{at the bottom of}} ponds and avoided retracing paths they had already travelled because food would be scarce there but, because food occurred in patches, it was in the worm's interest to stay near previous trails. Different species of worm had different innate rules regarding how close to travelled paths to stay, when to turn, and how sharp a turn to make. In 1969 Raup and Seilacher created computer simulations of the fossilized worm trails, and these simulations inspired Paterson and Conway to develop a simple <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> to study idealized worms on regular grids.|$|E
5|$|Rutgers {{was first}} to extend {{the reach of the}} game. An intercollegiate game was first played in the state of New York when Rutgers played Columbia on November 2, 1872. It was also the first {{scoreless}} tie {{in the history of the}} fledgling sport. Yale football started the same year and had its first match against Columbia, the nearest college to play football. It took place at Hamilton Park in New Haven and was the first game in New England. The game used a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> based on association football with 20-man sides, played on a field 400 by 250 feet. Yale wins 3-0, Tommy Sherman scoring the first goal and Lew Irwin the other two.|$|E

5|$|The Cambridge Rules, first {{drawn up}} at Cambridge University in 1848, were {{particularly}} {{influential in the}} development of subsequent codes, including association football. The Cambridge Rules were written at Trinity College, Cambridge, at a meeting attended by representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester and Shrewsbury schools. They were not universally adopted. During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the Sheffield Football Club, formed by former public school pupils in 1857, which led to formation of a Sheffield FA in 1867. In 1862, John Charles Thring of Uppingham School also devised an influential <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>rules.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> prescribed {{that all}} games {{were to be}} played for ante. Garfield was partly inspired by the game of marbles and wanted folks {{to play with the}} cards rather than collect them. For Magic, each player removed a card at random from the deck they wished to play with and the two cards would be set aside as the ante. At the end of the match, the winner would take and keep both cards. Early sets included a few cards with rules designed to interact with this gambling aspect, allowing replacements of cards up for ante, adding more cards to the ante, or even permanently trading cards in play.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{some other}} {{classical}} figures (Comte, Durkheim) Weber did not attempt, consciously, to create any specific <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> governing social sciences in general, or sociology in particular. In comparison with Durkheim and Marx, Weber was {{more focused on}} individuals and culture and this is clear in his methodology. Whereas Durkheim focused on the society, Weber concentrated on the individuals and their actions (see structure and action discussion) and whereas Marx argued for {{the primacy of the}} material world over the world of ideas, Weber valued ideas as motivating actions of individuals, at least in the big picture.|$|E

5|$|Around 1845, Rosas {{managed to}} {{establish}} absolute dominance over the region. He exercised complete control over {{all aspects of}} society with the solid backing of the army. Rosas was raised from colonel to brigadier general (the highest army rank) on 18 December 1829. On 12 November 1840 he declined the newly created and higher rank of grand marshal (gran mariscal), which had been bestowed on him by the House of Representatives. The army was led by officers who had backgrounds and values similar to his. Confident of his power, Rosas made some concessions by returning confiscated properties to their owners, disbanding the Mazorca and ending torture and political assassinations. The inhabitants of Buenos Aires still dressed and behaved according to the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> Rosas had imposed, but the climate of constant and widespread fear greatly diminished.|$|E
5|$|Before 2000, MMA had {{a number}} of {{different}} rule sets, with each one differing in ruling on downward elbow strikes (12-6 elbows). In UFC 1, the first UFC event where there were very few rules, Kevin Rosier used 12-6 elbows on Zane Frazier. In 2000, the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts were drawn up {{to try to make the}} sport more mainstream. The meeting consisted of representatives of a number of major MMA organisations including Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), Pride Fighting Championships and International Fighting Championships (IFC) as well as doctors and referees in New Jersey, United States. In the meeting, doctors raised concerns about 12-6 elbows after seeing an IFC match where 12-6 elbows were used to the back of a fighter's head. One doctor argued that they could be life-threatening, and refused to sanction any <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> that didn't prohibit them.|$|E
5|$|By 1873, {{the college}} {{students}} playing football had made significant efforts to standardize their fledgling game. Teams had been scaled down from 25 players to 20. The {{only way to}} score was still to bat or kick the ball through the opposing team's goal, and the game was played in two 45 minute halves on fields 140 yards long and 70 yards wide. On October 20, 1873, representatives from Yale, Columbia, Princeton, and Rutgers met at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York City to codify {{the first set of}} intercollegiate football rules. Before this meeting, each school had its own <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>rules</b> and games were usually played using the home team's own particular code. At this meeting, a list of rules, based more on the Football Association's rules than the rules of the recently founded Rugby Football Union, was drawn up for intercollegiate football games.|$|E
