500|$|Not {{long after}} 1600 Wright was {{appointed}} as surveyor to the New River project, which successfully directed {{the course of}} a new man-made channel to bring clean water from Ware, Hertfordshire, to Islington, London. Around this time, Wright also lectured mathematics to merchant seamen, and from 1608 or 1609 was mathematics tutor to the son of James I, the heir apparent Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, until the latter's very early death at the age of 18 in 1612. A <b>skilled</b> <b>designer</b> of mathematical instruments, Wright made models of an astrolabe and a pantograph, and a type of armillary sphere for Prince Henry. In the 1610 edition of Certaine Errors he described inventions such as the [...] "sea-ring" [...] that enabled mariners to determine the magnetic variation of the compass, the sun's altitude and the time of day in any place if the latitude was known; and a device for finding latitude when one was not on the meridian using the height of the pole star.|$|E
500|$|Wright was a <b>skilled</b> <b>designer</b> of {{mathematical}} instruments. According to the 1615 Caius annals, [...] "e was excellent both in contrivance and execution, {{nor was he}} inferior to the most ingenious mechanic {{in the making of}} instruments, either of brass or any other matter". For Prince Henry, he made models of an astrolabe and a pantograph, and created or arranged to be created out of wood a form of armillary sphere which replicated the motions of the celestial sphere, the circular motions of the sun and moon, and the places and possibilities of them eclipsing each other. The sphere was designed for a motion of 17,100years, if the machine should last that long. In 1613 Wright published The Description and Use of the Sphære, which described the use of this device. The sphere was lost during the English Civil War, but found in 1646 in the Tower of London by the mathematician and surveyor Sir Jonas Moore, who was later appointed Surveyor General of the Ordnance Office and became a patron and the principal driving force behind the establishment of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich. Moore asked the King to let him have it, restored the instrument at his own expense and deposited it at his own house [...] "in the Tower".|$|E
2500|$|The French {{landscape}} and building architect, Joseph Jacques Ramée had already established {{a reputation as}} a <b>skilled</b> <b>designer</b> of landscapes combined with houses and other kinds of buildings {{by the time he was}} persuaded to visit America in search of projects. One of his projects had been the design of the estate of David Parish’s father in Hamburg, and Parish remembered this when he sought an architect to help him develop settlements on vast tracts of land in northern New York he had purchased on speculation. [...] Ramée arrived in the northern Adirondacks in late 1812 to work on projects in and around the small towns on Parish’s land. But not even the ambitious Parish could keep the famous architect busy enough to support his family, so Parish also acted as agent in finding Ramée other work. [...] So, it was natural that on a return trip to Philadelphia in January 1813, Parish should introduce Ramée to Eliphalet Nott, who was already in the college building business. Nott hired Ramée almost immediately to draw up plans for the new campus, for the fairly grand sum of $1,500 (roughly $ today). [...] Ramée worked on the drawings for about a year, and construction of two of the college buildings proceeded quickly enough to permit occupation in 1814. The Union College campus thus became the first comprehensively planned college campus in the United States.|$|E

50|$|Charles Fairey {{was born}} on 5 May 1887 in Hendon, Middlesex and educated at the Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood and Ardingly College, and later as an {{apprentice}} at the Finsbury Technical College where he studied City & Guilds courses in electrical engineering and chemistry. Fairey’s father had {{died when he was}} aged 11 and although from a middle-class background this dramatic change in the families circumstances led to Fairey taking a job, aged 15 with the Jandus Electric Company of London, who manufactured arc lamps. His progress was such {{that he was able to}} take charge of the installation of electric lights at Heysham docks whilst still in his teens. His next job was as an analytical chemist, working on boiler-feed and fuel problems at Municipal Borough of Finchley power station. Fairey became a <b>skilled</b> <b>designer</b> and builder of model aeroplanes and active member of the Kite and Model Aeroplane Association. On 4 June 1910 (aged 23) Fairey entered a model flying competition at Crystal Palace, London. His model monoplane design won 1st prize in the Longest Flight and Stability Competition with a distance of 153yds 1 ft 10in. His success in aeroplane modeling helped establish his reputation as a craftsman and innovator.|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the nature}} of design ability can better enable design {{educators}} to nurture its development in their students. Such understanding has been promoted by {{a wide variety of}} studies of design activity and designer behaviour. From a review of these studies, design ability is summarised as comprising resolving ill-defined problems, adopting solution-focussed cognitive strategies, employing abductive or appositional thinking and using non-verbal modelling media. These abilities are highly developed in <b>skilled</b> <b>designers,</b> but are also possessed in some degree by everyone. A case is therefore made for design ability as a fundamental form of human intelligence. The nurture of this ability through design education is discussed, with particular reference to the problem of providing design education through the distance-learning media of the Open University...|$|R

First, we extend the d-touch topological approach to creating visual markers that has previously been shown to support creative design with two new techniques: area order codes and visual checksums. We then show how the topological structure of such markers provides the basis for recombining designs to generate many variations. We demonstrate our approach {{through the creation of}} beautiful, personalized and interactive wallpaper. We reflect on how technologies must enable designers to balance goals of scalability, aesthetics and reliability in creating beautiful interactive decoration...|$|R

It isn't entirely clear to me what purpose it is supposed to serve, but it seems like unnecessary clutter. I also strongly dislike the superfluous file preview feature which wastes a lot of screen space in order to display a playable video thumbnail. The preview feature is fortunately easy to disable.The whole programs feels uncharacteristically clunky by GNOME standards, but it's a lot more functional than the stale and unambitious CD burning component that was included in previous versions of GNOME. I think that Brasero is the right way forward in the long term, but the user interface really doesn't please me.My biggest complaint with the old Nautilus CD burner is that it didn't give you clear visual hints about how much space you have left when you are putting in files to burn. The fact that Brasero dropped that feature is a bit of a disappointment. It seems like the task of building a good disc burning UI with GTK+ is not trivial and it's something that I suspect will take a <b>skilled</b> <b>designer</b> rather than a developer.Despite the problems with Brasero's interface, it's really a very capable program with a rich feature set, which leaves me hopeful that it will be able to really shine someday..|$|E

Most circuit design systems are given the circuit schematic and use arithmetic constraints to select component values. This circuit designer is different because it designs the schematic. The designer uses a unidirectional CONTROL relation to find the schematic. The circuit designs are built around this relation; it restricts the search space, assigns purposes to components and finds design bugs...|$|R
