25|$|Most {{reptiles}} lack {{a secondary}} palate, {{meaning that they}} must hold their breath while swallowing. Crocodilians have evolved a bony secondary palate {{that allows them to}} continue breathing while remaining submerged (and protect their brains against damage by struggling prey). Skinks (family <b>Scincidae)</b> also have evolved a bony secondary palate, to varying degrees. Snakes took a different approach and extended their trachea instead. Their tracheal extension sticks out like a fleshy straw, and allows these animals to swallow large prey without suffering from asphyxiation.|$|E

2500|$|The herpetologist Laurence Monroe Klauber proposed, in a tongue-in-cheek article which blames Dr. Watson {{for getting}} {{the name of the}} snake wrong, a theory that the swamp adder was an {{artificial}} hybrid between the Mexican Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum) and Naja naja. His speculation suggests that Doyle might have hidden a double-meaning in Holmes' words. What Holmes said, reported by Watson, was [...] "It is a swamp adder, the deadliest snake in India"; but Klauber suggested what Holmes really said was [...] "It is a samp-aderm, the deadliest skink in India." [...] Samp-aderm can be translated [...] "snake-Gila-monster": Samp is Hindi for snake, and the suffix aderm is derived from heloderm, the common or vernacular name of the Gila monster generally used by European naturalists. Skinks are lizards of the family <b>Scincidae,</b> many of which are snake-like in form. Such a hybrid reptile will have a venom incomparably strengthened by hybridization, assuring the almost instant demise of the victim. And it will also have ears like any lizard, so it could hear the whistle, and legs and claws allowing it to run up and down the bell cord with a swift ease.|$|E
60|$|Reptiles and Amphibia of the Seychelles.--The {{reptiles}} and amphibia {{are rather}} numerous and very interesting, indicating {{clearly that the}} islands can hardly be classed as oceanic. There are seven species of lizards, three being peculiar to the islands, while the others have rather a wide range. The first is a chameleon--defenceless {431} slow-moving lizards, especially abundant in Madagascar, from which no less than eighteen species are now known, {{about the same number}} as on the continent of Africa. The Seychelles species (Chamæleon tigris) also occurs at Zanzibar. The next are skinks (<b>Scincidæ),</b> small ground-lizards with a wide distribution in the Eastern hemisphere. Two species are however peculiar to the islands--Mabuia seychellensis and M. wrightii. The other peculiar species is one of the geckoes (Geckotidæ) named Æluronyx seychellensis, and there are also three other geckoes, Phelsuma madagascarensis, Gehyra mutilata and Hemidactylus frenatus, the two latter having a wide distribution in the tropical regions of both hemispheres. These lizards, clinging as they do to trees and timber, are exceedingly liable to be carried in ships from one country to another, and I am told by Dr. Günther that some are found almost every year in the London Docks. It is therefore probable, that when species of this family have a very wide range they have been assisted in their migrations by man, though their habit of clinging to trees also renders them likely to be floated with large pieces of timber to considerable distances. Dr. Percival Wright, to whom I am indebted for much information on the productions of the Seychelles Archipelago, informs me that the last-named species varies greatly in colour in the different islands, so that he could always tell from which particular island a specimen had been brought. This is analogous to the curious fact of certain lizards on the small islands in the Mediterranean being always very different in colour from those of the mainland, usually becoming rich blue or black (see Nature, Vol. XIX. p. 97); and we thus learn how readily in some cases differences of colour are brought about, either directly or indirectly, by local conditions.|$|E
