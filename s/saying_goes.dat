If you want to study Mandarin, come to Beijing. If you want to study standard Mandarin, come to Harbin.'). The Harbin local culture is based on Han culture, combined with Manchu culture and Russian culture. This combination of cultures influences the local architecture style, food, music, and customs. The city of Harbin was appointed a UNESCO City of Music on 22 June 2010 as part of the Creative Cities Network.|$|E

2500|$|From the {{perspective}} of modern science, the main obstacle {{to the evolution of}} speech-like communication in nature is not a mechanistic one.

The problem of reliability was not recognised at all by Darwin, Müller or the other early evolutionist theorists.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the 1930s and 1940s the Yi people (also {{known as}} Nuosu) of China terrorized Sichuan to rob and enslave non-Nuosu {{including}} Han people. The {{descendants of the}} Han Chinese slaves are the White Yi (白彝) and they outnumber the Black Yi (黑彝) aristocracy by ten to one. As much as {{tens of thousands of}} Han slaves were incorporated into Nuosu society every year. The Han slaves and their offspring were used for manual labor.

2500|$|Saudade is also {{associated}} with Galicia, where it is used similarly to the word morriña (longingness). Yet, morriña often implies a deeper stage of saudade, a [...] "saudade so strong it can even kill," [...] as the Galician <b>saying</b> <b>goes.</b> Morriña was a term often used by emigrant Galicians when talking about the Galician motherland they left behind. Although saudade is also a Galician word, the meaning of longing for something that might return is generally associated with morriña. A literary example showing {{the understanding of the}} difference and the use of both words is the song Un canto a Galicia by Julio Iglesias. The word used by Galicians speaking Spanish has spread and become common in all Spain and even accepted by the Academia.|$|E

The controversial story of Luke raping Laura had quickly been renounced to a seduction at the time, after facing pressure from fans of the newly popular couple. In 1998, Pat Fili-Krushel, then President of Daytime Programming for ABC Daytime, explained to The New York Times: [...] "What we felt we should investigate is how, as the famous <b>saying</b> <b>goes,</b> {{the sins of the}} father are visited on the children."

2500|$|A {{propensity}} {{theory of}} probability was given by Charles Sanders Peirce. A later propensity theory was proposed by philosopher Karl Popper, who had only slight acquaintance with the writings of C.S. Peirce, however. Popper noted that {{the outcome of a}} physical experiment is produced by a certain set of [...] "generating conditions". [...] When we repeat an experiment, as the <b>saying</b> <b>goes,</b> we really perform another experiment with a (more or less) similar set of generating conditions. [...] To say that a set of generating conditions has propensity p of producing the outcome E means that those exact conditions, if repeated indefinitely, would produce an outcome sequence in which E occurred with limiting relative frequency p. [...] For Popper then, a deterministic experiment would have propensity 0 or 1 for each outcome, since those generating conditions would have same outcome on each trial. [...] In other words, non-trivial propensities (those that differ from 0 and 1) only exist for genuinely indeterministic experiments.|$|E

2500|$|Šljivovica (Slivovitz) is the {{national}} drink of Serbia in domestic production for centuries, and plum is {{the national}} fruit. The international name Slivovitz is derived from Serbian. Plum and its products are of great importance to Serbs and part of numerous customs. A Serbian meal usually starts or ends with plum products and Šljivovica is served as an aperitif. A <b>saying</b> <b>goes</b> that {{the best place to}} build a house is where a plum tree grows best. [...] Traditionally, Šljivovica (commonly referred to as [...] "rakija") is connected to Serbian culture as a drink used at all important rites of passage (birth, baptism, military service, marriage, death, etc.), and in the Serbian Orthodox patron saint celebration (slava). It is used in numerous folk remedies, and is given certain degree of respect above all other alcoholic drinks. The fertile region of Šumadija in central Serbia is particularly known for its plums and Šljivovica. Serbia is the largest exporter of Slivovitz in the world, and second largest plum producer in the world.|$|E
2500|$|Thus, Māgha's {{attempt to}} surpass Bharavi {{appears to have}} been successful; even his name seems to be derived from this feat: another Sanskrit <b>saying</b> <b>goes</b> tāvat bhā bhāraveḥ bhāti yāvat māghasya nodayaḥ, which can mean [...] "the lustre of the sun lasts until the advent of Maagha (the coldest month of winter)", but also [...] "the lustre of Bharavi lasts until the advent of Māgha". However, Māgha follows Bhāravi's {{structure}} too closely, and the long-windedness of his descriptions loses the gravity and [...] "weight of meaning" [...] found in Bhāravi's poem. Consequently, Māgha is more admired as a poet than the work is as a whole, and the sections of the work that may be considered digressions from the story have the nature of an anthology and are more popular. His work is also considered to be difficult, and reading it and Meghadūta can easily consume one's lifetime, according to the saying (sometimes attributed to Mallinātha) māghe meghe gataṃ vayaḥ.

2500|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the Ui Fidgenti circa 377 a.d., there were few significant changes in political control until the arrival of the Vikings in the 9th century, which ultimately brought about {{the establishment}} of the city on an island on the River Shannon in 922. The death of Domnall Mór Ua Briain, King of Munster in 1194 resulted in the invading Normans taking control of Limerick, and in 1210, the County of Limerick was formally established as Ui Fidgenti lands were granted to what would become the Fitzgerald dynasty. [...] Over time, the Normans became [...] "more Irish than the Irish themselves" [...] as the <b>saying</b> <b>goes.</b> The Tudors in England wanted to curb the power of these Gaelicised Norman Rulers and centralise all power in their hands, so they established colonies of English in the county. Distrust by England of the leading Fitzgerald families, and the execution of the several of the Fitzgeralds of Kildare, precipitated a revolt against English Rule in 1569. Th resultant savage war in Munster, known as the Desmond Rebellions, laid waste to the province, and ended with confiscation of the vast estates of the Geraldines and other Irish families that had participated in the ten years of war.|$|E

Miranda {{is not to be}} missed. [...] the old <b>saying</b> <b>goes,</b> it takes talent to be that bad". Another commentator wrote similarly: [...] "It's so awful, it's brilliant."

TheaterJones noted that Ballinger: [...] "has hit on a character that reflects the zeitgeist of our time and does it with tongue firmly planted in cheek." [...] In 2015, Playbill concluded: [...] "Miranda Sings is a huge talent. With very demonstrative facial expressions, a unique take on makeup and wardrobe and her almost unbelievable vocal stylings, she cuts an undeniable figure in the world of online music video."

2500|$|In October 1970, {{shortly after}} the birth of their only child Tamala Georgette, Jones was straitjacketed and {{committed}} to a padded cell at the Watson Clinic in Lakeland, Florida, after a drunken bender; he was kept there to detoxify for 10 days before being released with a prescription for Librium. Jones managed longer stretches of sobriety with Wynette than he had enjoyed in years but as the decade wore on his drinking and erratic behavior worsened, leading to the couple's divorce in 1976. Jones accepted the responsibility for the failure of the marriage but vehemently denied Wynette's allegations in her autobiography that he beat her and fired a shotgun at her. Remarkably, Jones and Wynette continued playing shows and drawing crowds in the years after their divorce, as fans began to see their songs mirroring their stormy relationship. [...] In 1980, they recorded the album Together Again and scored a hit with [...] "Two Story House". Jones also spoke publicly about his hopes for a reconciliation and would jokingly reference Tammy in some of his songs - during performances of his 1981 hit [...] "If Drinkin' Don't Kill Me (Her Memory Will)" [...] he would sing [...] "Tammy's memory will" [...] - but the recrimination continued unabated. [...] After years of sniping, Jones and Wynette appeared to make peace in the 1990s, recording a final album, One, and even touring together again before Wynette's death in 1998. [...] In 1995 Jones told Country Weekly, [...] "Like the old <b>saying</b> <b>goes,</b> it takes time to heal things and they've been healed quite a while." ...|$|E
