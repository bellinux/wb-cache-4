5|$|Kimberella dwelt {{in shallow}} waters (up {{to tens of}} meters in depth), sharing the calm, well-oxygenated sea floor with {{photosynthetic}} organisms and microbial mats. Assemblages bearing Kimberella often also bear fossils of Andiva, Yorgia, Dickinsonia, Tribrachidium and Charniodiscus, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> lived alongside these organisms.|$|E
5|$|Afrasia {{has only}} {{been found in the}} Eocene Pondaung Formation of central Myanmar, a rock unit which has been dated to about 37 million years ago using magnetostratigraphy and fission track dating. This places it {{at the end of the}} Bartonian stage, near the Middle–Late Eocene boundary. Although many tons of sediments in the area have been {{screened}} for fossils, Afrasia is still known only from four teeth, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a rare species.|$|E
50|$|The broad {{anterior}} teeth and slender posterior teeth of Concavispina <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> fed on soft-bodied {{animals such as}} fish and jellyfish while the pointed {{anterior teeth}} and broad posterior teeth of Xinpusaurus <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> fed on harder prey with shells.|$|R
50|$|Records <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was rarely}} worn.|$|R
50|$|The {{size of its}} osteocytic lacunae <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had {{a fairly}} large genome (C-value of about 36.7 pg, with a 95% {{confidence}} interval ranging from 30.2 to 44.2 pg), though not as large as that of obligatorily neotenic extant urodeles. This <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may have been facultatively neotenic.|$|R
5|$|Fra Mauro {{is thought}} to have been formed from ejecta, or debris, from the impact which formed Mare Imbrium. During Apollo 14, the crew members sampled ejecta from Cone crater, a feature close in {{proximity}} to the immediate landing site of the mission, which provided insight into the composition of material deep inside the formation. Data from the mission has helped to determine the approximate age of Mare Imbrium, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is no more than about 4.25 billion years old.|$|E
5|$|It seems {{curious that}} a text so {{obviously}} written {{with the expectation}} that it would be widely copied should exist in only one manuscript and that, apparently, a draft. Treharne has taken this as <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is not only modern readers who have found the work tedious (Treharne 2000, p.273). Orm, however, says in the preface that he wishes Walter to remove any wording that he finds clumsy or incorrect (quoted in Bennett and Smithers 1982, pp.175–76).|$|E
5|$|Kelsey Munro {{reviewed}} {{the book in}} the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is pessimistic and does not present any false hope. But he says pessimism {{is not the same}} thing as fatalism, and Hamilton believes there is still an urgent need for government intervention to avoid worst-case scenarios by reducing emissions. Munro also points out that some eminent climate scientists, like Princeton University's Michael Oppenheimer, remain optimistic that humanity will act before it is too late.|$|E

50|$|The {{occurrence}} of incipient seafloor spreading {{in the basin}} is under controversy. Some researchers <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> does not occur within the basin because of the crustal thickness, magnetic anomaly patterns, and intracrustal diapirism. Other geoscientists <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is occurring and is related to seamount volcanism and normal faulting within the basin.|$|R
5|$|The royal tomb {{found in}} the royal palace G is {{designated}} hypogeum G4; it dates to the archive period, most probably the reign of Isar-Damu. The tomb is heavily damaged; most of its stones were sacked and nothing of the roof system remains. It also lacks any skeletal remains or funerary goods <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was either heavily pillaged, never used, or was built as a cenotaph.|$|E
5|$|Whether the bigeye and {{smalltooth}} sand tigers {{belong in}} the same family as the superficially similar sand tiger shark (C. taurus) has been debated among systematists, with morphological and dentitional studies giving inconsistent results. A 2012 molecular phylogenetic analysis, based on mitochondrial DNA, supported a sister species relationship between O. noronhai and O. ferox but not a clade consisting of Odontaspis and Carcharias. Instead, Odontaspis was found to be closer to the crocodile shark (Pseudocarcharias kamoharai), <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> and Carcharias should be placed in separate families.|$|E
5|$|A {{report in}} 1997 {{described}} use of sponges {{as a tool}} by bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay in Western Australia. A dolphin will attach a marine sponge to its rostrum, which is presumably then used to protect it when searching for food in the sandy sea bottom. The behavior, known as sponging, has only been observed in this bay, and is almost exclusively shown by females. A study in 2005 concluded that mothers teach the behavior to their daughters, and that all the sponge-users are closely related, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is a fairly recent innovation.|$|E

500|$|Other {{proposals}} were more physical in nature. As mentioned above, William Parks <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was joined to the vertebrae with ligaments or muscles, and helped with moving {{and supporting the}} head. Othenio Abel proposed it {{was used as a}} weapon in combat among members of the same species, and Andrew Milner <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{could be used as a}} foliage deflector, like the helmet crest (called a 'casque') of the cassowary. Still other proposals made housing specialized organs the major function. Halszka Osmólska <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> housed salt glands, and John Ostrom <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> housed expanded areas for olfactory tissue and much improved sense of smell of the lambeosaurines, which had no obvious defensive capabilities. One unusual suggestion, made by creationist Duane Gish, is that the crest housed chemical glands <b>that</b> allowed <b>it</b> to throw jets of chemical [...] "fire" [...] at enemies, similar to the modern-day bombardier beetle.|$|R

5|$|Although the skulls are incompletely preserved, CT {{scanning}} {{suggests that}} each premaxilla held five incisors, with the sockets becoming progressively larger {{from the first}} to the fifth incisor. Like other theriodonts, the crowns of the incisors are conical; they also lack serrations, unlike gorgonopsians and scylacosaurian therocephalians. The interior edge of the incisors seems to be slightly concave, and the back edge {{appears to have a}} ridge. The smaller specimen has a displaced incisor preserved within its nasal cavity; it is more strongly recurved and has wear marks on its top edge, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is probably a lower incisor. Its fourth incisor also has a replacement tooth growing behind it, accompanied by resorption of the root.|$|E
5|$|Due to misunderstandings {{caused by}} the 2009 {{publication}} of the star's 15% contraction, apparently of its outer atmosphere, Betelgeuse has frequently {{been the subject of}} scare stories and rumors <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> will explode within a year, leading to exaggerated claims about the consequences of such an event. The timing and prevalence of these rumors have been linked to broader misconceptions of astronomy, particularly to doomsday predictions relating to the Mayan calendar. Betelgeuse is not likely to produce a gamma-ray burst and is not close enough for its x-rays, ultraviolet radiation, or ejected material to cause significant effects on Earth.|$|E
5|$|In 1258, a {{group of}} barons seized power from Henry in a coup d'état, citing the need to {{strictly}} enforce Magna Carta and the Charter of the Forest, creating a new baronial-led government to advance reform through the Provisions of Oxford. The barons were not militarily powerful enough to win a decisive victory, and instead appealed to Louis IX of France in 1263–1264 to arbitrate on their proposed reforms. The reformist barons argued their case based on Magna Carta, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was inviolable under English law and that the King had broken its terms.|$|E

50|$|Henodus, however, {{differs from}} other placodonts in having {{developed}} unique baleen-like denticles, which alongside {{features of the}} hyoid and jaw musculature <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a filter feeder. Recent comparisons to Atopodentatus <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a herbivore as well, bearing a similar broad jaw shape, albeit it obtained plant matter through filter-feeding it from the substrates.|$|R
5|$|In its path, Charlie {{caused more}} than 250 deaths. The {{hurricane}} produced Jamaica's deadliest natural disaster of the 20th century, causing more than 152 deaths and $50,000,000 in damages. The hurricane {{was described as}} Tampico's worst tropical cyclone since 1936, and it caused more than 100 fatalities in the surrounding areas. Many bodies were not recovered after flooding. The hurricane produced peak gusts of 160mph (260km/h) at the airport, and its strongest sustained winds were unmeasured in mainland Mexico, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{may have been a}} Category4 hurricane at landfall.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, a {{paramilitary}} {{group known as}} Combat 18 (C18) was formed to protect BNP events from anti-fascist protesters. Tyndall was displeased that by 1992, C18 was having an increased influence over the BNP's street activities. Relations between the groups deteriorated such that by August 1993, activists from the BNP and C18 were physically fighting each other. In December 1993, Tyndall issued a bulletin to BNP branches declaring C18 to be a proscribed organisation, furthermore <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may have been established by agents {{of the state to}} discredit the party. To counter C18's influence, he secured the American white nationalist militant William Pierce as a guest speaker at the BNP's annual rally in November 1995.|$|E
5|$|It may {{always have}} been thinly spread, {{but there has been}} {{widespread}} deforestation within its range resulting in loss and fragmentation of suitable habitat. The rail has been protected under Indonesian law since 1972, and the large Lore Lindu and Bogani Nani Wartabone National Parks are within its range, but logging and rattan cutting occurs even in these protected areas, and human encroachment is also a problem at Lore Lindu. The rail has been trapped for food in the past, and is sometimes killed by dogs, cats and other introduced predators. A 2007 survey of protected areas of Sulawesi failed to find the rail, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is genuinely rare even in reserves.|$|E
50|$|The precise {{date and}} {{location}} of composition is disputed: some <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was written in Salzburg, the boy's home town, in 1762 or 1763; others <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was written in Paris in 1763 or 1764, during Mozart's first visit to <b>that</b> city. <b>It</b> was published in Paris in February 1764, along with another violin sonata, K. 7, as Mozart's “Opus 1”.|$|R

5|$|Lactarius blennius (commonly {{known as}} the Slimy Milkcap or Beech Milkcap) is a {{medium-sized}} mushroom of the genus Lactarius found commonly in beech forests in Europe, where it is mycorrhizal, favouring the European Beech (though associations with other trees are known). It was first described by Elias Magnus Fries. Though its colour and size vary, it is distinctive because it is slimy when wet and exudes copious amounts of milk. It {{has been the subject}} of some chemical research, and it can be used to produce pigments and blennins. Blennins, some of which have shown potential medical application, are derived from lactarane, a chemical so named because of their association with Lactarius. The edibility of L.blennius is uncertain, with different mycologists <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is edible (though not recommended), inedible or even poisonous.|$|E
5|$|Mascarene martins will mob the Mauritius kestrel, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is {{perceived}} as a potential predator. Martins on Mauritius may be infected by an endemic trypanosome, Trypanosoma phedinae, although the pathogenicity is unknown. Protozoan blood parasites of the genus Haemoproteus have also been found in the martin on Mauritius, although no blood parasites were found in a Madagascan specimen. A new species of louse fly, Ornithomya cecropis, was first found on a martin in Madagascar, and another bird from that island carried the feather mite Mesalges hirsutus, more commonly found in parrots.|$|E
5|$|Maya stone {{sculpture}} {{emerged into}} {{the archaeological record}} as a fully developed tradition, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may have evolved from a tradition of sculpting wood. Because of the biodegradability of wood, the corpus of Maya woodwork has almost entirely disappeared. The few wooden artefacts that have survived include three-dimensional sculptures, and hieroglyphic panels. Stone Maya stelae are widespread in city sites, often paired with low, circular stones referred to as altars in the literature. Stone sculpture also took other forms, such as the limestone relief panels at Palenque and Piedras Negras. At Yaxchilan, Dos Pilas, Copán, and other sites, stone stairways were decorated with sculpture. The hieroglyphic stairway at Copán comprises the longest surviving Maya hieroglyphic text, and consists of 2,200 individual glyphs.|$|E
