This would cause <b>Student</b> <b>A</b> to view the goal as an ideal that satisfies their need for accomplishment. <b>Student</b> B uses <b>a</b> prevention-focus orientation where the goal is {{something that should be}} realized because it fulfills their need for security, protection and prevention of negative outcomes. <b>Student</b> <b>A</b> uses an eager approach where they read extra materials to obtain their goal of <b>an</b> <b>A.</b> <b>Student</b> B uses <b>a</b> vigilant approach where they become more detail oriented and pay careful attention to completing all of the course requirements.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{studies the}} {{influence}} of Writing RoadmapTM 2. 0 (WRM) and teacher grading on <b>student</b> <b>A</b> and <b>Student</b> B respectively. By comparing the grades of pre-tests of both students, we found that, in the post-test essays, <b>student</b> <b>A</b> demonstrated much achievement in word choice, fluency and conventions while student B showed little improvement in these three dimensions. Compared with <b>student</b> B, <b>student</b> <b>A's</b> essay was superior to that of student B in the above three dimensions as well. The comparative research indicates that the feedback given by the WRM helped <b>student</b> <b>A</b> improve his writing proficiency effectively, especially in word choice, syntax, spelling and grammar. But the system couldn’t provide <b>student</b> <b>A</b> with enough feedback and revision suggestions on ideas and contents as well as organization. On the contrary, the global scoring adopted by the teacher could only provide student B with limited feedback, thus was of little help to improve his writing quality...|$|R

5|$|Barnard's Inn, {{originally}} {{known as}} Mackworth's Inn after its owner, John Mackworth, {{was established in}} 1454 as an Inn of Chancery. A large Inn, Barnard's had 112 <b>students</b> <b>a</b> year {{during the reign of}} Elizabeth I with 24 in permanent residence. When it was an institute of legal education, it enforced the odd practice of fining a student when he got something wrong: a halfpenny for a defective word, a farthing for a defective syllable and a penny for an improper word. Barnard's was under the supervision of Gray's Inn, who traditionally sent a Reader to the Inn every year, who was treated with great respect. Noted pupils included Sir John Holt, later a distinguished jurist. The Inn was badly damaged in the Gordon Riots after a rioter set fire to the distillery next door. In 1880 it was bought by the Worshipful Company of Mercers and used to house the Mercers' School.|$|E
