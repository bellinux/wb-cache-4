It is well known that bone has no pain fibers, while surrounding connective tissues are abundantly supplied with pain fibers. In metabolic fractures, which can take place with ordinary infant handling, surrounding connective tissue is not involved. In traumatic fractures, surrounding connective tissues are torn resulting in significant pain, as anyone who has experienced a sprained ankle or traumatic rib fractures can testify.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Hard-to-forecast deep slab {{avalanches}} can release unpredictably under diverse conditions {{ranging from}} storms to clear days to locally induced stress to the snowpack. For {{the formation of}} many natural avalanches, a point is reached where the mass loading of overlying snow overpowers the mechanical properties of the weak layer. This can occur from additional loading above the weak layer, such as from precipitation or wind loading. Furthermore, natural failure can occur from solar warming and temperature variations. External stresses applied to the snowpack from skiers, snowmobilers, and other forces can also trigger deep slab avalanches. We collected field measurements of {{the properties of the}} failure layers and slab load to determine trends and correlations between such variables. The failure planes were analyzed using the deep tap test, propagation <b>saw</b> test, <b>shear</b> frame tests, and hand hardness and the overlying loads were calculated using density measurements. Spatial variability across the crowns was also assessed by use of multiple profiles and tests. Deep tap tests consistently yielded sudden (Q 1) fractures and the cut length in the PST was usually less than 60 % of the column length when the fracture propagated to the end. Preliminary results on spatial variability indicate that DT and shear frame results tended to increase with slab depth at some deep slab locations and crown thickness typically varied substantially. Locations with a thin snowpack, such as near rocky cliffs, were likely trigger points for some of the deep slab avalanches...|$|R
40|$|Since 1985 {{when the}} first robot PUMA 560 was {{employed}} to place a needle during a brain CT biopsy, surgical robots have become ubiquitous in clinical surgeries. Despite its advantages and success in surgeries, the interactions between the robot and the surgeons remain deficient, especially for the pressure sensing which plays an important role. Inspired by our previous work on bacterial sensing, in the current work I have designed, fabricated, analyzed, and evaluated an innovative prototype pressure sensor based on Aluminum Nitride (AlN) Surface Acoustic Wave (<b>SAW)</b> and <b>Shear</b> Horizontal (SH) -SAW. This AlN-based device has unique superiority over other SAW devices, including relatively lower cost, higher sensitivity, intrinsically higher reliability, more compact size, and faster response. In this novel design a sandwich-like structure is adopted and the AlN thin film on the top is used as the insulated layer to make the device applicable in aqueous environment. The delta function analysis and structural mechanics analysis have been performed to validate the proposed design scheme qualitatively. So as to make a quantitative and comprehensive analysis, the numerical computational analysis using finite element method (FEM) {{has been carried out}} using the software package COMSOL Multiphysics®. The 2 D plane-strain simulation and 3 D simplified model simulation have been executed to analyze the device performance with or without insulator. A good agreement has been achieved between the simulation and the experimental measurements, which validates the design scheme and establishes the effectiveness of the device. This SAW/SH-SAW device has been fabricated in the WSU SSIM clean room. The crystalline AlN thin film is deposited on A-plane sapphire with 2 µm thickness using the PSMBE system. The aluminum interdigital transducer (IDT) is evaporated on the AlN thin film with predefined delay-line pattern using the BJD- 1800 vacuum deposition system. Another layer of AlN thin film with 1 µm thickness is deposited {{on the top of the}} IDT area with some customized masks to make the device insulated. Furthermore, the differential frequency measurement system has been set up using electronic components to evaluate the system. Several signal processing algorithms are developed and compared to acquire system output. The thermal stability of the differential system is also studied and temperature compensation is developed to improve system robustness. The portable electrical circuit involving the frequency measurement system is finally designed and evaluated. Such a sensor could serve as a key component in artificial skin or be equipped on the end of a surgical robotic arm in the future...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{acoustic}} wave (SAW) devices {{based on the}} piezoelectric principle have been used extensively in telecommunication applications over the last 20 years, but have recently shown promise {{in the area of}} biomedical applications due to their efficient micro-fluidic functions and highly sensitive and label-free detection of pathogens, bacteria, cells, DNA and proteins. There are two types of surface {{acoustic wave}} modes: i. e., Rayleigh <b>SAW</b> (R-SAW) and <b>shear</b> horizontal <b>SAW</b> (SH-SAW). R-SAW is widely used for microfluidics and sensing in dry conditions, whereas SH-SAW is mainly used for sensing in liquid conditions. This thesis firstly reviewed the current theoretical and research progress related to these devices and application within the biomedical fields to date, and then the SH-SAW was applied into a novel lab-on-chip combining both bio-sensing and micro-fluidic functions. Simulations of the SH-SAW propagation on 36 o Y-cut LiTaO 3 were undertaken. Results showed a weak vertical wave component, and at a 90 ° rotation cut, the crystal was able to support a vertical Rayleigh component showing mixed sensing and streaming possibilities on a single crystal. Experimental investigation of the SH-SAW identified the ability for the shear wave to support mixing, pumping, heating, nebulisation and ejection of sessile droplets {{on the surface of the}} crystal with a theoretical explanation for the behaviour presented. A comparison with a standard R-SAW devices made of 128 o Y-cut LiNbO 3 and sputtered ZnO films was performed.

40|$|AbstractPersistent deep slab {{avalanches}} {{are generally}} hard to forecast and can release under diverse conditions ranging from storms to clear days to locally induced {{stress on the}} snowpack. For the formation of many natural avalanches, a point is reached where the mass loading of overlying snow exceeds the mechanical properties of the weak layer. This can occur from additional loading above the weak layer, such as from precipitation or wind loading. Furthermore, natural failure can occur from solar warming and temperature variations. External stresses applied to the snowpack from skiers, snowmobilers, and other forces can also trigger deep slab avalanches. We accessed and made field measurements at 41 persistent deep slab avalanches that released after the avalanche cycle of the respective persistent weak layer. These measurements included {{the properties of the}} failure layers, slab load, and preceding weather to determine trends and correlations between such variables. The failure planes were analyzed using the Deep Tap test (DT), Propagation <b>Saw</b> Test (PST), <b>shear</b> frame tests, and hand hardness. The overlying loads were calculated using density measurements. Spatial variability across the crowns was also assessed by the use of multiple profiles and tests. Precipitation, temperature, and wind data were obtained from the nearest automatic weather station to the respective avalanche start zone. DTs often yielded sudden (Q 1) fractures and the cut length in PSTs was usually less than 60 % of the column length when the fracture propagated to the end. Tests were repeated at multiple sites for a few deep slab avalanches and they indicated that DT taps and shear strength of the failure layer tended to increase with crown height. Crown height typically varied substantially at each deep slab avalanche. Preceding weather prior to the accessed deep slab avalanches showed an increase in precipitation and change in temperature for some releases and little change in wind speed and direction for many releases...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in nanotechnology including fabrication, measurement and characterization have enabled {{the discovery of}} interesting and novel phenomena at the nanoscale, in particular transport through fabricated nanochannels. There are many advantages of scaling down the laboratory below the sub-millimeter range, such as faster reaction rates due to the larger surface-to-volume ratio, smaller sample volume, high throughput, potentially low cost by utilizing mass production, and capability for compact and portable analysis systems. As the channel dimension goes down to the nanometer scale, unique properties emerge, for example, overlapped electric double layers, reduced electroosmotic flow, increased viscosity, ion current rectification, ion enrichment and depletion. These novel transport properties of solvents and solutes/ions through nanochannels emerge from the combination of strong confinement and interactions with the channel inner surfaces on the nanoscale. As a prerequisite {{to the development of}} nanofluidic devices and discovering novel transport phenomena, various nanofabrication techniques have been investigated by many researchers for decades. However, the available technologies used to fabricate nanochannels are often expensive, time consuming, or simply not accurate enough. This creates a need for controlled yet simple, cost-effective, rapid, and scalable fabrication technologies. In this dissertation, we report three novel phenomena discovered by fabrication and/or characterization of nanofluidics with graphene and piezoelectric-based materials. In the first approach, a dry and rapid (∼ 10 s) method was used to deagglomerate bulk, unbound multi-walled carbon nanotube (CNT) bundles into individual CNTs aligned along a common axis using surface acoustic waves (<b>SAW)</b> and bulk <b>shear</b> along a piezoelectric substrate. The underlying mechanism was carefully investigated. The process first forms 1 μm CNT bundles from extremely large (∼ 10 Mm/s 2) mechanical accelerations due to the SAW; these bundles are consequently susceptible to SAW-induced evanescent, quasistatic electric fields that couple into the bundles and form a mat of long (1 − 10 μm) individual CNTs on the substrate surface. These CNTs were then aligned along the direction of shear provided by sliding a glass cover slip 10 mm across the CNT mat. This alignment is notably independent of the SAW propagation direction. Further, the intrinsic structure of the nanotubes was unaffected as verified using Raman spectroscopy. Uniquely simple, the approach avoids the many shortcomings of other CNT deagglomeration techniques−particularly surface modification and suspension in solution−to rapidly separate and align large numbers of CNTs, thereby overcoming a key limitation in their use for a diverse range of applications. In the second approach, we discovered a quite anomalous rectification behaviour in nanochannels that make up the interstitial layers between the sheets that comprise a thin graphene oxide film. Structurally symmetric, two-dimensional multilayered graphene oxide films were shown {{for the first time to}} exhibit peculiar ion current rectification and nonlinear current-voltage characteristics below a critical electrolyte concentration. We attribute the unexpected rectification behavior to the fore-aft asymmetry (i. e. asymmetry across the length of film) that arises in the diffusion boundary layer on both sides of the millimeter long film upon reversal between the high resistance positive bias state and the low resistance negative bias state, the asymmetry being primarily a consequence of the trapping and release of counterions within the film, compounded by the nonuniform electric field that occurs in the tortuous nanochannels within the film. In addition, the influence of applied bias voltage and the electrolyte concentration and pH on the ion transport and ectification factor were studied. Furthermore, we showed how the nonlinear current-voltage characteristics and, in particular, ion current rectification in these platforms can be enhanced about 2 - 3 times through simple ways through which the asymmetry in the system can be additionally increased. Three sources of asymmetries were introduced to the system, including geometrical asymmetry, solution pH asymmetry, and solution ionic concentration asymmetry. Last but not least, we demonstrated, for the first time, the possibility for the generation of osmotic power through salinity gradients using these planar graphene-based devices. These first graphene-based nanofluidic rectifiers, which are easily synthesized, therefore offer a flexible, robust, low cost, and facile large-scale alternative to conventional nanochannels that require elaborate and sophisticated nanofabrication. In the third approach, for the first time, study of transport phenomena in a nanogap confining the fluid on a vibrating solid surface, which has an extremely high surface acceleration, became possible by integrating surface acoustic waves generated on a piezoelectric substrate (Lithium Niobate, LN) and planar nanofluidic channels milled in the same piezoelectric material. A facile deep reactive ion etching technique was used to form various high aspect ratio (width to depth), planar nanochannels in LN with depths down to the nanometer scale. A LN-LN bonding method was developed to seal the nanochannel on the vibrating surface. Finally, the sealing of the final device was tested by pumping water and fluorescent dye through the nanochannel. Fluid pumping and formation of chaotic flow in this acoustic nanofluidic system are reported. In addition, using transparent piezoelectric materials enables both electrical and optical characterization of fluids within the nanochannels. This acoustic nanofluidic system can be used for rapid mixing, detection and fast mass or ions transport at the nanoscale overcoming the major drawback of most micro- nanofluidic systems: the slow and highly laminar flow present inside the nanochannels...|$|R
