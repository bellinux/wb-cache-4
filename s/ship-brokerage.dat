5000|$|The {{ship was}} advertised for sale by the Marine <b>ship-brokerage</b> firm Norse Shore for {{the sum of}} GBP 20,000; the ridiculously low figure was {{explained}} by Norse Shore as being due to the vessel requiring partial dismantling {{in order to be}} moved from Alexandra Dock. Norse Shore admitted that NE Lincolnshire council had declared that the vessel had no historic interest to them at all, and as responsibility for the dock rested with the council, they were refusing to transfer the existing lease without payment of a bond of GBP 50,000, in effect a guarantee from a new lessee.|$|E
