5000|$|... 2013 will long {{be remembered}} in Loughmore-Castleiney as the Club gained {{immortality}} {{by winning the}} Senior Football Championship for the 12th time and also won the Senior Hurling Championship for good measure, thus becoming the first club to win both championships in the same year, a feat unlikely to be matched by another club in the foreseeable future. Loughmore-Castleiney's famous victory came at Semple Stadium on Sunday, 3 November, when their three-goal tally comfortably saw off the challenge of Aherlow Gaels which is a combination team representing the Aherlow and Lattin-Cullen clubs in West Tipperary. 2014 {{proved to be a}} disappointing year in the administration of the Club Championship as the fixture list was upset because of inter-county hurling commitments which resulted in the County being unable {{to take part in the}} Munster Club Football Championship, a fate strangely not visited upon the hurling clubs in the County. The County championship was eventually decided on <b>St.</b> <b>Stephens</b> <b>Day</b> following a replayed County final when the Loughmore-Casteleiny club successfully defended their title against a gallant Cahir team on a score of 0-9 to 2-2.|$|E
5000|$|Systematic {{persecution}} of the Jews in Sicily {{started in the}} 14th century. In 1310 the King of Sicily Frederick II of Aragon adopted a restrictive and discriminatory policy towards the Jews, who were required to mark their clothes and their shops with the [...] "red wheel". Jews were also forbidden any relationship with Catholics. In 1392, Jews were ordered to live in ghettos and severe persecutions broke out in Monte San Giuliano (now Erice), Catania and Syracuse, in which many Jews fell victim. The next year strict decrees were directed against private ceremonies. For example, Jews were forbidden to use any decorations in connection with funerals; except in unusual cases, when silk was permitted, the coffin might be covered with a woolen pall only. In Marsala, Jews were compelled {{to take part in}} the festival services at Christmas and on <b>St.</b> <b>Stephens</b> <b>Day,</b> and were then followed home by the mob and stoned on the way. At the beginning of the 15th century oppression was at such a level that in 1402 the Jews of Marsala presented an appeal to the king, in which they asked for: (1) exemption from compulsory menial services; (2) the reduction of their taxes to one-eleventh of the total taxation, since the Jews were only one-eleventh of the population; (3) the hearing of their civil suits by the royal chief judge, and of their religious cases by the inquisitor; (4) the delivery of flags only to the superintendent of the royal castle, not to others; (5) the reopening of the womens bath, which had been closed under Andrea Chiaramonte. This appeal was granted.|$|E

40|$|The {{theme of}} the thesis, which you hold in your hands is {{particular}} situation of sermon {{on the occasion of}} December 26 th with its specific topic about the first Christian martyr <b>St.</b> <b>Stephen.</b> The aim of this work is to explore, in discussion with experts and current Protestant preachers, the homiletic possibilities of how such specific situation should be addressed. Master thesis has four main parts. The first part investigates how available homiletic literature operates with the key terms: preaching, celebration and Stephen. New Testament biblical texts associated with Stephen are processed in this part as well. The second, more practical part, deals with particular sermons of contemporary Slovak and Czech ministers, and invites them into a conversation about a particular situation of both <b>St.</b> <b>Stephen</b> and the listener who is being addressed with these sermons. The third part of the thesis provides conclusion. The annex is important as well, for it provides a collection of sermons on this particular subject.
