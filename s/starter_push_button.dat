2500|$|The 1949 {{model was}} {{equipped}} with an ignition key and a starter push-button to engage the <b>starter.</b> <b>Pushing</b> the <b>starter</b> <b>button</b> would engage the starter, but if the ignition key was not inserted, unlocking the ignition, the car would not start. The car {{was equipped with}} an oil bath air cleaner. At the bottom edge of the front fender directly behind the front wheel was a badge that said [...] "Futuramic" [...] which identified an Oldsmobile approach to simplified driving, {{and the presence of}} an automatic transmission. [...] Styling changes for the 1950 model include the replacement of a two-piece windshield with a one-piece unit and the addition of the Holiday hardtop coupe to the line. Also a three-speed manual transmission with column shift became available as a [...] "delete for credit" [...] option to the Hydra-Matic automatic transmission. The 88 now outsold the six-cylinder 76 lineup, which was dropped entirely after the 1950 model year. It had a 40ft. turning circle. [...] The 1950 model won the 1950 Carrera Panamericana.|$|R
5000|$|Starter: The starter has {{full control}} of the {{swimmers}} {{from the time the}} referee turns the swimmers over to him/her until the race commences. A starter begins the race by saying, [...] "Take your mark." [...] At this point, the swimmers will get into stationary positions in which they would like to start their race. After all swimmers have assumed their stationary position, the <b>starter</b> will <b>push</b> a <b>button</b> on the starting system, signaling the start of a race with a loud noise (usually a beep or a horn) and flash from a strobe light. A starter sends the swimmers off the blocks and may call a false start if a swimmer leaves the block before the starter sends them. A starter may also choose to recall the race after the start for any reason or request the swimmers to [...] "stand" [...] or [...] "relax" [...] (for backstroke/backcrawl events only) if he or she believes that (a) particular swimmer(s) has gotten an unfair advantage at the start.|$|R
