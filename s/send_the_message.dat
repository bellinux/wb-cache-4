25|$|A {{number of}} local police {{departments}} D.A.R.E. programs have police cars marked as DARE cars to promote their program. The D.A.R.E. cars appear at schools and in parades. Typically these cars are high-end or performance cars that have been seized in a drug raid. They are used to <b>send</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> that drug dealers forfeit all their glamorous trappings when they get caught. D.A.R.E. cars can also be regular police vehicles that are {{nearing the end of}} their service life, pressed into service for the promotion, or new police cars outfitted especially for the D.A.R.E. program.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{proposal}} of Mayor Yiannis Karousos, then President of the Ayia Napa Tourism Committee, on September 16, 2007, the world's longest chain of syrtaki dancers (a famous Greek dance) danced to Zorba the Greek in a successful attempt {{to enter the}} Guinness Book of World Records. The chain had a total of 268 members of eight groups dancing in step to Zorbas. Then Ayia Napa Mayor Antonis Tsokkos said {{the aim of the}} event was to <b>send</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> that the village was interested in Greek culture and to promote the tourist resort abroad. Head of the cultural services of the Municipality Maria Tofini said that according to the Guinness Book of World Records, the dancers had to perform in synchronised step for the attempt to qualify. The event drew the attention of tourists and locals, many of whom danced to Zorbas on the beach and in the sea.|$|E

However, due to security concerns the Academy announced that red carpet bleacher seats would now be limited on a reservation basis based on a random selection and a background check.

500|$|Architectural {{critics have}} given lukewarm reviews to the Central Saint Giles development.

[...] However, he expressed concern that the development would <b>send</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> that similar projects should convey [...] "a false sense of worth" [...] by being similarly dramatic. He criticised the way that the terracotta façades presented an overall effect that was [...] "neither beautiful enough, nor surreal enough, to be truly remarkable", presenting an effect that was [...] "striking but not resonant. Nothing about these façades lingers in the mind. They are, oddly, bereft of joie de vivre." ...|$|E

[...] Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen, in their book Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema, say the film was also inspired by the 1972 film, Dhakam, which starred R. Muthuraman and Pandari Bai. They also note that Aval Appadithan uses a [...] "fluid narrative style" [...] and music to mix flashbacks with vox-pop and [...] "glossy pictorialism". The film is an exception on stereotypes of women, as shown by paralleling an independent woman, Manju, and a pious traditional woman: Manju gets into problems while Arun's wife is happy.

500|$|With {{the attacks}} unfolding, air traffic {{officials}} began issuing warnings through the Aircraft Communication Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS). Ed Ballinger, the United flight dispatcher, began sending text cockpit warnings to United Airlines flights at 09:19, 17 minutes {{after he became}} aware of Flight 175's impact. As Ballinger was responsible for multiple flights, he did not <b>send</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> to Flight93 until 09:23. Ballinger received a routine ACARS message from Flight93 at 09:21. At 09:22, after learning of the events at the World Trade Center, LeRoy Homer's wife, Melody Homer, had an ACARS message sent to her husband in the cockpit asking if he was okay. At 09:24, Flight93 received Ballinger's ACARS warning, [...] "Beware any cockpit intrusion—two a/c [...] hit World Trade Center". At 09:26, Captain Jason Dahl sent an ACARS message back, [...] "Ed, confirm latest mssg plz —Jason". At 09:27:25, the flight crew responded to routine radio traffic from air traffic control.

500|$|The {{liner notes}} for Revelation {{state that the}} album art is [...] "an artistic interpretation" [...] of Salvation Mountain, a {{monument}} created by Leonard Knight as [...] "a public art project designed to <b>send</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> that 'God Loves Everyone'". Located in Calipatria, California, the location is entered in the Congressional Record as a 'national treasure'. The album cover is of Salvation Mountain with the song titles of Revelation composed on it, [...] "to send [...] own message of God's love to the world". According to bassist Tai Anderson, the idea to use Salvation Mountain as the album cover art was lead vocalist Mac Powell's idea. Anderson recalled that Third Day received critiques about the album art, with people claiming it ripped off the cover art of Radiohead's album Hail to the Thief (2003). Although he admits there [...] "are similarities" [...] between the two, Anderson denied that the band based the design off of [...] "outside sources". Anderson also said he was {{more concerned with the}} album art's coloring, as [...] "red-skewed" [...] album covers had been used by bands such as U2 and Green Day. In hindsight, Anderson felt that the band [...] "probably would have used one of the other images from the packaging on the cover just so we wouldn't have to read the one star critiques on iTunes which never reference the music, just the album cover".|$|E
500|$|Wikimedia Foundation {{spokesman}} {{and head}} of communications, Jay Walsh, stated the decision was focused on reducing hostility within the subject and getting articles back to an appropriate state. Walsh emphasized to Bloomberg BusinessWeek that edits which {{serve the interests of}} organizations are acceptable, but must be within the procedure of [...] "adding valuable context" [...] to articles. In a statement to The Wall Street Journal, Walsh said, [...] "This is about people reducing the hostility around the topic, and getting the articles back to a state where they make sense. I think the arbitration committee wants to <b>send</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> that Wikipedians have to be neutral on all accounts and all fronts. They don't take these situations lightly. They understand there's a perspective of: Are we censoring people or individuals? It's really about what can we do that's best for Wikipedia and the people who read it." [...] When asked by Ross Reynolds of National Public Radio affiliate KUOW-FM why the Arbitration decision included a [...] "ban on IP addresses at the Church of Scientology", Walsh answered, [...] "So the simple answer is that within looking at these computers and where these edits were coming from, the decision is that ultimately most of the edits within these ranges have been from single-user-accounts, people who have a single intention to change or move or in some cases remove information, which could be considered censorship, which is really something that doesn't work out well on Wikipedia. And this is an effort to kind of calm that effect, and to bring some neutrality and some quality back to these articles." ...|$|E
