25|$|The surface {{condenser}} is a <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> <b>tube</b> heat exchanger in which cooling water {{is circulated through}} the tubes. The exhaust steam from the low-pressure turbine enters the shell, where it is cooled and converted to condensate (water) by flowing over the tubes {{as shown in the}} adjacent diagram. Such condensers use steam ejectors or rotary motor-driven exhausts for continuous removal of air and gases from the steam side to maintain vacuum.|$|E
25|$|Baffle Design: baffles {{are used}} in <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> <b>tube</b> heat {{exchangers}} to direct fluid across the tube bundle. They run perpendicularly to the shell and hold the bundle, preventing the tubes from sagging over a long length. They can also prevent the tubes from vibrating. The {{most common type of}} baffle is the segmental baffle. The semicircular segmental baffles are oriented at 180 degrees to the adjacent baffles forcing the fluid to flow upward and downwards between the tube bundle. Baffle spacing is of large thermodynamic concern when designing <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> <b>tube</b> heat exchangers. Baffles must be spaced with consideration for the conversion of pressure drop and heat transfer. For thermo economic optimization it is suggested that the baffles be spaced no closer than 20% of the shell’s inner diameter. Having baffles spaced too closely causes a greater pressure drop because of flow redirection. Consequently, having the baffles spaced too far apart means that there may be cooler spots in the corners between baffles. It is also important to ensure the baffles are spaced close enough that the tubes do not sag. The other main type of baffle is the disc and doughnut baffle, which consists of two concentric baffles. An outer, wider baffle looks like a doughnut, whilst the inner baffle is shaped like a disk. This type of baffle forces the fluid to pass around each side of the disk then through the doughnut baffle generating a different type of fluid flow.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Shell</b> <b>and</b> <b>tube</b> heat {{exchangers}} consist of series of tubes. One set of these tubes contains the fluid {{that must be}} either heated or cooled. The second fluid runs over the tubes that are being heated or cooled {{so that it can}} either provide the heat or absorb the heat required. A set of tubes is called the tube bundle and can be made up of several types of tubes: plain, longitudinally finned, etc. <b>Shell</b> <b>and</b> <b>tube</b> {{heat exchangers}} are typically used for high-pressure applications (with pressures greater than 30 bar and temperatures greater than 260°C).

50|$|High heat {{transfer}} coefficients:-Another significant advantage is {{the relatively high}} {{heat transfer}} coefficient of this evaporator type. This is essential as it reduces the overall heat transfer area requirement which in turn will lower the initial capital cost of the evaporator. This is accentuated {{by the fact that}} the components, which consist of a <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> <b>tubes,</b> are easily obtainable with customized designs making them cost effective for construction and ideal for simple evaporation requirements. Moreover, this type of evaporator also can easily contain those widely available vapour separators for foaming products.|$|R
50|$|The Livermore team is also {{exploring}} new forming techniques (e.g. extrusion molding) {{which have}} the capacity to create more diverse, and possibly more complicated, shapes. These include <b>shells</b> <b>and</b> <b>tubes</b> for improved coupling to the pump light and for more efficient heat transfer. In addition, different materials can be co-extruded and then sintered into a monolithic transparent solid. An amplifier slab can formed so that part of the structure acts in guided lightwave transmission in order to focus pump light from laser diodes into regions with a high concentration of dopant ions near the slab center.|$|R
2500|$|When {{compared}} to <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> <b>tube</b> exchangers, the stacked-plate arrangement typically has lower volume and cost. Another {{difference between the}} two is that plate exchangers typically serve low to medium pressure fluids, {{compared to}} medium and high pressures of <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> <b>tube.</b> [...] A third and important difference is that plate exchangers employ more countercurrent flow rather than cross current flow, which allows lower approach temperature differences, high temperature changes, and increased efficiencies.|$|E

2500|$|A third type of heat {{exchanger}} is {{a plate and}} shell {{heat exchanger}}, which combines plate heat exchanger with <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> <b>tube</b> heat exchanger technologies. The heart of the heat exchanger contains a fully welded circular plate pack made by pressing and cutting round plates and welding them together.

In particular, it does completely without gaskets, which provides security against leakage at high pressures and temperatures.|$|E
2500|$|Cooling {{water systems}} are {{susceptible}} to fouling. Cooling water typically has a high total dissolved solids content and suspended colloidal solids.

40|$|AbstractBased on Chinese code GB 151 for {{the design}} of shell-and-tube heat exchangers, the {{tubesheets}} are usually very heavy. The reason is attributed to the oversimplified mechanical model for the calculation of the tubesheet thickness especially the insufficient consideration of the tube support to the tubesheet.

Optimal computation or light-weight design was carried out for minimum thickness of the tubesheet with the precondition of strength requirements conforming to the design-by-analysis code JB 4732 - 1995. It is found that with the optimization design, the thickness of the tubesheet could be decreased by 31 %, meaning that by using finite element method together with the code of design-by-analysis the thickness of the tubesheet can be significantly reduced...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this study, an {{exhaust gas}} {{recirculation}} (EGR) cooler with dimpled rectangu-lar tubes, whose heat exchange effectiveness is {{higher than that of}} a conventional cooler, is developed. To maximize the heat transfer between the exhaust gas and coolant, the dimples are formed {{on the surface of the}} heat exchange tubes. A dimpled-tube manufacturing process is established that comprises: dimple shape forming, edge bending, centre v-notch bending, compression, and plasmawelding. The high effectiveness of the dimple-type EGR cooler is con-firmedby the effectiveness-NTUmethod and experimental approaches under normal operating conditions. It is also important to verify the structural integrity, in view of the practical uses of the dimple-type EGR cooler. In order to confirm the safety of the EGR cooler, finite element analyses are carried out for each component, such as the oval core tube with a dimpled shape. The structural integrity under thermal stress and pressure, which are caused by gas and coolant flows in the <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> <b>tubes,</b> is evaluated through thermal and structural analyses...|$|R
40|$|The Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP), {{which is}} an {{advanced}} high temperature gas reactor (HTGR) concept with emphasis on production of both electricity and hydrogen, involves helium as the coolant and a closed-cycle gas turbine for power generation with a core outlet/gas turbine inlet temperature of 900 - 1000 C. In the indirect cycle system, an intermediate heat exchanger is used to transfer the heat from primary helium from the core to the secondary fluid, which can be helium, nitrogen/helium mixture, or a molten salt. The system concept for the vary high temperature reactor (VHTR) can be a reactor based on the prismatic block of the GT-MHR developed by a consortium led by General Atomics in the U. S. or based on the PBMR design developed by ESKOM of South Africa and British Nuclear Fuels of U. K. This report has made an assessment on the issues pertaining to the intermediate heat exchanger (IHX) for the NGNP. A detailed thermal hydraulic analysis, using models developed at ANL, was performed to calculate heat transfer, temperature distribution, and pressure drop. Two IHX designs namely, <b>shell</b> <b>and</b> straight <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> compact heat exchangers were considered in an earlier assessment.
