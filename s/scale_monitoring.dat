It consists in a Shack-Hartmann-kind technique made of synchronized independent modules measuring the angle of arrival (AA) fluctuations in a given direction, at different points of the wavefront (3 at the moment, 4 in a near future), with baselines varying from 14 cm to several tens of meters in any direction. The Fried parameter r 0 and the spatial coherence outer scale L 0 are derived from the spatial variance and covariances of the AA measured with several pairs of modules. Their temporal cross-spectrum contains spatio-temporal information. The new version of GSM can track a star, particularly needed in the southern hemisphere, which implies [...] ...|$|R

But does large <b>scale</b> <b>monitoring</b> jeopardize the system anonymity? In this work we present the first large <b>scale</b> <b>monitoring</b> architecture and experiments on the I 2 P network, a low-latency message-oriented anonymous network. We characterize the file-sharing environment within I 2 P, and evaluate if this monitoring affects the anonymity provided by the network.

We also demonstrate that group-based profiling is feasible on this particular network...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Large <b>scale</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{of power}} quality in {{electrical}} apparatuses is nowadays a pressing need {{due to the}} liberalization of electrical market and the deeper interconnections of electrical networks. Many instruments are today available on the market. Even if they grant good accuracy and measurement capability, they are generally developed for single point measurements. Their use in large <b>scale</b> <b>monitoring</b> leads to high costs. These costs are also due to the accurate processing tasks they shall realize. In this framework research activity, the authors aim at the realization of a measurement instrument for power quality monitoring in compliance with IEC 61000 - 4 - 30 and 61000 - 4 - 7 standards capable of granting good accuracy, satisfying repeatability, and cost effectiveness since the use in large <b>scale</b> <b>monitoring</b> is allowed.

40|$|Monitoring {{of species}} and their {{ecosystem}} attributes {{is a fundamental}} requirement in applied ecology and conservation. However, landscape <b>scale</b> <b>monitoring</b> requires an immense effort and commitment, especially when species have a wide distribution or are migratory in nature. Participatory monitoring, whereby local communities are engaged, is increasingly being proposed to address landscape <b>scale</b> <b>monitoring.</b> Its implementation is met with many challenges related to finances, motivation of the local people, lack of trained manpower, and nondirect legal use of the species in question. It is of interest to determine what makes a participatory monitoring program interesting for locals to ensure their long term engagement. Using the unique 26 -year program of hunters' observations of moose (Alces alces) in Sweden as a case study, we present the evolution of this highly successful participatory monitoring program and show that tackling the motivation to monitor, early involvement of local NGOs, social activities revolving around use of the resource, the biology and economic value of the species, and technical and practical aspects related to the monitoring, together create a successful participatory monitoring program. When users benefit directly from the resource, participate in conservation/management decision making, socialize with other participants, and get rewards for their commitment and effective monitoring, participatory monitoring schemes can then become rewarding and sustainable...|$|E
