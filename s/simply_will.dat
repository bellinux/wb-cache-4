500|$|Roger Ebert called Philosopher's Stone [...] "a classic," [...] {{giving the}} film {{four out of}} four stars, and {{particularly}} praising the Quidditch scenes' visual effects. Praise was echoed by both The Telegraph and Empire reviewers, with Alan Morrison of the latter naming it the film's [...] "stand-out sequence". Brian Linder of IGN.com also gave the film a positive review, but concluded that it [...] "isn't perfect, but for me it's a nice supplement to a book series that I love". Although criticising the final half-hour, Jeanne Aufmuth of Palo Alto Online stated that the film would [...] "enchant even the most cynical of moviegoers." [...] USA Today reviewer Claudia Puig gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, especially praising the set design and Robbie Coltrane's portrayal of Hagrid, but criticised John Williams' score and concluded [...] "ultimately many of the book's readers may wish for a more magical incarnation." [...] The sets, design, cinematography, effects and principal cast were all given praise from Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter, although he deemed John Williams' score [...] "a great clanging, banging music box that <b>simply</b> <b>will</b> not shut up." [...] Todd [...] McCarthy of Variety compared the film positively with Gone with the Wind and put [...] "The script is faithful, the actors are just right, the sets, costumes, makeup and effects match and sometimes exceed anything one could imagine." [...] Jonathan Foreman [...] of the New York Post recalled that the film was [...] "remarkably faithful," [...] to its literary counterpart as well as a [...] "consistently entertaining if overlong adaptation." ...|$|E
500|$|The tour {{received}} numerous positive {{reviews from}} critics. Terry Mathews from The Sulphur Springs News-Telegram, {{in his review}} of the concert held at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, opined that the show was [...] "equally enormous and bombastic as it was intimate" [...] {{and that there was}} a [...] "joyful atmosphere after the show", which proved that Shakira [...] "had done her job". However, she also felt that the [...] "fast paced, familiar tracks" [...] of She Wolf should have been included more on the setlist rather than the [...] "still unknown singles" [...] of Sale el Sol. Mikael Wood from the Los Angeles Times, in his review of the concert held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, also complimented Shakira's charisma and praised her for not going over the top, instead noting that she was [...] "carrying out a plan, skillfully and with no shortage of superstar charisma". Dakin Hardwick from SpinningPlatters.com, in his review of the concert held at the Oracle Arena in Oakland, praised Shakira's interaction with the fans and called her [...] "truly one of the great performers", commenting that [...] "the woman <b>simply</b> <b>will</b> not stop dancing". Jim Farber from New York Daily News, in his review of the concert held at Madison Square Garden in New York, felt that Shakira's voice lacked sensuality and that it [...] "displayed a clucky, burpy style". However, he also said that her energetic live performance and ability to dance [...] "smoothed out her rougher elements", and that she [...] "whipped up the kind of charisma that doesn't need to come from any particular place to charm". Jon Pareles from The New York Times, in his review of the concert held at Madison Square Garden in New York, praised Shakira's multi-cultural approach during the show and called it [...] "globalization" [...] with [...] "pure positive thinking" [...] and Shakira a [...] "star with a conscience". Mick Stingley from The Hollywood Reporter, in his review of the concert held at Madison Square Garden in New York, said that the show [...] "cemented Shakira's place as an arena-rock star", and concluded that the concert was an [...] "effervescent message of love from a world music diva with dance fever".|$|E

2500|$|Historians portray Conservative Prime Minister Lord Salisbury (1830–1903) as {{a talented}} leader {{who was an}} icon of traditional, aristocratic conservatism. Historian Robert Blake has {{concluded}} that Salisbury was [...] "a great foreign minister, [...] essentially negative, indeed reactionary in home affairs". Professor P.T. Marsh’s estimate is more favourable; he portrays Salisbury as a leader who [...] "held back the popular tide for twenty years." [...] Professor Paul Smith argues that, [...] "into the 'progressive' strain of [...] modern Conservatism he <b>simply</b> <b>will</b> not fit." [...] Professor H.C.G. Matthew points to [...] "the narrow cynicism of Salisbury". One admirer of Salisbury, Maurice Cowling agrees that Salisbury found the democracy born of the 1867 and 1884 Reform Acts as [...] "perhaps less objectionable than he had expected—succeeding, through his public persona, in mitigating some part of its nastiness." ...|$|E

Tad persists in warning Dixie about Adam's true intentions, but she <b>simply</b> <b>will</b> not listen. [...] "I'm his wife, Tad, of course he loves me!" [...] is what Dixie often replies whenever Tad suggests that Adam is only after the baby. Despite Dixie's stubbornness and refusal to face the truth, Tad persists in warning his beloved, and his insistence gets him beaten up by Adam's thugs. Dixie nurses her best friend back to health, and the two once again feel the closeness they shared {{at the beginning of}} their friendship. On the day Adam Jr. (later known as JR) is born, Tad reveals to Dixie that he wants more than friendship from her. He has fallen in love with the girl from Pigeon Hollow and finally admits his true feelings. Although it is obvious (to the audience) that Dixie loves Tad as well, she decides to stay with Adam and tells Tad that they cannot be friends or see each other anymore.|$|E

As the enemy is within, so is the remedy. It is faith and the obedience of a humble heart {{that can make a}} useful servant out of reason. Reason is but desire. The desire for learning, riches and renown [...] "all this is according to reason." [...] Desire for righteousness <b>simply</b> <b>will</b> not work. The world will see to that. [...] "From the works of the law no flesh shall be justified, because there is an inability to do what it requires ... because the declarations of divine truth are not only contrary to reason, but above its reach, and that makes wise men and diviners mad."

2500|$|The 1933 Act was {{the first}} major federal {{legislation}} to regulate the offer and sale of securities. [...] Prior to the Act, regulation of securities was chiefly governed by state laws, commonly referred to as blue sky laws. When Congress enacted the 1933 Act, it left existing state securities laws ("blue sky laws") in place. [...] The '33 Act is based upon a philosophy of disclosure, meaning that the goal of the law is to require issuers to fully disclose all material information that a reasonable shareholder would require in order to make up his or her mind about the potential investment. [...] This {{is very different from the}} philosophy of the blue sky laws, which generally impose so-called [...] "merit reviews." [...] Blue sky laws often impose very specific, qualitative requirements on offerings, and if a company does not meet the requirements in that state then it <b>simply</b> <b>will</b> not be allowed to do a registered offering there, no matter how fully its faults are disclosed in the prospectus. [...] Recently, however, the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 added a new Section 18 to the '33 Act which preempts blue sky law merit review of certain kinds of offerings.|$|E

Real progress bears the same relation to it that a happy girl laughing bears to an hysterical girl who cannot stop laughing. But I have described this atmosphere first {{because it is the}} only atmosphere in which such a thing as the Eugenist legislation could be proposed among men. All other ages would have called it to some kind of logical account, however academic or narrow. The lowest sophist in the Greek schools would remember enough of Socrates to force the Eugenist to tell him (at least) whether Midias was segregated because he was curable or because he was incurable. The meanest Thomist of the mediæval monasteries would have the sense to see that you cannot discuss a madman when you have not discussed a man. The most owlish Calvinist commentator in the seventeenth century would ask the Eugenist to reconcile such Bible texts as derided fools with the other Bible texts that praised them. The dullest shopkeeper in Paris in 1790 would have asked what were the Rights of Man, if they did not include the rights of the lover, the husband, and the father.
