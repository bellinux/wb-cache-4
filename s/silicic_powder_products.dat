Two complementary {{techniques were}} employed to follow this process leading to silicalite- 1 zeolite upon heating. The formation of small silicates and specific oligomers involved in the assembly of silicalite- 1 nanoprecursors was investigated using 29 Si NMR. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was used to follow processes at a colloidal level. Dissoln. and polymn. of silicic acid could then be related to events occurring at both mol. and colloidal scales. The appearance of very well-defined colloidal particles was linked to a specific intermediate already obsd. in systems using an org. and monomeric silica source. In situ time-resolved ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) using synchrotron radiation showed a linear growth of the av. crystal diam., which was slower than of that encountered in Na+ contg. synthesis mixts.
