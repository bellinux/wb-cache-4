40|$|Reverse {{mortgage}} (RM) {{products are}} growing increasingly popular in many developed countries. This article designs a tranching security {{to deal with}} longevity and house price risks for RM products. The <b>securitisation</b> <b>structure</b> for RM products, the collateralised reverse mortgage obligation (CRMO), {{is similar to that}} for the collateralised debt obligation (CDO). However, unlike the CDO, the CRMO takes into account the dynamics of future mortality rates and house price returns instead of the default rate. To capture longevity risk for RM borrowers, this study employs the CBD model to project future mortality rates, as well as compares these results with those from the Lee-Carter model and static mortality table. The house price return dynamics is modelled using an ARMA-GARCH process. The calculation of fair spreads of CRMO in different tranches is illustrated under the risk-neutral valuation framework. On the basis of mortality experience and the programme of Home Equity Conversion Mortgage in the United States, this research demonstrates the problems of using static mortality tables and models risk for pricing fair spreads for CRMO numerically. ...|$|E
50|$|Ireland has a well {{developed}} market for financial derivatives, with its annual value being measured in $ billions. Most common are {{interest rate swaps}} and foreign exchange transactions used by businesses to manage their risk and support their currency requirements. Ireland's strong funds and insurance sectors are also significant users of derivatives, as are other special purpose vehicles located in the country such as <b>securitisation</b> <b>structures.</b> The majority of transactions involve the major banks and they in turn tend to enter into contracts with institutions outside Ireland, particularly in the EU. The Irish Stock Exchange also has the facility for exchange traded derivatives. Ireland's proximity to London, shared language and time zone is a benefit to its financial services industry. There is a depth of knowledge in Irish institutions and education establishments which supports the financial derivative industry.|$|R
40|$|Securitisation {{has been}} viewed as a key bank funding, risk {{management}} and performance improvement tool {{over the last two}} decades. However, the financial crisis of 2007 - 2009 has shown that engagement in securitisation might create significant financial problems for banks and consequently lead to widespread problems in the financial sector. This, therefore, has underlined the importance of understanding banks’ securitisation activities, the benefits and risks inherent, and the consequences for the financial system. This thesis comprises empirical research on the effects of securitisation on banks. The work is presented in three essays. The first essay investigates whether banks improve their performance through the use of the securitisation market by applying a propensity score matching approach. Specifically, we attempt to assess whether the access to the securitisation market led to lower cost of funding, less credit risk exposure, and higher profitability. Using US commercial bank data from 2001 to 2008, we first test these hypotheses using univariate analysis and find that securitising banks are, on average, more profitable institutions, with higher credit risk exposure, and higher cost of funding. However, the propensity score matching analysis does not provide evidence to suggest that securitisation had a significant impact upon bank performance. In other words, the analysis shows that securitisers would have had comparable cost of funding, credit risk, and profitability had they remained non-securitising. This evidence leads us to conclude that securitisation does not seem to outperform alternative funding, risk management, and profitability improvement techniques used by non-securitising banks that have ex-ante similar characteristics to those securitising. The second essay investigates the impact of securitisation on the credit-risk taking behaviour of banks. Using US bank holding company data from 2001 to 2007, we find that banks with a greater balance of outstanding securitised assets choose asset portfolios of lower credit risk. Examining securitisations by the type of underlying assets, we find that the negative relationship between outstanding securitisation and risk taking is primarily driven by securitisations of mortgages, home equity lines of credit, and other consumer loans. Securitisations of all other types of assets, on the other hand, seem to have no significant impact on bank credit-risk taking behaviour. We attribute these results to the recourse commonly provided in securitisation transactions, as it might alter the risk-taking appetite of the issuing banks across asset classes. Therefore, we conclude that the net impact of securitisation on the riskiness of issuing banks, and consequently on the soundness of the banking system, is ambiguous and will depend on the structure of transactions. In particular, it will depend on the relative magnitude of credit support provided by banks. The third essay examines the relationship between banks’ off-balance sheet <b>securitisation</b> <b>structures</b> and insolvency risk, with a particular focus on credit and liquidity support provided by these banks. Additionally, it examines the risk effect of credit-enhancing facilities and liquidity commitments provided by banks to <b>securitisation</b> <b>structures</b> of other institutions. Using US bank holding company data for the period from 2002 to 2007, we first find that credit enhancements provided by originating banks in their <b>securitisation</b> <b>structures</b> have a significant positive effect on insolvency risk of the banks. Second, examining credit enhancements by the form of underlying facility, we find that among credit-enhancing interest-only strips, subordinated securities, and standby letters of credit, the latter have the greatest positive association with bank insolvency risk. In contrast, liquidity provisions are found to have a significant risk-reducing effect. Finally, examining credit and liquidity support provided by banks to third-party <b>securitisation</b> <b>structures,</b> we find that credit enhancing third-party securitisations reduces insolvency risk of the banks, while liquidity provisions are found to be highly positively associated with their insolvency. Summarising the main findings, the first essay finds no evidence of significant causal effects of securitisation on performance of securitising banks. The second essay finds evidence to suggest that outstanding securitisation has a negative impact on the credit-risk taking behaviour of banks; while the third essay finds that the interests retained by banks in connection to securitised assets significantly increase their insolvency risk. This shows that the net risk transfer for originating banks through securitisation might be ambiguous; however banks do account for the retained exposure to the securitised assets reducing credit risk taking. Taken together, the evidence from the three studies suggests that banks predominantly use securitisation for financing purposes rather than as a risk management or performance improvement mechanism. This research contributes to {{a deeper understanding of the}} motives for and consequent implications of securitisation and provides valuable findings for the ongoing discussion of how to redesign the securitisation model and to reform the supervision and regulation of banks’ engagement in securitisation activities in response to the recent financial crisis.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{equity and}} debt securitisation in Germany {{and its implications}} for the property industry. Based on the current market environment the key drivers of change that will lead to an increase in equity and debt securitisation {{within the next five years}} are discussed. Furthermore, the crucial legal requirements and restrictions that will determine the future success of German real estate securitisation are identified. In terms of real estate investment, Germany is the biggest market in Europe. Nevertheless, the total securitised real estate equity has only been € 7 billion as of August 2005. It is broadly anticipated that the introduction of REITs in Germany will promote a fast expansion of the listed property sector. Particularly by eliminating the current tax disadvantages and by providing corporates and private equity investors with an attractive exit vehicle for their property portfolios. On the debt side, 70 % of all German real estate is funded through the use of traditional bank loans. Apart from synthetic debt <b>securitisation</b> <b>structures</b> and the German Pfandbrief market, which exceeds a volume of over € 1 trillion, international capital market instruments have not yet been established. However, recent changes in the German legal landscape have opened the door for true-sale securitisation deals. The advantages of true-sale transactions, such as higher LTVs, will determine the significant expected growth in the German real estate debt securitisation market. – 1...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{political}} changes in Eastern Europe took place, banks {{in this region}} have experienced a significant reorganization in structure, core activities and business understanding. These changes {{have led to the}} development of banking entities which are flexible, open to the new banking perspectives and react promptly to market changes. However, extensively growing Central and Eastern European (“CEE”) markets require financial sources to meet the increasing demand for core banking intermediation. In order to maintain future growth banks will search for funding instruments which allow them to grow without having a balance sheet effect. In this respect structured finance (especially asset securitisation) may be a solution for these banks and also for other institutions looking for diversified funding sources or credit risk mitigants. It is expected that trend to use <b>securitisation</b> <b>structures</b> will gain on importance due to the decrease in the availability of core funding instrument which are currently deposits. CEE banks’ customers are becoming more aware of possibilities on how to allocate their capital efficiently therefore conventional banking and battle for traditional funding sources will become more expensive. Although, recent market turbulences have significantly reduced the demand for structured finance products in developed economies, the role of these instruments will not lose on importance in the future. The growing sophistication of CEE banking industry will force banks to create products which enable them to attract liquidity by more advanced means. Covered bonds, ECB repurchase agreements and privately placed securitisation transactions can give flexibility towards active balance sheet management in the times of significant liquidity problems. The development organisations like KfW, EBRD, IFC or FMO due to their statutory responsibilities can serve as intermediaries and “market maker” investors. <b>Structured</b> Finance, Asset <b>Securitisation...</b>|$|R
40|$|Current {{explanations}} for securitisation rely predominantly on empirical logistic regression models. Quantitative models predicting {{the likelihood of}} securitisation do not consider all {{of the factors that}} influence the securitisation decision. In combination with conflicting extant literature and a lack of industry evidence, the answer to why some firms securitise and others do not is incomplete. This study examines how New Zealand (NZ) non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) make the decision to adopt and use securitisation and how that compares to extant theory. The background theory of capital structure is alone unable to address the research question, therefore a multidisciplinary framework is used to determine what could contribute {{to an understanding of the}} decision to adopt and use securitisation. Four case studies are carried out in NZ NBFIs and the findings are compared to literature from Finance, Decision Research, Psychology, and their related sub-disciplines. This research highlights the usefulness of a multidisciplinary approach to examining corporate finance decisions and the complementary nature of quantitative and qualitative models. Firm and region-specific information improves understanding of the securitisation decision at the micro level in areas previously unexplained by macro level theory. While NZ NBFIs make the decision to adopt and use securitisation in a manner consistent with aspects of <b>securitisation</b> and capital <b>structure</b> literature, this study provides insights into problems surrounding information availability, the importance of information sources and the reliance firms place on such information, decision-making methods utilised, the factors and process involved in selecting securitisation over alternative financing, and why some characteristics of securitisers in NZ differ from what is expected by quantitative securitisation models.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{determinants of}} launch spreads in European securitization transactions {{over the last}} decade. First, we develop a simple, reduced-form pricing model for all issues across different transaction types and test it. We document the critical importance of credit ratings without refinements as the key pricing factors for structured finance securities at launch. Next, we show that other price determinants, such as placement characteristics, are consistently significant in their impact on spreads and delineate the opposing effects of liquidity and market segmentation. Finally, we show that other factors that might directly affect investors` payoffs, such as creditors` rights, exhibit consistent relationships to launch spreads beyond the credit rating. Hence, we conjecture that credit rating agencies systematically differ from investors in their assessment of certain issues` and markets` characteristics. <b>Securitisations,</b> Credit Ratings, <b>Structured</b> Finance, Bond Markets, Asset Pricing, Liquidity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{deals with}} the subject of Real Estate Securitisation. The main {{question}} is: What is Securitisation {{and how does it}} benefit the property industry? The paper first defines Securitisation and Real Estate Securitisation, and then analyses how Real Estate Asset-Backed Securities differ from Mortgage-Backed Securities. Thereafter the author will {{take a look at the}} European Securitisation market to support the relevance of the topic. After that the basics of Asset-Backed Security Financing will be explained. The main topic that will be discussed in the paper is: What are the benefits of this financing alternative to the players in the property industry and what are the limits of these transactions? Firstly, real estate assets have to fulfil certain criteria to be able to qualify for an Asset-Backed Security transaction. Secondly, three angles of how to view a Real Estate Securitisation can be distinguished. This will lead to a division in different transaction categories. Depending on the motives of the company there are various ways of how a <b>Securitisation</b> can be <b>structured.</b> For illustration, some examples from past transactions are depicted...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{two main}} {{features of the}} financialisation period, namely: 1) {{the replacement of the}} 'originate and hold' banking model with the 'originate and distribute' banking model; 2) the <b>securitisation</b> process of <b>structured</b> finance products. These features have produced remarkable changes in the nature and role of banks and financial markets in modern economies. The paper shows that these remarkable changes together with inadequate governance arrangements and relaxed supervision by regulatory authorities have led to an increasing role of financial intermediaries and managers in the economy, which in turn, has had substantial stratification effects on employment and income opportunities of different occupations, gender and ethnic groups of the US labour force during the great recession. financialisation, great recession, securitisation, ethnic inequality, gender inequality, recessions, USA, United States, labour force, banks, banking, hold models, originate models, distribute models, distribution models, structured finance products, financial markets, inadequate governance, relaxed supervision, regulatory authorities, regulation, financial intermediaries, financial managers, economy, stratification, employment, income opportunities, unemployment, occupations, ethnic groups, men, women, public policy, economic policies, alternative paradigms,...|$|R
40|$|<b>Securitisation,</b> as a <b>structured</b> {{financial}} instrument, {{can give}} rise to excessive risk taking by the originator. It was expected that credit-rating agencies will assist the Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) and investors by revealing the risk. However, given that they pursue their own objectives, of increasing business volume and revenue, credit-rating agencies may not pay attention to investor risks though they claim to do so. This study defines regulatory practices against this backdrop. It is obvious that regulatory measures can be directed to the originator, SPV, or the credit-rating agency. We attempt a comparative evaluation and arrive at an efficient design of regulatory mechanisms and derive the implied credit ratings. In particular, we show that an efficient regulatory practice will be to require a deposit, proportional {{to the amount of}} receivables being securitised, from the originator. securitisation; credit ratings; regulation; regulatory practices; structured instrument; financial instruments; excessive risk; credit agencies; special purpose vehicles; SPVs; investors; business volume; business revenues; originators; regulatory mechanisms; receivables; globalisation; trade; global markets; global economy; policy analysis. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} chapter we {{introduce}} securitisations and discuss {{the current state of}} structured finance in Europe; we also explore the main trends in securitisations and future prospects. Next, we provide a general introduction to the theoretical and empirical literature concerning <b>securitisations</b> and <b>structured</b> finance more generally: we discuss theoretical hypotheses concerning different rationales for structured credit and explore the empirical literature on the topic. In the second chapter, we look at financial contracts determining implicit boundaries of a firm. In the spirit of the incomplete contract theory, we analyse optimal allocations of control in financial contracts involving limits on managerial discretion and legal separation of assets. Our model explores the interplay between different groups of creditors and managers in a symmetric information environment. The results display optimality conditions for different contracts from asset-backed securities through project finance to debt with covenants vis-a-vis a standard debt contract. In the third chapter, we provide the first systematic testing of the theories of tranching. We find support for asymmetric information and market segmentation explanations for tranching and present evidence on how such different rationales influence the structuring process in practice. We also investigate the impact of tranching on the price of securities at the issue level. In the fourth chapter, we investigate determinants of launch spreads in securitisation transactions. First, we develop a reduced-form pricing model of tranches across different transaction types and test it. We document the importance of credit ratings for prices of structured securities. Next, we test for the effect of tranching on pricing of individual securities. Finally, we develop a simultaneous equations supply and demand model with endogenous structuring to further investigate the effects of structuring on prices at launch. In the fifth chapter, we investigate returns to equity around securitisation dates, and explore how different factors influence the size and the direction of the potential effects. We find significant, positive, and consistent abnormal returns to equity on the pricing date, over longer event windows, and over the period immediately prior to the issue date. We find support for the theory that equity holders in well-capitalised banks and firms with low gearing benefit from securitisations. Furthermore, we show that more developed securitisation markets, larger issuers, and banks in particular all benefit from securitisations. </p...|$|R

40|$|D. Comm. The airline {{industry}} {{is one of}} the fastest-growing industries in the world today. The average international air traffic growth will be approximately 5. 1 % per annum, compared to an average worldwide economic growth of 3. 2 % per annum, for the period 1996 — 2015. This would lead to an estimated yearly demand for aircraft financing of between US 530 and US 545 billion. However, fundamental changes experienced by the air transport industry, due to liberalisation and deregulation resulting from globalisation, led to excessive competition and industry losses. Airlines and financial institutions alike are therefore pressurised to apply innovative financial techniques and methodologies (or new applications of old techniques) to meet the growing financing needs of the industry. Likewise, the expansion of the domestic and regional South African air transport industry and the isolation of the South African financial institutions prior to 1990 also necessitated an assessment of the airline environments and the factors influencing it. The aims of this study are therefore to contribute to the South African field of knowledge of international aircraft financing techniques and methodologies, in order to assess, from a transport economic point of view, the interface between the internal and. external airline environments in terms of a systems approach and the impact of this on aircraft financing; to assess the extent to which airlines could redress their creditworthiness to ensure profitable operations; and to make an original contribution towards this study field {{in the form of a}} more accurate calculation of the net present value (NPV) when options are considered for assetbased financing. In order to achieve the aims of the study, the external, internal and. intangible market airline environments are assessed from a financial manager's viewpoint. The way in which financiers evaluate airline management's ability to manage threats and opportunities from the controllable and uncontrollable variables emanating from these environments was also assessed. The capital markets, transaction <b>structuring,</b> <b>securitisation,</b> and financing techniques and methodologies are then discussed. Finally, some ways in which management could counteract threats and constraints from the environments to maximise system output, and therefore address airline creditworthiness, is discussed. It is concluded that the air transport industry is multi-dimensional, extremely complex and dynamic; that uncontrollable factors, for example, technology and regulation influence an airline's profitability and. thus its creditworthiness; that quality airlines are sought after by financiers; that financiers are evaluating management's business acumen in particular; that a mixture analyses will determine a project's risk, debt capacity and profitability; that strategic planning and a business plan is critical in airline operations; that individual investments should be part of a long-term financial strategy; that a few new developments in aircraft financing are anticipated; that there are numerous ways in which management can cut costs and procure income and that management should be acquainted with available financing techniques and methodologies. This study contributes to an information database of aircraft financing techniques and methodologies that could be used by the South African banking industry. Lastly, a more comprehensive NPV formula makes an original contribution to this study...|$|R
