On-board satellite switching is a technology designed to offer multi-media services, especially in demographically dispersed areas. Nevertheless, full on-board switching techniques are far from maturity. Their implementations have been proven expensive and difficult. There are also high risks involved in launching satellites for the <b>stationary</b> <b>orbit</b> surrounding the earth.

40|$|Circumstellar dust {{particles}} can be captured in a mean motion resonance with a planet and simultaneously {{be affected by}} non-gravitational effects. It is possible to describe the secular variations of a particle orbit in the mean motion resonance analytically using averaged resonant equations. We derive the averaged resonant equations from the equations of motion in near-canonical form. The secular variations of the particle orbit depending on {{the orientation of the}} orbit in space are taken into account. The averaged resonant equations can be derived/confirmed also from Lagrange's planetary equations. We apply the derived theory to the case when the non-gravitational effects are the Poynting [...] Robertson effect, the radial stellar wind, and an interstellar wind. The analytical and numerical results obtained are in excellent agreement. We found that the types of orbits correspond to libration centers of the conservative problem. The averaged resonant equations can lead to a system of equations which hold for stationary points in a subset of resonant variables. Using this system we show analytically that for the considered non-gravitational effects, all stationary points should correspond to <b>orbits</b> which are <b>stationary</b> in interplanetary space after an averaging over a synodic period. In an exact resonance, the <b>stationary</b> <b>orbits</b> are stable. The stability is achieved by a periodic repetition of the evolution during the synodic period.

The idea is very simple. The dynamical friction acting on a small satellite, moving through a stellar galactic halo, makes this satellite slow down. On the other hand, a stellar disk, rotating faster than a satellite, makes it speed up. But the density distributions in radius for disk's and halo's stars in real flat galaxies are quite different (respectively, exponential and power-law).

40|$|The {{classical}} {{problem of}} attitude stability {{in a central}} gravity field is generalized to that on a <b>stationary</b> <b>orbit</b> around a uniformly-rotating asteroid. This generalized problem is studied {{in the framework of}} geometric mechanics. Based on the natural symplectic structure, the non-canonical Hamiltonian structure of the problem is derived. The Poisson tensor, Casimir functions and equations of motion are obtained in a differential geometric method. The equilibrium of the equations of motion, i. e. the equilibrium attitude of the spacecraft, is determined from a global point of view. Nonlinear stability conditions of the equilibrium attitude are obtained with the energy-Casimir method. The nonlinear attitude stability is then investigated versus three parameters of the asteroid, including the ratio of the mean radius to the stationary orbital radius, the harmonic coefficients C 20 and C 22.

40|$|We {{find that}} a steady state bar induces {{transient}} features at low velocities in the solar neighborhood velocity distribution due to the initial response of the disc, following {{the formation of the}} bar. We associate these velocity streams with two quasi-periodic orbital families, librating around the stable x_ 1 (1) and x_ 1 (2) orbits near the bar's outer Lindblad resonance (OLR). In a reference frame moving with the bar, these otherwise <b>stationary</b> <b>orbits</b> precess on a timescale dependent on the strength of the bar, consistent with predictions from a simple Hamiltonian model for the resonance. This behavior allows the two orbital families to reach the solar neighborhood and manifest themselves as clumps in the u-v plane moving away from (x_ 1 (2)), and toward (x_ 1 (1)) the Galactic center. Depending on the bar parameters and time since its formation, this model is consistent with the Pleiades and Coma Berenices, or Pleiades and Sirius moving groups seen in the Hipparcos stellar velocity distribution, if the Milky Way bar angle is 30 <phi_ 0 < 45 [deg] and its pattern speed is Omega_b/Omega_ 0 = 1. 82 ± 0. 07, where Omega_ 0 is the angular velocity of the local standard of rest (LSR). Since the process is recurrent, we can achieve a good match about every six LSR rotations. However, to be consistent with the fraction of stars in the Pleiades, we estimate that the Milky Way bar formed 2 Gyr ago. This model argues against a common dynamical origin for the Hyades and Pleiades moving groups. Comment: 9 pages, 8 figures, Accepted for publication in MNRAS with minor revision...|$|R
