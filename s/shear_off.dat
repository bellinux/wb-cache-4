5|$|On 13 January 1964, a B-52D {{carrying}} two nuclear bombs suffered a structural failure in flight {{that caused the}} tail section to <b>shear</b> <b>off.</b> Four crewmen ejected successfully before the aircraft crashed near Cumberland, Maryland. Two crewmen subsequently perished on the ground because of hypothermia, while another, who was unable to eject, died in the aircraft; both weapons were recovered. This {{was one of several}} incidents caused by failure of the vertical stabilizer.|$|E
25|$|On 1 May 1983, an Israeli Air Force F-15D {{collided}} mid-air with an A-4 Skyhawk {{during a}} training flight, causing the F-15's right wing to <b>shear</b> <b>off</b> almost completely. Despite the damage, {{the pilot was}} able to reach a nearby airbase and land safely – albeit at twice the normal landing speed. The aircraft was subsequently repaired and saw further combat action.|$|E
25|$|The Chief's rock faces, {{especially}} the Grand Wall, exhibit the unique textural patterns which {{result from the}} process of granitic exfoliation. This is the natural means by which large, high-quality granite formations weather, erode, and age. Rather than crumbling and slowly wearing away, large flakes of granite tend to <b>shear</b> <b>off</b> and drop from the face in layers. On impact with the ground below, the shattered flakes become boulders and talus.|$|E
500|$|Greeneville {{suffered}} {{some damage}} in the collision. [...] Beginning at the [...] mark on the submarine's rudder, surface tiles had been <b>sheared</b> <b>off,</b> exposing bare metal, and there were several dents on the rudder's leading edge, one of which had punctured the metal skin. [...] A [...] section of acoustic hull surface treatment tiles below the sail had been <b>sheared</b> <b>off</b> as well.|$|R

25|$|Avia Traffic Company Flight 768 was a {{scheduled}} passenger flight from Bishkek Airport, to Osh Airport {{operated by the}} airline's fleet of four Boeing 737-3YO aircraft. On 22 November 2015 EX-37005, operating the flight, was on final approach to Osh Airport when it touched down hard enough to <b>shear</b> <b>off</b> {{the left and right}} main landing gear. The aircraft skidded off the runway with the left engine being torn from its mount.|$|E
25|$|Lastly, on 3 March, Severn {{destroyed}} the American privateer Ino. American accounts report that Ino grounded outside of Charleston on 7 March. As hr crew {{was attempting to}} free Ino, Severn {{came on the scene}} and launched her boats to board Ino. Inos crew, unaware that the war had ended on 15 February 1815, fired grapeshot and small arms at the British boats, causing them to <b>shear</b> <b>off.</b> Ino crew then set fire to her and took to their boats and some improvised rafts. A schooner that came out from Charleston rescued almost all. The Inos crew believed that Captain Nourse of Severn had known for some days that the war had ended. The delay of payment of the head money may have been due to the need to adjudicate the case.|$|E
500|$|During the engagement, Monitors turret {{began to}} malfunction, making it {{extremely}} difficult to turn and stop at a given position, so the crew simply let the turret continuously turn and fired their guns [...] "on the fly" [...] as they bore on Virginia. Several times, Monitor received direct hits on the turret, causing some bolts to violently <b>shear</b> <b>off</b> and ricochet around inside. The deafening sound of the impact stunned some of the crew, causing nose and ear bleeding. However, neither vessel was able to sink or seriously damage the other. At one point, Virginia attempted to ram, but only struck Monitor a glancing blow and did no damage. The collision did, however, aggravate the damage to Virginias bow from when she had previously rammed Cumberland. Monitor was also unable to do significant damage to Virginia, possibly {{due to the fact}} that her guns were firing with reduced charges, on advice from Commander John Dahlgren, the gun's designer, who lacked the [...] "preliminary information" [...] needed to determine what amount of charge was needed to [...] "pierce, dislocate or dislodge iron plates" [...] of various thicknesses and configurations. During the battle Stodder was stationed at the wheel that controlled the turning of the turret but at one point when he was leaning against its side the turret received a direct hit directly opposite to him which knocked him clear across the inside, rendering him unconscious, at where he was taken below to recover and relieved by Stimers.|$|E

50|$|Before modern {{harvesters}} {{were developed}} in Finland and Sweden, two inventors from Texas developed a crude tracked unit that <b>sheared</b> <b>off</b> trees at the base up to 30 inches in diameter {{was developed in the}} US called The Mammoth Tree <b>Shears.</b> After <b>shearing</b> <b>off</b> the tree, the operator could use his controls to cause the tree to fall either to the right or left. Unlike a harvester, it did not delimb the tree after felling it.|$|R
2500|$|Mount Meager {{lies in the}} Coast Mountains, which extend for [...] from Vancouver to the AlaskanPanhandle. It {{is about}} [...] wide, cut by fjords created by glacial erosion. The Coast Mountains have a {{profound}} effect on British Columbia's climate. Lying just east of the Pacific Ocean, they <b>shear</b> <b>off</b> moisture-laden air coming off the ocean, causing heavy rainfall on their western slopes. This precipitation is among the most extreme in North America, feeding lush forests on the mountain range's western slopes.|$|E
2500|$|The San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge {{suffered}} severe damage, as a [...] {{section of}} the upper deck on the eastern cantilever side fell onto the deck below. The quake caused the Oakland {{side of the bridge}} to shift [...] to the east, and caused the bolts of one section to <b>shear</b> <b>off,</b> sending the [...] section of roadbed crashing down like a trapdoor. Traffic on both decks came to a halt, blocked by the section of roadbed. Police began unsnarling the traffic jam, telling drivers to turn their cars around and drive back the way they had come. Eastbound drivers stuck on the lower deck between the collapse and Yerba Buena Island were routed up to the upper deck and westward back to San Francisco. A miscommunication made by emergency workers at Yerba Buena Island routed some drivers the wrong way; they were directed to the upper deck where they drove eastward toward the collapse site. One of these drivers did not see the open gap in time; the car plunged over the edge and smashed onto the collapsed roadbed. The driver, Anamafi Moala, died, and the passenger was seriously injured. Caltrans removed and replaced the collapsed section, and re-opened the bridge on November 18.|$|E

'Three {{thousand}} birds' are let loose, {{into the whole}} world, with labels round their neck, We are free; imitate us. Holocaust of Royalist and ci-devant trumpery, such as one could still gather, is burnt; pontifical eloquence must be uttered, by handsome Herault, and Pagan orisons offered up.|$|E
60|$|This Summer {{then being}} our Third Campaign, the King {{came to the}} Army, and with Him my Lord Marlborough, and several other Persons of Quality: Among the rest was Count Solmes, a nigh Relation to his Majesty, and Colonel of the great Regiment of Dutch Blue Guards; {{and then it was}} after two or three Marches that my Lord was observ'd to be {{somewhat}} neglected, and his Interest in the Army to decay and cool; and upon a certain Morning, as we were in full March, a Man might judge by what then happened that it was so: For it seems the Count had ordered his Baggage and Sumpters to take Place of my Lord's, and to cut them out of the Line; of which Affront my Lord being inform'd by his Servants, soon found him out, and having caus'd his Baggage to enter the Post which was his due, with his Cane lifted up, and some hard Words in French, 'twas thought by a great many that it would end in a single Combat; but the Count thought fit to <b>shear</b> <b>off,</b> and we heard no more of it.|$|E

50|$|All {{of these}} methods remove {{existing}} contamination, but provide no practical protection in icing conditions. If icing conditions exist, or are expected before takeoff, then anti-icing fluids are used. These are thicker than deicing fluids and resist the effects of snow and rain for some time. They are intended to <b>shear</b> <b>off</b> the aircraft during takeoff and provide no inflight protection.|$|E
40|$|A {{fractured}} {{torque link}} lower sub-assembly and six fractured dowel pins belonging to main under-carriage of an aircraft {{were sent to}} the laboratory for fractographic analysis. Examination revealed that the eye-end of the torque link has opened up by tensile overload while all the dowel bolts got <b>sheared</b> <b>off.</b> There were no evidences of delayed failure like fatigue or stress corrosion cracking. It appears most probable that the main under-carriage has extended beyond the limit resulting in <b>shearing</b> <b>off</b> of all the dowel pins. This might have resulted in excessive load on the torque link lower sub-assembly causing it to fracture...|$|R
