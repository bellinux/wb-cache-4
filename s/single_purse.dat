25|$|Following Clijsters's {{victory in}} the US Open Series and the {{subsequent}} US Open, she collected US$2.2million in prize money, the largest <b>single</b> <b>purse</b> ever won by a female athlete until it was overtaken by Serena Williams when she was awarded a winner's sum of $3.6 million for winning both 2013 US Open Series and the Championship. To that date, Clijsters held a North American hardcourt win-loss record of 36–1.|$|E
50|$|On May 27, 1985, Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year winner Spend A Buck won {{the first}} Jersey Derby at the new Garden State Park, having earlier the same year won the Cherry Hill Mile and the Garden State Stakes, both at Garden State Park, and also the Kentucky Derby. The $2.6 million purse, {{including}} a $2 million bonus put up by Brennan for winning the four races, was the largest <b>single</b> <b>purse</b> in American racing history up to that point.|$|E
50|$|Spend A Buck's owner, Dennis Diaz, {{opted to}} skip the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes and thus trade Spend A Buck's {{chance to win the}} Triple Crown for a shot at the bonus. Cordero, Spend A Buck's regular jockey, was {{committed}} to another race that day, so Hall of Fame jockey Laffit Pincay Jr. rode Spend A Buck at Garden State. Spend A Buck won the Jersey Derby by a neck over eventual Belmont winner Creme Fraiche, capturing a $2.6-million prize, the largest <b>single</b> <b>purse</b> in American racing history. That record stood for 19 years, until Smarty Jones won the 2004 Kentucky Derby and a bonus inspired by Brennan's.|$|E
5000|$|Efren Manalang Reyes, OLD, PLH (born August 26, 1954), {{popularly known}} as Efren [...] "Bata" [...] Reyes and nicknamed 'The Magician', is a Filipino {{professional}} pool player. A winner of over 70 international titles, Reyes {{was the first person}} in history to win World Championships in two different disciplines in pool. Among his numerous titles Reyes is a four-time World eight-ball champion, the 1999 World Nine-ball champion, a three-time US Open champion, a two-time World Pool League champion and a 14-time Derby City Classic champion - including an unprecedented five [...] "Master of the Table" [...] crowns. By defeating Earl Strickland in the inaugural Color of Money event in 1996, Reyes took home the largest <b>single</b> event <b>purse</b> in pool history.Many analysts, fans, and current and former players consider Reyes to be the greatest pool player of all time.|$|R
6000|$|Much have I feared, but am no more afraid, [...] When some chaste beauty by some wretch betrayed, [...] Is drawn {{away with}} such distracted speed, [...] That she anticipates a dreadful deed. [...] Not so do I--Let solid walls impound [...] The captive fair, and dig a moat around; [...] Let there be brazen locks and bars of steel, [...] And keepers cruel, such as never feel; [...] With not a <b>single</b> note the <b>purse</b> supply, [...] And when she begs, let men and maids deny; [...] Be windows there {{from which she}} dare not fall, [...] And help so distant, 'tis in vain to call; [...] Still means of freedom will some Power devise, [...] And from the baffled ruffian snatch his prize.|$|R
5000|$|Tongue Blocking and Lip Pursing are two {{different}} ways of playing the harmonica with your mouth. Tongue Blocking is when put your mouth over three or more holes on the harmonica but you cover all the holes but one with your tongue. This technique gives you the ability to play a variety of sounds. Lip Pursing is playing a <b>single</b> note by <b>pursing</b> the lips and covering only one hole. The Tongue Blocking Technique is used by Little Walter, Sonny Boy Williamson I (John Lee Williamson), Sonny Boy Williamson II (Aleck Ford [...] "Rice" [...] Miller), Big Walter Horton, James Cotton, George Smith,Taj Mahal, among many others. The Lip Pursing Technique is used by Paul Butterfield, Junior Wells, Sugar Blue, Stevie Wonder, Jason Ricci among many others.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background We {{developed}} a skin-level jejunostomy tube (SLJT) procedure for patients undergoing esophagectomy using a skin-level gastrostomy tube (G-tube) (Entristar™; Tyco Healthcare, Mansfield, Mass), {{in order to}} improve their nutrition status and quality of life (QOL). We describe the procedure and the adverse effects of SLJT in patients with esophageal cancer (EC). Methods Over a 24 -month period (March 2008 to March 2010), there were 16 patients (mean age: 61. 8 years; age range: 49 - 75 years; 15 men, 1 woman) who had Stage II or III EC. Primary jejunostomy was performed under general anesthesia during esophagectomy. The technical success and the immediate and delayed complications of the procedure were recorded. Jejunostomy techniques SLJT placement using the G-tube (20 Fr) was performed 20 cm from the Treitz ligament on the side opposing the jejunal mesenterium. The internal retention bolster was exteriorized through an incision in the abdominal wall. A <b>single</b> <b>purse</b> string suture using a 4 - 0 absorbable suture was performed. The internal retention bolster was then inserted into the jejunal lumen via the small incision. The intestine adjacent to the tube was anchored to the peritoneum using a single stitch. Results The SLJT was successfully inserted in all 16 patients. No early complications were documented. Follow-up for a median of 107 days (range, 26 - 320 days) revealed leakage to the skin in four patients, including superficial wound infections in two patients. There were no cases of obstruction of the tube or procedure-related death. Conclusions This SLJT placement technique using the G-tube is a safe procedure in patients with EC and allows the creation of a long-term feeding jejunostomy. </p...|$|E
5000|$|... 1994: The first {{running of}} the Brickyard 400 in 1994 saw the largest crowd to date to witness a NASCAR event, and the <b>single</b> largest race <b>purse</b> to date. Rick Mast won the pole position, {{and became the first}} stock car driver to lead a lap at Indy. Young second-year driver Jeff Gordon took the lead late in the race after Ernie Irvan {{suffered}} a flat tire. Gordon drove on to a historic win in NASCAR's debut at Indy. In an effort to attract more entries, the event was concurrently included on the NASCAR Winston West schedule. No Winston West competitors qualified on speed, but point leader Mike Chase made the field via a Winston West provisional. Gordon's inaugural Brickyard 400 winning car (nicknamed [...] "Booger") is on display at the Hendrick Motorsports museum.|$|R
40|$|SummarySingle {{cells and}} {{multicellular}} tissues rapidly heal wounds. These processes are considered distinct, but one mode of healing—Rho GTPase-dependent formation and closure of a purse string of actin filaments (F-actin) and myosin- 2 around wounds—occurs in single cells [1, 2] and in epithelia [3 – 10]. Here, {{we show that}} wounding of one cell in Xenopus embryos elicits Rho GTPase activation around the wound and at the nearest cell-cell junctions in the neighbor cells. F-actin and myosin- 2 accumulate at the junctions and around the wound itself, and as the resultant actomyosin array closes over the wound site, junctional F-actin and myosin- 2 become mechanically integrated with the actin and myosin- 2 around the wound, forming a hybrid purse string. When cells are ablated rather than wounded, Rho GTPase activation and F-actin accumulation occur at cell-cell junctions surrounding the ablated cell, and the purse string closes {{the hole in the}} epithelium. Elevation of intracellular free calcium, an essential upstream signal for the single-cell wound response [2, 11], also occurs at the cell-cell contacts and in neighbor cells. Thus, the <b>single</b> and multicellular <b>purse</b> string wound responses represent points on a signaling and mechanical continuum that are integrated by cell-cell junctions...|$|R
