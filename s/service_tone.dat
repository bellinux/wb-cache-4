5000|$|Mason's first novel, Battered Soles, was {{published}} by Turnstone Press in 2005. The novel celebrates a fictional pilgrimage from Peterborough, Ontario, to the small village of Lakefield, where there is, Mason asserts, a statue of a blue-skinned Jesus with healing powers {{in the basement of}} St. John's Anglican Church. [...] "Mason blends fiction with reality as he writes about taking this fictional pilgrimage...one weekend in July, 2003. By the time he takes this journey, it has become a mainstay tourist attraction (Swimmer 2006)." [...] In July 2005 the real-world rector of St. John's posted a notice advising confused tourists that there was no such statue {{in the basement of the}} church, but that [...] "anyone wishing an encounter with the living Christ" [...] should join the congregation at Sunday <b>services.</b> The <b>tone</b> of the novel is comic: [...] "More comedy than satire, it resounds of Horace rather than of Juvenal; Chaucer rather than Swift; Leacock rather than Richler (Gallagher 2005)"—but there are some moments of genuine pathos. It was nominated for the Stephen Leacock Medal for Humour in 2005.|$|R

40|$|After the {{presentation}} of the Video Dial <b>Tone</b> <b>Service</b> in the introduction, the various forms of the VDT network are reviewed. The DAVIC General System is used to present the basic model of a Video on Demand system. After a short review of the MPEG, we discuss the ITU view of the Video Dial Tone in an ATM environment and present the three protocol stacks. The ATM Forum specifications for Video on Demand in an ATM environment is a vastly reduced subset of the ITU reference model. We also discuss the problem of the jitter on the MPEG TS packets, jitter which jeopardizes the clock synchronisation. It is in the framework of the ATM Forum view that the Video on Demand scenarios are presented in details. The ATM Forum has also specified the LAN Emulation to integrate ATM in a LAN environment but it is shown that the support for the multimedia is far from adequate. From work going on in different groups, there is a tiny hope for a future convergence. Keywords Video on demand, Video Dial To [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|These {{services}} {{are different from}} cellular mobile telephone systems in that no infrastructure (towers, base stations) is required; communications is point-to-point directly between users. However, this also means that communication range is usually limited to line-of-sight propagation, a few kilometres (miles) {{under the best of}} circumstances, and much less in heavily built up urban areas. Also unlike mobile telephones, operation is push-to-talk; a user must wait for the shared frequency to be clear before transmitting, and all stations on the frequency may hear the transmission. Since both stations are on the same frequency, the receiving station cannot interrupt the transmitter until it has finished. Generally only voice transmission is allowed under personal radio <b>service</b> regulations, although <b>tone</b> and digital selective calling features are allowed in some countries. Some services permit digital data transmission, either as part of digital [...] "text messaging" [...] and GPS location [...] "sharing" [...] with other nearby radios (such as FRS), or the services themselves involve digital voice and data transmissions (such as DPMR446/DMR446).|$|R
40|$|Quality" is the {{big issue}} which is {{currently}} fashionable in healthcare circles in several industrialised countries. In the United Kingdom the government's White paper on the National Health Service (NHS) and subsequent documents stress that "the new NHS will have quality at its heart" 1 and that "high quality care should be a right for every patient". 2 In the United States, a Presidential Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry has recently called for a national effort to improve and sustain the quality of health care. 3 Healthcare purchasers have been demanding, adopting, or developing measures of healthcare performance, and in the United States several national organisations-such as the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), the Foundation for Accountability (FACCT) and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organisations (JACHO), have been developing quality metrics. There has been {{an explosion in the}} development of performance indicators of variable provenance and quality, some of which are on the JACHO's national library of healthcare indicators. Developing, collecting, analysing, and feeding back performance data from healthcare organisations is now big business. In the United Kingdom similar developments are occurring but at a much slower rate reflecting differences in the organisation and financing of health care, the relative lack of routine data, poorly developed information systems, and cultural factors. The recent proposal by the Department of Health in England to establish a framework for assessing performance (measuring aspects of health improvement, fair access, effective delivery of appropriate care, efficiency, the patient experience, and health outcomes) as opposed to simply counting "beans" and relying on the largely discredited "efficiency index" 4 is a welcome and bold step. 5 There is a danger, however, that these efforts will not result in the anticipated gains in quality because of potential conceptual and technical weaknesses in the performance management agenda. This paper discusses some of the issues raised by the use of performance indicators in managing healthcare <b>services.</b> The <b>tone</b> is cautionary {{in the context of the}} rapid investment in and relatively unevaluated adoption of performance indicators as one of the key elements of quality improvement strategies, whether the approach used is one or more of regulation, competition, continuous quality improvement, or financial incentives...|$|R

Klee. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); 2 v (vi, 484 pages) This study examines the second language (L 2) learning of politeness and social interaction in study abroad within a sociocultural and rapport management framework, reporting on longitudinal, ethnographic research of service encounters recorded in situ between L 2 learners of Spanish and local Spanish service providers in Toledo, Spain. Service encounters {{are defined as}} interactions between a customer and a service provider in which some commodity will potentially be exchanged. The {{participants in the study}} were seven U. S. American students who studied abroad for one semester in Spain during 2007. The data consist of naturalistic digital recordings that participants made of themselves while visiting local stores, banks, information desks, and other service providers. The study was longitudinal with five recordings made at the beginning, middle, and end of the semester by each student, for 113 recordings total. Other sources of data included students' weekly journals describing their service encounters and learning of politeness, interviews with participants and local Spaniards, and the researcher's field notes as a participant observer. The findings indicate that, during the semester abroad, participants learned target language norms of politeness regarding requests, openings, and discourse markers. These developments over time in L 2 politeness were connected to students' descriptions about how they learned specific politeness features, namely, through explicit instruction, observation of Spaniards, participation in service encounters, and reactions of interlocutors. Learners managed rapport in <b>service</b> encounters through <b>tone</b> of voice, positive assessments, and other face-enhancing moves...|$|R
