50|$|Lestes barbarus is {{a species}} of {{damselfly}} of the family Lestidae, the spreadwings. Its common names in English include <b>southern</b> emerald <b>damselfly,</b> shy emerald damselfly, and migrant spreadwing.|$|R
50|$|The site is {{of special}} {{interest}} for its population of the internationally rare <b>southern</b> <b>damselfly</b> (Coenagrion mercuriale), which breeds in this small valley near Afon Anghof, above Puncheston. A number of springs and streams support a large population of the damselfly. Amongst the abundant wetland plants is a population of the pale butterwort (Pinguicula lusitanica).|$|E
5000|$|The Preselis have Special Area of Conservation status; the {{citation}} {{states that the}} area is [...] "...exceptional in Wales for the combination of upland and lowland features...". Numerous scarce plant and insect species exist in the hills. The hills {{are the most important}} site in Wales for the declining <b>Southern</b> <b>damselfly,</b> and efforts to restore habitat were underway in 2015.|$|E
50|$|Gweunydd Blaencleddau is {{situated}} {{at the head of}} the Eastern Cleddau river, 1.67 mi south-west of Crymych and covers an area of 149.6 ha of shalow south-west trending valley between 190m and 275m above sea-level. The site was designated an SSSI in 2000 for its biological qualities. It is a mixture of wet heath and damp grassland and has significant populations of the marsh fritillary (Euphydryas aurinia) and the <b>southern</b> <b>damselfly</b> (Coenagrion mercuriale).|$|E
500|$|<b>Southern</b> Emerald <b>Damselfly,</b> first {{recorded}} at Winterton Dunes, Norfolk on 30 July 2002 (Nobes 2003 [...] ); in 2003 & 2004, the species was again seen here and at Sandwich Bay, Kent (Forrest 2005 [...] ), {{but there have}} been no subsequent sightings at either location.|$|R
50|$|A {{valuable}} habitat {{has been}} generated on the Große Aue for {{plants and animals}} typical of water meadows. In the wet biotopes and in the standing and flowing waters there are grass rushes, water violets and blister sedges as well as short-winged coneheads and large marsh grasshoppers. Threatened dragonflies, such as the banded darter, <b>southern</b> emerald <b>damselfly</b> live here as do birds like the whitethroat and little grebe. Reed buntings, reed warblers and snipe also occur here.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{of the bay}} bears {{national}} and international nature conservation designations. These include the Sandwich Bay to Hacklinge Marshes Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), the Sandwich Bay Special Area of Conservation (SAC), the Thanet Coast and Sandwich Bay Special Protection Area for birds (SPA), and the Thanet Coast and Sandwich Bay Ramsar Site. [...] The <b>Southern</b> Emerald <b>damselfly</b> (Lestes barbarus) was found here in 2003, only the second site in Great Britain at which this vagrant species had occurred. [...] There are several Geological Conservation Review sites within the SSSI. The bay {{is also home to}} the Sandwich Bay Bird Observatory Trust and the Monk's Wall nature reserve.|$|R
50|$|Notable {{breeding}} bird species {{that have been}} recorded on the site include the European nightjar, Eurasian hobby and Dartford warbler. Rare dragonflies include the small red damselfly, the <b>southern</b> <b>damselfly</b> and the downy emerald. Other insects recorded include the bog bush cricket. Annual wildlife surveys are carried with {{groups such as the}} Devon Amphibian and Reptile Group (DRAG), the Devon Bat Group, Butterfly Conservation, the Devon Wildlife Trust and the Devon Biodiversity Records Centre helping coordinate the work.|$|E
50|$|There {{is a small}} {{fresh water}} pool called Broad Pool {{at the foot of}} the eastern {{approach}} to the ridge. This pool is known to have existed since 1645, and has dried out and been re-excavated twice. Today it is a protected nature reserve. It lies in a shallow basin on the limestone plateau beneath Cefn Bryn, and consists of an acidic pond, heath and bog, which is important for aquatic plants, amphibians, dragonflies (including <b>Southern</b> <b>Damselfly)</b> and wetland birds.|$|E
5000|$|Cors Bodeilio, near Talwrn, is a {{national}} nature reserve and wetland of international importance. It is a mire in a shallow limestone valley, where fen species prosper. The site contains uncommon species, including fen pondweed, orchids, curlews, lapwings and snipes. [...] Cors Erddreiniog, also {{a national}} nature reserve and located north east of Tregaian, {{has been described as}} the [...] "Jewel in the crown of the Anglesey fens" [...] and is home to the bog myrtle, marsh gentian, <b>southern</b> <b>damselfly</b> and hen harrier.|$|E
50|$|The Woorgreens {{reserve is}} {{considered}} to be the Forest of Dean's best dragonfly site, and over seventeen species have been recorded. Some of the species are scarce and breeding colonies in this area are important. They are supported by the network of other ponds and ditches in the area, such as Kensley pond. Breeding populations recorded include blue-tailed damselfly, large red <b>damselfly,</b> azure <b>damselfly,</b> <b>southern</b> hawker, ruddy sympetrum, broad-bodied chaser and the emperor dragonfly.|$|R
50|$|Fry {{of smooth}} newt was {{reported}} in 2000, the only amphibian reported by the lake. An inventory of damselflies in 1997 resulted in a list of emerald damselfly, red-eyed <b>damselfly,</b> variable <b>damselfly,</b> <b>southern</b> hawker, brilliant emerald, four-spotted chaser, eastern white-faced darter, and black darter. A second inventory in 2000 produced the following list interpreted as a normal amount of species: common hawker, brown hawker, Irish damselfly, variable damselfly, downy emerald, red-eyed damselfly, northern white-faced darter, brilliant emerald, and black darter.|$|R
50|$|A Special Area of Conservation {{has also}} been {{established}} around this north-eastern tributary of the Eastern Cleddau river. The site is designated for habitats including calcium-rich springwater-fed fens - Alkaline fens; the <b>southern</b> <b>damselfly</b> (Coenagrion mercuriale); marsh fritillary butterfly Euphydryas (Eurodryas, Hypodryas) aurinia; purple moor-grass meadows - molinia meadows on calcareous, peaty or clayey-silt-laden soils (Molinion caeruleae); wet heathland with cross-leaved heath Rhostiroedd gwlyb - Northern Atlantic wet heaths with Erica tetralix; very wet mires often identified by an unstable 'quaking' surface - transition mires and quaking bogs; and blanket bogs.|$|E
50|$|Several {{species of}} sundew are found, {{as well as}} many unusual insect species, {{including}} the <b>southern</b> <b>damselfly</b> (Coenagrion mercuriale) and the mole cricket (Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa), both rare in Britain. In 2009, 500 adult southern damselflies were captured and released in the Venn Ottery nature reserve in Devon, which is owned and managed by the Devon Wildlife Trust. The Forest is an important stronghold for a rich variety of fungi, and although these have been heavily gathered in the past, there are control measures now in place to manage this.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the next}} few years {{decommissioning}} work at the UKAEA Winfrith site will require the water table around relevant work areas to be lowered by pumping groundwater from the underlying aquifer. The anticipated discharge for these works is 15 l/s, although occasionally flows may reach 30 l/s, and will discharge into a ditch at the north of the site, which discharges into a sub-channel of the River Frome. Since the River Frome is an SSSI over much of its lower reaches, a preliminary assessment of the likely impacts of this discharge on vulnerable species was made and a list of subsequent work was proposed. The River Frome between Dorchester and Wareham is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a candidate Special Area of Conservation (cSAC). Maps of the extent of the SSSI are given along with the reasons for its designation as a SSSI. The discharge has potential to disrupt the typical water crowfoot habitat in the river and may affect several vulnerable species, including: Otter (Lutra lutra), Water Vole (Arvicola terrestris), White-Clawed Native Crayfish (Austropotamobius pallipes) [now thought to be extinct in the R. Frome], <b>Southern</b> <b>Damselfly</b> (Coenagrion mercuriale), Desmoulin’s Whorl Snail (Vertigo moulinsiana), Fine-lined Pea Mussel (Pisidium tenuilineatum), Medicinal Leech (Hirudo medicinalis) native Brown Trout (Salmo trutta), Brook Lamprey (Lampetra planeri) and Salmon (Salmo salar). Exploratory investigations suggest that the volumetric flow in the river is two orders of magnitude greater than the flow in the ditch itself. As a result, the volume of the discharge is not likely to affect the main river, although any vulnerable species present could be affected, particularly during natural low flow periods during the summer. In contrast, the quality of the water, particularly pH, alkalinity and some heavy metals, discharged to the ditch from pumping could potentially impact the river. Water Quality will vary widely, depending on the location of the pumped source within the Winfrith site and so the effect of each location will need to be considered individually. Visual observation of the ditch shows clear evidence of a significant movement of particulate material, which could impact on the river if flows are maintained at higher than normal levels during pumping. Nearby are potentially confounding influences from the Wool sewage works discharging 200 m upstream of the ditch and two small rivers, the Win and the Bovington stream, which have a similar sized discharge to the ditch and discharge into the R. Frome approximately 1 km downstream of the ditch...|$|E
