25|$|Aerosol paint, {{also called}} spray paint, {{is a type}} of paint that comes in a sealed {{pressurized}} container and is released in a fine spray mist when depressing a valve button. A form of spray painting, aerosol paint leaves a smooth, evenly coated surface, unlike many rolled or brushed paints. In 1949, Ed Seymour of Sycamore, Illinois invented aerosol paint, which he based on the same principle as spray deodorizers and insecticides. The conveyance featured a small can of paint packaged with an aerosol propellant and fitted with a <b>spray</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{sprinklers}} used in lawn irrigation, pop-up <b>spray</b> <b>heads</b> and rotors. <b>Spray</b> <b>heads</b> have a fixed spray pattern, while rotors have one or more streams that rotate. <b>Spray</b> <b>heads</b> are used to cover smaller areas, while rotors are used for larger areas. Golf course rotors are sometimes so large that a single sprinkler is combined with a valve and called a 'valve in head'. When used in a turf area, the sprinklers are installed with {{the top of the}} head flush with the ground surface. When the system is pressurized, the head will pop up out of the ground and water the desired area until the valve closes and shuts off that zone. Once there is no more pressure in the lateral line, the sprinkler head will retract back into the ground. In flower beds or shrub areas, sprinklers may be mounted on above ground risers or even taller pop-up sprinklers may be used and installed flush as in a lawn area.|$|R

Fiber contents of 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt. % and fiber lengths of 6 and 12 mm were investigated. Investigations into the extension material parameters of round tensile specimens, cut out of the plates, and the transfer of these extension parameters in a mathematical approach were used to characterize the fiber orientation...|$|R
50|$|Throughout {{the latter}} part of the 20th century, a number of inventors {{patented}} various coffeemaker designs using an automated form of the drip brew method. Subsequent designs have featured changes in heating elements, <b>spray</b> <b>head,</b> and brew-basket design, as well as the addition of timers and clocks for automatic-start, water filtration, filter and carafe design, and even built-in coffee grinding mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|An {{electric}} drip {{coffee maker}} {{can also be}} referred to as a dripolator. It normally works by admitting water from a cold water reservoir into a flexible hose in the base of the reservoir leading directly to a thin metal tube or heating chamber (usually, of aluminum), where a heating element surrounding the metal tube heats the water. The heated water moves through the machine using the thermosiphon principle. Thermally-induced pressure and the siphoning effect move the heated water through an insulated rubber or vinyl riser hose, into a <b>spray</b> <b>head,</b> and onto the ground coffee, which is contained in a brew basket mounted below the <b>spray</b> <b>head.</b> The coffee passes through a filter and drips down into the carafe. A one-way valve in the tubing prevents water from siphoning back into the reservoir. A thermostat attached to the heating element turns off the heating element as needed to prevent overheating the water in the metal tube (overheating would produce only steam in the supply hose), then turns back on when the water cools below a certain threshold. For a standard 10-12 cup drip coffeemaker, using a more powerful thermostatically-controlled heating element (in terms of wattage produced), can heat increased amounts of water more quickly using larger heating chambers, generally producing higher average water temperatures at the <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> over the entire brewing cycle. This process can be further improved by changing the aluminum construction of most heating chambers to a metal with superior heat transfer qualities, such as copper.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the field}} of [...] "nano" [...] spray drying a new heating system is used to provide the drying gas to produce the particles. The gas flow in the system is laminar and not {{turbulent}} as in common spray drying. The advantage of a laminar flow is that the particles fall straight down from the <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> and do not stick to the glass wall.|$|E
50|$|There must be {{a system}} for {{introducing}} sparge water into the lauter tun. Most systems have a ring of <b>spray</b> <b>heads</b> that ensure an even and gentle introduction of the sparge water. The watering system should not beat down on the grain bed and form a channel.|$|R
5000|$|The belt {{carries the}} cakes around <b>spraying</b> <b>heads,</b> where {{different}} flavours and additives are sprayed onto them. The flavours {{will depend on}} the different types of mochi. However, natural flavours are usually preferred (salt, strawberry, mango, blueberry, apple cinnamon, caramel, almond, salsa, nacho, taco, and tamari seaweed).|$|R
5000|$|The {{next stage}} is cool-down. LNG is sprayed into the tanks via <b>spray</b> <b>heads,</b> which vaporises {{and starts to}} cool the tank. The excess gas is again blown ashore to be re-liquified or burned at a flare stack. Once the tanks reach about [...] the tanks are ready to load bulk.|$|R
5000|$|If leakage is {{encountered}} {{the small and}} [...] "agile" [...] molecules of helium will migrate through the cracks into the part. The vacuum system will carry any tracer gas molecule into the analyzer cell of the magnetic sector mass spectrometer. A signal will inform the operator {{of the value of}} the leakage encountered. Thus correlation between maximum leakage signal and location of helium <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> will allow the operator to pinpoint the leaky area.|$|E
50|$|The drying gas {{enters the}} system via the heater. A {{new kind of}} heater system allows for laminar air flow. The <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> sprays the fine {{droplets}} with a narrow size distribution into the drying chamber. The droplets dry and become solid particles. The solid particles are separated in the electrostatic particle collector. The exhaust gas is filtered and sent to a fume hood or the environment. The inlet temperature is controlled by a temperature sensor.|$|E
50|$|The vacuum {{water system}} fed to a {{centrifugal}} separator, filter, and collection bag {{to allow the}} system to vacuum up the fluids. Waste water would be injected into a disposal bag which would in turn {{be put in the}} waste tank. The fabric material for the shower enclosure was fire-proof beta cloth. The fabric was wrapped around hoops of 109 cm diameter, the top hoop was connected to the ceiling. One of the suggestions was for the nozzle of the suction head to be more flexible, increasing its utitlity. The hose for the <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> connected {{at the top of the}} shower. The shower could be collapsed down to the ground when not in use.|$|E
50|$|Woodward's Modernist {{design has}} been {{variously}} described as {{looking like a}} blown thistle, or dandelion. The sculpture is made of bronze with brass pipes.

50|$|According to {{researchers}} at Texas A&M, at least 20% more water {{will reach the}} soil surface compared to conventional <b>spray</b> <b>heads,</b> which are very susceptible to high wind speed, low relative humidity, temperature, and evaporation losses. This means growers with a center pivot operating at 800 GPM can get an extra 140 to 180 GPM {{to the ground and}} to the crop.|$|R
40|$|The {{transient}} overpressure wave produced upon ignition of a {{solid rocket}} booster is suppressed by providing within the launch platform, a plurality of pipes and <b>spray</b> <b>heads</b> disposed around {{the periphery of the}} exhaust gas plume near its upper end and spraying water into {{the upper end of the}} plume during ignition. A large amount of water, preferably equivalent in mass of exhaust products being ejected, is sprayed into the plume in a direction generally perpendicular to plume flow...|$|R
50|$|Special {{attention}} {{needs to}} be given to safety as related to fire sprinklers when dust protection is installed as a ceiling. A sprinkler impairment plan or solution {{needs to be}} discussed with the safety officer, the building insurance company and the local Fire Marshall prior to any interior protection system installation. Installing the interior protection above the sprinklers is not a solution as a fire could cause a localized hole directly above the fire and this hole would act as a vent trapping the heat above the fire sprinklers or the heat could cause the protection to droop onto sprinkler head thus covering the <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> reducing the effectiveness of the water spray.|$|E
5000|$|In the past, the {{limitations}} of spray drying were the particle size (minimum 2 micrometres), the yield (maximum around 70%), and the sample volume (minimum 50 ml for devices in lab scale). Recently, minimum particle sizes {{have been reduced to}} 300 nm, yields up to 90% are possible, and the sample amount can be as small as 1 ml. These expanded limits are possible due to new technological developments to the <b>spray</b> <b>head,</b> the heating system, and the electrostatic particle collector. To emphasize the small particle sizes possible with this new technology, it has been described as [...] "nano" [...] spray drying. However, the smallest particles produced are in the sub-micrometre range common to fine particles rather than the nanometer scale of ultrafine particles.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to the {{issuance}} of the patent Rotheim had negotiated an agreement with Alf Bjercke's paint factory in 1928, but commercial success was initially limited. The patent was sold to a US company for [...] [...] Commercial exploitation of the patent was not significant until it {{was introduced in the}} United States in the 1940s. Norway Post celebrated the invention by issuing a stamp in 1998. After Rotheim's death the technology made a significant advance with its incorporation into the airbrush. And in the 1940s improvements to the underlying principle of the <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> by the Americans Lyle D. Goodhue and William N. Sullivan allowed the technology to be further adapted, first to insect control, and later in various other applications.|$|E

Set #11 had a tray with one pump, and set #12 had a tray with two pumps. Each pump required the use of 2 D-cell batteries that loaded underneath the tray, out of sight. The sets contained many new clear plastic polystyrene parts consisting of <b>spray</b> <b>heads,</b> dippers, turbines, funnels, small and large liquid chambers, and storage tanks.|$|R

40|$|Mechanism {{controls}} flow {{of liquid}} in fuel-spraying head in combustion chamber responds nonlinearly to pressure of liquid. Shell of spraybar expands or contracts laterally as its internal pressure rises or falls, forcing collar down or up on entry tube. Area of window formed by slots in collar and entry tube thus increases or decreases. Drop in pressure through variable-area orifice increases much more with flow through orifice than does corresponding drop in pressure with flow through fixed-area orifice. In practical terms, lower pump pressure needed with variable orifice for given {{flow of liquid}}. Principle of operation applicable to <b>spraying</b> <b>heads</b> for other fluids...|$|R
50|$|Bunn-O-Matic {{also came}} out with a {{different}} drip-brew machine. In this type of coffeemaker, the machine uses a holding tank or boiler pre-filled with water. When the machine is turned on, all of the water in the holding tank is brought to near boiling point (approximately 200207 °F or 9397 °C) using a thermostatically-controlled heating element. When water is poured into a top-mounted tray, it descends into a funnel and tube which delivers the cold water {{to the bottom of the}} boiler. The less-dense hot water in the boiler is displaced out of the tank and into a tube leading to the <b>spray</b> <b>head,</b> where it drips into a brew basket containing the ground coffee. The pourover, water displacement method of coffeemaking tends to produce brewed coffee at a much faster rate than standard drip designs. Its primary disadvantage is increased electricity consumption in order to preheat the water in the boiler. Additionally, the water displacement method is most efficient when used to brew coffee at the machine's maximum or near-maximum capacity, as typically found in restaurant or office usage. In 1963, Bunn introduced the first automatic coffee brewer, which connected to a waterline for an automatic water feed.|$|E
40|$|A {{system for}} {{cleaning}} and verifying the cleanliness {{of the interior}} surfaces of hollow items, such as small bottles, tanks, pipes and tubes, employs a rotating <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> for supplying a gas-liquid cleaning mixture to the item's surface at a supersonic velocity. The <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> incorporates a plurality of nozzles having diverging cross sections so that the incoming gas-liquid mixture is first converged within the <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> and then diverged through the nozzles, thereby accelerating the mixture to a supersonic velocity. In the preferred embodiment, three nozzles are employed; one forwardly facing nozzle {{at the end of}} the <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> and two oppositely facing angled nozzles exiting on opposite sides of the <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> which balance each other, and therefore impart no net side load on the <b>spray</b> <b>head.</b> A drive mechanism is provided to rotate the <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> and at the same time move the head back and forth within the item to be cleaned. The drive mechanism acts on a long metal tube to which the <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> is fixed, and thus no moving parts are exposed to the interior surfaces of the items to be cleaned, thereby reducing the risk of contamination...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMethods {{of cooling}} monocrystalline and {{polycrystalline}} solar modules with water vaporizing are analysed {{in the paper}} regarding the effects of temperature on performance and its economic relations. Since water usage may present a significant cost {{the aim of the}} research was to create a cooling system that operates without loss of flowing water. Results are evaluated from technical and economic points of view in relation to several countries based on systems with 5 kW capacity. Ideal setting of <b>spray</b> <b>heads</b> at 2 bar pressure was achieved with a distance of 0. 26 m between the <b>spray</b> <b>heads.</b> In our experiment, a temperature following procedure was tested manually. Due to this procedure, the surface of the module can be cooled with an average temperature value that is calculated after cooling, depending on the temperature of the control solar module. Analysing the daily data of monthly production the number of “ideal days” in a given month were estimated. Comparing the temperature decrease as a result of vaporization measured in summer and in autumn showed no significant difference. The results achieved confirm the connection between temperature change and efficiency change of monocrystalline and polycrystalline solar modules (0. 5 %/ 1 °C), discussed in previous scientific literature. Effective application of solar module cooling systems is around 10 – 15 % more expensive than the cost of systems without cooling. In general, under current economic conditions the operation of cooled solar modules is viable mainly in South European countries...|$|R
50|$|Because {{of the way}} {{the water}} is applied in a drip system, {{traditional}} surface applications of timed-release fertilizer are sometimes ineffective, so drip systems often mix liquid fertilizer with the irrigation water. This is called fertigation; fertigation and chemigation (application of pesticides and other chemicals to periodically clean out the system, such as chlorine or sulfuric acid) use chemical injectors such as diaphragm pumps, piston pumps, or aspirators. The chemicals may be added constantly whenever the system is irrigating or at intervals. Fertilizer savings of up to 95% are being reported from recent university field tests using drip fertigation and slow water delivery as compared to timed-release and irrigation by micro <b>spray</b> <b>heads.</b>|$|R
50|$|Thermal {{spraying}} {{need not}} be a dangerous process, if the equipment is treated with care, and correct spraying practices are followed. As with any industrial process, {{there are a number of}} hazards, of which the operator should be aware, and against which specific precautions should be taken. Ideally, equipment should be operated automatically, in enclosures specially designed to extract fumes, reduce noise levels, and prevent direct viewing of the <b>spraying</b> <b>head.</b> Such techniques will also produce coatings that are more consistent. There are occasions when the type of components being treated, or their low production levels, requires manual equipment operation. Under these conditions, a number of hazards, peculiar to thermal spraying, are experienced, in addition to those commonly encountered in production or processing industries.|$|R
